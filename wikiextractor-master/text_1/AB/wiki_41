All eight were originally laid down by Walkers Limited for the Australian Army in the early 1970s. A reorganisation of watercraft responsibilities in the Australian military meant the landing craft were to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), with seven commissioned directly into RAN service during 1973 and 1974, and lead ship transferred from the army to the navy. During the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975, two of the vessels ( and ) were transferred to the new Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF).\n\nDuring their careers, the Australian vessels have operated in support of Operation Navy Help Darwin in 1974–1975, Operation Bel Isi from 1997 to 2003, INTERFET operations in 1999 and 2000, and RAMSI operations from 2003.\n\nThe six remaining RAN vessels were paid off in the 2010s: \"Balikpapan\", , and in 2012; , , and in 2014. They are yet to be replaced in RAN service. As of 2013, the two PNGDF vessels were active, and in 2014, the former \"Labuan\" was transferred to Papua New Guinea as the training ship . \"Brunei\" and \"Tarakan\" were refitted and donated to the Philippine Navy in 2015, commissioning as and . Three additional units of the class - decommissioned units former HMAS \"Balikpapan\", HMAS \"Wewak\" and HMAS \"Betano\" - were loaded on a transport ship in March 2016 for transport to the Philippine Navy.\n\nEight new heavy landing craft were ordered in 1969 as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army's four LSM-1-class landing ship medium and two ALC 50 landing craft after the Landing Ship Medium Mark II project was cancelled. They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The landing craft have a standard displacement of 320 tons, with a full load displacement of 517 tons. They were originally built with two General Motors Detroit 6–71 diesel motors. These were replaced by Caterpillar 3406E diesel engines between 2005 and 2007 for those still in Australian service. The standard ship's company is 16-strong, including two officers. The sensor suite is limited to a Racel Decca Bridgemaster I-band navigational radar. They are fitted with two machine guns for self-defence.\n\nThe LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to three Leopard 1 or two M1A1 Abrams tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers, 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a \"Balikpapan\" class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages. The LCHs can mate their bow ramp to the stern loading dock of the RAN's large amphibious warfare ships when operating in the ship-to-shore role.\n\nAll eight \"Balikpapan\"-class vessels were constructed by Walkers Limited at their shipyard in Maryborough, Queensland. All were laid down during 1971 and 1972, with lead ship entering service with the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron at the end of 1971. After this, responsibility for seagoing Army craft was transferred to the RAN, with the other seven craft directly entering naval service during 1973 and 1974, and \"Balikpapan\" transferring over in late 1974.\n\nIn January 1973, the \"Balikpapan\"s in RAN service were formed together as the First Australian Landing Craft Squadron, based at in Brisbane. In November 1974, and were transferred to the fledgling Papua New Guinea Defence Force, along with five s. Five of the remaining Australian LCHs were deployed in December 1974 following Cyclone Tracy as part of Operation Navy Help Darwin; was undergoing refits at the time.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2003, the LCHs were used to support the Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) in Bougainville, under Operation Bel Isi. Ships deployed on this operation were involved in resupplying the PMG base in Loloho, transport of PMG personnel and humanitarian aid, and coastal patrols. From 1999 onwards, the \"Balikpapan\"s were also tasked with supporting INTERFET operations in East Timor, particularly those relating to the Oecussi enclave. The increase in operational tempo was a major factor in the reactivation of \"Wewak\" in 2000. In 2003, the landing craft began supporting RAMSI operations in the Solomon Islands.\nOn 11 December 2012, \"Wewak\" was decommissioned. \"Balikpapan\" and \"Betano\" were both decommissioned a day later, on 12 December. The other three Australian vessels were decommissioned on 20 November 2014.\n\nAs part of the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea, in November 1974, and were transferred to the fledgling Papua New Guinea Defence Force, along with five \"Attack\"-class patrol boats.\n\nDuring 1985 and 1986, \"Salamaua\" and \"Buna\" underwent refits.\n\nThe two PNG vessels were listed in \"Jane's Fighting Ships\" as non-operational since 2011, and awaiting refits. By 2013, they had been returned to service. \"Labuan\" and \"Tarakan\" delivered humanitarian supplies to remote coastal settlements in the Solomon Islands in September 2014 as part of Australian support efforts in the region.\n\nAfter decommissioning from Australian service, \"Labuan\" was transferred to the PNGDF for use as a training vessel, and was commissioned as on 4 December 2014.\n\n\"Brunei\" and \"Tarakan\" were selected for donation to the Philippine Navy in January 2015. The intention was to improve the Philippines' sealift capability, which was found lacking following Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. The two landing craft were refurbished and fitted with new navigation and safety equipment, at a total cost of A$4 million. Hand-over of the vessel was originally planned for 17 May 2015, but this did not occur. Instead, the Philippine Navy took possession of the vessels at on 23 July, with \"Brunei\" commissioned as and \"Tarakan\" commissioned as . The two landing craft sailed that day for the Philippines, with a formal christening ceremony to be held following their arrival in early August. It has been reported that the vessels will likely be homeported on the island of Palawan.\n\nThe Philippine and Australian governments are in negotiations to sell the three remaining Australian \"Balikpapan\"s to the Philippine Navy, with a deal expected to be reached later in 2015. On 27 July 2015, Philippines president Benigno Aquino III stated as part of his annual state of the nation address that his government intended to purchase all three vessels. All three, the former HMAS \"Balikpapan\", HMAS \"Wewak\", and HMAS \"Betano\", were delivered to the Philippines on March 2016, and were immediately sent for refurbishing works. They will be commissioned to the Philippine Navy on 1 June 2016 as , , and , and will be assigned to the Sealift Amphibious Force. \n\nThere are plans to replace the \"Balikpapan\"s in Australian service with an as-yet-unidentified class of six heavy landing craft. The original replacement project was not due to decide on the design until between 2016 and 2018, with the new class to enter service from 2022. The Department of Defence issued a request for information in early 2011, which may lead to the project being brought forward. As of 2019 there has been no further developments.\n\n"}

It is native to southern California, United States and Baja California, Mexico, where it occurs mainly in chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and oak woodland plant communities at altitudes of 0–2500 m.\n\nIt produces a stemless cluster of long, rigid leaves which end in a sharp point. The leaves are 20–90 cm (rarely to 125 cm) long and 0.7–2 cm wide, and gray-green in color. The leaf edges are finely saw-toothed.\n\nThe single inflorescence grows extremely fast, and reaches 0.9–3 m tall, bearing hundreds of elliptical (bell shaped) white to purplish flowers 3 cm diameter on a densely branched panicle up to 70 cm broad, covering the upper half of the inflorescence. The fruit is a dry winged capsule, which splits open at maturity to release the seeds.\n\nThe plant takes several (usually 5+) years to reach maturity and flower, at which point it usually dies. Most subspecies produce offshoots from the base, so that although the parent plant flowers and dies, a cluster of clones around its base continue to grow and reproduce. It may also grow back from its base after much of its foliage has been scorched off by the wildfires that frequent its range.\n\nThe taxonomy of \"Hesperoyucca whipplei\" is complex and controversial. \"Hesperoyucca\" was described as a genus by Georg Engelmann as long ago as 1892, but it has taken recent DNA analysis to confirm that they are genetically distinct from \"Yucca\". The splitting of \"Hesperoyucca\" from \"Yucca\" is still not widely reflected in available literature or online (for example, the British Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Horticultural Society websites do not recognise the name as current).\n\nAmong those botanists who have treated (or still treat) it as a species of \"Yucca\", six subspecies have been recognised (Hochstätter 2000, 2002, 2004); others have regarded them as varieties. Yet others (e.g. \"Flora of North America\" and the \"Jepson Flora\") do not recognise any subspecies or varieties (within either \"Yucca whipplei\" or \"Hesperoyucca whipplei\" ), as the wide variability within the species precludes the segregation of discrete subspecies.\n\nHochstätter's subspecies are:\n\nThe plant treated as the subspecies \"Yucca whipplei\" subsp. \"newberryi\" has been shown to be genetically distinct, and is often treated as a distinct species, \"Hesperoyucca newberryi\". It is native further east, in Arizona, and differs in the capsules being unwinged or with only slight wings.\n\nIt is pollinated by the California yucca moth (\"Tegeticula maculata\"), a relationship which has become a classic example of symbiosis. The female yucca moth collects up to a dozen sacks of pollen grains called pollinia and forms them into a massive ball. She then flies to another plant and lands on the ovary of a flower. Standing with her head near the stigma, she inserts her ovipositor into the ovary wall and lays a single egg. She then rubs her pollen mass against the central stigmatic depression, ensuring pollination. The pollinated ovary will now produce many seeds, ensuring an ample food supply for the larva. Although many associations of \"Yucca\" and yucca moth exist, \"Tegeticula muculata\" and \"Hesperoyucca whipplei\" form an exclusive relationship.\n\n\n\"Hesperoyucca whipplei\" is used in xeriscaping in Southern California, but reportedly is difficult to grow outside of its native range (although it is widely available from specialist nurseries in the United Kingdom). It is extremely drought tolerant and thrives in clay soils.\n\nIt has been used extensively by Native Americans. Yucca species such as the \"Yucca whipplei\" have been documented to have been used as a fiber and food source by Native Americans in the Southwest cultural region, prior to European settlement efforts.Archaeological evidence show that use of yucca species extends to approximately 5000 years ago within groups such as the Serrano of the San Bernardino Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains of the transverse mountain ranges of Southern California. The Serrano harvested the hearts of the plant during the spring growing season. \"Yucca whipplei\" grows on the rocky slopes and washes of the chaparral area of the transverse mountains of Southern California up to approximately 4000 feet above mean sea level. Harvested plants were chosen based on the growth of the stalk; the hearts were the preferred portion of the plant, and would harvested before the stalk was fully developed. The heart contains the sugars stored to rapidly grow a stalk to flower, and become bitter as the stalk grows in height. The hearts would then be roasted in stone lined pits (earth oven) over several hours in a manner similar to that of agave species. Once cooked, the hearts would be removed and allowed to cool before eating. Uneaten portions could be dried for storage. Though slightly bitter, the stalk and flowers can be harvested and used as food sources as well. The stalks can be prepared roasted in a manner similar to the hearts, while the petals were often parboiled.\nThe long leaves of species such as the \"Yucca whipplei\" are made of strong fibers which can be pounded and scraped to expose long threads which run the length of the leaf. The leaves could be processed in many ways to remove the outer layer of leaf material which could be processed into threads and cords, used for basketry, blankets, and sandals. Green leaves can be heated over coals or directly on flames to heat the leaves. Cooking the leaves removes some of the saponins and allows for easier scraping. Ethnographic accounts dating to 1938 describes the preparation of leaves for fibers as any one of the following: boiling or pit roasting of live leaves to be scraped clean or the pounding or soaking of dry leaves expose fibers. Shells or stone scrapers were often employed to remove outer leaf material from the fibers. Once exposed, these fibers were often soaked in water to soften fiber. The fibers could then be twisted into cordage, used as materials in a basket, or woven into sandals.\nOther groups made use of different varieties of yucca species found throughout the American Southwest. Archaeological evidence shows use of \"Yucca shidigera\" (Mohave yucca) near the area of the U.S.-Mexico border dating as early as 5000 years ago. Residues of yucca were found on some stone tools in a cave site in Texas indicate that yucca was used to secure stone tools to other materials. Ethnographic evidence of the Mogollon has shown the use of the leaves with green leaf matter intact and woven into sandals. The green leaves are fire heated and no scraping or further processing occurs to remove fibers, though the spine is removed from the tip. The whole green leaves are then tightly woven to shape the bed of the sandal, and secured to the foot with cordage ties.\n\n"}
{"id": "1965981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1965981", "title": "Themes in Blade Runner", "text": "Themes in Blade Runner\n\nDespite the initial appearance of an action film, \"Blade Runner\" operates on an unusually rich number of dramatic levels. As with much of the cyberpunk genre, it owes a large debt to film noir, containing and exploring such conventions as the femme fatale, a Chandleresque first-person narration in the Theatrical Version, the questionable moral outlook of the hero—extended here to include even the literal humanity of the hero, as well as the usual dark and shadowy cinematography.\nIt has been argued that \"Blade Runner\" thematically enfolds moral philosophy and philosophy of mind implications of the increasing human mastery of genetic engineering, within the context of classical Greek drama and its notions of hubris—and linguistically, drawing on the poetry of William Blake and the Bible. This is a theme subtly reiterated by the chess game between J. F. Sebastian and Tyrell based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 symbolizing the struggle against mortality imposed by God. The \"Blade Runner\" FAQ offers further interpretation of the chess game, saying that it \"represents the struggle of the replicants against the humans: the humans consider the replicants pawns, to be removed one by one. The individual replicants (pawns) are attempting to become immortal (a queen). At another level, the game between Tyrell and Sebastian represents Batty stalking Tyrell. Tyrell makes a fatal mistake in the chess game, and another fatal mistake trying to reason with Batty.\"\n\n\"Blade Runner\" depicts a future whose fictional distance from present reality has grown sharply smaller to reality in 2020. The film delves into the future implications of technology on the environment and society by reaching into the past using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes and film noir. This tension between past, present and future is apparent in the retrofitted future of \"Blade Runner\", which is high-tech and gleaming in places but elsewhere decayed and old.\n\nA high level of paranoia is present throughout the film with the visual manifestation of corporate power, omnipresent police, probing lights; and in the power over the individual represented particularly by genetic programming of the replicants. Control over the environment is seen on a large scale but also with how animals are created as mere commodities. This oppressive backdrop clarifies why many people are going to the off-world colonies, which clearly parallels the migration to the Americas. The popular 1980s prediction of the United States being economically surpassed by Japan is reflected in the domination of Japanese culture and corporations in the advertising of LA 2019. The film also makes extensive use of eyes and manipulated images to call into question reality and our ability to perceive it.\n\nThis provides an atmosphere of uncertainty for \"Blade Runner's\" central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, a psychological test is used with a number of questions intended to provoke emotion; making it the essential indicator of someone's \"humanity\". The replicants are juxtaposed with human characters who are unempathetic, and while the replicants show passion and concern for one another, the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt the nature of Rick Deckard and forces the audience to reevaluate what it means to be human.\n\nBlade Runner raises the question of whether a constructed being should count as a person. In the movie, replicants lack legal rights and are not regarded as human. Similar questions are raised in later unrelated works such as \"Her\" and \"Westworld\". Some viewers speculate that the name \"Deckard\" may be a deliberate reference, by Philip K. Dick, to philosopher René Descartes; in any case, one of the replicants in the film, arguing for her own personhood, uses Descartes' famous quote, \"I think therefore I am\". While there is no scientific universal test for consciousness in the real world, the replicants' organic nature may make it difficult to reject the notion of their personhood. Artificial intelligence researcher Marcus Hutter asked in 2015, \"How do I know that you (a fellow human) have feelings? I have no way of really knowing that. I just assume that because you are built up similarly to me and I know that I have emotions.\" Hutter argues that replicants are \"built up similarly\" to humans, and might therefore be more likely to be labeled as conscious than an inorganic intelligence would.\n\nEye symbolism appears repeatedly in \"Blade Runner\" and provides insight into themes and characters therein. The film opens with an extreme closeup of an eye which fills the screen reflecting the industrial landscape seen below. \n\nIn Roy's quest to \"meet his maker\" he seeks out Chew, a genetic designer of eyes, who created the eyes of the Nexus-6. When told this, Roy quips, \"Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes\", ironic in that Roy's eyes \"are\" Chew's eyes since he created them, but it also emphasizes the importance of personal experience in the formation of self. Roy and Leon then intimidate Chew with disembodied eyes and he tells them about J. F. Sebastian.\n\nIt is symbolic that the man who designed replicant eyes shows the replicants the way to Tyrell. Eyes are widely regarded as \"windows to the soul\", eye contact being a facet of body language that unconsciously demonstrates intent and emotion and this is used to great effect in \"Blade Runner\". The Voight-Kampff test that determines if you are human measures the emotions, specifically empathy through various biological responses such as fluctuation of the pupil and involuntary dilation of the iris. Tyrell's trifocal glasses are a reflection of his reliance on technology for his power and his myopic vision. Roy eye gouges Tyrell with his thumbs while killing him, a deeply intimate and brutal death that indicates judgement of Tyrell's soul.\nIn some scenes, the glow in the pupils of replicants' eyes creates a sense of artificiality. This effect was produced by cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth shining a light along the optical axis of the camera. According to Ridley Scott, \"that kickback you saw from the replicants' retinas was a bit of a design flaw. I was also trying to say that the eye is really the most important organ in the human body. It's like a two-way mirror; the eye doesn't only see a lot, the eye gives away a lot. A glowing human retina seemed one way of stating that\". Scott considers the glow to be a stylistic device (non-diegetic); only visible to the viewers to help them understand that they are viewing a replicant, almost always occurring after the characters have assumed as much.\n\nThe relationship between sight and memories is referenced several times in \"Blade Runner\". Rachael's visual recollection of her memories, Leon's \"precious photos\", Roy's discussion with Chew and soliloquy at the end, \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe\". However, just as prevalent is the concept that what the eyes see and the resulting memories are not to be trusted. This is a notion emphasized by Rachael's fabricated memories, Deckard's need to confirm a replicant based on more than appearance, and even the printout of Leon's photograph not matching the reality of the Esper visual.\n\nAlso in the Director's Cut, when at the Tyrell corporation the owl's eye pupils glow with a red tint. This was derived from \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", in which real animals are rare and owls are very rare, since they were the first animals to start dying of the pollution which pushed humans Off-World. The red tint indicates that the owl is a replicant.\n\nThere is a subtext of Christian allegory in \"Blade Runner\", particularly in regard to the Roy Batty character. Given the replicants' superhuman abilities, their identity as created beings (by Tyrell) and \"fall from the heavens\" (off-world) makes them analogous to fallen angels. In this context, Roy Batty shares similarities with Lucifer as he prefers to \"reign in hell\" (Earth) rather than \"serve in heaven\". This connection is also apparent when Roy deliberately misquotes William Blake, \"Fiery the angels fell...\" (Blake wrote \"Fiery the angels rose...\" in \"America a Prophecy\"). Nearing the end of his life, Roy creates a stigmata by driving a nail into his hand, and becomes a Christ-like figure by sacrificing himself for Deckard. Upon his death a dove appears to symbolise Roy's soul ascending into the heavens.\n\nZhora's gunshot wounds are both on her shoulder blades. The end result makes her look like an angel whose wings have been cut off. Zhora uses serpent that \"once corrupted man\" in her performance.\n\nA Nietzschean interpretation has also been argued for the film on several occasions. This is especially true for the Batty character, arguably a biased prototype for Nietzsche's Übermensch—not only due to his intrinsic characteristics, but also because of the outlook and demeanor he displays in many significant moments of the film. For instance:\n\nOrson Scott Card wrote of the film, \"It takes place in Los Angeles. No aliens at all. But it isn't the L.A. we know ... things have changed. Lots of things, moving through the background of the film, give us a powerful sense of being in a strange new place\". The climate of the city in A.D. 2019 is very different from today's. It is strongly implied that industrial pollution has adversely affected planet Earth's environment, i.e. global warming and global dimming. Real animals are rare in the Blade Runner world. In Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", animal extinction and human depopulation of the planet were consequent to the radioactive fallout of a nuclear war; Owls were the first species to become extinct. This ties in with Deckard's comment about Dr. Tyrell's artificial owl: \"It must be expensive.\" \"(cf. post-apocalyptic science fiction)\"\n\nGiven the many Asian peoples populating Los Angeles in A.D. 2019, and the cityspeak dialect policeman Gaff speaks to the Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, clearly indicates that much cultural mixing has happened. Globalization also is reflected in the name of the Shimata-Domínguez Corporation, whose slogan proclaims: \"Helping America into the New World\". This indicates that a mass migration is occurring, as there is a status quo that people want to escape. When Sebastian remarks of his downtown building \"No housing shortage around here...plenty of room for everybody\", it mirrors the late twentieth century problems of white flight, and the resulting urban decay in western cities, but on a worldwide scale.\n\nThe cultural and religious mixing can also be verified at the scene where Deckard chases Zhora. In the streets, we can see people dressed traditionally as Jews, hare krishnas, as well as young boys dressed as punks.\n\nIn the Director's Cut and the Final Cut, there is a sequence in which Deckard daydreams about a unicorn; in the final scene, he finds an origami unicorn on the floor outside his apartment, left there by Gaff, suggesting that Gaff knows about Deckard's dream in the same manner that Deckard knows about Rachael's implanted memories. Scott confirmed this interpretation was his intent in the unicorn daydream. \n\nHowever, while memory implantation for replicants is established elsewhere in the movie, it is unclear if daydreams work in the same way. Even without considering this scene, there is other evidence and hints that allow for the possibility of Deckard being a replicant but does not eliminate the possibility of Deckard being human:\n\nPhilip K. Dick wrote the character Deckard as a human in the original novel in order to explore the increasing similarity of humans and replicants. However, the film significantly diverges from the book, e.g. the book states explicitly that Deckard passed the Voight-Kampff test. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher has said that he wrote the character as a human, but wanted the film to suggest the possibility that he may be a replicant. When asked, \"Is Deckard a replicant?\", Fancher replied, \"No. It wasn't like I had a tricky idea about Deckard that way.\" During a discussion panel with Ridley Scott to discuss \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\", Fancher again stated that he believes Deckard is human (saying that \"[Scott's] idea is too complex\"), but also repeated that he prefers the film to remain ambiguous.\n\nHarrison Ford considers Deckard to be human. \"That was the main area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time,\" Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One \"Hollywood Greats\" segment. \"I thought the audience \"deserved\" one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I \"thought\" I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I think he had a little reservation about that. I think he really wanted to have it both ways.\" Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although \"Blade Runner 2049\" director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).\n\nRidley Scott stated in several interviews that he considers Deckard to be a replicant. Syd Mead, the film's visual futurist, agrees with Scott that Deckard is a replicant. The disagreement among the people involved in making \"Blade Runner\" raises interesting questions about authorial intent, including who, if anyone, can make authoritative pronouncements about a film's interpretation.\n\nThe film's visual effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull stated that he doesn't know Deckard's true nature and that the issue is an enigma; similarly, Villeneuve also noted that in \"2049\", \"Deckard [...] is unsure, as we are, of what his identity is\".\n\n\n"}

It was built to compete against the new 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and other FIA World Sportscar Championship races.\n\nIn 1962, the engineer Giotto Bizzarrini was hired by Count Giovanni Volpi, owner of the Scuderia Serenissima racing team, to upgrade a Ferrari 250 GT SWB so it would be competitive with the then-new Ferrari 250 GTO. Enzo Ferrari had refused to sell any GTOs to Count Volpi, due to Volpi's hiring of former Ferrari employees at ATS.\n\nThe donor car for this project was a 250 GT SWB Competition, serial number 2819 GT. This car had previously competed in the 1961 Tour de France, where it took 2nd place overall driven by Olivier Gendebien and Lucien Bianchi. The car was sold by Gendebien to Volpi shortly afterward for use with Scuderia Serenissima. As with other competition-spec SWBs, this car had a lightweight body and chassis, minimal trim, and a more powerful 286 bhp Tipo 168 engine with Testarossa-type heads.\n\nBizzarrini applied all the ideas he had developed working on the GTO and together with the car body specialist Piero Drogo developed an aerodynamically advanced body, even lower than the GTO's, with the roof line dramatically extended to the rear end following Kamm aerodynamic theory. The resulting shooting-brake appearance led to the French press nicknaming it \"\"La Camionnette\"\" (little truck), while the English-speaking journalists called it the \"Breadvan.\"\n\nBizzarrini moved the engine and radiator further back to the center of the chassis than the GTO, and lowered it by fitting a dry sump system. The original three 46 DCN Weber carburetors were replaced with six twin choke 38 DCN Webers. The original 4-speed gearbox was retained. Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini of Modena were contracted to perform all the mechanical modifications and race preparation. The resulting car was significantly lighter than the GTO, at compared to the typical GTO weight of .\n\nThe rebodied Breadvan made its competition debut at the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans. It quickly passed all Ferrari GTOs and was 7th overall during the 4th hour when a driveshaft failure caused its retirement. Results at other races proved the design's effectiveness, as the car won the GT class in two races during the 1962 season. The car's last race in period was at the Coppa Gallenga Hillclimb in 1965, however since 1973 it has appeared regularly at historic races worldwide, including events such as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races, the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Tour Auto.\n\nThe 250 GT SWB Breadvan's unusual but effective aerodynamics proved the Kamm tail design that would be used on many other racing cars, including the Ford J-car and the Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ.\n\nFollowing the success of the Breadvan, two additional 250 GT SWB cars (S/N 2053 GT and 2735 GT) were modified for privateer drivers by Bizzarrini, Drogo, Neri and Bonacini, distinctively bodied with similar shapes. A third modified Ferrari was planned but not completed. An Iso Rivolta, chassis number IR460368, was also rebodied by Drogo in a similar style to 2819 GT.\n\nSimilar shooting brake designs were used on later Ferrari concept cars and production cars such as the 456 GT Venice and the Ferrari FF.\n\n\n"}

Formally, we say that a Riemannian manifold formula_1 is isotropic if for any point formula_2 and unit vectors formula_3, there is an isometry formula_4 of formula_5 with formula_6 and formula_7. Every connected isotropic manifold is homogeneous, i.e. for any formula_8 there is an isometry formula_4 of formula_5 with formula_11 This can be seen by considering a geodesic formula_12 from formula_13 to formula_14 and taking the isometry which fixes formula_15 and maps formula_16 to formula_17\nThe simply-connected space forms (the n-sphere, hyperbolic space, and formula_18) are isotropic. It is not true in general that any constant curvature manifold is isotropic; for example, the flat torus formula_19 is not isotropic. This can be seen by noting that any isometry of formula_20 which fixes a point formula_21 must lift to an isometry of formula_22 which fixes a point and preserves formula_23; thus the group of isometries of formula_20 which fix formula_13 is discrete. Moreover, it can be seen in a same way that no oriented surface with constant curvature and negative Euler characteristic is isotropic.\n\nMoreover, there are isotropic manifolds which do not have constant curvature, such as the complex projective space formula_26 (formula_27) equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. Indeed, all constant curvature manifolds have their universal cover to be either a sphere, or a hyperbolic space, or formula_18, but formula_26 is simply-connected but not a sphere (for formula_27), as can be seen for example from homotopy group calculations from long exact sequence of the fibration formula_31.\n\nFurther examples of isotropic manifolds are given by the rank one symmetric spaces, including the projective spaces formula_32, formula_26, formula_34, and formula_35, as well as their noncompact hyperbolic analogues.\n\nA manifold can be homogeneous but not isotropic, such as the flat torus formula_20 or formula_37 with the product metric.\n\n"}

The town is on the right side of the Po river. The nature of the soil determined over time how the river's sand accumulated.\n\nCarmagnola borders the following municipalities: Poirino, Villastellone, Carignano, Lombriasco, Ceresole Alba, Racconigi, Sommariva del Bosco, Caramagna Piemonte.\n\nThe municipality is mentioned for the first time during the 11th century. The land, originally owned by the Arduinic dynasty, passed to the Marquisate of Saluzzo, who had a castle built here. The Saluzzo dynasty soon underwent a rapid decadence ending with a French domination period which lasted 40 years. In 1588 Carmagnola became a possession of the House of Savoy, when Charles Emmanuel I besieged and conquered it. France took possession of Carmagnola a second time during the 17th century, during the civil war between \"Madamisti\" and \"Principisti\" (supporters of the French and the Savoy dynasty respectively). In this period (1637–1642), the three main subdivisions were razed to the ground as they were conflicting with the defence structures, and immediately re-built around 1.5 km from their original position, where they still are at the present time.\n\nIn 1690 the town was once again occupied by the French general Catinat, but just one year later Victor Amadeus II of Savoy brought it back among Piedmontese possessions. While its defence buildings were being demolished and its strategic role was progressively decreasing in importance, the town could finally develop agriculture and commerce, mainly of hemp and ropes, which were exported in great quantity to Liguria and southern France. The characteristic of both agricultural and commercial site remained important until after World War II, which caused a massive immigration and a rapid urbanistic expansion.\n\nThe name of \"La Carmagnole\", the title of a French song and dance made popular during the French Revolution, is considered to be indirectly derived from the Italian town - i.e., the costume of the Piedmontese peasants living near Carmagnola was named for the town; and when some of these peasants came to Paris, their dress influenced the short jacket worn by working-class militant \"sans-culottes\", who sang the song.\n\n\nThe economy of the town is currently linked to the industry and intensive production of vegetables and cereals, which the particular soil makes very productive. Industry experienced a notable growth during the 1960s, when FIAT opened an important factory, thus attracting a growing number of immigrants from southern Italy. The rapid growth of FIAT made also possible other activities in the metallurgy, electronics, optics, chemical industry, and food industry fields.\nAlso well-developed are the banking, financial and insurance sectors.\n\n\nOn 5 September 2010 during the 61st Pepper Fair the town of Carmagnola has been entered into the Guinness Book of Records for the biggest pepper soup (\"peperonata\") with a weight of 1,190 kg (2,623.5 pounds).\n\n\n"}

Comercial Mexicana, including its different store formats, was the third-largest supermarket chain in Mexico as of 2014.\n\nThe first store, which was opened by Carlos González Nova and his father, Antonino González Abascal, in Mexico City in 1930, primarily sold textile products.\n\nIn January 2015 it was announced that Organización Soriana would buy Comercial Mexicana stores, from which 118 will be fully owned while 42 would be leased and operated by third parties.\n\nComercial Mexicana had different retail formats, with the general stores branded as Comercial Mexicana, the larger stores as Mega Comercial Mexicana and its smaller facilities as Bodega Comercial Mexicana. Many of its general stores were connected to a shopping mall with competing businesses surrounding. An example was in Plaza Río in Tijuana, Baja California, which had a Comercial Mexicana as an anchor store but also has a traditional department store and smaller specialty stores selling items that could be purchased in Comercial Mexicana.\n\nComercial Mexicana also had programs for children. In exchange for working in stores as bag boys, the children received family support, tuition support and educational supplies, and basic services. The children worn almost-trademark brown uniforms with the orange pelican logo and were expected to be well groomed. They helped most of the customers out of the store and return the carts, which in turn kept the shopping cart thefts low.\n\nCarlos González Nova, Comercial Mexicana's co-founder, served as the chairman of the company's board of directors until 1998.

Shortly after his ordination by Metropolitan bishop Sylvester Sembratovych in 1894, he came to the United States in 1895 and settled in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania. In the US, he quickly became involved with missionary work and journalism through the Jersey City, New Jersey paper Svoboda. \n\nNestor Dmytriw was one of the so-called American Circle, a group of young seminarians who, while still in Lviv, resolved to emigrate to the United States in order to improve the religious, civic, and cultural status of the Ukrainian immigrants. Dmytriw and Cyril Genik both “shared in Joseph Oleskow’s views on the needs of the peasantry.” “In 1895, after his ordination, Dmytriw himself arrived in the United States, where he combined missionary work among the Ukrainian industrial labourers of Pennsylvania with journalism. He became associated with the first Ukrainian-language newspaper in North America, Svoboda [Liberty], which originated in Jersey City, N.J. The paper, which featured stories about the immigrant experience in the United States and Canada, was widely read in Galicia and thus became the first major link between North America and Austrian Ukraine.” \n\nIn 1897, Dmytriw travelled from the United States to Canada at Joseph Oleskow’s request. Through the Ruthenian National Association, Dmytriw arrived in April 1897 to serve the spiritual needs of the Ukrainian Canadian settlers. Able to speak Ukrainian, German and English he became an interpreter for Canadian immigration. In Canadian history, Dmytriw's most notable contribution is in writing about the history and tribulations of early Ukrainian settlers.\n\nSt. Michael’s Ukrainian Catholic Church, the oldest surviving Ukrainian Catholic Church in Canada, was built on the site where Father Dmytriw celebrated liturgy on April 12, 1897, shortly upon his arrival in Canada. The parishioners erected a large commemorative cross on the site, and at Dmytriw's suggestion, a log church was built in 1898. The church has since been moved from its original location in the Trembowla area, Rural Municipality of Dauphin.\n\nIn the fall of 1897, Father Dmytriw spoke up in an article in the Winnipeg Free Press defending the Ukrainian immigrants, deflecting a scathing attack on them by another newspaper. Travelling among them as he did, he was able to describe their industriousness and their well-managed homesteads.\n\nDmytriw’s records showed 15 families, with children, 78 persons, were settled in Trembowla, the oldest Ukrainian settlement in the vicinity of Dauphin in 1897. In Winnipeg, the population was 200, some spending their winter in the Immigration Hall, waiting to leave for their homesteads in spring, while others had decided to stay in the city and were looking for employment. As the first Ukrainian priest to visit the prairies, Dmytriw began organizing the first Ukrainian religious groups in the area.\n\nWhile in Alberta in 1897, Dmytriw was informed by Bishop Legal that, “It would be impossible to have two Catholic churches in Canada.” Dmytriw advised the Ukrainian immigrants to be wary of the French clergy, when Legal “secured land for the Ukrainian Catholic church in Edna-Star, then tried to have it registered with his episcopal corporation without consulting the settlers.” \n\nWhen living in Canada, Dmytriw worked at the immigration bureau in Winnipeg. This helped him in his religious endeavors, giving him the funds to travel throughout the western provinces. The Ukrainian settlers were poor and could not help him in this respect.\n\nDmytriw was only in Canada until August 1898. During his stay, he organized the first Ukrainian parishes in Trembowla, Manitoba, Stuartburn, Manitoba and Edna, Alberta and was an advocate of a separate Ukrainian Catholic church in Canada. This was initially opposed by the Canadian Catholic hierarchy, especially Archbishop Adélard Langevin, but came to fruition with the appointment of Nykyta Budka as apostolic exarch for Ukrainian Canadian Catholics.\n\nFather Nestor Dmytriw died on May 27, 1925 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966049", "title": "Gauge (firearms)", "text": "Gauge (firearms)\n\nThe gauge (or commonly bore in British English) of a firearm is a unit of measurement used to express the inner diameter (bore diameter) of the barrel.\n\nGauge is determined from the weight of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the firearm and is expressed as the multiplicative inverse of the sphere's weight as a fraction of a pound, e.g., a one-twelfth pound lead ball fits a 12-gauge bore. Thus there are twelve 12-gauge balls per pound, etc. The term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot; an 8-pounder would fire an 8 lb (3.6 kg) ball.\n\nGauge is commonly used today in reference to shotguns, though historically it was also used in large double rifles, which were made in sizes up to 2 bore during their heyday in the 1880s, being originally loaded with black powder cartridges. These very large rifles, sometimes called \"elephant guns\", were intended for use in Africa and Asia for hunting game.\n\nGauge is abbreviated \"ga.\", \"ga\", or \"G\".\n\nAn \"n\"-gauge diameter means that a ball of lead (density 11.34 g/cm or 0.4097 lb/in) with that diameter has a mass equal to part of the mass of the international avoirdupois pound (approx. 454 grams), that is, that \"n\" such lead balls could be cast from a pound weight of lead. Therefore, an \"n\"-gauge shotgun or \"n\"-bore rifle has a bore diameter (in inches) of approximately\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nThis simplifies to the following formula for the internal diameter of the barrel of an \"n\"-gauge shotgun:\n\nLikewise, given the diameter in inches, the gauge is\n\nThe gauge of firearms is determined by. 1 pound / gauge = weight of lead sphere. Caliber of lead sphere is then measured. This is essential information for understanding gauges.\n\nSince shotguns were not originally intended to fire solid projectiles, but rather a compressible mass of shot, the actual diameter of the bore can vary. The fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter.\n\nThe chamber of the gun is larger, to accommodate the thickness of the shotshell walls, and a \"forcing cone\" in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter. The forcing cone can be as short as a fraction of an inch, or as long as a few inches on some guns. At the muzzle end of the barrel, the choke can constrict the bore even further, so measuring the bore diameter of a shotgun is not a simple process, as it must be done away from either end.\n\nShotgun bores are commonly \"overbored\" or \"backbored\", meaning that most of the bore (from the forcing cone to the choke) is slightly larger than the value given by the formula. This is claimed to reduce felt recoil and improve patterning. The recoil reduction is due to the larger bore producing a slower acceleration of the shot, and the patterning improvements are due to the larger muzzle diameter for the same choke constriction, which results in less shot deformation. A 12-gauge shotgun, nominally , can range from a tight to an extreme overbore of . Some also claim an increased velocity with the overbored barrels, up to , which is due to the larger swept volume of the overbored barrel. Once only found in expensive custom shotguns, overbored barrels are now becoming common in mass-marketed guns. Aftermarket backboring is also commonly done to reduce the weight of the barrel, and move the center of mass backwards for a better balance. Factory overbored barrels generally are made with a larger outside diameter, and will not have this reduction in weight—though the factory barrels will be tougher, since they have a normal barrel wall thickness.\n\nFiring slugs from overbored barrels can result in very inconsistent accuracy, as the slug may be incapable of obturating to fill the oversized bore.\n\nThe most common size is 12 gauge, with up to 50% of the overall shotgun market in the United States. The 20-gauge shotgun is the next most popular size being favored by shooters uncomfortable with the weight and recoil of a 12-gauge gun, and is popular for upland game hunting. The next most popular sizes are 28 gauge and .410 bore. Both the 10 gauge and 16 gauge, while less commonplace, are still available in the United States.\n\nShotguns and shells exceeding 10 gauge, such as the 8 and 4 gauge, are rather rarely manufactured and only a few makers of the otherwise large market of shotgun, rifle and ammo makers across the United States still produce them. Shells are usually black powder paper cartridges as opposed to the plastic or wax cartridge and smokeless powder of today.\n\nThe 11, 15, 18, 2, and 3-gauge shells are rarest of all; owners of these types of rare shotguns will usually have their ammunition custom loaded by a specialist in rare and custom bores. The 14 gauge has not been loaded in the United States since the early 1900s, although the inch hull is still made in France. The very small 24 and 32 gauges are still produced and used in some European and South American countries. Punt guns are rarely encountered.\n\nAlso seen in limited numbers are smoothbore firearms in calibers smaller than .360 such as .22 Long Rifle (UK No.1 bore) and 9mm Flobert rimfire (UK No.3 bore), designed for short range pest control and garden guns. The No.2 bore (7 mm) has long been obsolete. All three of these rimfires are available in shot and BB-cap.\n\nThe 10 gauge narrowly escaped obsolescence when steel and other nontoxic shot became required for waterfowl hunting, since the larger shell could hold the much larger sizes of low-density steel shot needed to reach the ranges necessary for waterfowl hunting. The move to steel shot reduced the use of 16 and 20 gauges for waterfowl hunting, and the smaller 2¾″ (70mm) 12-gauge shells as well. However, the advent of the 12-gauge shell, with its higher SAAMI pressure rating compared to standard 12-gauge guns, begin to approach the performance of the 10-gauge loads. Newer nontoxic shots, such as bismuth and tungsten-nickel-iron alloys, and even tungsten-polymer blends, regain much or all of the performance loss, but are much more expensive than steel or lead shot. However, laboratory research indicates that tungsten alloys can actually be quite toxic internally.\n\nThe below table lists various gauge sizes with weights. The bores marked are found in punt guns and rare weapons only. However, 4 gauge were sometimes found used in blunderbuss guns made for coach defense and protection against piracy. The .410 bore and 23mm caliber are exceptions; they are actual bore sizes, not gauges. If the .410 and 23 mm were measured traditionally, they would be 67.62 gauge and 6.278 gauge, respectively.\n\nNote: Use of this table for estimating bullet masses for historical large-bore rifles is limited, as this table assumes the use of round ball, rather than conical bullets; for example, a typical 4 bore rifle from circa 1880 used a bullet, or sometimes slightly heavier, rather than using a 4-ounce round lead ball. (Round balls give progressively much worse external ballistic performance than conical bullets at ranges greater than about 75 yards.) In contrast, a 4-bore express rifle often used a bullet wrapped in paper to keep lead buildup to a minimum in the barrel. In either case, assuming a 4-ounce mass for a 4-bore rifle bullet from this table would be inaccurate, although indicative.\n\n"}

Set at the beginning of the 15th century in northern Italy, it takes place first in the Marquessate of Montferrat and later in the Duchy of Milan. Most of its characters, including Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Gian Maria Visconti, Facino Cane, Filippo Maria Visconti, and Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola, were real historical figures; the scheming title character is the notable exception.\n\nThe narrative is presented as the author's compilation of histories of Bellarion's life, in particular that of one Fra Serafino of Imola. Bellarion, abandoned as a child and raised in an abbey, departs as a young man with a letter of introduction from the respected abbot, intending to study in Pavia. He meets and travels with a Franciscan friar, but discovers that someone has robbed him of his money and letter. Upon arriving in Casale, the capital of Montferrat, he finds himself pursued by the authorities, who suspect him of complicity with the false friar, actually a well-known scoundrel named Lorenzaccio da Trino. He flees until he reaches a palace and enters by a garden door which he is surprised to find unlocked. A beautiful lady admits him, bolts the door, and takes pains to hide him from his pursuers. They arrive, and Bellarion listens to her rebuff them, discovering that she is the Princess Valeria of Montferrat.\n\nWhen the Guard depart, Valeria quizzes Bellarion, mistaking him for a messenger she had been expecting, asking after Giufreddo and Lord Barbaresco. He corrects her misapprehension, but, sensing an intrigue and anxious to impress her, offers in return for her kindness to carry a message to Lord Barbaresco. She distrusts him, but charges him simply to ask what has become of Giufreddo, who Bellarion assumes is the previous messenger, and how Barbaresco's plan is progressing.\n\nHe discovers that Barbaresco and a group of friends, including Valeria's trusted confidante Enzo Spigno, are plotting the murder of Theodore, Valeria's uncle, who is serving Regent of Montferrat until Valeria's brother, the rightful Marquis, reaches majority. Theodore is plotting to keep the throne for himself, and is doing so by corrupting his nephew and rendering him unable to rule. Bellarion continues to investigate the matter, despite Valeria's wishing that he would leave her alone; he discovers that Spigno is a traitor to the group and is in the employ of Theodore, and consequently stabs him. As he escapes, the Guard captures him, and its captain recognizes him as the same companion of da Trino who had escaped a week before. He goes before the local high court, over which the Podestà presides, for the murder of Spigno. He tells the court that Spigno was murdered in a fight in the house at which Bellarion was not present, and claims to be the adoptive son of Facino Cane, a condottiere in Milan, as a delaying tactic.\n\nThe Podestà holds the case for the time being, intending to contact Facino to verify whether Bellarion is truly his adoptive son; meanwhile, Theodore enters his prison cell, believing that he was a traitor to Valeria and loyal to himself, and affords him means to escape, unaware that he did in fact murder Spigno. Bellarion travels thence to Milan.\n\nUpon nearing Milan, he is attacked by dogs commanded by Gian Maria Visconti, the despotic and cruel Duke of Milan and the son of Gian Galeazzo Visconti. He kills one, becoming soaked in dog's blood, and the rest become pacified, unwilling to attack someone who smells like one of them. Gian Maria believes this is some manner of witchcraft and takes Bellarion to Milan to interrogate him, whereupon Facino Cane, who has heard that his supposed adoptive son has arrived, takes possession of him. Bellarion explains his past to Facino, who thinks it highly amusing, and shortly sets about formalizing the adoption.\n\nThe story continues to follow the career of Bellarion, who becomes a true and loyal son to Facino Cane, then pledges loyalty to Cane's widow after Facino dies. There are numerous twists and turns to the plot as Bellarion rises in rank to become an important mercenary captain. He serves Valeria in many ways, and that story takes over the plot.\n"}

Adam and J.T. see Adam's girlfriend Carly talking with the school security guard, Officer Michaels. Carly mentions to Adam that Michaels is interested with and wants to meet Adam. After making plans to meet Carly later, Adam goes to various classes as normal. After one class, Officer Michaels comes and brings Adam to the vice-principal's office. The vice-principal thinks Adam is taking steroids or illegal drugs, a notion started by Adam's high school rival, Ricky Sims. At football practice Ricky revealed he started the rumor Adam was taking drugs. They have a brief fight, and Adam has another seizure. Dr. Aaronson is there and helps take the unconscious Adam home. Adam is later shown lying on an operating table, hooked up to various cables.\n\nThe next morning, Adam wakes up but does not remember the seizure at all, and seems to have forgotten certain information from the past couple of weeks, such as studying for a test that day. When Adam mentions he doesn't remember the seizure to his Dad, his Dad shrugs it off and says not to worry. During school he is called to the nurse's office. The nurse takes Adam's temperature and listens for his heartbeat, but is confused when she hears something strange (it is not revealed what she heard). After school he looks for J.T., and finds Ricky beating him up in an alley behind the school. Adam comes to J.T.'s defense and gets in another fight with Ricky. During the fight, Ricky accidentally shoves a piece of metal through Adam's hand and puts a hole through it. Adam sees the broken wires in his hand and, not sure what he is, has another seizure and passes out. Ricky goes to Officer Michaels and tells him Adam is a robot. Ricky runs off and Michaels, in turn, calls Radcliffe about Adam, revealing Michaels works for Aaronson's former employer Holden Radcliffe.\n\nBack at home, Adam wakes up on an operating table in the dark, and overhears Isaac Aaronson talking with someone, and deciding not to wipe his memory this time. Adam then wakes up in his bed, and thinks it was all a dream. He goes downstairs where his father was waiting for him and he tells Adam the truth: that he is a robot and that all of his memories have been fake. Adam initially believes his \"father\" is lying to him, and says his memories, specifically about him falling off his bike when he was younger and being with his mom when she died, could not be fake. Aaronson shows Adam his blueprints, showing Adam that he was not lying. Confronted with this information, Adam becomes enraged and runs away. Seeing that Aaronson is alone, Michaels captures him and attacks Adam. After being shot but escaping, Adam then goes to J.T.s house, but collapses. J.T. drags Adam in and starts to reset Adam to blank his memory, revealing J.T. knew Adam is a robot. Adam wakes up, quickly stops J.T., and is surprised J.T. knew about him.\n\nAdam and J.T run back to Adam's home, to show that his house has been trashed and his father is missing. Aaronson is shown being interrogated by Michaels. The Holden Radcliffe Corporation is bent on getting their \"stolen property\" (Adam) back. J.T. reveals that before Adam was \"born\", J.T. worked for Aaronson as a lab assistant. One day he came across Adam's robotic body, and since then was forced to keep the truth about Adam a secret. J.T. reveals an external harddrive Aaronson had previously hid, which he thinks might help Adam understand his situation. Adam plugs into the hard drive, but is then attacked by another of Radcliffe's agents. J.T. shocks the agent with a taser Aaronson had made and they escape. T.J says he wasn't sure the taser would work on a \"real\" person offending Adam accidentally. He apologized and says that Adam was not programmed to be his friend and that he is human as he has free will. Adam calls Carly and has them meet them near the school. Carly unknowingly helps Radcliffe agents capture Adam, leading Office Michaels to Adam and J.T. and they are all captured.\n\nAdam and his friends are brought to a building where Adam's father is. Adam is taken away and strapped to a table, where Radcliffe tries to hack into Adam and take control of him, however, he cannot. Adam manages to escape from Radcliffe, along with his father and friends, by tricking them in to thinking he is under their control. During the escape, Adam is nearly destroyed, and has to delay Radcliffe to let his father and friends escape. Dr. Aaronson escapes with Adam's computer core, which sets off a self-destruct sequence. Adam explodes, and Radcliffe and Michaels are killed in the explosion. One year later, Adam is rebuilt, entering a new high school, Edison High School, and starts a new life.\n\nAdam was considered as a \"potential recruit\" for the program, according to \"Civil War: Battle Damage Report\".\n\nMachine Teen is part of the new class of students when the Avengers Academy moves to the former headquarters of the West Coast Avengers. Machine Teen later leaves the Avengers Academy, alongside Rocket Racer.\n\nAs a humanoid robot, Adam has all the basic powers of an android. He has super strength, as seen when he easily rips open a steel door, freeing his friends from their captors. He also has limited durability, with bullets having little effect on him and being able to shrug off other physical attacks. Additionally, he has enhanced agility, as seen when he dodges opponents attacks and early on during the football game when he avoids the opponent players. As a robot, Adam has the ability to remember and easily memorize a lot of information.\n\nIn his appearances in \"Avengers Academy\", it is shown that he is now able to telescopically extend his arms and legs.\n\nDespite these strengths, Adam also has several weaknesses. One weakness is any electromagnetic pulse can disable, or possibly kill, him. This is evidenced when he threatens to kill himself with an electromagnetic device, that his dad had made, in order to stop Radcliffe from hurting his father and friends. Another weakness is there is the possibility Adam can be hacked and reprogrammed. However, his father stated that he heavily encrypted Adam's files, as even Radcliffe was not able to take control of him.\n\nBefore discovering his was a robot, Adam would suffer from seizures, which would cause him to pass out. These seizures were due to his mind not being able to understand why he could perform incredible feats of strength. When his seizures occur, Dr. Aaronson has to reboot him and wipe his memory. Since realizing why he had his abilities, Adam has not had this problem. While Adam is resistance to physical attacks, he can not resist high-powered attacks. While trying to escape Radcliffe, Adam is shot with a high-powered machine gun, which nearly destroys him. Parts of him are blown away and he's left barely able to move.\n\nAdam's chest cavity houses his central computer core, which stores all his information. If the core is removed, his father installed a fail safe which would cause Adam to self-destruct, in order to prevent anyone from recreating him for other purposes. Adam is still able to function even without the data core, but it is unknown for how long, and it is unknown how long the self-destruct sequence is. Once the core is removed, the sequence is irreversible. While this destroys Adam's body, it also kills anyone in the vicinity, with the blast having a wide area of effect.\n\nDuring the House of M event, Adam has several new features. While he is disassembled and experimented on, he is still able to talk and function properly. He is also able to reconnect his body parts with little issue, being able to draw his parts back to him. It is not explained what mechanism allows him to do so. Additionally, Adam can transform his arms into guns.\n\nDuring the House of M event, Adam and his father joined up with A.I.M. after their lab was destroyed in an explosion by reactionary mutants. He gets captured and is for a while experimented on. When the Hulk and A.I.M. attack, Adam helps cause a distraction allowing the Hulk to win and conquer Australia. After this, he is called in by Bruce Banner to help with some paperwork. Adam, along with the rest of A.I.M., is ordered out of the country by the Hulk.\n\n\n"}

It is made by treating lead(II) oxide with acetic acid. Like other lead compounds, it is toxic. Lead acetate is soluble in water and glycerin. With water it forms the trihydrate, Pb(CHCOO)·3HO, a colourless or white efflorescent monoclinic crystalline substance.\n\nThe substance is used as a reagent to make other lead compounds and as a fixative for some dyes. In low concentrations, it is the principal active ingredient in progressive types of hair colouring dyes. Lead(II) acetate is also used as a mordant in textile printing and dyeing, and as a drier in paints and varnishes. It was historically used as a sweetener and for cosmetics.\n\nLead acetate can be made by boiling elemental lead in acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. This method will also work with lead carbonate or lead oxide.\n\nPb(s) + HO(aq) + 2 H(aq) → Pb(aq) + 2 HO(l) <br>\nPb(aq) + 2 CHCOO(aq) → Pb(CHCOO)(aq)\n\nLead(II) acetate can also be made via a single displacement reaction between copper acetate and lead metal:\n\nCu(CHCOO) + Pb → Cu + Pb(CHCOO)\n\nLike other lead(II) salts, lead(II) acetate has a sweet taste, which led to its historical use as a sugar substitute. The ancient Romans, who had few sweeteners besides honey, would boil must (grape juice) in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called \"defrutum\", concentrated again into \"sapa\". This syrup was used to sweeten wine and to sweeten and preserve fruit. It is possible that lead(II) acetate or other lead compounds leaching into the syrup might have caused lead poisoning in those who consumed it. Lead acetate is no longer used in the production of sweeteners because of its recognized toxicity. Modern chemistry can easily detect it, which has almost completely stopped the illegal use that continued decades after legal use as a sweetener was banned.\n\nThe earliest confirmed poisoning by lead acetate was that of Pope Clement II who died in October 1047. A toxicological examination of his remains conducted in the mid-20th century confirmed centuries-old rumors that he had been poisoned with lead sugar. It is not clear if he was assassinated.\n\nIn 1787 painter Albert Christoph Dies swallowed, by accident, approximately of lead acetate. His recovery from this poison was slow and incomplete. He lived with illnesses until his death in 1822.\n\nAlthough the use of lead(II) acetate as a sweetener was already illegal at that time, composer Ludwig van Beethoven may have died of lead poisoning caused by wines adulterated with lead acetate (see also \"Beethoven's liver)\".\n\nIn the 1850s, Mary Seacole applied lead(II) acetate, among other remedies, against an epidemic of cholera in Panama.\n\nIn 1887, 38 hunting horses belonging to Captain William Hollwey Steeds were poisoned in their stables at Clonsilla House, Dublin, Ireland. At least ten of the hunters died. Captain Steeds, an ‘extensive commission agent’, had previously supplied the horses for the Bray and Greystones Coach. It transpired they had been fed a bran mash that had been sweetened with a toxic lead acetate.\n\nLead(II) acetate, as well as white lead, has been used in cosmetics throughout history.\n\nIt is still used in the USA in men's hair colouring products like Grecian Formula. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers this use safe because human testing showed lead did not enter the bloodstream and was not shown to be absorbed. It was, however, banned in cosmetics by Health Canada in 2005 (effective at the end of 2006) based on tests showing possible carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity, and it is also banned in the European Union and has been on the California Proposition 65 warning list as a carcinogen since 1988.\n\nLead(II) acetate solution was a commonly used folk remedy for sore nipples. In modern medicine, for a time, it was used as an astringent, in the form of Goulard's Extract, and it has also been used to treat poison ivy.\n\nLead(II) acetate paper is used to detect the poisonous gas hydrogen sulfide. The gas reacts with lead(II) acetate on the moistened test paper to form a grey precipitate of lead(II) sulfide.\n\nAn aqueous solution of lead(II) acetate is the byproduct of a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar (acetic acid) used in the cleaning and maintenance of stainless steel firearm suppressors (silencers) and compensators. The solution is agitated by the bubbling action of the hydrogen peroxide, and the main reaction is the dissolution of lead deposits within the suppressor by the acetic acid, which forms lead acetate. Because of its high toxicity, this chemical solution must be appropriately disposed by a chemical processing facility or hazardous materials centre. Alternatively, the solution may be reacted with sulfuric acid to precipitate nearly insoluble lead(II) sulfate. The solid may then be removed by mechanical filtration and is safer to dispose of than aqueous lead acetate.\n\nIt was also used in making of slow matches during the Middle Ages. It was made by mixing natural form of lead(II) oxide called litharge and vinegar.\n\nSugar of lead was a recommended agent added to linseed oil during heating to produce \"boiled\" linseed oil, the lead and heat acting to cause the oil to cure faster than raw linseed oil.\n\n\n"}

The program is broadcast each weekday morning from 4:00 to 7 a.m. Eastern Time, immediately preceding NBC's \"Today\". Weekend editions of the program (branded as \"Weekend Today in New York\") also air on Saturdays in two one-hour blocks from 6 to 7 a.m. and 9 to 10 a.m.; and on Sundays in one two-hour block from 6 to 8:00 a.m. and one one-hour block from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. (with \"Weekend Today\" airing in between the two Saturday blocks and \"Sunday Today with Willie Geist\" airing in between the two Sunday blocks).\n\nThe program maintains a general format of news stories, traffic reports and weather forecasts, but also includes sports summaries, and entertainment and feature segments. The local news cut-ins broadcast during \"Today\" (at approximately :26 and :56 minutes past the hour) are also branded as \"Today in New York\". During the weekday edition, the anchors traditionally sign off with the sentence \"The \"Today\" Show is next. That's what happening today in New York.\"\n\nPrior to becoming a full-fledged program, \"Today in New York\" existed as a brief summary of news headlines, weather, and sports, airing on WNBC-TV immediately preceding \"Today\" and usually running between five and 15 minutes in length. Beginning in 1983, with the launch of \"NBC News at Sunrise\", \"Today in New York\" became a half-hour pre-taped interview show which ran at 6:00 a.m., prior to \"Sunrise\" at 6:30. In 1987 \"Today in New York\" returned to a news update format, and aired at 6:45 a.m. following the network business news show \"Before Hours\".\n\nWhen \"Before Hours\" was canceled by NBC in 1988, \"Today in New York\" was expanded to 30 minutes. Gradual expansions of the show's runtime followed: to one hour (6 to 7 a.m.) in 1990; to 90 minutes (starting at 5:30 a.m.) in 1994; to two hours (starting at 5:00 a.m.) by 1999; and to two-and-a-half hours (starting at 4:30 a.m.) in 2010. The program expanded to its current three-hour runtime (starting at 4:00 a.m.) on July 31, 2017.\n\nJane Hanson served as the original anchor of the program. After being removed from the anchor desk of \"Live at Five\" in 1992, Tony Guida briefly co-anchored the program followed by Matt Lauer from 1992 to 1994 and Mary Civiello in 1997. Maurice DuBois followed as a co-anchor until he left for WCBS-TV in 2004; he was replaced by Rob Morrison.\n\nHanson, who remained with the station until November 2006 and later returned to WNBC as host of \"New York Live\", was replaced by Darlene Rodriguez in 2003. After Morrison's departure in June 2008, Michael Gargiulo became co-anchor of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was perhaps best known for his bestselling work \"The Body\" (originally published in 1968 and later renamed \"The Human Body\"), which has sold over 800,000 copies worldwide and tied in with a BBC television series, \"The Human Body\", known in America by the name \"Intimate Universe: The Human Body\". The series aired in 1998 and was presented by Professor Robert Winston.\n\nSmith read zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, became a pilot in the RAF and went on to write as a science correspondent for the \"Daily Telegraph\". He also worked extensively in both television and radio, writing for several natural history programmes.\n\nSmith's first expedition was to Persia, exploring the Qanat underground irrigation tunnels. This expedition was documented in his book \"Blind White Fish in Persia\"; a species of fish that he discovered and is named after him. In 1977 he returned to Iran with a film crew and two cave divers Martyn Farr and Richard Stevenson who explored the cave where he had found the new species of fish.\n\nIn 1962, he led \"The Sunday Telegraph Balloon Safari\" expedition (with Douglas Botting), Alan Root and others, flying a hydrogen balloon from Zanzibar to East Africa, and then across the Ngorongoro crater (documented in \"Throw Out Two Hands\"). The following year he became the first Briton to cross the Alps in a balloon.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Smith was instrumental in securing an exhibit for the Imperial War Museum, London. The \"Jolly Boat\", a small lifeboat launched from the SS \"Anglo Saxon\" on 21 August 1940 after its sinking by the German auxiliary cruiser Widder. It carried the surviving members of the ship's crew west across the Atlantic Ocean for sixty-eight days, before finally landing in Eleuthera. By the time the \"Jolly Boat\" made landfall, only two of the seven survivors of the attack were still alive.\n\nFor the next fifty years, the boat was kept by the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut. Smith, personally interested in the story of the lifeboat, secured its return in 1997, after which it was restored for display in 1998 at the Imperial War Museum, London.\n\nOn 30 January 2011, Smith and a crew of three volunteers (Andrew Bainbridge, David Hildred and John Russell, none younger than 56) departed from La Gomera in the Canary Islands in a custom-built raft, with the intention of crossing the Atlantic Ocean within three months, eventually arriving in Eleuthera. The raft, which was given the name \"An-Tiki\" in reference to the \"Kon-Tiki\" raft used by Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl in his 1947 expedition from South America to the Polynesian islands, was assembled during November and December 2010.\n\nTo find crew mates Smith placed an ad in the Telegraph in 2006, which simply read: \"\"Fancy rafting across the Atlantic? Famous traveller requires 3 crew. Must be OAP. Serious adventurers only\"\" From that ad he recruited, David Hildred, a yacht master and civil engineer, and two experienced seamen Andy Bainbridge and John Russell.\n\nThe raft's superstructure consisted of a small hut within which the crew shared two bunks, while the hull was fashioned from plastic gas pipes which carried either supplies for ballast or air for buoyancy. Its facilities were designed to be modest and it was equipped with a gas stove for cooking and telegraph poles which would act as masts, as well as solar panels, a wind generator and a foot pump which would power its electronic devices, as the crew used computers and digital cameras to communicate with the outside world and document their journey. According to an article Smith wrote for the \"Daily Telegraph\", in its final form the \"An-tiki\" measured approximately by . Its hut is approximately by .\n\nSmith had been interested in crossing the Atlantic by raft as far back as 1952, when he devised a plan to begin somewhere in the Canary Islands and to rely on fresh fish as his source of food. \"I was a student then and I ran out of money,\" he told the \"Telegraph\". \"But the idea has always niggled me.\" The voyage began as a concise advert listed in the \"Telegraph\" in 2006, which simply read: \"Fancy rafting across the Atlantic? Famous traveller requires 3 crew. Must be OAP. Serious adventurers only.\"\n\nFrom his applications, Smith recruited Robin Batchelor, also a professional balloonist, to help design and build the raft. AnTiki's crew consisted of David Hildred, a yacht master and civil engineer, and two experienced seamen Andy Bainbridge and John Russell. The crew set sail with the intention of raising money for the clean water charity WaterAid and completed their journey successfully on the island of St. Maarten in the Caribbean.\n\nSmith then recruited another crew to join him on the final leg of the voyage to Eleuthera – Alison Porteous, Bruno Sellmer, Nigel Gallaher and Leigh Rooney. They departed St. Maarten on 6 April 2012 and 24 days later were washed up on the island of Eleuthera in a storm. The fact that it was the very same beach on which the \"Jolly Boat\" landed is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nSmith continued both travelling and writing well into his later years whilst residing in London, UK. In 2000 he wrote \"The Weather: The Truth About The Health Of Our Planet\" and in 2003 wrote \"The Lost Lady of the Amazon: The Story of Isabela Godin and Her Epic Journey\", detailing the experiences of Jean Godin des Odonais. \"The Old Man and the Sea: A True Story of Crossing the Atlantic by Raft\" was published posthumously in 2015.\n\nSmith died from acute respiratory failure on 7 July 2014, in Oxford, England, aged 88.\n\n\n<ref>The Great Caving Adventure by Martyn Farr oxford Illustrated Press 1984<ref>\n"}
{"id": "1966074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966074", "title": "My Prerogative", "text": "My Prerogative\n\n\"My Prerogative\" is a song by American singer Bobby Brown from his second studio album \"Don't Be Cruel\" (1988). It was released on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin traveled to New York City, since he felt something was \"missing\" from the record. \"My Prerogative\" was written by Brown as a response to the criticism he received for his departure from New Edition. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. \"My Prerogative\" is often considered a new jack swing.\n\nThe song was positively received by critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best R&B Urban Contemporary Single. It was also commercially successful, reaching number one in \"Billboard\"s Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. \"My Prerogative\" also reached top ten positions in many countries, such as Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The music video for the song features Brown performing the song on stage with his band and dancers. The song was also performed at most of his concerts, usually as the last song of the set list. On the February 4, 1989 performance at Madison Square Garden, he was joined on stage by many popular rap artists and producers of the time.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" has been covered and sampled by a number of artists from different genres, including Britney Spears. She released her cover in her first compilation, \"\" (2004). The cover was produced by Bloodshy & Avant and was noted for aptly referring to Spears's relationship with the media at the time. Although the song only appeared in component charts in the United States, Spears's cover surpassed Brown's version in some European countries, peaking at the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway and reaching the top ten in another fourteen countries.\n\nBrown had already completed recording sessions for \"Don't Be Cruel\" in Los Angeles, California, but felt something was missing in the record. He said, \"I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York to come up with it'\". He traveled to New York, met with Teddy Riley - who presented him with the initial beat. \"My Prerogative\" was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with \"The Hour\" on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, \"A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [a solo career]. It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing\". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" is considered a new jack swing anthem, that merges hip hop beats with elements of synthpop and soul. It features a triplet swing in the sixteenth note, as included in many of Riley's productions. Jake Brown said in his book \"Your body's calling me: music, love, sex & money\" (2003), that like most new jack swing songs from the late 1980s, it was composed by \"punchy, street-savvy beats, with sexually energetic melodies and poppy choruses\". The bassline of the track was described by Cam'Ron Davis of \"CMJ New Music Monthly\" as \"truly sinister\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of A minor, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Brown's vocal range spans from the high-note of C to A.\n\nBarry Michael Cooper of \"Spin\" said \"My Prerogative\" \"sounds like gin-drenched, Roaring Twenties swing\". Arion Berger of \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"a grumpy and undeniably adult dance hit\". \"My Prerogative\" was nominated for at the 3th Soul Train Music Awards in the category of Best R&B Urban Contemporary Single by a Male, but lost to Michael Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\". The following year, \"Spin\" listed the song at number 72 on the \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\" list. It ranked at number 98 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the 80's\". The track is often referred to as Brown's signature song.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" debuted on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 during the week of October 29, 1988 at number 61. The following week, it climbed 16 positions to number 45. On January 14, 1989, it peaked at the top position of the chart. The song also peaked at number one in Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and at number seven in Hot Dance Club Songs. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales over 500,000 copies. In Canada, the song debuted on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart at position 98, on the issue dated December 23, 1989. In the United Kingdom, \"My Prerogative\" debuted at number 87 on December 10, 1988. On February 18, 1989, the song peaked at number six and stayed in the position for two weeks. Following the release of the remixes single on October 14, 1995, \"My Prerogative\" re-entered the UK charts at number 17, and stayed on the chart for two weeks. By 17 October 2015, it had sold 275,000 units in the country. Across Europe, the song reached the top ten in Ireland and the Netherlands, and the top 20 in Germany and Sweden. In Australia and New Zealand, the track peaked at number 40 and number three, respectively.\n\nThe music video for \"My Prerogative\" was directed by Alek Keshishian. It begins with Brown driving a car while his musicians start to perform the song on stage in front of a large crowd. Shortly after, he descends to the stage in an elevator, wearing a black jumpsuit and a headset. He dances flanked by two women, one of them playing a keytar.\n\nJ. D. Considine of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote in the review of \"Bobby\" (1992), \"As anyone who saw him swagger through the videos for 'My Prerogative' and 'Every Little Step' can attest, Brown had a phenomenal ability to convey a sense of street toughness that was utterly without malice or menace, making him credible and likable\". The music video was nominated at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Stage Performance in a Video, but lost to the music video of Living Colour's \"Cult of Personality\". It also charted at number nine on \"RPM\" video chart on July 21, 1990.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" was performed during his tour in promotion for \"Don't Be Cruel\" as the last song of the night. Brown usually performed it wearing a black outfit, flanked with two male dancers wearing white clothes. On the February 4, 1989, show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Brown wore a red boxing robe with the words \"King of the Stage\" printed on the back. During the performance, Joseph Simmons of Run-DMC, LL Cool J and Heavy D joined him onstage and freestyle rapped. Eric B., KRS-One, L. A. Reid, Babyface and Teddy Riley also joined him onstage, with the latter performing a keyboard solo. Peter Watrous of \"The New York Times\" commented that, \"The communal scene on stage mirrored the feeling in the audience; everybody seemed aware that this was a generation that had rewritten the rules of pop entertainment, and was justifiably proud of its achievement\". Brown also performed the song at the 1997 Home Again Tour with New Edition, during the second portion of the show in which he performed hits from his solo career. On November 10, 2005, he performed the song for the first time in eight years at a concert at House of Blues in Atlantic City. He wore a white suit and matching hat, and sang it as the last song of the evening. On January 17, 2006, he performed it at a New Edition show in Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal. During the performance, he tore open his orange dress shirt, singing bare-chested with a tie and a fur coat on. Brown performed the song during his 2007 July shows in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2004, Britney Spears recorded a cover of \"My Prerogative\" with Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single \"Toxic\" from her fourth studio album, \"In the Zone\" (2003). Bloodshy & Avant recorded the song at Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded the vocals at Teldex Studios in Berlin, Germany during the European leg of her tour \"The Onyx Hotel Tour\" in 2004. On August 13, 2004, Spears's label Jive Records announced through a press release that she had covered the song and was planning to release it on her first greatest hits compilation, titled \"\". The song was set to premiere on radio stations on September 14, 2004, however, it leaked in the Real Tapemasters Inc.'s mixtape \"The Future of R&B\" on September 10, 2004.\n\nThe song is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is written in the key of B♭ minor and follows the chord progression of Bbm–F–Bbm throughout, making it in the harmonic minor scale. Spears' cover of \"My Prerogative\" is musically different from its original version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music.\n\nAt the beginning of the song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines \"People can take everything away from you / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?\". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.\n\nThe cover received mixed to negative reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the cover \"a useless remake, which seems to exist solely for its video\". Spence D. of IGN said that the lyrics fit perfectly with Spears's relationship with the media at the time. He also added, \"As for her interpretation, it's an interesting chameleonic diversion that comes off like a mash-up between vintage Prince-styled production, Cameo swagger, and Madonna sultriness, but never seems to capture the gloss and glory of any of the aforementioned influences\". Christy Lemire of msnbc.com called it \"utterly unnecessary\". Louis Pattison of the \"New Musical Express\" commented that \"judging by the fuck-you sentiments\" of the cover, Spears liked to play the role of \"[the] pop brat careering off the rails\". Sarah Hepola of Salon.com wrote in an article about contemporary teen idols that the cover \"became an anthem for teen-idol rebellion\". American director Quentin Tarantino included the song in a playlist that inspired him during production of his 2009 film \"Inglourious Basterds\".\n\nIn the United States, \"My Prerogative\" failed to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 but charted in \"Billboard\"s Top 40 Tracks and Mainstream Top 40 at numbers 22 and 34, respectively. \"My Prerogative\" has sold 374,000 paid digital downloads in the United States. On November 15, 2004, the song debuted at the Australian Singles Chart at number seven. It received a gold certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments over 35,000 units. The same week, it debuted at number seventeen in New Zealand. On November 7, 2004, the song debuted at number three in the United Kingdom, during a competitive week of new releases, only surpassed by Eminem's \"Just Lose It\" and Destiny's Child's \"Lose My Breath\". According to Official Charts Company, the song has sold 130,000 copies there. The song also reached success throughout Europe, peaking at number one in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway, number two in Spain and number three in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark and Germany. It also reached top ten positions in Austria, Czech Republic, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\n\nThe music video for \"My Prerogative\" was filmed in August 2004 at The Paramour Mansion in Silver Lake, Los Angeles and was directed by Jake Nava. It premiered on MTV's \"TRL\" on September 16, 2004, and on BET's \"106 & Park\" on January 18, 2005. According to Spears's mother Lynne, the video was \"about capturing gorgeous close-ups and very subtle movement\" since Spears could not do any choreography due to her knee injury at the \"Outrageous\" music video shoot. She also described the video as \"[having] an element of old Hollywood glamour and mystery\".\n\nThe music video begins with Spears driving a Porsche 928 at high speed in the Hollywood Hills. She crashes through a fence and lands into a pool inside a manor where a party is taking place. She emerges from the water and crawls in top of the car to sing the first verse. Spears's brother Bryan makes a cameo in these scenes. After she leaves the pool, she enters the manor and passes couples making out around her. She appears in a stainless steel kitchen, where a maid cuts the straps of her black wet dress. In the next scene, she walks into a study in which her husband at the time, Kevin Federline, is smoking and watching a black-and-white video of Spears on a projection screen. According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV, the clip had the style of pornographic films from the 1940s and 1950s. \"Rolling Stone\" in their article \"Britney Spears: The Complete Video Guide\", compared it to Madonna's performances of her 1984 single \"Like a Virgin\". She then entered a dressing room with mirrors, wearing lingerie, high heels, stockings and a short fur jacket. She proceeds to a bedroom, in which a black dress is laid out on the comforter. She puts on the new dress and the camera cuts to the party outside where people gathered waiting. During the song's bridge, it is revealed that the party is actually Spears's wedding, as she starts walking towards the aisle and Federline waits next to a priest. The video ends with a shot of the black-and-white video and Spears looking into the camera. The black-and-white footage was released as an alternate version of the music video in the 2004 DVD \"\".\n\nEuropean, Australian and Japan CD single \n\n\nUK CD single \n\n\nUK DVD single \n\n\nUK promo CD \n\nUK promo 12\" vinyl \n\n\nU.S. promo CD \n\n\n\"My Prerogative\" was sampled and covered by many artists from different genres. It was sampled in Nice & Smooth's \"O-o-h Child\" (1989), Public Enemy's \"Pollywanacraka\" (1990), Nice & Smooth's \"Hip Hop Junkies\" (1991) and LL Cool J's \"Doin It\" (1995). J.D. Considine of \"Rolling Stone\" noted that the hook of Brown's 1992 single \"Humpin' Around\" from \"Bobby\", \"bears a more than passing resemblance to the synth part from 'My Prerogative'\". According to \"Entertainment Weekly\", American R&B group U.N.V. sampled the melody for their 1993 single \"Something's Goin' On\". Jamaican reggae singer Beenie Man covered \"My Prerogative\" for his 1998 studio album \"Many Moods of Moses\". American singer Rod Michael covered the song for his 2004 studio album, \"The Next Episode\". English rock band Selfish Cunt also covered the song for their 2004 studio album \"No Wicked Heart Shall Prosper\", changing the name to \"Bobby\".\n\nIn July 2007, American basketball player LeBron James covered \"My Prerogative\" at the ESPY Awards, wearing a wig and Hammer pants. \"Vibe\" named the performance one of the \"worst of the worst live performances of the year\". Anoop Desai, contestant of the eight season of \"American Idol\", covered the song for his wildcard round performance. It earned him the last spot in the finals, marking the first time the show ever had thirteen contestants. Desai also performed the song during the American Idols Live! Tour 2009. Graeme McRanor of \"The Vancouver Sun\" said in the concert review that \"My Prerogative\" \"really shouldn't be covered by any artist, ever again\". On July 31, 2009, American hip hop group The Pharcyde covered the song at the All Points West Music & Arts Festival in Jersey City. The song was also featured on the films \"Love & Basketball\" (2000), \"Wild Hogs\" (2007) and \"Sex Drive\" (2008). The song was performed in the 2013 \"Glee\" episode \"Guilty Pleasures\" by Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist).\n\nDuring the premiere episode of \"The Masked Singer\", Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown covered \"My Prerogative\", incognito as a character known as \"the Hippo\". After losing to an unrevealed Peacock character, and subsequently being eliminated from the pool of contestants, Brown was required to reveal his identity.\n\n\n"}

All of the boundaries of Pierce Middle School and most of the boundary of Brownell Middle School coincides with that of GPSHS.\n\nIn 2009, Grosse Pointe South ranked in the top 2% of High Schools-Nationwide.\nBy 2010, Newsweek posted that Grosse Pointe South High School ranked 920 (fifth in Michigan) and Grosse Pointe North High School was 899th (4th in Michigan).\n\nAs of 2010, the school offers 15 varsity sports teams for boys and 18 varsity sports teams for girls. These sports include baseball, basketball, competitive cheer, crew, cross country, field hockey, figure skating, football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, sailing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, synchronized swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. Grosse Pointe South competes in the Macomb Area Conference (MAC), under the regulation of the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA).\n\nThe boys' tennis team won the class A state championship in 1945 and 1946 and tied with Monroe High School in 1947. The girls' tennis team won the state championship every year from 1976 to 1986 (Tying in 1976,1977,1982 and 1985), 2008, 2012, and 2014.\n\nPointe Players is Grosse Pointe South's student theater organization. It is Troupe #49 of the International Thespian Society. It is also among the five oldest clubs at South, as it was started in 1929.\n\nThe group produces one main stage play each Fall. Recent productions have included Daniel J. Sullivan's \"Inspecting Carol\", Christopher Sergel's adaptation of Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", John Van Druten's \"I Remember Mama\", Oscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" and Eugene O'Neill's \"Ah, Wilderness!\"\nIn 2008, the 'Players' performed Moises Kaufman's \"The Laramie Project\", a controversial play about the murder of gay University of Wyoming student, Matthew Shepard.\n\n‘’’The South Sun Devils’’’ is the Solar Car Team, competing since 2013 in the Solar Car Challenge in Dallas, Texas. The team, fundraised, designed, built, and raced their street-legal car on the Dallas Motor Speedway followed by a road test challenge.,\n\nGrosse Pointe High School hosted a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. on March 14, 1968, when 2,700 people gathered in the gymnasium to hear a speech entitled \"The Other America\", just three weeks before his assassination. Dr. King had already visited Detroit and led a march in the city of Detroit where he gave an early version of his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n\nTo honor the 50th anniversary of the event the Grosse Pointe News partnered with the Grosse Pointe Public School System and the Grosse Pointe Board of Realtors in submitting an application for a historic site marker to be placed near the one previously installed on campus. The marker, which was approved by the Michigan Historical Commission on July 27, 2018, was paid for by a grant from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1966084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966084", "title": "Passive infrared sensor", "text": "Passive infrared sensor\n\nA passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications. \n\nPIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved. For that purpose, an active IR sensor is required. \n\nPIR sensors are commonly called simply \"PIR\", or sometimes \"PID\", for \"passive infrared detector\". The term \"passive\" refers to the fact that PIR devices do not radiate energy for detection purposes. They work entirely by detecting infrared radiation (radiant heat) emitted by or reflected from objects.\n\nAll objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit heat energy in the form of radiation. Usually this radiation isn't visible to the human eye because it radiates at infrared wavelengths, but it can be detected by electronic devices designed for such a purpose.\n\nFor a D.C. current, the PIR Sensor works from 3.3v to 5v DC and gives a TTL output which is directly given to a micro-controller or to relay through a transistor. The PIR sensor consists of a pyroelectric sensor and a Fresnel lens. This curved lens concentrates infrared radiation toward a detector’s sensor.\n\nThe sensor output is inverted by the transistor. Collector of the transistor is connected to the input pin forms the latch circuit which is set when PIR output goes high to indicate the presence of a warm body. Output of the latch pin operates the relay driving circuit formed by transistors arranged in emitter follower mode.\n\nA PIR-based motion detector is used to sense movement of people, animals, or other objects. They are commonly used in burglar alarms and automatically-activated lighting systems. \n\nA PIR sensor can detect changes in the amount of infrared radiation impinging upon it, which varies depending on the temperature and surface characteristics of the objects in front of the sensor. When an object, such as a person, passes in front of the background, such as a wall, the temperature at that point in the sensor's field of view will rise from room temperature to body temperature, and then back again. The sensor converts the resulting change in the incoming infrared radiation into a change in the output voltage, and this triggers the detection. Objects of similar temperature but different surface characteristics may also have a different infrared emission pattern, and thus moving them with respect to the background may trigger the detector as well.\n\nPIRs come in many configurations for a wide variety of applications. The most common models have numerous Fresnel lenses or mirror segments, an effective range of about 10 meters (30 feet), and a field of view less than 180. Models with wider fields of view, including 360°, are available, typically designed to mount on a ceiling. Some larger PIRs are made with single segment mirrors and can sense changes in infrared energy over 30 meters (100 feet) from the PIR. There are also PIRs designed with reversible orientation mirrors which allow either broad coverage (110° wide) or very narrow \"curtain\" coverage, or with individually selectable segments to \"shape\" the coverage.\n\nPairs of sensor elements may be wired as opposite inputs to a differential amplifier. In such a configuration, the PIR measurements cancel each other so that the average temperature of the field of view is removed from the electrical signal; an increase of IR energy across the entire sensor is self-cancelling and will not trigger the device. This allows the device to resist false indications of change in the event of being exposed to brief flashes of light or field-wide illumination. (Continuous high energy exposure may still be able to saturate the sensor materials and render the sensor unable to register further information.) At the same time, this differential arrangement minimizes common-mode interference, allowing the device to resist triggering due to nearby electric fields. However, a differential pair of sensors cannot measure temperature in this configuration, and therefore is only useful for motion detection.\n\nWhen a PIR sensor is configured in a differential mode, it specifically becomes applicable as a motion detector device. In this mode when a movement is detected within the \"line of sight\" of the sensor, a pair of complementary pulses are processed at the output pin of the sensor. In order to implement this output signal for a practical triggering of a load such as a relay or a data logger, or an alarm, the differential signal is rectified using a bridge rectifier and fed to a transistorized relay driver circuit. The contacts of this relay close and open in response to the signals from the PIR, activating the attached load across its contacts, acknowledging the detection of a person within the predetermined restricted area.\n\nThe PIR sensor is typically mounted on a printed circuit board containing the necessary electronics required to interpret the signals from the sensor itself. The complete assembly is usually contained within a housing, mounted in a location where the sensor can cover the area to be monitored.\n\nDifferent mechanisms can be used to focus the distant infrared energy onto the sensor surface.\n\nThe plastic window covering may have multiple facets molded into it, to focus the infrared energy onto the sensor. Each individual facet is a Fresnel lens.\nSome PIRs are manufactured with internal, segmented parabolic mirrors to focus the infrared energy. Where mirrors are used, the plastic window cover generally has no Fresnel lenses molded into it.\nAs a result of the focussing, the detector view is actually a beam pattern. Under certain angles (zones), the PIR sensor receives almost no radiation energy and under other angles the PIR receives concentrated amounts of infrared energy. This separation helps the motion detector to discriminate between field-wide illumination and moving objects.\n\nWhen a person walks from one angle (beam) to another, the detector will only intermittently see the moving person. This results in a rapidly changing sensor signal which is used by the electronics to trigger an alarm or to turn on lighting. A slowly changing signal will be ignored by the electronics.\n\nThe number, shape, distribution and sensitivity of these zones are determined by the lens and/or mirror. Manufacturers do their best to create the optimal sensitivity beam pattern for each application.\n\nWhen used as part of a lighting system, the electronics in the PIR typically control an integral relay capable of switching mains voltage. This means the PIR can be set up to turn on lights that are connected to the PIR when movement is detected. This is most commonly used in outdoor scenarios either to deter criminals (security lighting) or for practical uses like the front door light turning on so you can find your keys in the dark.\n\nAdditional uses can be in public toilets, walk-in pantries, hallways or anywhere that automatic control of lights is useful. This can provide energy savings as the lights are only turned on when they are needed and there is no reliance on users remembering to turn the lights off when they leave the area.\n\nWhen used as part of a security system, the electronics in the PIR typically control a small relay. This relay completes the circuit across a pair of electrical contacts connected to a detection input zone of the burglar alarm control panel. The system is usually designed such that if no motion is being detected, the relay contact is closed—a 'normally closed' (NC) relay. If motion is detected, the relay will open the circuit, triggering the alarm; or, if a wire is disconnected, the alarm will also operate.\n\nManufacturers recommend careful placement of their products to prevent false alarms (i.e., any detection not caused by an intruder).\n\nThey suggest mounting the PIRs in such a way that the PIR cannot \"see\" out of a window. Although the wavelength of infrared radiation to which the chips are sensitive does not penetrate glass very well, a strong infrared source (such as from a vehicle headlight or sunlight) can overload the sensor and cause a false alarm. A person moving on the other side of the glass would not be \"seen\" by the PID. That may be good for a window facing a public sidewalk, or bad for a window in an interior partition.\n\nIt is also recommended that the PIR not be placed in such a position that an HVAC vent would blow hot or cold air onto the surface of the plastic which covers the housing's window. Although air has very low emissivity (emits very small amounts of infrared energy), the air blowing on the plastic window cover could change the plastic's temperature enough to trigger a false alarm.\n\nSensors are also often designed to \"ignore\" domestic pets, such as dogs or cats, by setting a higher sensitivity threshold, or by ensuring that the floor of the room remains out of focus.\n\nSince PIR sensors have ranges of up to 10 meters (30 feet), a single detector placed near the entrance is typically all that is necessary for rooms with only a single entrance. PIR-based security systems are also viable in outdoor security and motion-sensitive lighting; one advantage is their low power draw, which allows them to be solar-powered.\n\nDesigns have been implemented in which a PIR circuit measures the temperature of a remote object. In such a circuit, a non-differential PIR output is used. The output signal is evaluated according to a calibration for the IR spectrum of a specific type of matter to be observed. By this means, relatively accurate and precise temperature measurements may be obtained remotely. Without calibration to the type of material being observed, a PIR thermometer device is able to measure changes in IR emission which correspond directly to temperature changes, but the actual temperature values cannot be calculated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966095", "title": "Voluntary Human Extinction Movement", "text": "Voluntary Human Extinction Movement\n\nThe Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an environmental movement that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.\n\nVHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became involved in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, while endorsing the logic of reducing the rate of human reproduction. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.\n\nThe Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight, a high school substitute teacher living in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in the environmental movement as a college student in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.\n\nIn 1991, Knight began publishing VHEMT's newsletter, known as \"These Exit Times\". In the newsletter, he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating. VHEMT has also published cartoons, including a comic strip titled \"Bonobo Baby\", featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a bonobo. In 1996, Knight created a website for VHEMT; it was available in 11 languages by 2010. VHEMT's logo features the letter \"V\" (for voluntary) and a picture of the Earth with north at the bottom.\n\nVHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization, and does not compile a list of members. Daniel Metz of Willamette University stated in 1995 that VHEMT's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers. Six years later, Fox News said the list had only 230 subscribers. Knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement; and that this includes \"millions of people\".\n\nKnight serves as the spokesman for VHEMT. He attends environmental conferences and events, where he publicizes information about population growth. VHEMT's message has, however, primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets, rather than events and its newsletter. VHEMT sells buttons and T-shirts, as well as bumper stickers that read \"Thank you for not breeding\".\n\nIn 2018, a supporter of the movement appeared on the popular YouTube channel LAHWF in a video called, \"Chatting with a Supporter of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement\".\n\nKnight argues that the human population is far greater than the Earth can handle, and that the best thing for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing. He says that humans are \"incompatible with the biosphere\" and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms). According to Knight, the vast majority of human societies have not lived sustainable lifestyles, and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms. Voluntary human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the extinction of other species; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population.\n\nJames Ormrod, a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal \"Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society\", notes that the \"most fundamental belief\" of VHEMT is that \"human beings should stop reproducing\", and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction. Knight, however, believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly, they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves. Residents of First World countries bear the most responsibility to change, according to Knight, as they consume the largest proportion of resources.\n\nKnight believes that Earth's non-human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments, such as art: \"The plays of Shakespeare and the work of Einstein can't hold a candle to a tiger\". He argues that species higher in the food chain are less important than lower species. His ideology is drawn in part from deep ecology, and he sometimes refers to the Earth as Gaia. He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals. The potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit.\n\nKnight sees abstinence from reproduction as an altruistic choice – a way to prevent involuntary human suffering – and cites the deaths of children from preventable causes as an example of needless suffering. Knight claims that non-reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to the Garden of Eden, and maintains that the last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment. Other benefits of ceasing human reproduction that he cites include the end of abortion, war, and starvation. Knight argues that \"procreation today is de facto child abuse\". He maintains that the standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues. He speculates that if people ceased to reproduce, they would use their energy for other pursuits, and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children.\n\nVHEMT rejects government-mandated human population control programs in favor of voluntary population reduction, supporting only the use of birth control and willpower to prevent pregnancies. Knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower the human population, citing the fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars, famines, and viruses. Though their newsletter's name recalls the suicide manual \"Final Exit\", the idea of mass suicide is rejected, and they have adopted the slogan \"May we live long and die out\". A 1995 survey of VHEMT members found that a majority of them felt a strong moral obligation to protect the Earth, distrusted the ability of political processes to prevent harm to the environment, and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause. VHEMT members who strongly believed that \"Civilization [is] headed for collapse\" were most likely to embrace these views. However, VHEMT does not take any overt political stances.\n\nVHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, a group that argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population to care for the Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.\n\nKnight states his group's ideology runs counter to contemporary society's natalism. He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control. He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option.\n\nReception of Knight's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed. Writing in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Gregory Dicum states that there is an \"undeniable logic\" to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded. Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in \"The Independent\", noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive. At \"The Guardian\"s website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as \"in many ways laudable\", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of enculturation.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained. Ormrod claims that Knight \"arguably abandons deep ecology in favour of straightforward misanthropy\". He notes that Knight's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on \"benefits accruing to humans\". Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter-intuitive, arguing that it borrows the language of \"late-modern consumer societies\". He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology. \"The Economist\" characterizes Knight's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as \"Malthusian bosh\". The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction. Sociologist Frank Furedi also deems VHEMT to be a Malthusian group, classifying them as a type of environmental organization that \"[thinks] the worst about the human species\". Writing in \"Spiked\", Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity, rather than \"anti-human\".\n\nBrian Bethune writes in \"Maclean's\" that Knight's logic is \"as absurd as it's unassailable\". However, he doubts Knight's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a \"collective loss of the will to live\" would prevail. In response to Knight's platform, journalist Sheldon Richman argues that humans are \"active agents\" and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth. Alan Weisman, author of \"The World Without Us\", suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction.\n\nKatharine Mieszkowski of Salon.com recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing \"probing questions\" about their childlessness. Writing in the \"Journal for Critical Animal Studies\", Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of \"queer oppositional politics\" because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of \"civil order\", as Lee Edelman suggested that queer theory should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the death drive rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past.\n\nAlthough Knight's organization has been featured in a book titled \"Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief\", \"The Guardian\" journalist Oliver Burkeman notes that in a phone conversation Knight seems \"rather sane and self-deprecating\". Weisman echoes this sentiment, characterizing Knight as \"thoughtful, soft-spoken, articulate, and quite serious\". Philosophers Steven Best and Douglas Kellner view VHEMT's stance as extreme, but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in \"modern humanism\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also chair of the Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth, a fascist youth organisation in the protectorate.\n\nIn World War I, Moravec served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, but following capture by the Russians he changed sides to join Russian-backed Serbian forces and then the Czechoslovak Legion, which went on to fight on the side of the White Army in the Russian Civil War. During the interwar period he commanded an infantry battalion in the Czechoslovak Army. As a proponent of democracy during the 1930s, Moravec was outspoken in his warnings about the expansionist plans of Germany under Adolf Hitler and appealed for armed action rather than capitulation to German demands for the Sudetenland. In the aftermath of the German occupation of the rump Czechoslovakia, he became an enthusiastic collaborator, realigning his political worldview towards fascism. He committed suicide in the final days of World War II.\n\nUnlike some other officials of the short-lived protectorate government, whose reputations were rehabilitated in whole or in part after the war, Moravec's good reputation did not survive his tenure in office and he has been widely derided as a \"Czech Quisling\".\n\nEmanual Moravec was born in Prague, the son of a modest merchant family originally from Kutná Hora. He graduated from a vocational school and found employment as a clerk at a Prague company. At the outbreak of World War I, Moravec was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and dispatched with his unit to the Carpathian Front.\n\nMoravec was captured by the Imperial Russian Army in 1915 and held at a prisoner-of-war camp in Samarkand. He was subsequently paroled and given command of a machine-gun platoon in the First Serbian Volunteer Division; a unit consisting of former prisoners of war, including Serbs and other Slavs from the countries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, fighting on the Russian side. In September 1916, following fierce action against Bulgarian forces along the Dobrudzha Front, Moravec was hospitalized with shell shock. Upon his release, he joined the Czechoslovak Legion, falsely claiming to hold an engineering degree to receive an officer's commission.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Legion, a volunteer unit composed of diaspora Czechs and Slovaks as well as deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army, had been formed in 1917 to support the Allies; it later became involved in the Russian Civil War, fighting on the side of the White Russians. Over the next two years, Moravec saw combat with the Legion in Russia.\n\nMoravec returned to a newly independent Czechoslovakia at the end of World War I with the legionary rank of captain. He was accepted into Prague's War School and, upon graduation, commissioned as a major in the Czechoslovak Army. He ultimately came to command the 1st Field Battalion of the 21st Infantry Regiment in Znojmo. Simultaneous with his military career, Moravec contributed to newspapers and magazines, including \"Lidové noviny\", on political and military matters. Writing under the pen name Stanislav Yester, he won the Baťa Prize for Journalism.\n\nIn 1931 Moravec was appointed an instructor at the War School and promoted to colonel. In his writings, Moravec had become increasingly emphatic about the growing ambitions of Nazi Germany. He called for Czechoslovakia to form an alliance with Poland and Italy against what he saw as a rising German threat. Moravec came to be seen as one of Czechoslovakia's leading geopolitical strategists and caught the attention of President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Moravec wrote the preface to a printed edition of one of Masaryk's addresses to the Czechoslovak Army. In it, he signaled his support for the creation of the democratic state of Czechoslovakia that had come out of World War I, as well as his personal loyalty to Masaryk:\n\nWhen Masaryk died in 1935, Moravec served as one of the pallbearers at his funeral. In 1938 Moravec warned that \"if Czechoslovakia should fall, France would find herself politically on the European periphery\". Moravec argued that the head of the Danube Basin was guarded by what he described as the \"fortress of Bohemia\" – the land barrier that marked the natural border between eastern and western Europe. If a state were to take Czechoslovakia it would, therefore, control the head of the Danube basin and be free to strike against either France or Poland with ease. Although Moravec was concerned with German political and military aims he generally rejected some of the more extreme aspects of anti-German thought, taking a cautiously receptive approach to Emanuel Rádl's thesis which posited the existence of an irrational Czech racism towards Germans.\n\nIn 1938 German demands for the Sudetenland came to a head. In September, General Jan Syrový, inspector-general of the Czechoslovak Army, was installed by President Edvard Beneš as prime minister. In response to the German ultimatum, Syrový declared that \"further concessions from our side are no longer possible\"; 42 Czechoslovak divisions were mobilized in preparation for an expected German invasion. By the end of September, with Czechoslovakia abandoned by France and Britain, and territorial demands piled on from Poland, Beneš backtracked on Czechoslovakia's refusal to accept further German requests.\n\nAt this time, as well as holding his army post, Moravec was serving as a member of the Committee for the Defense of the Republic, a nationalist pressure group led by the son of the former Czechoslovak finance minister Alois Rašín. In that capacity he sought an audience with Beneš during the last week of September, on the eve of the Munich ratification. During a two-hour confrontation with Beneš, Moravec pleaded with the president to declare war against Germany, and not capitulate to German demands. His pleas went unheeded.\n\nThe Munich Agreement left Moravec disillusioned with both Western democracies and Beneš' diplomatic competence. According to Moravec, \"apostles without courage\" had led Czechoslovakia to capitulation. He expressed anger at the government's evocation of national ideals in its announcement of the agreement, declaring that a state unwilling to defend its ideals should not boast of them in the same way \"a whore has no right to boast of her honor\". As a further expression of his contempt for the government, he mockingly requested leave to join the army of El Salvador.\n\nDuring the short-lived Second Czechoslovak Republic, with Prague actively seeking to appease Germany to avoid further territorial losses, Moravec was forced to quit teaching at the military academy. Moreover, he found himself prohibited by the government from writing for newspapers due to concerns that the incendiary, anti-German nature of his editorials would be unduly provocative.\n\nOn 16 March 1939, Germany occupied the rump Czechoslovak state and the German-controlled Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was declared. According to František Moravec, Emanuel Moravec attempted to leave the Czech lands prior to the German arrival and join the military cadre being sent abroad. His offer of service was rejected. Moravec was particularly concerned that his earlier denunciations of Germany, and his reputation as a strident anti-German polemicist, might make him a target of the new regime. He was surprised, therefore, when the new German authorities informed him he could resume writing books and newspaper columns. Moravec returned to writing with gusto and a reoriented editorial line, declaring \"our nation could have died in war [with Germany]. Now the whole nation will die of fright and fear\".\n\nWriting in \"V úloze mouřenína – Československá tragedie 1938\", the most popular of his works, Moravec sought to more fully reconcile his support for the Germans with his earlier calls for resistance. He indicted Beneš and the intelligentsia for Czechoslovakia's defeat and declared it was the unwillingness of the elite to confront Germany militarily that demonstrated democracy's moral decay, thereby ultimately justifying its termination:\n\nIn 1941 Moravec helped found the Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth, a fascist youth group, and served as its chairman. The following year, Reinhard Heydrich who, in his role as the Berlin-appointed Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia held penultimate day-to-day authority in the protectorate, compelled President Emil Hácha to appoint Moravec as the protectorate's education minister. Unlike other protectorate ministries, the education ministry under Moravec was given a measure of independence and not required to report to an overseer in the office of the Reich Protector. As with all protectorate ministers, Moravec's mandate to hold office was at the pleasure of the Reich Protector, as set-out in the 16 March 1939 decree of the German government.\n\nBy the time Moravec was given authority for the education ministry, Czech universities had been closed, school textbooks revised, and more than 1,000 student leaders deported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\n\nIn his new post as minister of education, Moravec instituted the study of German as a compulsory subject in schools, explaining that it would become a \"lingua franca\" of Europe: \"[e]very Czech who desires to excel in the future must acquire the German language so that work opportunities in all fields are open to them not only in the Reich, but also in Europe and the whole world ... learn German in order that the Czechs' good reputation can spread way beyond the frontiers of Bohemia and Moravia\". He also promoted the idea of Czech culture as an historic component of Germanic culture. The Czech Women's Center, originally founded during the Second Republic as a group of professional women seeking greater gender equality, operated under Moravec's auspices. It was at his suggestion that it became a leading advocate for nutritional education.\n\nMoravec did not limit himself to educational questions. In 1943 he advanced a proposal to deploy the Army of the Protectorate to the Eastern Front in support of German operations. Hácha discussed the proposal with Reich Minister for Bohemia and Moravia Karl Hermann Frank who ultimately decided not to forward it to Adolf Hitler.\n\nMoravec reportedly offered the noted Czech journalist Ferdinand Peroutka release from Buchenwald concentration camp in exchange for accepting a position writing for the newspaper \"Lidové noviny\", an offer Peroutka declined.\n\nDuring his tenure as education minister, Moravec adopted an anti-Semitic worldview that largely mirrored that of the Nazi Party. It positioned Germany as fighting a war to save humanity from Judaism. Moravec publicly blamed Jews for pre-war tensions between the former Czechoslovakia and Germany. He claimed that \"Jewish capitalist interests hitched themselves to Anglo-French strategic interests and, entirely artificially and cunningly, escalated Czech hatred of the German nation to a state of unbounded fury.\" In (\"Facts and Errors\") Moravec declared that the annexation of the Czech lands to Germany would benefit Czechs \"because the Jews have been excluded from the German nation, the agents of capitalism have been rendered powerless in Germany\".\n\nIn the winter of 1939–40, the Czechoslovak resistance group known as the Three Kings attempted to kill Moravec with a letter bomb. The Czechoslovak government-in-exile also considered targeting Moravec for assassination, but decided to go after Heydrich instead in what became known as Operation Anthropoid. Following Heydrich's death, Moravec was a keynote speaker at several mass rallies throughout the Protectorate. These were intended to demonstrate the opposition of ordinary Czechs to Heydrich's killing.\n\nDuring the Prague Uprising of May 1945, Moravec attempted to drive to a radio station under German control in the hope of broadcasting an appeal for calm. When the vehicle he was traveling in ran out of fuel Moravec dismounted and shot himself in the head with a pistol, presumably to avoid capture. He died four days before the liberation of Prague.\n\nMoravec was a master Mason, a fact that earned him contempt from some in the pre-Protectorate Czech fascist community such as the \"Vlajka\".\n\nBoth Moravec and his private secretary, Franz Stuchlik, were keen rock collectors. After Moravec's death, his collection was confiscated by the Czechoslovak state and donated to the National Museum. As of 2015, 107 mineral samples from Moravec's private collection were still held by the museum.\n\nMoravec was married three times. His first wife, Helena Georgijevna Beka, whom he met while a prisoner of war in Samarkand, was a close relative of the prominent Bolshevik Alexei Rykov. With her he had two sons, Igor and Yuri. In 1932 he was divorced and, in April that year, married Pavla Szondy, who gave birth to Moravec's third son, Pavel. This marriage also ended in separation, Moravec and Szondy divorcing in 1938. In 1942 Moravec married Jolana Emmerová, his housemaid, who was only sixteen when their relationship caused the end of his previous marriage.\n\nIgor fought on the Eastern Front as a volunteer with the 3rd SS Panzer Division \"Totenkopf\". His younger brother, Yuri, served in the Wehrmacht's 137th Infantry Division and unlike Igor was privately critical of his father's political views. While serving in France, Yuri was caught drunk on guard duty and sentenced to six months imprisonment and a one grade demotion. At the request of Emanuel Moravec, Frank personally appealed to OKW operations chief Alfred Jodl in the matter and the younger Moravec's sentence was quashed.\n\nPavel was sent to school in Salzburg after the establishment of the Protectorate and died in an air raid in 1944. Igor was arrested and executed by hanging at the end of the war on charges of murder and treason. Yuri was arrested and sentenced to a prison term at the end of the war and upon release emigrated to West Germany.\n\nDenounced by the Allies and the Czech government-in-exile during World War II as a \"Czech Quisling\", Moravec has been described by John Laughland as \"an enthusiastic collaborator\" with Nazi Germany. This contrasts with other protectorate-era officials like Hácha, whom Laughland calls \"a tragic figure\", or Jaroslav Eminger, who was later completely exonerated for his service in the Protectorate government. During the 2006 presentation of the Gratias Agit Award, given annually by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs to recognize those who promote the Czech Republic, foreign minister Cyril Svoboda declared that \"... we are also a country of those who have deformed our good name, people [such] as Emanuel Moravec, Klement Gottwald\".\n\nCzech historian Jiří Pernes has argued that had Moravec died before March 1939 he would have been remembered as a well-regarded Bohemian patriot; his pre-war record was sufficiently distinguished to earn him a place in history.\n\nIn 1997 Pernes published a biography of Moravec. He was later criticized for the volume which, it was alleged, was heavily plagiarized from a doctoral dissertation on Moravec's life written by Josef Vytlačil.\n\nIn 2013, Daniel Landa portrayed Moravec in an episode of the Czech historical drama television series \"\" (\"Czech Century\"), titled \"Den po Mnichovu (1938)\" (\"The Day after Mnichov\"). The episode centres on Moravec' fierce opposition to president Beneš' capitulation to the invading German forces, ending with their face-to-face discussion. A mid-credits scene then reveals Moravec' later conversion to German fascism. The episode suggests an ambivalence between genuine and pathological national pride, also by casting Landa, himself a known and controversial nationalist.\n\n\n\n"}

Glebova had previously been crowned Miss Universe Canada 2005.\n\nGlebova was born in Tuapse, Russia to parents Vladimir Slezin and Anna Glebova. While in Russia, Vladimir worked as a radio communications specialist in the merchant marine industry, while Anna was a high school teacher. Glebova grew up as an only child. As a child, Glebova studied classical piano and competed in rhythmic gymnastics. At age 13, Glebova and her family left Russia and settled in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After arriving in Canada, her parents found employment as software specialists.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Glebova worked as a professional model in Toronto and received a Bachelor of Commerce in information technology management and marketing from Ryerson University. Prior to competing in pageantry, Glebova worked as a motivational speaker for elementary and high school students.\n\nIn 2004, Glebova began her pageantry career while competing in Miss Universe Canada 2004, where she placed as the third runner-up behind eventual winner Venessa Fisher. Glebova returned the following year and won the Miss Universe Canada 2005 title.\n\nAs Miss Universe Canada 2005, Glebova earned the right to represent Canada in the Miss Universe 2005 pageant, to be held in Bangkok, Thailand. Glebova became the fourth Canadian in ten years to advance to the semi-finals, eventually advancing to the top five along with Cynthia Olavarria of Puerto Rico, Laura Elizondo of Mexico, Renata Sone of Dominican Republic, and Monica Spear of Venezuela. Throughout the contest, Glebova gave a traditional Thai greeting known as a \"Wai\" on every appearance which helped her win over Thai audiences and judges. At the conclusion of the pageant, Glebova was crowned Miss Universe 2005 by outgoing titleholder Jennifer Hawkins of Australia. Glebova's win was Canada's second after Karen Dianne Baldwin had been crowned Miss Universe 1982. \n\nAs Miss Universe, Glebova traveled extensively and immersed herself in a campaign to increase awareness of HIV and AIDS, the ongoing platform of the Miss Universe titleholder. She attended the G8 Summit in New York City on 11 August 2005, which reflected on ending poverty in underdeveloped regions, and ending gang activity and drug cartels in Colombia. In November, Glebova attended a special Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, India, and was on a week-long tour of several Indian cities on an AIDS Awareness Program. In December, she attended the national pageants of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before going back to Thailand to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 2004 tsunami tragedy.\n\nDuring Glebova's official homecoming to her hometown of Toronto, the Miss Universe was formally offered an apology by the city's mayor David Miller after she was barred from attending a \"Tastes of Thailand\" festival while wearing her sash and tiara nor being introduced as a beauty titleholder. A 1990 bylaw, which prevents sexual stereotyping of women in public events, was strictly enforced and largely criticized by Miller and Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart. Shugart called the episode an \"insult\" to not only Glebova, but to the Thai government who named her an \"honorary tourism ambassador\". According to Shugart, this was the first time in Miss Universe's history that a titleholder was uninvited from a public event. The same bylaw was once invoked to bar Barenaked Ladies from a public concert at Nathan Phillips Square due to their name.\n\nDuring her reign, Glebova traveled to Africa in July to attend an AIDS Educational Tour with the Global Health Council, Malaysia in late September, the Bahamas and St. Martin. In late March 2006, Glebova visited Russia for the first time since leaving the country in her pre-teens. She participated in an HIV-AIDS Awareness campaign in Moscow and attended a Russian fashion show as a special guest. She also made numerous trips to Thailand, where she commemorated the anniversary of the tsunami and Canada, her home nation.\n\nShe also attended the national pageants of Ukraine in mid October, Puerto Rico in November, Dominican Republic in December, Czech Republic in February, Thailand and Nicaragua in March, Brazil in April. She also crowned Alice Panikian as her Miss Universe Canada successor the night of March 21, 2006. Alice finished 6th in Miss Universe.\n\nGlebova was supposed to travel to Indonesia to crown Miss Indonesia Universe 2006 in late July, but because of Canada's travel ban to the Southeast Asian country, Glebova was officially replaced with Puerto Rico's Cynthia Olavarria, the First Runner-Up of Miss Universe 2005. Since the Miss Indonesia pageant's revival in 2000, this was the first time in which Miss Universe was unable to attend the coronation.\n\nOn July 23, 2006, Glebova crowned Zuleyka Rivera Mendoza of Puerto Rico as her successor in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter finishing her reign as Miss Universe, Glebova continued appearing as a brand ambassador and in public roles. In May 2006, it was announced that Glebova, along with golfer Vijay Singh and pro tennis player Paradorn Srichaphan, would become a brand ambassador for Thailand-based beer brewers Singha Corp. owners of Boon Rawd Brewery. Glebova completed her 1-year contract with Singha in July 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Glebova joined \"The Amazing Race Asia 3\" and she partnered with Pailin Rungratanasunthorn. They represented Thailand and came in 8th place. \n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that Glebova will compete in reality TV show \"Dancing with the Stars Thailand\".\nThe first episode was aired on Channel 7 (Thailand) on January 8, 2013, at 10:30pm \n\nIn May 2012, Glebova and French company Bel Perfumes based in Thailand released Glebova's first fragrance, \"Beauty Icon\".\n\nGlebova also serves as an ambassador for Soi Dog Foundation, a non-profit organization aiding homeless street animals in Thailand.\n\nIn June 2015, Glebova became an Ambassador for Year of the Gibbon for the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group - Section on Small Apes, to raise awareness for gibbon conservation. Glebova has a passion for wildlife conservation and recently launched a public awareness campaign about the impact of photo-prop tourism on gibbons Year of the Gibbon.\n\nIn 2018, Glebova partnered with a California attorney and entrepreneur Dr. Patama Mokaves Dumas to start a program for high schools and universities called Empowered. The program's aim is to develop confidence and positive thinking of young people so they can happily achieve their life goals. They are teaching a course titled “Empowered YOU” at Bangkok University since 2018.\n\nIn 2006, Glebova began dating Thai professional tennis player Paradorn Srichaphan, whom she met at the 2006 Thailand Open. They became engaged the following year, and married later in 2007 in Bangkok. The couple split up in early 2011.\n\nGlebova married Panamanian entrepreneur and Mister Panamá 2001 Dean Kelly in 2016.

It has 163 members, representing districts with an average size of 37,000 residents. House members are elected for two-year terms during general elections held in even-numbered years.\n\nIn 1992 Missouri approved a constitutional amendment providing term limits (previously there were no limits). No Representative may serve more than eight years in the House. Each candidate for the office must be at least twenty-four years old, a registered qualified voter in the state for at least two years, and a resident of his or her district for at least one year.\n\nMissouri's house is the fourth largest in the United States although the state ranks 18th in population. Legislation was introduced in 2011 to cut its size to 103 in 2020. Larger legislatures in the United States are New Hampshire (400), Pennsylvania (203) and Georgia (180).\n\n\nThese are the yearly recurring committees that hold hearings on legislation filed by Representatives. Once filed, legislation is assigned to one of the following committees by the Missouri Speaker of the House. Legislation is typically assigned to the committee whose province envelopes the subject matter of the bill. However, there are frequently multiple relevant committees to which a bill can be assigned, and it is at the Speaker's discretion to choose which committee receives the bill. Politics can also play a part, as the Speaker may assign a bill he or she wants to fail to a committee with an unfriendly chair or membership, or may select a more friendly committee if he or she wishes the bill to pass.\n\nThe partisan makeup of each committee is intended to reflect as closely as possible the partisan makeup of the entire House. Each Party caucus selects which of its members will serve on the Standing Committees, and the Chair of each committee is chosen by the Speaker of the House.\n\nTradition in the Missouri General Assembly is that all appropriations bills initiate in the Missouri House rather than the Senate. So each year, the Chair of the House Budget Committee files legislation establishing the spending plan for the state of Missouri. This plan, which in 2007 exceeded $20 billion, may differ greatly from the Governor's budget recommendations, issued at the State of the State address given in late January.\n\nThe budget legislation is assigned to the House Budget Committee, which then assigns each bill to its respective subcommittee. After the subcommittee makes its recommendations, the full Budget Committee runs through the entire appropriations package, makes its desired changes, and sends the bill to the full House for consideration.\n\nJoint Committees contain members from both the Missouri House and Senate. These committees may be permanent and study ongoing issues, or may be temporary and intended to come up with suggested legislation to address a one-time issue. The Chair of these committees typically alternates annually between a Representative and a Senator to prevent unfairness to one chamber.\n\nJoint Committee List\n\n\nIn 1992 Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment placing term limits on the Missouri House of Representatives. A Representative can serve no more than four two-year terms in the house.

In 1988 he became a Fellow of CERN, where he worked on the CPLEAR experiment studying the subtle CP-violation of kaon particles. After a year he became a \"Senior Fellow\" and head of the particle identification subdetector. In November 1990, Fuglesang obtained a position at the Manne Siegbahn Institute of Physics, Stockholm, but remained stationed at CERN for another year working towards the new Large Hadron Collider project. Since 1990, when stationed in Sweden, Fuglesang taught mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology.\n\nIn May 1992, Fuglesang was selected to join the European Astronaut Corps of the European Space Agency (ESA) based at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany. In 1992 he attended an introductory training programme at EAC and a four-week training program at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (TsPK) in Star City, Russia, with a view to future ESA–Russian collaboration on the Mir Space Station. In July 1993, he completed the basic astronaut training course at EAC.\n\nIn May 1993, Fuglesang and fellow ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter were selected for the Euromir 95 mission and commenced training at TsPK (Moscow) in preparation for their onboard engineer tasks, extra-vehicular activities (spacewalks) and operation of the Soyuz spacecraft. The Euromir 95 experiment training was organized and mainly carried out at EAC.\n\nOn March 17, 1995, he was selected as a member of Crew 2, the backup crew for the Euromir 95 mission, joining Gennadi Manakov and Pavel Vinogradov. During the mission, which lasted 179 days, Fuglesang was the prime crew interface coordinator. From the Russian Mission Control Center (TsUP) in Korolyov, he was the main contact with ESA Astronaut, Thomas Reiter, on Mir, and acted as coordinator between Mir and the Euromir 95 Payloads Operations Control Center, located in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and project management. Between March and June 1996, he underwent specialized training in TsPK on Soyuz operations for de-docking, atmospheric re-entry and landing.\nIn 1996, ESA selected Fuglesang to train as a Mission Specialist for NASA Space Shuttle missions. He joined the Mission Specialist Class at NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, in August 1996, and qualified for flight assignment as a Mission Specialist in April 1998.\n\nFrom May to October 1998, he resumed training at TsPK on Soyuz-TM spacecraft operations for de-docking, atmospheric re-entry and landing. He was awarded the Russian \"Soyuz Return Commander\" certificate, which qualifies him to command a three-person Soyuz capsule on its return from space.\n\nIn October 1998, he returned to NASA and was assigned technical duties in the Station Operations System Branch of the NASA Astronaut Office, working on Russian Soyuz and Progress transfer vehicles. Later he worked as prime Increment Crew Support Astronaut for the second International Space Station expedition crew. Fuglesang also continued with some scientific work and was involved with the SilEye experiment which investigated light flashes in astronauts' eyes on Mir between 1995 and 1999. This work is continuing on the International Space Station (ISS) with the Alteino and ALTEA apparatuses. He has also initiated the DESIRE project to simulate and estimate the radiation environment inside ISS.\n\nFuglesang's first spaceflight mission was as a Mission Specialist on STS-116 in 2006, an assembly and crew-rotation mission to the International Space Station. This flight was called the Celsius Mission by ESA in recognition of Anders Celsius, the Swedish 18th century astronomer who invented the Celsius temperature scale.\n\n\nTotal EVA time during STS-116: 18 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nFuglesang, once a Swedish national Frisbee champion, held the national title in \"maximum time aloft\" in 1978, and subsequently competed in the 1981 World Frisbee Championship. Fuglesang took one of his personal frisbees to the International Space Station. On Dec 15 in 2006, he set a new \"world record\" for Time Aloft by freefloating a spinning frisbee for 20 seconds in the microgravity environment of the ISS. It was done during a live broadcast interview with a space exhibition in Stockholm Sweden. The record attempt was recognised by the sports governing body, the World Flying Disc Federation, and the record was accepted. But since it was set \"outside the earth's atmosphere\" it was recorded as 'Galactic Record'.\n\nOn July 15, 2008 Fuglesang was selected as a mission specialist of the STS-128 that launched August 28–29, 2009. STS-128 (ISS assembly mission \"17A\") delivered equipment allowing the ISS crew to be expanded from three to six astronauts.\n\nDuring STS-128 Fuglesang also became the first spacewalker outside Russia and United States to do more than three spacewalks. With the completion of two more EVAs, he has performed five spacewalks.\n\nTotal EVA time from five spacewalks adds up to 31 hours 54 minutes giving Fuglesang a 29th place in history as of 14 September 2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966127", "title": "Do Somethin'", "text": "Do Somethin'\n\n\"Do Somethin\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her first greatest hits album, \"\" (2004). It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing by Henrik Jonback and Angela Hunte. Before the song was given to Spears, it was originally offered to girl group Melodi Brown, although they never released the song or indeed any material. The song was never intended to be released as a single. Spears, however, wanted to shoot a music video for it, and had to convince her record company. It was then released on February 14, 2005 by Jive Records as the second single from the album worldwide except North America. The dance-pop song features usage of electric guitars, and its lyrics allude to having a good time and not caring about other people's judgement.\n\n\"Do Somethin'\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, and received comparisons to Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". Although the single was not released in the United States, it charted on many of \"Billboard\"s component charts due to digital downloads, managing to reach number 100 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was also successful worldwide, reaching top ten positions in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. By the end of 2005, \"Do Somethin'\" was one of the best-selling singles in Australia and Belgium that year.\n\nAn accompanying music video, co-directed by Billie Woodruff and Spears, who is credited as her alter ego \"Mona Lisa\", portrays the singer and four female friends dancing and performing in a nightclub. The usage of a Louis Vuitton dashboard in the video resulted in a lawsuit against Jive Records, which ended with Louis Vuitton winning €80,000 in damages. The video was also banned in all European TV channels. Spears performed \"Do Somethin'\" during The M+M's Tour in 2007, The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009 and in 2013–17.\n\nOn August 13, 2004, Spears announced through Jive Records the release of her first greatest hits compilation titled \"\", due November 16, 2004. The title was chosen after the album's lead single, Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's 1988 single \"My Prerogative\". The cover was produced by Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single \"Toxic\" from her fourth studio album, \"In the Zone\" (2003). A DVD was also released the same day, containing Spears's music videos. The track list was officially revealed on September 13, 2004. \"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\" included three new tracks: \"My Prerogative\", \"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\" and \"Do Somethin'\", all of them produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The producers recorded and arranged the main instrumentation of \"Do Somethin'\" at Murlyn Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in New York City during the first leg of her tour \"The Onyx Hotel Tour\" in 2004. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Angela Hunte, BlackCell and Emma Holmgren. The song was never planned to be released as a single. However, Spears wanted to shoot a music video for the song and had to fight with her record label to do it. She explained she was \"a little disappointed\" that she had to convince them \"that making this video was the right thing to do at th[e] time\". \"Do Somethin'\" was released as the second single from \"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\" on February 14, 2005.\n\n\"Do Somethin'\" is a dance-pop song with usage of electric guitars and a \"bump beat\", as described by Spence D. of IGN. He also noted the song is \"filled with faux string bursts and mock-'70s synth gurgle (think Zapp/Gap Band era) and plenty of treated guitar and bass\". According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it is set at a moderately fast tempo with 130 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of E minor, and Spears' vocal range spans from the low note of E to the high note of C. Lyrically, \"Do Somethin'\" refers to having fun while being watched by other people, which is perceived in lines such as \"Somebody pass my guitar/So I can look like a star.\" Tim Lee of musicOMH compared the song's style to Gwen Stefani's \"What You Waiting For?\" (2004).\n\n\"Do Somethin'\" received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that along with \"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\", they are \"two very good previously unreleased tunes\". Annabel Leathes of BBC Online commented, \"two robust, unreleased tracks [that] suggest, however, that she may still be churning out a few more No.1s before taking time out to sing lullabies to her brood\", while Christy Lemire of the Associated Press noted that both songs \"provide Britney with further opportunities to proclaim her need to have fun and be herself, which have been running themes throughout her last two albums\". Ann Powers of \"Blender\" called \"Do Somethin'\" \"a decent bit of crunk where she raps in a cutesy-poo drawl that suggests she could have nabbed the \"Dukes of Hazzard\" sexpot role from Jessica Simpson\". Spence D. of IGN considered the song \"interesting for its many interpretations, no less\".\n\nNicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", said that \"nobody does attitude like Britney, and this badass electronic jam is a prime example\". Nayer Nissim, from \"Pink News\", called it \"a solid enough slab of dance pop, though it lacks that little bit of something special that distinguishes her very best singles\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed it at number 33 on their ranking of Spears's songs; \"when fans talk about whether or not Britney sounds like she’s having any fun on her albums, 'Do Somethin' should be the standard by which they measure\". Shannon Barbour from \"Cosmopolitan\" called it Spears' sixth best song. Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj pointed out that \"[Do Somethin']' is significant [because it] stems from the sonic direction it hints towards. Fizzing synths and harder drums pushed Britney into slightly left-field territory, something she'd continue to nurture on her next two albums\n\nAlthough \"Do Somethin'\" was never physically released in the United States, the song peaked at number 100 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 due to digital downloads on April 26, 2005. The song also charted on \"Billboard\"s Pop 100 and Hot Digital Songs at number 63 and 49, respectively. As of August 2010, \"Do Somethin'\" has sold 363,000 paid digital downloads in the United States. In Australia, the song debuted at number 8 on the week of March 7, 2005. It has since been certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) with sales of over 35,000 copies. On the same week, it debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number 6. \"Do Somethin'\" was also successful in Europe, inside the Top 10 in Belgium (Flanders), Hungary, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland, and inside the Top 20 in Belgium (Wallonia), Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\n\nThe music video for \"Do Somethin'\" was filmed in December 2004 in Los Angeles, California. It was co-directed by Spears and Billie Woodruff, who previously worked with her in \"Born to Make You Happy\" and in \"Overprotected\". Spears described the shoot as \"hectic\", adding it was filmed \"in a record-breaking five hours\". She also commented about co-directing with Woodruff, saying that \"he had no ego whatsoever, and the whole process was just so much fun\". Spears is credited as \"Mona Lisa\" in the video, as she said \"I kinda think she's like my alter ego whenever I feel like being mean or possibly like bustin' people around to get stuff right ... It's kinda easier to be called 'Mona Lisa' instead of Britney\". The video was also choreographed and styled entirely by Spears, with clothing from Juicy Couture. Spears ultimately added that working behind the camera inspired her to become a director in the future, explaining, \"After doing about 20 videos, it gets kind of boring playing the same role. I feel like being behind the camera is sometimes more satisfying than being in front of it\".\n\nIn the music video, Spears wears a pink midriff T-shirt reading \"Love Boat\" and a pin capelet going to a club named Hole in the Wall with four blond bandmates. During the first verse, they fly in a pink Hummer and move their heads to the beat on the song, while Spears puts the truck on autopilot. The Hummer's dashboard has a Louis Vuitton pattern. They finally arrive to the club and dance in the dancefloor while being stared at by other people. Near the end of the video, Spears and her bandmates start performing on a stage. The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears in a separate room, wearing black underwear and a white mini fur coat, that was compared to the black-and-white scenes in the music video for \"My Prerogative\".\n\nJennifer Vineyard of MTV described Spears's attitude in the video as \"[going] back and forth between trying to look sexy and then goofy\". Since the music video was not going to be serviced in the United States, it was set to premiere in MTV UK on January 21, 2005. However, it was leaked online on January 18, 2005.\n\nOn November 18, 2007, it was reported by \"Forbes\" that LVMH's Louis Vuitton won a lawsuit on 80,000 EUR (approximately $94,000 in USD) in damages for the close-up shots of the truck's dashboard, which featured the brand's logo without authorization. The tribunal found the director of the video had clearly emphasized the logo. The tribunal ruled that responsibility for the unauthorized use lay with Sony BMG, its subsidiary Zomba Group of Companies as well as MTV Online, and not Spears herself. The music video was also banned in all European TV channels. The edited video was re-released through Vevo on July 19, 2015.\n\nSpears performed \"Do Somethin'\" during The M+M's Tour in May 2007. After a performance of \"Breathe on Me\" from \"In the Zone\", in which Spears and her four female dancers picked a man from the audience and danced seductively around him, the stage went dark for a few seconds. Shortly after, Spears took the stage again wearing a hot pink bra, a white fur coat and a jean skirt to perform the song. The choreography was a mimicry of the music video. The song was also performed at her 2009 tour, The Circus Starring Britney Spears. It was the second song of the fourth and last act, titled \"Electro Circ\". In some parts of the performance, Spears and her dancers carried giant guns that shot sparks. During the first shows of the first North American leg, she wore a gold metal bodysuit. However, on March 8, 2009, at the Tampa show, Spears suffered a wardrobe malfunction after her performance of \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", which caused the outfit being changed to a sparkly black bodysuit. The song was later performed in Spears' Las Vegas residency from 2013 to 2017. She was seen wearing a bodysuit and doing a routine with black chairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966128", "title": "The Curse of Chalion", "text": "The Curse of Chalion\n\nThe Curse of Chalion is a 2001 fantasy novel by American writer Lois McMaster Bujold. In 2002 it won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature and was nominated for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and Locus Fantasy Awards in 2002. The series that it began, World of the Five Gods, won the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2018.\n\nBoth \"The Curse of Chalion\" and its sequel \"Paladin of Souls\" (2003) are set in the landlocked medieval kingdom of Chalion. The prequel \"The Hallowed Hunt\" (2005) takes place in the Weald to the south of Chalion and two to three hundred years earlier.\n\nCazaril was formerly a noble in the land of Chalion, but was betrayed and sold into slavery. He returns to a regional court where he is hired as tutor to Iselle (second in line for the throne of Chalion after her brother Teidez) and her handmaid Betriz, for whom he develops romantic feelings. Their mother Ista also lives with them, but is considered mad.\n\nHe accompanies Teidez, Iselle and Betriz to the capital, where he encounters his betrayer Dondo, whose brother Martou is chancellor to the ailing monarch Orico. Orico spends much time in his menagerie, run by the exile Umegat. The corrupt Dondo spends time with Teidez, exposing the boy to various vices, and arranges a marriage to Iselle. In desperation, Cazaril calls on the Bastard (one of the five gods) for a miracle of death magic, accepting that if it succeeds in killing Dondo, his life will be claimed as well. Dondo dies, but Cazaril does not, finding himself gifted with second sight by the experience. With Umegat's help, he learns that the royal family of Chalion is under a generation-old curse, and that Orico is only sustained through the cleansing magic of the menagerie. He also finds that Dondo's soul and the Bastard's death demon are bound to his body in the form of a tumor, with the demon trying to bring about his death so it can return to the gods with the required two souls.\n\nActing on misinformation from Dondo, Teidez destroys the menagerie and severely injures Umegat, but a wound he sustains in the process becomes infected and proves fatal. Orico collapses, leaving Iselle soon to assume the throne, but her power is constrained by Martou, who spreads rumors that she is unstable like her mother. Cazaril informs Iselle of the curse, and his belief that since Ista married into the curse, Iselle could marry out of it. She dispatches him in secret to arrange her marriage to the heir of Ibra, a neighbouring country. He speaks to Ista on the way, and learns of a prophecy that the curse can be broken by a man \"willing to lay down his life three times for the House of Chalion.\" Cazaril has done so once, but because of the demon, his next death must be final.\n\nArriving in Ibra, he finds that he had previously met the heir Bergon, taking a severe beating meant for the boy while they both were slaves. Informing Bergon of the curse, they convince Bergon's father to agree to the marriage. They return to Chalion, fighting through an ambush set by Martou. Iselle has also escaped from Martou, and she and Bergon are married. However, instead of freeing Iselle from the curse, it spreads to Bergon.\n\nMartou and his men attack, trying to kill Bergon and recapture Iselle. Cazaril fights them off as long as he can, but is captured. Martou stabs him through the body, hitting Cazaril's tumor. The release of the demon takes with it the souls of Cazaril, Dondo, and Martou, and the Daughter (another of the five gods) saves Cazaril's soul, leaving the demon to carry off the others. With his soul expanded by accepting his third death (taking the beating for Bergon, invoking death magic for Iselle, and now fighting to hold off Martou), the Daughter uses Cazaril's soul as a window to reach into the physical world and cleanse the curse. She returns him to his body, invoking one last miracle to spare him from dying of fever from his wound.\n\nIselle is crowned to rule Chalion, with Bergon as her consort and their children to inherit both lands. Cazaril is made chancellor, and he and Betriz are happily married.\n\n\"The Curse of Chalion\" and other books in the World of the Five Gods series are set in a world loosely based on southern Europe during the time of the \"Reconquista\", or Spanish Reconquest. The states of Chalion, Ibra, and Brajar are fictional equivalents of Castile and León, Aragon, and Portugal, respectively. In Bujold's world, these states are in the south and are subject to invaders from the north, the Roknari, who correspond to the Muslims during the Reconquest.\n\nCharacters in \"The Curse of Chalion\" also have historical equivalents. Iselle of Chalion is based on Isabella I of Castile, Bergon of Ibra is based on Ferdinand II of Aragon, and their secret marriage reflects the secret betrothal of Isabella and Ferdinand. The character Teidez corresponds to Alfonso Prince of Asturias.\n\nThe book has received a number of reviews. It was nominated for the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Novel. The World of the Five Gods series won the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2018.\n\n"}

It is one of two remaining original historic covered bridges in the state, (the other being the Bunker Hill Covered Bridge in Claremont, North Carolina) and is designated as both a local and federal historic landmark.\n\nThe bridge was built in 1911 by J. J. Welch at a cost of $40. It is a one-lane bridge, 54 feet in length. The bridge eventually became obsolete when it could no longer handle the increased traffic, but it remains as a tourist attraction located at 6925 Pisgah Covered Bridge Road, west of the community of Pisgah. The road now crosses a nearby two-lane concrete bridge built in the 1950s.\n\nSince 1998, the North Carolina Zoo Society has collaborated with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Piedmont Land Conservancy, and the Landtrust for Central North Carolina to maintain and refurbish the bridge. The bridge was washed away by a flood on August 9, 2003, but was rebuilt the next year using much of the original materials that were retrieved by local area volunteers. The restoration was able to salvage about 90 percent of the materials from the original structure. The bridge is assumed originally to have had a shingle roof; however, it was replaced with tin in the 1930s. In the restoration, the roof was shingled.\n\nThere is now a gate on the road leading to the bridge, however, it is open to the public daily from dawn to dusk.\n\nThe bridge appears to have been defaced by visitors, who have seen fit to scrawl graffiti, some of which is obscene and offensive, the length and breadth of the structure.\n\nThere is a quarter-mile trail through the woods on site.

It is perhaps Porter's most popular contribution to the Great American Songbook and has been recorded by dozens of musicians.\n\nFred Astaire introduced \"Night and Day\" on stage. His recording of the song with the Leo Reisman orchestra was a No. 1 hit, topping the charts of the day for ten weeks. He performed it again in the 1934 film version of the show, renamed \"The Gay Divorcee\", and it became one of his signature songs.\n\nThere are several accounts about the song's origin. One mentions that Porter was inspired by an Islamic prayer when he visited Morocco. Another account says he was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the Alcazar Hotel in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.. Others mention that he was inspired by a Mosaic of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, he had been visiting during a trip of his honeymoon in Italy. \n\nThe song was so associated with Porter that when Hollywood filmed his life story in 1946, the movie was entitled \"Night and Day\".\n\nIn addition to the numerous covers that have followed its official release, this song has entered fully what could be described as the collective unconscious. Thereby, artists such as Hozier have hinted at this song. The Irish singer has thus alluded the song in his own song called \"Almost\" published through the release of his sophomore album, \"Wasteland, Baby!\". The lyrics being as followed: \"The drums that start off \"Night And Day\" \"\n\nThe construction of \"Night and Day\" is unusual for a hit song of the 1930s. Most popular tunes then featured 32-bar choruses, divided into four 8-bar sections, usually with an AABA musical structure, the B section representing the bridge.\n\nPorter's song, on the other hand, has a chorus of 48 bars, divided into six sections of eight bars—ABABCB—with section C representing the bridge.\n\n\"Night and Day\" has unusual chord changes (the underlying harmony).\n\nThe tune begins with a pedal (repeated) dominant with a major seventh chord built on the flattened sixth of the key, which then resolves to the dominant seventh in the next bar. If performed in the key of B, the first chord is therefore G major seventh, with an F (the major seventh above the harmonic root) in the melody, before resolving to F7 and eventually B maj7.\n\nThis section repeats and is followed by a descending harmonic sequence starting with a -75 (half diminished seventh chord or Ø) built on the augmented fourth of the key, and descending by semitones—with changes in the chord quality—to the supertonic minor seventh, which forms the beginning of a more standard II-V-I progression. In B, this sequence begins with an EØ, followed by an E-7, D-7 and D dim, before resolving onto C-7 (the supertonic minor seventh) and cadencing onto B.\n\nThe bridge is also unusual, with an immediate, fleeting and often (depending on the version) unprepared key change up a minor third, before an equally transient and unexpected return to the key centre. In B, the bridge begins with a D major seventh, then moves back to B with a B major seventh chord. This repeats, and is followed by a recapitulation of the second section outlined above.\n\nThe vocal verse is also unusual in that most of the melody consists entirely of a single note repeated 35 times —the same dominant pedal, that begins the body of the song—with rather inconclusive and unusual harmonies underneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is considered to have been one of the deadliest gunfighters in the Old West.\n\nBill Longley was born on Mill Creek in Austin County, Texas, the sixth of ten children of Campbell and Sarah Longley. His family moved when he was two years old and he was raised on a farm near Old Evergreen, Texas, in present-day Lincoln, Lee County, Texas, where he spent a large part of his childhood learning to shoot. He received an average education for the time. He was six feet (183 cm) tall with a thin build, jet black hair, and was just reaching adulthood when the American Civil War ended in 1865.\n\nBy 1867, Texas was fully under the control of the Union due to the Reconstruction Act. The military acted in all capacities, including law enforcement, which caused considerable resentment throughout the state. Around this time, Longley dropped out of school and began living a wild life, drinking, and running in the company of others of a similar disposition.\n\nIn 1867 the Longley family farm was just one mile from the Camino Real, an old Spanish royal highway that joined San Antonio and Nacogdoches, Texas.\n\nIn mid-December 1868, three former slaves named Green Evans, Pryer Evans, and the third known only as Ned, rode through Evergreen, intending evidently to visit friends further south. Longley, accompanied by a couple of friends, forced the three men at gunpoint into a dry creek bed. Green Evans panicked and spurred his horse to escape. Longley shot at him several times, killing him.\n\nLongley and his friends went through the dead man's pockets, as Pryer Evans and Ned rode away. Although given sole responsibility for the murder, Longley later claimed that he was not the only one shooting. Longley's account of this murder differs from that of his later killings, where he was more inclined to brag about shooting men than to try to divert blame to others. Some versions of Evan's killing claim he was a member of the Texas State Police; the TSP only existed from 1870 to 1873.\n\nLongley drifted around Texas for a time, and while gambling in saloons he became acquainted with noted gambler Phil Coe In 1869, Longley and his brother-in-law, John Wilson, embarked on a crime spree through southern Texas. Together they robbed settlers, and in one instance killed a freed slave named Paul Brice in Bastrop County, Texas, after which they stole his horses. They reportedly also killed a freed slave woman in Evergreen.\n\nIn March 1870, a $1,000 reward for their capture was offered by the Union military authority. Longley later claimed that Wilson was killed by outlaws in 1870 in Brazos County, Texas, although conflicting evidence suggests he was actually killed in 1874 in Falls County, Texas.\n\nLongley left Texas and moved north to avoid the authorities and by May 1870, he had joined a gold-hunting party in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nThe gold mining party travelled into the Black Hills of South Dakota, but a treaty with the Sioux prohibited mining, and the party disbanded when intercepted by a U.S. cavalry unit. On June 22, 1870, Longley enlisted for a five-year commitment in the army, joining Company B of the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment. His unit was stationed at Camp Stambaugh. He deserted two weeks later, as he was unable to adapt to the strict lifestyle, but was captured and court-martialed. He was sentenced to two years hard labor, strapped to a ball and chain, and imprisoned at Camp Stambaugh. He was held for four months and then released to return to his unit. His marksmanship skills were noticed, and he was assigned to the regular hunting parties regularly leaving the post. He deserted again in May 1872.\n\nLongley's travels for the rest of 1872 are unknown, but by February 1873 he had returned to Texas, where he was accused of murdering another freedman in Bastrop County. Following that, he returned to live with his father's family in Bell County, Texas. In the summer of that year, Mason County Sheriff, J. J. Finney, arrested Longley for murder and took him to Austin to collect a reward. When the federal military reward was not forthcoming from state officials, however, Finney released Longley, possibly in exchange for a bribe from Longley's uncle, Alexander \"Pres\" Preston Longley, of California.\n\nOn March 31, 1875, Longley killed his childhood friend, Wilson Anderson, with a shotgun. The murder was alleged to have been instigated by Longley's uncle, Caleb B. Longley, who had blamed Anderson for the death of his son, Cale, and urged Longley to take revenge. Longley then fled northward, accompanied by his brother, James Stockton Longley, who was later tried and acquitted of Anderson's murder. A new reward was posted for Longley's capture.\n\nUnder increasing pressure from law enforcement, Longley fled from place to place and used several aliases to avoid arrest. He briefly found work on a cotton farm, but he was forced to run again in November 1875, after murdering a hunting buddy named George Thomas with whom he had had a fistfight.\n\nLongley committed another killing in Uvalde County, Texas in January 1876, when his attempted ambush of fellow outlaw, Lou Shroyer, turned into a gunfight. Shroyer shot Longley's horse out from under him, but Longley shot Shroyer dead. This is the only known case in Longley's career where one of his victims returned fire.\n\nFleeing again, Longley went to east Texas and became a sharecropper for a preacher, William R. Lay. Stability eluded him again, however, when Longley became rivals with Lay's nephew for the affections of a young woman. Longley beat up his rival, was subsequently jailed, and escaped. Longley blamed Lay for his brief imprisonment. On June 13, 1876, Longley rode out to his landlord's farm, found him milking a cow, and murdered him with a shotgun. Lay was the last man known to have been killed by Longley.\n\nLongley next possibly went to Grayson County, Texas, where two of his friends, Jim and Dick Sanders, were in jail. Longley broke them out, and the trio escaped, disarming deputy Matt Shelton when he tried to arrest them. Longley fled to Louisiana. Approximately one year later, deputy Matt Shelton confirmed the encounter.\n\nOn June 6, 1877, Longley was surrounded and arrested without incident by Nacogdoches County Sheriff Milt Mast and two deputies while he was residing in De Soto Parish, Louisiana under the alias \"Bill Jackson.\" He was returned to Texas, tried in the Lee County Court, and sentenced to hang for the murder of Wilson Anderson. His appeal was denied in March 1878. On October 11, 1878, Longley was executed by hanging in Giddings, Texas, only a few miles from his birthplace of Evergreen. His grave and a state historical marker are in the Giddings City Cemetery.\n\nLongley claimed to have killed thirty-two people, mostly of African American heritage.\n\nYears after the execution, Longley's father, Campbell, came forward in a press release stating that his son had \"not\" been executed, and the death had been faked. After confirming the location of Longley's grave site, an exhumation of the human remains was performed in 2000. They were taken to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D. C., where DNA tests were performed, along with a skull reconstruction. In June 2001, it was officially reported that the remains from the grave site were indeed those of Bill Longley.\n\nNumerous myths and legends have grown up about Longley that cannot be verified by any contemporary source. Many of these legends trace back to tall tales that Longley himself told while imprisoned in Giddings in 1877. Some of these stories are probably false, while others could be true but lack any contemporary corroborating evidence. Longley's lies appear to have been motivated partly by his desire to rival John Wesley Hardin's reputation as a killer. Longley was outraged when he found he was to be put to death, while Hardin had only been sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.\n\nThe most clearly false story Longley told was of being captured and lynched in 1869 alongside one of Cullen Baker's outlaw gang, surviving when a lucky shot severed the rope he had been hanged from, and then joining Baker's riders. As Baker was dead and his band dispersed at the time Longley claimed this happened, the story cannot be true. There is no contemporaneous evidence to back claims that Longley murdered a black militiaman in Old Evergreen in 1866 for insulting his father, or that he shot eight black people in Lexington in 1867 to avenge the loss of a horse racing bet. Furthermore, Longley would have been 14 and 15 years old respectively at the time of the alleged incidents. True or false, the stories are consistent with Longley's well-established racist character; in his own words he \"...was taught to believe it was right to kill sassy negroes...\"\n\nLongley's account of killing a trail boss named Rector while en route to Wyoming in 1870 is similarly of unknown veracity.\n\nTraditionally, Longley is said to have used a pair of Dance .44 revolvers; the Dance was a Texas-manufactured imitation of the Colt Dragoon. However, he used a shotgun to kill both Wilson Anderson and William Lay, his only murders for which his weapon is definitely known.\n\nLongley is a major character in \"The Pistoleer,\" a novel by James Carlos Blake (Berkley Books, NY, 1995).\n\nIn 1954, the actor Douglas Kennedy played Longley in an episode of the syndicated western television series \"Stories of the Century\".\n\nIn 1958, Steve McQueen played Longley in Season 2, Episode 23 of Tales of Wells Fargo.\n\nLongley is the title character in The Texan, a television series starring Rory Calhoun which aired on CBS from 1958-1960, and portrayed Longley in an heroic role, a wanderer throughout the American West who assists those having trouble with the lawless element.\n\nLongley figures prominently in Louis L'Amour's 1959 novel \"The First Fast Draw\", a highly fictionalized version of Cullen Baker's life.\n\nTexas singer/songwriter, Houston Marchman, wrote a song about Longley, \"Bill Longley,\" which is on his second CD \"Leavin' Dallas\" (1999).\n\n\n"}

It features several glasshouses, the most notable of which is the Kibble Palace.\n\nThe Gardens has a wide variety of temperate and tropical flora, a herb garden, a chronological bed with plants arranged according to their introduction to Scotland, the UK's national collection of tree ferns, and a world rose garden officially opened in 2003 by Princess Tomohito of Mikasa.\n\nThe River Kelvin runs along the north side of the Gardens and continues through Kelvingrove Park, the Kelvin walkway providing an uninterrupted walking route between the two green spaces.\n\nThe Botanic Gardens was awarded a Green Flag Award in 2011.\n\nIn 1817 about 8 acres (32,000 m) of land were laid out at Sandyford, near Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, and run by the Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow (founded by Thomas Hopkirk of Dalbeth), and were intended to supply the University of Glasgow. William Hooker was regius professor of botany at Glasgow University, and contributed to the development of the Botanic Gardens before his appointment to the directorship of Kew Gardens in London. The Gardens moved to its current location in 1842. The gardens were originally used for concerts and other events, and in 1891 the gardens were incorporated into the Parks and Gardens of the City of Glasgow.\n\nThe site was once served by a railway line, and Botanic Gardens Railway Station remains today in a derelict state as a remarkable example of a disused station. It is hidden behind some trees and a metal fence blocks access to the platforms. Kirklee railway station also lies just inside the gardens.\n\nThe Kibble Palace is a 19th-century wrought iron framed glasshouse, covering 2137 m. Originally designed for John Kibble by architects James Boucher and James Cousland for his home at Coulport on Loch Long in the 1860s, the components were cast by Walter Macfarlane at his Saracen Foundry in Possilpark. Eventually brought up the River Clyde by barge to the Botanic Gardens, it was fully erected at its current location in 1873 by Boyd of Paisley.\n\nThe building structure is of curved wrought iron and glass supported by cast iron beams resting on ornate columns, surmounted on masonry foundations. It was initially used as an exhibition and concert venue, before being used for growing plants from the 1880s. Benjamin Disraeli and William Ewart Gladstone were both installed as rectors of the University of Glasgow in the palace, in 1873 and 1879 respectively - its last use as a public events venue, before becoming wholly used for the cultivation of temperate plants. The main plant group is the collection of New Zealand and Australian tree ferns, some of which have lived here for 120 years and which now form the national tree fern collection.\n\nIn the 1920s a statue was added in the palace to \"King Robert of Sicily\" a figure from the works of Longfellow. This is by the Scottish sculptor George Henry Paulin.\n\nIn 2004 a £7 million restoration programme was initiated to repair corrosion of the ironwork. The restoration involved the complete dismantling of the Palace, and the removal of the parts to Shepley Engineers' Shafton Works, South Yorkshire for specialised repair and conservation. The plant collection was removed completely for the first time ever and the ironwork was rebuilt over a rearranged floorplan, giving the Palace a prolonged life. It re-opened to the public in November 2006.\n\nThe building contains a large collection of orchids, carnivorous plants and tree ferns.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966185", "title": "Waterphone", "text": "Waterphone\n\nA waterphone (also ocean harp or AquaSonic waterphone) is a type of inharmonic acoustic tuned idiophone consisting of a stainless steel resonator \"bowl\" or \"pan\" with a cylindrical \"neck\" and bronze rods of different lengths and diameters around the rim of the bowl. The resonator may contain a small amount of water giving the waterphone a vibrant ethereal sound that has appeared in movie soundtracks, record albums, and live performances. The instrument was invented and developed by Richard Waters.\n\nSeveral sizes and design variants of the instrument exist. It is generally played in a seated position by a soloist and either bowed or drummed, played as a friction or struck idiophone, with movements to affect the water inside. This combines the resonant characteristics of the bowl and rods in combination with the movement of the water. The sound of the waterphone is often used to evoke mystery and suspense. A superball mallet has become the prime way of drumming the waterphone.\n\nThe waterphone is a modern invention influenced by a Tibetan drum—encountered by the inventor in the early sixties—containing a small amount of water affecting its timbre. It is also related to the nail violin, which also used a resonator and rods (nails), and is struck or bowed.\n\nThe waterphone has been exhibited in museums and galleries and is the subject of several short documentaries including \"Art Notes,\" aired on public television in San Francisco, and \"Celestial Wave,\" a movie short. Over recent decades the waterphone has become popular with symphonies, touring bands, and recording studios. Contemporary classical composers who have written parts for waterphone in compositions include Sofia Gubaidulina,Jerry Goldsmith, John Mackey, Christopher Rouse, Colin Matthews, John Woolrich, Carson Cooman, Andi Spicer, Ludovico Einaudi, Andrew Carter, Bernie Krause of Beaver & Krause,and Todd Barton.\n\nThe instrument has also been used prominently by rock musicians. Tom Waits is a waterphone collector and player as is Mickey Hart. Other users include Richard Barone (both solo and with The Bongos) and Alex Wong (when playing with Vienna Teng), and it can be heard in music by The Harmonica Pocket. Classical/rock crossover percussionist Tristan Fry of the fusion band Sky used a waterphone on the band's composition 'Meeheeco' (the original version is on 1981's \"Sky 3\", although the instrument can be heard much more prominently on the live version from \"Sky Five Live\").\n\nCanadian musician and composer, Robert Minden, has been composing for his collection of five vintage waterphones on many recordings since the mid-1980s. His ensemble, The Robert Minden Ensemble, formed with daughters Andrea and Dewi Minden and colleagues Carla Hallett and Nancy Walker in 1986, features the waterphone as a central instrument within their 'found object' orchestra. \n\nThe waterphone is used to great effect in Howard Goodall's \"The Dreaming\", a musical commissioned by The National Youth Music Theatre of Great Britain, based on Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Goodall uses its ethereal sounds to evoke the mystery of the woods. In Derek Bourgeois' Symphony No 59 - Percussion symphony, which requires 16 percussion players there is a very prominent part for Waterphone.\n\nThe waterphone has been featured in the soundtracks to many movies, including \"Poltergeist\", \"Let the Right One In\" (2008), \"The Matrix\", \",\" \"Dark Water\", \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", \"ALIENS\", \"The Spirit\", \"Female Perversion\", as well as TV production \"24\". Tan Dun's opera \"The First Emperor\" (2006) & \"Water Music\" feature the waterphone. A sound sample can be found at The FreeSound Project. There is a yearly \"Waterphone Music Competition\" sponsored by Richard Waters.\n\nAs the waterphone may be taken into the water, on several occasions the waterphone has been used successfully to call whales and other cetaceans, especially by Jim Nollman of Interspecies Communication. The true story of such interspecies communication was the basis of the stage show and album \"The Boy Who Wanted To Talk To Whales\" by The Robert Minden Ensemble in 1989.\n\n\n"}

An All-American quarterback for the Auburn Tigers, he won the Heisman Trophy in 1971 and then played six seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Atlanta Falcons and Washington Redskins. Sullivan was a head football coach at Samford University, a position he held from 2007 to 2014. He was previously the head football coach at Texas Christian University (TCU) from 1992 to 1997 and the offensive coordinator at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 1999 to 2006. Sullivan was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1991.\n\nBorn in Birmingham, Alabama, Sullivan began his athletic career as a three-sport star at Birmingham's John Carroll Catholic High School. Although a talented baseball and basketball player, he chose to play football for Auburn University where he would become the starting quarterback in 1969 under the tutelage of head coach Ralph Jordan. Over the next three seasons, the tall and Sullivan would break school and NCAA records for passing while leading the team to a 26–7 record. In 1970, he led the NCAA in total offense with 2,856 yards and set an NCAA record for most yards per play with 8.57. In his career, he was responsible for 72 touchdowns (54 passing/18 rushing) to tie the NCAA record. In his senior season, Sullivan completed 162 passes on 281 attempts for 2,012 yards and 20 touchdowns. This performance was enough to edge out Ed Marinaro for the 1971 Heisman Trophy. Also an excellent student, Sullivan was named an Academic All-American and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1972. Sullivan finished his college career with 6,284 passing yards and 54 touchdowns, along with another 18 touchdowns on the ground. He was selected to play in the Senior Bowl, where he led the South to victory over the North and was given the game's Most Valuable Player award.\n\nAfter college, Sullivan had a six-season professional NFL football career. He was a second-round selection (40th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Sullivan played with the Falcons from 1972 to 1976, and then the Washington Redskins in 1976 and 1977. He played in 30 games. In 1974, Sullivan started three games for the Atlanta Falcons, losing all three. He completed 48 of 105 passes and one touchdown. In 1975, he threw for 3 touchdowns, completing 28 of 70 passes. He continued his career with the Redskins in 1976. Sullivan left football to enter private business in Birmingham, where he worked in insurance and as a tire company executive.\n\nSullivan spent five seasons doing radio color commentary for Auburn football games before joining the staff at Auburn in 1986 as quarterbacks coach under head coach Pat Dye. He worked with Auburn quarterbacks Jeff Burger, Reggie Slack, and Stan White during his six years at Auburn. During his time as an assistant Auburn won, or shared, three Southeastern Conference championships and had a four-game winning streak against archrival Alabama.\n\nOn January 2, 1992, Sullivan became the 27th head football coach of Texas Christian University, inheriting a probation-racked team. After two losing seasons, he led TCU to a 7–5 mark in 1994 to win a share of the Southwest Conference championship, the school's first SWC title since 1959. Following the 1994 season, prior to the Horned Frogs' appearance in the Independence Bowl versus Virginia, Sullivan agreed to become the head coach at Louisiana State University (LSU). However, LSU refused to pay the $400,000 buyout of Sullivan's TCU contract, and the Tigers hired Vanderbilt University coach Gerry DiNardo three days later.\n\nThe next season produced another winning record of 6–5 before TCU joined the Western Athletic Conference in 1996 and fell once again on hard times. Losing seasons in 1996 and 1997 resulted in Sullivan's resignation in October 1997 with an overall record of 24–42–1. However, he is best known for having recruited LaDainian Tomlinson to play at TCU.\n\nIn January 1999, Sullivan became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of UAB. He helped develop Darrell Hackney into the best quarterback in UAB history who was able to make it to the NFL as an undrafted free agent picked up by the Cleveland Browns. UAB's offense also featured wide receiver Roddy White, who later played for the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nAfter neck surgery in September 2003, Sullivan was diagnosed with throat cancer by Dr. William R. Carroll (squamous cell carcinoma) and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in December. In April 2004, doctors told him he was clear of cancer, but he continued to be monitored for recurrence. Sullivan missed only one game coaching in the 2003 season due to treatment, but lost around 50 pounds over the course of his cancer treatment.\n\nOn December 1, 2006, Sullivan was named head coach at Samford University, replacing Bill Gray. In 2008, the Bulldogs joined the Southern Conference and won the championship in 2013. He resigned after the 2014 season, his eighth season as coach.\n\nSullivan was married to the former Jean Hicks of Birmingham and they had three children — Kim, and twins Kelly and Patrick, Jr.\n\nPat Sullivan died on December 1, 2019 after a long battle with cancer. On January 1, 2020, Auburn players wore \"7\" decals on the left side of their helmets during the Outback Bowl to commemorate Sullivan. \n\nSullivan was selected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, class of 1981. In 1988, he was also a charter member of the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame. The football field house at Samford University was renamed in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}

This acid is diprotic (readily ionizes two protons), not triprotic as might be suggested by this formula. Phosphorous acid is an intermediate in the preparation of other phosphorus compounds. Organic derivatives of phosphorous acid, compounds with the formula RPOH, are called phosphonic acids.\n\nHPO is more clearly described with the structural formula HPO(OH). In the solid state, HP(O)(OH) is tetrahedral with one shorter P=O bond of 148 pm and two longer P–O(H) bonds of 154 pm. This species exists in equilibrium with an extremely minor tautomer P(OH). IUPAC recommends that the latter be called phosphorous acid, whereas the dihydroxy form is called phosphonic acid. Only the reduced phosphorus compounds are spelled with an \"ous\" ending.\n\nOther important oxyacids of phosphorus are phosphoric acid (HPO) and hypophosphorous acid (HPO). The reduced phosphorus acids are subject to similar tautomerism involving shifts of H between O and P.\n\nHPO(OH) is the product of the hydrolysis of its acid anhydride:\n(An analogous relationship connects HPO and PO).\n\nOn an industrial scale, the acid is prepared by hydrolysis of phosphorus trichloride with water or steam:\n\nPotassium phosphite is also a convenient precursor to phosphorous acid:\nIn practice aqueous potassium phosphite is treated with excess hydrochloric acid. By concentrating the solution and precipitations with alcohols, the pure acid can be separated from the salt.\n\nPhosphorous acid has a p\"K\" in the range 1.26–1.3. \nIt is a diprotic acid, the hydrogenphosphite ion, HP(O)(OH) is a weak acid:\n\nThe conjugate base HP(O)(OH) is called hydrogen phosphite, and the second conjugate base, , is the phosphite ion. (Note that the IUPAC recommendations are hydrogen phosphonate and phosphonate respectively).\n\nThe hydrogen atom bonded directly to the phosphorus atom is not readily ionizable. Chemistry examinations often test students' appreciation of the fact that \"not\" all three hydrogen atoms are acidic under aqueous conditions, in contrast with HPO.\n\nOn heating at 200 °C, phosphorous acid disproportionates to phosphoric acid and phosphine: \nThis reaction is used for laboratory-scale preparations of PH.\n\nBoth phosphorous acid and its deprotonated forms are good reducing agents, although not necessarily quick to react. They are oxidized to phosphoric acid or its salts. It reduces solutions of noble metal cations to the metals. When phosphorous acid is treated with a cold solution of mercuric chloride, a white precipitate of mercurous chloride forms:\nMercurous chloride is reduced further by phosphorous acid to mercury on heating or on standing:\n\nUpon treatment with metals of d6 configuration, phosphorous acid is known to coordinate as the otherwise rare P(OH) tautomer. Examples include Mo(CO)(P(OH)) and [Ru(NH)(HO)(P(OH))].\nThe most important use of phosphorous acid (phosphonic acid) is the production of basic lead phosphite, which is a stabilizer in PVC and related chlorinated polymers. \n\nPhosphites have shown effectiveness in controlling a variety of plant diseases, in particular, treatment using either trunk injection or foliar containing phosphorous acid salts is indicated in response to infections by \"phytophthora\" and \"pythium\"-type plant pathogens (both within class \"oomycetes\", known as water molds), such as dieback/root rot and downy mildew. Anti-microbial products containing salts of phosphorous acid are marketed in Australia as 'Yates Anti-Rot'; and in the United States of America, for example, aluminum salts of the monoethyl ester of phosphorous acid (known generically as 'Fosetyl-Al') are sold under the trade name 'Aliette' and potassium salts of phosphorous acid (known generically as potassium phosphite) are sold under the trade name ProPhyt. Phosphorous acid and its salts, unlike phosphoric acid, are somewhat toxic and should be handled carefully.\n\nThe IUPAC (mostly organic) name is phosphonic acid. This nomenclature is commonly reserved for substituted derivatives, that is, organic group bonded to phosphorus, not simply an ester. For example, (CH)PO(OH) is \"methylphosphonic acid\", which may of course form \"methylphosphonate\" esters.\n\n"}

In 2003, their horse Candy Ride won six races in a row including the Grade I Pacific Classic Stakes in which he set a new Del Mar track record for one and a quarter miles. Another Craig owned horse, Sidney's Candy, named after Sid Craig, ran in the 2010 Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn April 1995, while reposing in a favorite armchair and napping, she was startled awake, which caused a strange medical anomaly that mimicked lockjaw but was not, as Craig was eventually able to pry her mouth open. Though there seemed to be no imminent threat, Craig's condition gradually worsened making it difficult for her to speak and eat. Her dentist diagnosed temporomandibular joint syndrome, for which she was referred to a specialist, though to little avail. She was, in turn, referred to a series of physicians (reportedly 18) all of whom provided various suggestions but ultimately no solution. In the spring of 1998, she was introduced to Dr. Dennis M. Nigro, typically a cosmetic surgeon, who assessed that Craig had suffered atrophying of her mouth muscles. Corrective surgery was provided by installing bioabsorbable screws into her cheeks. She underwent a four-and-a-half-hour operation and another year of speech therapy. Craig has since fully recovered from the debilitating condition.\n\n"}

{"id": "1966238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966238", "title": "Tuple space", "text": "Tuple space\n\nA tuple space is an implementation of the associative memory paradigm for parallel/distributed computing. It provides a repository of tuples that can be accessed concurrently. As an illustrative example, consider that there are a group of processors that produce pieces of data and a group of processors that use the data. Producers post their data as tuples in the space, and the consumers then retrieve data from the space that match a certain pattern. This is also known as the blackboard metaphor. Tuple space may be thought as a form of distributed shared memory.\n\nTuple spaces were the theoretical underpinning of the Linda language developed by David Gelernter and Nicholas Carriero at Yale University in 1986.\n\nImplementations of tuple spaces have also been developed for Java (JavaSpaces), Lisp, Lua, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Tcl, and the .NET framework.\n\nObject Spaces is a paradigm for development of distributed computing applications. It is characterized by the existence of logical entities, called \"Object Spaces\". All the participants of the distributed application share an \"Object Space\". A provider of a service encapsulates the service as an \"Object\", and puts it in the \"Object Space\". Clients of a service then access the \"Object Space\", find out which object provides the needed service, and have the request serviced by the object.\n\n\"Object Spaces\", as a computing paradigm, was put forward in the 1980s by David Gelernter at Yale University. Gelernter developed a language called Linda to support the concept of global object coordination.\n\n\"Object Space\" can be thought of as a virtual repository, shared amongst providers and accessors of network services, which are themselves abstracted as objects. Processes communicate among each other using these shared objects — by updating the state of the objects as and when needed.\n\nAn object, when deposited into a space, needs to be registered with an \"Object Directory\" in the \"Object Space\". Any processes can then identify the object from the \"Object Directory\", using properties lookup, where the property specifying the criteria for the lookup of the object is its name or some other property which uniquely identifies it. A process may choose to wait for an object to be placed in the \"Object Space\", if the needed object is not already present.\n\nObjects, when deposited in an \"Object Space\" are passive, i.e., their methods cannot be invoked while the objects are in the \"Object Space\". Instead, the accessing process must \"retrieve\" it from the \"Object Space\" into its local memory, use the service provided by the object, update the state of the object and place it back into the \"Object Space\".\n\nThis paradigm inherently provides mutual exclusion. Because once an object is accessed, it has to be removed from the \"Object Space\", and is placed back only after it has been released. This means that no other process can access an object while it is being used by one process, thereby ensuring mutual exclusion.\n\nJavaSpaces is a service specification providing a distributed object exchange and coordination mechanism (which may or may not be persistent) for Java objects. It is used to store the distributed system state and implement distributed algorithms. In a JavaSpace, all communication partners (peers) communicate and coordinate by sharing state.\n\nJavaSpaces can be used to achieve scalability through parallel processing, it can also be used to provide reliable storage of objects through distributed replication, although this won't survive a total power failure like a disk; it is regarded by many to be reliable as long as the power is reliable. Distribution can also be to remote locations; however, this is rare as JavaSpaces are usually used for low-latency, high-performance applications rather than reliable object caching.\n\nThe most common software pattern used in JavaSpaces is the Master-Worker pattern. The Master hands out units of work to the \"space\", and these are read, processed and written back to the space by the workers. In a typical environment there are several \"spaces\", several masters and many workers; the workers are usually designed to be generic, i.e. they can take any unit of work from the space and process the task.\n\nJavaSpaces is part of the Java Jini technology, which on its own has not been a commercial success. The technology has found and kept new users over the years and some vendors are offering JavaSpaces-based products. JavaSpaces remains a niche technology mostly used in the financial services and telco industries where it continues to maintain a faithful following. The announcement of Jini/JavaSpaces created quite some hype although Sun co-founder and chief Jini architect Bill Joy put it straight that this distributed systems dream will take \"\"a quantum leap in thinking\"\".\n\nThe following example shows an application made using JavaSpaces. First, an object to be shared in the \"Object Space\" is made. Such an object is called an \"Entry\" in JavaSpace terminology. Here, the \"Entry\" is used to encapsulate a service which returns a \"Hello World!\" string, and keeps track of how many times it was used. The server which provides this service will create an \"Object Space\", or \"JavaSpace\". The \"Entry\" is then \"written\" into the \"JavaSpace\". The client \"reads\" the entry from the \"JavaSpace\" and invokes its method to access the service, updating its usage count by doing so. The updated \"Entry\" is written back to the \"JavaSpace\".\n// An Entry class\npublic class SpaceEntry implements Entry {\n\n// Hello World! server\npublic class Server {\n\n// Client\npublic class Client {\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed to that office in 1960, when Niger gained independence. Although corruption was a common feature of his administration, he gained international respect for his role as a spokesman for African affairs and as a popular arbitrator in conflicts. His rule ended with a coup in 1974.\n\nBorn in Soudouré, near the capital, Niamey, Diori was the son of a public health officer in the French colonial administration. He attended William Ponty Teachers' Training College in Dakar, Senegal, and worked as a teacher in Niger from 1936 to 1938, then became a Hausa and Djerma foreign language instructor at the Institute of Study Abroad, in Paris.\n\nIn 1946, while working as the headmaster of a school in Niger’s capital city of Niamey, he became one of the founders of the Nigerien Progressive Party (PPN), a regional branch of the African Democratic Rally (RDA). Later that year, he was elected to the French National Assembly. In the 1951 election, Diori was defeated by his cousin and political rival Djibo Bakary. He was again elected to the assembly in 1956, and was chosen deputy-speaker.\n\nIn 1958, after a referendum that granted Niger self-government, Diori became president of the provisional government. He then became Prime Minister of the republic in 1959. During this period, the French government banned all political parties except the PPN, effectively making Niger a one-party state.\n\nNiger gained independence from France on 3 August 1960 and Diori was elected president by the country's national assembly in November 1960. Organizing a powerful coalition of Hausa, Fula, and (most prominently) Djerma leaders, including chiefs and traditionalists, in support of Niger’s independence referendum, Diori gained French favor.\n\nSoon after independence, Diori made the PPN to be the only legally permitted party. His government favored the maintenance of traditional social structures and the retention of close economic ties with France. From the early 1960s, he ruled through a small number of pre-independence figures who sat on the PPN Politburo and largely bypassed even the cabinet. In addition to being both president of the republic and president of the PPN, Diori directly led a number of Ministries. From 1960 to 1963 he served as his own defence minister and foreign minister, and again took over the Foreign Ministry from 1965 to 1967. Most prominent, and perhaps most powerful, among Diori's advisers was writer and President of the National Assembly of Niger, Boubou Hama, who one writer has called the \"eminence grise\" behind Diori's rule. The National Assembly of Niger met in largely ceremonial yearly sittings to ratify government positions. Traditional notables, elected as parliamentary representatives, often unanimously endorsed government proposals. As president of the PPN, Diori was the only candidate for president of the republic, and as such was re-elected unopposed in 1965 and 1970.\n\nHe gained worldwide respect for his role as a spokesman for African affairs and as a popular arbitrator in conflicts involving other African nations. Domestically, however, his administration was rife with corruption, and the government was unable to implement much-needed reforms or to alleviate the widespread famine brought on by the Sahelian drought of the early 1970s. Increasingly criticized at home for his negligence in domestic matters, Diori put down a coup in December 1963, which occurred concurrently with a border dispute with the Republic of Dahomey. He also narrowly escaped assassination in 1965. Faced with an attempted military coup and attacks by members of Sawaba, he used French advisers and troops to strengthen his rule. Close links with France lead to student and union protests against what they described as \"French neocolonialism\". However, his relationship with France suffered when his government voiced dissatisfaction with the level of investment in uranium production when Georges Pompidou visited Niger in 1972.\n\nWidespread civil disorder followed allegations that some government ministers were misappropriating stocks of food aid and accused Diori of consolidating power. Diori limited cabinet appointments to fellow Djerma, family members, and close friends. In addition, he acquired new powers by declaring himself the minister of foreign and defense affairs. On 15 April 1974, Lieutenant colonel Seyni Kountché led a military coup that ended Diori's rule. He was imprisoned for six years. After his release in 1980, he remained under house arrest until 1987.\n\nAfter being released from house arrest, he moved to Morocco, where he died on 23 April 1989 at the age of 72.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966262", "title": "Golden Ambrosian Republic", "text": "Golden Ambrosian Republic\n\nThe Golden Ambrosian Republic (; ; 1447–1450) was a short-lived government founded in Milan by members of the University of Pavia with popular support, during the first phase of the Milanese War of Succession. With the aid of Francesco Sforza they held out against the forces of the Republic of Venice, but after a betrayal Sforza defected and captured Milan to become Duke himself, abolishing the Republic.\n\nWhen Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, died on 13 August 1447, the city was thrown into confusion by his unexpected demise and the speed with which claimants to his title acted. Filippo Maria had no heir through male bloodlines, but the day before his death he had written a will bequeathing the Duchy to Alfonso V of Aragon. Among the other claimants were Charles, Duke of Orléans, nephew of Filippo Maria through his half-sister Valentina Visconti; Filippo's cousins Albert and Sigismund of the House of Habsburg, great-grandsons of Bernabò Visconti; and Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who declared that the Duchy reverted to the Holy Roman Empire on the extinction of its male heirs. The two most prominent candidates supported by the Milanese population were however Alfonso of Aragon and Francesco Sforza, the Duke's son-in-law by marriage to his illegitimate daughter, Bianca Maria Visconti. The Bracceschi family, supporters of the King of Aragon, seized the Castello on the night of the 13th, almost before Filippo Maria died, forcing the captains to swear allegiance to Alfonso.\n\nDespite the general support for either Alfonso or Sforza, other influential citizens believed that the old republic could be restored. Learned bodies, such as the College of Jurisprudence in Pavia, painted the days of the old republic as a golden age. The merchants, seeing the prosperity of Republican Venice, supported this idea. On the morning of the 14th, Republicans stirred the populace to rise against the Bracceschi, under the leadership of Antonio Trivulzio (seniore), Giorgio Lampugnano, Innocenzo Cotta, and Teodoro Bossi, members of the College of Jurisprudence. A republic was declared behind the Palace of the Commune, and the captains abandoned their oaths to Alfonso in favor of it. The Bracceschi were driven from Milan, and the new republic was called the Golden Ambrosian Republic, after St. Ambrose, the 4th century bishop of Milan, who was adopted as the Republic's patron. They took the old constitution and revised it that same day to suit their needs, electing twenty-four \"Capitani e difensori della libertà\", or \"Captains and Defenders of Liberty,\" to frame laws, elected regularly and later reduced to twelve.\n\nThe idea of a radical renewal of liberties in the cities did not suit the powers of North Italy, who had been in league against Visconti territorial gains in a decades-long series of wars interrupted by truces, most recently the Peace of Cremona of 20 November 1441. Venice was already at war with Milan, and the Republic was struck a sore blow as previously Milanese cities including Pavia, Lodi, and Piacenza defected or declared their independence. Besides the loss of support and defensive locations, the drop in revenue also caused a brief financial crisis resolved by the imposition of new taxes. Venice, now occupying Lodi and Piacenza, refused to listen to Milan's pleas for peace. Milan turned to Francesco Sforza, the greatest military leader of his day, offering him the position of Captain-General and the city of Brescia. Although he wished – and indeed, planned – to succeed his father-in-law as Duke, he decided to accept the position and promised rewards. A draft was declared in Milan on 13 September.\n\nSforza quickly captured independent Pavia when his mother-in-law persuaded the city's ruling condotierro to relinquish it to him, and the Republic grudgingly allowed him to keep it with the title of Count, fearing that the Pavians and their large arsenal might instead offer themselves to Venice if they refused. Sforza promised the Pavians no new taxes, respect for the old laws, payment for the officials he retained, and the repair of the city bridges and walls. He kept these promises faithfully and so won over the people of Pavia, establishing his rule. Pavia was previously almost a second capital to Milan, and gave Sforza his own seat of power. The city was also in a strategic location on the Po River, situated where it could block the Venetians from coming to the relief of the beleaguered Piacenza by water. Returning to the siege of Piacenza and finding the city not likely to crumble by starvation, he resolved to storm it. Employing cannon in an almost unheard-of manner, he opened up a breach in Piacenza's walls and sacked the city. The news of Piacenza's sack was greeted by three days' rejoicing in Milan. Meanwhile, Milanese Captain Bartolomeo Colleoni captured Tortona which had previously proclaimed Sforza as its lord, stealing it from the now dangerously powerful Sforza. This caused even greater rejoicing, for the Milanese feared Sforza.\n\nIn January 1448, the terms of the previous Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.\n\nUltimately both Sforza's Milanese forces and the Venetian army under Micheletto Attendolo met at Caravaggio. The siege remained unbroken throughout July and until 15 September, when Attendolo launched a surprise-attack on Sforza, so rapidly that he did not even have time to buckle on his armor. What might have been a rout Sforza turned into a great victory as he set the example for his troops on the front line and utterly defeated the Venetian army, capturing three generals. Caravaggio fell, and despite rejoicing in Milan, little gratitude was given by the government to the architect of the victory, and the Republic sent him on to Lodi, determined to end the war. It was here, when a satisfactory end to the war seemed imminent, that the Milanese took a fatal misstep.\n\nIn Milan, Sforza's enemies worked continually against him. The Piccinino brothers, sons of famous condottiere Niccolò Piccinino and former Captains-General before being replaced as supreme military commanders by Sforza, convinced the suspicious Republic to work secretly against Sforza. Rumors were spread among the troops about not receiving payment at the end of the war if they remained with Sforza, and Sforza himself was ordered back from the siege of Brescia, the city promised to him, while the citizens were secretly told to hold out until peace, already in the works, was signed. Sforza learned of this treachery and defected to the Venetians for 13,000 ducats and the Duchy of Milan in return for the Ghiaradadda, Crema, and his service. The treaty was signed on 18 October 1448, and Sforza now undid everything he had labored for over the past year. With such a powerful man on the Venetian side, it was the beginning of the end of the Golden Ambrosian Republic. Public opinion, despite the government's position, was generally pro-Sforza, and only an impassioned, patriotic speech from Giorgio Lampugnano subdued it at last. The Piccinino brothers became Captains-General once more, but were not as capable as the brilliant Sforza.\nThis was reinforced by the internal dissension that was prominent in Milan. Crime and mob violence were rampant, and the harsh but empty measures against it only served to further divide the populace. Members of the government were filled with suspicion against one another. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the podestà was given absolute power. Financial problems were also grave; fines, confiscations, and a state lottery were instituted to try to alleviate the deficit. Moreover, Guelph aristocrats continued to be regularly elected over the Ghibellines, and began to make the Republic far less democratic. Carlo Gonzaga, Captain of the People, lived luxuriously as an autocrat with his will as law. He was supported by Giovanni Appiani and Giovanni Ossona, tradesmen-turned-politicians, who were prominent in government affairs. Gonzaga began replacing his officials with his unambitious supporters, and the Ghibellines saw the ideals of their Republic crumbling before their eyes. Lampugnano and his Ghibelline friends conspired against Gonzaga and the Guelph regime, but were exposed by a letter intercepted by Gonzaga from Lampugnano to his friend Bossi. Gonzaga kept this knowledge secret, knowing that Lampugnano and Bossi were two of the most influential citizens since the formation of the Republic, but with the support of the vengeful Guelph Captains and Defenders conspired to have them slain. Lampugnano and Bossi were sent as envoys to Frederick III in February 1449, but on the road were caught and imprisoned. Lampugnano was beheaded without a trial, and Bossi was tortured until he gave the names of his fellow conspirators. Following the execution of the leaders there was a massacre of leading Ghibellines within the city, from which only a few, such as Vitaliano Borromeo, escaped to safety in Arona, Piedmont and elsewhere. The heads of the slain were placed upon pikes in the Piazza of the Broletto.\n\nMeanwhile, the other claimants to the Duchy began to see that Sforza would be a greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added with the fact that he rashly accepted the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.\n\nLampugnano, unfortunately for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse by the fact that the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.\n\nSforza was coming close to Milan itself in his conquests, and decided that since it was too powerful to be taken by force, he would surround it and starve the populace into surrender. With the loss of the outer cities by conquest or defection, Milan experienced famine. Gonzaga offered Crema to Sforza, hoping he would be tempted to take it himself and betray the Venetians. But Sforza remained staunch, and instead offered Gonzaga the city of Tortona if he would abandon Crema. This was accepted, and Crema, without support, quickly capitulated. \n\nTo the Milanese, Sforza's victory now seemed certain, but he found his Venetian allies beginning to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza would be far more dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.\n\nSforza chose for his headquarters the Borromeo castle of Peschiera, south-east of the city. Starvation and suffering were rampant in Milan, and the Venetians had sent an ambassador, Leonardo Venieri, to negotiate the city's surrender and help them defeat Sforza. At last, Gaspare da Vimercate and several members of the Stampa family engineered a coup on 24 February 1450, which resulted in the murder of Venieri on the stairs of Palazzo Reale. The next day the citizens met and Da Vimercate convinced the people to surrender to Sforza. Sforza had made himself very popular for his generosity while fighting for Milan. He had abstained from ravaging the countryside as was so common among commanders of his day, and after some debate the public was convinced. The following day terms were offered to Sforza, who accepted them. Sforza earned the city's devotion by distributing food to the starving people. On 22 March 1450, he had himself declared \"capitano del popolo\", and by right of his wife, the Duke of Milan. He secured his popular support by letting many office-holders keep their positions and being very lenient in his reprisals. The leaders were briefly imprisoned or relegated to their estates, but were generally pardoned soon after, even knighting some of his old enemies at his coronation. Ghibellines were allowed to return in safety and were restored to favor.\n\nSforza remained at war with Venice for years after the downfall of the Ambrosian Republic. Venice allied herself with the Kingdom of Naples, previously a contender for the succession of Milan. Sforza, however, allied himself with his friend, Cosimo de' Medici of Florence against Venice and Aragonese Naples. The continued war was finally concluded by the peace of Lodi in 1454 with the House of Sforza established as the rulers of the Duchy of Milan\n\nDuring its three-year existence, the Ambrosian Republic won two major battles. The Lombards defeated the French at the Battle of Bosco Marengo in 1447 and the Venetians at the Battle of Caravaggio in 1448. It was those victories that assured the Republic all the territory of the former Duchy.\n\nOf the Republic, Niccolò Machiavelli remarked \n\nThe leading magistrates of the city, the \"capitani e defensori\" (\"Captains and Defenders\"), were in charge of the government, elected every six months beginning in August 1447. They originally numbered twenty-four but were eventually reduced to twelve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The band's first show was on Valentine's Day at My Fair Lady Club, in Detroit, opening for the New MC5 in 1977. They were influenced by 1950s American rock and roll, Detroit's MC5, the Stooges, early Bob Seger, Motown R&B, 1960s North American garage rock as well as the British Invasion rockers.\n\nThe Romantics achieved popularity in the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, and Australia on the strength of the band's well-crafted pop songs, high energy shows, and their look: from black vinyl to red leather suits in their music videos, inspired by the Motown artists The Temptations and the Four Tops. Their two best-charting songs were \"What I Like About You\", which peaked at #49 in the US and #2 in Australia, and \"Talking in Your Sleep\", which peaked at #3 in the US, #1 in Canada, and #14 in Australia. The two have since become mainstays on '80s, classic rock, AOR, and active rock radio stations.\nTheir debut album, released on January 4, 1980 in the UK, has the distinction of being the first record to be released of that decade.\n\nThe Romantics' original lineup consisted of lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and harmonicist Wally Palmar, lead guitarist and vocalist Mike Skill, bassist and backing vocalist Rich Cole, and drummer and lead vocalist Jimmy Marinos. All four band members made songwriting contributions to the group, but Palmar and Skill were considered the band's primary tunesmiths. For three years the band was on the road, playing in East Coast and Midwestern venues like Boston's Rathskeller, CBGB in New York's Bowery, Manhattan's Max's Kansas City, and Cleveland's Agora. They were subsequently signed to Nat Weiss' Nemperor record label after a show at Hurrahs, and in September 1979, the band recorded their debut self-titled album with British producer Pete Solley. The group's true record debut was the 1978 single on Spider Records, \"Little White Lies\" (b/w \"I Can't Tell You Anything\"), followed that year by the Bomp! single \"Tell It to Carrie\" (b/w \"First in Line\"). All of these were re-recorded later for the first LP.\n\nThe album sold roughly 200,000 copies and yielded the hit \"What I Like About You\", which reached #49 in the US, #8 in the Netherlands, and #2 in Australia, where the band was especially popular. As all four members were singers, the straightforward beat of \"What I Like About You\" lent the opportunity for drummer Jimmy Marinos to take the vocals.\n\nMike Skill left the band after the release of its second album, \"National Breakout\", in 1980. He was replaced by lead guitarist Coz Canler. This lineup of the band recorded the album \"Strictly Personal\" in 1981 with producer Mike Stone, who had produced for Queen. Due to frustrations with the songwriting featured on the record, Rich Cole was replaced by a returning Skill, who took over as the band's bassist.\n\nWith Skill back in, the band began playing arenas with the likes of Cheap Trick, the Kinks, and the Cars. Solley was also rehired in 1983 as their producer for their fourth album \"In Heat.\" \"In Heat\" would be The Romantics' greatest commercial success, and was awarded a gold album in the United States for selling over 500,000 copies. It eventually would sell over 900,000 US copies. \"In Heat\" was also awarded a gold album in Canada (for over 50,000 copies sold). The first single taken from \"In Heat\", \"Talking in Your Sleep\", hit #3 for four weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and reached #1 on the Album Rock Tracks and Hot Dance Club Play charts.\n\nIt was also a global success, scoring in many other countries such as #1 in Canada and #5 in Sweden. A second single, \"One In A Million\", peaked at #37 during the following year on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart and also went to #21 on the Hot Dance Club Play Chart. The Romantics' music videos were frequently shown on the cable television network MTV during this period, solidifying the band's popularity. Also during 1983, the Romantics played US and international concert tours in support of \"In Heat\", and appeared on such pop music-themed television shows as \"Solid Gold\", \"American Bandstand\", and \"Soul Train\".\n\nIn 1984, drummer Jimmy Marinos left the Romantics, and he was replaced by David Petratos, who would serve as the band's drummer until 1990. This lineup released one album, 1985s \"Rhythm Romance\", which peaked at #72 and only produced one charting single (\"Test of Time\" #71). Detroit keyboardist Barry Warner was also added to the band for the following 1985–1986 tour. Due to the tour for \"Rhythm Romance\" being thwarted by low ticket sales and mounting tension between the band and its management, The Romantics were dropped from the Sony record label.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Romantics discovered that their managers had been misappropriating the profits earned by the band from its records and live performances. Additionally, one of their releases (the aforementioned \"What I Like About You\") had been licensed for use in television commercials without the band's knowledge or approval. Consequently, the Romantics filed a lawsuit against their management in 1987, and the legalities involved prevented the band from recording new music until the mid-1990s.\n\nFormer Blondie drummer Clem Burke replaced David Petratos as the Romantics' drummer in 1990. For much of the 1990s, the Romantics played obscure performances in small venues, largely forgotten and out of the public spotlight.\n\nThe Romantics' fortunes began to rise again in the middle of the 1990s, as the band's success in its lawsuit against its former management freed the band to record again (and ensured that future earnings from the licensing of Romantics songs would go to the band). The first fruit of the band's new recording activity was the 1993 UK-only EP \"Made In Detroit\". Several Romantics greatest hits packages were issued during the 1990s, as was the live album \"The King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents: The Romantics Live In Concert\", a 1996 release of an October 1983 recording of a Romantics concert in San Antonio, Texas at the height of the band's popularity.\n\nJimmy Marinos, the Romantics' original drummer, temporarily returned to the band for a series of performances in 1996–1997 (with Clem Burke returning to the Romantics' drumstool after Marinos departed again). In 2003, twenty years after the release of their most commercially successful album, \"In Heat\", the Romantics released \"61/49\"–a more roots rock and blues-oriented record than the band's previous efforts. Although Clem Burke performed as the band's primary drummer on the release, original drummer Jimmy Marinos is featured on half of the tracks. The album was not a great commercial success, but won the Romantics a newfound critical respect that they had not enjoyed during their popular and commercial heyday in the early 1980s. \"61/49\" also offered proof that despite the band's years out of the public spotlight, the Romantics remain a potent musical unit.\n\nA fourth drummer, Brad Elvis, (formerly from The Elvis Brothers, and currently The Handcuffs) replaced Clem Burke as the Romantics' regular drummer in 2004 after Burke returned full-time to a reactivated Blondie. The Romantics continue to play live concerts today.\n\nRich Cole returned to the band after a long absence in 2010. Longtime lead guitarist Coz Canler left the band in 2011, allowing Skill to return to the original lead guitarist role he held in the band.\n\nIn 2004, the band's album \"61/49\" was named most Outstanding National Small/Independent Label Album at the Detroit Music Awards, and in June 2011, the Romantics were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.\n\nOn November 21, 2007, The Romantics filed a lawsuit against Activision, RedOctane, Harmonix, and Wavegroup Sound over the cover of the song \"What I Like About You\" used in \"\". While the game developers did secure appropriate rights to cover the song in the game, The Romantics claim that the cover is \"virtually indistinguishable from the authentic version\" and thus would \"[confuse] consumers into believing that the band actually recorded the music and endorsed the product\". The lawsuit requested the cessation of sales of the game and monetary damage.\n\nA summary judgment hearing was held on July 9, 2008, and the case was dismissed the next month, with U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds stating that Activision had obtained the proper licensing for the works and that the band itself no longer held the copyright on the work.\n\nFormer\n\n"}

When a train traverses a turnout in a facing direction, it may diverge onto either of the two routes. When travelled in a trailing direction, the two routes converge onto each other.\n\nIn the early history of railways in Britain, when signalling and interlocking were primitive, and staff were inexperienced, facing turnouts were a hazard, because a train travelling at high speed could be accidentally switched into a slow speed divergence or dead end. Facing turnouts were therefore banned, except when absolutely necessary. However, facing turnouts cannot be avoided where there are crossing loops on single lines.\n\nWith the widespread availability of electrically-interlocked signalling in modern times, the rule against facing turnouts has been relaxed.\n\nFixed diamond crossings (with no moving parts) count as trailing points in both directions, although in very exceptional circumstances such as propelling a train in reverse over fine angle diamond crossings they can derail wagons as they bunch up.\n\nSwitched diamonds, which contain two stub turnouts in disguise, count as facing turnouts in both directions and are also known as moveable angles (UK).\n\nFixed V-crossings are trailable in both directions. Moveable crossings are effectively facing in both directions and must be correctly aligned.\n\nStub switches are effectively facing in both directions and must be correctly aligned.\n\nDouble junctions are now configurable in a number of different ways, whereby the number of facing and trailing turnouts vary.\n\nThe goods siding on a double line (in the above diagram) uses two trailing points and a diamond.

After periods on various boats he was posted to the submarine service. He was captured in 1940 in Amsterdam by advancing German forces.\n\nInitially sent to a prison camp at Soest, Germany, Steinmetz was then transferred to a POW camp Silesia. He refused to sign a German parole saying he would refrain from any hostile act towards Germany and was transferred to Sonderlager IVC, at Colditz Castle.\n\nAt Colditz all Dutch escapes were coordinated by the Dutch escape officer Captain Machiel van den Heuvel, known as \"Vandy\" by the British. Van den Heuvel quickly recognised the possibilities of the exercise park and soon had his first escape plan ready. On 15 August 1941 Steinmetz and Hans Larive hid under a manhole cover under the cover of a rugby scrum. Lieutenant Gerrit Dames then created a diversion by cutting a hole in the barbed wire fence, before allowing himself to be caught, shouting to imaginary escapers to run, so that the Germans would think that the missing officers had already escaped.\n\nLarive and Steinmetz hid for several hours. The cover was fixed with a heavy bolt, which Van den Heuvel had replaced with a fake made of glass. Once it was dark the two men forced the manhole cover open from below, and replaced the now broken glass bolt with the original one. They then made their way out of the castle. (This escape method was repeated on 20 September 1941 by two other Dutch officers, C. Giebel and O. L. Drijber.). At Leisnig Steinmetz and Larive took a train to Nuremberg where they waited for their next train in a nearby park. To avoid attracting unwanted attention, they pretended to be a courting couple, with Steinmetz pulling a blanket down over his shorts so it looked like a skirt. They crossed the Swiss border on 18 August 1941.\n\nUnder Swiss neutrality law they were not allowed to leave the country, so the Dutch Legation provided false papers describing them as sugar planters on their way to Cuba. They travelled on a sealed train in which neutrals were able to pass through France into Spain. At Barcelona they boarded the neutral ship, \"Isla de Teneriffe\", sailing for Havana. The ship was intercepted by a Royal Navy cutter in the Strait of Gibraltar and the two men were taken off and arrived in Gibraltar on 4 November. They then sailed to England aboard the submarine HNLMS \"O 21\" and arrived in London on 17 December 1941.\n\nAfter interrogation by the British, Steinmetz served on motor torpedo boats, taking MTB 222 to the West Indies. He later commanded Dutch motor torpedo boats in the Far East.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Steinmetz returned to Holland and served at the naval training camp at Hilversum. In December 1950, he commanded the minesweeper \"Boereo\" in Dutch New Guinea, before returning to the naval training centre at Voorschoten.\n\nSteinmetz later commanded the minesweeper \"De Bitter\" and the frigate \"De Zeeuw\", before joining the Dutch Ministry of Naval Affairs. His final ship was the destroyer \"Limburg\".\n\nAfter retiring, Steinmetz worked for Ole Anderson in Denmark, making fan impellers.\n\nSteinmetz married twice, first in 1946 to Regina Henrietta Noren (until her death in 1974); and then Peggy George, who predeceased him. He had one son during his first marriage; and two step-daughters by his second.\n\n"}

They are highly expressed in platelets, and also on endothelial cells, myocytes and neurons.\n\nThere are four mammalian members of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family: PAR1 - encoded by the gene F2R, PAR2 - F2RL1, PAR3 - F2RL2 and PAR4 - F2RL3, all these genes have their locus on chromosome 5 except of PAR4, which is on chromosome 19. They are also members of the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, and are expressed throughout the body.\n\nPAR1 was firstly described in 1991 on human platelets as a thrombin receptor. In 1994 another member of this family was discovered, S. Nystedt named it simply proteinase activated receptor 2. Experiments on F2R knockout mice then led to the discovery of PAR3 and PAR4.\n\nProtease activated receptors are integral membrane proteins that are coupled to G-proteins and are activated by specific cleavage of the amino terminal sequence that exposes a new N-terminal sequence functions as a tethered ligand, which bind a conserved region on extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Such bound causes the specific change in conformation of the PAR and alters the affinity for intracellular G-protein. Four types of PAR receptors have been identified by molecular cloning, and classified according to the main enzyme that is able to activate it. It has been determined that a large group of proteases cleave and activate PARs receptors, including various endogenous proteases from: a) the coagulation cascade, b) inflammatory cells, and c) the digestive tract. On the other hand PARs can be specifically cleaved and irreversibly activated even by exogenous proteases originated from insects, bacteria or plants and fungi. The wide distribution of PARs in a variety of cells supports the idea that they are involved in many process related with the gastrointestinal physiology. Although the proteolysis is the main mechanism for PAR activation, it is well known that a synthetic peptide (SLIGKV) that mimics the new N-terminal sequence produced after the cleavage, activates PAR-2 receptors without its proteolytic processing. In this sense, here we report that TFF3 isolated from human breast milk activates PAR-2 receptors of intestinal epithelial cells HT-29. These findings suggest that TFF3 activates intestinal epithelial cells through G-protein-coupled PAR-2, and could actively participate in the immune system of breastfed babies inducing the production of peptides related to innate defense, such as defensins and cytokines.\n\nPARs are activated by the action of serine proteases such as thrombin (acts on PARs 1, 3 and 4) and trypsin (PAR 2). These enzymes cleave the N-terminus of the receptor, which in turn acts as a tethered ligand. In the cleaved state, part of the receptor itself acts as the agonist, causing a physiological response.\n\nMost of the PAR family act through the actions of G-proteins i (cAMP inhibitory), 12/13 (Rho and Ras activation) and q (calcium signalling) to cause cellular actions.\n\nThe cellular effects of thrombin are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PARs). Thrombin signalling in platelets contributes to hemostasis and thrombosis. Endothelial PARs participate in the regulation of vascular tone and permeability while in vascular smooth muscle they mediate contraction, proliferation, and hypertrophy. In endothelial cells PARs play a key role in promotion vascular barrier function as they provide a positive signals for endothelial adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1), and E-selectin). PARs contribute to the pro-inflammatory response. For example PAR4 induces leukocyte migration and PAR2 helps macrophages to produce cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). Recent research has also implicated these novel receptors in muscle growth and bone cell differentiation and proliferation.\n\n\n"}

On the sixth day O'Shea was released when the fines were paid by a man who claimed to have won the New South Wales lottery.\n\nOver the previous five years, the Tramways Union had militantly defended and improved the conditions of its members. The union had accumulated 40 fines totalling $13,200 imposed on it by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Due to the inaction of Melbourne Trades Hall, twenty seven left wing unions had caucused together in response to the perceived attacks on unionism by the widespread application of fines. They called a mass delegates meeting for the day of the hearing that was attended by 5,000 delegates. After the meeting the delegates marched to the courthouse led by Clarrie O'Shea. \n\nIn court O'Shea refused to take the oath, then refused to present the union books, in line with the wishes of the members of his union, and was formally arrested and sentenced for contempt of court on Thursday 15 May 1969 and taken to HM Prison Pentridge. This led to immediate walk outs on the Thursday, and a general strike which paralysed Victoria on the Friday. There were two 24-hour stoppages in Victoria, involving 40 unions. All trains and trams stopped, delivery of goods was severely restricted, the power supply was cut and TV and radio broadcasts were disrupted. Protests and strike action also occurred in regional Victoria with the Geelong Trades Hall Council supporting the strikes and similar action in Bendigo, Ballarat, and the Latrobe Valley.\n\nAll together, about 500,000 workers struck across Australia on Friday, 16 May. The Trades and Labour Council of WA, the Queensland Trades and Labour Council and the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia all called statewide general strikes. In Queensland, mass meetings or strikes occurred in 20 cities, while Trades and Labour Councils in Newcastle, Wollongong and Canberra called out members of affiliated unions. The Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council also refused to sanction any action, while 22 'rebel' affiliated unions representing 50,000 workers (80% of Tasmania's workforce) organized a general stoppage. \n\nProtests calling for O'Shea's release occurred outside HM Prison Pentridge in Coburg over the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday 20 May, Dudley MacDougall, a former advertising manager for the Australian Financial Review, acting on \"behalf of a public benefactor\", paid the union's fines. Kerr ordered O'Shea to be released. Although the penal laws were not repealed, they have never been used again.\n\n\n"}

Steeped in British Army traditions, the Malaysian Army does not carry the title ‘royal’ () as do the Royal Malaysian Air Force and the Royal Malaysian Navy. Instead, the title is bestowed on selected army corps and regiments who have been accorded the honour by the \"Yang di-Pertuan Agong\" ('The King of Malaysia'), who is the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces.\n\nThe first military units in Malaysia can be traced back to the Penang Volunteer Rifle raised on 1 March 1861, and the Malay States Volunteer Rifles which existed from 1915 to 1936. The birth of the modern Malaysian Army came about when the Federal Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. This allowed the initial recruitment of 25 males for the First Experimental Malay Company on 1 March 1933. Major G. McI. S. Bruce of the Lincolnshire Regiment was the first Commanding Officer. By 1 January 1935, the Experimental Company became The Malay Regiment with a complement of 150 men. A battalion was formed on 1 January 1938 and eventually a second battalion on 1 December 1941. The 1st Bn Malay Regiment was famous for its defence of Opium Hill or \"Bukit Chandu\" in Singapore. The ‘Battle of Opium Hill’ on 14 February 1942 involved 42 soldiers commanded by Lt. Adnan Saidi who defended their position against attack from the 18th Division of the Japanese Imperial Army under Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi. After World War II and during the Malayan Emergency, the number of battalions was increased to seven in the early 1950s.\n\nThe \"Kor Armor Diraja\" ('Royal Armoured Corps') can trace its roots to the formation on 1 September 1952 of the Federation Reconnaissance Squadron. It was later merged with the Federation Regiment to form the Federation Reconnaissance Corps. The name underwent a few transformations from the Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps (16 September 1967), Royal Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps (May 1979) to Royal Cavalry Corps (December 1979) and finally to \"Kor Armor Diraja\" on 8 December 1986. The Royal Ranger Regiment's lineage began in 1863 as the paramilitary Sarawak Rangers. Although the second in the order of precedence, it is the oldest active formation of the Army.\n\nThe flag of Malaysian Army has been introduced since the inception of Malaysia Army and has been in use till today. The shape of it is the combination of Malaysian Flag and Malaysian Army's crest. This flag is the symbol of pride and courageousness of the Malaysian Army.\n\nThe flag dimension is (height) and (wide). The flags are being flown from 6.30 am to 6.30 pm everyday based on certain protocol and honor.\n\nThe Malaysian Army currently has 18 Corps and Regiments. These are grouped into 3 main components — the Combat Element, the Combat Support Element and the Support Elements.\n\nThe Corps and Regiments are currently organised into five divisions. Three of which (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions) are based on the Malay Peninsula and placed under Western Field Army Headquarters, while the other two (the 1st Division and 5th Division) are based on Malaysian Borneo and placed under Eastern Field Army Headquarters.\n\nThe 21st Special Service Group (the Army's special forces), 10th Parachute Brigade and the two Army Aviation Regiment are independent formations.\n\nThe Western Field Army Headquarters, Eastern Field Army Headquarters and two support commands (Army Training and Doctrine Headquarters, and Army Logistics Administration Headquarters) are placed under Army Headquarters (Army Command).\n\nThe current Chief of Army () is General Dato’ Seri Panglima Ahmad Hasbullah Mohd Nawawi, who succeeded General Tan Sri Zulkiple Hj Kassim on 3 September 2018.\n\nThe Malaysian Army uses a rank structure inherited from the British Army. The Malaysian Army rank structure has 17 levels from Private (\"Prebet\") to General (\"Jeneral\"). These ranks are divided into 2 main groups — Officer (\"Pegawai\") and Other Ranks (\"Lain-Lain Pangkat\") which includes the Non-Commissioned Officer (\"Pegawai Tidak Tauliah — PTT\") ranks.\n\n\n\nThe \"Rejimen Askar Melayu Diraja\" ('Royal Malay Regiment') is the most senior regiment of the Malaysian Army. Its ranks are recruited from amongst the Malay population. The Regiment has 26 battalions. The 1st Battalion, the most senior in the Regiment, currently undertakes ceremonial and Royal Guard duties. The remainder are configured as 19 Standard Infantry Battalions, three Mechanised Infantry Battalions and three Parachute Infantry Battalions. The regiment uses rifle green berets except the three airborne battalions that wear maroon berets.\n\nThe 19th Bn Royal Malay Regiment (Mech) was involved in the rescue of U.S. 75th Ranger Regiment and Delta Force operatives in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu. The unit of 32 Radpanzer Condor APCs and 113 men from MALBATT 1 went in with the U.S. 10th Mountain Division to rescue the trapped Rangers. Four APCs were immobilised and were destroyed by US helicopter gunships. 19 Royal Malay Regiment suffered 1 soldier killed in action (KIA), PFC Mat Aznan Awang while 8 others were wounded in action (WIA). PFC Mat Aznan Awang was later promoted posthumously to Corporal and was awarded with \"Pingat Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa\", the nation's highest gallantry award. In total, 7 officers and 26 NCOs were awarded various medals for their valour during the operation, the highest number of men recommended for medals in a single unit in a single operation.\n\nThe \"Rejimen Renjer Diraja\" ('Royal Ranger Regiment') is a multi-racial unit organised along similar lines to the \"Rejimen Askar Melayu Diraja\". There are currently 10 battalions within this regiment. The Regiment traces its roots to the Sarawak Rangers and the Sarawak Constabulary, famed jungle trackers who had a deadly reputation during the Malayan Emergency and during the Communist Party of Malaya’s insurgency in Malaysia. The 8th Bn Royal Ranger Regiment (8 Renjer) was the first infantry battalion in the Malaysian Army to undergo conversion into an airborne battalion. The unit is currently assigned to the elite 10th Parachute Brigade. The Malaysian Army's most decorated soldier, WOI (Rtd) Kanang anak Langkau was a Regimental Sergeant Major of 8 Ranger.\n\nThe \"Rejimen Sempadan\" ('Border Regiment') is a newly created regiment from the 300 series Territorial Army units in charge of the border. The Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister, Najib Razak, announced on 1 July 2006 the formation of a new regiment specifically for border patrol. Members of the regiment will be taken from various regiments and corps, most notably from the \"Rejimen Askar Wataniah\". It is believed that the army will form about 2 to 3 brigades of this new regiment. The new regiment was officially raised on 9 February 2008 by Najib Razak at Tanah Merah, Kelantan.\n\n\nThe \"Kor Armor Diraja\" \"('\"Royal Armoured Corps\"')\" provides the armour capability for the Malaysian Army. Currently, the Corps consists of 5 battalions (sometimes referred to as Regiments), which are equipped with various armoured personnel carriers (SIBMAS AFSV-90, Rheinmetall Condor, K-200 MIFV) and light combat vehicles. \"Rejimen ke-11\" of the \"Kor Armor Diraja\" is the sole user of 48 PT-91M Main Battle Tanks from Poland.\n\n\nThe \"Rejimen Artileri Diraja\" \"(\"'Royal Artillery Regiment\"')\" is the artillery corps of the Malaysian Army and provides artillery support and local air defence for army units. The regiment is equipped with 36 Brazilian-made Astros II multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and 28 G5 MkIII towed artillery guns from South Africa.

The first major procurement was to set a milestone by building its first ever main battle tank regiment. Malaysian Army received delivery of 48 PT-91M main battle tanks and other tank-based equipment, like ARV WZT-4 from Poland, fully completed contract of sale in March 2010. Despite adding some 28 units of South African G5 Mk III 155 mm howitzers, another major procurement was 18 units of Astros MLRS from Brazil, which delivery was completed in 2006. A second batch of 18 MRLS was ordered in 2007. Malaysian Army is also rapidly mechanising its current inventory - 267 Adnan IFVs (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) were acquired by the army in 2004 and 111 K200 KIFV also purchased. Following a more recent procurement of the Pakistani Bakhtar-Shikan Anti-armor missile launcher, these were installed on the Adnans.\n\nMalaysian Army is now shifting its emphasis on enhancing its air wing. In September 2006, Malaysian Army received its 11th and last Agusta-Westland A109H Light Utility Helicopter. These helicopters are to initially complement, and ultimately replace, the ageing SA316B Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopters. Six of them were to be installed with light arms and to be tasked to a scout observation unit; a sample was shown in LIMA 07. The configuration of the remainder is unclear. Furthermore, the army will also receive S61A-4 Nuri multipurpose helicopters after they are retired from RMAF; these will form the backbone of the army’s very first air transport units - 881 and 882 squadrons of the army air wing. In the same year, at the biannual Defence Services Asia (DSA) 2006, Malaysia announced that the US made M4 Carbine service rifle will replace the Austrian-made Steyr AUG service rifle for all three Malaysian Armed Forces services. The army will receive the new weapon soon.\n\nThere is also a requirement for an upgrade to the current air defence network. However, a dispute between the army and the air force on whether to introduce a mid-range SAM system had led to the procurement being put on hold. According to a recent interview of the army’s chief of staff, Ismail bin Haji Jamaluddin, the army has no intention of taking over the mid-range air defence role. To boost the security in eastern Sabah from the attacks by militants in the southern Philippines, especially in the Sulu Sea, the Malaysian government has purchased a total of six McDonnell Douglas MD 500 Defender light attack helicopters from the United States for the Malaysian Army. Around 200 AV-4 Lipanbara 4x4 armoured vehicles that was intended to be stationed in east Malaysia were also currently being built after an agreement with a Thai company. The United States were also reportedly will deliver a total of 29 M109 howitzer artillery to the Malaysian Army. Malaysian defence company, the Global Komited has partnered with British air defence company, Thales for the distribution of surface-to-air missile to the Malaysian Army. While another Malaysian company AVP Engineering has teamed up with a South Korean-defence company Doosan DST to offer Black Fox 6x6 wheeled armoured vehicle if it was selected by the Malaysian government. Malaysia also locally produce \nAV-8 Gempita 8x8 with technology assistance from Turkey. On October 2019, the contract and delivery of M109A5 to be canceled as the result the army has no interest anymore.\n\nThe Malaysian Army currently has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, as well as equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness up and down as well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.\nThe FSS in conjunction with the NCO (Network Centric Operation) System, will give the three branches of the Armed Forces a shared situational awareness and a common operating picture via a X-band satellite-based link and a UAV system, with hopes to enable self-synchronisation for all three branches. The programme will go through several phases, with Phasa 1A (the implementation of the Mobile X-band satellite communication linked) and Phase 2 (the demonstration of the capibilities of the NCO with FSS) being successful and operational in 2017. \nIn 2018, during the annual DSA convention, the Malaysian Army showcased a joint exercise between the NCO systems via Army Operations Room and Soldiers equipped with FSS systems, where the Army Operations Room coordinated the Soldiers doing numerous activities, first being a live firing of a 3-man squad involving the usage of artillery and how precise the accuracy of the artilleries via the NCO and FSS equipment, second being in an Army Training centre, and last being a real simulation operation in East Malaysia. Currently, several combat elements such as the 12th Royal Malay Regiment and the 4th Mechanised Brigate are outfitted with the system. Through the use of this system, the Malaysian Army is able to operate anywhere throughout the world, especially during United Nations Operations.\n\n\n\n"}

He is one of two snowboarders, along with Steve Fisher, ever to beat Shaun White in the X Games Superpipe.\n\nAutti is the first non-American to win the event. He kicked off his final run with back-to-back 1080s, one of the hardest snowboarding tricks, and is only the third snowboarder to land the sequence in competition, behind Michael McBee and Ross Powers.\n\nHis clutch and technical performance sparked the \"1080 Revolution\" and set a new standard in men's halfpipe competition, where men must throw at least one 1080, if not two back-to-back, in order to do well in contests. Just two weeks earlier, he was crowned double World Champion in Big Air and the halfpipe at the 2005 Snowboarding World Championships in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nBorn to Yrjö and Katariina Autti, Autti hails from Rovaniemi, a 55,000 population city that sits on the Arctic Circle and is considered the gateway to the Lapland region of Finland. Athletic genes run in his family - Autti's younger brother Tuomas is an aspiring freestyle skier, and his uncle is Arto Autti, who was a defender on the Finnish National football team. Autti started snowboarding in spring 1995 after he saw someone snowboarding while on a skiing vacation with his family at the Ylläs ski center in Lapland.\n\nFollowing his breakthrough at the World Championships and the Winter X Games, Autti went on to finish second at the 2005 Nippon Open, third at the 2005 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships and first in Big Air at the Arctic Challenge, the exclusive snowboarding event founded by Terje Haakonsen. He was also awarded Best Tweak for his switch backside 540, which is his favorite trick.\n\nIn April 2005, it was officially announced that Autti would represent Finland at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\nOver the summer of 2005 at the end of July, he competed in Nokia's Totally Board in Taiwan. Autti embarked on Billabong's Freeway Tour in August, which spirits Billabong-sponsored riders to various contests in Australia and New Zealand. He won the Perisher Pipe Cup and took third in the Slopestyle Jam. It was Autti's first time Down Under, and he likes New Zealand's famed Snowpark because it is like a \"big playground,\" and it reminds him of Finland because \"you can see everyone from the lift.\" Australian snowboarders on the Tour, Nick Gregory and Clint Allan, introduced Autti to their country's native wombats and kangaroos and got him addicted to pies.\n\nAutti kicked off the 2005-2006 World Cup season with third and first-place finishes in Valle Nevado, Chile in September. He followed it in October with a second place podium in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.\n\nDuring Finland's Annual Skiexpo in November 2005, Autti was awarded Rider of the Year by Slammer Magazine's Riders of the Year Awards. He received the most votes in a readers internet poll. He also finished ninth in Finland's annual Sports Athlete of the Year poll, voted on by sports magazine journalists.\n\nBefore the end of 2005, Autti competed in the X-Trail Jam in Japan and finished fifth in the quarterpipe and fourth in the straight jump. For his banner year, he was invited to Finland's President's Ball in December, an annual banquet honoring all of the elite athletes, politicians, celebrities, and public figures in Finland. Autti attended the event with Mattila, where they met the President, Tarja Halonen — who was re-elected for a second term on January 29, 2006 — and her husband Pentti Arajävi.\n\nAutti competed in the Burton European Open in Laax, Switzerland in January 2006, taking second place in slopestyle. Two days later, riding with a bruised rib, he finished fourth in the halfpipe.\n\nAt the 2006 Winter X Games, the extremely icy pipe proved to be hazardous to numerous riders, including Autti, and he came up short in his defense of his gold medal, finishing sixth.\n\nTwo weeks later at the 2006 Winter Olympics, despite a near-flawless run, he finished fifth with a controversial low score of 39.1 that elicited plenty of \"boos\" from fans in the stands. Bronze medalist and teammate Markku Koski felt the same way, stating it should have been Autti on the podium.\n\nAfter a two-week stay in Japan, Autti returned to the top of the podium at the Vans Cup at Tahoe in March and pocketed $20,000. He finished the season with a sixth-place finish in the quarterpipe and 10th-place finishes in the halfpipe and slopestyle at the 2006 U.S. Open.\n\nIn April 2006, Autti and his Flow teammates swept the TransWorld Team Challenge, taking five awards, including Best Halfpipe Rider for Autti.\n\nIn December 2006, he scored 3rd place at the Nokia Air & Style in Munich, Germany. The Air & Style is considered one of the biggest and most prestigious events in Europe.\n\nAutti has not competed recently and has been more focused on making video of backcountry riding.\n\nAutti participated in the Winter X Games 12. He finished 3rd in Best Trick Showdown, 7th in Snowboard Superpipe, and 4th in Snowboard Slopestyle. Most recently he won the 2008 Toyota Big Air Japan beating his fellow Flow teammate Risto Mattila, who came in second place.\n\n2009- Autti placed 3rd, in the men's superpipe competition in X Games 13\n\nAutti, who speaks Finnish, English and Swedish, enjoys skateboarding, photography, salmiakki, movies (especially Johnny Depp films) and music. Some of his favorite artists include Turbonegro, The Hellacopters, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, David Bowie, Social Distortion, The Datsuns and Mötley Crüe. He listened to Mötley Crüe's \"Kickstart My Heart\" — which he dubs \"probably the best song ever\" — during his gold medal-winning run at the 2005 X Games. Autti's favorite drink is scotch without rocks, and he says he would be a bartender if he were not a snowboarder. He says he cannot define himself as an athlete in the traditional sense because \"in my opinion I'm a snowboarder and my own person.\" The best part of being a professional snowboarder, he feels, is traveling around the world, meeting new people and experiencing new cultures.\n\nAlways calm, cool and collected, Autti tries not to stress himself out too much if he is not riding well because he believes it is important to not lose the fun of snowboarding, echoing his advice to future shredders: \"It'd be best if people that throw themselves into snowboarding understood what this sport is about. The competitions alone don't mean everything. There'll always be more of them. In my opinion, the fun going-ons and the smile on your face are a lot more important. Doing well's nice, no doubt about it, but it's important that you don't lose the pleasure of the riding itself in the competing.\"\n\nAutti is sponsored by Billabong, Transform Gloves, Nokia, Shred Optics, Northwave, Drake\n\n"}

He is credited with setting up a nearly independent Chupanid state in northern Persia during the struggles taking place in the aftermath of the Ilkhanate.\n\nHasan's father, Timurtash, was executed by the Mamelukes in 1328. The son's rise to power began three years after the death of the last powerful Ilkhan, Abu Sa'id. The Jalayirids under Hasan Buzurg had recently mastered western Persia, putting a puppet Muhammad Khan on the Ilkhanid throne in 1336. Hasan attempted to unify the fragmented Chobanid family. Claiming his father was alive, he used a slave named Qara Jari (a possible offspring of Hasan's grandfather Chupan) to impersonate him. The widow of Timurtash was even married to him. Mameluk Sultan Al-Nasr Muhammad, who had ordered Timurtash' execution, attempted to expose the fraud, but without much success. The Chobanids rallied to him; several of them (such as Pir Hosayn) defected from Hasan Buzurg's service. Together, they defeated Hasan Buzurg in Alataq on July 16, 1338. Muhammed Khan was executed, and the region around Tabriz was occupied.\n\nAt this point, Qara Jari attempted to get rid of Hasan Kucek and take power for himself, but fled when the effort failed. Following this, Hasan raised Sati Beg, sister of Abu Sa'id and widow of Coban, to the Ilkhanid throne in the summer of 1338. When Togha Temur, another claimant to the throne, invaded from Khurasan in the winter of 1339 at the behest of Hasan Buzurg, the Chobanid offered Sati's hand to him in marriage. Using this to receive letters of assurance from Togha Temur, Hasan Kucek forwarded these to the Jalayirids. Hasan Buzurg, feeling betrayed, stopped his advance in support of Togha, and the latter was forced to retreat in July 1339. \n\nIn the meantime, Hasan Kuchak found a new suitable puppet in the form of Suleiman Khan, whom he forced Sati Beg to marry in May 1339. Hasan decided to march against the Jalayirids again. Supported by Pir Hosayn, as well as his uncle Surgan, he defeated the Jalayirids on June 26, 1340, in the Zarrinarüd valley near Maraga. Surgan was made governor of Iraq. \n\nDuring Hasan Kuchak’s reign, not all of the Chobanids remained loyal. Surgan, unhappy with the treatment of Sati Beg (who was his mother), defected to Hasan Buzurg. An alliance was formed between the two, soon joined by the ruler of Diyarbakr, as well as Sultan Al-Nasr. Hasan Kuchak, however, managed to lure him out of the alliance, and the Mameluks soon abandoned their support. Still, Surgan began to plot with Togha Temur, who sent his brother Amir Shaikh 'Ali Kavon to invade Iraq. These forces were defeated by Hasan Kuchak's brother Malek Asraf in the latter half of 1341, and Surgan was soon imprisoned.\n\nAround the same time, several of the Chobanids became embroiled in a conflict concerning Fars. Malek Asraf, along with his cousin Pir Hosayn and his uncle Yagi Basti, were involved in a conflict that also included the Injuids, the owners of the area, and the Jalayirids.

{"id": "1966360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966360", "title": "Epoxies", "text": "Epoxies\n\nThe Epoxies were an American new wave band from Portland, Oregon, formed in 2000. Heavily influenced by new wave, the band jokingly described themselves as robot garage rock. Members included FM Static on synthesizers, guitarist Viz Spectrum, lead singer Roxy Epoxy, bass guitarist Shock Diode, and drummer Ray Cathode. They grew in popularity due in large part to extensive touring in both the United States and Europe where they showcased frantically paced, highly energetic on-stage productions. They were known for using special effects for their live act and sporting home-made costumes, sometimes made mostly of duct tape.\n\nThe group's music is a novel synthesis of punk rock and new wave but their lyrics are strictly focused on science fiction themes, Atomic Age futurism, alienation and consumerism. Robots, androids, clones and nuclear weapons all figure prominently in the Epoxies' lyrics.\n\nMembers of the Epoxies had been involved with punk bands in the Portland area since the mid-1990s. Most notably, FM played with and Roxy photographed many album covers for The Automatics. FM and Viz conceived of a band wearing spray-painted refrigerator boxes and dryer hose as home-made robot costumes. This soon gave way to less restrictive (but generally just as low budget) costumes as the impracticality of wearing a box and playing a guitar became apparent. Kid Polymer soon took up the bass guitar when FM and Viz finally decided to go ahead with the idea. Dr. Grip and Roxy were the last to join the band in 2000, completing their first line-up. Surprisingly, this was the first time Roxy had considered being in a band. They were first known as the Adhesives before discovering that another group with that name existed nearby.\n\nIn September 2001, the Epoxies released their first recording on Dirtnap Records, based in Seattle at the time. The self-titled 7\" vinyl contained the tracks \"Need More Time\", \"Molded Plastic\" and a cover version of \"Beat My Guest\" by Adam and the Ants. This was the start of a longstanding association with the Pacific Northwest label and several other bands on it at the time such as The Briefs and The Spits.\n\nThe first recording formed the basis for a full-length album that followed in March 2002 with extensive West Coast tours to support it. Between the release of their first album and August that year Kid Polymer left the band and was replaced on bass guitar by Shock Diode, who has the fictional persona of a clone.\n\nThe band released a 7\" single, \"Synthesised\", in October 2003, with a B-side cover version of Alice Cooper's \"Clones (We're All)\". Before their first US tour at the end of the year, the Epoxies also began making a CD EP to sell at shows that collected their previous 7\" releases. Soon after the tour Dr. Grip decided to leave the band and was replaced by Ray Cathode, who claims to be a clone much like Shock Diode.\n\nThe Epoxies continued to tour the United States in 2003 and 2004 often opening for the Groovie Ghoulies. The group also toured Europe for the first time in 2004 with NOFX. \"Need More Time\" was released again the following year on Fat Wreck Chords' \"Rock Against Bush\" compilation.\n\nThis inclusion led the Epoxies to sign with Fat Wreck Chords for their second album, \"Stop the Future\", released in April 2005, which included a cover version of the Scorpions' \"Robot Man\". It showcased more of the short, fast songs that fans had come to expect while also showing a more down-tempo and melodic style with the ending track \"Toys\" (their first song to last longer than 4:30).\n\nThey spent most of 2005 and 2006 touring with similarly pseudonymed bands The Aquabats and The Phenomenauts; Fat Wreck Chords label-mates Smoke or Fire, The Soviettes and Against Me!, and fellow pop-punkers Teenage Bottlerocket.\n\nDuring this tour, the band re-recorded the single \"Synthesised\" in the fictional Simlish language for the release of \"\" computer game in 2006.\n\nThe Epoxies signed with Metropolis Records in June 2007 and released an EP in August entitled \"My New World\".\nPosts to the Metropolis website indicate that they planned an album to follow later in the year.\nHowever, in a MySpace blog interview on March 17, 2008, Roxy confirmed rumors that the Epoxies were probably broken up, or at least on an extended hiatus.\n\nLead vocalist Roxy Epoxy began hosting a radio show broadcast on Portland State University's campus radio station in April 2007, and fronted the new wave/pop rock band Roxy Epoxy and the Rebound. They released their first CD, \"Band Aids on Bullet Holes\", in March 2009 on Metropolis Records, and underwent a national tour supporting TheStart the same month. As a solo artist, Roxy Epoxy released in 2010 a 5-tracks EP called \"1000\" with the avant-garde French record label Rotorelief. In 2016, Roxy moved back to her home state of Massachusetts to attend the 2-year MBA program at F.W. Olin School of Business at Babson College. She is currently working on new music with Chris Pierce from Groucho Marxists and Doc Hopper at his studio, Volume IV, located in New Brunswick, NJ.\n\nFM Static went on to briefly tour as a guitarist (under the name \"Fritz M. Static\") for the Oakland-based \"Rocket Roll\" band The Phenomenauts. He continued to be their touring keyboardist, playing on several national and international tours, through 2014. Since 2010, he also plays bass in the new wave punk band The Bloodtypes, who have toured both nationally and internationally and released an album and an EP. FM Static has also started his own synth punk one man show entitled Static and the Cubes.\n\nRyan (Shock Diode) appeared on Cecilia and the Sauerkrauts' full-length album \"Sauerkraut, Wurst Und Other Delights\". He then founded the synth punk band Sex Crime together with his wife Cecilia (No-Talents / Operation S) as well as former Epoxies drummer Tim (Ray Cathode). Sex Crime has released three 7\" (on Danger Records, No Front Teeth Records and Jonny Cat Records) and one full-length album on Danger Records.\nMeanwhile, Tim (Ray Cathode) has also helped to form a new band in Portland called The Bourbonettes who appeared on \"Shower Time! A Tribute to The Punk Group\". The band then renamed itself to Suicide Notes and still performs under that moniker. They have released two singles and one full length on Dead Beat Records to date.\n\nOn May 29, 2010, the Epoxies reunited for a one-off performance at a local benefit show in Portland. Perhaps confirming the group's permanent dissolution, FM Static announced to the audience before the show began to \"go nuts now cause [a reunion] ain't gonna fucking happen again!\".\n\nApril 14, 2015, Roxy Epoxy posted on her Twitter about a show, fuelling speculation that the Epoxies had reformed. This was then confirmed via a Tweet on April 16, 2015 stating that The Epoxies would be playing a show with the Spits at Dante's in Portland for the Project Pabst Music Festival on July 18, 2015. The show sold out well before the performance and saw the Epoxies return to the stage with their old swagger and allure.\n\nThe Epoxies started as a reaction to popular rock music at the time. The original members felt that the entertainment and stage performance aspects of popular music were being ignored and it is this sentiment that results in their characteristic energetic shows and flamboyant homemade costumes.\n\nAs part of rebelling against established musical conventions, the band chose to include a synthesizer; they \"had the intent of offending people with it because it's such an uncool instrument.\" However, with the rise of synthesizers in popular music since, the Epoxies are often compared to acts such as The Bravery and The Killers, leading the band to wonder if they are not accomplishing their objectives by being \"overly cool\" instead. One of the synthsizers FM often used was a monophonic Roland SH-101 keytar.\n\nViz used a futuristic looking Epiphone Explorer that had been repainted and modified to contain a laser and a bank of LEDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Epoxies\nRoxy Epoxy\n"}

SuperCalc was created to fill that void and market opportunity. Alongside WordStar, it was one of the CP/M applications bundled with the Osborne 1 portable computer. It quickly became popular and was ported to MS-DOS in 1982.\n\nAn improvement over VisiCalc (though using much the same command structure using the slash key), SuperCalc was one of the first spreadsheet programs capable of iteratively solving circular references (cells that depend on each other's results). It would be over 10 years after the introduction of SuperCalc before this feature was implemented in Microsoft Excel, although in Lotus 1-2-3, manual programming of iterative logic could also be used to solve this issue. According to the SuperCalc product manager, iterative calculations were added when Sorcim changed from binary-coded decimal to binary math. Since the precision of the two math packages was different, some IF statements resolved differently, and iterative calculations helped solve this problem.\n\nVersions of SuperCalc were later released for the Apple II, for PCs running MS-DOS, and, after Sorcim was bought by CA Technologies (CA) in 1985, for Microsoft Windows (under the name CA-SuperCalc). SuperCalc was CA Technologies' first personal computer product. The MS-DOS versions were more popular with many users than the market-leading Lotus 1-2-3, because it was distributed without copy protection, as well as being priced lower.\n\nBy the release of version 3 in March 1987, a million users were claimed. New versions were published into the early 1990s, after which Microsoft Excel dominated the spreadsheet market.\n\nIn 1993, the Ministry of Railway of Russia signed an agreement with CA Technologies after a Russian employee illegally used SuperCalc for government purposes.\n\n\n"}

He was the only representative of the armed forces to be present at the signing of the German instruments of surrender in Luneburg Heath on 4 May 1945, in Reims on 7 May and in Berlin on 8 May 1945. \"Generaladmiral\" von Friedeburg committed suicide shortly afterwards, upon the dissolution of the Flensburg Government.\n\nHans-Georg von Friedeburg was born in Strassburg in the German Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine, the son of Prussian officer Karl von Friedeburg (1862–1924). \n\nOn 1 April 1914 he joined the Imperial Navy as a \"Seekadett\". After the outbreak of World War I, von Friedeburg, promoted to the rank of \"Fähnrich zur See\" (Officer Aspirant) served on the dreadnought and took part in the 1916 Battle of Jutland against the British Royal Navy's Grand Fleet. Elevated to \"Leutnant zur See\", he joined the U-boat forces as naval officer on from June to November 1918.\n\nA prominent German naval officer of the post-war period, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the German U-boat fleet in September 1941. Overseeing German U-boat training and deployment of the U-boat bases in France, he later organised U-boat picket lines in the mid-Atlantic to find and attack Allied convoys. Promoted to Rear Admiral in 1942, von Friedeburg assumed command of the German U-boat fleet in February of the following year. He was awarded the \"Ritterkreuz des Kriegsverdienstkreuzes mit Schwertern\" on 17 January 1945. He succeeded Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine when Dönitz became Reich President upon Hitler's suicide (and per Hitler's last will), and was promoted to general admiral on 1 May 1945.\n\nIn early May 1945, von Friedeburg was ordered by Dönitz to negotiate the surrender to the Western Allied forces. Arriving at Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's headquarters in Lüneburg, Germany he was informed that an unconditional surrender to all Allied forces was necessary and not negotiable. Upon receiving permission from Dönitz, he signed an instrument of surrender of all German armed forces in the Netherlands, northwest Germany and Denmark on 4 May 1945. On 7 May 1945, he was present at the first signing of the German Instrument of Surrender by General Alfred Jodl in Reims. \n\nVon Friedeburg was in Berlin on 8 May 1945 for the second signing of the German Instrument of Surrender. He signed on behalf of the Kriegsmarine, along with Colonel General Hans-Jürgen Stumpff for the Luftwaffe and Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel for the Heer and OKW. Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Air Chief Marshal Arthur William Tedder signed for the Soviet Union and SHAEF respectively.\n\nOn 23 May 1945, the same day that members of the Flensburg Government were arrested, von Friedeburg became a prisoner of war of the British Army in Plön, and committed suicide by swallowing poison. His body was buried at Adelby Cemetery near Flensburg.\n\nHis son Ludwig von Friedeburg (1924–2010) became a sociologist and later a politician, serving from 1969 and 1974 as Minister for Culture in the state of Hesse.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a son of Jin Youzhi and a nephew of Puyi, the last emperor of China. \n\nJin was born in Beiping (Beijing) on May 3, 1942. His father Aisin-Gioro Puren was the youngest brother of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, who at the time reigned as \"emperor\" of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo and who had previously been the last emperor of the Qing dynasty.\n\nJin was educated at China University of Geosciences.

{"id": "1966411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966411", "title": "Allen Telescope Array", "text": "Allen Telescope Array\n\nThe Allen Telescope Array (ATA), formerly known as the One Hectare Telescope (1hT), is a radio telescope array dedicated to astronomical observations and a simultaneous search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The array is situated at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Shasta County, northeast of San Francisco, California.\n\nThe project was originally developed as a joint effort between the SETI Institute and the Radio Astronomy Laboratory (RAL) at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), with funds obtained from an initial 11.5 million donation by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. The first phase of construction was completed and the ATA finally became operational on 11 October 2007 with 42 antennas (ATA-42), after Paul Allen (co-founder of Microsoft) had pledged an additional $13.5 million to support the construction of the first and second phases.\n\nAlthough overall Allen has contributed more than $30 million to the project, it has not succeeded in building the 350 6.1 m (20 ft) dishes originally conceived, and the project suffered an operational hiatus due to funding shortfalls between April and August 2011, after which observations resumed. Subsequently, UC Berkeley exited the project, completing divestment in April 2012. The facility is now managed by SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute), an independent, nonprofit research institute. As of 2016, the SETI Institute performs observations with the ATA between the hours of 6 pm and 6 am daily.\n\nIn August 2014, the installation was threatened by a forest fire in the area and was briefly forced to shut down, but ultimately emerged largely unscathed.\n\nFirst conceived by SETI pioneer Frank Drake, the idea has been a dream of the SETI Institute for years. However, it was not until early 2001 that research and development began, after a donation of $11.5 million by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. In March 2004, following the successful completion of a three-year research and development phase, the SETI Institute unveiled a three-tier construction plan for the telescope. Construction began immediately, thanks to the pledge of $13.5 million by Paul Allen (co-founder of Microsoft) to support the construction of the first and second phases. The SETI Institute named the telescope in Allen's honor. Overall, Paul Allen contributed more than $30 million to the project.\n\nThe ATA is a centimeter-wave array which pioneers the Large-Number Small-Diameter concept of building radio telescopes. Compared to a large dish antenna, large numbers of smaller dishes are cheaper for the same collecting area. To get similar sensitivity, the signals from all telescopes must be combined. This requires high-performance electronics, which had been prohibitively expensive. Due to the declining cost of electronic components, the required electronics became practicable, resulting in a large cost-saving over telescopes of more conventional design. This is informally referred to as \"replacing steel with silicon\".\n\nThe ATA has four primary technical capabilities that make it well suited for a range of scientific investigations: a very wide field of view (2.45° at λ = 21 cm), complete instantaneous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11.2 gigahertz (GHz), multiple simultaneous backends, and active interference mitigation. The area of sky which can be instantaneously imaged is 17 times that obtainable by the Very Large Array telescope. The instantaneous frequency coverage of more than four octaves is unprecedented in radio astronomy, and is the result of a unique feed, input amplifier and signal path design. Active interference mitigation will make it possible to observe even at the frequencies of many terrestrial radio emitters.\nAll-sky surveys are an important part of the science program, and the ATA will have increased efficiency through its ability to conduct extraterrestrial intelligence searches (SETI) and other radio astronomy observations simultaneously. The telescope can do this by splitting the recorded signals in the control room prior to final processing. Simultaneous observations are possible because for SETI, wherever the telescope is pointed, several target stars will lie within the large field of view afforded by the 6 m dishes. By agreement between the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory (RAL) and the SETI Institute, the needs of conventional radio astronomy determined the pointing of the array up until 2012.\n\nThe ATA is planned to comprise 350 6 m dishes and will make possible large, deep radio surveys that were not previously feasible. The telescope design incorporates many new features, including hydroformed antenna surfaces, a log-periodic feed covering the entire range of frequencies from 500 megahertz (MHz) to 11.2 GHz, and low-noise, wide-band amplifiers with a flat response over the entire band, thus making it possible to amplify the sky signal directly. This amplified signal, containing the entire received bandwidth, is brought from each antenna to the processing room via optical fiber cables. This means that as electronics improve and wider bandwidths are obtainable, only the central processor needs to change, and not the antennas or feeds.\n\nThe instrument was operated and maintained by RAL until development of the array was put on hold in 2011. RAL worked hand in hand with the SETI Institute during design and prototyping and was the primary designer of the feed, antenna surfaces, beamforming, correlator, and imaging system for radio astronomy observations.\n\nThe panel for the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey in its report, \"Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium\", endorsed SETI and recognized the ATA (then called the 1-Hectare Telescope) as an important stepping stone towards the building of the Square Kilometer Array telescope (SKA). The most recent Decadal report recommended ending the US's financial support of the SKA, although US participation in SKA precursors such as MeerKAT, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Murchison Widefield Array.\n\nAlthough cost estimates of unbuilt projects are always dubious, and the specifications are not identical (conventional telescopes have lower noise temperature, but the ATA has a larger field of view, for example), the ATA has potential promise as a much cheaper radio telescope technology for a given effective aperture. For example, the amount spent on the first ATA-42 phase, including technology development, is roughly one third of the cost of a new copy of a Deep Space Network 34 m antenna of similar collecting area. Similarly, the estimated total cost of building the remaining 308 dishes was estimated () at about $41 million. This is about two times cheaper than the $85 million cost of the last large radio astronomy antenna built in the US, the Green Bank Telescope, of similar collecting area. The contractor filed for a $29 million overrun, but only $4 million of this was allowed.\n\nThe ATA aspires to be among the world's largest and fastest observing instruments, and to permit astronomers to search many different target stars simultaneously. If completed as originally envisioned, it will be one of the largest and most powerful telescopes in the world.\n\nSince its inception, the ATA has been a development tool for astronomical interferometer technology (specifically, for the Square Kilometer Array).\nThe ATA was originally planned to be constructed in four stages, ATA-42, ATA-98, ATA-206 and ATA-350, each number representing the number of dishes in the array at a given time. (See Table 1). The ATA is planned to comprise 350 dishes with a diameter of 6 m each.\n\nRegular operations with 42 dishes started on 11 October 2007. Funding for building additional antennas is currently being sought by the SETI Institute from various sources, including the United States Navy, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Science Foundation (NSF) and private donors.\n\nSimultaneous astronomical and SETI observations are performed with two 32-input dual polarization imaging correlators. Numerous articles reporting conventional radio astronomy observations have been published.\n\nThree phased array beamformers utilizing the Berkeley Emulation Engine 2 (BEE2) were deployed in June 2007 and have been integrated into the system to allow for simultaneous astronomical and SETI observations. As of April 2008, the first pulsar observations were conducted using the beamformer and a purpose-built pulsar spectrometer.\n\nThe workhorse SETI search system (SETI on ATA or SonATA) performs fully automated SETI observations. SonATA follows up on detected signals in real time and continues to track them until 1) the signal is shown to have been generated on Earth or rarely, 2) the source sets, which triggers follow up the next day. As of 2016, more that two hundred million signals have been followed up and classified using the ATA. Not one of these signals had all the characteristics expected for an ETI signal. The results of SETI Institute's observations are published in a number of papers.\n\nIn April 2011, the ATA was put into hibernation owing to funding shortfalls, meaning that it was no longer available for use. Operation of the ATA resumed on 5 December 2011. Efforts are now led by Andrew Siemion.\nIn 2012, the ATA was funded by a $3.6 million philanthropic donation by Franklin Antonio, cofounder and Chief Scientist of Qualcomm Incorporated. This gift supports upgrades of all the receivers on the ATA dishes to have dramatically greater sensitivity (2 − 10× from 1–8 GHz) than before and support sensitive observations over a wider frequency range, from 1–15 GHz, when initially the radio frequency electronics went to only 11 GHz. By July 2016, the first ten of these receivers had been installed and proven. Full installation on all 42 antennas is planned .\n\nIn November 2015, the ATA studied the anomalous star KIC 8462852, and in autumn 2017 the Allen Telescope Array examined the interstellar asteroid 'Oumuamua for signs of technology, but detected no unusual radio emissions.\n\nThe science goals listed below represent the most important projects to be conducted with the ATA. Each of these goals is associated with one of the four stages of development mentioned earlier. (See Table 1). Also listed is some of the science that it is hoped each will produce.\n\n\nSince construction of the array began, a few science goals not specifically drawn up for it have been suggested.\n\nFor example, the Allen Telescope Array has offered to provide the mooncast data downlink for any contestants in the Google Lunar X Prize. This is practical, since the array, with no modifications, covers the main space communications bands (S-band and X-band). A telemetry decoder would be the only needed addition.\n\nAlso, the ATA was mentioned as a candidate for searching for a new type of radio transient. It is an excellent choice for this owing to its large field of view and wide instantaneous bandwidth. Following this suggestion, Andrew Siemion and an international team of astronomers and engineers developed an instrument called \"Fly's Eye\" that allowed the ATA to search for bright radio transients, and observations were carried out between February and April 2008.\n\nThe ATA-42 configuration will provide a maximum baseline of 300 m (and ultimately for the ATA-350, 900 m). A cooled log-periodic feed on each antenna is designed to provide a system temperature of ~45K from 1–10 GHz, with reduced sensitivity in the ranges of 0.5–1.0 GHz and 10–11.2 GHz. Four separate frequency tunings (IFs) are available to produce 4 x 100 MHz intermediate frequency bands. Two IFs support correlators for imaging; two will support SETI observing. All tunings can produce four dual polarization phased array beams which can be independently pointed within the primary beam and can be used with a variety of detectors. The ATA can therefore synthesize up to 32 phased array beams.\n\nThe wide field of view of the ATA gives it an unparalleled capability for large surveys (Fig. 4). The time required for mapping a large area to a given sensitivity is proportional to (\"ND\"), where \"N\" is the number of elements and \"D\" is the diameter of the dish. This leads to the surprising result that a large array of small dishes can outperform an array with a smaller number of elements but considerably greater collecting area in the task of large surveys. As a consequence, even the ATA-42 is competitive with much larger telescopes in its capability for both brightness temperature and point source surveys. For point source surveys, the ATA-42 is comparable in speed to Arecibo and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), but three times slower than the Very Large Array (VLA). The ATA-350, on the other hand, will be one order of magnitude faster than the Very Large Array for point source surveys, and is comparable to the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) in survey speed. For surveys up to a specified brightness temperature sensitivity, the ATA-98 will exceed the survey speed of even the VLA-D configuration. The ATA-206 should match the brightness temperature sensitivity of Arecibo and the GBT. The ATA, however, provides better resolution than either of these single-dish telescopes.\n\nThe antennas for the ATA are 6.1 x 7.0 meters (20.0 ft x 23.0 ft) hydroformed offset Gregorian telescopes, each with a 2.4 meter sub-reflector with an effective focal length/diameter (f/D) ratio of 0.65. (See DeBoer, 2001). The offset geometry eliminates blockage, which increases efficiency and decreases the side lobes. It also allows for the large sub-reflector, providing good low frequency performance. The hydroforming technology used to make these surfaces is the same as that used by Andersen Manufacturing of Idaho Falls, Idaho to generate low-cost satellite reflectors. The unique interior frame rim-supported compact mount allows excellent performance at low cost. The drive system employs a spring-loaded passive anti-backlash azimuth drive train. Most components designed by Matthew Fleming and manufactured at Minex Engineering Corp. in Antioch, CA.\n\nAs with other arrays, the huge amount of incoming sensory information requires real-time array processing capability in order to reduce data volume for storage. For ATA-256, the average data rates and total data volume for the correlator are estimated to be 100 Mbyte/s and 15 Pbytes for the five-year survey period. Experiments such as transient surveys will exceed this rate significantly. The beamformers produce data at a much higher rate (8 gigabytes per second (Gb/s)) but only a very small fraction of this data is archived. In 2009, the signal detection hardware and software was called Prelude, which was\ncomposed of rack-mounted PCs augmented by two custom accelerator cards based on digital signal processing (DSP) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. Each Programmable Detection Module (one of 28 PCs) can analyze 2 MHz of dual-polarization input data to generate spectra with spectral resolution of 0.7 Hz and time samples of 1.4 seconds.\n\nIn 2009, the array had a 40 Mbit/s internet connection, adequate for remote access and transferring of data products for ATA-256. An upgrade to 40 Gbit/s was planned, which would enable direct distribution of raw data for offsite computing.\n\nLike other array systems the ATA has a computational complexity and cross-connect which scales as O(N) with the number of antennas formula_1.\nThe computation requirement, for example, for correlating the full ATA bandwidth (formula_2 = 11 GHz) for the proposed formula_1 = 350 dual-polarization antenna build-out, using an efficient frequency-multiply (FX) architecture and a modest 500 kHz channel width (with number of channels formula_4 = 2200), is given by:\n\nformula_5 = 44 Peta-OPs per second\n\nwhere formula_6 is an operation. Note that since each dish has a dual polarization antenna, each signal sample is actually a two data set, hence formula_7.\n\n\n"}

The series composed of two parts, with a gap in between the airing.\n\nThe entire series took place in a continuing flashback, with the protagonist, Tim Yip (Gallen Lo), pondering the trials and tribulations he went through while riding on a train in the \"green city\" he developed.\n\nThe drama documents the rise and fall of three entrepreneurs, who founded Lik Tin Century Corporation (力天世紀) together to achieve the ultimate goal of developing a pollution-free town in Hong Kong. Vendetta and love serves as strong subplots throughout the series, with the vendetta between two families being the most prominent.\n\nThe stories covered a span of 20 years, from 1990 to 2010, and featured many technologies that came to age during this time, including the nascent internet, and a bulkier tamaguchi virtual pet device (shown as a device similar to Game Boy in the series), which was developed by one of the entrepreneurs before his entry into construction.\n\nIt was speculated that the show was not originally meant to become a cross-millennium event, and was rushed into development and broadcast by TVB because of a slump in ratings.\n\nIn Hong Kong, TVB is the predominant TV station in terms of ratings, often receiving 90% viewing shares. During the summer of 1999, the Mainland-Taiwanese drama \"My Fair Princess\", aired by rival broadcaster ATV, took away a significant portion of TVB's audience, and came out on top in the ratings battle during certain hours.\n\nIt is speculated, but never confirmed, that the managements of TVB drafted its top actors and actresses to perform in the series, and rushed the production into broadcast as a weapon against the resurgent ATV. Supporters of this theory point to the splitting of the series into two parts, with a gap in between the broadcast to allow for production time. Opponents of the speculation assert that ATV only had a one-off hit with \"My Fair Princess\", and there were no other series afterward that could have retained the audience that eventually returned to TVB. The opponents also allude to the fact that even during the lowest point of the entire crisis, TVB still retained a competitive edge in ratings, and would have been able to defeat ATV right after \"My Fair Princess\" concluded. However, this still does not provide an explanation to the gap between two series.\n\nThe series was the costliest ever produced in Hong Kong television history, totaling more than HK$100 million (US$12.8 Million), thus creating a record that no other television series has ever been able to break until \"The Gem of Life\" in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameo appearances by Kenneth Ma as Stanley, Lik Tin's stock broker and Raymond Lam as a Taiwanese prison guard.\n\n\n"}

The settlement lies at the head of Loch Buie, a sea loch which contains the tidal islands of Eilean Mòr and Eilean Uamh Ghuaidhre. Frank Lockwood's Island (or Eilean Sneth Dian) lies in the Firth of Lorne, just offshore from the Laggan peninsula to the south. This island is named after Frank Lockwood who was Solicitor General for England and Wales from 1894 to 1895 and the brother-in-law of the 21st MacLean of Lochbuie.\n\nThe highest hills in the area are Ben Buie whose summit is above sea level to the north, the Druim Fada range reaching to the south and Craig Ben, at to the east, overlooking Loch Spelve. A track allows walking access to Carsaig to the west.\n\nThere is a fine stone circle at Lochbuie, the only one on Mull, and the remains of a pre-historic tomb. Both these sites are scheduled monuments, as is Moy Castle, originally a 14th-century keep, subsequently altered, and is now an uninhabited 3-storey tower. It is near the imposing 18th-century Lochbuie House and both buildings were once the seat of Clan Maclaine of Lochbuie. There is the medieval chapel of Caibeal Mheamhair, which may originally have been dedicated to St. Oran, rebuilt in the 19th century as a mausoleum for the MacLaine family. A luxurious silver brooch (known as the \"Lochbuie Brooch\") dating to c. 1500 was found on the estate and has been in the British Museum's collection since 1855. Lochbuie is in the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles and there is a small Episcopal church built in 1876 consecrated to the mythical St Kilda.\n\nBetween 1752 and the construction of the existing mansion house the MacLaine lived in a smaller house on the estate. There is an inscription above a doorway in Lochbuie House farm square that states: \"After leaving Moy Castle the Lochbuie family resided in this house from 1752 to 1789 and it was in this house that Dr. Johnson and Mr. Boswell were entertained in 1773 by John MacLaine XVII chief of Lochbuie.\"\n\nSamuel Johnson wrote:\n\nWe came without any difficulty, at evening, to Lochbuy, where we found a\ntrue Highland Laird, rough and haughty, and tenacious of his dignity;\nwho, hearing my name, inquired whether I was of the Johnstons of\nGlencroe, or of Ardnamurchan.\n\nLochbuy has, like the other insular Chieftains, quitted the castle that sheltered his ancestors, and lives near it, in a mansion not very spacious or splendid. I have seen no houses in the Islands much to be envied for convenience or magnificence, yet they bare testimony to the progress of arts and civility, as they shew that rapine and surprise are no longer dreaded, and are much more commodious than the ancient fortresses.\n\nPerhaps the area's most noted modern residents have been George Sassoon (author, linguist and son of the poet Siegfried Sassoon) and Siegfried's wife, the former Hester Gatty.\n\nThe Lochbuie Estate run by the Corbett family since 1921, is a sporting estate and a cattle farm. Self-catering cottages are available and both loch and sea-fishing.\n\nScenes for the 1945 film \"I Know Where I'm Going!\" directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were shot at Lochbuie, and a group of 40 fans visited to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the film's release in 2005.\n\n"}

This feeling was not particularly strong, however, as evidenced by the fact that Julius Vogel, a practising Jew, was able to become Premier in 1873. Vogel did, however, suffer jibes about his faith, and political cartoonists frequently employed various Jewish stereotypes against him. The fact that he served as treasurer was particularly played upon, with stereotypes of Jewish bankers and moneylenders being brought out. However, none of this anti-Semitism was conducted in an organised fashion, being simply the views of individuals rather than any sort of political movement.\n\nNew Zealander Arthur Desmond, \"possibly the most widely read and influential political writer New Zealand has ever produced\", incorporated anti-semitism into his writing, particularly his 1896 political treatise \"Might Is Right\". Numerous editions of the book have been printed and it found new popularity with neo-Nazi groups in the 21st century.\n\nIn the early 20th century, another more disciplined strain of anti-Semitism crystallised around the social credit theory. This theory, set out by the British engineer C. H. Douglas, was highly critical of bankers and financiers, believing that debt was being used to undermine people's rights. While by no means all creditists were anti-Semitic, the complaints made by Social Credit fit well with existing anti-Semitic theories that Jews controlled financial institutions. As such, many anti-Semites gathered around social credit organisations, and in some cases, became powerful.\n\nInitially, most supporters of social credit were supporters of the Labour Party, which meant that any anti-Semitic sentiments were considerably diluted. Later, however, an independent Social Credit Party was founded, and some allege that the new group contained many anti-Semitic elements. Gradually, rifts emerged in the party over anti-Semitic views, and the faction opposed to anti-Semitism was victorious. By the late 1960s, any anti-Semitic strain had been virtually expelled from the Social Credit Party. Many anti-Semites supported the League of Rights, an organisation originating in Australia which also had links to the social credit movement.\n\nUnlike some countries, New Zealand did not have any notable fascist organisations in the first half of the 20th century, although the New Zealand Legion was sometimes accused of having fascist leanings. There were no real equivalents to the British Union of Fascists or the Silver Legion of America, although certain individuals, notably Lionel Terry and Arthur Nelson Field, promoted white supremacist ideals.\n\nIn the post-war period, however, a number of fascist organisations became active. In 1968, the fascist activist Colin King-Ansell was jailed for an attack on a synagogue. The following year, he established the National Socialist Party of New Zealand, and contested a number of elections under its banner. Later, he led a group called the National Socialist White People's Party, modelled after the party established by George Lincoln Rockwell in the United States. In 1979, King-Ansell was fined for breaching the Race Relations Act by distributing several thousand anti-Semitic leaflets.\n\nAnother allegedly fascist group established in this period was the New Zealand National Front (NZNF). The National Front was established by Brian Thompson of Ashburton in 1968, although its initial operations were erratic. Eventually, in 1989, a new organisation called the Conservative Front (founded by Anton Foljambe) absorbed the National Front and adopted its name. The now-defunct New Zealand Democratic Nationalist Party also dates from this time period.\n\nIn 1981, a group called the New Force was founded. One of its founders and a member of its directorates was Kerry Bolton, who was also involved in the NZNF. In 1983, the New Force was renamed the Nationalist Workers Party.\n\nIn 1981, a visit by South Africa's rugby team generated huge controversy due to South Africa's apartheid policies at the time. Colin King-Ansell and a number of other fascist figures took part in counter-demonstrations against anti-tour protesters.\n\nIn the 1990s, there was something of a resurgence in New Zealand fascism. A number of gangs with fascist views, notably Unit 88, gained considerable public attention. Colin King-Ansell was once again involved, although he distanced himself from Unit 88 when the media focused on it. Later, in March 1997, King-Ansell founded the New Zealand Fascist Union, which described itself as being more closely modelled on Mussolini's Italy and Perón's Argentina than on Nazi Germany. The Fascist Union at one time claimed to have 500 members, the necessary number for official party registration, but the Union was never registered.\n\nAlso in 1997, Anton Foljambe resigned as leader of the National Front. Kyle Chapman resigned as leader in May 2005, and he and Foljambe have since established the moderate National Democrats Party. Kyle Chapman has established the Right Wing Resistance (RWR), an openly White Pride skinhead organization. The RWR has been distributing pamphlets throughout Christchurch, Auckland, Hastings, Nelson, Invercargill, Wellington and Palmerston North. RWR join with the National Front and small organisations at demonstrations. The introduction of black uniforms along the lines of Fascist Italy and the British Union of Fascists is now in place.\n\nFoljambe resigned from the National Democrats Party in 2007 and since then the party has been defunct.\n\nBrenton Harrison Tarrant, the Australian-born perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, was an admitted fascist who followed eco-fascism and admired Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British fascist organization British Union of Fascists (BUF), who is also quoted in the shooter's manifesto \"The Great Replacement\" (named after the French far-right theory of the same name).\n\nOrganisations\n\nPeople\n\n"}

Return of the child is to the member country rather than specifically to the left-behind parent.\n\nThe convention requires the return of a child who was a \"habitual resident\" in a contracting party immediately before an action that constitutes a breach of custody or access rights. The convention provides that all contracting states, as well as any judicial and administrative bodies of those contracting states, \"shall act expeditiously in all proceedings seeking the return of a children\" and that those institutions shall use the most expeditious procedures available to the end that final decision be made within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings.\n\nThe Convention provides that the removal or retention of a child is \"wrongful\" whenever:\n\nThese rights of custody may arise by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of the country of habitual residence.\n\nFrom the Convention's standpoint, the removal of a child by one of the joint holders without the consent of the other, is ... wrongful, and this wrongfulness derives in this particular case, not from some action in breach of a particular law, but from the fact that such action has disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law, and has interfered with their normal exercise.\n\nThe Convention mandates return of any child who was \"habitually resident\" in a contracting nation immediately before an action that constitutes a breach of custody. The Convention does not define the term \"habitual residence,\" but it is not intended to be a technical term. Instead, courts should broadly read the term in the context of the Convention's purpose to discourage unilateral removal of a child from that place in which the child lived when removed or retained, which should generally be understood as the child's \"ordinary residence.\" The child's \"habitual residence\" is not determined after the incident alleged to constitute a wrongful removal or retention. A parent cannot unilaterally create a new habitual residence by wrongfully removing or sequestering a child. Because the determination of \"habitual residence\" is primarily a \"fact based\" determination and not one which is encumbered by legal technicalities, the court must look at those facts, the shared intentions of the parties, the history of the children's location and the settled nature of the family prior to the facts giving rise to the request for return.\n\nThe Convention provides special rules for admission and consideration of evidence independent of the evidentiary standards set by any member nation. Article 30 provides that the Application for Assistance, as well as any documents attached to that application or submitted to or by the Central Authority are admissible in any proceeding for a child's return. The Convention also provides that no member nation can require legalization or other similar formality of the underlying documents in context of a Convention proceeding. Furthermore, the court in which a Convention action is proceeding \"may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognized or not in the State of habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable\" when determining whether there is a wrongful removal or retention under the Convention.\n\nThe Convention limits the defenses against return of a wrongfully removed or retained child. To defend against the return of the child, the defendant must establish to the degree required by the applicable standard of proof (generally determined by the \"lex fori\", i.e. the law of the state where the court is located):\n\n(a) that Petitioner was not \"actually exercising custody rights at the time of the removal or retention\" under Article 3; or\n\n(b) that Petitioner \"had consented to or acquiesced in the removal or retention\" under Article 13; or\n\n(c) that more than one year has passed from the time of wrongful removal or retention until the date of the commencement of judicial or administrative proceedings, under Article 12; or\n\n(d) that the child is old enough and has a sufficient degree of maturity to knowingly object to being returned to the Petitioner and that it is appropriate to heed that objection, under Article 13; or\n\n(e) that \"there is grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation,\" under Article 13(b); or\n\n(f) that return of the child would subject the child to violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, under Article 20.\n\nAs of July 2019, there are 101 parties to the Convention. The last state to accede to the Convention was Barbados in 2019.\n\n\n"}

Opened in 1926, it is a major provider of both in-patient and out-patient medical services.\n\nSMH is owned and operated by the University of Rochester and serves as its primary teaching hospital. It offers programs toward medical, dental, or graduate degrees through the School of Medicine and Dentistry. The hospital anchors the University's health care delivery network in the Rochester area. It serves as a primary community hospital and a regional trauma center for the Rochester area. Also part of the network are Golisano Children's Hospital, and URMC affiliate Highland Hospital.\n\nSMH offers care in 40 different specialties and is ranked as one of \"America's Best Hospitals\" by U.S. News & World Report, and has won the Consumer Choice Award for the best hospital in the area for 12 consecutive years. Strong has signature programs in cardiac care, cancer care, neurology, orthopedics and pediatrics. As an affiliated academic research hospital, patients have access to the latest treatments before they are widely available elsewhere.\n\nSMH is composed of a series of attached buildings. The different sections of the facility range from 3 to 11 floors, although not all areas are accessible to the public. The hospital offers 886 patient beds. Strong provides emergency medical services. SMH is a teaching hospital and patients may expect to interact with faculty, residents, fellows, interns and/or medical students.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Strong was the site of non-consensual human experimentation programs under supervision of the Manhattan Project and its successor, the United States Atomic Energy Commission. A building adjacent to the hospital and connected to it via tunnel, dubbed the \"Manhattan Annex,\" was constructed in 1943 as a field office for the Manhattan Project. Over a period of two years starting in 1945, a total of seventeen patients admitted to Strong for unrelated ailments were injected with a plutonium or uranium solution without their knowledge. The Atomic Energy Commission tracked the patients for the rest of their lives; after their deaths, the Commission exhumed their remains for testing. Surviving patients were later informed of the true nature of the experiments in 1974.\n\nIn recent years, federal regulations for human subject protection and ethical codes for research have been rigorously rewritten, in light of this experiment and others around the nation. Strong Memorial Hospital now has a unified human research protection program which has become a national leader in developing oversight programs to protect people who participate in research studies. In 2007 the University received the highest level of accreditation possible after demonstrating that extensive safeguards, exceeding federal regulations, were built into every level of its research operation. The Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP), an independent accrediting body based in Washington, D.C., granted a renewal of the approval in 2010 after an extensive review that included an intensive on-site inspection. The University’s oversight program includes all human research studies, even those that are exempt from regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration.\n\n"}

Like the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Children's Charter is a comprehensive instrument that sets out rights and defines universal principles and norms for the status of children. The ACRWC and the CRC are the only international and regional human rights treaties that cover the whole spectrum of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nIt calls for the creation of an African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Committee of Experts). Its mission is to promote and protect the rights established by the ACRWC, to practice applying these rights, and to interpret the disposition of the ACRWC as required of party states, African Union (AU) institutions, or all other institutions recognized by AU or by a member state.\n\nChildren in Africa are affected by many different types of abuse, including economic and sexual exploitation, gender discrimination in education and access to health, and their involvement in armed conflict. Other factors affecting African children include migration, early marriage, differences between urban and rural areas, child-headed households, street children and poverty. Furthermore, child workers in Sub-Saharan Africa account for about 80 million children or 4 out of every 10 children under 14 years old which is the highest child labour rate in the world.\n\nThe ACRWC defines a \"child\" as a human being below the age of 18 years. It recognises the child's unique and privileged place in African society and that African children need protection and special care. It also acknowledges that children are entitled to the enjoyment of freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, thought, religion, and conscience. It aims to protect the private life of the child and safeguard the child against all forms of economic exploitation and against work that is hazardous, interferes with the child's education, or compromises his or her health or physical, social, mental, spiritual, and moral development. It calls for protection against abuse and bad treatment, negative social and cultural practices, all forms of exploitation or sexual abuse, including commercial sexual exploitation, and illegal drug use. It aims to prevent the sale and trafficking of children, kidnapping, and begging of children.\n\nThe Children's Charter originated because the member states of the AU believed that the CRC missed important socio-cultural and economic realities particular to Africa. It emphasises the need to include African cultural values and experiences when dealing with the rights of the child in such as:\n\nThe fundamental principles guiding implementation of these rights include:\n\nAs of 2016, the ACRWC has been ratified by 47 of the 54 states of the African Union, and signed but not ratified by the remaining seven states. Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, South Sudan, and Tunisia have signed but not ratified the Charter. Morocco, a non-AU member state, has also not ratified.\n\n\nThe committee was formed in July 2001, one and half years after the Children's Charter came into force. The members are elected by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union. The criteria for the selection of members are:\n\nThe Committee of Experts meets twice each year, usually in May and November in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The exact dates depend on other items on the AU agenda around these times. They are empowered to receive and examine the country (\"state\") reports on the measures they have adopted to implement the provisions of the Children's Charter as well as the progress achieved regarding how the rights are being protected. The final protective function of the Committee of Experts is related to the investigations procedure. They are empowered to resort to any appropriate method of investigation in respect of any issue covered in the Children's Charter.\n\nThe current members of the ACERWC are (name, country, position):\n\nAs at October 2008, the elected Committee of Experts were (name, country, position):\n\n\nCountries which have ratified the Children's Charter must submit initial reports within two years of ratification or the entry into force of the Charter and every three years thereafter. In 2008, the Committee of Experts started the process of reviewing the first four state reports that had been received from Egypt, Mauritius, Nigeria and Rwanda in May 2008.\n\nThe state party report must contain specific information pertaining to children in their country. This includes political, legal, administrative issues that are linked to the requirements of the structure supplied by the Committee of Experts.\n\nIdeally it should be a comprehensive report that includes input from the state, civil society and other recognised bodies at the regional, continental, international levels. But usually, the state report doesn't include much information from civil society. So civil society organisations can submit a second or \"alternative\" report that contains the information that they have gathered.\n\nUntil very recently, this \"alternative\" report could only be accepted after the state had submitted their report. But now a process has been put into place whereby the state is given 18 months to submit their report, failing that, the \"alternative,\" civil society report will be accepted as that state's report.\n\nOnce received, the report then becomes available as a public document and it undergoes a process of:\n\nOnce the State Party and Alternative reports have been finalised, they are submitted to AU Secretariat for translation into the other working languages (English, French, Portuguese and Arabic). Then different Committee of Expert members review the report in a pre-sessional working group in order to identify issues for further discussion with the state and request for any other information that may help when considering the report. Other organisations, civil society organisations, UN groups, who have contributed alternative reports or who are considered relevant may be invited to attend the session on an informal basis. This is where civil society organisations can bring information to the process. A pre-sessional report is produced after this meeting.\n\nAfter the pre-sessional report has been produced, the members who have been appointed to review the State Party / Alternative Report meet to discuss an in-depth review of the report. Their findings are submitted to the respective state concerned and discussed with high level government representatives. There is no non-governmental organisation or civil society input at this level.\n\nAs a result of the in depth discussion, the Committee of Experts will identify problems, progress and differences in implementation of the Children's Charter by the State Party. These recommendations are called \"concluding observations\" and may include the following:\n\nAfter the initial State Party / Alternative report has been accepted, the state will then have to submit additional reports every 3 years. These reports are called \"periodic reports.\" This will allow for comparison with the previous report to determine whether there has been progress or if the situation has worsened.\n\nThere may also be follow-ups and country visits. The State Party / Alternative Report and recommendations are sent to the Summit of the Heads of States and Government. Civil society is also able to intervene every 3 years to encourage the state to make improvements ahead of the preparation of additional reports.\n\nCivil society organisations and international institutions have played a significant role in the work of the Committee of Experts and they have served as the backbone of the committee's work since inception. International non-governmental organizations have been particularly involved in the work of the committee, providing different kinds of expertise and financial support to most of the work.\n\nAlthough civil society organisation involvement was minimal in the beginning, over the intervening years they have since taken a pivotal role in ensuring that the committee fulfills its mandate and in providing the necessary support needed to facilitate its work. The adoption of the guidelines for granting observer status will now also ensure that more civil society organisations are able to formally participate and contribute in the process.\n\nAccording to the proposed guidelines for observer status, some of the ways civil society organisations and associations will be allowed to participate will include:\n\nThe guidelines encourage the formation of coalitions by civil society organisations with similar objectives. The following are the requirements for the participation of civil society organisations for observer status are:\n\nOnce the organisation has obtained observer status, it may request the Committee of Experts to include issues of interest on their agenda and to make oral statements at the sessions. They are entitled to receive information on the time, location and agenda of the sessions of the committee. The committee can invite a civil society organisation to participate in the deliberations of the meetings of the committee without a voting right.\n\nThe civil society organisations are also under an obligation to establish close relations with the committee and to hold regular consultations on all issues of common interest. Civil society organisations are required to submit reports on their activities every two years. When civil society organisations default on their obligations, the committee may suspend or withdraw the observer status.\n\nA communication is a complaint submitted to the Committee of Experts regarding a violation of the rights of children under the Children's Charter. The following are some guidelines for those wanting to submit a communication to the Committee of Experts:\n\nA communication must meet the following criteria:\n\nIf the communication meets the above requirements, then it may be considered by the Committee of Experts. When a complaint reaches the committee, a group will be assigned to work on it to decide if it is acceptable. If it is acceptable then they will give feedback both to the country where the problem is located. If there are gaps, then the committee will ask the country to take measures to protect the complainant while it is being investigated further.\n\nThe work on the complaint is confidential and is held in closed session debates. Once a decision has been taken, a communication is sent to the country's state department. A member on the Committee of Experts is designated to follow up and coordinate the process. Once the process has been completed, a report is sent to the Committee of the Heads of State and Government.\n\nChildren who are the authors or who are the victims in the communication process now have an opportunity to express their opinions to the Committee of Experts. This provision guarantees the cardinal principle of child participation in issues concerning them.\n\nInvestigations may be initiated because the Committee of Experts has received a communication indicating a serious violation. Investigation missions can be initiated either by a state referring a matter to the Committee of Experts, or the committee can undertake its own investigations, although the Committee may only visit a State Party if invited to do so by the government.\n\nTo ensure the investigative mission team has background knowledge of the situation, a preliminary report according to certain guidelines and based on available information is prepared before each investigation. The mission will meet with available state and non-state organisations and people in the country where they will be investigating.\n\nOnce the mission has finished its investigation, it has to release a preliminary result to the government and the media in the country of investigation. A final report is then prepared which incorporates the mission's recommendations. This mission report must be attached to the progress report of the Committee to the African Heads of State and Government.\n\nThe country that has been investigated has up to 6 months after the adoption of a decision by the Committee of Experts to submit a written reply on what they have done regarding the requirements or measures in the mission report.\n\nThe country's response should also include information on any measures in reaction to the recommendations made by the Committee after the mission. Civil society organisations and ‘specialised institutions’ like children's civil society organisations could also be requested to provide information on the situation of children in that state.\n\n\n\nOriginal material used for this section referenced the following sites:\n"}

Its use is thought to have begun in the 18th century and to have reached its height of popularity throughout the 19th and into the early 20th centuries. When unmounted from a musket or rifle, sword bayonets with their typical hilts and long blades also could be wielded as short swords. While modern military bayonets typically have knife blades, they are usually too short to be called sword bayonets and are more akin to fighting/utility knives.\n\nSword bayonets originated for use with muzzle-loading rifles. A typical example of an early sword bayonet is the 58 centimetre (23 inch) blade variety designed for the Infantry rifle, later called the Baker rifle of the Napoleonic era British Army.\n\nMost infantry would routinely keep bayonets fixed to their inaccurate smooth bore muskets throughout a battle. Close order ranks and squares presented a hedge of bayonets to the enemy, which was especially useful for deterring cavalry. But a fixed bayonet - a pound or so of extra metal on the front of a firearm - seriously affects a firearm’s balance and hampers accurate shooting. However, Mosin-Nagant rifles using cruciform and dagger bayonets were arsenal zeroed with them affixed (or extended) as they affect point-of-impact via barrel harmonics, and in the case of Imperial Russian and Soviet battle doctrine dictated they were always affixed (with few exceptions). A rifleman usually fought without a fixed bayonet since accuracy was the whole purpose of their rifled weapon. He therefore required a side-arm that could be drawn and used instantly in an emergency so his bayonet had a cutting edge and a grippable hilt. That such bayonets were far heavier than standard socket bayonets was not a disadvantage since they were rarely fixed. Most riflemen found it worked better for cutting brush and roasting meat over a fire (See Rifleman Harris, Costello's, Simmons's diaries).\n\nOn occasion riflemen did form up in close order. Since rifles were shorter than muskets their bayonets needed to be longer to produce the same total length; the sword bayonet answered this need.\n\nAs well as rifle regiments, other soldiers whose battlefield role did not involve standing shoulder to shoulder in ranks, notably sergeants, also came to use sword bayonets. By the end of the nineteenth century all infantry had become riflemen and the sword bayonet had become the standard infantry bayonet.\n\nBayonets lost their popularity after World War I. While sword bayonets can be effective as short swords, they proved to be too unwieldy in cramped quarters in trench warfare, although spike bayonets continued to be used throughout most of the 20th century. A shorter version of the sword bayonet, the knife bayonet, was developed. Today, the majority of modern bayonets are knife bayonets.\n\nWith the appearance of the hiltless sword bayonet, such as the socket-mounted variety, their use on the end of the musket or rifle also became a hindrance during the reloading of the muzzle-loaded longarm, (a common problem to all muzzle-loading infantry weapons). A bayonet of similar style and dimension was used on the Lee–Enfield rifle of the early 20th century.\n\nThe advantages of sword bayonets over spike bayonets are evident. Where a spike bayonet turns the rifle into a spear, a sword bayonet turns it into a glaive. Unlike spike bayonets, which can be used only for thrusting, sword bayonets can also be used for slashing, except for the épée bayonets. Twisting a sword bayonet in the wound was especially lethal. Before the advent of modern medicine after World War I, a soldier struck by a sword bayonet was very unlikely to survive.\n\nWhile most sword bayonets have straight blades, a popular variant in the 19th century featured sinuous, S-curved blades like those found on the Balkan's and Middle-East's sword called the yataghan. Today, sword bayonets of this style are said to have \"yataghan\" blades, or to be \"yataghan-bladed\".\n\n\n "}

General William Wilson \"Buffalo Bill\" Quinn (November 1, 1907 – September 11, 2000) and his wife, Sara Bette Williams (January 27, 1918 – September 26, 2004). Both are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Quinn has two siblings—Donna of Oakland, California, and William Jr. of Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nHer father was an infantry officer who also served as an intelligence officer and played a key role in the transition of the United States' intelligence service from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As a US Army colonel in World War II, he helped coordinate the invasion of southern France in 1944 and captured Hermann Göring. Though he was not present, his regiment liberated Dachau concentration camp; he arrived the next day, when he heard the news. From 1964 to 1966, he commanded the Seventh Army in Germany. Quinn wrote about his career in an autobiography, \"Buffalo Bill Remembers\".\n\nFor many years, the Quinns lived on Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C., where Bette Quinn was known for her cooking and entertaining. Sally Quinn reported in CC Goldwater's HBO film \"Mr. Conservative\" that Senator Barry Goldwater spent much time with the Quinns, often staying at their home, since his wife decided to remain in Arizona rather than D.C. while Congress was in session.\n\nQuinn attended and graduated from Smith College in 1963.\n\nA Savannah, Georgia, native and Smith College graduate, Quinn began at \"The Washington Post\" with very little experience: reportedly called by Ben Bradlee after a report of her pajama party in celebration of the election to Congress of Barry Goldwater Jr., the job interview included the following exchange.\n\n\"Can you show me something you've written?\" asked Managing Editor Benjamin Bradlee. \"I've never written anything,\" admitted Quinn. Pause. \"Well,\" said Bradlee, \"nobody's perfect.\" (A profile in \"Vanity Fair\" attributes the \"Nobody's perfect\" line to editorial-page editor Philip L. Geyelin.)\n\nHowever, Quinn soon demonstrated, as a reporter for the paper's style section, a talent for drawing out the subjects of her interviews and profiles. Henry Kissinger said, \"[\"The Post\" reporter] Maxine Cheshire makes you want to commit murder. Sally Quinn makes you want to commit suicide.\" A notable incident of her career was her claim that Zbigniew Brzezinski, then the National Security Advisor, jokingly opened his fly in front of a reporter, a claim \"The Post\" retracted the following day.\n\nQuinn was critical of President Bill Clinton during the impeachment trial, stating that he had \"fouled the nest\". Quinn had a long-standing animus for the Clintons, possibly due to a perceived snub by First Lady Hillary Clinton, who declined a party invitation from Quinn. Regarding Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr, she wrote: \"Similarly, independent counsel Ken Starr is not seen by many Washington insiders as an out-of-control prudish crusader. Starr is a Washington insider, too. He has lived and worked here for years. He had a reputation as a fair and honest judge. He has many friends in both parties. Their wives are friendly with one another and their children go to the same schools.\" Harry Jaffe wrote in \"Salon\" that Quinn's condemnation of Bill Clinton's adultery rang hollow coming from someone who broke up the marriage of her boss Ben Bradlee before going on to marry Bradlee herself.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, \"The Washington Post\" published \"Sally Quinn's The Party: No 'dueling' Bradlee weddings, just scheduling mistake\", in print and online. The column alluded to Bradlee family dysfunction, and discussed her son's wedding, which she scheduled on the same day as the wedding of her husband's granddaughter. The column was considered inappropriate and reader backlash was immediate, criticizing Quinn for airing family laundry and \"Washington Post\" editors for printing it. By February 24, the \"Post\" canceled her column, which had been appearing in the religion section of the print edition. This was Quinn's last column for the printed newspaper.\n\nQuinn continued to write for the Post's Onfaith blog at least through 2015. She remains listed as a contributor.\n\nIn August 1973, Quinn tried her hand at television, joining CBS News reporter Hughes Rudd as co-anchor of the \"CBS Morning News\". Ninety minutes before her television debut on August 6, 1973, Quinn collapsed while trying to fight the flu.\n\nQuinn's ad libs during the show's first week tended toward the inappropriate—in one episode, following a report on the children of California migrant farm workers, she quipped that child labor \"was how I felt when my mother and father made me clean up my room.\" Quinn left the \"CBS Morning News\" after the February 1, 1974, telecast. She chronicled her short television career in the bestselling book \"We're Going to Make You a Star\".\n\nQuinn was the third wife of Ben Bradlee, her former boss at \"The Washington Post\", until his death in 2014. They married on October 20, 1978. In 1979, Quinn and Bradlee purchased Grey Gardens in East Hampton, New York from Edith Bouvier Beale, known as \"Little Edie,\" for $220,000 () under the terms they were not to tear down the house. Little Edie told them \"All it needs is a coat of paint!\" The couple then spent several years remodeling the home and fully restored it to its former glory. In February 2017 Quinn put Grey Gardens on the market and sold it for $15.5 million on December 20, 2017.\n\nQuinn and Bradlee had one child, Quinn Bradlee, born in 1982. Their son was born when Quinn was 41 and Bradlee was 61. In 2009, they appeared with Quinn on the Charlie Rose show on PBS and spoke of Quinn being born with velo-cardio-facial syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion and Shprintzen syndrome (named after Dr. Robert Shprintzen who first identified the disorder in 1978 and who also diagnosed Bradlee). Quinn wrote of her son's learning disabilities and attendance at special schools in a 2006 blog article \"What My Son Taught Me About God.\"\n\nIn 2017 Quinn published a book entitled \"Finding Magic\" in which she described herself as a Christian who also believes in the occult and the power of magic. She recalled her growing up in a family of Scottish origin which practiced voodoo. She recalled her mother putting hexes on two people who later died. She further described performing hex magic herself on three people, two of whom died shortly after.\n\nIn addition to her newspaper and television journalism, Quinn served as social secretary for Cherif Guellal.\n\nShe had a cameo role in \"Born Yesterday\", the 1993 remake of the 1950 romantic comedy. Quinn was the subject of six portraits made by American artist Andy Warhol, and was known as a famous hostess in the 1970s and 1980s; most recently commented on in the play \"The City of Conversation\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1966504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966504", "title": "Sacred (video game)", "text": "Sacred (video game)\n\nSacred is an action role-playing game for Microsoft Windows and Linux released in 2004. It takes place on the magical continent of Ancaria, with characters of various races (dark elf, vampiress, dwarf, etc.) each with their own missions. More than 1.8 million copies of the game were sold worldwide. Two expansion packs were released for the game in 2004 and 2005. In 2008 Linux Game Publishing announced that they would port the game to the Linux operating system.\n\n\"Sacred\" was developed by Studio II Software and Ascaron Entertainment and published in 2004 by Encore in the USA release.\n\nUpon beginning the game, players are given a choice to start with one of six different character types:Gladiator, Dark Elf, Wood Elf, Vampiress, Battle-Mage and Seraphim. The Daemon and Dwarf were additional characters added in the expansion \"Sacred Underworld\" and included in \"Sacred Gold\".\n\nEach character begins in a different part of the area around a town in Ancaria (the continent that \"Sacred\" takes place within), and with a different starting quest. For example, the Gladiator starts in a colosseum, enslaved by his master, while the Seraphim starts in a church. The Dark Elf starts on a cliff with a Wood Elf companion. Throughout the game, the characters all receive different sub-quests.\n\nEach character class is also restricted to a certain set of items, and has a different set of skills. To increase these skill levels, characters must find runes that correspond to those skills, a rather novel system in contrast to the more mainstream model of skill points. Some character classes have identical skills, but the runes from one class cannot be used to advance skills in another class. Runes may be traded and used for crafting.\n\n\"Sacred\" features a vast array of items that can be obtained from shops, various containers (chests, barrels, graves...), dead monsters or \"magical hiding places\" in many of the rocks and bushes throughout Ancaria, which are indicated by a yellow sparkle. Many of the items can be only equipped by one type of character, like \"wings\", which can only be equipped by a Seraphim.\n\nThere are also several potion types, such as the typical health heal, but there are other types, like \"Potions of Undead death\", which stops Undead from reviving once players kill them, and \"Potions of Concentration\", which regenerate players' combo attacks so they can be used faster. There are no mana-heal potions in \"Sacred\", because mana is not a feature of the game. Also, monsters occasionally drop a rune that increases a certain skill for a certain character, if used.\n\nIf the player owns a horse several different types of saddles can be bought to be used on it. These saddles increase the speed, defense, and damage done by the horse. Only one horse may be owned at a time, and the horse can be damaged and killed.\n\nThe names of items are in five different colors, (white, blue, yellow, brown, green) which represent different quality classes of equipment:\"\n\nSometimes, a monster drops a set item. Much like in \"Diablo II\" these set items will become much more powerful when gathered together and are very useful and sought-after in multiplayer games. However, this is not to say that unique items are inferior to set items. Unique items are usually individually better than set items.\n\nSome items also can be imbued with better stats. If players take an item with a number of \"slots,\" indicated by small boxes in the inventory screen, they will be able to imbue it by taking it to a blacksmith and then using either jewellery, a rune, skeleton skull or one of the blacksmith's techniques on it up to as many times as there are slots in it. Once imbued players can remove one rune or piece of jewelry from it, but all other items in the slots are lost when they do this. Though players cannot use a rune or jewelry which is not of their class, they can socket it in an item to gain the benefit of its magical and possible stat-raising properties.\n\nEvery character in \"Sacred\" has a different set of skills that are available to them. The only way to obtain them is to find a rune of that particular skill and use it to make it available to use for players. Each character has between 11 and 22 different skills that can be unlocked and used. To increase their level in a skill, players must find another rune for that skill and use it. There are also several \"combo masters\" spread throughout Ancaria, which can combine up to four separate skills into a combo, which players can use in the game. The combo masters can also trade runes they cannot use or do not need for a rune of their choice.\n\nA great Sakkara demon was conjured into existence by the necromancer Shaddar. The conjuring went wrong, and the Sakkara demon is now loose in the world of Ancaria. The heroes must find the five elements of Caesarian (wind, fire, earth, water, void), and use them to defeat the monster. They meet Prince Valor, and he thanks them for rescuing Wilbur and orders them to report to Baron DeMordre to bring reinforcements to stop the Orc invasion. The Baron betrays them and Wilbur is killed. With his dying breaths he warns the hero to report to the Prince that the Baron has betrayed them. The hero arrives at the orc invasion and finds most of Valor's troops have been slaughtered; only Sargent Treveille is left dying and tells the hero to find Baroness Vilyia - she knows where the prince is. They find Vilyia, and she leads them to Valor in the forest, where he and his surviving troops take refuge. Each hero has different objectives along the way, but eventually, they all lead up to this one final quest. After killing the traitor DeMordre and reclaiming the throne, the hero goes to the dungeon to summon the Sakkara demon and kills it. However, after claiming the heart of Ancaria, Shaddar reveals himself and captures Vilyia, and the hero pursues him into his castle to rescue Vilyia and defeat Shaddar.\n\nThe whole of \"Sacred\" takes place on the continent of Ancaria, where there are several towns and villages to be visited. Even when players begin the game more than 70% of Ancaria is already available to be traveled on. To the south of Ancaria, there is a vast desert and lava-ridden plains. In the north, there is a wall of mountains and an icy backdrop.\nIn both the east and the west there are large forests, blocking the way and stopping further travel.\nIn the game there is an option to buy horses, which can be used for faster travel and to battle opponents, but will not affect players' ability to traverse difficult terrain in most situations.\n\nThe game was originally started by developer Ikarion as an adaptation of the role-playing game \"The Dark Eye\". After Ikarion went defunct, Ascaron bought it out and continued the project with an original story, renaming it \"Sacred\".\n\n\"Sacred\" was a commercial success. By August 2004, it had sold over 100,000 units in the United States and 400,000 units in Europe. It sold 1.5 million units worldwide, including its expansion pack, by July 2006. \"GameStar\" highlighted it as a rare crossover hit for Germany, with significant sales volume outside German-speaking countries; as of 2006, it had sold 300,000 units in the United States. It received a \"Platinum\" award from the (aDeSe), for more than 80,000 sales in Spain during its first 12 months. Spain accounted for 250,000 units by 2006. Worldwide sales rose above 1.8 million copies by 2007 and 2 million by 2009. In April 2004, it received a \"Gold\" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. It achieved \"Platinum\" status, for 250,000 sales, by early 2005.\n\n\"Sacred\" garnered average to good reviews from the media. \"1up\" called it \"Diablo for masochists\", while \"IGN\" called it \"A diamond in the rough\".\n\nThe editors of \"PC Gamer US\" presented \"Sacred\" with their \"Best Roleplaying Game 2004\" award. Greg Vederman of the magazine wrote that it \"provides the loot addict with a deliciously strong dose of the good stuff.\"\n\n\"Sacred Plus\" is a free expansion pack released in October 2004. It adds 2 regions, monsters, quests, items.\n\n\"Sacred Underworld\" is an expansion pack developed by Studio II Software and Ascaron Entertainment, and released in August 2005. Two new characters were added next to the six existing ones: Daemon and Dwarf. The story picks up after the events in \"Sacred\", taking your character to the Underworld of Ancaria to rescue baroness Vilya.\n\nOn the review aggregator GameRankings, \"Underworld\" had an average score of 74% based on 12 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 10 reviews — indicating mixed or average reviews. \"Underworld\" was a finalist for \"PC Gamer US\"s \"Best Expansion Pack 2005\" award, which ultimately went to \"\".\n\nJason Ocampo of GameSpot gave \"Underworld\" a rating of 7.0 out of 10, saying the game is \"an example of a \"Diablo\"-like action role-playing game taken to the extreme.\" Comparing the game to \"Sacred\", Ocampo said it \"offers more of the same, but at a ramped-up level.\" Ocampo said the game looks good but that \"Hacking your way every 10 feet can be a chore.\" Ocampo also noted that it was nice that the game is set in a \"predefined world, unlike the randomly generated levels of \"Diablo\".\"\n\n\"Sacred Gold\" is a compilation released in August 2005. It contains the main game and the two expansions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966508", "title": "Columbia House", "text": "Columbia House\n\nThe Columbia House brand was introduced in the early 1970s by the Columbia Records division of CBS, Inc. as an umbrella for its mail-order music clubs, the primary incarnation of which was the Columbia Record Club, established in 1955. It had a significant market presence in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. In 2005, longtime competitor BMG Direct Marketing, Inc. (formerly the RCA Music Service or RCA Victor Record Club) purchased Columbia House and consolidated operations. In 2008, the company (as well as book club operator Bookspan) was acquired by private investment group Najafi Companies, and its name was changed to Direct Brands, Inc.\n\nAlthough Direct Brands shut down music mail-order operations in mid-2009, it continued to use the Columbia House brand to market videos in the U.S. and Canada, selling DVDs and Blu-rays via the controversial practice of negative option billing. DB Media's Canadian assets ceased operating on December 10, 2010, and all staff were dismissed, while U.S. operations continue as usual. In December 2012, the company was sold to Pride Tree Holdings, Inc. In 2013, the company changed its name to Filmed Entertainment Inc. The sale of the DVD division at bankruptcy auction was announced August 10, 2015.\n\nColumbia Record Club was formed in 1955 by CBS/Columbia Records as an experiment to market music directly by mail, spurring sales to rural consumers and heading off competition from mail-order companies from outside the record industry. New members to the club were enticed with a free record just for joining. To appease brick-and-mortar retailers, titles in the club's catalog were only made available six months (later, three months) after retail release, and retailers that helped recruit members got a 20% commission. By the end of that year, the club had 125,175 members who had purchased 700,000 records ($1.174 million net). The operation grew so quickly that, in 1956, it was moved from New York City to a new home base: a distribution center in Terre Haute, Indiana, a railway-accessible city where Columbia had recently opened a record pressing facility. Within a year, the club had 687,652 members and had sold 7 million records ($14.888 million net) and, by 1963, it commanded 10% of the recorded music retail market.\n\nIn the late 1950s, both RCA Victor and Capitol Records began licensing programs of their own, but the three record clubs rarely allowed any of their own labels' releases to be marketed by rivals. For example, Columbia recordings were not available from the RCA Victor Record Club, and RCA recordings were unavailable through the Columbia Record Club.\n\nIn 1958, facing the loss of members who wanted a wider variety of records, the club began manufacturing and marketing records for certain competing labels (including Verve, Mercury, Warner Bros., Kapp, Vanguard, United Artists, and Liberty). Rival clubs operated by RCA and Capitol offered only their own labels' products at the time. Licensors were guaranteed a minimum number of sales, but were held to exclusive, restrictive contracts, which led to price-fixing allegations against the club in 1962, followed by 7 years of mostly ineffective litigation. The licensing program continued and expanded in the 1960s as the music industry grew and changed.\n\nThe Columbia Record Club began marketing stereo records and equipment in 1959, reel-to-reel recordings (via the Columbia Reel-To-Reel Club) in 1960, 8-track cartridges (via the Columbia Cartridge Club) in 1966, and cassettes (via the Columbia Cassette Club) in 1969.\n\nThe Columbia Record Club was also notable in continuing to issue product in formats no longer available on the commercial market. After the major record labels quit releasing albums on reel to reel tape format, Columbia still continued to make select new titles available on reel tape up until 1984. 1982 was the approximate year the 8-track tape disappeared from record stores yet Columbia continued to release new titles in the format until 1988 and finally after the major record labels abandoned the vinyl LP format in 1989, Columbia issued select new titles on vinyl until 1992. In all three cases, the new releases on the abandoned formats were usually limited to the new \"Selection of the Month\" title (although the country music Selection of the Month had never been available on reel tape unless the album had possible crossover appeal to the Pop/Rock or Easy Listening club members).\n\nBy the early 1970s, \"Columbia House\" had become an overarching brand for the various divisions, led by the Columbia Record Club, later renamed the Columbia Record & Tape Club. By 1975, membership was over 3 million.\n\nIn 1982, the CBS Video Club, which had formed the previous year as the CBS Video Library, became part of the Columbia House family. Also, during that same time period, Columbia House and The Cannon Group founded the UK-exclusive mail-order VHS distribution service Videolog. Sony acquired the CBS Records Group, including Columbia House, in 1988, then at 6 million members. Bertelsmann Music Group had recently acquired RCA Records and changed the name of Columbia House's only surviving rival, RCA Music Service (formerly RCA Victor Record Club), to BMG Music Service.\n\nIn 1991, the CBS Records Group was renamed as Sony Music Entertainment and Sony sold half of Columbia House to Time Warner and merged in Time-Life's video and music clubs. Membership was over 10 million at the end of that year. The influence of Columbia House and other music clubs reached its peak in 1994 accounting for 15.1 percent of all CD sales. In 1996, club membership was at 16 million. That year, the Columbia House website was launched.\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel club, the Columbia Record Club of Canada, was operated by the Canadian branch of CBS Records from the late 1950s until membership and financial problems led to its apparent demise in 1977. It was relaunched in 1979 as the Canadian Music Club, attracting 100,000 members by the end of that year.\n\nIn mid-1999, a merger was announced between Columbia House and struggling online retailer CDNow, an independent, publicly owned company that had funding and other partnerships with Columbia House and its owners Sony and Time-Warner. The merger was abandoned in early 2000, with Columbia House's poor finances and stiff competition from online giant Amazon.com cited as factors. Within months, CDNow was purchased by Bertelsmann, which partially merged it with BMG Direct into a venture called BeMusic. CDNow was taken over and merged into Amazon the following year. By 2001, music clubs accounted for less than eight percent of all CD sales, coinciding with the ascent of Internet shops and retail outlets such as Amazon and Wal-Mart, which offered music at similar discounts without subscriptions.\n\nIn 2001, a security breach in the Columbia House website exposed thousands of customer names, addresses and portions of credit card numbers, leaving private information about customers vulnerable to exploitation. The issue involved a particular section of the website, which could easily be accessed by deleting a portion of the website address in the address bar, discovered by customer Mark Alway. Upon the discovery of the breach, he emailed the Columbia House staff who were quick to respond to the problem. This event gave rise to concerns over the website's capability of keeping private information secure from hackers or devastating scams. Although no information was reportedly obtained from the temporary breach according to Columbia House, industry professionals were quick to point out that the simple error was the consequence of negligent handling of customer information.\n\nIn 2002, Sony and AOL Time Warner sold 85% of Columbia House to The Blackstone Group L.P., a New York-based investment firm. The next year, the possibility of a merger of Columbia House and Blockbuster Inc. was reported in the \"Wall Street Journal\", Associated Press reports, and trade publications. Although the owners were said to be in talks, the merger never materialized.\n\nIn 2005, longtime competitor BMG Direct Marketing, Inc., then the current owners of BMG Music Service, acquired Columbia House, renamed the merged company BMG Columbia House, Inc., and consolidated operations under the BMG Music Service name.\n\nIn 2008, the company, including its Canadian branch, was acquired from Sony BMG by investment firm JMCK Corp., a Najafi Group company based in Phoenix, Arizona, and the name was changed to Direct Brands, Inc. Direct Brands consolidated the remaining facilities, and shut down music mail-order operations on June 30, 2009. However, Direct Brands continued to operate a DVD and Blu-ray Disc club under the Columbia House brand in both the U.S. and Canada. The Columbia House name is still owned by Sony Music Entertainment, and is used under license.\n\nIn December 2010, the Canadian branch went into bankruptcy, and its websites began redirecting visitors to a letter of explanation from the companies' trustees in bankruptcy.\n\nThe parent of the Columbia House music and DVD clubs announced on August 10, 2015, that it plans to sell its Columbia House DVD Club business, which sells recorded movies and TV series directly to consumers, through a bankruptcy auction.\n\nIn December 2015, Columbia House's owner, John Lippman, announced his intention to begin a vinyl subscription service that will allow subscribers the ability to choose which records and genres of music they receive.\n\nWhile Sony Music still owns the Columbia House trademark, Edge Line Ventures LLC is the current licensee of the Columbia House name.\n\nFollowing the sale of Columbia House to BMG and continuing after the sale to Direct Brands, Columbia House has attracted criticism for its business practices, some of which are outlined here:\n\nMembership constituted an agreement whereby the customer agree to purchase a minimum number of movies at regular list price. To \"join\", or enter a legal obligation, the customer agreed to purchase one discounted movie at the beginning, which is sent out as part of a \"welcome package.\" Over the term of the agreement the minimum number of list price movies must be bought. Twenty-one times per year, the company informs each customer of the \"Director's Selection\" movie. The customer is asked to respond within 10 days whether or not he or she wants to buy this movie, which is offered at a discount provided that the response is received by Columbia House \"within the specified time.\" Failure to respond results in having that movie shipped at full list price. If the customer responds negatively but in time, the idea is that the movie is not sent or charged to the customer's account. In specified circumstances, \"memberships\" are available, whereby the customer is not required to respond to Director Selection mailings unless he or she wants to buy the movie. When such memberships expire, the old rules return where a response is required in time to prevent shipping of full price movies without customer input. Customers are not reminded when those rules change. The customer also has access to a large variety of other movies, which are advertised by mail and online towards the customer. Only full price purchases deplete that minimum purchase obligation. Purchases are not cumulative, meaning that two movies bought at ten dollars each do not deplete the minimum list price movie purchases by one movie. If the minimum number of movies has not been purchased by the end of the term, the monetary worth of those movies is charged to the customers' accounts. If any purchases have been made using Columbia House's point of sale device, either credit cards or debit cards linked to credit card accounts, then those accounts are automatically debited. The company will either mail or email a reminder notice prior to the commitment expiring, giving the customer the opportunity to purchase the required purchase obligation before they are charged for any commitment or contract charges. Likewise, backordered movies are automatically debited to those accounts when they become available, without further notification to the customers. Failure to clear such purchases result in collections efforts by Columbia House against the customers.\n\nColumbia House offers a point system, where movies bought result in “points” or “Fun Cash” (“Dividend Dollars” was the term used when the movies came in VHS format, which is no longer the case). Fun Cash does not transfer from one subscription to another. There are a number of restrictions to the use of Fun Cash, which generally make regular re-enrollment a lower cost and more tangible option for those interested in savings. The current point system being used is called Bonus Points, and works under the same idea as Fun Cash.\n\nColumbia House has made forays into other media besides music and movies. For a few years, Columbia House offered a CD-ROM club, allowing customers to buy computer games. It is now allowing members to buy video games from its site, but thus far has not offered a specific club for this. One can also enter into agreements concerning the regular purchase of \"box sets\", which are compilations of popular TV series. One agreement, allows customers access to any of Columbia House's products. Everything can be sourced via the company website.\n\nColumbia House practices negative option billing, a form of commercial distribution in which services are automatically supplied to the consumers until a specific cancellation order is issued. The practice has drawn many complaints from consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has published information to protect customers against this practice, specifically referencing a $0.49/video offering.\n\nIn December 2008, BMG Music Service (now yourmusic.com) supposedly sold an unknown number of fraudulent debt claims to a collection agency, National Credit Solutions. Supposed delinquents were not made known of their debt and most had not made purchases with the company for at least five years. Victims of the sale of false debt claims were not made known of either their debt or the account opened with National Credit Solutions. Most victims learned of the collections agency account when they were denied for a loan, had credit cards canceled, or checked their credit reports.\n\nOn August 4, 2011, a nationwide class action suit was filed against Columbia House (Direct Brands Inc.) seeking monetary damages and an injunction stopping Direct Brands Inc. alleged business practices of unauthorized credit card charges, inability to cancel, unwanted products being mailed to homes and several other alleged issues.\n\nAs of 2010, this business had an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB because of a failure to respond to complaints. This company also has an unsatisfactory record because of a pattern of complaints. Specifically, complainants allege receiving merchandise and/or bills for merchandise from BMG/Columbia House for CDs and/or DVDs that they did not order. Complainants further allege that they did not join BMG/Columbia House and do not know how the company obtained their information and that the company's phone line and website do not provide live customer service representatives to help resolve these issues.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966532", "title": "Horsham, Victoria", "text": "Horsham, Victoria\n\nHorsham () is a regional city in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia. Located on a bend in the Wimmera River, Horsham is approximately northwest of the state capital Melbourne. In June 2018, Horsham had an estimated population of 16,514. It is the most populous city in Wimmera, and the main administrative centre for the Rural City of Horsham local government area. It is the eleventh largest city in Victoria after Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Wodonga, Mildura, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Traralgon, and Wangaratta.\n\nAn early settler James Monckton Darlot named the settlement after the town of Horsham in his native England. It grew throughout the latter 19th and early 20th centuries as a centre of Western Victoria's wheat and wool industry, becoming the largest city in the Wimmera and Western Victoria by the early 1910s. Horsham was declared a city in 1949 and was named Australia's Tidiest Town in 2001.\n\nRecent archaeological research of rock shelters by La Trobe University in the Grampians found clear evidence of Aboriginal occupation 3–4,000 years ago, and the possibility of occupation up to 22,000 years ago. The rock shelters would have provided reliable access to water and a base to hunt megafauna on the plains of the Wimmera. Then \"around the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, the Jardwa people were being forced south by either a Murray or northern Victorian tribe called the Wotjol\". By the time of European exploration and settlement, the Jardwadjali language (a dialect of the Wemba-wemba language group common across most of Western Victoria)) was well established across the southern portion of the Wimmera region. Wimmera Aboriginal people hunted and traded widely, with stone for their tools coming up from the Grampians in the Ararat district. Relations between Europeans and Aboriginal people, as across much of Australia, were mixed, featuring both conflict and cooperation. One of the last Aboriginal missions in Victoria, Ebenezer Mission, was run successfully by the Moravian Order during the 1870s and 1880s, providing education and employment for the region's Indigenous people before it fell into decline in the 1890s and closed in 1902.\n\nMajor Thomas Mitchell was the first European to pass through the area, naming the Wimmera River on 18 July 1836. After the explorer Edward Eyre passed through the region seeking an overland route between Port Philip and Adelaide, he reported to \"The Adelaide Gazette\" on 14 July 1838 that the region was \"well-watered and affording good pasturage for stock.\"\nThe Squatters were the first European settlers in the Wimmera. William J Bracewell made the first claim, claiming 100,000 acres at Dooen on 10 August 1842. Although Captain Chris Lewis was the first resident of the Wimmera, settling at Ledcourt Station at Glenorchy in 1840. Charles Carter, a Squatter from Van Diemen's Land established his property \"Brim Springs\" nearby in 1845. The Wimmera region was made part of the Portland Bay district in 1843 and then became its own district in 1846. Land ownership was formalised in 1847, and the \"Wimmera squatters wasted no time in securing their land cheaply as leasehold.\" George Langlands, a merchant from Melbourne was encouraged by James Darlot to move to the Wimmera region and open a store. Langlands reached the Wimmera and opened a general store in October 1849 on what is now the corner of Darlot and Hamilton Street. A Post Office had opened a year earlier on 1 July 1848. By 1851 the small village of Horsham had been established, consisting of an estimated 18 homes.\n\nThe 1851 census counted 2,019 people living in the Wimmera region. The Victorian gold rush connected Horsham with the rest of the state, when it became a stop-over point for the Gold Escort in 1851. Governance was formalised in 1858 when the Wimmera area was included in region's first electoral district, covering an area from the Murry River in the north, then south to the Wimmera River and then east to the Grampian Range. Then in 1862 the Horsham District Road Board was established, which later evolved into the Horsham Shire with the passing of the \"Local Government Act\" in 1864. The electric telegraph was connected in 1875 and the main railway from Melbourne reached Horsham in 1879. The Horsham Borough Council and the Shire of Wimmera operated the McKenzie Creek Tramway from the town to a stone quarry, approximately to the south. The horse tramway opened within the town in 1885 but had ceased operating by 1927. Special picnic trains operated from time to time conveying residents in open wagons along the McKenzie Creek Tramway. \n\nThe 1870s saw significant economic and demographic growth in Horsham. During this period the foundry, the hospital, and the Horsham Agricultural Society were established, with the first Horsham show held in 1876. Geoffrey Blainey, notes in his \"History of Victoria\", that the Victorian railway building boom of the 1870s enabled large-scale wheat production to begin in the Wimmera. He also describes a unique migration of German farmers, mostly Lutherans from South Australia, who travelled across east in covered-wagons along with their families and herds of cattle and then settled in the Wimmera district. Blainey writes that \"nothing in Australian history so resembles the opening of the American west as this trek of farmers to the Victorian plains in the 1870s'.\" Farming production in the region dramatically increased, and wheat was established as the dominant agricultural crop.\n\nAlthough flooding along the Wimmera River was noted during the early period of the settlement, the first major flood was recorded in 1883 with the first flood causing serious damage occurring in 1889, when several buildings and the tramway were damaged. Several serious floods then occurred along the Wimmera River over the next five decades, in 1894, 1903, 1909, 1915 and then in 1923. The flood in 1923 was the third largest on record. In response to this history of flooding, the council successfully applied in 1946 for money from the State Parliamentary Public Works Committee for flood management.\nMen from Horsham fought in the First World War. \"By mid-August 1914 the first of Horsham's soldiers were given a rousing civic farewell at the Town Hall.\" However conscription \"divided the community\", with the Anti-Conscription League noting the high rate (6%) of conscription in the Horsham district. \"The Discharged Soldier Settlement Act\" of 1917 was created to give returning soldiers a head-start establishing farms in regional Australia. According to the act returning soldiers with farm-experience could apply for a block of land. By 1919 2,933 ex-servicemen had taken up the opportunity. The average size of the land grants were . When World War Two started, men from Horsham again volunteered. The war effort was enthusiastically embraced, for example in May 1940, when King George VI made a Commonwealth-wide call to prayer, 1,800 people attended a religious service at the town hall. Returning servicemen were again given the opportunity to take up land grants at the end of the war, with the average size of the blocks being between .\n\nHorsham's population had reached 6,388 in 1947 and so it was declared a city on 24 May 1949. In 1950 Horsham celebrated its Centenary with a parade through the city. But then tragedy struck on 24 February 1951 when a train and bus collided at a level crossing on Dimboola Road, resulting in 11 deaths. The Horsham Streetscape was dramatically remodelled in the 1960s when planning laws were changed and shopfront verandahs were removed from the Post Office, The Bull and Mouth, and The White Hart pubs. The Horsham City council installed the first parking meters on Firebrace Street in 1963. A major fire damaged the new State Public Office on McLachlan Street in 1971. In 1995, the Rural City of Horsham was formed through the amalgamation of the Horsham City, Wimmera and Aprapiles Shires. Horsham was then named Australia's Tidiest Town in 2001 and was also named Victoria's tidiest town in 2015.\n\nThe Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 affected Horsham, with area burnt around the city's fringe including the golf club and eight homes destroyed in the Haven area. Horsham experienced significant flooding in successive years in 2010 and 2011 Victorian floods. During these events, the Wimmera reached 3.32 m and 4.71 m respectively. The 2011 event was particularly severe with the Wimmera River reaching a record peak; over 1,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters divided the city and damaged 600 houses pushing up to a metre of water into parts of the CBD.\n\nThe Victorian government has recognised the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagik nations as the traditional owners for the Horsham area. These five nations are represented by the Barengi Gadjin Land Council Aboriginal Corporation.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 16,250 people in Horsham.\n\nThe city of Horsham is situated on the floodplain of the Wimmera River, south of the Dooen Swamp and north of the River's junction with McKenzie Creek. The Wimmera River rises in the western slopes of the Pyrenees and then runs west towards Horsham before turning north at Quantong and heading north towards the Murray, but empties into Lake Hindmarsh. The Wimmera River is damned by a weir at the southern edge of the city. A recent study in December 2017, found that the Millennium drought decimated the Platypus population in the River leaving only a solitary colony south of the weir.\n\nHorsham is classified as a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) similar to Mildura although with less rain and drier for more of the year. As such, although its latitude makes it on average a degree cooler than Mildura, it can receive relatively more extremes of temperature.\n\nHorsham's topography is flat, approximately above sea level. The central business district (CBD) is laid out in a grid plan south of the train line and is characterised by wide streets and several roundabouts. Firebrace Street, running north–south through the middle of the CBD is one of Horham's original \"thoroughfares\" (first surveyed in 1849) and is named after a soldier from the British Army, Major William Firebrace. Residential areas extend north of the train line, west towards Natimuk and south-west towards Haven and south-east across Burnt Creek. A light industrial area is located south of the Wimmera River. \n\nDue to the flat topography and floodplain clay, there are very few multi-story buildings. The five most prominent buildings in the city are the State Government Offices on McLauchlin Street, the T&G clocktower on Firebrace Street, St John Anglican church on the Western Highway, the Horsham Cinema and Horsham Town Hall, both on Pynsent Street.\n\nDue to Horsham's location in the Murray Basin, the area to the east and south of the city contain extensive deposits of Mineral Sands, primarily ilmenite, zircon and rutile. Preliminary exploration was conducted in the 1980s at Drung, a locality east of Horsham. However, the Conservation Council of Australia opposed the exploration citing the long-term consequences of mining activity and the possibility of inadequate rehabilitation.\n\nIn June 2018 new mining exploration leases for the Wimmera region were granted by the Victorian State Government.\n\nIn 1993 the Kennett Government passed the \"Local Government (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill\" which resulted in council amalgamations across Victoria.

It is operated by the Horsham Rural City Council also contains the Horsham Regional Art Gallery. The Wesley Performing Arts Centre, once the Wesley Church, was, until 2018, a second performance venue. However, it was closed indefinitely in June 2018 due to safety concerns. The Horsham Arts Council, formed in 1972 and based in Old Hamilton Road, regularly stages musicals. Horsham also hosts the annual Art is...festival, some aspects of the biennial Nati Frinj Festival and Awakenings (Australia's only regional disability arts festival).\n\nHorsham has community bands such as the Horsham City Brass Band and the Horsham Pipe Band with many towns surrounding the city having their own community bands.

The original buildings of the College became the Horsham High School in 1912, however, the High School was moved to a new site on Dimboola Road in 1926. Public primary school education was conducted at the Central School until 1955 when another primary campus was added in the west. A third primary school was added in 1965 in the north. A Roman Catholic primary school was established in 1883 and a Lutheran primary school was established in 1978.

He is the author of Targum Jonathan, and a book of kabbalah known as \"Sefer Migdanim\" has been attributed to him.\n\nJonathan ben Uzziel is mentioned several times in the Talmud. Jonathan rendered an Aramaic translation of the Major and Minor Prophets which still survives today. When he wished to procure a translation of the Hagiography, a Divine voice (Hebrew: \"bat ḳol\") was heard telling him that what he had done was sufficient for humanity.\n\nThe Rabbis have taught: Hillel the Elder had eighty disciples; thirty of whom were worthy that the Divine Presence (\"Shekhina\") rest upon them, like Moses our Master; thirty of whom were worthy that the sun stand still for them, like Joshua, the son of Nun; twenty of whom were average. The greatest of them all was Jonathan ben Uzziel; the least of them all was Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai. […] They said about Jonathan ben Uzziel that, in the hour that he would sit and study Torah, any bird flying over him would straightaway be incinerated.\n\nAccording to tradition, the tomb of ben Uzziel is located in Amuka, Galilee near Safed, Israel.\n\nAccording to Zev Vilnai, Rabbi Shmuel ben Shimshon wrote about the tomb in 1210: \"There is a large tree next to it, and the Ishmaelites [Arabs] bring oil and light a candle in his honor and make vows in his honor.\" An illustration of Yonatan ben Uzziel's tomb appears in \"Ancestry of fathers and prophets\" (Hebrew: יחוס אבות ונביאים), a book printed in 1537.\n\nIt is customary to visit ben Uzziel's tomb on Rosh Chodesh, the first day of the lunar month, and on 26 Sivan (the day on which he died), although visitors arrive all year round. A practice that began in the 17th century was to pray at the gravesite for a good marriage partner, for children, satisfaction from one's children, a good livelihood, health and happiness. Many unmarried men and women pray there for a match. Doing so is considered a \"segula\" (propitious remedy) for finding one's mate within the coming year.\n\nZev Vilnai offers two theories for this custom: (a) The practice developed from the Pseudo-Jonathan translation of the Bible on Deuteronomy 24:6, where he writes that anyone who prevents the connection between a husband and wife forfeits his portion in the world-to-come; (b) The practice is based on a mistaken reading of Rashi who writes in reference to a place called Harpania (Aramaic:הרפניא) \"Everyone goes there: all ineligible men (\"pesulim\") who cannot find a woman turn and go there. And it is deeper (\"Amuka\") and worse than Gehinnom.\" The words \"and it is deeper (\"Amuka\")\" are the headwords to Rashi's next comment, and do not relate to his preceding comment about men going to Harpania to look for women. However, the mistaken reading connects Rashi's words to the community named Amuka.\n\nIt is also widely believed that Jonathan ben Uzziel was single or childless, so men in similar situations seek to benefit from his special powers, but nowhere in the writings of Chazal is this stated.\n\n"}

{"id": "1966544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966544", "title": "Dorothy Arzner", "text": "Dorothy Arzner\n\nDorothy Emma Arzner (January 3, 1897 – October 1, 1979) was an American film director whose career in Hollywood spanned from the silent era of the 1920s into the early 1940s. From 1927 until her retirement from feature directing in 1943, Arzner was the only female director working in Hollywood. Additionally, she was one of a very few women able to establish a successful and long career in Hollywood as a film director until the 1970s. Arzner made a total of twenty films between 1927 and 1943 and launched the careers of a number of Hollywood actresses, including Katharine Hepburn, Rosalind Russell, and Lucille Ball. Additionally, Arzner was the first woman to join the Directors Guild of America and the first woman to direct a sound film.\n\nArzner was born in San Francisco, California, in 1897 to Jenetter (née Young) and Louis Arzner but grew up in Los Angeles, where her father owned a restaurant. Her parents' restaurant was the first place Arzner came into contact with Hollywood elite; it was frequented by many silent film stars and directors, including Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett, and Douglas Fairbanks. After finishing high school at the Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles, she enrolled at the University of Southern California, where she spent two years studying medicine with hopes of becoming a doctor. During World War I she joined a local Southern California ambulance unit. After spending a summer working in the office of a respected surgeon however, Arzner decided that she did not want a career in medicine. \"I wanted to be like Jesus,\" she said. \"'Heal the sick and raise the dead,' instantly, without surgery, pills, et cetera.\"\n\nAfter World War I the film industry was in need of workers. According to Arzner herself this was her opportunity to get a foot in the door. \"It was possible for even inexperienced people to have an opportunity if they showed signs of ability or knowledge\" she said in a 1974 interview published in \"Cinema\". A girl friend from college suggested Arzner meet with William DeMille, a major director for Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, the parent company of Paramount. Arzner told the Sunday Star in 1929 that the friend thought she would be well suited to the industry. \"Then she drove me over to the Paramount studio and dumped me out in front of the main office\" she said.\n\nWhen Arzner met with DeMille in 1919, he asked her in which department she would like to start. \"I might be able to dress sets,\" Arzner replied. After asking her a question about the furniture in his office that she did not know the answer to, DeMille suggested Arzner explore the different departments for a week and talk to his secretary. Arzner spent the week watching the sets at work, including that of Cecil DeMille, after which she made the observation \"If one was going to be in this movie business, one should be a director because he was the one who told everyone else what to do.\"\n\nAt the recommendation of DeMille's secretary Arzner decided to start in the script department, typing scripts so she could learn \"what the film was to be all about.\" Within six months Arzner became an editor at the subsidiary of Paramount, Realart Studio, where she edited 52 films. In 1922, she was recalled to Paramount proper to edit the Rudolph Valentino film \"Blood and Sand\" (1922). This proved to be Arzner's opportunity to try her hand at directing. Although she went uncredited, Arzner shot some of the bull-fighting scenes for the film and edited this footage, intercutting it with stock footage, thereby saving Paramount thousands of dollars. Arzner's work on \"Blood and Sand\" caught the attention of director James Cruze who would later employ her as a writer and editor for a number of his films. According to Arzner, Cruze told people she was \"his right arm.\" She eventually wrote the shooting script and edited Cruze's \"Old Ironsides\" (1926).\n\nThrough her work with Cruze, Arzner gained considerable leverage and threatened to leave Paramount for Columbia if she was not given a picture to direct. \"I had an offer to write and direct a film for Columbia,\" Arzner said, \"It was then I closed out my salary at Paramount and was about to leave for Columbia.\" Before leaving, Arzner decided to say goodbye to \"someone important and not just leave unnoticed and forgotten\" which led her to Walter Wanger, the head of Paramount's New York studio. When she said she was leaving Wanger offered Arzner a job in the scenario department and a discussion about directing sometime in the future. Arzner replied \"Not unless I can be on a set in two weeks with an A picture. I'd rather do a picture for a small company and have my own way than a B picture for Paramount.\" Wanger then offered her a chance to direct a comedy based on the play \"The Best Dressed Woman in Paris\", which would later be titled \"Fashions for Women\" (1927), Arzner's first picture.\n\nPrior to \"Fashions for Women\", Arzner had not directed a thing. \"In fact I hadn't told anyone to do anything before,\" she said. The film starred Esther Ralston and was a commercial success. Arzner's success led Paramount to hire her as director for three more silent films, \"Ten Modern Commandments\" (1927), \"Get Your Man\" (1927), and \"Manhattan Cocktail\" (1928), after which she was entrusted to direct the studio's first talking picture, \"The Wild Party\" (1929) a remake of a silent film which Arzner herself had edited.\n\n\"The Wild Party\" starred Clara Bow in her first talking picture, and Fredric March, in his first leading role. To compensate for Bow's awkwardness around not being able to move freely due to the cumbersome sound equipment, Arzner had a rig made in which a microphone was attached to the end of a fishing rod allowing Bow to move around; this was the first boom mic. The film about a college girl, played by Bow, who leads a party lifestyle and falls for one of her professors, March, was a huge commercial and critical success. \"The Wild Party\" was such a success that it kicked off a series of films \"set on college campuses where the fun-loving, hard-drinking students include coeds who fall in love with their professors.\"\n\nAfter \"The Wild Party\", Arzner directed eleven more features for Paramount, including \"Sarah and Son\" (1930) starring Ruth Chatterton and \"Honor Among Lovers\" (1931) starring Claudette Colbert, though after 1932 she left the studio to work on a freelance basis. During her time freelancing, Arzner made some of her best-known films, \"Christopher Strong\" (1933) with Katharine Hepburn, \"Craig's Wife\" (1936) starring Rosalind Russell, and \"Dance, Girl, Dance\" (1940) featuring Lucille Ball.\n\n\"Christopher Strong\" follows a female aviator named Cynthia Darrington, played by Katharine Hepburn, who begins an affair with a married man, Christopher Strong. Towards the end of the film, Strong's wife Elaine appears to both acknowledge and forgive Cynthia for the affair. This is an example of the way Arzner turned conventional societal views of women upside-down. Instead of pitting the two women against each other, buying into the narrative of women as rivals, Arzner complicates and interrogates typical views of women by portraying a genuine moment of connection between Cynthia and Elaine. In an article for \"Jumpcut,\" Jane Gaines argues that a reading of \"Christopher Strong\" could allude to Arzner's belief that \"heterosexual monogamy cripples the imagination and curbs the appetite for living.\" Arzner herself noted that the film was well-liked at the time but that she never considered it her favorite. \"I could hardly consider any one a favorite,\" she said. \"I always saw too many flaws.\"\n\n\"Craig's Wife\" tells the story of Harriet Craig, played by Rosalind Russell, a woman so consumed by the upkeep of her home that nothing else interests her. The film was based on a stage play of the same name by George Kelley but differed in its treatment of its female protagonist. The play, in a much more misogynistic look at the American housewife, sided with Harriet's husband, portraying her as cold and disinterested. Arzner's version turned the story into \"a plea for women to become their own people rather than beautiful possessions.\" In her essay entitled \"The Woman at the Keyhole: Women's Cinema and Feminist Criticism,\" Judith Mayne writes that \"it is Harriet's husband who married for love, not money\" whereas Harriet approached the marriage as \"a business contract.\" In this way, \"Craig's Wife\" is an example of a running theme in Arzner's work: the repressiveness of heterosexual marriage. Mayer writes that Arzner's films \"show again and again that when a man believes he can own a woman and women have to compete for men, then romance, loyalty and friendship go out the window.\" In \"Craig's Wife\", Arzner offers the possibility of women's community after the instability of heterosexual romance with the final scene between Harriet and widowed next door neighbor. Both women have been left by their husbands, in vastly different ways, and their next potentially meaningful connection is with each other.\n\n\"Dance, Girl, Dance\" is one of Arzner's most celebrated films. Described by Variety as \"an unlikely-female-buddy burlesque movie that conceals a withering attack on the male gaze under its showgirl wardrobe of sequins and feathers,\" the film starred Lucille Ball and Maureen O'Hara as the pair of showgirl best friends. \"Dance, Girl, Dance\" is yet another example of the ways in which Arzner subverted and complicated traditional depictions of women and female relationships. The film is Arzner's best-known and most-studied work and thematizes the issues of female performance, female relationships, and social mobility. Most notable though, is the film's interrogation of the male gaze. \"Dance, Girl, Dance\" \"foregrounds dance as women's avenue to self-expression and economic independence.\" In a scene towards the latter half of the film, O'Hara's character Judy stops her stage performance to directly address the diegetic male audience. Judy confronts the men with a stirring admonishment of their objectification of women. In feminist film studies, this scene has been read as a \"returning\" of the male gaze and a larger address to the real life, not just diegetic, audience.\n\nIn 1943, after making \"First Comes Courage\" (1943), Arzner retired from Hollywood. Though it is not known why she did so, it is speculated that Arzner's retirement was due to a decline in critical reception and commercial success of her films. It could also have been due to the increasing of systemic sexism and homophobia after the implementation of the Hayes Code. Despite leaving Hollywood, Arzner continued to work in the field of film. She made Women's Army Corps training films during World War II.\n\nIn 1950 Arzner became associated with the Pasadena Playhouse, a well known theatre company in southern California, where she founded filmmaking classes. She produced some theatre plays and starred a radio program called \"You wanna be a star.\" In 1952 she joined the staff of the College of the Arts of the Playhouse as the head of the Cinema and Television Department. She taught the first year of cinema in the university. In the late fifties she became the entertainment and publicity consultant at the Pepsi company, with the influence of the boss's wife, Joan Crawford, with whom Arzner had a close relationship. Arzner made a series of successful commercials for Pepsi, most of them with Crawford.\n\nIn 1961 Arzner joined the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, in the Motion Picture division as a staff member, where she spent four years supervising advanced cinema classes before retiring in June 1965. There she taught Francis Ford Coppola. and became an evident reference for him in the future. Arzner's documents, files and films are preserved in Cinema and Television File in UCLA, thanks to Jodie Foster, who raised sufficient funds for their maintenance.\n\nDorothy Arzner was born in San Francisco, California on January 3, 1897, but moved with her parents Louis and Jenetter Arzner to Los Angeles, where her father opened a very prestigious restaurant next to a theatre in Hollywood. Arzner spent her childhood surrounded by celebrities who came to the restaurant, including Maude Adams, Sarah Bernhardt and David Warfield, among others, but she was so used to them that she was never attracted to the cinema world.\n\nEven though she started her medical degree at the University of Southern California, in a 1974 interview with Karin Kay and Gerald Peary published in \"Cinema\", Arzner said \"With a few summer months in the office of a fine surgeon and meeting with the sick, I decided that was not what I wanted. I wanted to be like Jesus – 'Heal the sick and raise the dead', instantly, without surgery, pills, et cetera.\" It was then, two years into her degree, that she left and decided to find a job so she could acquire economic independence. Arzner, in spite of having abandoned the degree, had a broad education, which included architecture and art history courses. As soon as she left the university she began working for Paramount Studios doing jobs such as that of a cutter or editor, for which she would be specifically recognized in \"Blood and Sand (1922)\". Later, the studios would offer her a two-year contract as a director, but it was not until the contract was finished that she would start a freelance career.\n\nArzner would maintain a forty-year relationship with Marion Morgan, a dancer and choreographer who was ten years older than Arzner. Even though she tried to keep her private life as private as possible, Arzner had been linked romantically with a number of actresses, including Alla Nazimova and Billie Burke. It was rumored, though never confirmed, that Arzner also had relationships with Joan Crawford and Katharine Hepburn. She never hid her sexual orientation, nor her identity; her clothing was unconventional for a woman of that time, she wore suits or straight dresses. Morgan choreographed some dancing sequences in some of Arzner's movies, such as \"Dance, Girl, Dance\".\n\nIn 1930, Arzner and Morgan moved to Mountain Oak Drive, where they lived until Morgan's death in 1971. While they lived in Hollywood, Arzner assisted various cinematographic events. In her last years Arzner left Hollywood and went to live in the desert. In 1979, at the age of 82, Arzner died in La Quinta, California.\n\nArzner's work, both as a female filmmaker and a lesbian filmmaker, has been an important area of film studies. Perhaps due to Arzner's leaving Hollywood in the 1940s, her work had been all but forgotten until the 1970s when she was rediscovered by feminist film theorists. Since then Arzner's films have been studied for their depictions of gender and female sexuality.\n\nFor her achievements in the field of motion pictures, Arzner was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street, the only award she received.\n\nIn 1972 the First International Festival of Women's Films honored her by screening \"The Wild Party\", and her oeuvre was given a full retrospective at the Second Festival in 1976. In 1975 the Director's Guild of America honored her with \"A Tribute to Dorothy Arzner.\" During the tribute, a telegram from Katharine Hepburn was read: \"Isn't it wonderful that you've had such a great career, when you had no right to have a career at all?\"\n\nIn March 2018, Paramount dedicated its Dressing Room building to Arzner.\n\nR.M. Vaughan's 2000 play, \"Camera, Woman\" depicts the last day of Arzner's career. In the play, Harry Cohn fires her over a kissing scene between Merle Oberon and fictitious actor Rose Lindstrom—the name of a character played by Isobel Elsom in Arzner's last film, \"First Comes Courage\", in which Oberon starred—in a never-completed final film. The play also depicts Arzner and Oberon as lovers. It is told in a prologue, four acts, and an epilogue in the form of a post-show interview that contains actual quotations from Arzner.\n\nS. Louisa Wei's 2014 feature documentary, \"Golden Gate Girls\", compares the media representation of Arzner with that of Esther Eng, Hong Kong's first woman director who was a Chinese American. Judith Mayne, the author of \"Directed by Dorothy Arzner\", is interviewed in the documentary, saying, \"I love the fact that history of woman filmmakers now would include Dorothy Arzner and Esther Eng as the two of the real exceptions, who proved it was entirely possible to build a successful film career without necessarily being a part of mainstream identity.\"\n\n\nCasella, Donna R. \"What Women Want: The Complex World of Dorothy Arzner and Her Cinematic Women.\" Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media, =50 no. 1/2, 2009, 235-270, Jstor.org\n\n\"Dorothy Arzner\".

{"id": "1966560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966560", "title": "2001 (Dr. Dre album)", "text": "2001 (Dr. Dre album)\n\n2001 is the second studio album by rapper and hip hop producer Dr. Dre. It was released on November 16, 1999, by Aftermath Entertainment as the follow-up to his 1992 debut album \"The Chronic\". The album was produced mainly by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, as well as Lord Finesse, and features several guest contributions from fellow American rappers such as The D.O.C., Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, Eminem, and Nate Dogg. \"2001\" exhibits an expansion on Dre's debut G-funk sound and contains gangsta rap themes such as violence, promiscuity, drug use, street gangs, sex and crime.\n\nThe album debuted at number 2 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 516,000 copies in its first week. It produced 3 singles that attained chart success and has been certified 6× Platinum by the RIAA; as of August 2015 the album has sold 7,800,000 copies in the United States. \"2001\" received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the music although some found the lyrics objectionable.\n\nThe album was initially titled \"Chronic 2000\" until Priority Records, who had become Death Row Records' new distributor decided in cohesiveness with Death Row's founder and then-CEO Suge Knight to call their compilation album \"Chronic 2000\". Death Row owned the trademark for \"The Chronic\" as did Interscope Records who previously distributed Death Row. Knight was tipped off about the name of Dr. Dre's album since notification of the trademark use was required by his label Aftermath Records. When Aftermath found out that Priority and Death Row planned to use the same name for their album, Dre sought legal action. According to his lawyer Howard King, \"both sides agreed that we'd allow the other to use the title, and then let the public decide which one they preferred\".\n\nAfter the release of \"Chronic 2000\", they announced that Dr. Dre's album would now be named \"Chronic 2001\". Shortly after, Interscope began a big budget promotional campaign for \"Chronic 2001\". At this point, Priority decided not to honor the original agreement and threatened to sue Dre if the \"Chronic\" trademark were to be used in any capacity. Dre eventually decided to release the album as simply \"2001\".\n\nIn an interview with \"The New York Times\", Dr. Dre spoke about his motivation to record the album and how he felt that he had to prove himself to fans and media again after doubts arose over his production and rapping ability. These doubts came from the fact that he had not released a solo studio album since \"The Chronic\" (1992). He stated:\n\nThe album was intended to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, \"Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs.\" Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented \"I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously.\"\n\nSome of the lyrics on the album used by Dre have been noted to be penned by several ghostwriters. Royce da 5'9\" was rumored to be a ghostwriter on the album. He was noted for writing the last track, \"The Message\"; however, he is not credited by his legal name or alias in the liner notes. A track he recorded on the album, originally named \"The Way I Be Pimpin'\", was later retouched as \"Xxplosive\"; this version has Dr. Dre rapping penned verses by Royce and featured Royce's vocals on the chorus. Royce wrote several tracks such as \"The Throne Is Mine\" and \"Stay in Your Place\" which were later cut from the final track list. The tracks have been leaked later on several mixtapes, including \"Pretox\".\n\nThe album's production expanded on that of \"The Chronic\", with new, sparse beats and reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: \"At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine.\" Josh Tyrangiel of \"Time\" has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating \"Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound.\"\n\nThe album primarily featured co-production between Dr. Dre and Mel-Man and was generally well received by critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that Dr. Dre had expanded on the G-funk beats on his previous album, \"The Chronic\", and stated, \"He's pushed himself hard, finding new variations in the formula by adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae, resulting in fairly interesting recontextualizations\" and went on to say, \"Sonically, this is first-rate, straight-up gangsta.\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\"s Tom Sinclair depicted the album as \"Chilly keyboard motifs gliding across gut-punching bass lines, strings and synths swooping in and out of the mix, naggingly familiar guitar licks providing visceral punctuation\". \"NME\" described the production as \"patented tectonic funk beats and mournful atmospherics\". \"PopMatters\" praised the production, stating that \"the hip-hop rhythms are catchy, sometimes in your face, sometimes subtle, but always a fine backdrop for the power of Dre's voice.\" Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" mentioned that the beats were \"lean and immaculate, each one a pithy combination of beat, rap, melody and strategic silences\".\n\nThe album marked the beginning of Dr. Dre's collaboration with keyboardist Scott Storch, who had previously worked with The Roots and is credited as a co-writer on several of \"2001\"s tracks, including the hit single \"Still D.R.E.\". Storch would later go on to become a successful producer in his own right, and has been credited as a co-producer with Dr. Dre on some of his productions since.\n\nThe lyrics on the album received criticism and created some controversy. They include many themes associated with gangsta rap, such as violence, promiscuity, street gangs, drive-by shootings, crime and drug usage. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the only subject matter on the album was \"violence, drugs, pussy, bitches, dope, guns, and gangsters\" and that these themes have become repetitive and unchanged in the last ten years. Critics noted that Dr. Dre had differed from his effort to \"clean-up his act\" which he tried to establish with his 1996 single, \"Been There, Done That\" from \"Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath\".\n\n\"NME\" mentioned that the album was full of \"pig-headed, punk-dicked, 'bitch'-dissing along with requisite dollops of ho-slapping violence, marijuana-addled bravado and penis-sucking wish fulfilment.\" Massey noted that the lyrics were overly explicit but praised his delivery and flow: \"His rhymes are quick, his delivery laid back yet full of punch.\" The rhymes involve Dr. Dre's return to the forefront of hip hop, which is conveyed in the singles \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"Forgot About Dre\". Many critics cited the last track, \"The Message\"; a song dedicated to Dr. Dre's deceased brother, as what the album could have been without the excessively explicit lyrics, with Massey calling it \"downright beautiful\" and \"a classic of modern rap\".\n\nThree singles were released from the album: \"Still D.R.E.\", \"Forgot About Dre\" and \"The Next Episode\". Other tracks \"Fuck You\", \"Let's Get High\", \"What's the Difference\" and \"Xxplosive\" were not officially released as singles but received some radio airplay which resulted in them charting in the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. \"Still D.R.E.\" was released as the lead single in October 1999. It peaked at number 93 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 32 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and reached number 11 on the Hot Rap Singles. It reached number six on the UK single charts in March 2000. The song was nominated at the 2000 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, but lost to The Roots and Erykah Badu's \"You Got Me\".\n\n\"Forgot About Dre\" was released as the second single in 2000 and like the previous single, it was a hit on multiple charts. It reached number 25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 14 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number 3 on the Rhythmic Top 40. It reached number seven on the UK single charts in June 2000. The accompanying music video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video in 2000. The song won Dr. Dre and Eminem Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 2001 Grammy Awards.\n\n\"The Next Episode\" was released as the third and final single in 2000. It peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number 2 on the Rhythmic Top 40. It peaked at number three on UK single charts in February 2001. It was nominated at the 2001 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, but the award went to another single from the same album to Dr. Dre and Eminem for \"Forgot About Dre\".\n\nThe album debuted at number 2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, with first-week sales of 516,000 copies. It also entered at number one on \"Billboard\"s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was successful in Canada, where it reached number 2 on the charts. The record was mildly successful in Europe, reaching number 4 in the United Kingdom, number 7 in Ireland, number 15 in France, number 17 in the Netherlands and number 26 in Norway. It peaked at number 11 on the New Zealand album chart. Closing out the year of 2000, the album was number 5 on the \"Billboard\" Top Albums and number one on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It re-entered the charts in 2003, peaking on the UK Albums Top 75 at number 61 and on the Ireland Albums Top 75 at number 30. The album was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 21, 2000. It is Dr. Dre's best selling album, as his previous album, \"The Chronic\", was certified three times platinum. As of August 2015, the album has sold 7,800,000 copies in the United States.\n\n\"2001\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated, \"\"2001\" isn't as consistent or striking as \"Slim Shady\", but the music is always brimming with character.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Tom Sinclair praised the production, calling it \"uncharacteristically sparse sound\" from Dr. Dre and that it was as \"addictive as it was back when over 3 million record buyers got hooked on \"The Chronic\" and Snoop Dogg's Dre-produced \"Doggystyle\"\" and went on to commend Dr. Dre, stating, \"If any rap producer deserves the title \"composer\", it's he.\" \"NME\" mentioned that Dr. Dre didn't expand the genre, but it was \"powerful enough in parts, but not clever enough to give Will Smith the fear\". PopMatters writer Chris Massey declared that \"Musically, \"2001\" is about as close to brilliant as any one gangsta rap album might possibly get.\" Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" stated that \"The beats are fresh and involving, and Dre's collaborations with Eminem and Snoop Dogg have ferocity and wit.\" Although he was ambivalent towards the album's subject matter and guest rappers, Greg Tate of \"Spin\" was pleasantly surprised by \"the most memorable MC'ing on this album com[ing] from Dre himself, Eminem notwithstanding\" and stated, \"Whatever one's opinion of the sexual politics and gun lust of Dre's canon, his ongoing commitment to formal excellence and sonic innovation in this art form may one day earn him a place next to George Clinton, if not Stevie Wonder, Duke Ellington, or Miles Davis.\"\n\nIn a negative review, Robert Christgau from \"The Village Voice\" found Dr. Dre's lyrics distastefully misogynistic, writing \"it's a New Millennium, but he's Still S.L.I.M.E. ... For an hour, with time out for some memorable Eminem tracks, Dre degrades women every way he can think of, all of which involve his dick.\" \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Greg Kot said Dr. Dre's production boasted unique elements but \"the endless gangsta babble, with its casual misogyny and flippant violence,\" sounded flagrantly trite. AllMusic's Erlewine spoke of how the number of guest rappers affected the album, and questioned his reasons for collaborating with \"pedestrian rappers\". He claimed that \"the album suffers considerably as a result [of these collaborations]\". Erlewine criticized the lyrics, which he said were repetitive and full of \"gangsta clichés\". Sinclair mentioned similar views of the lyrics, calling them \"filthy\", but noted \"none of [this] should diminish Dre's achievement\". \"NME\" spoke of how the lyrics were too explicit, stating, \"As the graphic grooves stretch out, littered with gunfire, bombings and 'copters over Compton, and the bitch-beating baton is handed from Knock-Turnal to Kurupt, \"2001\" reaches gangsta-rap parody-level with too many tracks coming off like porno-Wu outtakes.\" Massey referred to the lyrics as a \"caricature of an ethos [rather] than a reflection of any true prevailing beliefs.\"\n\nIn 2006, \"Hip Hop Connection\" ranked \"2001\" number 10 on its list of the 100 Best Albums (1995–2005) in hip hop.

Chlorophyll contained in vegetation absorbs most of the light in the visible part of the spectrum but becomes almost transparent at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. The cellular structure of the vegetation then causes this infrared light to be reflected because each cell acts something like an elementary corner reflector. The change can be from 5% to 50% reflectance going from 680 nm to 730 nm. This is an advantage to plants in avoiding overheating during photosynthesis. For a more detailed explanation and a graph of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region, see Normalized difference vegetation index#Rationale.\n\nThe phenomenon accounts for the brightness of foliage in infrared photography and is extensively utilized in the form of so-called vegetation indices (e.g. Normalized difference vegetation index). It is used in remote sensing to monitor plant activity, and it has been suggested that it could be useful to detect light-harvesting organisms on distant planets.\n\n"}

At the 2016 census, Maryborough had a population of 7,921.\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by the Dja Dja Wurrung people. The first Europeans to settle were the Simson brothers, who established a sheep station, known as Charlotte Plains, in 1840. Gold was discovered at White Hill, 4 kilometres north of Maryborough, in 1854, leading to prospectors rushing to the area. At its peak Maryborough is reported to have had a population of up to 50,000 although local historian Betty Osborn, of Maryborough-Midlands Historical Society inc., says it was closer to 30,000.\n\nThe town site was surveyed in 1854, with a police camp, Methodist church, and hospital amongst the first infrastructure. The Post Office opened on 19 October 1854.\n\nThe settlement was originally known as Simsons, but later changed to Maryborough by the gold commissioner James Daly, after his Irish birthplace. One of Victoria's earliest newspapers, \"The Maryborough Advertiser\", was established in 1854. Land sales commenced in 1856, and Maryborough became the administrative and commercial centre of the area. The town became a borough in 1857.\n\nThe last gold mine in Maryborough closed in 1918. In 1924 the Maryborough Knitting Mills opened, which established the town as a centre for the wool industry. Maryborough became a city in 1961.\n\nMaryborough enjoys a temperate climate with four distinct seasons and is typically dry and mild. The mean minimum January temperature with the maximum a balmy , however temperatures above are commonly recorded during the summer months. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 7 February 2009.\nThe mean minimum temperature in July is , with and average maximum of . The lowest ever recorded minimum in the city was on 21 July 1982. Although the city experiences little snow due to its low elevation, frosts are common during the colder winter months.\n\nThe city averages rainfall annually, with a slightly more rainfall falling in the second half of the year, generally only experienced in short bursts of showers, rather than extended periods of rainfall. The dryness of the area, due to poor topographical features places significant pressure on water reserves. Maryborough ended of one of the longest droughts on record during the 2010/2011 summer when it experience some of the highest rainfall on recorded which caused flooding throughout the local area. The city is currently on permanent water restrictions.\n\nMaryborough has been threatened by bushfires on multiple occasions, most notably in January 1985 when a large fire devastated the surrounding area resulting in 3 deaths and 180 homes lost.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, there are 7,921 people that reside in Maryborough. Like many regional centres, a high percentage of the population (83.1%) were born in Australia, with England (3.2%), New Zealand (0.7%) and Netherlands (0.5%) notable countries of birth outside Australia.\n\nTechnicians, trade workers and labourers (34.4%) make up the bulk of the workforce with Professionals, Sales Workers and Managers contributing to large portions of the city's employment base.\n\nJust over 19% of the population describe themselves as Anglican, with 33.6% of the population claiming no religious affiliation. Catholics, Presbyterians, Salvation Army and Baptists also contribute to the Christian majority of the population.\n\nMaryborough has three schools:\n\nThe town hosts a market on the first Sunday of each month, a Highland Gathering on New Year's Day (which has been held since 1857), the Golden Wattle Festival in August or September and the Australasian Goldpanning Championships in October or November.\n\nMaryborough also plays host to the RACV Energy Breakthrough in which thousands of students, teachers, parents and spectators from around Australia come to the town to witness a Human Powered Vehicle race where teams can complete up to in 24 hours.\n\nMaryborough has a number of community bands including the Maryborough City Brass Band, the Maryborough Big Band, the Maryborough and District Pipe Band and the well-known Maryborough Traditional Jazz Ensemble.\n\n\"The Maryborough Advertiser\" is the local newspaper in the Central Goldfields region. The Maryborough Advertiser circulates to over 4000 homes throughout the region. The 'Addy' as it's known locally, employs 13 local people. It is published every Tuesday and Friday. In 2015–2016 the Maryborough and District Advertiser celebrated 160 years as the printed voice of the local community.\n\nIn early February 2007 transmission of \"Goldfields FM 99.1\" commenced.\n\nMaryborough receives all the major free-to-air television stations (ABC, Prime7, WIN, SC10 and SBS), as well as all new digital channels (ABC2, ABC3, ABC News 24, SBS2, One HD, GO!, 7Two, eleven, 7Mate and gem). Prime7 and WIN are simply the regional affiliates of Channels Seven and Nine, and re-broadcast their network signals. There are slight differences however, as both Prime7 and WIN broadcast their own local news bulletins from the Bendigo or Ballarat stations. Both stations also make sure to watermark everything that airs with their own logos — at a larger scale than the Seven and Nine logos. The pay television service Austar is also available to the residents of Maryborough.\n\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the major Bendigo Football League and another two other teams, Maryborough Rovers and Royal Park, competing in the minor Maryborough Castlemaine District Football League.\n\nMaryborough has a soccer club with local teams competing in Under 9, Under 13, and Under 17 competitions, and a senior team that competes in the Ballarat & District Soccer Association. There are also both social and competitive Futsal competitions held throughout the year.\n\nMaryborough Harness Racing Club conducts regular meetings at its racetrack located at nearby Carisbrook.\n\nGolfers play at the course of the Maryborough Golf Club on Park Road.\n\nThere are three cricket clubs in Maryborough. The Colts Phelans Cricket Club, the M.K.M. Cricket Club, and the Maryborough Cricket all compete in the Maryborough District Cricket Association.\n\nMaryborough, after years of having a strong competition in grass hockey, folded in 2013, leaving them with only the one team competing in the B women level in the Hockey Central Vic in Bendigo. Maryborough were premiers 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn basketball, the Maryborough Blazers compete in the Country Basketball League North East league, with a team in both the men's and women's competitions.

In 2007 the station underwent a $1.2 million upgrade to conduct vital repairs to the historic bell tower, clock and roof which was built in 1890.\n\nIn 1895 American writer Mark Twain visited the town and remarked about the station upon his visit.\n\nDon't you overlook that Maryborough station, if you take an interest in governmental curiosities. Why, you can put the whole population of Maryborough into it, and give them a sofa apiece, and have room for more. You haven't fifteen stations in America that are as big, and you probably haven't five that are half as fine. Why, it's perfectly elegant. And the clock! Everybody will show you the clock. There isn't a station in Europe that's got such a clock. It doesn't strike—and that's one mercy. It hasn't any bell; and as you'll have cause to remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia is simply bedamned with bells.\"\n\nDaily train services to and from Ballarat, with onward connections to Melbourne's Southern Cross station commenced in 2010.\n\nThe Avoca railway line is to be reopened (as of 2017) ultimately to connect Mildura with Portland with standard gauge track.\n\nThe city also has coach and bus services that connect to various parts of the city with connections to Melbourne and other parts of Victoria.\n\nThe local library was fitted with a 30 kW solar system in late 2012.\n\n\n"}

Upon the journalist commenting that he seemed unexcited, Lincoln replied: \"young man, I have lived for seventy-five years and I have learned to take things as they come\". He did however seem disappointed to hear there was little else to inherit apart from the peerage itself.\n\nThe Australian press was much more excited by the news, and three camera crews appeared outside the new peer's flat at Elanora Villas, Bunbury, Western Australia, before more reporters arrived by helicopter. Soon after inheriting the Earldom, the new Lord Lincoln travelled to England, where he was warmly received by (among others) leading citizens of the City of Lincoln. The story was soon fictionalized as a storyline in the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\".\n\nHe later wrote an autobiography called \"Memoirs of an Embryo Earl\", published in 1992, and set about putting on record his formal right to the peerage with a view to taking his seat in the House of Lords. After being briefed on the workings of the Upper House by Lord Deedes, and having been received at the College of Arms, Lincoln stated his intention of joining the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. However, there were delays in the process of claiming his seat, which was defeated by the reforms of the upper house in the House of Lords Act 1999. Lincoln thereafter had no automatic right to sit in the Lords, as all but 92 hereditary peers had been removed. His grandson, the 19th Earl, was later courted by New Labour.\n\nLord Lincoln died in Western Australia on 7 July 2001.\n\nIn 1940, Fiennes-Clinton married Leila Ruth Fitzpatrick, \"née\" Millen, and they had two children, Patricia Ruth Fiennes-Clinton (born 1 February 1941, \"now\" Lady Patricia Elrick), and Edward Gordon Fiennes-Clinton (1943–99; styled \"Lord Fynes\", by courtesy).\n\nAfter his first wife died on 19 July 1947, Fiennes-Clinton on 3 December 1953 married Linda Alice, daughter of Rev Charles Creed and widow of James Anthony O'Brien; they had no children.\n\nWhen his 10th cousin, the 10th and last Duke of Newcastle, died on Christmas Day 1988, Fiennes-Clinton succeeded to His Grace's subsidiary title of Earl of Lincoln.\nHis ancestor, Sir Henry Clinton, of Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, was the 2nd Earl of Lincoln's elder son by his second marriage; the 2nd Earl's eldest son's descendants went on to become Dukes of Newcastle.\n\nThe family has served in public life since the 1st Baron Clinton was summoned to Parliament in 1299, and in the 18th century Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle twice-served as Prime Minister. The peerage of Baron Clinton, created by writ of summons, to which all descendants are in remainder, is now held by another distant branch of the Clinton family.\n\nLord Lincoln's grandson Robert Edward Fiennes-Clinton (born 19 June 1972) is the 19th and present earl, a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, who lives in Perth.\n"}

It coordinates political, social, economic, and industrial campaigns between its affiliate members and implements the policies of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in South Australia.\n\nAs well as implementing policy within South Australia, SA Unions aims to maximise the union movement's effect in political, social, economic and industrial issues; defend and extend the rights of working people and all disadvantaged members of the community; increase the support and relevance of unions; and provide leadership and co-ordination in issues of broad concern to unions and the community.\n\nDuring the 2014 state election, SA Unions ran a targeted campaign of over 190,000 robocalls against Nick Xenophon and his ticket, the Nick Xenophon Team, in response to their policy of reducing penalty rates for weekend workers.\n\nSA Unions operates two in-house legal services. The \"Workers Compensation Service\" provides free advocacy and dispute resolution to workers undergoing a workers compensation claim.\n\nThe \"Young Workers Legal Service\" provides free legal assistance to non-unionised workers under the age of 30 who are experiencing an industrial law dispute. The service is staffed by law student volunteers, and has recovered over $1 million in unpaid entitlements since it was created in 2003.\n\nSA Unions is affiliated with 27 unions within South Australia, including the Australian Education Union (AEU), Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), Australian Services Union (ASU), Australian Workers' Union (AWU), Communications, Electrical, and Plumbing Union (CEPU), Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU), Construction, Forestry, Mining, and Energy Union (CFMEU), Maritime Union of Australia (MUA), United Firefighters Union (UFU), and United Voice (UV).\n\nA United Trades and Labor Council meeting with the purpose of creating an elections committee was convened on 12 December 1890, and held on 7 January 1891. The elections committee was formed, marking the inception of what is today known as the Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch). Originally known as the United Labor Party of South Australia, the party enjoyed immediate success, electing parliamentarians just four months later, and immediately held the balance of power with 10 of 54 seats resulting from the 1893 election, allowing radical liberal Charles Kingston to defeat the conservative John Downer government. Kingston served as Premier of South Australia for a then-record of six and a half years, usually implementing legislation with Labor support. Thomas Price formed the state's first Labor minority government and the world's first stable Labor Party government at the 1905 election with the support of several non-Labor MPs to form the Price-Peake administration, which was re-elected at the 1906 double dissolution election, with Labor falling just two seats short of a majority. So successful, John Verran led Labor to form the state's first of many majority governments at the 1910 election, just two weeks after the 1910 federal election where their federal counterparts formed Australia's first elected majority in either house in the Parliament of Australia, the world's first Labor Party majority government at a national level, and after the 1904 Chris Watson minority government the world's second Labor Party government at a national level. The Australian Labor Party at both a federal and state/colony level pre-dates, among others, both the British Labour Party and the New Zealand Labour Party in party formation, government, and policy implementation. In less than two decades the party in South Australia went from inception to majority government, and would continue to this day as one of the two major parties in the bicameral Parliament of South Australia, the other being the Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division) created in 1974, and its predecessors.\n\nThe United Trades and Labour Council was central to fundraising and building support for the creation of the Port Adelaide Workers Memorial.

{"id": "1966586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966586", "title": "Trichrome staining", "text": "Trichrome staining\n\nTrichrome staining is a histological staining method that uses two or more acid dyes in conjunction with a polyacid. Staining differentiates tissues by tinting them in contrasting colours. It increases the contrast of microscopic features in cells and tissues, which makes them easier to see when viewed through a microscope.\n\nThe word \"trichrome\" means \"three colours\". The first staining protocol that was described as \"trichrome\" was Mallory's trichrome stain, which differentially stained erythrocytes to a red colour, muscle tissue to a red colour, and collagen to a blue colour. Some other trichrome staining protocols are the Masson's trichrome stain, Lillie's trichrome, and the Gömöri trichrome stain.\n\nWithout trichrome staining, discerning one feature from another can be extremely difficult. Smooth muscle tissue, for example, is hard to differentiate from collagen. A trichrome stain can colour the muscle tissue red, and the collagen fibres green or blue. Liver biopsies may have fine collagen fibres between the liver cells, and the amount of collagen may be estimated based on the staining method. Trichrome methods are now used for differentiating muscle from collagen, pituitary alpha cells from beta cells, fibrin from collagen, and mitochondria in fresh frozen muscle sections, among other applications. It helps in identifying increases in collagenous tissue (i.e., fibrotic changes) such as in liver cirrhosis and distinguishing tumours arising from muscle cells and fibroblasts.\n\nTrichrome staining techniques employ two or more acid dyes. Normally acid dyes would stain the same basic proteins, but by applying them sequentially the staining pattern can be manipulated. A polyacid (such as phosphomolybdic acid or tungstophosphoric acid) is used to remove dye selectively. Polyacids are thought to behave as dyes with a high molecular weight: they displace easily removed dye from collagen.\n\nUsually a red dye in dilute acetic acid is applied first to overstain all components. Then a polyacid is applied to remove the red dye from collagen and some other components by displacement. A second acid dye (blue or green) in dilute acetic acid is applied which, in turn, displaces the polyacid, resulting in collagen stained in a contrasting colour to the initial dye used. If erythrocytes are to be stained, a small molecular weight yellow or orange dye is applied before staining with the red dye. It is usually applied from a saturated solution in 80% ethanol and often in conjunction with picric acid (itself a dye) and a polyacid. The methods exploit minor differences in tissue reaction to dyes, density, accessibility and so on.\n\nTrichrome stains in which dyes and a polyacid are applied sequentially are called \"multi-step trichromes\". In \"one-step\" methods, all the dyes—with or without a polyacid—are combined in a single solution. One of the oldest single-step approaches to trichrome staining is van Gieson's method, which stains muscle and cytoplasm yellow, and collagen red. Another is the Gömöri trichrome stain, which closely mimics Masson's trichrome. In \"yellowsolve\" methods, a red dye in dilute acetic acid is first applied, then the section is very thoroughly dehydrated to ensure that no moisture remains. The red dye is then displaced by a yellow dye in a solvent, such as cellosolve (2-ethoxy-ethanol). The name \"yellowsolve\" is a blend of the terms \"yellow\" and \"cellosolve\". Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine for cell inclusions is one example of a yellowsolve stain.\n\nAmong the dyes used for trichrome staining are:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966591", "title": "William Bompas", "text": "William Bompas\n\nWilliam Carpenter Bompas (20 January 1834 – 9 June 1906) was a Church of England clergyman and missionary in northwestern Canada, first Anglican bishop of the Athabasca diocese, then of the Mackenzie River diocese and then of the Selkirk (Yukon) diocese as these dioceses were successively carved out of the original Rupert's Land diocese.\n\nBorn in London, England, he died in Carcross, Yukon. His wife Charlotte Selina (Cox) Bompas participated in his missionary work, and wrote \"Owindia: A True Tale of the Mackenzie River Indians, North-West America\".\n\nWilliam Carpenter Bompas was born on January 20, 1834 at Regent's Park, London to father Charles and mother Mary Steele. It is thought that Charles Carpenter Bompas served as the inspiration for Charles Dickens' Buzfuz in \"The Pickwick Papers\". It is thought that Bompas' heritage lay in France, although members of the extended family resided in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom 1844, a string of family deaths left the family in poor circumstances. When William was aged ten, in February 1844, his father Charles died, leaving his eight children. His eldest son, also named Charles, died in 1847.\n\nWilliam's early education was supplied by a graduate of Cambridge University. Partly due to his private tuition and a lack of socialisation, William was considered a shy boy, and in his spare time preferred to sketch buildings such as churches instead of participate in games. His tutor, a Mr Elliott, believed Bompas to be of high intellect, writing:\n\nI never had a pupil who made such acquisitions of knowledge in so short a time; his attainments in mathematics and classics are far beyond the majority of youths at his age, and would warrant anyone conversant with the state of education in the Universities in predicting a brilliant career for him, should he ever have that path open to him. I think, however, that the development of his mind is still more remarkable than the amount of his knowledge.\n\nHowever, William Carpenter Bompas did not choose to pursue a university education, instead opting to become articled in the same law firm where his brother George was working. After his five years of service, he transferred to another company, which soon collapsed, causing great stress to Bompas. When his strength returned, Bompas decided to leave the Baptist denomination to join the Church of England, becoming confirmed in 1858 and ordained a deacon in 1859. He was appointed curate in a church at Sutton in the Marsh, which had not had a resident clergyman since the 16th century. The area did not have a school, and in the face of considerable opposition, Bompas had opened one within two years.\n\nIn 1861, Bompas' mother died, but undeterred, William transferred to another somewhat 'wild' parish in Nottingham. After a short stint in South Lincolnshire, Bompas returned to Alford, Lincolnshire, where he took up a curate position. Soon after, the Church Missionary Society granted him a post in Rupert's Land, Canada to relieve a bishop. Bompas was quickly ordained into the priesthood and sent away to Canada.\n\nBompas' journey began on June 30, 1865, when he left London for Liverpool, from where he was to take a steamer to New York. From New York Bompas travelled to Niagara via the Hudson River and railway, subsequently making his way to Chicago, La Crosse and St. Paul. Upon reaching St. Cloud, a problem presented itself to Bompas' travelling party. In 1862, a Sioux massacre occurred, and the local Indians were wary of another attack. However, Bompas was advised that they would respect the English flag. Although the party did not have an English flag on hand, Bompas took initiative and crafted a banner for their ox-carts. This was just as well, as Indians who had ridden up in their horses to survey the ox-cart party left them alone once they spotted their flags.\n\nBompas eventually reached the Red River Colony, and from there, he was rowed by Salteaux Indians in Hudson's Bay Company boats. The Methye Portage was reached on October 12, too late to catch a boat going further north due to the ensuing winter. Bompas engaged a crew to row him further north, reaching Fort Chipewyan, Alberta after days of struggle against the cold. Although he was invited to stay the winter at Fort Chipewyan, this offer was rejected, Bompas preferring to push further ahead. When the river became frozen over, his party continued by land, reaching the safety of Fort Resolution mid-winter. After a month's stay there, he was dispatched from there armed with snowshoes and a strong party. Bompas was determined to reach Fort Simpson before Christmas Day, and that he did, drawing into the entrance to the Fort on Christmas morning.\n\nBompas was to remain at Fort Simpson only for a short while. After a brief education in the Indian language there, he continued on to Fort Norman and set up a school there, before returning to Fort Simpson in August 1866. It was decided that Bompas should not be given a post to tend to, rather he should be given a roving commission, which pleased him greatly. Returning to Fort Norman, Bompas began to learn the Slavey language before leaving for Fort Rae in January 1867. In August 1868, after over a year travelling around various Forts, Bompas returned to Fort Simpson to take charge of that mission post after the resignation of the previous missionary there.\n\nIn 1873, Bompas was nominated as the first bishop of the new diocese of Athabasca, in the northwest of his present diocese. Although he was not initially pleased at the prospect of presiding over such a large area, he was convinced otherwise, and in May 1874 Bompas was consecrated bishop of Athabasca at a church in London. He immediately returned to Canada. In 1884, his diocese was divided again, and Bompas became the first bishop of Mackenzie River. In 1891, Bompas moved into the Yukon with the creation of a new diocese, Selkirk. In 1905, he resigned from his position as bishop, and on June 9 the following year, he died at Carcross, Yukon.\n\n\n"}

Criminon International, a non-profit, public-benefit corporation managing the Criminon program, was spawned from Narconon International in 2000, and is part of Association for Better Living and Education's public outreach programs. Criminon is promoted by the Church of Scientology International. Independent experts contend that methods used by the program are not supported by any scientific studies.\n\nSecond Chance, another prison-based rehabilitation program for inmates, is closely related to Criminon, from which it licenses the techniques and materials used in its program.\n\nCriminon is said to be a prison-based version of Narconon, as the Purification Rundown detoxification and training procedures are a part of both programs.\n\nThe program has used correspondence materials to treat hundreds of prisoners at the high security California State Prison, Corcoran, beginning in 1990. Criminon is administered by the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), a nonprofit organization that administers Criminon, Narconon, and other \"social betterment\" programs.\n\nThe program includes courses with questions requiring written answers. The responses are evaluated by volunteers and the materials are donated, so the program is provided free to the state. Included in one pamphlet is an essay in which Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard writes, \"There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who by ordinary criminal law could not be arraigned and convicted of extortion, mayhem, or murder.\"\n\nHubbard's 1981 booklet, \"The Way to Happiness\", is an integral part of the program, setting forth precepts such as \"Do not take harmful drugs\", \"Be faithful to your sexual partner\", \"Do not tell harmful lies\", \"Don't do anything illegal\", \"Do not steal\", and \"Do not murder\".\n\nCriminon is also available under the name Second Chance, which licenses the Criminon materials.\n\nSome critics question the long-term success of Criminon's program citing a lack of independent, peer-reviewed studies. As Criminon's website notes, the core of the prison program is the booklet \"The Way to Happiness\".\n\nIn 1997, Judge Stephen Rushing, a Pinellas County, Florida, judge, received criticism and raised eyebrows from other judges when he began sentencing defendants to a program called \"Impulse Control\" that was run by Criminon. Rushing said the people running the course promised they would not try to convert anyone. However the paper noted that many critics have suggested that Criminon was being used as a recruiting tool. Rushing stated that if the program turned out to be nothing but a ploy to promote Scientology, \"I owe an apology to the people I put in that program.\"\n\nCriminon has also been criticized for promoting Scientology's hostile view of psychiatry. A Criminon instruction manual found at California's Corcoran Prison in 2005 instructs the supervisors who are supposed to be helping the inmates to encourage them to stop taking any psychiatric medication. \"Most jails and prisons have a staff psychiatrist that goes in daily and gives dosages of various and sundry mind-altering drugs to the inmates. Most of the time this is a ploy to keep the inmates sedated so that they don't cause trouble\", the manual stated. While Criminon claimed that this manual was \"outdated\", the replacement manual still advised that if inmates seemed angry, it may be because \"some of them are on psychiatric drugs and have strange side effects as a result.\" Professor Stephen A. Kent said that Scientology's goal \"is to destroy psychiatry and replace it with Scientology's own treatments. Criminon is simply one of many Scientology organizations that hope to see this goal realized.\"\n\nIn 2006, in New Mexico, government funding for the Second Chance program was cut when information on the program and its connections came to light.\n\nThen-Nevada assembly member Sharron Angle supported the use of \"Second Chance Program\" in 2003. Angle sponsored legislation aimed at placing this program in women's prisons in Nevada.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966595", "title": "Riverstone railway station", "text": "Riverstone railway station\n\nRiverstone railway station is a heritage-listed railway station at Riverstone Parade, Riverstone, City of Blacktown, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by NSW Government Railways and William Weaver and built from 1883 to 1939. The station is located on the Richmond line, and is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. The property is owned by RailCorp (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nTwo routes to Windsor were proposed in 1846 for the introduction of railways into the colony of New South Wales. The line was built as the first line to be operated as a horse-drawn tramway. In 1856 a petition for the establishment of a railway from the residents of Windsor and Richmond had been presented to the Government. In 1860 a grant of £57,000 was approved for a railway between Blacktown and Windsor. In the following year it was increased to £60,000 for a railway between Blacktown and Richmond.\n\nThe route of the railway line between Blacktown and Richmond was surveyed in 1862, with construction commencing late in that year. The engineer for the project was William Weaver (1828-1868), a former Colonial Architect of New South Wales. Contracts for earthworks, permanent ways and bridges were let from 1862 to William Randle & G. Gibbons on 11 December 1862. The contract was taken over by Messrs Iredale & McNamara on 28 September 1863.\n\nThe Richmond line opened on 29 November 1864 by Governor Sir John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar as a rural branch line in response to the area's success as a farming district and its location at the intersection of two stock routes. A pilot engine was run before all passenger trains for safety. The original stations were Riverstone, Mulgrave, Windsor and Richmond. An upgrade to the track took place in the late nineteenth century. A major upgrading of most stations on the line occurred in the 1880s.\n\nThe early decades of the 20th century brought further improvements and upgrades to the line. For example, the establishment of Richmond air-force base in 1925 resulted in increased use of the line. In 1938 congestion at Clarendon railway station caused by a Royal Australian Air Force air show resulted in extensive improvements. All stations were increased to 450 feet and additional facilities were installed at Richmond.\n\nRiverstone station was located on the eastern side of the line with a track layout which included a short platform loop, and a siding for general goods and to serve the local sawmill. In addition to the brick platform, the station included a brick built combined waiting room, station office and living quarters constructed in 1864. In 1879 a siding known as Richards Siding was built to service the abattoirs.\n\nCommencing in 1876, Engineer-in-Chief John Whitton undertook the major upgrading of the branch line. At Riverstone a new station, goods siding and shed, and Station Master's residence were completed between 1886 and 1889. The present brick platform building was constructed in 1889. From 1889 the original platform building was used as a Parcels Office and a Post Office. A c.1880s picture from the cover of Grantham Estate Purchasers' Companion and Guide, Boyd & King, Mitchell Library shows the Riverstone railway layout.\n\nThe General Waiting Room was originally divided into two, the main waiting room and the ladies waiting room. In 1946 it was partly converted into an office and was again altered in 1952. Both original waiting rooms had fireplaces, and a World War I Honour Roll hung over the main waiting room fireplace until the 1970s (when it was removed for restoration and then disappeared).\n\nIn 1919, a room was added to the original station building for the Post office. By 1944, the Post office had vacated the structure but it continued to be used as a parcels office, with one room dedicated to the storage of bicycles. In recent years, parts of the structure have been removed.\n\nA timber platform was erected on the loop line in 1939. The line to Riverstone was electrified in 1975 and the platform and small structure were renewed. In 2001, canopies were erected on both platforms.\n\nThe residence was built at the same time as the new station and replaced the former combined office/residence constructed in 1864. The new Station Master's residence conformed to a pattern that evolved in the 1880s which expressed the front elevation asymmetrically, with a verandah extending only halfway across the front and a projecting master bedroom. The design was consistent with other substantial brick residences in the 1880s. It was one of the last residences erected in brick in the 19th century following the arrival of Chief Commissioner, E. M. G. Eddy. The building has had later skillion-roof additions to the rear and side. Considerable internal alterations have also taken place to most rooms, except the bedrooms.\n\nThe signal box was a two-room c.1939 fibro and timber clad building located on the platform. In 1975, a crew amenities building was built at the Richmond end of the platform.\n\nNo buildings other than those on the platform and the 1889 residence survive.\n\nThe War Memorial (owned by Council) was built in 1919 and designed by George Cook, Manager of the Windsor Branch of E.L. Kingsley & Co., monumental masons, and built by E.L. Kingsley & Co. The memorial has continued to be updated with details of military officials engaged in subsequent campaigns. In many towns, war memorials have been placed in station forecourts and at times on platforms. This occurred because of the paucity of available public land on which memorials could be made. Railway stations were once an important and central component of town life and memorials therefore had a high level of visibility. Additionally, many railway men and women volunteered for service in World Wars I and II and their names would appear on the memorials. This is the case at Riverstone.\n\nOn 22 May 1975, Riverstone station became the terminus of the electrified line, with passengers changing to CPH and later 600/700 class railcars for the remainder of the journey to Richmond. On 17 August 1991, the line was electrified to Richmond.\n\n\nBusways operate seven routes to and from Riverstone station:\n\nRiverstone station is served by one NightRide route:\n\nThe station has a number of historically significant buildings:\n\nIt also has a number of historically significant structures:\n\nThe station building on Platform 1 is composed of a number of buildings. The first is a single storey, s face brick symmetrical building with two flanking, parapeted wings, which includes a central waiting room with office on one side and the former ladies waiting room on the other, connecting to toilets in the eastern wing. The western wing is the former lamp room. The wings are linked to the main building by small, flat roofed rooms. The roadside elevation is fronted by an ogee profile timber and iron framed verandah between two projecting wings, while on the rail side there is a cast iron fluted column and metal framed awning with decorative brackets. The roadside faces the motor traffic forecourt which swings around the war memorial. Connected to the eastern end of the main building is a brick building under the same flat roof as the more modern shops that face the road behind it. This is linked to the previously free standing, original ticket office.\n\nInternally, the building has been refurbished except for elements such as timber joinery for doors and windows, wall vents and the enclosed fireplace. Tiles in the waiting room, most ceilings and other items have been replaced.\n\nOn the western side of the main building are two detached buildings. The first is the signal box linked to the main building via a shallow roofed metal shelter. It is a fibro-sheet and weatherboard signal box with corrugated metal gabled roof and concrete base. It is a reasonably large box and an unusual building of later design. The original levers have been removed and only a new signalling board remains. The signal box was closed in 1999.\n\nThe second detached building further to the west of the signal box is a store of similar construction. Further west again is an open passenger shelter with butterfly style corrugated metal awning supported on steel columns and beams. A central steel framed panelled partition divides the both sides of the shelter.\n\nExternal: The parcels office is a painted brick building with corrugated steel hipped roof featuring two segmental arched tall windows in the centre and two doors (one segmental arched original timber door with fanlight, and the other metal later door) on either side of the platform elevation. There are no other openings on the building. Windows are double-hung with multi-paned upper sash.\n\nThis shelter is an aluminium framed structure with glass sides and colorbond gable roof extending as an awning on the platform side.\n\nThis is a large single storey brick Station Master's residence with hipped and pitched corrugated metal roof, a projecting bay and corrugated iron veranda at the front. The veranda is supported on slender timber chamfered posts. It has a later lean to addition in fibro to the side and a timber lean to at the rear. The building is face brick, partly painted and has two brick chimneys with dentilated and corbelled tops. The residence is currently vacant and reflects its recent conversion into a number of units. Most of its original internal elements including fireplace surrounds and ceilings have been removed and damaged. The original timber moulded window and door frames as well as some moulded timber skirting survive. Damaged paling timber fencing along the Riverstone Parade boundary of the property has recently been replaced by timber picket fence together with new timber paling fencing along the platform side of the boundary. The building fronts Garfield Road West and features metal standard railway fencing on this boundary.\n\nIt is a Type 7 (J3) residence. This is a moderately common type, as 13-15 examples exist. It is in poor condition, but is a robust structure. There are building code and disability access issues to be overcome for commercial reuse. However, it is in a prominent position and otherwise has good commercial reuse potential, particularly due to the large backyard.\n\nThe station master's residence has had later skillion-roof additions to the rear and side. Considerable internal alterations have also taken place to most rooms, except the bedrooms.\n\nThe eastern platform is brick faced road side construction raised by five courses above the original 1860s sandstone topped platform. The sandstone topping extends from the precast concrete store building at the northern end to adjacent to the cottage/ticket office at the southern end of the station.\n\nOn west side of the track is a concrete platform.\n\nThe former goods yard has largely been demolished. The only remaining evidence is the rails and timber buffer. A small, recent brick and colorbond shed is also located on the site.\n\nThe corrugated iron per way shed and c.1889 goods shed were removed at an unknown date. This was a 21 x 14 side shed with no awning, a central pair of sliding doors and a window on each side with door and window at one end with separate flight of stairs. The platform extended from the doors to an extended platform to the north with sloped end. The building was simple corrugated iron clad with windows in small Victorian pattern panes. The barge boards were shaped and the eaves construction was elaborate for the use as goods shed indicating an early non-standard building.\n\nThe Gangers Hut was also removed at an unknown date. This was an excellent example of an early gangers hut located with a group of buildings, clad in corrugated iron.\n\nDesigned by George Cook, Manager of the Windsor Branch of E.L. Kingsley & Co., monumental masons, built by E.L. Kingsley & Co. A stone obelisk mounted on a stone base with curb, small gate and small shrubs around the base. The plaque is marble and two rifles are carved into the stone at the front. The entire monument is sited in a paved road island with bollards.\n\nThe War Memorial has been updated with details of military officials engaged in subsequent campaigns.\n\nThe timber platform signs supported on timber posts are intact examples of early station signs that are rapidly diminishing.\n\nThe station retains a Seth Thomas Clock, which was in the process of being repaired and restored at the time of inspection in January 2009.\n\nThere is a potential within the former goods yard for likely surviving elements that are not visible at this time.\n\nAs at 29 January 2015, the station buildings were reported to be in very good condition, both inside and outside. The station master's residence was in very poor condition, particularly internally. All interiors of the residence appear to have been damaged by fire and vandalism. The residence suffers significantly from rising damp possibly due to painting of external walls. It requires urgent repair and maintenance works.\n\nThe siding area on the southern side of the station may contain some archaeological remnants.\n\nThe station buildings are of high integrity and remain intact. The Station Master's residence has moderate integrity and has lost its intactness. The overall integrity of the station has been relatively reduced by the removal of the 1864 original station building.\n\nRiverstone Station is significant as part of the original construction phase of the Richmond line in the 1860s that provided access to the settlements on the Hawkesbury River and the markets of Sydney. The station probably influenced the establishment of the meatworks at Riverstone by Benjamin Richards in 1878 and it retains the complex of structures associated with the major upgrading works of the Richmond branch line that commenced during the 1880s by the Engineer-in-Chief, John Whitton. The 1889 station building retains much of its original detailing and is intact. The overall integrity of the station has been relatively reduced by the removal of the original 1860s station building, and only part of the early platform remains from this period. Notwithstanding, the station group is a key element in the townscape of Riverstone providing the interface between the railway line and the historic Riverstone Township subdivision of 1877.\n\nThe former Station Master's residence is significant as a representative example of a late-nineteenth century Station Master's residence constructed in brick. The construction of the building is associated with the former prominence of the railway in Riverstone, brought about by the development of the meatworks. The building is centrally located in the town of Riverstone, however, its landmark qualities have been significantly reduced by the later additions and modifications.\n\nRiverstone railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nRiverstone Station is historically significant as physical evidence of the original construction phase of the Richmond line in the 1860s that provided access to the settlements on the Hawkesbury River and the markets of Sydney. The station probably influenced the establishment of the meatworks at Riverstone by Benjamin Richards in 1878. The station retains the complex of 1880s structures associated with the major upgrading works of the Richmond branch line by the Engineer-in-Chief, John Whitton. The station group is a key element in the townscape of Riverstone providing the interface between the railway line and the historic Riverstone township subdivision of 1877.\n\nThe construction of the Station Master's residence (as part of a general upgrade) in the 1880s demonstrates the importance of the Riverstone goods and freight traffic to the New South Wales Government Railways.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nThe 1880s to 1940s upgrades of the station complex are good representative examples of railway civil engineering practice for their respective periods. The main 1889 station building is a good example of second class station buildings featuring typical characteristics of this design including symmetrical face brick main building flanked with two parapeted wings planned around a central waiting room.\n\nThe Station Master's residence was a good example of a government institutional residence in brick of the late nineteenth century, retaining original features such as window and door fenestration, verandah, and brick chimneys. However, later fibro and timber lean-to additions as well as removal of almost all internal finishes and decorative elements has reduced significantly its aesthetic and architectural quality.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe Riverstone Station has high research potential in providing evidence of a complex of station structures built in the 1860s through the late 1880s.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe station contains rare examples of mid 1860s railway civil engineering practice, namely the station platform (part).\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nRiverstone Station is a representative example of station layout of the late 19th century including station buildings, residence, parcels office and signal box; and has representative significance for demonstrating widespread 19th Century railway customs, activities and design in NSW.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966606", "title": "Hydroxyapatite", "text": "Hydroxyapatite\n\nHydroxyapatite, also called hydroxylapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca(PO)(OH), but it is usually written Ca(PO)(OH) to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. It crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system. Pure hydroxyapatite powder is white. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of dental fluorosis.\n\nUp to 50% by volume and 70% by weight of human bone is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, known as bone mineral. Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are composed. Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the pineal gland and other structures, known as corpora arenacea or 'brain sand'.\n\nHydroxyapatite can be synthesized via several methods, such as wet chemical deposition, biomimetic deposition, sol-gel route (wet-chemical precipitation) or electrodeposition. Yagai and Aoki proposed the hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below:\n\n10 Ca(OH) + 6 HPO → Ca(PO)(OH) + 18 HO\n\nSeveral studies have shown that hydroxyapatite synthesis via the wet-chemical route can be improved by high-power ultrasound. The ultrasonically assisted synthesis (sono-synthesis) of hydroxyapatite is a successful technique for the production of nanostructured hydroxyapatite to high quality standards. The ultrasonic route allows the production of nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite as well as modified particles, e.g. core-shell nanospheres and composites.\n\nCalcium-deficient (non-stochiometric) hydroxyapatite, Ca(PO)(HPO)(OH) (where \"x\" is between 0 and 1) has a Ca/P ratio between 1.67 and 1.5. The Ca/P ratio is often used in the discussion of calcium phosphate phases. Stoichiometric apatite Ca(PO)(OH) has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The non-stoichiometric phases have the hydroxyapatite structure with cation vacancies (Ca) and anion (OH) vacancies. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO, anions. \nPreparation of these calcium-deficient phases can be prepared by precipitation from a mixture of calcium nitrate and diammonium phosphate with the desired Ca/P ratio, for example, to make a sample with a Ca/P ratio of 1.6:\n\nSintering these non-stoichiometric phases forms a solid phase which is an intimate mixture of tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite, termed biphasic calcium phosphate:\n\nThe clubbing appendages of the \"Odontodactylus scyllarus\" (peacock mantis shrimp) are made of an extremely dense form of the mineral which has a higher specific strength and toughness than any synthetic composite material; these properties have led to its investigation for potential synthesis and engineering use. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness. A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. This periodic layer also reduces the energy transferred across both layers due to the large difference in modulus, even reflecting some of the incident energy.\n\nHydroxyapatite is present in bone and teeth; bone is made primarily of HA crystals interspersed in a collagen matrix—65 to 70% of the mass of bone is HA. Similarly HA is 70 to 80% of the mass of dentin and enamel in teeth. In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by amelogenins and enamelins instead of collagen.\n\nHydroxyapatite deposits in tendons around joints results in the medical condition calcific tendinitis.\n\nHydroxyapatite is added to some variations of cornstarch based baby powder such as Johnson's Aloe & Vitamin E powder. According the website, the mineral is added as an emollient to \"help moisturize and soften skin.\"\n\nHA is increasingly used to make bone grafting materials as well as dental prosthetics and repair. Some implants, e.g. hip replacements, dental implants and bone conduction implants, are coated with HA. As the native dissolution rate of hydroxyapatite in-vivo, around 10 wt% per year, is significantly lower than the growth rate of newly formed bone tissue, in its use as a bone replacement material, ways are being sought to enhance its solubility rate and thus promote better bioactivity.\n\nMicrocrystalline hydroxyapatite (MCHA) is marketed as a \"bone-building\" supplement with superior absorption in comparison to calcium.\n\nIt is a second-generation calcium supplement derived from bovine bone. In the 1980s, bone meal calcium supplements were found to be contaminated with heavy metals, and although the manufacturers claim their MCHA is free from contaminants, it isn't recommended because its effect in the body has not been well-tested.\n\nThe mechanism of hydroxyapatite chromatography is complicated and has been described as \"mixed-mode\". It involves ionic interactions between positively charged groups on a biomolecule (often a protein) and the phosphate groups in hydroxyapatite, and metal chelation between hydroxyapatite calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate and/or carboxyl groups on the biomolecule. It may be difficult to predict the effectiveness of hydroxyapatite chromatography based on physical and chemical properties of the desired protein to be purified. For elution, a buffer with increasing phosphate and/or neutral salt concentration is typically used.\n\nIn archaeology, hydroxyapatite from human and animal remains can be analysed to reconstruct ancient diets, migrations and paleoclimate. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of trace elements, including carbon, oxygen and strontium. Stable isotope analysis of human and faunal hydroxyapatite can be used to indicate whether a diet was predominantly terrestrial or marine in nature (carbon, strontium); the geographical origin and migratory habits of an animal or human (oxygen, strontium) and to reconstruct past temperatures and climate shifts (oxygen). Post-depositional alteration of bone can contribute to the degradation of bone collagen, the protein required for stable isotope analysis.\n\nHydroxyapatite is a potential adsorbent for the defluoridation of drinking water, as it forms fluorapatite in a 3 step process. Hydroxyapatite removes F from the water to replace OH forming fluorapatite. However, during the defluoridation process the HA dissolves, and increases the pH and phosphate ion concentration which makes the defluoridated water unfit for drinking. Recently, a ″calcium amended-hydroxyapatite″ defluoridation technique was suggested to overcome the phosphate leaching from HA. This technique can also affect fluorosis reversal by providing calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water to fluorosis affected areas.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966608", "title": "Clunes, Victoria", "text": "Clunes, Victoria\n\nClunes is a town in Victoria, Australia, 36 kilometres north of Ballarat, in the Shire of Hepburn. At the 2016 census it had a population of 1,728.\n\nThe Djadja Wurrung people were the first inhabitants of the region including the settlement which later became Clunes.\n\nThe town was home to Victoria's first registered gold discovery made by William Campbell in 1850. This discovery was not made public until 1851. In 1851 German Herman Brunn visited the site of Campbell's discovery on Donald Cameron's run the 'Clunes'. He then traveled the area informing all he met of the find on Cameron's run 'Clunes'. He told James Esmond who traveled to Clunes and inspected the site and collected a gold sample which he took to gold assayer in Geelong on 7 July 1851. He also informed Arthur Clark editor of the \"Geelong Advertiser\", requesting that nothing would be said until he returned from Melbourne with equipment. In August 1851 a Mr. Davies from Avoca revealed in the \"Geelong Advertiser\" that the site was at Clunes. William Campbell's announcement in Melbourne and Davies news item triggered the gold rush in Victoria. The township was established a few years later and subsequent gold mining predominantly driven by the Port Phillip and Colonial Mining Company which was mining the site of the discovery saw the town's population rising to well over 6,000 residents in the late 1880s.\n\nClunes post office opened as early as 1 October 1857 and in 1874 Clunes was connected to the Victorian railway network. Clunes station was opened in the same year.\n\nIn 1873 mine employers attempted to introduce Saturday afternoon and Sunday shifts. The miners refused to sign the new terms outlined in their contract renewals and went on a strike that lasted 3 months. Some days into the action the miners organised the Clunes Miners' Association and what were to become known as the Clunes riots, successfully resisting the use of Chinese labour from Creswick as strikebreakers.\n\nFrom the 1850s through to 1893, when gold mining eventually came to an end, Clunes was an important gold production location in Victoria. Surrounded by grassland, meadows and pastures, the town has preserved many of its elegant historic buildings until today and is recognised as one of the architecturally most-intact gold towns in Victoria.\n\nThe Clunes Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1983.\n\n\nThe idea of transforming Clunes into a European-style booktown was first conceived and developed by Councillor Tim Hayes, Linda Newitt, Graeme Johnston and Tess Brady. Clunes held its first 'Booktown for a Day' event on 20 May 2007. Over 50 booksellers from around Australia set up shop for the day in the town's heritage buildings.\n\nRenamed to 'Back to Booktown' a year later and to 'Clunes Booktown Festival' in 2012, the township now holds the event each year on the first weekend in May. It has become the largest collection of books in any regional centre of Australia and the major Victorian regional book event.\n\n\nIn recent years Clunes has undergone a noticeable transformation and rejuvenation following the decision by Wesley College, Australia's largest co-educational private school, to establish a campus for Year 9 students in the town. Opened in 2000, about 80 students take up residency in the Wesley Clunes Residential Learning Village in the centre of town and become part of the local community for an eight-week period each term. where they learn how to take care of themselves for when they grow up.\n\nMany of the external scenes and some internal scenes in the 2003 film \"Ned Kelly\", starring Heath Ledger, were shot in Clunes.

{"id": "1966626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966626", "title": "Beechworth", "text": "Beechworth\n\nBeechworth is a well-preserved historical town located in the north-east of Victoria, Australia, famous for its major growth during the gold rush days of the mid-1850s. At the , Beechworth had a population of 2,789.\n\nBeechworth's many historical buildings are well preserved and the town has re-invented itself and evolved into a popular tourist destination and growing wine-producing centre.\n\nOriginally used for grazing by the settler David Reid, the area was known as Mayday Hills until 1853, when it was renamed Beechworth. The Post Office opened on 1 May 1853 as Spring Creek and was renamed Beechworth on 1 January 1854.\n\nLieutenant-Governor La Trobe visited the settlement in May 1853 and instructed Government Surveyor Robert Brough Smyth to lay out the principal streets of the town and survey allotments.\n\nIn its golden heyday from 1852–1857, this was a fabulous gold region and centre of government; but its power, wealth and influence were short lived. At its wildest moments of gold discoveries, Woods related how an early party of prospectors retrieved a pan of gold weighing . Another lucky party, said Woods, cleared some of gold in a week. And so began a rush into this remote region. During the first election campaign in 1855, one candidate, Daniel Cameron, rode a horse shod with solid gold horseshoes. The extravagance of this event is still commemorated as the logo for Beechworth is a golden horseshoe.\n\nAt the time, Beechworth was far removed from the centre of colonial administration in Melbourne both in distance and time taken to travel. The local debates around the potential railway into Beechworth encompassed a broad gauge () option or a narrow gauge () system, between Wangaratta and Beechworth and these debates and options appeared in the \"Ovens and Murray Advertiser\" newspaper. Ironically, in the 1890s a narrow gauge system did eventuate nearby, running from Wangaratta to Whitfield. Finally a railway, the broad gauge, arrived at Beechworth in September 1876, but by that stage the town and its gold production was waning. Unfortunately the rail line was closed in 1977 and dismantled, after 101 years of service.\n\nDuring its boom times, Beechworth town boasted a range of industries including, a tannery, jewellers, boot makers, a brewery, blacksmiths, livestock sale yards. It had schools, a convent, hotels, a prison with imposing stone walls, a hospital, a mental hospital, court house, police barracks, stage coach companies and a powder magazine.\n\nIn its golden days, men and women arrived from, the United States, United Kingdom and China. At its peak, Beechworth town had over 3,100 residents. Surrounding areas and mining camps sprang up as thousands of miners rushed into areas such as Spring Creek, Reedy Creek, Silver Creek, the Nine Mile Creek and the Woolshed increasing the population on the Ovens to around 22,000. The Chinese were not allowed to live in Beechworth town and resided on the outskirts. Numerous controls and enforced regulations and licence checks existed against the Chinese miners.(see: Woods; also McWaters; also O'Brien; and Cronin). Beechworth Cemetery has a large preserved section of early Chinese miners/pioneers. The presence of the Chinese goldminers around Beechworth and throughout Victoria's north-eastern region created social unrest and these are recorded in O'Brien's; Woods'; and Cronin's works below.\n\nThe Beechworth Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\n\nLike many Australian country towns associated with the early goldfields, Beechworth had its share of colourful characters and villains. Among the infamous during the 1870s was the one-time Livery Stable owner, later the 'Dog Officer', at some other time the 'Pound Officer' and another time shire revenue officer, John Phelan. Phelan was a continual litigant, correspondent to the newspapers and advertiser. His official and officious escapades were mockingly reported in the local paper.\n\nRobert O'Hara Burke, leader of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition was stationed in Beechworth as Senior Inspector of Police from 1854 to 1857. Policeman John Sadleir, one of the Kelly Gang pursuers, was also stationed in Beechworth during its early days.(Harvey)\n\nThe Burke Museum is located in Loch Street and holds a rich source of primary materials on Beechworth and the surrounding districts golden past. Source materials include newspapers, photos, artefacts, clothings, paintings, exhibitions, published local histories and unpublished theses on the district and displays dating back to the gold discoveries, early Chinese miners and workings of the 1850s. For family and academic researchers this museum is a gold mine.\n\nIsaac Isaacs was Australia's first native-born Governor-General, appointed in 1931.\nThe Isaac family move to Beechworth to help Isaac gain a better quality education, in 1867, first enrolling him in the Common school then in the Beechworth Grammar School. He became dux in his first year. In his second year he was employed part-time as an assistant teacher at the school, and took up after school tutoring of fellow students. In September 1870, when Isaacs was just 15 years old, he passed his examination as a pupil teacher and taught at the school from then until 1873. Isaacs was next employed as an assistant teacher at the Beechworth State School, the successor to the Common school.\nFrom 1875 Isaacs moved to Melbourne for work and to undertake Law studies. His connection to Beechworth was re-established when he was elected as the member for Bogong in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from May 1892 until May 1893 and between June 1893 and May 1901.\nIsaacs further represented Beechworth and surrounding areas when he was elected to the first Federal Parliament in 1901 to the seat of Indi. He served until 1906 when he was appointed to the High Court.\n\nThe outlaw Ned Kelly had many links to Beechworth – he spent time in HM Prison Beechworth and fought a famous boxing bout with Isaiah \"Wild\" Wright in the back of a local hotel. Aaron Sherritt and Joe Byrne of the Kelly Gang came from the Woolshed goldmining camp, outside of Beechworth town. It was in Beechworth gaol that twenty-one men, suspected Kelly Gang supporters, relatives and other sympathisers were held without trial or evidence for over three months, by the Chief Commissioner of Police Captain Standish, under the \"Outlawry Act\".\n\nGeorge B. Kerferd (1836–1889) a longtime resident of Beechworth became a Premier of Victoria and was a major participant in ensuring Beechworth had a railway connection to Melbourne.\n\nCastieau (1831–1885) was the Prison Governor at Beechworth from 1856 to 1869. The prison, famous for its huge granite walls was known as \"Castieau's castle\". As the Governor of the Melbourne gaol in 1880 he was an official witness to the hanging of Ned Kelly. His diaries were later published (2004) as \"The Difficulties of My Position\". In this book a drawing from \"the Australian Sketcher\", 14 August 1880 shows Castieau sitting with Ned Kelly during his remand (p. 278) and also a photo of his signature as one of the witnesses to the Kelly hanging (p. viii).\n\nBorn in 1897 died in 1983. Sportsman, businessman and sports administrator.\n\nBorn in 1886, died in 1962. Judge.\n\nBeechworth features an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") with warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. As one of the higher towns in Victoria, snowfalls can be expected each year.\n\nIn its golden heyday Beechworth boasted two influential newspapers: \"The Ovens and Murray Advertiser\" and \"The Constitution and Mining Intelligencer\". These papers engaged in fierce competition and for a while were daily issues. The papers circulated far and wide throughout the district and the colony of Victoria.(O'Brien) Both papers represented the views of their respective readerships sometimes to the exclusion of all others.(O'Brien) Even today, these old papers are an important historical research tool, as most editions from the early 1850 survive and are micro-filmed and are available at the Burke Museum, and most state and National libraries throughout Australia. These two local papers provide rich primary sources for many historians of Beechworth and its surrounds, plus the Kelly Gang historians.(See: Woods (1985); McMahon (2000); Lane (1978); McQuilton (1979); Jones (1995); McWaters (2002); O'Brien (2005); and Wild & McMahon (2006))\n\n\"The Ovens and Murray Advertiser\" still survives as a local paper.\n\nBeechworth is a popular tourist destination. Attractions include Ned Kelly themed displays at the old court house and Ned Kelly Weekend, which is Australia's most significant recreation of the Kelly legend it commemorates the anniversary of the outlaw's committal hearing held in the historic Beechworth Courthouse from 6 to 11 August 1880. Other popular draws to the area are its many annual festivals, including the famous Golden Horseshoes Festival Easter Parade through centre of town, The Burke Museum, waterfalls, Gun Powder Magazine, Newtown Bridge (Stone Bridge), Tail Race (Mining Race), Spring Creek Water Falls, Spring Creek Gorge, Beechworth Lunatic Asylum ghost tours, lakes, historic buildings, goldfields, walks, the Beechworth Bakery, Beechworth Honey, brewery, the lolly shop and night tours, the restaurants and wineries. The town is one end point of the Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail.\n\nThe music video for famous singer/actor Jason Donovan's 1989 hit \"Too Many Broken Hearts\" was filmed in Beechworth.\n\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Tallangatta & District Football League.\n\nGolfers play at the Beechworth Golf Club on Balaclava Road. A dedicated cross-country and downhill mountain biking track, the Beechworth Mountain Bike Park, is maintained by the Beechworth Chain Gang Mountain Bike Club.\n\nConsidering the present nature of the town, a surprising range and variety of books exist on Beechworth town, its adjoining goldfield camps, its surrounds and its heady goldfield days. These include numerous histories, a treasure of local histories, theses, material on bushrangers, police, Chinese, riots, the coming and going of the railway and novels set in the district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is on the Murray River which forms the border between Victoria and New South Wales. Cobram along with the nearby towns of Numurkah and Yarrawonga is part of Shire of Moira and is the administrative centre of the Council. Its twin town of Barooga is located on the north side of the Murray River. Surrounding Cobram are a number of orchards, dairy farms and wineries. At the 2016 census, Cobram had a population of 6,014. Barooga's population is currently 1,817.\n\nAboriginals, although they had disappeared from the area prior to European settlement, were believed to inhabit the stretch of region bound by the Murray River from Tocumwal to the east of Cobram and south as far as the Broken Creek. Unfortunately, the area bound by Melbourne, Echuca and Albury was a trouble area for recording Aboriginal presence. The main tribe believed to have occupied the area were the Bangerang. A 'horde', or smaller grouping of about 100 persons, named Angootheraban, are believed to have lived in the immediate Cobram area.\n\nCharles Sturt first passed through the region on the northern bank of the Murray River in June 1838 en route to South Australia, leading a cattle droving party, with 300 head of cattle.\n\nIn January 1845, Octavius Phillpotts established Cobram station between the already existing Yarrawonga and Strathmerton stations, located where Cobram East now is. This was divided into the Cobram and St. James stations in 1855.\n\nBy the 1860s, present day Cobram still hadn't begun to exist, and the area was still broadly referred to as Yarroweyah. In 1868, the old township of Cobram, bound by Warkil Street to the west and the Murray River to the east was reserved for future use, about 15 kilometres west of Cobram East.\n\nUp until this time, the area of Cobram was part of the Echuca Shire, Cobram station was included when Yarrawonga Shire was created on 15 May 1878. It would later be part of the Tungamah shire in its creation on 17 February 1893. On 12 August 1879 the first school, 2166 Cobram, opened, later renamed Cobram East.\n\nIn 1886, the government produced the town plan for Cobram, as section 110. 1888 brought about the establishment of the township proper, with the opening of the primary school, Cobram 2881, in April, the opening of the Cobram Post Office near the court house on 1 May, and the coming of the railway on 1 October, which had been heavily publicised by the Cobram Courier, the town's newspaper, first issued 12 September of that year. It was also in 1888 that the first policeman was appointed, the first doctor arrived and Cobram Football Club played its first match along with the building of Cobram's first pub, the Royal Victoria Hotel. A river punt began operating between Cobram and the New South Wales banks the following year.\n\nThe Cobram Post Office was moved to its present site on 23 February 1904, the first government building in town and the first built in Australia with the authority of the Commonwealth government.\n\nCobram township was finally proclaimed by Sir John Fuller, Governor of Victoria, on 2 December 1912. Two years later, electricity for the town was being produced by a local coal-fired power plant.\n\nSt. Joseph's Catholic primary school was opened in 1922 and in 1925, the Cobram Golf Club opened a 9-hole course near the Murray Valley Highway, transferring three years later to the current location in Barooga.\n\nCobram adopted yet another town plan in 1949, the first rural Victorian town to do so, with high anticipation of population growth and the proliferation of industry. In 1950, the first of such expansions was realised, with the creation of the Murray Valley Co-operative Dairy Producers and Trading Company, the predecessor of Murray Goulburn Co-operative.\n\nThe town split from Tungamah Shire and Cobram Shire was formed on 1 April 1953, after increasing agitation from the townspeople with the operations of the Tungamah Shire. The first Shire President was Mr Norm Jordan, a long-standing Cobram businessman. Almost ten years later, in 1962, the first high school opened in the town. In May 1972, the first connections to town sewerage were made, totaling 1,000 by 1976.\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, Cobram was awarded many town awards, including Tidiest Town in Victoria in 1991 and 1993. In 1993, Cobram Shire was amalgamated with Yarrawonga, Numurkah, Nathalia and Tungamah Shires to form the Moira Shire.\n\nCobram serves as the headquarters for the Shire of Moira, is centrally located within the shire and is the second-largest town. Cobram has one government high school and a primary school, an Anglican prep to year 12 college, a Catholic primary school and a special developmental school. It also has a district hospital, built in 1949 with emergency department and an associated nursing home for the elderly.\n\nThere are numerous recreational facilities for public use, such as Scott Reserve, the Cobram Showgrounds, Cobram Lawn Tennis Club and of course the Murray River including Thompson's Beach. A large sports stadium is located adjacent to the Anglican College and Cobram Showgrounds, with numerous soccer fields, netball and tennis courts outside, along with indoor basketball, badminton, volleyball, tennis and netball courts.\n\nThe Melba Theatre first opened on 1 December 1948. Featuring a lobby and two cinemas, it was the first air-conditioned theatre in the region. A fire destroyed the cinema and caused damage to surrounding shops on 10 April 2010 and it was demolished the following day.\n\nA Peaches & Cream Festival is held biennially around the second or third weekend in January. It is Australia's oldest-running festival, with a town parade and music festival located at Thompson's Beach.\n\nCobram is the birthplace of Murray Goulburn Co-operative, Australia's largest dairy co-operative, collecting 35% of Australia's milk produce through its numerous facilities throughout south eastern Australia. Murray Goulburn, along with the Meiji Dairy Corporation milk processing plant, a large abattoir and orange juice factories form the major industries of the town as well as serving as major employers.\n\nCobram is home to a large Muslim community of mainly Iraqi origin which continues to grow quickly, along with Italians who migrated in the post-war boom, and began a thriving fruit industry.\n\nIn 2006, the then 104-year-old De Burgh Truss road bridge over the river was replaced by a concrete type immediately adjacent to and upstream of the original bridge, named Cobram Barooga Bridge. The new bridge was built to a cost of $9.6 million and completed ahead of schedule.\n\nSmaller towns located nearby include Strathmerton, home of a large Bega cheese processing plant, Yarroweyah, Katamatite, Katunga, Koonoomoo and the larger towns of Yarrawonga on the Victorian side and Tocumwal on the New South Wales side.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,014 people in Cobram.\n\nAlthough there are no named suburbs in the town, there are areas which can be distinguished by locals due to their colloquial names.\n\nThe Mill End is the oldest area name, given to the old Cobram town bound by Warkil Street to the west and the river to the east, so named because of the timber mills that were once scattered in the area. It is still used, although not as commonly, by people and business.\n\nMurray Heights is the name given to the estate of relatively recent residential area that runs along the sand hills of River Road on the town's eastern edge. The sandy mounds had previously been occupied by orchards.\n\nKoonoomoo, Yarroweyah and Cobram East share the same post code as Cobram, as does Barooga despite being in NSW.\n\nCobram has an Australian rules football team in the Murray Football League called the Cobram Tigers. Cobram has one soccer team named Cobram Roar which participate in the Albury Wodonga Football Association games. Cobram also has two cricket teams which play in the Murray Valley Cricket Association games, one being Cobram Yarroweyah United, which is based at Scott Oval in Cobram.\n\nOther popular sports played include basketball, table tennis, ballet, motorcross, netball, lawn tennis, badminton and lawn bowls. Cobram Bowling Club is centrally located and has three grass greens. The club has two ladies' pennant teams and four Saturday pennant sides which participate in the Murray Bowls Association.\n\nGolfers play at the Cobram Barooga Golf Club on Barooga Golf Course Road.\n\nThe Cobram Lawn Tennis Club hosts an annual tournament over Labour Day#Australia Weekend (usually the first weekend of March). It is attended by around 750 tennis players from around Victoria, with most travelling from Melbourne for the weekend. The tournament concludes with the finals on Labour Day Monday.\n\nV/Line once serviced Cobram with regular daily passenger trains as part of the Shepparton service. These train services were discontinued in 1993. Now V/Line operates multiple daily return connecting coach services between Cobram and Melbourne,<ref name=\"V/Line1\"></ref> as well as multiple return services to Albury and Mildura.<ref name=\"V/Line2\"></ref>\n\nNSW TrainLink, the New South Wales regional rail and coach provider, services Cobram with three-times-weekly Sydney and return services via Albury.\n\nCobram has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool, wet winters. The area has 300 days of sunshine a year. The average wettest day Cobram would have is around 30 millimetres.\n\nA major landmark is the Cobram Bridge, a De Burgh truss lift bridge, which was built across the Murray in 1902. The Cobram Bridge is the only bridge on the Murray River whose construction was completely funded by the Victorian government. Tenders were awarded in November 1900 and the bridge was opened officially on 3 December 1902, two months after being open to traffic.\n\nOther landmarks include the settlers' log cabin, war memorial and civic centre. Also of note is the Cobram courthouse, built in 1912, which continues to be utilised as the Cobram Magistrates' Court. Most of the old brick buildings were of local bricks, made by Samuel Steward. He has a monument on the Cobram to Barooga Road.\n\nCobram Station, built from 1905 to 1907, is a large homestead located east of the town on the Murray Valley Highway. The building comprises 250,000 bricks hand-made on site. It is currently a private residence.\n\nAround the region are numerous river beaches, with Thompson's Beach, claimed to be the largest inland beach in Australia located just north of Mookarii Street, before crossing into New South Wales.\n\n\n"}

At the , Yarrawonga had a population of 7,930.\n\nYarrawonga is served by a standard gauge branch railway, which branches off the Melbourne-Sydney line at Benalla and terminates at Oaklands in New South Wales.\nYarrawonga's main attraction is Lake Mulwala, formed by the damming of the Murray River. The lake is a popular location for activities such as boating, kayaking and fishing. There are two crossings of the Murray between Yarrawonga and Mulwala; across the weir (a stock route carrying a single lane of traffic); and a bridge over Lake Mulwala. This bridge contains an unusual bend and dip in the middle, a result of miscommunication between the two state governments.\n\nThe Yarrawonga Football Club (the 'Mighty Pigeons') participates in the Ovens and Murray Football League in the sport of Australian rules football, which has produced the likes of Barry Mitchell, Joel Smith, Ben Dixon, and Tom Lonergan.\n\nYarrawonga Post Office opened on 28 November 1874.\n\nHistorically, one of the major industries in the Yarrawonga/ Mulwala area has been the explosives factory, which was constructed in Mulwala over 1942–43.

The song appeared on Harry Belafonte's album \"Calypso\". It reached number fourteen on the \"Billboard\" Pop chart. The lyrics for the song were written by Lord Burgess (Irving Burgie), an American-born, half-Barbadan songwriter. It is about the beauties of the West Indian Islands. \n\nMany, including Belafonte himself, have said that the song was popular in the West Indies since long before Burgess. It is believed that Burgess compiled and modified the song from many folk pieces to make a new song. Burgess acknowledged his use of the tune of another mento, \"Iron Bar\".\n\nThe Kingston Trio, who led the folk revival of the late 1950s, took their name from the mention of Kingston, Jamaica in the song, though they only recorded it many years later, in 2006.\n\nThe line \"ackee, rice, saltfish is nice\" refers to the Jamaican national dish. \n\nArtists who have covered \"Jamaica Farewell\" include:\n\nThis song has been translated into many languages. For example, in Bengali, there exist several translations, some of which are quite well known. One Bengali version of the song became an important anthem for the Naxalite revolutionary movement in the 1970s and thus has significance for Bengali intellectuals in Kolkata society. The Bangladeshi band Souls also sang their own translated version in early 1990s, which instantly became a hit in Bangladesh.\n\nThe song was covered with lyrics in Swedish by Schytts as \"Jamaica farväl\", scoring a 1979 Svensktoppen hit. Streaplers recorded a 1967 Swedish-language version of the song, with the lyrics \"Långt långt bort\". Their version became a 1968 Svensktoppen hit.\n\nGerman translations are \"Abschied von Kingston Town\" (Farewell from Kingston Town) by Bruce Low and \"Weil der Sommer ein Winter war\" (For the Summer was a Winter) by Nana Mouskouri.\n\nIn his album \"My Son, the Folk Singer\", Allan Sherman included a parody of the song: \"I'm upside down, my head is spinning around, because I gotta sell the house in Levittown!\"\n\nA filk music parody \"Change at Jamaica Farewell\" makes fun of the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nThis song was featured in the 2009 video game \"Rabbids Go Home\" at numerous points in the game.

This working life inspired the poem from which came one of the May 1968 protest slogans \"métro-boulot-dodo\" (\"subway-work-sleep\") that denounced the shocking workers' conditions at the time.\n\nWhile commanding a trawler to aid the French evacuations in 1940, he was captured and was detained in the concentration camp at Aintree. His poems from that point onwards centred on the sea and the war.\n\nAfter the war he took a post as a press attaché in Africa. In 1969, he created a quarterly magazine for himself alone: \"Le Lien\" (The Link). In 1975, he withdrew to Montlhéry where the peace allowed him to write many fables.\n\nIn 1998, the first volume of his complete works was published: \"L'arc en ciel de ma vie\" (\"The rainbow of my life\").

It is spoken in the Opobo–Nkoro LGA of Rivers State, in the Defaka or Afakani ward of Nkọrọ town and Ịwọma Nkọrọ. The low number of Defaka speakers, coupled with the fact that other languages dominate the region where Defaka is spoken, edges the language near extinction on a year-to-year basis. It is generally classified in an Ijoid branch of the Niger–Congo family. However, the Ijoid proposal is problematic. Blench (2012) notes that \"Defaka has numerous external cognates and might be an isolate or independent branch of Niger–Congo which has come under Ịjọ influence.\"\n\nEthnically, the Defaka people are distinct from the Nkoroo, but they have assimilated to Nkoroo culture to such a degree that their language seems to be the only sign of a distinct Defaka identity. Use of the Defaka language however is quickly receding in favour of the language of the Nkoroo, an Ijaw language. Nowadays, most Defaka speakers are elderly people, and even among these, Defaka is rarely spoken — the total number of Defaka speakers is at most 200 nowadays (SIL/Ethnologue 15th ed.). The decrease in use of Defaka is stronger in Nkoroo town than in the Iwoma area. Since the language communities between Defaka and Nkoroo are so intertwined, it is hard to determine which language influences the other. All children grow up speaking Nkoroo (an Ijo language) as a first language. The next most used language among the Defaka is Igbo, owing to the political influence of the Opobo since the days of the Oil Rivers Trade. Igbo has been a language of instruction in many schools in the region and still functions as a regional trade language.\n\nThe Defaka language shows many lexical similarities with Ijọ, some shared regular sound correspondences and some typological similarities with proto-Ịjọ. For example, both languages have a subject–object–verb basic word order, which is otherwise extremely rare in the Niger–Congo language family, being found only in the Mande and Dogon branches.\nAlso, Defaka has a sex-gender system distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and neuter 3rd-person singular pronouns; this is once again a rarity among south-central Niger–Congo languages other than Ịjoid and Defaka.\nWhile some of the lexical and maybe typological similarities can be attributed to borrowing (as Defaka has been in close contact with Ijọ for more than 300 years), the sound correspondences point to a (somewhat distant) genealogical relationship.\n\nNearly all Defaka are bilingual in Nkọrọọ, and the phonology appears to be the same as that language.\n\nDefaka has two tones, and . On long vowels and diphthongs, as well as disyllabic words, and contours occur. In addition, there is a downstep that may appear between high tones, and which is the remnant of an elided low tone. However, Shryock et al. were not able to measure significant differences in the pitch traces of , , and –downstep–, all of which have a falling pitch, suggesting that there may be fewer distinctive word tones than the combinations of syllable tones would suggest. However, these all clearly contrast with level-pitched and rising-pitched .\n\nThe Ijoid vowel harmony has collapsed in Defaka, as it has in Nkọrọọ. There are seven oral vowels, , though and are uncommon. There are five nasal vowels, . All may occur long. Long vowels are at least twice as long as short vowels.\n\nMost voiceless obstruents are tenuis. However, has a slightly negative voice onset time. That is, voicing commences somewhat before the consonant is released, as in English \"voiced\" stops such as \"b.\" This is typical of labial-velar stops. , on the other hand, is fully voiced, as are the other voiced obstruents. Shryock et al. analyse the prenasalised stops as consonant clusters with . varies with , with some speakers using one, some the other, and some either, depending on the word.\n\nThe velar plosives & may be lenited to or between vowels.\n\nThe tap is pronounced as an approximant, , by some speakers.

The western part of the peninsula from the Tampa Bay area south, which was served mostly by GTE (now part of Verizon), was separated into area code 813 in 1953. As a result of the increase in the state's population, North Florida from the Panhandle to Jacksonville was assigned area code 904 with a permissive dialing period beginning July 6, 1965, and a mandatory dialing period beginning January 1, 1966.\n\nIn 1988, the east coast of Florida from Palm Beach County north through Brevard County, as well as the Orlando metropolitan area was assigned area code 407. In 1995, Broward County was split from 305 and assigned area code 954. Although this was intended to be a long-term solution, within two years the reconfigured area code 305 was already close to exhaustion due to explosive growth in South Florida, as well as the increasing popularity of cell phones and pagers. Available numbers were limited by the fact that Monroe County was split between two area codes, as well as the fact that all of South Florida from the Treasure Coast to the Keys is a single LATA. To solve this problem, area code 786 was installed as an overlay in 1998. The overlay originally only covered Miami-Dade County; the Keys were added in 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

Like many of Beckett's works, the piece was originally composed in French (\"Acte sans paroles II\"), then translated into English by Beckett himself. Written in the late 1950s it opened at the Calderon Press Institute in Oxford and was directed by John McGrath. London premiere was directed by Michael Horovitz and performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, on 25 January 1960. The first printing was in \"New Departures\" 1, Summer 1959.\n\nTwo sacks and a neat pile of clothes sit on a low, \"violently lit\" platform at the back of a stage. Both sacks contain a man; B is on the left, A on the right.\n\nA long pole (described in the text as a \"goad\") enters from the right, prods the sack containing A to awaken him to his daily routine, and then exits. After needing a second prod A finally emerges. He is unkempt and disorganised. He gobbles pills, prays, dresses randomly, nibbles a carrot, and promptly \"spits it out with disgust\". \"He is a moper, a hypochondriacal dreamer, perhaps a poet.\" His principal activity, without apparent purpose, is to carry the filled sack stage left and crawl back into his own which he does leaving the sack containing B now vulnerable to the goad.\n\nThe goad reappears, this time with a wheel attachment, and prods the other sack, exiting as before. B is precise, efficient and eager; he only requires a single prod to rouse him. The clothes he – presumably – folded neatly before are now scattered about (clear evidence of the existence of a third party) but he never reacts to this and simply goes about his business. He knows how to dress and take care of his clothes. He takes greater care of himself (brushing his teeth and exercising), is better organised (he checks his watch – eleven times in total – and consults a map and compass before setting off to move the sacks), but still his shift is no more meaningful. Even though he has more to do than A, Beckett instructs that B performs his chores briskly so that they should take approximately the same time as A’s. After moving the sacks he undresses and, rather than dumping his clothes in a pile, B folds them neatly before crawling into his own sack.\n\nThe goad appears for a third time (now requiring the support of two wheels) and attempts to wake A. Once again he needs two prods. He begins to replay his previous pantomime, but this time is cut off by a blackout, at which point the play ends.\n\nThe initial reviews ranged \"from puzzled to disapproving\" and the play fared little better in America but for all that Beckett wrote to Thomas MacGreevy: \"I have never had such good notices.\" Alan Schneider believed the problem was that \"[c]ritics can’t seem to comment on what’s before them without dragging in the older [plays] and rationalising their previous reactions.\"\n\nIn 2000, Patrice Parks wrote in \"Monterey County Weekly\" that \"Act Without Words II\" “has lost not an iota of relevance to today<nowiki>\"</nowiki>s mind-numbing workaday grind. If anything, Beckett<nowiki>\"</nowiki>s work has been vindicated with the passage of time.”\n\n\"The play is compelling only if the mechanical figures are somehow humanised. If comfort exists it is because the plight of humanity if futile or repetitive is at least shared, even if no intercourse exists.\" The two men work together to remove themselves from whatever external or elemental (see \"Mana\") force may be behind the goad; it counters by adding wheels. In time logic dictates they will reach a safe distance where they are beyond its reach but what then? Without it to motivate them, will they remain huddled in their sacks? Is that death?\n\nEugene Webb takes a different stance. He thinks that \"the goad, represent[s] man's inner compulsion to activity. If man cannot rely on anything outside himself, is there anything inside him, which might prove worthy of his hope and trust? What \"Act Without Words II\" has to say about this is that man is driven by a compulsive force that will never let him withdraw for long into inaction.\"\n\n\"The Unnamable\" famously ends with, \"I can’t go on, I’ll go on.\" The goad represents what happens in between these two phrases. There is some similarity between the characters A and B and the protagonists of Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\", Vladimir and Estragon who spend their time in much the same way, engaged in pointless tasks to amuse themselves and while away the time, though ultimately never leading to anything of significance. That said, B is more businessman-like, \"a kind of Pozzo … grotesquely efficient, a workaholic, a health nut.\" Between them they present \"a composite picture of man\": B is self-reliant and proactive, A prefers to trust in an external god.\n\n\"\"Act Without Words II\" shows that life must be endured, if not understood. There are no triumphs, no resolution … There is no control over the process, no\" seeing ‘the bigger picture’. \"[N]either A or B appears to realise that each one of them carries the other on his back [or that there even \"is\" an other] … they take their burden for granted\" as does Molloy, to cite a single example, who never questions how he has wound up in his mother’s room being paid for writing stuff that only gets returned the next week covered in proofreading markings. Indeed, A evokes the vagrant Molloy in the same way as B recalls the detective Moran.\n\nThe action could take place in a day or two or perhaps over the course of their whole lives. The movement to the left is suggestive however of \"the walk of Dante and Virgil in the \"Inferno\".\"\n\n\"In his reading of \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\" (\"The Myth of Sisyphus\") by Albert Camus, Beckett discovered a symbol for the futility, frustration and absurdity of all man's labours. Sisyphus – one of classical mythology's great sinners – suffered eternal punishment, having to perpetually roll a great stone to the top of a hill, only to see it roll back down again. Being born to enact and endure [an] eternal cycle of arousal-activity-rest, without any meaningful progress being achieved, is the sin that afflicts A-B.\"\n\nIn 1965 Paul Joyce made a poignant film of the play titled \"The Goad\" featuring Freddie Jones and Geoffrey Hinsliff. It was published in a limited edition (500 copies) of \"Nothing Doing in London\" [No. 1] (London: Anthony Barnett, 1966).\n\nNBC in America broadcast a version of \"Act without Words II\" in 1966, directed by Alan Schneider.\n\nIn the \"Beckett on Film\" project, the play was filmed as if it were a 1920s era black and white silent film.\n\nSince Beckett had instructed that \"the mime should be played on a low narrow platform at the back of [the] stage, violently lit in its entire length\" the director, Enda Hughes, chose, instead of a stage, to set the play \"on\" a strip of film being run through a movie projector. In place of a cut off by blackout, A's action is cut short by the projector being switched off. The action takes place across three frames thus complying with the \"[f]rieze effect\" Beckett sought.\n"}

Hickson was a year older than Neal. They first encountered each other at the drama department's Christmas show, in which Neal played a squirrel on a skateboard.\n\nIn a podcast, the pair recount how comedian Ben Elton taught Hickson Greek tragedy, and their Professor, David Mayer (father of Lise Mayer) introduced them to Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, who had been his students some years before. \"The Young Ones\" (written by Mayall, Lise Mayer and Ben Elton) was an early influence.\n\nNeal and Hickson initially performed as a trio together with Phil Dennison. They later appeared as a double act on the Manchester comedy circuit as Devilfishhornclub, performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1984, and promising “non-racist, non-sexist humour”.\n\nFollowing a suggestion by John Hegley, the duo were persuaded to relocate to London from Manchester. Later they were approached by a BBC producer for \"Saturday Superstore\" who \"said they were looking for a double act to represent the new style of comedy, but for children”.

A causeway connects it with the shore, making it a tied island. The rock is protected as the Morro Rock State Preserve.\n\nThe Morro Rock is one of 13 volcanic plugs (remnant necks of extinct volcanoes), lava domes, and sheetlike intrusions between Morro Bay on the north and Islay Hill on the south, all in San Luis Obispo County.\n\nIt is composed mostly of dacite, an igneous, volcanic rock, and partially of petrified bird feces, which have compacted into the plug over the years. It is a groundmass of plagioclase, with amphibole (hornblende), biotite, pyroxene (augite), quartz, and glass; phenocrysts of plagioclase, amphibole and often quartz. Its silica (SiO2) content can range from 63 to 69 percent.\n\nThe dacite volcanic plugs, lava domes, intrusive sheets, and felsitic rhyolite-dacite between Morro Rock and Islay Hill are part of the Mono Rock-Islay Hill Complex of the Oligocene epoch (from 27 to 23 million years ago). The complex lies east of the San Gregorio-San Simeon-Hosgri fault (the SG-SS-H fault). This complex is one of three probable sources of the volcanic clasts within the sandstone and conglomerate of the Miguelito and Edna members of the Pismo Formation in the Point Sur area 145–160 km (90-100 mi) to the north and west of the SG-SS-H fault. Based on paleomagnetic signatures, the Morro Rock-Islay Hill Complex was rotated 40 to 50 degrees, perhaps during late Miocene or early Pliocene time.\n\nThe Salinan and Chumash tribes consider Morro Rock to be a sacred site. The Salinan name for Morro Rock is \"Le'samo\" and the Chumash name is \"Lisamu\".\n\nThe Chumash had an important nearby prehistoric settlement at least as early as the Millingstone Horizon (6500-2000 B.C.E.), and the village was near the mouth of Morro Creek, at the current site of Morro Bay High School. The right of the Salinan people to climb Morro Rock for their biannual solstice ceremonies has been established, in which they celebrate the time in legend when a hawk and a raven destroyed a two-headed serpent-monster Taliyekatapelta as he wrapped his body around the base of the rock. The established Salinan right to climb the rock has been in legal dispute by the local Chumash tribe, which claims that Morro Rock is Chumash, not Salinan, territory. The Chumash also believe that the rock is so sacred that it should never be climbed. Because of its fragility, it is illegal for the general public to climb it.\n\nMorro Rock was probably seen by Spanish maritime explorers as early as 1542 under Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, but its current name was given during the first European land exploration of Alta California. The Spanish Portolá expedition came down Los Osos Valley and camped near today's Morro Bay on September 8, 1769. Franciscan missionary and expedition member Juan Crespí noted in his diary that \"we saw a great rock in the form of a round morro\".\n\nThe rock, which was quarried on and off from 1889 to 1969, provided material for the breakwater of Morro Bay and the improvements at Port San Luis Harbor. In 1966, a state law was adopted that transferred title to the State of California. In February 1968, the San Luis Obispo County Historical Society and the City of Morro Bay succeeded in having Morro Rock declared California Historical Landmark number 821.\n\nSeveral types of birds nest on Morro Rock, including three cormorant species and two gull species. It presently serves as a reserve for peregrine falcons, which are locally endangered and cause most of the laws that prohibit intervention with avian life.\n\nSea lions and sea otters can be seen regularly in the water around the rock. Seals, however, are much more common in the nearby Morro Bay State Park, where they breed.\n\nOther fauna include a wide selection of tide pool animals, like hermit crabs, small fish, starfish, sea cucumbers, mussels, bivalve mollusks, coral, and more.\n\nOn land few flora can survive the harsh, dry environment on the rock, but in the surrounding bay, kelp, sea grass, kelp forest plants, and tide pool plants can survive, and a few common grasses, mosses, lichens and weeds from the mainland take root on the rock itself.\n\nMorro Bay State Marine Recreational Management Area and Morro Bay State Marine Reserve are protected areas offshore from Morro Bay. Like underwater parks, areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\n\nIt was one of many local landmarks to be mentioned in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's 1978 song \"Take Me Down.\"\n\n\n"}

It also deals heavily with the relationship between the players on the team, especially the two main characters Kazuhiko Aikawa and Takumi Fujiwara.\n\nAt the outset of the manga, the Mizuho High School basketball team is in trouble, as there are not enough players to play a game. Additionally, the coach has left after a conflict with Fujiwara. However, Aikawa transfers to Mizuho and through his enthusiasm and sheer love of the game, infuses the few remaining members with a sense of purpose.\n\nDespite the fact that there are only five of them (i.e., they have no substitutes), they manage to get the coach of the girls' team to coach them as well. At first, she seems very strict, but later reveals her attachment to her \"Dear Boys\". Together, they do their best to make their dreams come true and take their team to the top of the prefecture.\n\nThe manga isn't only focused on the Mizuho team, but also on several rival teams. In fact, the manga artist spends a bit of time developing the characters of other teams' members.\n\n\nTwo video games were released.\n\nThe anime version of Dear Boys, also known as \"Hoop Days\", was released on TV in Japan in 2003. Like many Kodansha adaptations (e.g., \"Peach Girl\"), it was made on a rather low budget. As a result, it had somewhat lower quality animation than many other shōnen anime that came out in the same year.\n\nIt follows the storyline of the manga quite closely. Eurobeat music is played during the games, much like how the music genre is featured during the mountain pass races in Initial D.\n\nSince the company that produced \"Hoop Days\" also produced Initial D, they featured an episode of the cast watching scenes from the then-upcoming Initial D Fourth Stage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966753", "title": "Ecocentrism", "text": "Ecocentrism\n\nEcocentrism (; from Greek: οἶκος \"oikos\", \"house\" and κέντρον \"kentron\", \"center\") is a term used in ecological political philosophy to denote a nature-centered, as opposed to human-centered (i.e. anthropocentric), system of values. The justification for ecocentrism usually consists in an ontological belief and subsequent ethical claim. The ontological belief denies that there are any existential divisions between human and non-human nature sufficient to claim that humans are either (a) the sole bearers of intrinsic value or (b) possess greater intrinsic value than non-human nature. Thus the subsequent ethical claim is for an equality of intrinsic value across human and non-human nature, or 'biospherical egalitarianism'.\n\nAccording to Stan Rowe:\n\nand:\n\nThe ecocentric ethic was conceived by Aldo Leopold and recognizes that all species, including humans, are the product of a long evolutionary process and are inter-related in their life processes. The writings of Aldo Leopold and his idea of the land ethic and good environmental management are a key element to this philosophy.\nEcocentrism focuses on the biotic community as a whole and strives to maintain ecosystem composition and ecological processes. The term also finds expression in the first principle of the deep ecology movement, as formulated by Arne Næss and George Sessions in 1984\nwhich points out that anthropocentrism, which considers humans as the center of the universe and the pinnacle of all creation, is a difficult opponent for ecocentrism.\n\nEnvironmental thought and the various branches of the environmental movement are often classified into two intellectual camps: those that are considered anthropocentric, or \"human-centred,\" in orientation and those considered biocentric, or \"life-centred\". This division has been described in other terminology as \"shallow\" ecology versus \"deep\" ecology and as \"technocentrism\" versus \"ecocentrism\". Ecocentrism can be seen as one stream of thought within environmentalism, the political and ethical movement that seeks to protect and improve the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities by adopting environmentally benign forms of political, economic, and social organization and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature. In various ways, environmentalism claims that non-human organisms and the natural environment as a whole deserve consideration when appraising the morality of political, economic, and social policies.\n\nEcocentrism is taken by its proponents to constitute a radical challenge to long-standing and deeply rooted anthropocentric attitudes in Western culture, science, and politics. Anthropocentrism is alleged to leave the case for the protection of non-human nature subject to the demands of human utility, and thus never more than contingent on the demands of human welfare. An ecocentric ethic, by contrast, is believed to be necessary in order to develop a non-contingent basis for protecting the natural world. Critics of ecocentrism have argued that it opens the doors to an anti-humanist morality that risks sacrificing human well-being for the sake of an ill-defined ‘greater good’. Deep ecologist Arne Naess has identified anthropocentrism as a root cause of the ecological crisis, human overpopulation, and the extinctions of many non-human species. Lupinacci also points to anthropocentrism as a root cause of environmental degradation. Others point to the gradual historical realization that humans are not the centre of all things, that \"A few hundred years ago, with some reluctance, Western people admitted that the planets, Sun and stars did not circle around their abode. In short, our thoughts and concepts though irreducibly anthropomorphic need not be anthropocentric.\"\n\nIndustrocentrism is an ideology that goes hand in hand with today's industrial neoliberal capitalist agenda. It sees all things on earth as resources to be utilized by humans or to be commodified. This view is the opposite of anthropocentrism and ecocentrism. It negatively affects humans, nonhumans, and the environment in the long run in that it only focuses on short term economic gratification.\n\nEcocentrism is also contrasted with technocentrism (meaning values centred on technology) as two opposing perspectives on attitudes towards human technology and its ability to affect, control and even protect the environment. Ecocentrics, including \"deep green\" ecologists, see themselves as being subject to nature, rather than in control of it. They lack faith in modern technology and the bureaucracy attached to it. Ecocentrics will argue that the natural world should be respected for its processes and products, and that low impact technology and self-reliance is more desirable than technological control of nature.\nTechnocentrics, including imperialists, have absolute faith in technology and industry and firmly believe that humans have control over nature. Although technocentrics may accept that environmental problems do exist, they do not see them as problems to be solved by a reduction in industry. Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using science. Indeed, technocentrics see that the way forward for developed and developing countries and the solutions to our environmental problems today lie in scientific and technological advancement.\n\nThe distinction between biocentrism and ecocentrism is ill-defined. Ecocentrism recognizes Earth's interactive living and non-living systems rather than just the Earth's organisms (biocentrism) as central in importance.\nThe term has been used by those advocating \"left biocentrism\", combining deep ecology with an \"anti-industrial and anti-capitalist\" position (David Orton et al.).\n\n\n"}

The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that it had decided to accept de facto 17 August 1945 as Indonesia's independence date. However, on 14 September 2011, a Dutch court ruled in the Rawagede massacre case that the Dutch state was responsible because it had the duty to defend its inhabitants, which also indicated that the area was part of the Dutch East Indies, in contradiction of the Indonesian claim of 17 August 1945 as its date of independence.

The United Nations recognizes the date of 27 December 1949.\n\nThe document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name \"Soekarno\" using the Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice-president respectively the following day.\n\nThe date of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence was made a public holiday by a government decree issued on 18 June 1946., it's called Independence Day\n\nIn 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony. The Dutch colonial government was a centralist hierarchical system, where Indonesian representation was limited in the government. Resistance to Dutch rule was met with imprisonment and exile.\n\nThe fight for independence from the Netherlands included numerous people, and internal conflicts. It involved an Indonesian youth movement, where the youth were from varying class and educational backgrounds. It included figures such as Chaerul Saleh who was part of Menteng 31, which contained a diverse membership with different educational backgrounds. It also included Kaigun (Wikana) another figure part of the youth movement, who was a student of Sukarno. The fight for independence included a figure in the nationalist movement called Mohammad Hatta who worked to promote Indonesian interests. Another figure in the nationalist movement in Indonesian history was Sukarno, who established the Indonesian National Party in 1927, which advocated for independence from the Dutch. Hatta was educated at a Dutch university and Sukarno studied at the Bandung Institute of Technology where the study group he formed became the Indonesian National Party. Sukarno is known for many famous speeches and advocated for political independence. A speech given in June 1945 by Sukarno ‘Pancasila’ sets out the five principles of the foundation of the nation of Indonesia. In this speech he discusses the importance for political independence, with the first principle being nationalism and also the importance of religion to Indonesia in the principle of a belief in God.\n\nThe invasion by the Japanese in Indonesia added a new dynamic for the fight for independence. The Japanese defeated the Dutch in 1942 and moved into Indonesia, and this helped push the Dutch out and assisted towards the proclamation of independence. There were uprisings against the Japanese rule like the Dutch, where farmers and other workers were being exploited by the Japanese. Furthermore the Japanese had also tried to control Islam. Sukarno discusses in his speeches during the war that he believed independence could be achieved with the assistance of Japan. Hatta also worked with the Japanese, as he wanted to free Indonesian people from the Dutch. Hatta and Sjahrir another figure in the nationalist movement worked together towards independence for Indonesia. Where Hatta worked with the Japanese, Sjahrir focused on establishing an underground support network. Many educated youths influenced by Sjahrir in Jakarta and Bandung started establishing underground support networks for plans of Indonesian independence following Japan's defeat.\n\nThe end of the war on August 15 further expedited the process for independence. Youth leaders supported by Sjahrir hoped for a declaration of independence separate from the Japanese, which initially was not supported by Hatta and Sukarno. However with the assistance of a high ranking Japanese military officer Tadashi Maeda, the declaration of independence was drafted. Sukarno and Hatta on August 17, 1945 proclaimed independence, along with the youth leaders.\n\nThe draft was prepared only a few hours earlier on the night of 16 August 1945, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at the house of Rear-Admiral Tadashi Maeda, 1 . The house which is located in Jakarta is now the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum situated at Jl. Imam Bonjol No. 1. Aside from the three Indonesian leaders and Admiral Maeda, three Japanese agents were also present at the drafting: Tomegoro Yoshizumi (of the Navy Communications Office ); Shigetada Nishijima and Shunkichiro Miyoshi (of the Imperial Japanese Army). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of former Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August 1945.\n\nWhile the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945. The wording of the proclamation had been discussed at length and had to balance both conflicting internal Indonesian and Japanese interests. Sukarno drafted the final proclamation which balanced the interests of both the members of the youth movement and the Japanese. The term ‘TRANSFER OF POWER’ was used in Indonesian to satisfy Japanese interests to appear that it was an administrative transfer of power, although the term used ‘pemindahan kekuasaan’ could be perceived to mean political power. The wording ‘BY CAREFUL MEANS’ related to preventing conflict with members of the youth movement. The wording ‘IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME’ was used to meet the needs of all Indonesians for independence.\n\nThe historic event was triggered by internal conflict between the youth movement and other individuals working towards independence, where Adam Malik suggests a meeting had taken place which discussed proclaiming independence outside of Japan’s framework due to Japan’s surrender. It included figures from the youth movement such as Chaerul and Wikana, where Wikana in Sukarno’s house had encouraged Sukarno to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by the similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was strongly opposed down by the youth movement, who argued that the committee was too closely associated with the then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, members of the youth movement demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers, 'in the name of the people of Indonesia'.\n\nInitially the proclamation was to be announced at Djakarta central square, but the military had been sent to monitor the area, so the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.The proclamation was prevented from being broadcast on the radio to the outside world by Yamamoto and Nishimura from the Japanese military, and was also initially prevented from being reported in the newspapers. However Shigetada Nishijima and Tadashi Maeda enabled the proclamation to be dispersed via telephone and telegraph. The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the .The Domei news agency was used to send the text of the proclamation to reach Bandung and Jogjakarta. Members of the youth movement in Bandung facilitated broadcasts of the proclamation in Indonesian and English from radio Bandung. Furthermore the local radio system was connected with the Central Telegraph Office and it broadcast the proclamation overseas. Moreover Sukarno’s speech that he gave on the day of the proclamation was not fully published. During his speech he discusses the perseverance for the independence of Indonesia under Dutch and Japanese rule, and he states Indonesia being free from any other country.\n\nProklamasi\n\nKami, bangsa Indonesia, dengan ini menjatakan kemerdekaan Indonesia.\n\nHal jang mengenai pemindahan kekoeasaan d.l.l., diselenggarakan dengan tjara saksama dan dalam tempoh jang sesingkat-singkatnja\n\nDjakarta, 17-8-'05\n\nWakil Bangsa Indonesia \n\nNumerous figures who had been involved in the fight for independence had been working on a draft for the proclamation. Hatta had been working on a draft for the proclamation. Furthermore the youth movement had worked on and prepared a draft, however it was the final draft prepared by Sukarno that was used which balanced the interests of both the Indonesian and Japanese individuals that had been involved.\n\nP R O K L A M A S I\n\nKami, bangsa Indonesia, dengan ini menjatakan kemerdekaan Indonesia.\n\nHal-hal jang mengenai pemindahan kekoeasaan d.l.l., diselenggarakan dengan tjara saksama dan dalam \"tempo\" jang sesingkat-singkatnja.\n\n\"Djakarta, hari 17 boelan 8 tahoen 05\"\n\n\"Atas nama bangsa Indonesia,\"\n\nSoekarno/Hatta.\n\nAn English translation published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as of October 1948 included the entire speech as read by Sukarno. It incorporated remarks made immediately prior to and after the actual proclamation. George McTurnan Kahin, a historian on Indonesia, believed that they were omitted from publication in Indonesia either due to Japanese control of media outlets or fear of provoking a harsh Japanese response.\n\nPROCLAMATION\n\nWE THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA HEREBY DECLARE THE INDEPENDENCE OF\nINDONESIA. MATTERS WHICH CONCERN THE TRANSFER OF POWER E.T.C.\nWILL BE EXECUTED BY CAREFUL MEANS AND IN THE\nSHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME.\n\nDJAKARTA, 17 AUGUST 1945\n\nIN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA\n\nSOEKARNO/HATTA\n\nThis proclamation is printed on the front of the Rp.100,000 Indonesian banknote of the year 1999 and 2004 series.\n\nThe ramifications of the proclamation included moving ahead with the constitution.The Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia was approved on the 18th August 1945 which had been drafted earlier by the Investigating Committee. Due to the change in the political situation with Japan they removed segments related to Japan’s ideology. Furthermore the constitution promoted national unity due to Indonesia being a culturally diverse country. Islam was a popular religion and it also had a history that included numerous other religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. There were also individuals who also practiced Christianity. The constitution emphasized religious tolerance of religious minorities to prevent conflict. However this would lead to conflict with individuals including Sekar Madji Kartosuwiryo from Darul Islam located in West Java who believed it did not comply with Islam. Transitional regulations were added which permitted the PPKI to elect a president and vice president. A regulation also gave the president control and power over the constitution after the war for 6 months. Sukarno was elected as president and Hatta as vice-president. The constitution has since been substantially amended.\n\nAfter the proclamation there was a power vacuum which led to the Bersiap period, a violent and chaotic period.\n\nIndonesian youth played an important role in the proclamation, and the youth played a central role in the Indonesian National Revolution. One of the other changes that had also taken place during the Japanese occupation included the population in Indonesia undertaking military training. Conflict occurred not only with the Dutch, but also when the Japanese tried to re-establish control in October 1945 in Bandung, and furthermore when the British tried to establish control. The Dutch wanted to obtain some control again as it still had political and economic interests in Indonesia. After a long struggle for independence, the freedom of Indonesia from the Dutch in 1949 was part of a period of time of decolonization in Asia.\n\n"}

Film adaptations were released in 1943 and 1975.\n\nThe first part of the novel focuses on Colonel Haki, the dour but basically likable head of Turkish Security, who already made his first appearance in \"The Mask of Dimitrios\" and returns in later Ambler stories as a general.\n\nThe protagonist is a British engineer traveling back from Turkey, where he had completed high-level technical talks which could help cement a Turkish-British alliance in the recently started Second World War. German spies seek to assassinate him. Most of the plot takes place on board an Italian ship, where the protagonist travels in company with his nemesis - a German intellectual spymaster, accompanied by a Romanian hired killer - and with a rich cast of other characters, such as a Turkish secret agent, a Spanish courtesan and her pimp, and a French couple of which the husband is left-leaning and his wife is a staunch reactionary.\n\nAs common in Ambler's books, the protagonist is not a professional spy, and is clearly out of his depth. Indeed, the chief Nazi treats him with open contempt, which for much of the book seems amply justified. Yet ultimately the German professional pays dearly for underestimating this amateur - another plot element which was to be repeated in later Ambler books. The book came to be regarded as a classic among spy thrillers, setting out what became some of the genre's basic conventions and immensely influencing later works including the James Bond series.\n\nPart of the book's lasting charm is its capturing the atmosphere and mindset of the \"Phony War\" phase during which it was written: France is standing strong and nobody dreams that it would fall within a few months, the Italians are strictly neutral and there is no suggestion that they are about to ally with Germany against Britain, and so on. From the book it seems that Ambler—like many Britons at the time of writing—expected the war to be more or less a replay of the First World War.\n\nA 1943 film adaptation starred Joseph Cotten, with Orson Welles acting and producing. In 1975, Daniel Mann remade \"Journey Into Fear\" with Sam Waterston and Vincent Price. The film was the first major Hollywood production to be filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2001, a Vancouver-based artist, Stan Douglas, remade the movie as a film installation with a recombinant soundtrack.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966797", "title": "ID3 algorithm", "text": "ID3 algorithm\n\nIn decision tree learning, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm invented by Ross Quinlan used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.\n\nThe ID3 algorithm begins with the original set formula_1 as the root node. On each iteration of the algorithm, it iterates through every unused attribute of the set formula_1 and calculates the entropy formula_3 or the information gain formula_4 of that attribute. It then selects the attribute which has the smallest entropy (or largest information gain) value. The set formula_1 is then split or partitioned by the selected attribute to produce subsets of the data. (For example, a node can be split into child nodes based upon the subsets of the population whose ages are less than 50, between 50 and 100, and greater than 100.) The algorithm continues to recurse on each subset, considering only attributes never selected before.\n\nRecursion on a subset may stop in one of these cases:\n\n\nThroughout the algorithm, the decision tree is constructed with each non-terminal node (internal node) representing the selected attribute on which the data was split, and terminal nodes (leaf nodes) representing the class label of the final subset of this branch.\n\n\n ID3 (Examples, Target_Attribute, Attributes)\n\nID3 does not guarantee an optimal solution. It can converge upon local optima. It uses a greedy strategy by selecting the locally best attribute to split the dataset on each iteration. The algorithm's optimality can be improved by using backtracking during the search for the optimal decision tree at the cost of possibly taking longer.\n\nID3 can overfit the training data. To avoid overfitting, smaller decision trees should be preferred over larger ones. This algorithm usually produces small trees, but it does not always produce the smallest possible decision tree.\n\nID3 is harder to use on continuous data than on factored data (factored data has a discrete number of possible values, thus reducing the possible branch points). If the values of any given attribute are continuous, then there are many more places to split the data on this attribute, and searching for the best value to split by can be time consuming.\n\nThe ID3 algorithm is used by training on a data set formula_1 to produce a decision tree which is stored in memory. At runtime, this decision tree is used to classify new test cases (feature vectors) by traversing the decision tree using the features of the datum to arrive at a leaf node. The class of this terminal node is the class the test case is classified as.\n\nEntropy formula_3 is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in the (data) set formula_1 (i.e. entropy characterizes the (data) set formula_1).\n\nWhere,\n\nWhen formula_20, the set formula_1 is perfectly classified (i.e. all elements in formula_1 are of the same class).\n\nIn ID3, entropy is calculated for each remaining attribute. The attribute with the smallest entropy is used to split the set formula_1 on this iteration. Entropy in information theory measures how much information is expected to be gained upon measuring a random variable; as such, it can also be used to quantify the amount to which the distribution of the quantity's values is unknown. A constant quantity has zero entropy, as its distribution is perfectly known. In contrast, a uniformly distributed random variable (discretely or continuously uniform) maximizes entropy. Therefore, the greater the entropy at a node, the less information is known about the classification of data at this stage of the tree; and therefore, the greater the potential to improve the classification here.\n\nAs such, ID3 is a greedy heuristic performing a best-first search for locally optimal entropy values. Its accuracy can be improved by preprocessing the data.\n\nInformation gain formula_24 is the measure of the difference in entropy from before to after the set formula_1 is split on an attribute formula_26. In other words, how much uncertainty in formula_1 was reduced after splitting set formula_1 on attribute formula_26.\n\nWhere,\n\nIn ID3, information gain can be calculated (instead of entropy) for each remaining attribute. The attribute with the largest information gain is used to split the set formula_1 on this iteration.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966799", "title": "Permanent Settlement", "text": "Permanent Settlement\n\nThe Permanent Settlement, also known as the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was an agreement between the East India Company and Bengali landlords to fix revenues to be raised from land that had far-reaching consequences for both agricultural methods and productivity in the entire British Empire and the political realities of the Indian countryside. It was concluded in 1793 by the Company administration headed by Charles, Earl Cornwallis. It formed one part of a larger body of legislation, known as the Cornwallis Code. The Cornwallis Code of 1793 divided the East India Company's service personnel into three branches: revenue, judicial, and commercial. Revenues were collected by \"zamindars\", native Indians who were treated as landowners. This division created an Indian landed class that supported British authority.\n\nThe Permanent Settlement was introduced first in Bengal and Bihar and later in the south district of Madras and Varanasi. The system eventually spread all over northern India by a series of regulations dated 1 May 1793. These regulations remained in place until the Charter Act of 1833. The other two systems prevalent in India were the Ryotwari System and the Mahalwari System. \n\nMany argue that the settlement and its outcome had several shortcomings when compared with its initial goals of increasing tax revenue, creating a Western-European style land market in Bengal, and encouraging investment in land and agriculture, thereby creating the conditions for long-term economic growth for both the company and region's inhabitants. Firstly, the policy of fixing the rate of expected tax revenue for the foreseeable future meant that the income of the Company from taxation actually decreased in the long-term because revenues remained fixed while expenses increased over time. Meanwhile, the condition of the Bengali peasantry became increasingly pitiable, with famines becoming a regular occurrence as landlords (who risked immediate loss of their land if they failed to deliver the expected amount from taxation) sought to guarantee revenue by coercing the local agriculturalists to cultivate cash crops such as cotton, indigo, and jute, while long-term private investment by the zamindars in agricultural infrastructure failed to materialise.\n\nEarlier \"zamindars\" in Bengal, Bihar and Odisha had been functionaries who held the right to collect revenue on behalf of the Mughal emperor and his representative, the \"diwan\", in Bengal. The diwan supervised the zamindars to ensure they were neither lax nor overly stringent. When the East India Company was awarded the diwani or overlordship of Bengal by the empire following the Battle of Buxar in 1764, it found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law. As a result, landholders were unsupervised or reported to corrupt and indolent officials. The result was that revenues were extracted without regard for future income or local welfare.\n\nFollowing the devastating famine of 1770, which was partially caused by this shortsightedness, Company officials in Calcutta better understood the importance of oversight of revenue officials. Warren Hastings, then governor-general, introduced a system of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farmers. They did not want to take direct control of local administration in villages for several reasons, including that Company did not want to annoy those people who had traditionally enjoyed power and prestige in rural Bengal. \n\nThe Company failed to consider the question of incentivisation. Many appointed tax farmers absconded with as much revenue as they could during the time period between inspections. The British Parliament took note of the disastrous consequences of the system, and in 1784, British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger directed the Calcutta administration to alter it immediately. In 1786 Charles Cornwallis was sent out to India to reform the company's practices.\n\nIn 1786, the East India Company Court of Directors first proposed a permanent settlement for Bengal, changing the policy then being followed by Calcutta, which was attempting to increase taxation of \"zamindars\". Between 1786 and 1790, the new Governor-General Lord Cornwallis and Sir John Shore (later Governor-General) entered a heated debate over whether or not to introduce a permanent settlement with the \"zamindars\". Shore argued that the native \"zamindars\" would not trust the permanent settlement to be permanent and that it would take time before they realised it was genuine.\n\nThe main aim of the Permanent Settlement was to resolve the problem of agrarian crisis and distress that had resulted in lower agricultural output. The British officials thought that investment in agriculture, trade, and the resources of the revenue of the State could be increased by agriculture. For this, permanently fixing the revenue and securing the rights of property was done- a system came to be known as the 'Permanent Settlement'. The British thought that once the revenue demands of the State were permanently set, there would be a regular flow of tax income. Furthermore, landholders would invest in their agricultural land as the producer can keep surpluses in excess of the fixed tax. The British officials thought that such a process would lead to the emergence of yeomen class of farmers and rich landowners who would invest their capital to generate further surpluses. This new emergent class would be loyal to the British, who were still gaining a foothold in the Indian subcontinent. While the policy was well-intentioned, it failed to identify individuals who were willing to contract to pay fixed revenue perpetually and to invest in the improvement of agriculture. After much discussion and disagreement between the officials, the Permanent Settlement was made with the existing Rajas and Taluqdars of Bengal who were now classified as Zamindars. They had to pay fixed revenue in perpetuity. Thus, zamindars were not the landowners but rather revenue collector agents of the State. Cornwallis believed that they would immediately accept it and so begin investing in improving their land. In 1790, the Court of Directors issued a ten-year (decennial) settlement to the \"zamindars\", which was made permanent in 1793.\n\nBy the Permanent Settlement Act of 1793, their power of keeping the armed forces were taken back. They remained just the tax collectors of the land. There were considerably weakened as they were now banned from holding any court, as it was brought under the supervision of collector appointed by the company. British officials believed that investing in the land would improve the economy.\n\nThe system failed in the long run due to operational difficulty as well as because the Permanent Settlement did not take account of the seasonal and precarious nature of Bengali agriculture. The Company also did not understand the structural issues as well as the society. \n\nThe question of incentivisation now being understood to be central, the security of tenure of landlords was guaranteed. In short, the former landholders and revenue intermediaries were granted proprietorial rights (effective ownership) to the land they held. Smallholders were no longer permitted to sell their land, but they could not be expropriated by their new landlords.\n\nIncentivisation of zamindars was intended to encourage improvements of the land, such as drainage, irrigation and the construction of roads and bridges; such infrastructure had been insufficient through much of Bengal. With a fixed land tax, zamindars could securely invest in increasing their income without any fear of having the increase taxed away by the Company. Cornwallis made the motivation quite clear by declaring that \"when the demand of government is fixed, an opportunity is afforded to the landholder of increasing his profits, by the improvement of his lands\". The British had in mind \"improving landlords\" in their own country, such as Coke of Norfolk.\n\nThe Court of Directors also hoped to guarantee the company's income, which was constantly plagued by defaulting zamindars who fell into arrears, making it impossible for them to budget their spending accurately.\n\nThe immediate consequence of the Permanent Settlement was both very sudden and dramatic, one that nobody had apparently foreseen. By ensuring that zamindars' lands were held in perpetuity and with a fixed tax burden, they became desirable commodities. In addition, the government tax demand was inflexible, and the British East India Company's collectors refused to make allowances for times of drought, flood or other natural disaster. The tax demand was higher than that in England at the time. As a result, many zamindars immediately fell into arrears.\n\nThe Company's policy of auction of any zamindari lands deemed to be in arrears created a market for land that previously did not exist. Many of the new purchasers of this land were Indian officials within the East India Company's government. The bureaucrats were ideally placed to purchase lands which they knew to be underassessed and therefore profitable. In addition, their position as officials gave them opportunity to acquire the wealth necessary to purchase land. They could also manipulate the system to bring to sale land that they specifically wanted.\n\nHistorian Bernard S. Cohn and others have argued that the Permanent Settlement led to a commercialisation of land that previously did not exist in Bengal and, as a consequence, it led to a change in the social background of the ruling class from \"lineages and local chiefs\" to \"under civil servants and their descendants, and to merchants and bankers\". The new landlords were different in their outlook; \"often they were absentee landlords who managed their land through managers and who had little attachment to their land\".\n\nThe Company hoped that the Zamindar class would not only be a revenue-generating instrument but also serve as intermediaries for the more political aspects of their rule, preserving local custom and protecting rural life from the possibly rapacious influences of its own representatives. However, it worked both ways, as zamindars became a naturally conservative interest group. Once British policy in the mid-19th century changed to one of reform and intervention in custom, the zamindars were vocal in their opposition. The Permanent Settlement had the features that state demand was fixed at 89% of the rent and 11% was to be retained by the zamindar. The state demand could not be increased but payment should be made on the due date, before sunset, so it was also known as the 'Sunset Law'. Failure to pay led to the sale of land to the highest bidder.\n\nWhile the worst of the tax-farming excesses were countered by the introduction of the Settlement, the use of land was not part of the agreement. There was a tendency of Company officials and Indian landlords to force their tenants into plantation-style farming of cash crops like indigo and cotton rather than rice and wheat. That was a cause of many of the worst famines of the nineteenth century. \n\nOnce the salient features of the Permanent Settlement were reproduced all over India, and indeed elsewhere in the Empire, including Kenya, the political structure was altered forever. The landlord class held much greater power than they had under the Mughals, who subjected them to oversight by a trained bureaucracy with the power to attenuate their tenure. The power of the landlord caste/class over smallholders was not diluted in India until the first efforts towards land reform in the 1950s, still incomplete everywhere except West Bengal.\n\nIn Pakistan, where land reform was never carried out, elections in rural areas still suffer from a tendency towards oligarchy, reflecting the concentration of influence in the hands of zamindar families. This is because once Pakistan became separated from India, and the two began to fight over Kashmir, the goal of the government was revenue extraction to fund the military. As a result, the central leadership skewed the relationship between the elected and non-elected institutions of the state.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966809", "title": "Too Much Johnson", "text": "Too Much Johnson\n\nToo Much Johnson is a 1938 American silent comedy film written and directed by Orson Welles. An unfinished film component of a stage production, the film was made three years before Welles directed \"Citizen Kane\", but it was never publicly screened. The film was shot to be integrated into Welles's Mercury Theatre stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy, but the motion picture sequences could not be shown due to the absence of projection facilities at the venue, the Stony Creek Theatre in Connecticut. The resulting plot confusion reportedly contributed to the stage production's failure.\n\nThe film was believed to be lost, but in 2013 a print was discovered in a warehouse in Pordenone, Italy. The film premiered on October 9, 2013, at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. In 2014, the work print and a modern edit of the film were made available online by the National Film Preservation Foundation.\n\nTwo previous films had been made of this play, a short film in 1900 and a feature-length Paramount film in 1919 starring Lois Wilson and Bryant Washburn. Both of these films are now lost.\n\n\nThe film was not intended to stand by itself, but was designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury Theatre stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy about a New York playboy who flees from the violent husband of his mistress and borrows the identity of a plantation owner in Cuba who is expecting the arrival of a mail-order bride.\n\nWelles planned to mix live action and film for this production. The film was designed to run 40 minutes, with 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute introductions for the second and third act. Welles planned to create a silent film in the tradition of the Mack Sennett slapstick comedies, in order to enhance the various chases, duels and comic conflicts of the Gillette play.\n\n\"The multi-media concept was a throwback to the early age of cinema when vaudeville shows were punctuated by quick cinematic vignettes,\" wrote Welles biographer Bret Wood. The alternation format stage-and-screen hybrid—scenes of live performance linked together by film segments—dates back to 1896.\n\nWelles thought highly of Joseph Cotten as a comic actor, and cast him as the lead in the farce. Other Mercury Theatre actors included Ruth Ford, Arlene Francis, Howard Smith, Mary Wickes and Eustace Wyatt. Welles's wife, Virginia Nicolson, appeared in the film under her professional pseudonym Anna Stafford. Bit parts were given to Welles's Mercury Theatre producer John Houseman, assistant director John Berry, composer Marc Blitzstein, and Herbert Drake, the \"New York Herald Tribune\" drama reporter who became the Mercury Theatre's publicist and, later, vice president. Although writer Frank Brady reported that Welles gave himself a small role as a Keystone Kop, Welles is not seen in the film. Among the uncredited extras for a crowd sequence was a young Judy Holliday.\n\nHarry Dunham, a newsreel and documentary cameraman who was an old friend of Paul Bowles, was the film's cinematographer. Location photography took place in New York City's Battery Park and Central Park. Additional shooting took place on a Hudson River day-trip excursion boat and at locations in Yonkers, New York, and Haverstraw, New York. Interior shots were set up at a studio in the Bronx, New York. For the Cuban plantation, Welles created a miniature structure next to a papier-mâché volcano, with store-bought tropical plants to suggest the exotic Caribbean flora.\n\nWelles and his crew spent ten days shooting \"Too Much Johnson\", which resulted in approximately 25,000 feet of film. He edited the footage on a Moviola in his suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, and John Houseman later recalled visitors had to \"wade knee-deep through a crackling sea of flammable [nitrate] film.\"\n\nWelles was assisted by John Berry, who had been hired by the Mercury Theatre as an apprentice and extra for \"Caesar\" and worked with Welles on subsequent Mercury productions, including \"Too Much Johnson\". Years later he recalled building the sets on a vacant lot in Yonkers, and organizing a crew that literally held them up against in the wind during filming.\n\n\"Orson had a wonderful time making the film,\" Berry said, reporting that Welles was so absorbed in the cutting that he took little note when the film caught fire in the projector. \"What I remember, most remarkably, is me running with the projector in my hand, burning, trying to get out of the door into the goddamn hallway, and Houseman racing for the door at the same time … while Orson, with absolutely no concern whatsoever, was back inside, standing and looking at some piece of film in his hand, smoking his pipe.\n\nDuring post-production, Welles ran into financial problems relating to his cast (who were not originally paid for the film shoot) and the film laboratory, which refused to deliver the processed film until it received payment. Welles also received an attorney's letter from Paramount Pictures informing him that the studio owned the film rights to \"Too Much Johnson\", and that public presentation of his film would require payment to the studio.\n\nWelles initially planned to present the stage-and-film mix of \"Too Much Johnson\" at the Stony Creek Theatre in Connecticut as a pre-Broadway trial run, but discovered that the theater's ceiling was too low to allow for film projection. The show opened on August 16, 1938, without the filmed sequences. Most modern sources report that audience and critical reaction to the show was poor and caused Welles to abandon the production, but a search of press coverage at the time indicates no negative published reports and no reviews from major critics. \"The Branford Review\" reported that interest in the stage production was strong as it began its second week.\n\nWelles never completed editing the film component for \"Too Much Johnson\" and put the footage in storage. He rediscovered it three decades later at his home outside of Madrid, Spain. \"I can't remember whether I had it all along and dug it out of the bottom of a trunk, or whether someone brought it to me, but there it was\", he later recalled. \"I screened it, and it was in perfect condition, with not a scratch on it, as though it had only been through a projector once or twice before. It had a fine quality.\" Welles, however, never allowed the footage to be seen publicly, stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the Gillette play. In August 1970, a fire broke out at Welles's villa and the only known complete print of \"Too Much Johnson\" was destroyed.\n\nA copy was discovered in Italy in 2008, and on August 5, 2013, the George Eastman House museum of film and photography in the U.S. announced that it had completed a long process of restoration together with \"Cinemazero\", the National Film Preservation Foundation, and laboratory experts in the U.S. and the Netherlands. Cinema Arts, a Pennsylvania film laboratory, performed most of the preservation work. \"The next step was to begin the actual photo-chemical preservation\", said Tony Delgrosso, Head of Preservation at George Eastman House. \"For that we turned to a lab called Cinema Arts who are world famous for the quality of their black-and-white photo-chemical preservation and restoration.\"\n\n\"Too Much Johnson\" premiered October 9, 2013, at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. The film's North American premiere was held October 16, 2013, at George Eastman House's Dryden Theatre, and the film's New York City premiere took place on November 25, 2013, at the Directors Guild of America Theater.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, the complete 66-minute work print of the film was posted online by the National Film Preservation Foundation. An edited version running about 34 minutes including intertitles, with new music composed and performed by Michael Mortilla, was also made available. \"If this edit is only a guess, it strives to be an educated one,\" stated the foundation, \"informed by research into the unpublished play scripts left behind by Welles and the Mercury Theatre company.\"\n\nOn February 5, 2015, \"Too Much Johnson\" was screened and performed for the very first time as a complete stage performance at the Film Forum in New York City, in association with George Eastman House, as Welles originally intended. The filmed portions were shown as prologues to the play's three acts which were performed as a staged reading by the Film Forum Players. The staged reading was directed by Allen Lewis Rickman, who adapted the play from both the Welles and Gillette versions. It was produced by Bruce Goldstein. Steve Sterner composed and performed the soundtrack for the film. The footage was re-edited by William Hohauser to fit a coherent narrative structure in conjunction with the play. Sequences already edited by Welles were left intact.\n\nDemand to see \"Too Much Johnson\" at its world premiere at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival warranted two additional showings. Reporting the \"snaking queues outside the auditorium\", \"The Guardian\" described the film as \"a gleeful experiment in silent cinema pastiche\":\nAnd while it is a work print, not a finished film, \"Too Much Johnson\" offers breathlessly enjoyable viewing. Joseph Cotten makes a tremendous movie debut as the play's philandering lead, displaying unimagined guts and agility in a series of tumbles and leaps across Manhattan rooftops, pursued by a prancing, moustache-twirling Edgar Barrier. And \"Too Much Johnson\" is itself an affectionate romp through Keystone two-reelers, Harold Lloyd's stunt slapstick, European serials, Soviet montage and, notably, Welles's favoured steep expressionist-influenced camera angles.\n\n\"Variety\" called the unedited footage \"an unanticipated delight\":\n\nThere are moments of ultra-broad comedy — Arlene Francis, looking ravishing, hams it up with evident delight at the start — yet the outdoor footage, much of it shot in the Meatpacking District and further south, is a delightful spin on slapstick chase conventions, and a dashing Joseph Cotten, in Harold Lloyd mode, demonstrates a remarkable lack of vertigo along with physical grace. Genuinely funny rather than derivative, the film as seen, complete with multiple takes, feels fresh and spirited up until the last section, when scenes meant to take place in Cuba (but shot near the Hudson, with a few rented palm trees) lose a bit of steam before the amusing final shots.\n\nWriting for \"Bright Lights Film Journal\", film historian Joseph McBride categorizes \"Too Much Johnson\" as Welles's pre-Hollywood filmmaking experiment,\n\na youthful tribute not only to the spirited tradition of exuberant low comedy but also to the past of the medium he was about to enter. Welles was always enamored of the past, though more, he said, of the mythical past we prefer to revere in fantasy than the actual messy past that was, e.g., “Merrie Old England” and “Camelot” rather than the real England of those days. He explores that theme in deeply personal ways in \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and \"Chimes at Midnight\", and \"Too Much Johnson\" is also reflective of his obsession with bygone times, cultural mores, and means of expression.\n\n\n"}

C4.5 is an extension of Quinlan's earlier ID3 algorithm. The decision trees generated by C4.5 can be used for classification, and for this reason, C4.5 is often referred to as a statistical classifier. In 2011, authors of the Weka machine learning software described the C4.5 algorithm as \"a landmark decision tree program that is probably the machine learning workhorse most widely used in practice to date\".\n\nIt became quite popular after ranking #1 in the \"Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining\" pre-eminent paper published by Springer LNCS in 2008.\n\nC4.5 builds decision trees from a set of training data in the same way as ID3, using the concept of information entropy. The training data is a set formula_1 of already classified samples. Each sample formula_2 consists of a p-dimensional vector formula_3, where the formula_4 represent attribute values or features of the sample, as well as the class in which formula_5 falls.\n\nAt each node of the tree, C4.5 chooses the attribute of the data that most effectively splits its set of samples into subsets enriched in one class or the other. The splitting criterion is the normalized information gain (difference in entropy). The attribute with the highest normalized information gain is chosen to make the decision.

It may be negative. Through Growth planning, businesses are able to achieve organic growth by selecting the best strategies available to them. For example, by examining Ansoff's matrix, businesses can select from market penetration, market development, product development and diversification to grow their revenue organically.\n\nOrganic business growth does include growth over a period that results from investment in businesses the company owned at the beginning of the period. What it excludes is the boost to growth from acquisitions, and the decline from sales and closures of whole businesses.\n\nWhen a company does not disclose organic growth numbers, it is usually possible to estimate them by estimating the numbers for acquisitions made in the period being looked at and in the previous year. It is useful to break down organic sales growth into that coming from market growth and that coming from gains in market share: this makes it easier to see how sustainable growth is.\n\nRelating to organic input in an organisation, it can also relate to the act of closing down cost centers through established organic methods instead of waiting for a Finance list.\n\nThe mechanisms and rate of growth of firms experiencing organic growth was extensively studied by Edith Penrose in her 1958 book \"The Theory of the Growth of the Firm\".\n\nAn early reference to \"organic growth\" appeared in Inazo Nitobe's 1899 book .\n\nOrganic Growth is evolving to a new concept within the social media marketing of the 21st century.

{"id": "1966825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966825", "title": "Macbeth (1948 film)", "text": "Macbeth (1948 film)\n\nMacbeth is a 1948 American historical drama war film adaptation by Orson Welles of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Macbeth\", with Welles in the lead role. Jeanette Nolan co-stars as Lady Macbeth.\n\nIn 1947, Orson Welles began promoting the notion of bringing a Shakespeare drama to the motion picture screen. He initially attempted to pique Alexander Korda's interest in an adaptation of \"Othello\", but was unable to gather support for the project. Welles switched to pushing for a film adaptation of \"Macbeth\", which he visualized in its violent setting as \"a perfect cross between \"Wuthering Heights\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\".\"\n\nTeaming with producer Charles K. Feldman, Welles successfully convinced Herbert Yates, founder and president of Republic Pictures, of the prospect of creating a film version of \"Macbeth\". Yates was attempting to raise the level of his studio, which produced Roy Rogers Westerns and low-budget features, into that of a prestige studio. Republic had already tried to present off-beat features, including Gustav Machatý's \"Jealousy\" (1945) and Ben Hecht's \"Specter of the Rose\" (1946).\n\nHowever, Yates was not able to provide Welles with a large budget. Welles guaranteed to deliver a completed negative of \"Macbeth\" on a budget of $700,000. When some members of the Republic board of directors expressed misgivings on the project, Welles had a contract drawn in which he agreed to personally pay any amount over $700,000.\n\nWelles had previously staged the so-called \"Voodoo Macbeth\" in 1936 in New York City with an all-black cast, and again in 1947 in Salt Lake City as part of the Utah Centennial Festival. He borrowed aspects from both productions for his film adaptation.\n\n\"Macbeth\" marked the fourth time that a post-silent era Hollywood studio produced a film based on a Shakespeare play: United Artists had produced \"The Taming of the Shrew\" in 1929, Warner Brothers made \"A Midsummer Night’s Dream\" in 1935, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced \"Romeo and Juliet\" in 1936. None of these films was commercially successful, but the commercial and critical prestige earned by Laurence Olivier's film version of \"Henry V\" (which was produced in Great Britain in 1944 but not seen in the U.S. until 1946) helped to propel Welles' \"Macbeth\" forward.\nWelles cast himself in the title role, but was initially stymied in casting Lady Macbeth, regarded by Republic as the focus of the film. His first choice was Vivien Leigh, but Welles never approached her since he believed her husband, Laurence Olivier, would be unsupportive. The role was offered to Tallulah Bankhead, who turned it down. At Welles's request Anne Baxter, Mercedes McCambridge and Agnes Moorehead were approached but they were unavailable. \"There is no evidence to suggest that these rejections were much of a blow to Welles,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. Welles settled on Jeanette Nolan, one of the Mercury Theatre's repertory players on radio and a trusted colleague since their days on \"The March of Time\" radio program.\n\nWelles brought in Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy in his first U.S. film role as Macduff, and cast former child star Roddy McDowall as Malcolm. Welles also cast his daughter Christopher in the role of Macduff's son; this was her only film appearance.\n\nThe cast of \"Macbeth\" is listed in the \"AFI Catalog of Feature Films\".\nIn bringing \"Macbeth\" to the screen, Welles made several changes to Shakespeare's original. He added sequences involving the witches to increase their significance. At the beginning of the film, they create a clay figurine of Macbeth, which is used to symbolize his rise and ruin. It collapses in a heap, seemingly of its own volition, immediately after Macbeth is beheaded. The witches seem to cast a spell on the doll, and anything that happens to it seems to happen also to Macbeth, as in voodoo. The witches also return at the end of the film, viewing the drama from afar and uttering \"Peace, the charm's wound up\" as the final line; this line is spoken in the first act in the original text, when the witches initially confront Macbeth.\n\nBecause of censorship, the Porter's speech was shorn of all its \"double entendre\".\n\nA major change is Welles' introduction of a new character, the Holy Man. The priest recites the prayer of Saint Michael. Welles later explained that the character's presence was meant to confirm that \"the main point of that production is the struggle between the old and new religions. I saw the witches as representatives of a Druidical pagan religion suppressed by Christianity – itself a new arrival.\" There is a subtle insinuation that Lady Macbeth fatally stabs Duncan prior to Macbeth's attack on the king, and Macbeth is witness to Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking and madness scene; in the play, he is not present.\n\nOther changes were made to make the play more cinematic. Nearly all of King Duncan's scenes at the beginning of the play have been cut as well as the character of Donalbain, his second son. Macbeth is seen dictating his letter to his wife, rather than writing it himself. In the play, no such dictation scene exists. The Thane of Cawdor's execution takes place on-screen accompanied by insistent drumbeats. Lady Macbeth's suicide and the final battle between Macbeth's forces and Macduff's army are depicted on-screen; in the play, both scenes occur off-stage. Rather than fatally stabbing Macbeth and then beheading the dead body, Macduff kills Macbeth by slashing off his head. Needless to say, lines have been cut, speeches have been reassigned, scenes have been reordered, etc. This scandalized many critics at the time; today it is accepted practice to do so in film versions of Shakespeare plays to an even greater degree than Welles did, as Jean-Luc Godard did in his highly unusual and controversial \"King Lear\", and as Peter Greenaway did in \"Prospero's Books\".\n\nThe film was shot on leftover sets for the westerns that were normally made at Republic Studios. In order to accommodate the tight production schedule, Welles had the \"Macbeth\" cast pre-record their dialogue.\n\nWelles later expressed frustration with the film's low budget trappings. Most of the costumes were rented from Western Costume, except those for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. \"Mine should have been sent back, because I looked like the Statue of Liberty in it,\" Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. \"But there was no dough for another and nothing in stock at Western would fit me, so I was stuck with it.\"\n\nWelles also told Bogdanovich that the scene he felt was most effective was actually based on hunger. \"Our best crowd scene was a shot where all the massed forces of Macduff's army are charging the castle\", he said. \"There was a very vivid urgency to it, because what was happening, really, was that we'd just called noon break, and all those extras were rushing off to lunch.\"\n\nWelles shot \"Macbeth\" in 23 days, with one day devoted to retakes.\n\nRepublic initially planned to have \"Macbeth\" in release by December 1947, but Welles was not ready with the film. The studio entered the film in the 1948 Venice Film Festival, but it was abruptly withdrawn when it was compared unfavorably against Olivier's version of \"Hamlet\", which was also in the festival's competition.\n\nIn the U.S. theatrical release, Republic tested the film in a few cities. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with complaints about Welles's decision to have his cast speak in Scottish burrs and modify the original text.\n\nAfter its original release, Republic had Welles cut two reels from the film and ordered him to have much of the soundtrack re-recorded with the actors speaking in their natural voices, and not the approximation of Scottish accents that Welles initially requested. This new version was released by Republic in 1950. While critical reaction was still not supportive, the film earned a small profit for the studio.\n\nWelles would maintain mixed emotions about \"Macbeth\". In a 1953 lecture at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, he said: \"My purpose in making \"Macbeth\" was not to make a great film – and this is unusual, because I think that every film director, even when he is making nonsense, should have as his purpose the making of a great film. I thought I was making what might be a good film, and what, if the 23-day day shoot schedule came off, might encourage other filmmakers to tackle difficult subjects at greater speed. Unfortunately, not one critic in any part of the world chose to compliment me on the speed. They thought it was a scandal that it should only take 23 days. Of course, they were right, but I could not write to every one of them and explain that no one would give me any money for a further day's shooting . . . However, I am not ashamed of the limitations of the picture.\"\n\nThe truncated version of \"Macbeth\" remained in release until 1980, when the original uncut version with the Scottish-tinged soundtrack was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Folger Shakespeare Library. Critical opinion of the film has drastically improved since its original release, with many now regarding it as one of Welles' most notable films. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 7.52/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \"This haunting, eccentric \"Macbeth\" may be hampered by budget constraints, but Orson Welles delivers both behind and in front of the camera.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966829", "title": "Area code 404", "text": "Area code 404\n\nArea code 404 of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) identifies a numbering plan area (NPA) that covers Atlanta, Georgia, and its closest suburbs: roughly the area encircled by Interstate 285. It is an enclave area code, completely surrounded by area code 770, which serves most of Atlanta's suburbs. Both 404 and 770 are overlaid by area codes 678 and 470.\n\nArea code 404 was created in 1947 as one the original numbering plan areas in North America. It originally served the entire state of Georgia. On July 1, 1954, the southern portion of the state, everything from Macon southward, was split off as area code 912. Area code 404 served the northern half of the state, from the Tennessee and North Carolina borders as far south as Columbus and Augusta.\n\nDespite Atlanta's growth in the 1970s and 1980s, 404 remained unchanged for 38 years. However, by the end of the 1980s, northern Georgia needed another area code. On May 3, 1992, nearly all of the old 404 territory outside of metro Atlanta was split off with area code 706. As originally drawn, 706 included several exurbs of Atlanta. However, BellSouth (now part of AT&T Inc.) returned them to 404 because of customer complaints. The 404/706 boundary was redrawn in a way that left Columbus and its surrounding area cut off from the rest of 706, making 706 one of the few area codes that are not contiguous. However, 404 was still close to exhaustion even after the creation of 706. The Georgia Public Service Commission had already planned to assign 770 to Atlanta's suburbs later in the decade. However, the decision to return the Atlanta exurbs to 404 forced the GPSC to shift nearly all of Atlanta's suburban ring to 770 on August 1, 1995, sooner than had been planned. \n\nThe 404/770 boundary roughly follows Interstate 285, locally known as \"the Perimeter.\" Generally, 404 is Atlanta itself and most suburbs inside the Perimeter (such as Decatur), while most of the metro area outside the Perimeter uses 770. The boundary was drawn in such a way that a number of areas are split between the two codes. For some time after the 770 split, 404 continued to be used for all cellphones in metro Atlanta. 404/770 became one of the six pairs of \"doughnut area codes\" in the numbering plan.\n\nThe 1995 split was intended as a long-term solution. However, within two years both 404 and 770 were close to exhaustion due to Atlanta's explosive growth and the proliferation of cellphones and pagers. On January 1, 1998, area code 678 was introduced as an overlay area code for 404 and 770. Since then, ten-digit dialing has been mandatory throughout metro Atlanta. Because the Federal Communications Commission would not allow an area code to apply only to cellphones, mobile customers throughout the metro area were given the option of choosing numbers in the 404, 770 and 678 area codes when signing up for service. \n\nWithin only two years, it was apparent that a fourth area code was needed for metro Atlanta. On September 2, 2001, area code 470 was overlaid on top of the 404, 770, and 678 area codes. When telephone numbers in area code 678 are exhausted, 470-numbers will be assigned. The number was chosen by the Georgia Public Service Commission and approved by the NANPA, as were the previous splits and overlays for new area codes in the state. This has the effect of allocating 31.2 million numbers to a metropolitan area of 6.4 million people.\n\nTelephone numbers for high-capacity lines, such as for contest lines for radio stations, are assigned with the central office prefix 741. When 770 was split, these numbers continued to work as both 404-741-\"xxxx\" and as 770-741-\"xxxx\", so that only seven-digit dialing was necessary. That lasted until 678 came into use. There are also other prefixes that are not assigned to just one exchange, such as 499 and 528 used by Cobb County government and formerly SPSU. These were completely moved into 770.\n\nIn November 2013, the NANPA announced the exhaustion of available number blocks for area code 404, citing significant population growth in Atlanta.\n\nArea code 404 serves landlines and cellphones in portions of Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties, as well as cellphones in portions of Cobb, Douglas and Gwinnett counties. All are shared with area code 770.\n\nThe entire metro Atlanta region (404, 770, 678/470 and parts of 706/762) is a local calling area, one of the largest in the United States; no long-distance charges are applied for calls from one part of the region to the other.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966830", "title": "Missa in tempore belli", "text": "Missa in tempore belli\n\nMissa in tempore belli (\"\"), Hob. XXII/9, is a setting of the mass by Joseph Haydn. It is catalogued Mass No. 10 in C major, (H. XXII:9). Known also as the Paukenmesse due to the dramatic use of timpani, it is one of the most popular of his fourteen mass settings. The autograph manuscript contains the title \"Missa in tempore belli\" in Haydn's handwriting.\n\nHaydn composed this mass at Eisenstadt in August 1796, at the time of Austria’s general mobilisation into war. Four years into the European war that followed the French Revolution, Austrian troops were doing badly against the French in Italy and Germany, and Austria feared invasion. Reflecting the troubled mood of his time, Haydn integrated references to battle in the Benedictus and Agnus Dei movements. The Mass was first performed on 26 December 1796, in the Piarist Church of Maria Treu in Vienna.\n\nHaydn was a deeply religious man who appended the words “Praise be to God” at the end of every completed score. As Kapellmeister to Prince Nikolaus II Esterházy, Haydn’s principal duty in the last period of his life, beginning in 1796, was the composition of an annual mass to honour the name day of Prince Nicholas’ wife, Princess Maria Hermenegild, 8 September, the birth of the Blessed Virgin. In a final flowering of his genius, he faithfully completed six magnificent masses (with increasingly larger orchestras) for this occasion. Thus \"Missa in Tempore Belli\" was performed at the family church, the Bergkirche, at Eisenstadt on 29 September 1797. Haydn also composed his oratorio \"The Creation\" around the same time and the two great works share some of his signature vitality and tone-painting.\n\nThis piece has been long thought to express an anti-war sentiment, even though there is no explicit message in the text itself, and no clear indication from Haydn that this was his intention. What is found in the score is a very unsettled nature to the music, not normally associated with Haydn, which has led scholars to the conclusion that it is anti-war in nature. This is especially noticed in the Benedictus and Agnus Dei. During the time of the composition of the Mass, the Austrian government had issued a decree in 1796, that \"no Austrian should speak of peace until the enemy is driven back to its customary borders.\" Whether this is enough to call it anti-war in nature is certainly debatable because most of the mass is of a lyrically joyful nature.\n\nThe vocal parts of the mass are performed by four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) and a four-part choir. The soloists often appear as an ensemble, without arias. Haydn scored the mass for a large orchestra, even adding instruments for a performance in Vienna.\nIn the following table of the movements, the markings, keys and time signatures are taken from the choral score, using the symbols for common time and alla breve. The choir and orchestra are present in all movements.\n\nThe \"Kyrie\" opens like a symphony in sonata form, with a slow introduction before moving on to the main theme. The \"Kyrie Eleison\" (Lord have Mercy) part is given more importance—the \"Christe Eleison\" occupies just four bars.\n\nThe \"Gloria\" is a little choral symphony in the form Vivace-Adagio-Allegro (Fast-Slow-Fast). The lyrical, and deeply felt cello and baritone part in the middle section, beginning \"Qui tollis peccata mundi\" is especially beautiful.\n\nThe \"Credo\" is divided into sections that generally reflect the text, but with Haydn's usual overriding sense of structure. At the opening, as each voice part enters with a joyous and rhythmic theme, it takes a different line of the text. The Crucifixus is set in triple meter. A truncated fugue begins at the last line, but it is interrupted midway by an elaborate coda using the solo quartet, with the chorus joining in antiphonally.\n\nThe \"Sanctus\" opens slowly, but builds to a rather ominous forte on the text \"Pleni sunt coeli\" before moving to a brief, more genteel \"Hosanna in Excelsis\". \n\nThe \"In Tempore Belli\" first suggests itself in the \"Benedictus\". This is set mostly in short nervous phrases for the solo quartet, with the three lower voices singing detached notes below the soprano melody reminiscent of pizzicato strings.\n\nThe sense of anxiety and foreboding continues with ominous drumbeats and wind fanfares in the \"Agnus Dei\", which opens with minor-key timpani strokes (hence the German nickname, Paukenmesse), perhaps fate itself, knocking seemingly from the depths. This foreshadows the timpani-catalysed drama of the \"Agnus Dei\" in Beethoven's \"Missa Solemnis\". The music brightens with trumpet fanfares, ending with an almost dance-like entreaty and celebration of peace, \"Dona nobis pacem\" (Give us peace).\n\n"}
{"id": "1966840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966840", "title": "Neisseria meningitidis", "text": "Neisseria meningitidis\n\nNeisseria meningitidis, often referred to as meningococcus, is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic and endemic form. \"N. meningitidis\" is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing on toys and even through sharing a source of fresh water. It has also been reported to be transmitted through oral sex and cause urethritis in men. It infects its host cells by sticking to them with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors.\n\nMeningococcus can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease. \nIt initially produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and headache and can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma and death in 10% of cases. Petechiae occur in about 50% of cases. Chance of survival is highly correlated with blood cortisol levels, and so a reduction in cortisol can be used to determine likelihood of patient mortality. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as \"Haemophilus influenzae\" and \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\". Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected, intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital. This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of \"Neisseria meningitidis\" as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death.\n\nSepticaemia caused by \"Neisseria meningitidis\" has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths. Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash, that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass (\"non-blanching\") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset.\n\nOther severe complications include Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome, a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nNot all instances of a purpura-like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia; other possible causes, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a platelet disorder) and Henoch–Schönlein purpura, also need prompt investigation.\n\n\"N. meningitidis\" is a Gram-negative diplococcus since it has an outer and inner membranes with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. It is 0.6–1.0 micrometers in size. It tests positive for the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase.\n\n\"N. meningitidis\" is a part of the normal nonpathogenic flora in the nasopharynx of up to 5–15% of adults. It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been isolated from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron from sources other than human transferrin and lactoferrin.\n\nDisease-causing strains are classified according to the antigenic structure of their polysaccharide capsule. Serotype distribution varies markedly around the world. Among the 13 identified capsular types of \"N. meningitidis\", six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) account for most disease cases worldwide. Type A has been the most prevalent in Africa and Asia, but is rare/practically absent in North America. In the United States, serogroup B is the predominant cause of disease and mortality, followed by serogroup C. The multiple subtypes have hindered development of a universal vaccine for meningococcal disease.\n\nLipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a component of the outer membrane of \"N. meningitidis\". This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells. Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule which prevents host phagocytosis and aids in evasion of the host immune response; fimbriae mediate attachment of the bacterium to the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc. Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system.\n\nA hypervirulent strain was discovered in China. Its impact is yet to be determined.\n\nFactor H binding protein (fHbp) that is exhibited in \"N. meningitidis\" and some commensal species is the main inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. fHbp protects meningococci from complement-mediated death in human serum experiments, but has also been shown to protect meningococci from antimicrobial peptides \"in vitro\". Factor H binding protein is key to the pathogenesis of \"N. meningitidis\", and is, therefore, important as a potential vaccine candidate. Porins are also an important factor for complement inhibition for both pathogenic and commensal species. Porins are important for nutrient acquisition. Porins are also recognized by TLR2, they bind complement factors (C3b, C4b, factor H, and C4bp (complement factor 4b-binding protein)). Cooperation with pili for CR3-mediated internalization is another function of porins. Ability to translocate into host cells and modulate reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis is made possible by porins, as well. Strains of the same species can express different porins.\n\nAt least 8 complete genomes of \"Neisseria meningitidis\" strains have been determined which encode about 2,100 to 2,500 proteins.\n\nThe genome of strain MC58 (serogroup B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, it was found to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a biological function was predicted for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen then known. Phase variation is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host.\n\nThe genome size of strain H44/76 is 2.18 Mb, and encodes 2,480 open reading frames (ORFs), compared to 2.27 Mb and 2,465 ORFs for MC58. Both strains have a GC content of 51.5%. A comparison with MC58 showed that four genes are uniquely present in H44/76 and nine genes are only present in MC58. Of all ORFs in H44/76, 2,317 (93%) show more than 99% sequence identity.\n\nThe complete genome sequence of strain NMA510612 (serogroup A) consists of one circular chromosome with a size of 2,188,020 bp, and the average GC content is 51.5%. The chromosome is predicted to possess 4 rRNA operons, 163 insertion elements (IS), 59 tRNAs, and 2,462 ORFs.\n\nGenetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient’s genome by recombination. In \"N. meningitidis\", DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9–10 mers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA. These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs). Specific recognition of these sequences is mediated by a type IV pilin. In \"N. meningitidis\" DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. The over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes, that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell.\n\n\"N. meningititis\" colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is rich in macrophages. Upon their activation, macrophages produce superoxide (O2¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thus \"N. meningitidis\" is likely to encounter oxidative stress during its life cycle. Consequently, an important benefit of genetic transformation to \"N. meningitidis\" may be the maintenance of the recombination and repair machinery of the cell that removes oxidative DNA damages such as those caused by reactive oxygen. This is consistent with the more general idea that transformation benefits bacterial pathogens by facilitating repair of DNA damages produced by the oxidative defenses of the host during infection.\n\nWith a fatality risk approaching 15% within 12 hours of infection, it is crucial to initiate testing as quickly as possible, but not to wait for the results before initiating antibiotic therapy.\n\nA small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. The diagnosis is suspected, when Gram-negative diplococci are seen on Gram stain of a centrifuged sample of CSF; sometimes they are located inside white blood cells. The microscopic identification takes around 1–2 hours after specimen arrival in the laboratory.\n\nThe gold standard of diagnosis is microbiological isolation of \"N. meningitidis\" by growth from a sterile body fluid, which could be CSF or blood. Diagnosis is confirmed when the organism has grown, most often on a chocolate agar plate, but also on Thayer-Martin agar. To differentiate any bacterial growth from other species a small amount of a bacterial colony is tested for oxidase, catalase for which all clinically relevant \"Neisseria\" show a positive reaction, and the carbohydrates maltose, sucrose, and glucose, in which \"N. meningitidis\" will ferment that is, utilize the glucose and maltose. Finally, serology determines the subgroup of the \"N. meningitidis\", which is important for epidemiological surveillance purposes; this may often only be done in specialized laboratories.\n\nThe above tests take a minimum of 48–72 hours turnaround time for growing the organism, and up to a week more for serotyping. Growth can and often does fail, either because antibiotics have been given preemptively, or because specimens have been inappropriately transported, as the organism is extremely susceptible to antibiotics and fastidious in its temperature, and growth medium requirements.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests where available, mostly in industrialized countries, have been increasingly used; PCR can rapidly identify the organism, and works even after antibiotics have been given.\n\nAll recent contacts of the infected patient over the 7 days before onset should receive medication to prevent them from contracting the infection. This especially includes young children and their child caregivers or nursery-school contacts, as well as anyone who had direct exposure to the patient through kissing, sharing utensils, or medical interventions such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Anyone who frequently ate, slept or stayed at the patient's home during the 7 days before the onset of symptom, or those who sat beside the patient on an airplane flight or classroom for 8 hours or longer, should also receive chemoprophylaxis. The agent of choice is usually oral rifampicin for a few days.\n\nReceiving a dose of the \"Meningococcal vaccine\" before traveling to a country in the \"meningitis belt\" or having a booster meningitis vaccine, normally five years apart could prevent someone from getting an infection from the pathogen.\n\nA number of vaccines are available in the U.S. to prevent meningococcal disease. Some of the vaccines cover serogroup B, while others cover A, C, W, and Y. A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s and is the only meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. MPSV4 may be used in people 2–55 years old if the MCV4 vaccines are not available or contraindicated. Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV4) are licensed for use in the U.S. The first conjugate vaccine was licensed in 2005, the second in 2010. Conjugate vaccines are the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age. It is indicated in those with impaired immunity, such as nephrotic syndrome or splenectomy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes information about who should receive meningococcal vaccine.\n\nIn June 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a combination vaccine against two types of meningococcal diseases and Hib disease for infants and children 6 weeks to 18 months old. The vaccine, Menhibrix, was designed to prevent disease caused by \"Neisseria meningitidis\" serogroups C and Y, and \"Haemophilus influenzae\" type b (Hib). It was the first meningococcal vaccine that could be given to infants as young as six weeks old.\n\nIn October 2014 the FDA approved the first vaccine effective against serogroup B, named Trumenba, for use in 10- to 25-year-old individuals.\n\nIn 2010, the Meningitis Vaccine Project introduced a vaccine called MenAfriVac in the African meningitis belt. It was made by generic drug maker Serum Institute of India and cost 50 U.S. cents per injection. Beginning in Burkina Faso in 2010, it has been given to 215 million people across Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Togo and Gambia. The vaccination campaign has resulted in near-elimination of serogroup A meningitis from the participating countries.\n\nPersons with confirmed \"N. meningitidis\" infection should be hospitalized immediately for treatment with antibiotics. Because meningococcal disease can disseminate very rapidly, a single dose of intramuscular antibiotic is often given at the earliest possible opportunity, even before hospitalization, if disease symptoms look suspicious enough. Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics (i.e. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) should be used to treat a suspected or culture-proven meningococcal infection before antibiotic susceptibility results are available. Empirical treatment should also be considered if a lumbar puncture, to collect CSF for laboratory testing, cannot be done within 30 minutes of admission to hospital. Antibiotic treatment may affect the results of microbiology tests, but a diagnosis may be made on the basis of blood-cultures and clinical examination.\n\n\"N. meningitidis\" is a major cause of illness, developmental impairment and death during childhood in industrialized countries and has been responsible for epidemics in Africa and in Asia. Every year, about 2,500 to 3,500 people become infected with \"N. meningitidis\" in the US, with a frequency of about 1 in 100,000. Children younger than 5 years are at greatest risk, followed by teenagers of high school age. Rates in the African meningitis belt were as high as 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100 before introduction of a vaccine in 2010. The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest among infants (children younger than 1-year-old) whose immune system is relatively immature. In industrialized countries there is a second peak of incidence in young adults, who are congregating closely, living in dormitories or smoking. Vaccine development is ongoing.\nIt is spread through saliva and other respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. Inhalation of respiratory droplets from a carrier which may be someone who is themselves in the early stages of disease can transmit the bacteria. Close contact with a carrier is the predominant risk factor. Other risk factors include a weakened general or local immune response, such as a recent upper respiratory infection, smoking, and complement deficiency. The incubation period is short, from 2 to 10 days. In susceptible individuals, \"N. meningitidis\" may invade the bloodstream and cause a systemic infection, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, breakdown of circulation, and septic shock.\n\nIn 1884 Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Celli first observed the bacterium inside cells in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). In 1887 Anton Weichselbaum isolated the bacterium from the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis. He named the bacterium \"Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1966858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966858", "title": "Tarkus (song)", "text": "Tarkus (song)\n\n\"Tarkus\" is the title track of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's second album. The progressive rock epic lasts 20:35. It was the longest studio song by the band until the three impressions of \"Karn Evil 9\". The name \"Tarkus\" refers to the armadillo-tank from the William Neal paintings on the album cover. The artist has explained that the name is an amalgamation between 'Tartarus' (a place of punishment mentioned in 2 Peter 2:4) and 'carcass' (hence the name being written in bones on the album cover). Consequently, the name refers to the \"futility of war, a man made mess with symbols of mutated destruction.\" The song \"Tarkus\" itself supposedly follows the adventures of Tarkus from his birth, through a fight with a manticore, which he loses and concludes with an aquatic version of Tarkus named \"Aquatarkus\". \nKeith Emerson, when asked what work he is proudest of, named his Piano Concerto (from the \"Works\" release) and Tarkus.\n\n\"Tarkus\" itself is broken down into seven parts (timings reflect the beginning cues for each section):\n\n\nAll the music except 'Battlefield' (written by Lake) is written by Emerson. All the lyrics are written by Lake. \n\nThe parts supposedly follow Tarkus' birth in a volcanic eruption centuries before known history. The exact nature of Tarkus' origin and actions are unknown, and left ambiguous by its creator, Keith Emerson. \"Eruption\" itself presents a musical impression of cascading eruption on the keyboards in a time signature, backed by Carl Palmer on drums. This segues into the \"Stones of Years\", the first of three vocal sections.\n\nThe second, third, fourth and fifth are supposedly the movements that represent the enemies he meets:\nAccording to Emerson, while Palmer was excited by some of the technical opportunities the song would present, Lake was not quite so enamoured, telling Emerson \"\"If you want to play that sort of stuff, I suggest you play it on your solo album.\"\" The band almost broke up over the issue, Emerson telling Lake \"\"Take it or leave it.\"\" The managers convinced Lake to stay and record the piece. Lake evidently did have the album grow on him, stating in an interview after the release: \"It's about the futility of conflict expressed in [the] context [...] of soldiers and war. But it's broader than that. The words are about revolution that's gone, that has happened. Where has it got anybody? Nowhere.\" He has also complimented \"Stones of Years\" as one of his favourite parts of \"Tarkus\". Lake admits to not being entirely sure of what it means, but says it is about, \"listening, understanding, hearing.\"\nWhen asked how Tarkus could be written so quickly (six days), Emerson said: \nOur sort of creativity comes in varying periods. We get long periods when there isn't any creativity, we go into a studio and nothing sounds right, you know. Tarkus was written in six days because there was an awful lot of inspiration and one idea triggered another idea, and it was a long series of ideas being triggered off of what we had already done.\n\nThe song, described by one journalist to be \"about a post-apocalyptic, metal-plated, bionic armadillo outfitted with enough weaponry to wage perpetual solo warfare,\" remains a fan favourite and was consistently played at ELP, Keith Emerson Band and Carl Palmer band concerts.\n\n\"Stones of Years\" was used as a single from \"Tarkus\". The album as a whole reached number 1 on UK charts and number 9 in the US.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer played a 27-minute version of Tarkus on \"Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends... Ladies and Gentlemen, Emerson, Lake & Palmer\". A brief sample of King Crimson's \"Epitaph\" (\"Confusion will be my epitaph, as I crawl a cracked and broken path, if we make it we can all sit back and laugh...\") appears as a coda to Battlefield, followed by Aquatarkus and an extended solo by Emerson.\n\nIn 2004, the Japanese classical pianist Aki Kuroda released an album with a classical adaptation of \"Tarkus\".\n\nIn 2007, Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess included a cover of this song in his solo album \"The Road Home\", which consists mostly of covers of classic progressive rock songs.\n\nEmerson recorded a new instrumental version with Marc Bonilla, Terje Mikkelsen and the Munich Radio Orchestra, which appears on their 2012 album \"Three Fates\" under the title \"Tarkus – Concertante\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966863", "title": "Emperor of the North Pole", "text": "Emperor of the North Pole\n\nEmperor of the North Pole is a 1973 American DeLuxe Color film directed by Robert Aldrich, starring Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Keith Carradine. It was later re-released on home media (and is more widely known) under the shorter title Emperor of the North, ostensibly chosen by studio executives to avoid being mistaken for a heartwarming holiday story. This original title is an homage to the historic joke among Great Depression-era hobos that the world's best hobo was \"Emperor of the North Pole\", a way of poking fun at their own desperate situation, implying that somebody ruling over the North Pole would reign over nothing but a vast, barren, cold, empty, and stark wasteland.\n\nThe film depicts the story of two hobos' struggle (esp. vs. \"The Establishment\") during the US' Great Depression in 1930s Oregon. Its screenplay is quite significantly inspired by three separate, yet inter-related self-published seminal writings from earlier decades: Jack London's better-known 1907 travel memoir, \"The Road\", and, two lesser-known books, both by legendary hobo \"A-No.-1\", pen-name of Leon Ray Livingston, \"The Trail of the Tramp\", and his 1917 travelogue, \"From Coast to Coast with Jack London\".\n\nCarradine's character, Cigaret, uses the moniker that Jack London used during his hobo escapades, and like London, is portrayed as a young traveling companion to the older Livingston's A-No.-1 (played by Marvin), but that is where (some assert) the similarity between Carradine's character and Jack London ends, as Cigaret is portrayed in the film as immature, loud-mouthed, and not bright, opposite A-No.-1's gracious and graceful seasoned veteran.\n\nShack (Ernest Borgnine) is a merciless, inhumane, and sadistic bully, a dedicated Company Man/Railroad conductor on the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railroad, during the Great Depression. He takes it upon himself to ensure that no one ever rides his freight train, the #19, for free, and that anyone who attempts, literally dies trying. Shack has an arsenal of makeshift weapons: several differently-sized hammers, a steel coupler pin tied to the end of a length of rope, a 4-6' chain, and a high pressure steam hose from the locomotive, all wielded with brute force. During the opening credits, he hammers a hobo on the head whom he's found riding between two cars, causing the \"bo\" to fall down between, & under the cars, onto the tracks, and be cut in two by the train's wheels.\n\nA hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.-1 (Lee Marvin) manages to hop the train, and the younger, less-experienced Cigaret (Keith Carradine) secretly coattails him closely behind, only to be unwittingly seen by Shack, who then locks them inside the car from outside, sealing their exit. Upon realizing their plight, A-No.-1 sets fire to the onboard hay load as a means to exit 'under cover' from the wooden livestock car in which he and Cigaret are now trapped. As Shack directs the crew to stop the train in an approaching rail yard to have yard workers help extinguish the fire and then catch his stowaways, A-No.-1 evades them all, escapes to the hobo jungle, greets his old pal Smile, who, in turn, rouses, and declares to the assembled huddle that \"A-No.-1 is \"King of The Road, having just arrived on the 19!\". Meanwhile, Cigaret is caught by laborers back at the rail yard, who then brags to them (Vic Tayback, Matt Clark, Hal Baylor, and others) that he was the one who rode Shack's train and that the other tramp got them caught, and burned to death in the fire. Most of the workers believe him, and they dispatch another \"bo\" to spread the word back at the Hobo Jungle that Cigaret is the one who finally beat Shack. When this tramp arrives in the hobo jungle to spread the word, A-No.-1 is there, and is confronted with the story that the young braggart Cigaret is taking credit for his deed. Indignant, A-No.-1 determines to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland to prove that only he is capable of such a bold act. He has another young tenderfoot hobo tag his intention high up on the yard water tower, where everyone can see it. When word of this posting rapidly arrives back in the train shed, Shack is in the process of strangling Cigaret for daring to claim he has ridden Shack's train. Forgotten by the yard workers in their excitement over whether A-No.-1 will succeed, Cigaret quietly slips out unnoticed. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \"Emperor of the North Pole.\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news up and down the line by telephone and telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked.\n\nThe next morning is foggy. One of the hobos picks the lock on a switch so that Shack's train, Number 19, will be shunted onto a branch linesiding, making it easier for A-No.-1 to board. A-No.-1 unhitches the engine and tender from the freight cars to keep Shack further at bay, and Shack yells to A-No.-1 (now hiding back in the foggy woods) that this prank might cost 10 lives when the fast mail train comes through in just a few minutes. A-No.-1 challenges this as merely \"a ghost story.\" Hogger (the engineer), Coaly (the stoker), and Shack desperately get the train going again, and they barely succeed in getting it onto a siding, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic collision with the mail train, nearly giving their dimwitted brakeman Cracker (Charles Tyner) either a stroke, or heart attack from the stress of the near miss.\n\nA-No.-1 re-mounts the train, and hides inside a hollow metal pipe on a flatcar and as the morning advances and the fog burns off, he discovers that Cigaret is hiding in the adjacent pipe, and worse yet, may have alerted the #19's crew to their presence by leaving his hat out in the open on the flatcar's open decking. Shack stops the train on a high trestle so that he and Cracker can search for hobos more easily. Realizing that he will soon be discovered, Cigaret climbs down the trestle only to discover that A-No.-1 is already relaxing and smoking a cigar in a junk pile at the bottom of a ravine. They reboard the train beyond the trestle but A-No.-1 loses his grip (Shack has sabotaged some of the hand- and footholds) and falls off. Shack strikes Cigaret on the head with a large hammer, causing him to also fall off.\n\nThe two men go back to the junk pile and haul several buckets up the slope where they smear the rails with grease. A passenger train is slowed down sufficiently by this such that A-No.-1 and Cigaret are able to jump onto the roof of one of the cars from an overhead sluice. The two jump off at the Salem yard and A-No.-1 uses Cigaret as a foil to steal a turkey. A policeman (Simon Oakland) chases them to a hobo jungle, but is surrounded and forced to humiliate himself by barking like a dog. A-No.-1, by now deeply annoyed by Cigaret's empty boasts, tells the younger man that if he will only listen and allow himself to learn, he has what it takes to become a true hobo, possibly even Emperor of the North Pole. A-No.-1 then gets involved in a local ongoing immersion baptism service as a means of having Cigaret steal a change of clothes for them both.\n\nBack in the Salem yard, A-No.-1 has once again tagged on the water tower his intent to ride The \"#19 (train) all the way to Portland\". Shack tells Hogger to take the train out of the yard at regular speed, thereby allowing the two hobos to board easily; Shack clearly wants to settle the matter once and for all. A-No.-1 and Cigaret climb aboard the undercarriage of one of the freight cars, where Shack (once again) drags a steel coupler pin on the end of a rope (bouncing off the passing track ties under the moving train) to injure them. In pain, A-No.-1 uses his foot to throw a lever that releases the pressure in the brake lines, causing the train to stop quickly. Coaly is thrown against the firebox, severely burning his back. Cracker is flung from his perch in the caboose, breaking his neck and dying in the process. Cigaret finds A-No.-1 nursing his injuries near a pond and berates him for lacking the strength and courage to go the distance. The younger man insists that he himself is going to become one of the all-time great hobos.\n\nAfter this tirade, Cigaret reboards the train, but immediately retreats in fear from the hammer-wielding and very angry Shack. Just as Shack is about to deliver a fatal blow, A-No.-1 appears and begins battling Shack. A desperate struggle involving heavy chains, planks of wood, and a fire axe ensues (Cigaret watches from a safe distance, atop the caboose). A-No.-1 ultimately has the bloodied Shack at his mercy, but instead of killing him, throws him off the train. In defiance, Shack yells that A-No.-1 has not seen the last of him. A-No.-1 then tosses Cigaret off for bragging about how \"they\" defeated Shack, telling the kid he could have become a good bum but he's got no class. \"You had the juice, kid, but not the heart,\" he yells, as the train rolls away to Portland, beyond the distant horizon.\n\nThe film was announced in January 1972.\n\nBorgnine's fee was $150,000.\n\nThe film was shot in and around the city of Cottage Grove, Oregon (also the location used by Buster Keaton for his 1927 railroad feature \"The General\"), along the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway (OP&E)'s active right-of-way. Willis Kyle, president of the OP&E in 1972, allowed the film company unlimited access to make the film, after an agreement with Oregon Governor Tom McCall and 20th Century Fox. Oregon, Pacific and Eastern's rolling stock, including two steam locomotives (one being #19, a type 2-8-2 Baldwin Locomotive Works logging/mining Light Mikado, the other, #5, an ALCO 2-8-0 Consolidation), appear in the film. Also featured in the film is the Dorena Reservoir, located about 10 miles east of Cottage Grove, OP&E's railyard in downtown Cottage Grove, and the former Portland, Astoria, & Pacific Railroad's 1913-built timber trestle bridge over Mendenhall Creek near Buxton, Oregon, now part of the Banks–Vernonia State Trail.\n\nFilming finished on October 5, 1972.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, \"The movie’s energies are vast but never focused; what we’re finally left with is too much undirected violence and some superb direction in an uncertain cause.\"\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" praised the film as \"a fine, elaborately staged action melodrama,\" with \"splendid performances\" and \"almost perfect action-movie characters, people who can't bore us with their earlier histories because they don't have any. They exist solely within the time and the action of the film itself. When it stops, they vanish, but we have had a sensational ride.\"\n\n\"Variety\" found the storyline \"limited in scope and insufficient to sustain a full-length feature ... While there is a wealth of violence under Robert Aldrich's forceful direction, the motivating idea is bogged down frequently with time out while Marvin expounds the philosophy and finer points of hobodom to a brash young kid (Keith Carradine) who wants terribly to be accepted.\"\n\nGene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it \"a dismal adventure yarn\" with \"nothing in the script to make us care about either man.\"\n\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the film as \"a robust, rollicking adventure yarn\" with \"one of the finest original screenplays to come out of Hollywood this year.\"\n\nGary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" knocked the \"gratuitous, cartoon screenplay\" and went on to state, \"The whole point of the movie is the climax. Without that spectacular, sickening interlude of violence, the project would be completely negligible. The film's success depends on finding more people who are excited than repelled at the prospect of watching Lee Marvin hit Ernest Borgnine with an axe.\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino later wrote \"theoretically Aldrich should have been perfect for \"Emperor of the North\". But instead of the muscular rusty claw hammer type direction you’d expect from the big man, Aldrich gives into corny thirties theatrics. The film seems more like a Damon Runyonesque musical about hobos than the crowbar vs. chain donnybrook that MGM sold it to audiences as.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave the film a 71% while the audience score was much higher with 85%.\n\nThe film was a box office failure. Aldrich later said he'll \"never understand\" why this happened.\nI thought the symbols were so clear. It never occurred to me that the audience would miss the relationship - that Borgnine was the Establishment, that Marvin was the anti-Establishment individualistic character, and that Keith Carradine was the opportunistic youth who would sell out for whatever was most convenient. I never thought that people wouldn't root for the Marvin character. I thought everyone would say, \"I understand what Marvin is. He's trying not to be regimented and suppressed, and denied his rights, and I'm for him. \" And nobody was. It just didn't happen. Nobody cared.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, Intrada Records released the only commercial CD version of composer Frank De Vol's soundtrack to the public, 35 years after the film's release. The CD, limited to 1,200 copies, immediately sold out. Featuring several unused score cues, it was learned that Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers had originally recorded the vocals for the film's score, but was replaced at the last minute for unknown reasons by Marty Robbins.\n\nThe theme ballad, \"A Man and a Train\", written by Frank De Vol with lyrics by Hal David and sung by Marty Robbins, appears on his album \"All-Time Greatest Hits\" (Catalog# 77425), and the CD \"The Best of Marty Robbins\" released by Curb Records in January 2006, both featuring a second verse not used in the film.\n\nThe film was released in North America on DVD by Pentrex on June 5, 2006, under the title \"Emperor of the North\". The Region 2 version was available under general release in the UK from September 3, 2007, under the same title. It was also released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time on September 8, 2015.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1966875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966875", "title": "Fumonisin B1", "text": "Fumonisin B1\n\nFumonisin B is the most prevalent member of a family of toxins, known as fumonisins, produced by several species of \"Fusarium\" molds, such as \"Fusarium verticillioides\", which occur mainly in maize (corn), wheat and other cereals. Fumonisin B1 contamination of maize has been reported worldwide at mg/kg levels. Human exposure occurs at levels of micrograms to milligrams per day and is greatest in regions where maize products are the dietary staple.\n\nFumonisin B is hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic in all animal species tested. The earliest histological change to appear in either the liver or kidney of fumonisin-treated animals is increased apoptosis followed by regenerative cell proliferation. While the acute toxicity of fumonisin is low, it is the known cause of two diseases which occur in domestic animals with rapid onset: equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary oedema syndrome. Both of these diseases involve disturbed sphingolipid metabolism and cardiovascular dysfunction.\n\nIn 1970, an outbreak of leukoenchephalomalacia (ELEM) in horses in South Africa was associated with the contamination of corn with the fungus \"Fusarium verticillioides\". It is one of the most prevalent seed-borne fungi associated with corn. Another study was done on the possible role of fungal toxins in the etiology of human esophageal cancer in a region in South Africa. The diet of the people living in this area was homegrown corn and F. verticillioides was the most prevalent fungus in the corn consumed by the people with high incidence of esophageal cancer. Further outbreaks of ELEM and people in certain regions with high incidence of esophageal cancer led to more research on F.verticillioides. Soon they found experimentally that F.verticillioides caused ELEM in horses and porcine pulmonary edema in pigs. It was found to be highly hepatotoxic and cardiotoxic in rats. In 1984 it was shown that the fungus was hepatocarcinogenic in rats. The chemical nature of the metabolite(s) causing all this had still not been discovered in 1984. After discovery of the carcinogenicity of the fungus, isolation and chemical characterization of the mycotoxin(s) and carcinogen(s) produced by F.verticillioides was urgent. It wasn't until 1988 that the chemical nature of the carcinogen was unraveled. Fumonisin B and fumonisin B were isolated from cultures of F.verticillioides at PROMEC (Programme on Mycotoxins and Experimental Carcinogenesis). The structures were elucidated in collaboration with the CSIR(Council for Scientific and Industrial Research). Now approximately 15 different fumonisins are known, the most important ones being fumonisin B, B and B.\n\nRegarding toxicokinetics there are no human data available, but research on animals has been done.\n\nFB is taken orally via food. Overall, FB is poorly absorbed, less than 6%.\nAbsorption of orally administered fumonisin B (10 mg/kg body weight) to rats is low (3.5% of dose) but rapid (T = 1.02 h).\nFB does not significantly permeate through the human skin and hence has no significant systemic health risk after dermal exposure.\n\nAfter absorption, some appears to be retained in liver and kidneys. For rats that were fed diets containing fumonisins for several weeks, the concentrations of the fumonisins in the kidneys were approximately 10-fold higher than in the liver.\n\nPlasma distribution of the absorbed dose conformed to a two-compartment open model and the tissue (liver, kidney) concentration time results were consistent with a one-compartment open model.\n\nElimination half-life in rats is 3.15 h for plasma, 4.07 h for liver, and 7.07 h for kidney. However, FB is rapidly excreted mostly in its original form. Small amounts are excreted in urine; the most are excreted in feces.\n\nBecause of their similarity, fumonisins are able to inhibit sphingosine-sphinganin-transferases and ceramide synthases and are therefore competitive inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism.\n\nFigure 2 shows the sphingolipid metabolism (schematic) and the inhibition caused by fumonisins. Fumonisin B inhibits the enzyme ceramide synthase (sphingosine \"N\"-acyltransferase), which acylates sphingoid bases. This blocks the formation of ceramide via two pathways. It inhibits de formation via de novo sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA and via sphingosine produced by the breakdown of ceramide by ceramidase.\nThe inhibition results in increased concentrations of sphinganine, sphingosine and their 1-phosphate metabolites and in decreased concentrations of complex sphingolipids.\nThe accumulation of sphinganine and sphingosine is a primary cause of the toxicity of fumonisin B Sphinganine and sphingosine are cytotoxic, and have growth inhibitory effects. Also, these sphingoid bases induce apoptosis. Increased apoptosis seems to play an important role in the toxic effects including tumor induction. \nHowever, it should be mentioned that the reduced concentration of ceramide and the increased concentration of sphingosine-1-phosphate (as a result of FB intake) cause an inhibition of apoptosis and promote mitosis and regeneration. The balance between the intracellular concentration of compounds that inhibit apoptosis and those that induce apoptosis will determine the cellular response.\nAlso, the decreased concentrations of complex sphingolipids appear to play a role in the abnormal behavior and altered morphology of the affected cells.\n\nThe proposed mechanism of action is depicted in figure 3. Fumonisin B occupies the space and electrostatic interactions of both sphinganine (or sphingosine) and fatty acyl-CoA in ceramide synthase. The part of FB that has structural similarity with sphingoid bases (the aminopentol part) may interact with the sphinganine binding site, whereas the negatively charged tricarbyllic acid groups may interact with the fatty acyl-CoA binding site.\n\nBecause FB also occupies the fatty acyl-CoA space, it isn’t acylated, since acyl-CoA is necessary for the acylation; FB only inhibits ceramide synthase. However, when the tricarbillic acid groups are removed from FB by hydrolysis, the resulting product (aminopentol, AP1) doesn’t only act as an inhibitor, but also as a substrate for ceramide synthase; aminopentol is acylated by ceramide synthase to form N-palmitoyl-AP1. This supports the suggestion that the aminopentol part of FB occupies the space of sphinganine in the enzyme. N-palmitoyl-AP1 is an even more potent inhibitor of ceramide synthase and may therefore play a role in the toxicity of nixtamalized fumonisins.\n\nThe risks of fumonisin B1 have been evaluated by The World Health Organization’s International Programme on Chemical Safety(IPCS) and the Scientific Committee on Food(SCF) of the European Commission. They determined a tolerable daily intake(TDI) for FB, FB, FB, alone or in combination of 2 µg/kg body weight. \nUntil now, nothing about the kinetics and metabolism of fumonisin B in humans have been reported. On other animals much research has been done, but it might not be comparable to humans. In mice the elimination of FB is very rapid, but in humans it could be much slower considering their body weight. \nThere are several possible pathways that cause toxic effects of Fumonisin B. Most toxic effects are due to altered sphingolipid metabolism by inhibition of ceramide synthase.\nProduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could occur. This increases oxidative stress and induce lipid peroxidation and could damage cells. In agreement with this some studies showed decreased levels of glutathion(GSH) in liver, but other studies showed even elevated levels of GSH. Cytotoxic effects have also been reported.\nAnother effect of exposure to FB is apoptosis. This has been observed in a number of different cells and tissues. Inhibition of ceramide synthase is not responsible for this effect. The main factors could be DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation.\nFB has also immunotoxic effects, but much more research is necessary to get a clear overview of the effects on the immune system.\n\nNeural tube defect (NTD) are defects of the brain and spinal cord in the embryo resulting from failure of the neural tube to close. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have pointed out folate deficiency as a major risk factor for NTD. FB disrupts sphingolipid metabolism and therefore this could affect folate uptake and cause NTD.\nIn 1990 and 1991 a sudden outbreak of neural tube defects occurred along the Texas-Mexico border. It is believed that this outbreak might have been due to high levels of FB that were observed in corn during previous years. Also regions in China and South Africa with high corn consumption show a high prevalence of NTD.\n\nIt is thought that there is a relationship between the occurrence of F.verticillioides and human esophageal cancer. A low socioeconomic status and a less varied diet, that mainly consists of corn and wheat, is associated with the appearance of esophageal cancer. This derives from epidemiologic studies in various countries. Other studies show that higher concentrations of FB, FB and F. verticillioides are present in corn growing in regions with a high percentage of esophageal cancer. This in contrast with regions with low levels of F.verticillioides, FB and FB in corn. On top of this it seems that people with a high corn intake are at higher risk to develop esophageal cancer than people with low corn intake. This is observed by people in regions in Italy, Iran, Kenia, Zimbabwe, United States and Brazil with high incidence of esophageal cancer.\nAnother study on the relationship between sphingolipid levels and cancer incidence didn’t show any significant relationship between serum sphingolipids and risk of esophageal cancer. This is quite remarkable, because elevated levels of sphingolipids sphinganine and sphingosine are believed to be biomarkers for exposure of FB.\n\nAcute mycotoxicosis is food poisoning by food products contaminated by fungi. In 1995 an outbreak of disease characterized by diarrhea and abdominal pain occurred in 27 villages in India. This was the result of consumption of moldy sorghum and corn due to rain damage. This outbreak was studied and the mycotoxicosis was connected to consumption of unleavened bread. Corn and sorghum samples were collected from the households and examined. The corn and sorghum were contaminated by Fusarium and Aspergillus and contained high levels of FB compared with samples of unaffected households.\n\nMuch research has been done on toxic effects of FB in animals. In vivo studies indicate that liver and kidneys are the main target organs. Fumonisins are poorly absorbed, rapidly eliminated and not metabolized in animals. In pigs and rats there is a wide distribution of FB and small amounts have been found to accumulate only in liver and kidneys. In vervet monkeys, some FB is partially hydrolyzed in the gut.\n\nIn rats and mice that were exposed to FB tumor formation occurred. Several studies on this subject have been done. Depending on the strain of mice being used different carcinomas were shown. FB is shown to be nongenotoxic. Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for cancer development should lie elsewhere. Important mechanisms for cancer development due to fumonisin B could be oxidative damage (ROS-production) and lipid peroxidation. Hepatic and renal tumors could also be due to apoptosis by FB. As a response to this there could be continuous regeneration of cells, causing cancer. It seems to be that disrupted sphingolipid metabolism is the causative factor for FB-induced carcinogenicity, as is the case with the toxic effects. \nBased on all these animal studies FB is classified by The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).\n\nPorcine pulmonary edema due to FB is intensively studied after the first report in 1981 of swine with pulmonary edema after exposure to corn contaminated with F.verticillioides. \nAlteration in sphingolipid biosynthesis are reported, especially in lung, heart, kindey and liver tissue. Lethal pulmonary edema was developed within 4–7 days after exposure to feed with concentrations of FB >16 mg/kg body weight (>92 ppm). Doses of 10ppm developed a milder form of pulmonary edema.\n\nLeukoenchephalomalacia (ELEM) is a neurotoxic disease of horses. Outbreaks of this disease in the 20th century resulted in a number of studies. Apparently FB was the cause for this disease. There were shown elevated levels of serum enzyme levels that indicate liver damage. They were normally observed by an elevation of the sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. FB possibly induces cardiovascular function, because of the elevated sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. This could be one of the main factors that causes ELEM.\n\nEffects of feeding rats with FB for up to 90 days were usually nephrotoxicity. Between different strains of rats, sensitivity to FB varied. In the kidneys the main effect was apoptosis. Also tubular atrophy and regeneration as well as decreased kidney weight was reported. Histopathologic effects on rat liver were reported after both short- and long-term exposure. The main cause was apoptosis. \nMice don’t seem to be very sensitive to nephrotoxic effects in comparison with rats. In mouse kidneys little histological changes were seen by high dose exposure. The liver was also the main target organ in mice. Pathology is similar as in rats, with apoptosis and hepatocellular hyperplasia.\nFumonisin B is possibly embryotoxic if the dose is maternally toxic. A number of studies on genotoxicity inidicated no mutagenetic effects. Although fumonisin could damage DNA directly by production of reactive oxygen species(ROS).\nMouse embryos were exposed to FB and they showed inhibited sphingolipid synthesis and growth. It caused NTD. Folic acid uptake was dramatically inhibited. Treatment after exposure with folic acid reduced NTD by 50–65%.\n\nThe risks of fumonisin B1 have been evaluated by The World Health Organization’s International Programme on Chemical Safety(IPCS) and the Scientific Committee on Food(SCF) of the European Commission. They determined a tolerable daily intake(TDI) for FB1, FB2, FB3, alone or in combination of 2 µg/kg body weight.\n\nThe inhibition of ceramide synthase by FB is thought to be reversible, since the binding is formed by noncovalent interactions. Factors that will probably induce this reversibility are reduction of cellular FB-concentration and increasing of cellular concentrations of the substrates for ceramide synthase. Also, the rate of removal of the accumulated sphinganine and sphingosine will affect the detoxification.\nThe information on metabolism and biotransformation of FB is very sparse. However, metabolism most likely occurs in the gut since partially hydrolysed and fully hydrolysed FB were recovered in faeces but not in bile of vervet monkeys.\nBioavailability of FB can be reduced by treating fumonisin-contaminated corn with glucomannans extracted from the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These polysaccharides are able to bind certain mycotoxins and have a 67% binding capacity for fumonisins.\n\n"}

She killed herself and their four-year-old daughter Shura using a gas oven, similar to Hughes's first wife Sylvia Plath's suicide, six years earlier.\n\nAssia Gutmann was the daughter of a Jewish physician of Latvian origin, Lonya Gutmann, and a German Lutheran mother, Elisabeth \"Lisa\" (née Gaedeke). Her sister Celia was born on 22 September 1929 and she escaped the Nazis at the beginning of World War II and emigrated to Israel. She spent most of her youth in Tel Aviv. Described by friends and family as a free-spirited young woman, she would go out to dance at the British soldiers' club, where she met Sergeant John Steele, who became her first husband and with whom she moved to London in 1946. According to her biographers, Yehuda Koren and Eilat Negev, \"she had entered an essentially loveless marriage with an Englishman at the age of 20 – largely to enable her family to emigrate to England.\" The couple later emigrated to Vancouver, Canada, where Assia enrolled at the University of British Columbia and met her second husband, Canadian economist Richard Lipsey.\n\nIn 1956, on a ship to London, she met the 21-year-old poet David Wevill. They began an affair and Assia divorced Lipsey; she married Wevill in 1960.\n\nAssia was linguistically gifted. She had a successful career in advertising and was an aspiring poet who published, under her maiden name Assia Gutmann, an English translation of the work of Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai.\n\nIn 1961, poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath rented their flat in Chalcot Square, Primrose Hill, London, to Assia and David Wevill, and took up residence at North Tawton, Devon. Hughes was immediately struck with Assia, as she was with him. He later wrote:\n\nPlath noted their chemistry. Soon afterward, Ted and Assia began an affair. At the time of Plath's suicide, Assia was pregnant with Hughes's child, but she had an abortion soon after Plath's death. The actual relationship, who instigated it, and its circumstances, have been hotly debated for many years.\n\nAfter Plath's suicide, Hughes moved Assia into Court Green (the Devon home at North Tawton he had bought with Plath), where Assia helped care for Hughes's and Plath's two children, Frieda and Nicholas. Assia was reportedly haunted by Plath's memory; she even began using things that had once belonged to Plath. In their biography of Wevill, \"Lover of Unreason\", Koren and Negev maintain that she used Plath's items not from obsession, but for the sake of practicality since she was maintaining a household for Hughes and his children. On 3 March 1965, at age 37, Wevill gave birth to Alexandra Tatiana Elise, nicknamed Shura, while still married to David Wevill.\n\nOstracized by her lover's friends and family, and eclipsed by the figure of Plath in public life, Assia became anxious and suspicious of Hughes's infidelity, which was real enough. Hughes began affairs with Brenda Hedden, a married acquaintance who frequented their home, and Carol Orchard, a nurse 20 years his junior, whom he would later marry in 1970. Assia's relationship with Hughes was also fraught with other complexities, as shown by a collection of his letters to her acquired by Emory University. She was continually distraught by his reluctance to marry her and establish a home together, as well as his treatment of her as a \"housekeeper\". While he never publicly claimed Shura as his daughter, his sister Olwyn said that she believed the child was his.\n\nOn 23 March 1969, Assia killed herself and four-year-old Shura in their London home at 3 Okeover Manor, Clapham Common. She had first sealed the kitchen door and window, then dissolved sleeping pills in a glass of water, chased with whisky, and then turned on the gas stove. She and Shura were found by the family's German au pair, Else Ludwig, lying together on a mattress in the kitchen.\n\nAssia composed the 90-second \"Lost Island\" advertisement for \"Sea Witches\" ladies' hair-dye product for both television and cinemas, called a \"breakthrough in type\" and a \"huge success\" by her biographers, Koren and Negev, that was \"applauded in theaters.\" The advert can be viewed in some classic ad compilations or sometimes as an online posting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966881", "title": "Live 8", "text": "Live 8\n\nLive 8 was a string of benefit concerts that took place on 2 July 2005, in the G8 states and in South Africa. They were timed to precede the G8 conference and summit held at the Gleneagles Hotel in Auchterarder, Scotland from 6–8 July 2005. Both events also coincided with the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. Run in support of the aims of the UK's Make Poverty History campaign and the Global Call to Action Against Poverty, ten simultaneous concerts were held on 2 July and one on 6 July. On 7 July, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to US$50 billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa.\n\nMore than 1,000 musicians performed at the concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks.\n\nLive Aid organiser Bob Geldof announced the event on 31 May. Many former Live Aid acts offered their services to the cause. Prior to the official announcement of the event, many news sources referred to the event as Live Aid 2. However, Geldof and co-organiser Midge Ure have since explicitly said they do not think of the event as the same as Live Aid. On an episode of BBC Two music-based comedy panel show \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", which aired on 2 March 2006, The Cribs frontman Ryan Jarman said he had texted Geldof to suggest that a \"Live Aid 2\" would be a good idea. However, after organising the event, Geldof said: \"This is not Live Aid 2. These concerts are the start point for The Long Walk To Justice, the one way we can all make our voices heard in unison.\". Many of the Live 8 backers were also involved in the largely forgotten NetAid concerts, including Executive Producer Jeff Pollack.\n\nOrganisers of Live 8 presented the \"Live 8 List\" to the world leaders at the Live 8 call that politicians take action to \"Make Poverty History\". Names from the list also appeared on the giant televisions at each concert during the broadcast.\n\nAn official Live 8 DVD set was released on 7 November 2005 internationally and 8 November 2005 in the United States. It was released almost a year to the day after the release of the DVD of Live Aid on 8 November 2004.\n\nBroadcaster Jonathan Ross opened the European Live 8 concerts with the words: \"It's two o'clock in London on July the 2nd 2005. Hyde Park welcomes the world to Live 8.\"\n\nThere were ten concerts held on 2 July 2005, most of them simultaneously. The first to begin was held at the Makuhari Messe in Japan, with Rize being the first of all the Live 8 performers. During the opening of the Philadelphia concert outside the city's Museum of Art, actor Will Smith led the combined audiences of London, Philadelphia, Berlin, Rome, Paris and Barrie in a synchronised finger snap, meant to represent the death of a child every three seconds in Africa.\n\nBob Geldof hosted the event at Hyde Park in London, England where he also performed \"I Don't Like Mondays\". Special guests appeared throughout the concerts. Then-Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates made speeches at the London show, while former South African President Nelson Mandela addressed the crowd in the Johannesburg venue. Guest presenters, ranging from sports stars to comedians, also introduced acts.\n\nIncluded in the all-star line-up were Pink Floyd, reunited with former frontman Roger Waters for the first time in over 24 years. With the death of keyboardist Richard Wright in 2008, Live 8 was the final time the band's \"classic\" lineup performed together. The band dedicated \"Wish You Were Here\" to their absent former member Syd Barrett, who later died in 2006.\n\nThe final event called Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push was held at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, Scotland on 6 July 2005. It featured further performances from some of the artists from the other concerts, and was the closest of the eleven to the actual location of the G8 summit.\n\n\nAlthough the concerts were free, 66,500 pairs of tickets for the Hyde Park concert were allocated from 13 to 15 June 2005, to winners of a mobile phone text message competition that began on Monday, 6 June 2005. Entry involved sending the answer to a multiple choice question via a text message costing £1.50. Winners were drawn at random from those who correctly answered the question. Over two million messages were sent during the competition, raising £3 million. The first £1.6 million raised was given to the Prince's Trust, which had to cancel its own annual Party in the Park concert in Hyde Park that year to make way for Live 8. According to the Live 8 website, funds raised beyond the £1.6 million \"will go to pay for the costs of Live 8, as it is a free event\".\n\nSome ticket-winners placed their tickets for sale on internet auction site eBay, and were heavily criticised by the organisers of the event, including Bob Geldof. Initially, eBay defended its decision to allow the auctions to go ahead, stating that there were no laws against the resale of charity concert tickets. The site also offered to make a donation to Live 8 at least equivalent to the fees it would make from the ticket sales. Some people, angered by others seemingly using Live 8 to make money, placed fake bids for millions of pounds for such auctions in an attempt to force the sellers to take them off sale. It was later announced that eBay, under pressure from the British government, the public, as well as Geldof himself, would withdraw all auctions of the tickets.\n\nSimilar touting situations arose for the Edinburgh and Canadian shows, and eBay also halted the sales of the tickets.\n\n\n\nDeep Purple made an appearance and performed \"Highway Star\", \"Smoke on the Water\" and \"Hush\". DMC (of Run-DMC) performed with Elliot Easton of The Cars, and Joey Kraemer and Tom Hamilton of Aerosmith. The Tragically Hip played a set, just before Neil Young finished off Live 8 in Barrie with \"4 Strong Winds\", \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and \"O Canada\".\n\nSome of the highlights of the Berlin show included Brian Wilson who played a set with his band, doing \"Our Prayer\"/\"Gee\", \"God Only Knows\", \"California Girls\", \"Good Vibrations\", and \"Fun Fun Fun\", as well as Green Day, having released their political rock opera \"American Idiot\" the previous year.\n\nAgata Khristy, By-2, Jango, Dolphin, Linda, Moral codex, Red Elvises, Splin, Pet Shop Boys\n\nOn 2 July, the same day as the Live 8 concerts, a rally and protest march was held in central Edinburgh, the nearest major city to the Gleneagles venue for the G8 conference later that week. This protest was organised by the Make Poverty History coalition as part of a series of events ahead of the G8 conference, and had already been planned before the announcement of Live 8.\n\nAn estimated 225,000 people took part, making it the largest ever protest in Scotland and the largest ever anti-poverty protest in the UK.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Live 8, British newspaper \"Daily Mirror\" began a petition, garnering support for British rock band Status Quo to play at the event. Originally offered a 6pm slot, the band already had commitments in Ireland and therefore requested an earlier slot. Their request was rejected by the organisers as there were no available slots.\n\nThere were speculations by the press that English girl group the Spice Girls would reunite for a Live 8 performance, in what would have been their first appearance as a five-piece since May 1998. At the Live 8 launch in May, Bob Geldof confirmed that organisers were trying to get the group to reform for the event. Ultimately, the Live 8 reunion did not materialise due to a holdout by Spice Girl Mel B. During the Hyde Park concert, British comedian Peter Kay jokingly introduced the Spice Girls while he was introducing The Who.\n\nEnglish rock band Oasis also declined to participate in the concerts as they were performing at the City of Manchester Stadium the same evening and the day after. Noel Gallagher later expressed disapproval that musicians were expected to rally at the convenience of Geldof. Gallagher was also vocally sceptical about the impact of Live 8, citing his belief that rock stars did not have as much influence over world leaders as the Live 8 organisers may believe.\n\nEnglish rock band Radiohead also turned down an offer to play at the event.\n\nThe original lineup for the Hyde Park concert faced criticism for having only one ethnic minority artist – Mariah Carey. Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn called the lack of black performers the organisers' \"greatest oversight\", while Senegalese musician Baaba Maal wrote in \"The Independent\": \"I do feel it's very patronising as an African artist that more of us aren't involved.\"\n\nLive 8 organisers subsequently added British R&B singer Ms. Dynamite, US rapper Snoop Dogg and Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour to the Hyde Park lineup in response to the criticism. N'Dour was the only major African artist scheduled to perform at any of the five main concerts. A Live 8 spokesman said that a number of black performers had been approached but were not available to participate and that the event would nonetheless feature a \"large urban element\". Organisers also argued that there were few black British artists who could attract a large global audience, stating that Geldof's intention was to aim for the biggest global stars to ensure media attention and a large television audience. A Live 8 concert in Johannesburg and an \"Africa Calling\" concert featuring an entirely African lineup at the Eden Project in Cornwall, were organised following the criticisms.\n\nGeldof's motives for organising Live 8 were questioned. TV and radio presenter Andy Kershaw directed criticisms at Geldof and the motives for Live 8, saying: \"I am coming, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Live 8 is as much to do with Geldof showing off his ability to push around presidents and prime ministers as with pointing out the potential of Africa. Indeed, Geldof appears not to be interested in Africa's strengths, only in an Africa on its knees.\" Rashod Ollison of \"The Baltimore Sun\" echoed Kershaw's criticisms, calling the event a \"ravenous orgy of celebrity ego trips\". Geldof's approach, of pressuring G8 leaders to improve aid, forgive debt and ease trade restrictions in Africa, was questioned by John O'Shea, chief executive of international aid charity Goal. O'Shea was concerned that \"Live 8 overlooked the need to tackle Africa's corrupt regimes and establish a UN peacekeeping army in Darfur, the Congo and northern Uganda.\"\n\nThe organisers were criticised for using Africa to revive the careers of ageing rock stars more than about helping the poor in Africa. The lineup for the Canada Live 8 concert in particular, was criticised for being \"out of touch\" and filled with \"musical has-beens\". \n\nFor the Edinburgh concert, Geldof called for children to \"give up home and school for a week\" to join supporters in a march (entitled The Long Walk to Justice) on 6 July, the start of the G8 summit, which drew the ire of teachers and local residents. Furthermore, the Live 8 concert's timing coincided with the long planned Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh.\n\nDamon Albarn suggested that the performers should put pressure on their record labels to pay \"some kind of tariff\" from the increased record sales that would come from playing at the event, so as to \"genuinely show this is an altruistic act and that there is no self-gain in it\". Pink Floyd's guitarist David Gilmour announced that he would donate the profits from the increased sales in Pink Floyd's album to charity, stating: \"Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives.\"\n\nCriticism was levelled at the Philadelphia Live 8 concert, when it was revealed that while the performers received no monetary compensation for their participation, they were given gift bags containing designer gifts worth about $12,000. The gifts included $2,000 Gibson guitars, $3,500 Hugo Boss suits and $6,000 Bertolucci watches.\n\nDespite the show being broadcast before the watershed in the United Kingdom, there was no attempt at censorship by the \"BBC\". The network came under fire for its coverage of the Live 8 concerts due to the amount of live swearing by several performers that was broadcast before the watershed. Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Razorlight, Green Day, U2 and Velvet Revolver were also criticised for their use of foul language during their performances. An investigation by the UK media regulator Ofcom ruled that television audiences were subjected to \"the most offensive language\" and demanded that the \"BBC\" issue an on-air apology.\n\nIn the United States, \"ABC\" drew criticism from the Parents Television Council when its delayed airing of the Hyde Park concert highlights failed to censor The Who's performance of \"Who Are You\" which contained the lyric, \"Who the fuck are you?\". \"ABC\" responded: \"Unfortunately, one inappropriate phrase sung by one performer was initially missed and made it into the East Coast network feed. It was subsequently edited out of the West Coast feed.\"\n\n\"MTV\" and \"VH1\" were criticised for their coverage of the Live 8 concerts. Media critics and viewers complained that the networks focused too little on the actual musical performances, pointing to the frequent switching between artists and concerts, and cutting to commercials, interviews or \"educational segments\" while bands were still performing. The VJs also received criticism for frequently talking over the performances. The following weekend, \"MTV\" and \"VH1\" re-aired ten commercial-free hours of music performances from the Live 8 concerts in response to the criticism.\n\nThe London concert also received criticism when alcohol was outlawed for concertgoers, but made available for the VIPs.\n\nOn 2 July 2006, BBC One, CTV and MTV broadcast \"Live 8: What a Difference a Day Makes\". In the UK, the special was 60 minutes as compared to the US version on MTV running at 90 minutes. The special was aired on MTV at 07:30 Eastern time, giving nearly no chance for viewers to be made aware of the broadcast. Instead of airing the special late at night, MTV aired their normal broadcasting schedule for Sundays, again adding to the criticism of MTV's lack of interest in Live 8.\n\nThe Live 8 on AOL worldwide multi-feed webcast by America Online won the first Emmy Award for content delivered via the Internet, cellphones, and iPods (\"Broadband award\"). Live 8 on AOL was chosen as the winner out of 74 entrants.\n\nIn a report issued in June 2006, the G8 have reportedly not lived up to their promises set in 2005. According to DATA, the US, U.K., Italy, and France increased their development-assistance pledges and actual aid to Africa in 2005, but Germany maintained its former level of contribution and Canada decreased aid in 2005. In general, the G8 is moving slowly in the effort to meet its promises.\n\nSome consider Live 8 to be a success, including Bob Geldof himself. However, others including the World Socialist Web Site dismissed Live 8 as a \"public relations stunt\" for G8 leaders and multinational corporations, due to the disparity between the rhetoric of the events and the actual efforts made after the events in reducing poverty. Geldof also believes that public attention was quickly diverted by the London bombings on 7 July 2005, the day after Live 8 Edinburgh which was the final concert in the series.\n\n"}

Besides having studied in London and Harvard, he had a Doctor of Laws from the University of Paris and Doctor of Political Science from the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International Studies. After military service in 1939-43, he joined the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and traveled across wartime Europe, negotiating prisoner-of-war exchanges and food relief assistance. After the war, he joined the Swiss federal government, and after service in Washington and London he began to work on trade issues as the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\nMr. Long helped keep the Western world moving toward freer trade in the 1970s despite protectionist pressures brought on by soaring oil prices, inflation and recession. \n\nAs director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade from 1968 to 1980, Mr. Long helped to bring about the largest reductions in tariffs since World War II. GATT, an organization based in Geneva, was created in 1948 to oversee international trade.\n\nMr. Long was the second director general of GATT, taking over from Eric Wyndham White, who had run the organization for the first 20 years of its existence. At first he was reluctant to take the job, since doing so meant giving up his post as Switzerland's ambassador to Britain and Malta, which he had accepted in 1967.\n\nRepresentatives of the leading industrial nations met at a 1973 summit meeting in Tokyo, setting off a six-year free-trade effort that became known as the Tokyo Round. These were difficult years for proponents of free trade. When oil prices quadrupled at the end of 1973—a consequence of actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries—the twin shocks of recession and inflation rippled through the world economy. National currencies became exceptionally unstable.\n\nIndustries everywhere pleaded with their governments for protection against foreign competitors. Yet Mr. Long managed to hold the world's democratic industrial governments, as well as some 20 developing countries, to the free trade commitments they had made at the start of negotiations.\n\nNot only did many tariffs drop, the Tokyo Round also represented the most comprehensive effort until then to eliminate or control other sorts of trade barriers, like quotas and export subsidies.\n\nIn 1995, at the conclusion of another trade-liberalizing exercise known as the Uruguay Round, GATT's role in governing world commerce was assumed by the World Trade Organization, a new and more powerful institution.\n\nBecause of his close personal ties with many leading French politicians Mr. Long became an intermediary between Charles de Gaulle's government in Paris and the Algerian National Liberation Front. He helped set up the talks that eventually led to the Evian agreements of 1962, which ended the Algerian war.\n\nMr. Long returned to commercial diplomacy, playing a prominent role in negotiations that led to creation of the European Free Trade Association, a trading bloc set up in 1959 by seven European countries that did not wish to join the six-nation European Community, or Common Market.\n\nMr. Long was also a Professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. He was the author of several books and articles on economic affairs and political science. \n\nHe is survived by his wife, the former Francine Roels, whom he married in 1946, and by two daughters and a son, Dr. Eric Long . \n\n"}

It takes four minutes for trains to travel between Clementi and Jurong East stations.\n\nThe station is also directly linked to the Clementi Mall and Clementi Bus Interchange. Together, they form the Clementi Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).\n\nConstruction of the Clementi MRT station began on May 1985 after the awarding of the Contract 204 to LKN-Aoki venture and was completed on December 1987.\n\nClementi station opened on 12 March 1988, which is part of the Phase 1B of the MRT line. It travels from Outram Park to Clementi. This station is painted light blue.\n\nOn 5 August 1993, at around 7.53 am, two trains collided in the station. It appeared that one train had stopped at the station for longer than usual after experiencing a technical fault, and then a second westward train hit the first. 156 commuters were injured, many of whom were on their way to work. Eight were admitted to three hospitals, while the rest received outpatient treatment.\n\nA four-member independent panel was subsequently formed by SMRT to conduct an inquiry into the accident. The panel was chaired by Chua Koon Hoe, deputy director-general of the Public Works Department of Singapore, with the members Chang Meng Teng, deputy chairman of the Public Transport Council, and Dr. Natarajan Varaprasad, principal of Temasek Polytechnic. Low Tien Sio, SMRTC's general manager (project administration) served as the secretary.\n\nThe results of the inquiry were announced by the SMRTC on 19 October 1993. Shortly after the accident The Straits Times had reported that an oil spill on the tracks was responsible for the second train's inability to brake in time. Some 50 litres of oil had spilled from a locomotive doing maintenance work on the track in the pre-dawn hours of 5 August. SMRT staff had been alerted to the spill and had dispatched a cleaning crew to the neighbouring Buona Vista, but approval to access the tracks was delayed. Already ten trains had reported difficulty braking on the track that morning. The 11th train had to use its emergency brakes upon reaching Clementi station, and while it was waiting for the brakes to be recharged so that it could move off again, the 12th approached the station and could not brake in time to avoid hitting the 11th train.\n\nThe Communications Minister at that time, Mah Bow Tan, said that as the SMRT staff followed procedures and none were found to be negligent, so no staff would be punished. However SMRT promised to look into the problem of oil spillage from maintenance locomotives by replacing the hoses and oil seals on all locomotives, checking all locomotives for leaks upon their return to depots, and assigning a station master to inspect tracks for oil. Procedures were also amended so that trains would not move off from stations preceding the spill until it had been cleaned up.\n\nAs with most of the stations along the East West Line, it was initially built without platform screen doors which prevents commuters from falling onto the train tracks. After several successful tests at Jurong East, Yishun and Pasir Ris, eventually, installation of the half-height screen doors started on 19 April 2010 and operations commenced on 16 August 2010. It was the 4th above-ground station to have Half-Height Platform Screen Doors installed and in operation with Bukit Gombak. Also, the station has been installed with high-volume low-speed fans, which commenced operations on 3 October 2012.\n\nPrivacy screens were installed from Clementi MRT station to Clementi Avenue 2 and Clementi Avenue 1 to Clementi Road to minimise the impact of noise from residents. Installation works began in September 2016.\n\nTogether with Queenstown and Commonwealth stations, this station will see the construction of an additional overhead bridge linking the station to two new exits, which goes to the same side as the previous exit. Construction started in mid-2012 and opened on 25 August 2015.\n\nOn 17 January 2013, a new railway line was announced. The Cross Island MRT line is a 50 km rail that stretches between Changi and Jurong. It was reported to pass towns such as Loyang, Pasir Ris, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Timah, West Coast and Clementi along the way. It will have interchange stations with all the current radial lines.\n\nClementi is one of the stations to be an interchange with the Cross Island Line.\n"}

{"id": "1966906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966906", "title": "Interstellar Overdrive", "text": "Interstellar Overdrive\n\n\"Interstellar Overdrive\" is an instrumental composition written and performed by Pink Floyd. The song was written in 1966 and is on their 1967 debut album, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\", clocking in at almost ten minutes in length.\n\nThe song originated when guitarist Syd Barrett heard the band's manager Peter Jenner humming a song, which Barrett tried to interpret by playing it on his guitar. Sharing the same emphasis on chromaticism with \"Astronomy Domine\", the piece was recorded in several takes during March and April of 1967. An earlier, longer recording of the song can be heard on the soundtrack to the film \"Tonite Lets All Make Love in London\", which was recorded at Sound Technique Studios in early 1967 and was released in the same year. Other versions of the track appear on various bootleg recordings. The piece has been covered by acts such as T. Rex, Pearl Jam, Hawkwind, the Melvins, and Simon House.\n\n\"Interstellar Overdrive\" was one of the very first psychedelic instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band. It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with \"Astronomy Domine\"), although band members would later disparage this term. It has also been described as an experimental rock and psychedelic rock song as well as an example of proto-prog. \"Interstellar Overdrive\" originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying to hum a song he could not remember the name of (most commonly identified as Love's cover of \"My Little Red Book\"). Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett followed Jenner's humming with his guitar and used it as the basis for the principal melody of \"Interstellar Overdrive\". Bassist Roger Waters once told Barrett that the song's riff reminded him of the theme tune from \"Steptoe and Son\" (by Ron Grainer). Around the time the song was written, Barrett was also inspired by AMM and their guitarist Keith Rowe, who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar's fretboard. The free-form section (and also, \"Pow R. Toc H.\") was inspired by Frank Zappa's free-form freak-out and The Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\".\n\n\"Interstellar Overdrive\" shares an emphasis on chromaticism with \"Astronomy Domine\". The main theme descends chromatically from B to G, before resolving to E, all chords major. The opening hook of the piece is a distorted, descending guitar riff, played by Barrett, its composer, with Waters on bass and Richard Wright on organ. Nick Mason's drums then kick in, and after the riff repeats itself a bit, the track turns into improvisation, including modal improvisations, flourishes on the Farfisa organ, and quiet interludes. The song gradually becomes almost structureless and in free-form tempo, punctuated only by strange guitar noises. Eventually, however, the entire band restates the main theme, which is repeated with decreasing tempo and more deliberate intensity. Waters once called the song \"an abstract piece\". A bass riff in the song later evolved into another Pink Floyd song, \"Let There Be More Light\", which was written by Waters.\n\nThe stereo version of the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono version of the song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very prominent during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, in an attempt to create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year. The \"Piper\" version also appears on the official compilation albums \"Relics\" and \"A Nice Pair\". Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for \"Interstellar Overdrive\", as Jenner recalled: \"It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit . . . and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that.\" A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song near the very end.\n\nThe studio recording on \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" is the one that most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage. It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966, recorded live-in-studio at Thompson Private Recording Company. This version was used as the audio sound to the film \"San Francisco\", which was made by a friend of Barrett's, Anthony Stern. While filmmaker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion, the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern, to which Whitehead told him, \"yeah, terrible music\". Stern said that \"they're successful now\", and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd, at their gig at the Royal College of Art. Whitehead recalled that they \"went to UFO and I liked them. Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality, ideal for what I wanted.\" Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record \"Interstellar Overdrive\" for a film he was working on. Before turning up at the recording studio, the band held a rehearsal, and the next day, 11 January 1967, went to Sound Techniques studios. The studio, which was originally a dairy factory, was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood.\n\nFor the session, which was booked for two hours, Wood and Joe Boyd operated the mixing desk, while Whitehead and Stern were filming. This recording of the song lasted nearly 16-minutes in length, recorded onto a 4-track recorder in one take, as the band didn't want to have to play through the song again. The band then played another original instrumental, titled \"Nick's Boogie\". While 5 seconds of the band playing was included in Whitehead's \"Tonite Lets All Make Love in London\" film, edits of the recording was included on the film's respective soundtrack. The soundtrack (released in 1968) includes an edited version of the song and two reprises of it. The full version is available on the album \"London '66–'67\". While attempting to get the band a record deal, Boyd returned with the group to Sound Techniques studios. There, Boyd and the band recorded a demo tape which was to be given to various record labels, one of the songs that features on the tape was \"Interstellar Overdrive\". An early, unoverdubbed, shortened mix of the album's \"Interstellar Overdrive\" was used for a French EP released in July 1967. The 40th anniversary edition of \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" contains two different, five-minute-long versions of the song, one of them being take 6 from 16 March.\n\nDespite its encapsulation of their concert repertoire under the leadership of guitarist and composer Barrett, the long, improvisational, freeform structure of the piece is not particularly representative of the group's recorded output. As drummer Mason states in his book \"\", live versions of the song featured many sections that did not appear on the album, and would often last more than 20 minutes. During the band's days playing in residence at London underground clubs such as the UFO (Underground Freak Out), the song usually opened their show. It occupied other positions, including the encore, until it was retired from the band's setlist in 1970. The song had first appeared in live performances in the autumn of 1966. During one performance of the song, at a gig organized by Hoppy Hopkins, Pink Floyd managed to blow out the power of a venue. Hopkins called it \"Very cold, very dirty but very nice.\" After recording session for \"Piper\" were over, Pink Floyd played a 30-minute version of \"Interstellar Overdrive\". Pink Floyd were filmed performing the song for Granada Television's \"Scene Special documentary\", in January 1967 at the UFO Club. A late-Barrett era rendition was recorded live in Rotterdam in November 1967, at the Hippy-Happy Fair. The song was later replaced by \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" as the main part of the band's set lists, after Barrett left the band. A version of \"Interstellar Overdrive\" was cut from the \"Ummagumma\" live album. The song was played by Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets in 2018.\n\nIn 1969, Frank Zappa joined the band onstage at the Actuel Festival in Amougies, Belgium, to perform a long loose version of the song. Although Zappa himself later had no recollection of the performance, Floyd drummer Mason praised him saying \"Zappa is really one of those rare musicians that can play with us. The little he did in Amougies was terribly correct.\"\n\nThe song has been released in many different lengths across different releases, original 1967 \"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" releases have the track at , whilst the edited 1968 \"Tonite Let's All Make Love in London\" version clocks in at . This same recording was released in its entirety twice, first on the 1990 reissue of the album, and then again in 1995 on the EP London '66-'67 clocking in at . The earliest studio recording of the song to be released was the 1966 recording with a running time of and was released in 2017 on the \"Interstellar Overdrive\" single.

One of the best documented cases of collapse or near collapse is the Great Depression, the causes of which are still being debated.\n\"To understand the Great Depression is the Holy Grail of macroeconomics.\" —Ben Bernanke (1995)\n\nBernanke's comment addresses the difficulty of identifying specific causes when many factors may each have contributed to various extents.\n\nPast economic collapses have had political as well as financial causes. Persistent trade deficits, wars, revolutions, famines, depletion of important resources, and government-induced hyperinflation have been listed as causes.\n\nIn some cases blockades and embargoes caused severe hardships that could be considered economic collapse. In the U.S. the Embargo Act of 1807 forbade foreign trade with warring European nations, causing a severe depression in the heavily international trade-dependent economy, especially in the shipping industry and port cities, ending a great boom. The Union blockade of the Confederate States of America severely damaged the South's plantation owners; however, the South had little economic development. The blockade of Germany during World War I led to starvation of hundreds of thousands of Germans but did not cause economic collapse, at least until the political turmoil and the hyperinflation that followed. For both the Confederacy and Weimar Germany, the cost of the war was worse than the blockade. Many Southern plantation owners had their bank accounts confiscated and also all had to free their slaves without compensation. The Germans had to make war reparations.\n\nFollowing defeat in war, the conquering country or faction may not accept paper currency of the vanquished, and the paper becomes worthless. (This was the situation of the Confederacy.) Government debt obligations, primarily bonds, are often restructured and sometimes become worthless. Therefore, there is a tendency for the public to hold gold and silver during times of war or crisis.\n\nHyperinflation, wars, and revolutions cause hoarding of essentials and a disruption of markets. In some past hyperinflations, workers were paid daily and immediately spent their earnings on essential goods, which they often used for barter. Store shelves were frequently empty.\n\nMore stable foreign currencies, silver and gold (usually coins) were held and exchanged in place of local currency. The minting country of precious metal coins tended to be relatively unimportant. Jewelry was also used as a medium of exchange. Alcoholic beverages were also used for barter.\n\nDesperate individuals sold valuable possessions to buy essentials or traded them for gold and silver.\n\nIn the German hyperinflation, stocks held much more of their value than paper currency. Bonds denominated in the inflating currency may lose most or all value.\n\nDuring severe financial crises, sometimes governments close banks. Depositors may be unable to withdraw their money for long periods, as was true in the United States in 1933 under the Emergency Banking Act. Withdrawals may be limited. Bank deposits may be involuntarily converted to government bonds or to a new currency of lesser value in foreign exchange.\n\nDuring financial crises and even less severe situations, capital controls are often imposed to restrict or prohibit transferring or personally taking money, securities or other valuables out of a country. To end hyperinflations a new currency is typically issued. The old currency is often not worth exchanging for new.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion followed by internal warfare, famines and epidemics caused the deaths of over 100 million and greatly reduced the economy.\n\nFollowing Germany's defeat in World War I, political instability resulted in murders and assassinations of hundreds of political figures. (See: German Revolution of 1918–1919 and Kapp Putsch) \n\nGermany's finances were heavily strained by the war and reparations in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, leaving the government unable to raise enough taxation to operate and make war reparations. The government resorted to printing money to cover the shortfall, which resulted in major hyperinflation; one book on these events, which includes quotes and a few first hand accounts, is \"When Money Dies\". The hyperinflation ended in December 1923, with government debt being cleared at the cost of ordinary citizens' savings.\n\nSome believe that the hyperinflation of 1923 helped fuel the eventual rise of the Nazi party, and the rise of Hitler to power in 1933. Economists, however, tend to attribute Hitler's rise to the Deflation and the Great Depression beginning in 1929. Paul Krugman concluded that the 1923 hyperinflation didn’t bring Hitler to power, but the Brüning deflation and depression. \nBefore 1929, the Nazi party had been actually in decline, receiving less than 3% of votes in the German federal election in 1928 (see election results of the Nazi Party).\n\nWhile arguably not a true economic collapse, the decade of the 1930s witnessed the most severe worldwide economic contraction since the start of the Industrial Revolution. In the US, the Depression began in the summer of 1929, soon followed by the stock market crash of October 1929. American stock prices continued to decline in fits and starts until they hit bottom in July 1932. In the first quarter of 1933, the banking system broke down: asset prices had collapsed, bank lending had largely ceased, a quarter of the American work force was unemployed, and real GDP per capita in 1933 was 29% below its 1929 value. The ensuing rapid recovery was interrupted by a major recession in 1937–38. The USA fully recovered by 1941, the eve of its entry in World War II, which gave rise to a boom as dramatic as the Depression that preceded it.\n\nWhile there were numerous bank failures during the Great Depression, most banks in developed countries survived, as did most currencies and governments. The most significant monetary change during the depression was the demise of the gold standard by most nations that were on it. In the U.S., the dollar was redeemable in gold until 1933 when U.S. citizens were forced to turn over their gold (except for 5 ounces) for fiat currency (See: Executive Order 6102) and were forbidden to own monetary gold for the next four decades. Subsequently, gold was revalued from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce. U.S. dollars remained redeemable in gold by foreigners until 1971. Gold ownership was legalized in the U.S. in 1974, but not with legal tender status.\n\nAs bad as the Great Depression was, it took place during a period of high productivity growth, which caused real wages to rise. The high unemployment was partly a result of the productivity gains, allowing the number of hours of the standard work week to be cut while restoring economic output to previous levels after a few years. Workers who remained employed saw their real hourly earnings rise because wages remained constant while prices fell; however, overall earnings remained relatively constant because of the reduced work week. Converting the dollar to a fiat currency and devaluing against gold ensured the end of deflation and created inflation, which made the high debt accumulated during the 1920s boom easier to repay, although some of the debt was written off.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Eastern Bloc, which relied on a stagnant form of planned economy, experienced a decade-long period of stagflation, and eventual collapse from which it did not recover, culminating with revolutions and the fall of communist regimes throughout Central and Eastern Europe and eventually in the Soviet Union. The process was accompanied by a gradual but important easing of restrictions on economic and political behaviour in the late 1980s, including the satellite states.\n\nThe collapse in the USSR was characterized by an increase in the death rate, especially by men over 50, with alcoholism a major cause. There was also an increase in violent crime and murder. The Russian population peaked in the 1990s and is lower today than two decades ago, as the demographics of Russia show.\n\nA firsthand account of conditions during the economic collapse was told by Dmitry Orlov, a former USSR citizen who became a US citizen but returned to Russia for a time during the crisis.\n\nAfter more or less stabilizing after the disintegration of the USSR, a severe financial crisis took place in the Russian Federation in August 1998. It was caused by low oil prices and government expenditure cuts after the end of the Cold War. Other nations of the former Soviet Union also experienced economic collapse, although a number of crises also involved armed conflicts, like in the break-away region Chechnya. The default by Russia on its government bonds in 1998 led to the collapse of highly leveraged hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, which threatened the world financial system. The U.S. Federal Reserve organized a bailout of LTCM which turned it over to a banking consortium.\n\nThe depression, which began after the Russian and Brazilian financial crises, caused widespread unemployment, riots, the fall of the government, a default on the country's foreign debt, the rise of alternative currencies and the end of the peso's fixed exchange rate to the US dollar. The economy shrank by 28 percent from 1998 to 2002. In terms of income, over 50 percent of Argentines were poor and 25 percent, indigent; seven out of ten Argentine children were poor at the depth of the crisis in 2002.\n\nBy the end of November 2001, people began withdrawing large sums of dollars from their bank accounts, turning pesos into dollars, and sending them abroad, which caused a bank run.\n\nThe freeze enraged many Argentines who took to the streets of important cities, especially Buenos Aires. They engaged in protests.\n\nThe president De la Rúa eventually fled the Casa Rosada in a helicopter on 21 December 2001.\n\nIn Latvia, GDP declined more than 20% from 2008 to 2010, one of the worst recessions on record.\nIn Greece, GDP declined more than 26% starting in 2008.\n\nSince 2013, Venezuela has been suffering an economic crisis. It's the worst in Venezuelan history, caused by the economic policies of the president, Nicolás Maduro the successor of Hugo Chávez, the fall in oil prices and internal and external factors. Since 2014, Venezuela's GDP has been in recession, falling more 40%. The economy has collapsed, causing shortages of basics goods, economic downturn and hyperinflation since 2017. Also, there are drastic increases in the crime, corruption, poverty and hunger. Thousands of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries.\n\nSome economists (i.e. the Austrian School, in particular Ludwig von Mises), believe that government intervention and over-regulation of the economy can lead to the conditions for collapse. In particular, Austrian theoretical research has been focused on such problems emanating from socialist forms of economic organization. This however is not a theory of economic collapse involving the breakdown of freely functioning financial markets; rather, the focus is on economic malfunction and crisis emanating from state control.\n\nHowever, many Austrian economists also subscribe to what is called the \"ABCT\", or Austrian Business Cycle Theory. Economist Roger Garrison describes the bubble as merely a form of unsustainable boom (not a theory of all depression), as Mises and F.A. Hayek did, despite their disagreements on the exact workings of it. The essential part of the theory is that it is inherently unsustainable to try to manipulate monetary policy to boost both investment and consumption; usually through interest rate manipulation and bond-buying and such. The \"boom\" was created by \"malinvestments,\" as Mises called them; business decisions that are bad investments and unsustainable in the long run because lowering interest rates by padding the supply of money and credit will only work in the short-term, but will ultimately collapse because the government can only hold down interest rates so long before fear of inflation kicks in (and deflation comes at the peak of the business cycle), or they go into hyperinflation (which is completely outside the realm of the ABCT).\n\nRomanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics, has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth—that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself.\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:\nTaken together, the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return overshoot-and-collapse trajectory with regard to the Earth's mineral stock. The world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures.\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating Earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when mankind will ultimately face extinction. In effect, \"any\" conceivable intertemporal allocation of the finite stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point. \n\nExamples:\n"}

It is a direct attack on Thomas Shadwell, another prominent poet of the time. It opens with the lines:\n\nWritten about 1678, but not published until 1682 (see 1682 in poetry), \"Mac Flecknoe\" is the outcome of a series of disagreements between Thomas Shadwell and Dryden. Their quarrel blossomed from the following disagreements: \"1) their different estimates of the genius of Ben Jonson, 2) the preference of Dryden for comedy of wit and repartee and of Shadwell, the chief disciple of Jonson, for humors comedy, 3) a sharp disagreement over the true purpose of comedy, 4) contention over the value of rhymed plays, and 5) plagiarism.\" Shadwell fancied himself heir to Ben Jonson and to the variety of comedy which the latter had commonly written. Shadwell’s poetry was certainly not of the same standard as Jonson’s, and it is possible that Dryden wearied of Shadwell’s argument that Dryden undervalued Jonson. Shadwell and Dryden were separated not only by literary grounds but also by political ones as Shadwell was a Whig, while Dryden was an outspoken supporter of the Stuart monarchy.\n\nThe poem illustrates Shadwell as the heir to a kingdom of poetic dullness, represented by his association with Richard Flecknoe, an earlier poet already satirized by Andrew Marvell and disliked by Dryden, although the poet does not use belittling techniques to satirize him. Multiple allusions in the satire to 17th-century literary works, and to classic Greek and Roman literature, demonstrate Dryden’s complex approach and his mastery over the mock-heroic style.\n\nThe poem begins in the tone of an epic masterpiece, presenting Shadwell's defining characteristic as dullness, just as every epic hero has a defining characteristic: Odysseus's is cunning; Achilles's is wrath; the hero of Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" is of holiness; whilst Satan in \"Paradise Lost\" has the defining characteristic of pride. Thus, Dryden subverts the theme of the defining characteristic by giving Shadwell a negative characteristic as his only virtue. \nDryden uses the mock-heroic through his use of the heightened language of the epic to treat the trivial subjects such as poorly written and largely dismissible poetry. The juxtaposition of the lofty style with unexpected nouns such as 'dullness' provides an ironic contrast and makes the satiric point by the obvious disparity. In this, it works at the verbal level, with the language being carried by compelling rhythm and rhyme.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966920", "title": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia", "text": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia\n\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm. The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia; other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation.\n\nCDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension. Newborns with CDH often have severe respiratory distress which can be life-threatening unless treated appropriately.\n\nThe Bochdalek hernia, also known as a postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia, is the most common manifestation of CDH, accounting for more than 95% of cases. In this instance the diaphragm abnormality is characterized by a hole in the postero-lateral corner of the diaphragm which allows passage of the abdominal viscera into the chest cavity. The majority of Bochdalek hernias (80–85%) occur on the left side of the diaphragm, a large proportion of the remaining cases occur on the right side. To date, it carries a high mortality and is an active area of clinical research.\n\nThis rare anterior defect of the diaphragm is variably referred to as a Morgagni, retrosternal, or parasternal hernia. Accounting for approximately 2% of all CDH cases, it is characterized by herniation through the foramina of Morgagni which are located immediately adjacent and posterior to the xiphoid process of the sternum.\n\nThe diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic eventration is used when there is abnormal displacement (i.e. elevation) of part or all of an otherwise intact diaphragm into the chest cavity. This rare type of CDH occurs because in the region of eventration the diaphragm is thinner, allowing the abdominal viscera to protrude upwards.\n\nIt involves three major defects:\n\nThis condition can often be diagnosed before birth and fetal intervention can sometimes help, depending on the severity of the condition.\nInfants born with diaphragmatic hernia experience respiratory failure due to both pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia. The first condition is a restriction of blood flow through the lungs thought to be caused by defects in the lung. Pulmonary hypoplasia or decreased lung volume is directly related to the abdominal organs presence in the chest cavity which causes the lungs to be severely undersized, especially on the side of the hernia.\n\nSurvival rates for infants with this condition vary, but have generally been increasing through advances in neonatal medicine. Work has been done to correlate survival rates to ultrasound measurements of the lung volume as compared to the baby's head circumference. This figure known as the lung to head ratio (LHR). Still, LHR remains an inconsistent measure of survival. Outcomes of CDH are largely dependent on the severity of the defect and the appropriate timing of treatment.\n\nA small percentage of cases go unrecognized into adulthood.\n\nThe first step in management is orogastric tube placement and securing the airway (intubation). The baby will usually be immediately placed on a ventilator.\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used as part of the treatment strategy at some hospitals. ECMO acts as a baby heart-lung bypass (though it can be used for older children as well). A venous cannula is inserted into the jugular vein or the common femoral vein (ECMO is divided into two types; (arteriovenous AV and venovenous VV), allowing the blood to exit the body and begin its trek through the ECMO circuit, it is then scrubbed, oxygenated, and passes through a filter before being returned to the body via a second cannula into the baby’s own circulatory system where it makes its rounds before returning to the ECMO circuit to be oxygenated again. In essence, the ECMO circuit acts as the baby's lungs. Babies require extra blood volume and hefty doses of blood thinners in order to keep the circuit running without clot formation, which could be potentially fatal. Even though the baby is not using her lungs, an ocillating ventilator maybe still be used to keep some air in the lungs so that they do not fully collapse while not being used. During ECMO the pulmonary artery has a chance to rest, as it were, thus hopefully reducing the presence of pulmonary hypertension, one of the biggest complication of CDH cases. CDH repair can be done while the baby is on ECMO, although blood thinners increase the risk of bleeding complications. Usually surgeons prefer to perform CDH repairs off ECMO. Once the baby is taken off ECMO the carotid artery is sealed and can no longer be used. When repairing the hernia an incision is made in the abdomen. The hernia can sometimes be simply stitched closed but in more complicated cases a patch may be required. A synthetic patch can be used but will usually require replacement later as the child grows. A more natural patch can be created by slicing and folding over a section of abdominal muscle and securing it to the existing piece of diaphragm. Any organ displacement is corrected during surgery; the heart and lungs will usually move back into position on their own, once displaced organs such as bowel, liver, or stomach, are out of the way. The incision is then closed. Sometimes, the incision site will be left open to allow the body to adjust to newly moved organs and the pressure associated with that, and then closed later once swelling and drainage has decreased.\n\nDiaphragm eventration is typically repaired thoracoscopically, by a technique called plication of the diaphragm. Plication basically involves a folding of the eventrated diaphragm which is then sutured in order to “take up the slack” of the excess diaphragm tissue.\n\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia has a mortality rate of 40–62%, with outcomes being more favorable in the absence of other congenital abnormalities. Individual rates vary greatly dependent upon multiple factors: size of hernia, organs involved, additional birth defects, and/or genetic problems, amount of lung growth, age and size at birth, type of treatments, timing of treatments, complications (such as infections) and lack of lung function.\n\n"}

For her great beauty she was known as \"La Belle Stuart\" and served as the model for an idealised, female Britannia.\n\nFrances was the daughter of Walter Stewart, or Stuart, a physician in Queen Henrietta Maria's court, and a distant relative of the royal family. She was born on 8 July 1647 in exile in Paris, but was sent to England in 1663 after the restoration by Charles I's widow Henrietta Maria as maid of honour (a court appointment) and subsequently as lady-in-waiting to Charles II's new bride, Catherine of Braganza.\n\nThe great diarist Samuel Pepys recorded that she was the greatest beauty he ever saw. She had numerous suitors, including the Duke of Buckingham and Francis Digby, son of the Earl of Bristol, whose unrequited love for her was celebrated by Dryden. Her beauty appeared to her contemporaries to be equalled only by her childish silliness; but her letters to her husband, preserved in the British Museum, are not devoid of good sense and feeling.\n\nThe Count de Gramont said of her that \"it would be difficult to imagine less brain combined with more beauty.\"\n\nWhile a member of the royal court, she caught the eye of Charles II, who fell in love with her. The king's infatuation was so great that when the queen's life was despaired of in 1663, it was reported that he intended to marry Stewart, and four years later he was considering the possibility of obtaining a divorce to enable him to make her his wife because she had refused to become his mistress.\n\nEventually, in March 1667, she married (as his third wife) Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1639-1672), a 4th cousin of King Charles II, but produced no issue. It is possible she had to elope, after being discovered with him by Lady Castlemaine, a rival for the king's affections.\n\nThe now Duchess of Richmond, however, soon returned to court, where she remained for many years; and although she was disfigured by smallpox in 1669, she retained her hold on the king's affections. It is certain, at least, that Charles went on to post the Duke to Scotland and then to Denmark as ambassador, where he died in 1672.\n\nThe duchess was present in 1688 at the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart (\"The Old Pretender\"), son of James II, and was one of those who signed the certificate before the council. She died in 1702 aged 55, leaving a valuable property to her nephew Alexander Stuart, 5th Lord Blantyre, whose seat of Lethington was renamed Lennoxlove after her.\n\nFollowing the war with the Dutch, Charles had a commemorative medal cast, in which her face was used as a model for Britannia; this subsequently became customary for medals, coins and statues. She continued to appear on some of the copper coinage of the United Kingdom until the decimalization of the currency in 1971. She also appeared on the fifty pence piece in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1966992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966992", "title": "Rivers State", "text": "Rivers State\n\nRivers State, also known simply as Rivers, is one of the 36 states of Nigeria. According to census data released in 2006, the state has a population of 5,198,716, making it the sixth-most populous state in the country. Its capital and largest city, Port Harcourt, is economically significant as the centre of Nigeria's oil industry. Rivers State is bounded on the South by the Atlantic Ocean, to the North by Imo and Abia , to the East by Akwa Ibom State, and to the West by Bayelsa and Delta states. It is home of many ethnic group,majorly :Ikwerre people, Ikwerre, a subgroup of the Igbo Ethnic Group, Ijaw Subgroups, Ogoni people and many other ethnic groups. The people from Rivers State are known as \"Riverians\".\n\nThe inland part of the state consists of tropical rainforest; towards the coast, the typical Niger Delta environment features many mangrove swamps.\n\nRivers State, named after the many rivers that border its territory, was part of the Oil Rivers Protectorate from 1885 till 1893 when it became part of the Niger Coast Protectorate. In 1900, the region was merged with the chartered territories of the Royal Niger Company to form the colony of Southern Nigeria. The state was formed in 1967 with the split of the Eastern Region of Nigeria. In 1996 the state lost territory to form Bayelsa State.\n\nIn the early days of the colonial period, several protection treaties were signed between various indigenous communities and the British colonial government. Between 1941 and 1952, agitation for the creation of Rivers province began with the formation of the Ijo Rivers People's League. By 1953, the Council of Rivers Chiefs was birthed as a replacement body for the League, the same year, another organisation, the Calabar Ogoja Rivers (COR) State Movement became existent.\n\nThe Council of Rivers Chiefs was later renamed in 1954 to Rivers Chiefs and People's Congress and in 1956, the organisation became known as the Rivers Chiefs People's Conference. Until 1958, hopes of an independent state resonated with the region and lingered consistently in the minds of its natives. During the constitutional conference that year, the country's nationhood was affirmed while an agreement was reached on some measures to mitigate the fears of the ethnic minorities in the area. Around this time, the COR State Movement had broken away to press their own case. Thereafter, the British launched a commission led by Sir Henry Willink to look into the misgivings of these autochthons. The Willink Commission initiated the conception of the Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB). The purpose was to tackle the problems of underdevelopment, however, this failed to rise to the expectations of the masses. After much discontent, some of the people attempted to take the extralegal route to achieve their goals.\n\nIn February 1966, Isaac Boro, Sam Owonaro and Nottingham Dick alongside their supporters proclaimed a \"Delta People's Republic\". The rebellion was immediately crushed by the Federal and the old Eastern Nigeria government. On 27 May 1967, under the administration of General Yakubu Gowon, Decree No. 14 was issued, allowing the creation of Rivers State. From then on, complaints about political marginalisation, environmental degradation and economic pauperisation remained among the Ijaw groups, such that a separate Bayelsa State was carved out of Rivers State by the military government of Sani Abacha on 1st October,1996.\n\nRivers State is a predominantly low-lying pluvial state in southern Nigeria, located in the eastern part of the Niger Delta on the oceanward extension of the Benue Trough. The inland part of the state consists of tropical rainforest, and towards the coast, the typical Niger Delta environment features many mangrove swamps. Rivers State has a total area of 11,077 km² (4,277 mi²), making it the 26th largest state in Nigeria. Surrounding states are Imo and Abia to the north, Akwa Ibom to the east and Bayelsa, Delta to the west. On the south, it is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean. Its topography ranges from flat plains, with a network of rivers to tributaries.\n\nRainfall is generally seasonal, variable, as well as heavy, and occurs between the months of March and October through November. The wet season peaks in July, lasting more than 290 days. The only dry months are January and February having little to no effect.\n\nTotal annual rainfall decreases from about on the coast, to about in the extreme north. It is at Bonny along the coast and at Degema. For Port Harcourt, temperatures throughout the year are relatively constant with little variation throughout the course of the seasons. Average temperatures are typically between 25 °C−28 °C. Some parts of the state still receive up to of rainfall during the dry period. Relative humidity rarely dips below 60% and fluctuates between 90% and 100% for most of the year.\n\nThe land surface of Rivers State can be divided into three zones: freshwater swamps, mangrove swamps and coastal sand ridges. The freshwater zone extends northwards from the mangrove swamps. This land surface is generally less than 20m above sea level. As a lower Niger floodplain, it contains a greater silt and clay foundation and is more susceptible to perennial inundation by river floods. The floodplain's total thickness rises to about 45m in the northeast and over 9m in the beach ridge barrier zones to the southwest.\n\nOn coastal sand ridges, the soils are mostly sandy or sandy loams. Various crops are supported including coconut, oil palm, raffia palm and cocoyam. The drier upland region of Rivers State covers 61% of landmass while the riverine areas, with a relief range of 2m to 5m, take up 39%.\n\nDue to its geographical location, Rivers State has always played an important role in the natural history of Nigeria, having been found to host a vast array of wildlife and plants. Its tropical rainforests are home to more species than all other local biomes combined thanks to its climate and canopy structure. Unfortunately, some of the upland forested areas have seen disruption from human activity, impacting negatively on the biodiversity and ecological functions of natural habitats. In most places, the dominant vegetation usually consists of \"Elaeis guineensis\" which has the highest productivity amongst all recognized oleaginous crops.\n\nThe riverine part of the state has three hydro-vegetation zones such as beach ridge, salt water and fresh water. Each zone has its own characteristics and composition, with the freshwaters encompassing the upper and lower floodplains of the Niger Delta.\n\nFinima Nature Park is a protected area and forest reserve in Bonny Island covering an area of approximately 10 km² (3.9 mi²). The park's vegetation has progressively developed into a high forest considering the form from which it began in 1999. There are two storeys that can be distinguished from outside the forest, the emergents include \"Symphonia globulifera\", \"Cleistopholis patens\", \"Uapaca\" spp., \"Musanga cecropioides\", \"Hallea ledermannii\", \"Terminalia\" spp., \"Anthostema aubryanum\", \"Tectona grandis\" and \"Elaeis guineensis\". The understory is composed mainly of \"Calamus deeratus\", \"Alchornea cordifolia\", \"Monodora tenuifolia\", \"Harungana madagascariensis\", \"Strophanthus preussii\", \"Rauvolfia vomitoria\" and \"Raphia\" spp.\n\nThe interior of the forest is very shady, and as a result a wide variety of shade tolerant forbs (e.g. \"Nephrolepis biserrata\", \"Culcasia scandens\", \"Laportea\" spp., \"Chromolaena odorata\", \"Aframomum melegueta\" and \"Costus afer\") and various sedges form thickets on the forest floor. By dry season, large cushion of litter cover the floor because of increase in abscission rate of some plants such as \"Musanga cecropioides\", \"Hallea ledermannii\", \"Calamus deeratus\", \"Gmelina arborea\", \"Raphia\" spp. and \"Elaeis guineensis\".\n\nMammals, reptiles and amphibians are also found in the park. The common mammals are mona monkeys and pygmy hippopotamuses. Among the reptiles and amphibians are snakes and crocodiles, turtles, frogs, lizards, and skinks.\n\nOne of the world’s Ramsar Convention-listed wetlands, Upper Orashi Forest, is a 252 km² protected area in Ahoada West. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an IBA because of its importance to global populations of grey parrots and other birds. The Biseni Forest in the north west of Ahoada and west of Upper Orashi Forest have also been designated an Important Bird Area. The forest has an area of 219 km² within which mammals like red-bellied monkey and yellow-backed duiker are found along with raffia palms and some woody broadleaved species such as \"Symphonia globulifera\" and \"Ficus\" spp.\n\nThe state has many rivers, some of which include: \n\nOver the period from 1991 to 2006, the total population of Rivers State has increased by close to 3 million people. The last official census showed that 5,198,716 people were living in the state, of whom 2,673,026 were men and 2,525,690 were women. Adults and adolescents aged 15 to 64 years accounted for 61% of the population in the state. Children below the age of 15 accounted for 36% of the population, and those aged 65 years and above, another 3%. Port Harcourt and Obio-Akpor had the highest number of inhabitants of any local government area, while Ogu–Bolo and Omuma had the lowest. The total area of the state was 11,077 km² and the density was 635.89 inh. per km².\n\nRivers State has higher literacy rate compared to most states in the South South geopolitical zone. Its male literacy as of 2006 was 52.3% while female literacy rate was 47.7%. In the same survey, it ranked as 26th most extensive and the 6th most populous of all the states of Nigeria. A 2015 estimate put the number of residents of Rivers State at over 7 million, nearly triple the number recorded in 1991.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics projection, the population in the state was 4% of the total population of the country. Data of 2010–2015 showed life expectancies for male, 54 years and female, 57 years were very low. General mortality rate was 60 per 1000, under-5 mortality rate was 90 and maternal mortality rate was 889 per 100,000 live births, one of the highest nationwide.\n\nAs a multicultural, multitribal region, Rivers State has much to offer in its diversity of people. The area that makes up the modern state has been inhabited in one way or the other since the last year of the first millennium. The earliest known settled communities in what is now Rivers State include the Ndoki on the lower Imo River and Ikwerre people. Today, over 26 distinct groups are recognized by the Rivers State government, each with its own language, lifestyle, and cultural heritage.\n\nBefore the creation of states in 1967, Igbo was the dominant indigenous language in the Eastern Region out of which much of what now constitutes Rivers State was carved. It was spoken mostly in Port Harcourt, Bonny, Opobo and in several major towns as well as villages. Under the then regional set-up, Opobo, Andoni and Nkoroo formed one division, with Opobo town as headquarters. The language of the native court at\nOpobo which served the three communities was Igbo.\n\nMultilingualism is a part of everyday life for the population of Rivers State and most of Nigeria. English, inherited from colonial rule is common and widely spoken in various forms in different localities. Some indigenous Riverians are also bilingual, speaking a mixture of English or Pidgin English with one of the native languages. This is partly due to the frequent exposure of the younger generations to foreign dialects especially in the country's largest cities. Excluding Pidgin, all other ones spoken in the state belong to either Benue–Congo or Ijoid within the Niger–Congo language family. The Benue–Congo is subdivided into Cross River, Igboid, and Edoid groups. The Ijoid languages are predominant around the creek belt, Cross River is spoken in the central and eastern parts, Igboid dominates mainly the northern and most inland Rivers State while Edoid is used in the western central areas.\n\nLanguages of Rivers State listed by LGA:\n\nRivers State has maintained its importance as a leading supplier of wealth to the nation for centuries. In 2007, the state ranked 2nd nationwide with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $21.07 billion and a per capita income of $3,965.\n\nThe state is famous for its vast reserves of crude oil and natural gas. It was perhaps the richest and most important section of the African zone of the British Empire. Rivers State has two major oil refineries, two major seaports, airports, and various industrial estates spread across the land. More than 60% of the country’s output of crude oil is produced in the state. Other natural resources found within its boundaries are silica sand, glass sand and clay.\n\nPrior to the discovery of oil in commercial quantity in 1951, Agriculture was the primary occupation of the people of Rivers State. Around the 19th century when the industrial revolution reached its peak in England, the area was then referred to as Oil Rivers Protectorate, this was due to its abundant palm oil and kernel which basically constituted the main revenue source of the country. In a sample survey carried out by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, about 40% of the rural inhabitants were committed to farming in 1983. Rivers State is one of the leading states in the production of yam, cassava, cocoyam, maize, rice and beans. About 39% (760,000 hectares) of the state's total land mass, particularly in the upland area, is suitable for cultivation. Major cash crops produced are oil palm products, rubber, coconut, raffia palm and jute. Other crops grown for food include vegetables, melon, pineapples, mango, pepper, banana and plantain. The fishing industry is an important sector in Rivers State. Besides being lucrative, fishing is also a favourite past time activity. There are approximately 270 species of fish existing; with many artisanal fishermen in the riverine areas. The state provides valuable seafood such as crabs, oysters, shrimps and sea snails among others. Vertebrates like birds, mammals and reptiles are also found in the region.\n\nEnergy, and especially electricity is a key factor for economic growth. Rivers State has one of the nation's highest per capita energy consumption rates. As of 2012, it had a power generation capacity of 400 megawatts, a significant improvement over a meagre 30 megawatts during the late nineties. Its energy sector is protected by the government through legislation and funding. It is overseen by the ministries of Power, Energy and Natural Resources. The state's oil-refining capacity is the biggest in the country, with more than 340,000 barrels of crude oil per day.\n\nThere's a vast untapped potential in the state for solar power. Interest in solar energy has been increasing but not much has been invested. Up to now, energy production is insufficient to meet demand, resulting in frequent power outages, slow manufacturing and business performance.\n\nTransportation within Rivers State is mainly land and water-based. The industry has the Ministry of Transport as its chief regulating body. Apart from roads and waterways, there are functional airdromes that provide out-of-state transport. The sea ports contain harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land.\n\nTaxicabs, buses and ferries dominate public transport. They are usually inexpensive and are often used for multi passenger pick ups. Commercial vehicles in Port Harcourt maintain sky blue, white and sky blue livery. Operating without these government-approved colors is punishable with a fine of ₦10,000.\n\nBoth domestic and international flights are available from Port Harcourt International Airport. Airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France, Med-View and Cronos link the state to destinations including Frankfurt, Paris, Lagos and Malabo. Passengers can easily get a taxi or rental car at the authorized vehicle area. Companies like Europcar, Avis and Hertz have offices near the airport. In addition, the Port Harcourt Air Force Base is located in the state capital. It gained popularity as a commercial destination due to the closure of the international airport. After that airport reopened, most airlines abandoned the base. However, it still has some destinations since the airport is closer to the centre than the main airport.\n\nSeaports handle much more diversified import cargo activities than airports. The Port of Onne is one of the largest and busiest seaports in the country. Its mobile harbour cranes are one of the biggest in Africa, with a lifting capacity of 208 metric tonnes. Another important seaport is the Port of Port Harcourt. It was the second largest port in Nigeria in the 1950s. In 1954, it cleared about $54 million worth of imports and exports, while the shipping facilities at Calabar cleared $11 million worth of goods.\n\nMajority of Riverians obtain their water for household uses from vendors. There are also those who extract their water from private boreholes and wells and incur costs for the investment, maintenance, spare parts, pumping, and in some cases treating the water. Several others receive their domestic water from rainwater catchments, nearby streams or rivers. In the oil-bearing communities, many residents have easy access to basic infrastructure systems, although, most of the facilities are nonfunctional.\n\nIn the large urban localities such as Port Harcourt and Obio-Akpor, Port Harcourt Water Corporation handles the provision of urban water supply and wastewater management services for 15% of the population. A number of towns and villages with iron-contaminated HO have resorted to treating one chemical contaminant with another. Most of the water collection in low-income urban residential areas is done by women. In 2008, NDHS reported that 26% of adult females collect drinking water more than adult male counterparts at 21%.\n\nIn order to improve access to safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable water supply services, USAID, through its Sustainable Water and Sanitation in Africa program collaborated with the Ministry of Water Resources and Rural Development from April 2013 to June 2015.\n\nThe Rivers State government consists of elected representatives and appointed officials. The state government has executive and legislative branches, with an independent judiciary. At the local level, elected officials are responsible for local government areas.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by the Governor, assisted by the Deputy Governor, both elected for a term of 4 years (maximum of 2 terms). The governor appoints commissioners responsible for each of the ministries and appoints the heads of parastatals, and the state-owned bodies with specific regulatory or administrative duties. In some cases, a governor may be replaced or removed for example, through death, impeachment or if an election is annulled by a competent court of law or by a two-thirds majority of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative authority in Rivers State is held by the state House of Assembly, which is made up of elected representatives from all constituencies of the state. Its functions at the state level are relative to those of the National Assembly at the federal level, creating laws for the good governance of the state, as well as acting as a check and balance on the powers and actions of the state's Chief Executive. The House of Assembly consists three times the total number of seats which the state has in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe judicial branch of the state government has sole authority and responsibility for the interpretation and application of the state's laws as well as the adjudication of disputes or controversies. It consists of eight courts: the High Court of Justice, the Magistrates Courts, the Customary Courts, the Juveniles Courts, the Revenue Courts, the Sanitation Courts, the Mobile Courts and Ports Related Offences Courts. It is governed mainly by the Chief Judge of the High Court of Justice. There are about 26 serving judges in the High Court of Justice, which comprises 10 Judicial Divisions including Port Harcourt, Ahoada, Degema, Nchia, Bori, Omoku, Isiokpo, Okrika, Okehi, and Oyigbo.\n\nElections are conducted every 4 years in which riverian voters will directly elect 16 representatives to the Nigerian National Assembly. Those chosen are grouped into 3 senators representing Rivers South East, Rivers West, Rivers East and 13 representatives representing Andoni/Opobo/Nkoro, Obio/Akpor, Oyigbo/Tai/Eleme, Port Harcourt II, Etche/Omuma, Asari-Toru/Akuku-Toru, Okrika/Ogu–Bolo, Khana/Gokana, Port Harcourt I, Ahoada West/Ogba–Egbema–Ndoni, Abua–Odual/Ahoada East, Ikwerre/Emohua, Degema/Bonny. Since the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1999, the People's Democratic Party has usually held a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nRivers State is currently consisted of 23 Local Government Areas, all of which handle local administration, under an elected Chairman. Each of the local government areas has its own administrative seat. They are:\n\nIn 1999, the state had 2,805 government primary schools and 243 secondary schools. The secondary schools are concentrated mainly in LGA headquarter towns and in Port Harcourt.\n\nTertiary institutions include the University of Port Harcourt, Choba, Port Harcourt established by the federal government in 1975, the Rivers State University, founded in 1980 by the state government, the School of Health Technology, Port Harcourt, established by the state government, the Federal College of Education (Technical), Omoku and the state-owned Ken Saro Wiwa Polytechnic at Bori, the Ignatius Ajuru University of Education (Ignatius Ajuru University) at Rumuolumeni, Nkpolu Oroworukwo and Ndele and the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Rumueme, Port Harcourt. The Elechi Amadi Polytechnic in Port Harcourt gained polytechnic status in 2006 and was named Port Harcourt Polytechnic and later renamed Elechi Amadi Polytechnic after the scholar Elechi Amadi\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Moscow Conservatory and emigrated to the United States in 1893.\n\nIn 1903 Altschuler organized the Russian Symphony Orchestra Society of New York City, which for two decades toured the United States featuring performances and compositions by leading contemporary Russians. Among the Orchestra's notable premieres were Sergei Prokofiev Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D-flat major, Op. 10, which was performed at Carnegie Hall in New York on December 10, 1918 and Mussorgsky's \"Prelude to Khovanshchina\", which Altschuler presented at Carnegie Hall on February 25, 1905. The Orchestra was among the first established orchestral ensembles to record for the gramophone; Columbia discs of short pieces by Tchaikovsky, Eduard Lassen and others date from about 1910. Nathaniel Shilkret, a member of the Orchestra, notes in his autobiography that soloists in the Orchestra included Mischa Elman, Josef Lhevinne, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Vassily Safanov. Shilkret also noted that the Orchestra \"played for the great ballerina Pavlova and her partner Mordkin [1910].\"\n\nDespite his rigorous classical training, Altschuler was not averse to modernist experimentation.

Later on, she was educated at the University of Tehran in the Faculty of Fine Arts, from which she graduated in 1949. Mansooreh left Iran in the early 1950s to live in Italy, where she furthered her education at the Rome Academy of Fine Arts leading up to her artistic début at the 28th (XXVIII) Venice Biennial in 1956.\n\nAfter a moderately successful period in Italy, Mansooreh returned to Iran in 1959 and won several awards in the Tehran Painting Biennial. In 2004 she exhibited at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nMansooreh is known for having produced works in both figurative and abstract styles. Her works have often included elements of Kufic script. She is known, along with Behjat Sadr, to use traditional elements of both the Persian culture and that of contemporary Europeans. She is considered to be an experimentalist. She is a Permanent Member of Islamic Republic of Iran's Academy of Arts.\n\nMansooreh also wrote many art reviews in various Iranian media. In her critiques she was unbiased, informative, and analytic. For example, in her article \"Why exhibitions have no viewers?\" (reviewing Guity Novin's exhibition \"Expression of Silence\"), published in Kayhan in November, 1971, she observed that Iranian intelligentsia ignored important exhibitions such as the recently held exhibition of Henry Moore in the National Museum of Iran. She wrote:\n\"A friend who was just back from Europe was asking me \"what’s the matter? Is it possible to see the original works by Henry Moore? This is the event of the century. We have to plan in advance for visiting such an exhibition, we have to be checked by electronic cameras, and security gourds that protect such treasures, etc.\" and yet when I asked an icon of the Iranian modern poetry in the theatre of museum that \"have you visited Henry Moore’s sculptures?\" He replied \"those torsos? ..yeh, but I thought they are your works?\"\" \nThen she moved to her critique of Novin’s work:\"\"Expression of Silence, was a poetic designation for Guity’s exhibition in the Negar Galley.\"\" She concluded the article with her verdict:\n\"There was a consistency in her selection of subjects -- a testament to perspicacious and enlightened character of the artist.

{"id": "1967009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967009", "title": "The Denial of Death", "text": "The Denial of Death\n\nThe Denial of Death is a 1973 work of psychology and philosophy by the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in which the author builds on the works of Søren Kierkegaard, Sigmund Freud, Norman O. Brown and Otto Rank. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1974, two months after the author's death.\n\nThe premise of \"The Denial of Death\" is that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic survival mechanism. Becker argues that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the dilemma of mortality through heroism, by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's \"immortality project\" (or \"\"causa sui\" project\"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality. By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal: something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nImmortality projects are one way that people manage death anxiety. Some people, however, will keep themselves drunk or use drugs to escape their anxiety in the face of death. Others will try to manage the terror of death by ignoring the problem and by “tranquilizing oneself with the trivial.” (A term Becker borrows from Kierkegaard.) Becker describes the success of the Christian world picture as being able to take “slaves, cripples... the simple and the mighty” and turn them into heroes of their own story by looking beyond this world to the heavenly realm where they will be rewarded for their heroism by God and live with Him forever.\n\nBecker argues that the arbitrariness of human-invented immortality projects makes them naturally prone to conflict. When one immortality project conflicts with another, it is essentially an accusation of 'wrongness of life', and so sets the context for both aggressive and defensive behavior. Each party will want to prove its belief system is superior, a better way of life. Thus these immortality projects are considered a fundamental driver of human conflict, such as in wars, bigotry, genocide, and racism.\n\nAnother theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional \"hero-systems\", such as religion, are no longer convincing in the age of reason. However, he argued the loss of religion leaves humanity with impoverished resources for necessary illusions. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing \"illusions\" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world.\n\nBecker concludes the introductory section of a chapter where he offers \"A General View of Mental Illness\" with the summary observation that \"mental illness represents styles of bogging-down in the denial of creatureliness\" that is part and parcel of immortality projects.\n\nAt one extreme, people experiencing depression have the sense that their immortality project is failing. They either begin to think the immortality project is false or feel unable to successfully be a hero in terms of that immortality project. As a result, they are consistently reminded of their mortality, biological body, and feelings of worthlessness.\n\nAt the other extreme, Becker describes schizophrenia as a state in which a person becomes so obsessed with his or her personal immortality project as to altogether deny the nature of all other realities. Schizophrenics create their own internal, mental reality in which they define and control all purposes, truths, and meanings. This makes them pure heroes, living in a mental reality that is taken as superior to both physical and cultural realities.\n\nLike the schizophrenic, creative and artistic individuals deny both physical reality and culturally-endorsed immortality projects, expressing a need to create their own reality. The primary difference is that creative individuals have talents that allow them to create and express a reality that others may appreciate, rather than simply constructing an internal, mental reality.\n\n\"The Denial of Death\" has been praised for its post-Freudian approach to psychoanalysis, and has been criticized for its reductive depictions of mental health and humanity.\n\nThe book helped to inspire a revival of interest in the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Rank.\n\nThe book has also had a wide cultural impact beyond the fields of psychology and philosophy. The book made an appearance in Woody Allen's film \"Annie Hall\", when the death-obsessed character Alvy Singer buys it for his girlfriend Annie. It was referred to by Spalding Gray in his work \"It's a Slippery Slope\".

Colloquially it is often known simply as \"Glasshouse\". At the 2016 census, Glass House Mountains had a population of 5,065.\n\nThe town Glass House Mountains is located, approximately north of Brisbane.\n\nThe town also has a train station and a railway line that runs northwards towards Northern Queensland and southwards to Brisbane. The Bruce Highway runs along the locality's eastern border.\n\nMany of the town's original foundations were built on sugarcane, pineapple and farming.\n\nAll Saints' Anglican church was dedicated on 19 February 1939 by Archbishop William Wand. It closed circa 1993.\n\nThe original European farmers that settled in the area brought soccer with them, and it has remained a popular local sport. The soccer grounds were built mostly using resources donated by farmers.\n\nGlass Mountains Provisional School opened on 17 Apr 1906, but closed in 1907 due to low student numbers. It reopened as Glass Mountains State School on 31 October 1910. It was renamed Glass House Mountains State School in 1917, but returned to the name Glass Mountains State School in 1923. In 1935 it was renamed Glasshouse Mountains State School.\n\nThe area was also used as a filming location for the movie \"Sinbad and The Minotaur\", with Mount Coonowrin (Crookneck) (closed 1999), Mount Beerwah (closed 2009), Mount Tibrogargan and Mount Ngungun being shown predominantly throughout the movie.\n\nIn May 2011, the remains of teenager Daniel Morcombe were found at Kings Road in Glass House Mountains. Morcombe had been missing, presumed murdered, since 2003 and his disappearance sparked a massive police investigation including a $1M reward.\n\nGlass House Mountains has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nIn the 2016 Census, there were 5,065 people in Glass House Mountains. 78.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.7% and New Zealand 3.4%. 91.2% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.1%, Catholic 18.5% and Anglican 17.6%.\n\nThe Sunshine Coast Regional Council operates a mobile library service which visits the Community Hall on Coonowrin Road.\n\nGlass House Mountains State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 58 Coonowrin Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 398 students with 26 teachers (23 full-time equivalent) and 20 non-teaching staff (12 full-time equivalent).\n\n"}

It was located in the present-day French départements of the Bas-Rhin and the Vosges and was one of a number of partitions of Salm.\n\nSalm-Salm was created as a partition of Salm-Dhaun in 1574, and was raised from a County to a Principality in 1739 after being inherited and renamed by Count Nicholas Leopold of Salm-Hoogstraten. Salm-Salm was partitioned between itself and Salm-Neuweiler in 1608.\n\nThe last territorial partition occurred in 1751, when Salm-Salm reorganized its borders with the Duchy of Lorraine.\n\nIn 1790, after the French Revolution, the princes of Salm fled the territory and moved to their castle in Anholt, Westphalia. Salm-Salm then was besieged by the revolutionary army, which blocked food supplies from reaching the state. As a consequence, the population was forced to surrender to France. On March 2, 1793, the French National Convention declared Salm-Salm to be a part of the French Republic and attached it to the Départment of the Vosges. This was recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the Peace of Lunéville of 1801.\n\nSome years later, in 1802/1803, together with Salm-Kyrburg, the prince of Salm-Salm was granted new territories formerly belonging to the Bishops of Münster (Westphalia). The new territory was governed in union with Salm-Kyrburg and was known as the Principality of Salm.\n\nIn 1165, the original County of Salm was divided into the counties of Lower Salm, in the Ardennes, and the county of Upper Salm, situated in the Vosges mountains. In 1738, the County of Upper Salm was elevated to Principality of Salm-Salm.\n\nThe capital of Salm-Salm was first Badonviller, and from 1751 on, Senones. The second part of the name of Salm-Salm derives from Salm Castle near Salm (today La Broque).\n\nAt the end of its existence, Salm-Salm had an area of about 200 km² and 10,000 inhabitants. It was separated from the main part of the Holy Roman Empire when most of Alsace was ceded to France in the 17th century. Until 1766, it was bordered by the Duchy of Lorraine to the west and by France to the east. After Lorraine became a part of France on 24 February 1766, Salm-Salm formed an exclave of the Holy Roman Empire surrounded by French territory.\n\nThe economy of Salm-Salm was mainly based on an iron mine near Grandfontaine.\n\nAt Ludwig Otto's death, the male line became extinct, and the county of Salm-Salm passed to descendants of Friedrich I's youngest son, Friedrich I Magnus (1606-1673). Eventually, the title Prince of Salm was assumed by his descendants as well.\n\n\n"}

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nThe Richmond line opened on 1 December 1864 as a rural branch line in response to the area's success as a farming district and its location at the intersection of two stock routes.\n\nIn 1856, a petition for the establishment of a railway from the residents of Windsor and Richmond had been presented to the Government. In 1860 a grant of (Pounds)57,000 was approved for a railway between Blacktown and Windsor. In the following year it was increased to (Pounds)60,000 for a railway between Blacktown and Richmond. Contracts for earthworks, permanent ways and bridges were let from 1862. The line was opened on 29 November 1864 by Governor Sir John Young. A pilot engine was run before all passenger trains for safety. The original stations were Riverstone, Mulgrave, Windsor and Richmond. Upgrade to the track took place in the late nineteenth century.\n\nA major upgrading of most stations on the line occurred in the 1880s, including Richmond. The present brick platform building dates from 1881, prior to the opening of Windsor station, although the two station buildings are almost identical.\n\nOn 8 December 1926, the line was extended to Kurrajong with the line leaving from Platform 1, then going across the corner of Richmond Park and along the side of March Street. This extension closed on 26 July 1952 after a landslide near Kurrajong during heavy rain. Having low levels of traffic its restoration could not be justified. Little evidence of it now remains.\n\nThe early decades of the 20th century brought further improvements and upgrades to the line. These included the establishment of RAAF Base Richmond in 1925, which resulted in a significant increase in the use of the line. A skillion roof signal box was constructed .\n\nIn 1938 congestion at Clarendon railway station caused by a RAAF Air Show resulted in extensive improvements. All station platforms were increased to 450 feet and additional facilities were installed at Richmond.\n\n1940s plans show proposed additions and alterations to the station in the Inter-war functionalist style and stockyards in the precinct. The station additions were not completed. An undated plan shows a goods shed opposite the station, a turntable and a carriage shed and an engine shed. Water tanks and coal loading facilities are also shown (no longer extant), and a gate keepers cottage on the Sydney side of the level crossing near East Richmond Railway Station.\n\nDuring the 1950s a detached cleaners' building was erected at the rear of the platform building.\n\nAn engine shed was demolished in 1983. There no longer appears to be any evidence of the former yard as the area around the station has been developed for purposes such as carparking and a McDonald's.\n\nAs part of the electrification of the line from Riverstone in 1991, the yard was remodeled with the current train storage sidings laid on the northern side of the station and removal of tracks from the southern side. In 1996 all rooms to the station building were internally altered, except the General Waiting Room. Externally, the building is largely unaltered.\n\nAt around 10am on Monday 22 January 2018 8-car Waratah train A42 arriving at Richmond Platform 2 overran the buffers, resulting in at least 16 serious injuries and the 3rd car to be jacked up. This Waratah set was then sent to Cardiff to be repaired, and has re-entered service with the front carriage replaced with a spare.\n\nBusways operate seven routes to and from Richmond station:\n\nRichmond station is served by one NightRide route:\n\nThe Richmond station precinct includes a type 3, second-class station building with a brick-faced platform (1881), the remnants of a brick dock platform and the remains of the Kurrajong line (both 1926), and a cleaning store (1950).\n\nThe brick station building is a type 3 \"Second Class\" station building dating to 1881. It is a symmetrical building on a centre access with wings at both ends of the building. It has a slate hipped roof with a centre transverse gable. The three painted brick chimneys are a striking feature with their decorative stone and arched chimney pots. The windows are generally timber double hung with stone or concrete lintels and sills. Transom lights are located above most of the timber four panel doors, although some have been removed to accommodate services such as air-conditioning. Painted decorative dentilated mouldings are located at the top of the walls under the eaves. The exterior is punctuated with a variety of new services and signs related to the daily operations of the station.\n\nThe Platform 1 side has a corrugated iron sheeted ogee verandah roof supported on timber columns with sandstone bases that extends only partway along the building. The Platform 2 side has a skillion roofed verandah with decorative iron columns and brackets that extend along the entirety of the central section of the building. It is also sheeted in corrugated style metal sheeting. Modern seating, ticket machines, garbage bins and gardens are located at various locations. The female toilets located on the platform have what appear to be restored early marble and timber station signs hung on the exterior walls.\n\nInternally, the building retains its historic character despite the 1990s refurbishment. Internal detailing includes some mini orb ceilings, ceiling roses, blocked up fireplaces with timber surrounds, moulded plaster cornices, timber window and door frames, architraves and skirtings. Many services are surface mounted.\n\nThe station building is in good condition apart from a few minor issues on Platform 2 near the ticket window where a waterpipe appears to have created some ongoing damp issues to the base of the building that have resulted in mortar degradation and flaking paint. It is also evident that repointing works carried out with hard cement mortar resulted in some deterioration on brick substrate.\n\nExternally the building has a high degree of integrity and intactness. Internally, considerable reorganisation has taken place. However, the overall character of the station remains intact. The removal of the associated rail yard components of the site reduces its ability to demonstrate this element of its history.\n\nA flat roofed, detached brick building which has been constructed as a cleaners room stands between the station building and the edge of Platform 1. It was assessed as being in good condition at the time of heritage listing.\n\nRichmond Station has a brick faced island platform with concrete deck and asphalt finish. Modern buffers are located at the end of the rail line. White aluminium palisade fencing has been erected around the station and pedestrian crossing at the end of the line as a safety barrier.\n\nThe dock platform remains as a brick and grassed island in the middle of the northern carpark. It was assessed as being in moderate condition at the time of heritage listing.\n\nThe former Kurrajong line sidings, former sidings, stock yards, turntable and engine shed appear to be visible under the car park which has been topped with asphalt surface. Remnants may survive below the new surface.\n\nThere are a number of mature trees and plantings on the eastern side of the platform that add to the significant setting of the station.\n\n\nThe yard and evidence of the Kurrajong line appears to have been entirely removed except for an additional line behind Platform 1. Some minor changes have been made to some doors, windows and signage of the Station. The skillion roof signal box appears to have been demolished.\n\nRichmond Railway Station is of state significance as an early railway station dating from 1867 that was instrumental in opening up the farming district of the Hawkesbury to provide transport for fresh produce to the Sydney markets. The 1880s station building is a fine example of a Victorian second-class station building and provides evidence of the prosperity and growth of Richmond following the arrival of the railway during the nineteenth century. The station remains as the terminus for the Richmond Branch Line and is significant as a landmark in the historic town and for its continuity of use for over 140 years. The Kurrajong siding is significant as evidence of the former branch line which operated between Richmond and Kurrajong from 1926 - 1952.\n\nRichmond railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nRichmond Station has historical significance as the termination point for the Sydney metropolitan railway system in that direction dating from 1867, with no continuation of train services by other providers. The station was instrumental in opening up the farming district of Hawkesbury to provide transport for fresh produce to Sydney markets. The existing station building is historically significant as an early station building from the 1880s and for its association with the upgrade of the Richmond line in the 1880s. Remnant dock platform and shadow siding to the rear are one of the few remaining pieces of evidence of the Kurrajong line that operated between 1926 and 1952.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nRichmond Railway Station is aesthetically significant as a fine example of the architecture of larger railway station buildings in the late nineteenth century demonstrating key characteristics of a Victorian second-class station building. It retains most of its original external detailing and provides evidence of the prosperity and growth of Richmond following the arrival of the railway.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe station building is rare as one of three larger, significant station buildings built on the Richmond line in the 1880s, the others being at Windsor and Riverstone.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe station is one of three larger, significant station buildings built on the Richmond line in the 1880s, the others being at Windsor and Riverstone. These differ significantly from the smaller, simpler stations built elsewhere on the line. The station building is a fine example of a late nineteenth century station building, representing the peak of achievement in station architecture that is known as second-class station building.\n\n"}

An individual who acts in this capacity is generally called a guardian \"ad litem\" in such legal proceedings; in Scotland, curator \"ad litem\" is the equivalent term. In England and Wales, since the amendment of the Children Act 1989 established the role of children's guardian, the term is now used only in the term \"guardian \"ad litem\" in Private Law proceedings under rule 9.5. The United States legal system, which at its inception was based on the English legal system, continues to use the terms \"guardian \"ad litem\" and \"attorney \"ad litem\". The legal system in the Republic of Ireland also uses the term guardian \"ad litem\".\n\nThe term is also used in property litigation, where a person may be appointed to act on behalf of an estate in court proceedings, when the estate's proper representatives are unable or unwilling to act.\n\nThe term is also sometimes used to refer to a judge who participates in only a particular case or a limited set of cases and does not have the same status as the other judges of the court.

They live in the eastern part of the Niger Delta, Rivers State, Bonny District; part of them in the Defaka ward of Nkoroo town in close relationship with the Nkoroo people, and another part of them on the isolated island of Iwoma Nkoro, near Kono. Present neighbours of the Defaka, apart from the Nkoroo people, are: at Iwoma, the Ogoni people (speakers of Ogoni/Kana/Khana), and to the east, the Obolo. The Defaka have a less cordial relationship with these peoples than with the Nkoroo.\n\nThe Defaka language is thought to be most closely related to the Ijo languages, which is the basis for the Ijoid language family first proposed by Jenewari (1983). Defaka is being rapidly pushed to extinction as speakers are shifting to the language of the Nkoroo people. All Defaka people speak Nkoroo; most use it as their primary language, even when talking with other Defaka speakers. At most 200 speakers of Defaka are left, mostly elderly people; as such, the language may already be moribund (or nearly so).\n\nThe Defaka have always been a people small in number, and their history is a long narrative of harassment by numerically superior neighbours and subsequent migrations. According to oral histories reported in Jenewari (1983), the original home of the Defaka was in the Iselema area (present-day Delta State). From there, they moved via the Central Delta into the Eastern Delta region, where they lived close to the Abuloma people in the Okrika territory. Later they lived close to the Udekama (Degema) people in the Engenni area, and subsequently they entered the Bonny territory to live at Abalama Olotombia, and later near Bodo in Ogoni. They moved to Iyoba in the Andoni country before establishing Olomama Nkoroo (\"Old town\"). From there, they finally moved to the present-day Nkoroo town. The Nkoroo people, neighbours of the Defaka and numbering about 4500, relate a similar tradition of migration. Thus, the Defaka and Nkoroo peoples have presumably been living together as neighbours prior to the establishment of Nkoroo town, perhaps even since the time that both of them were in the Okrika territory.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "1967090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967090", "title": "Al Cowlings", "text": "Al Cowlings\n\nAllen \"A.C.\" Cowlings (born June 16, 1947) is a former American football player and actor. He played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 to 1979 for the Buffalo Bills, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks, and San Francisco 49ers. Cowlings was taken fifth overall in the first round by the Buffalo Bills in the 1970 NFL Draft. \n\nCowlings is most famous for his role in aiding his close friend O. J. Simpson in fleeing from the police on June 17, 1994, after Simpson's ex-wife and her friend were found murdered. After leading police on a low-speed chase, Cowlings drove Simpson back to his home where he was arrested.\n\nCowlings was born on June 16, 1947, in San Francisco, and was raised in its Potrero Hill neighborhood. There, he was a member of the Superiors social club, which held meetings at the Booker T. Washington Community Center. He attended Galileo High School, where he played football with O. J. Simpson. He and Simpson became friends. After high school, the pair attended City College of San Francisco, where they played on the football team.\n\nCowlings was named an All-American defensive tackle after his senior year at the University of Southern California (USC). During his senior year, the 1969 Trojan team went undefeated, and Cowlings led a powerful defensive line, which was nicknamed \"The Wild Bunch\" after the movie of the same name.\n\nCowlings was drafted fifth in the first round of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. He was a starter his first three years in Buffalo, but he was traded to Houston Oilers after the 1972 season. He played all 14 games for the Oilers in both 1973 and 1974, but he played just five games in 1975 for the Rams. In 1976, he became a charter member of the Seattle Seahawks, after being signed off the waiver wire when the Rams released him at the end of the pre-season. He played just one game, due to an injury he suffered while playing for the Rams in an exhibition game against the Seahawks. He returned to the Rams in 1977, Played with CFL Montreal Alouettes 1978, and finished his career in 1979 with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nCowlings' first film role was in the 1985 film \"Bubba Until It Hurts\", starring Bubba Smith. He had a recurring minor role as Coach Nabors in the HBO football sitcom \"1st & Ten\", which also starred Simpson. Cowlings also served as a technical football advisor on the football scenes in the 1991 Tony Scott film, \"The Last Boy Scout\".\n\nCowlings was a close friend of O. J. Simpson, whom he has known since childhood. They were teammates at Galileo High School, San Francisco City College, USC, the Buffalo Bills, and the San Francisco 49ers. Cowlings dated Simpson's first wife Marguerite Whitley while they were attending Galileo High School and when they were having issues as a couple, Simpson stepped in as a mediator, but the discussion turned into a relationship and they would eventually marry in 1967; Cowlings was reportedly angry at the time, but their friendship prevailed. They remained close friends and confidants through the years, with Cowlings being the godfather of Simpson's son Jason and a groomsman at Simpson and Brown's wedding in February 1985. Cowlings was also the ring bearer at mutual friends Robert and Kris Kardashian's wedding in July 1978. \nFollowing the murders of Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman on June 12, 1994, in which Simpson was a person of interest, Brown's funeral took place in the St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Brentwood on June 16, Cowlings' 47th birthday; Cowlings served as a gatekeeper and pallbearer at the funeral.\n\nThe next day, despite agreeing to turn himself into the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Simpson failed to surrender at the Parker Center station. Later that day, witnesses reported seeing Simpson riding in a white Ford Bronco, a vehicle owned and being driven by Cowlings, thus becoming the object of a low-speed chase by police cruisers on the freeways. During the chase, Cowlings made a 911 call from a cell phone and claimed that Simpson was armed with a gun pointed to his own head, demanding that Cowlings drive him to Simpson's estate in Brentwood, or Simpson would kill himself. The slow-speed chase was televised on live TV from helicopter. It interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals, and was viewed by approximately 95 million people in the United States alone. During the chase, Cowlings famously told the police: \"My name is A.C., you know who I am, God damn it!\" The chase ended at Simpson's Brentwood home, where Simpson eventually surrendered to police after a nearly hour-long wait.\n\nWhen the chase concluded and Cowlings and Simpson finally surrendered, Cowlings was arrested and charged with a felony for aiding a fugitive. He was taken to the Los Angeles men's jail, and was released approximately 12 hours after his arrest on $250,000 bail. District Attorney Gil Garcetti eventually determined, however, that Cowlings would not be charged due to a lack of sufficient evidence.\n\nDuring Simpson's criminal trial, Cowlings surprised the media with a press conference held a block from the courthouse. Cowlings retained Beverly Hills public relations firm, Edward Lozzi & Associates, to conduct the press conference, without revealing the reason or itinerary. Lozzi introduced Cowlings and Cowlings's attorney, Donald Re. Cowlings then announced he had created a 900 phone number for the public to ask him questions—about anything \"except\" the murder and trial. Cowlings read a one-minute prepared statement announcing the 900 number, which was simultaneously unveiled visually in the room. Reports that Cowlings realized over a million dollars from this $2-dollars-plus-a-minute 900 number could never be verified. Under oath in his deposition for Simpson's civil trial, Cowlings stated that the 900 number endeavor just \"broke even.\" This press conference was the only time Cowlings officially spoke to the media about anything related to the Simpson case. Former porn star and ex-girlfriend Jennifer Peace, who testified before a grand jury, claimed that Cowlings had confessed to her that a hysterical Simpson had called him on the night of the murders and that the murder weapon had been disposed of; Cowlings denied the allegations. \n\nFollowing the acquittal of Simpson in October 1995, the families of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman filed a civil suit against Simpson for wrongful death. Cowlings was subpoenaed and during both the deposition and trial took the Fifth Amendment when asked what he was doing between June 13, 1994, when Simpson returned from Chicago, and the freeway chase on June 17, 1994, as he could still be charged for aiding and abetting. However, he testified that he had seen Simpson throw out Brown's clothes from their apartment during an argument in 1979 and that while he was driving Brown to a hospital on New Year's Eve 1989, she told him Simpson hit her, which (along with Brown's recorded 911 calls, pictures of her with bruises, and similar witness testimonies that concern physical aggression on Simpson's part against Brown) contradicted Simpson's civil trial testimony that he had never been abusive during their marriage. Simpson was found liable for both deaths in February 1997.\n\nIn 1995, Cowlings' 1993 Ford Bronco from the low-speed chase was purchased by Simpson's former sports agent Mike Gilbert and two other men, then ended up sitting in a parking garage for the next 17 years (1995-2012), where it was rarely used. As of 2017, the vehicle was on loan to the Alcatraz East Crime Museum where it was put on display as part of an exhibit on the O. J. Simpson murder trial.\n\nCowlings is a member of the 2009 USC Athletic Hall of Fame class along with Junior Seau, Rodney Peete, and John Robinson. USC's Cowlings Residential College is named in his honor.\n\nIn 2012, Fox News examined the lives of key individuals in the Simpson case and found that Cowlings was reportedly working as a handbag sales representative. In 2014, an ex-teammate told \"USA Today\" that Cowlings worked for B. Wayne Hughes, founder of Public Storage. Six months later, \"USA Today\" quoted retired tennis player and friend of Cowlings, Joe Kolkowitz, saying that Cowlings had retired and is still living in Southern California. \n\nAccording to TMZ in 2016, Cowlings had reportedly threatened to sue FX if he was portrayed negatively in the critically acclaimed series \"\", in which he is portrayed by Malcolm-Jamal Warner.\n\nIn March 2018, O.J. Simpson (after his parole for armed robbery and kidnapping) stated that he may have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease common in athletes that have suffered numerous head wounds or concussions. Simpson said that close friends and former teammates, including Cowlings, also struggle with the symptoms of CTE.\n\n\n"}

The genus contains only one species, viz. Sherardia arvensis or (blue) field madder, which is widespread across most of Europe and northern Africa as well as southwest and central Asia (from Turkey to Saudi Arabia to Kazakhstan) and Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Azores, Madeira, Savage Islands). It is also reportedly naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Kerguelen, Ethiopia, Sudan, southern Africa, Mexico, Costa Rica, South America, Bermuda, Cuba, Haiti and much of Canada and the United States (especially the Pacific States and the lower Mississippi Valley).\n\n\"Sherardia arvensis\" is an annual plant with trailing and upright stems growing up to 40 cm long, having a square cross-section. The rough pointed bristly leaves of about 1 cm in length are in whorls of four to six (normally six at the ends of the shoots, but four nearer the root).\n\nThe tiny pale lilac or pink flowers are approximately 3 mm in diameter and have a long tube, with only the end part of the four petals free. The flowers grow in clusters of two or three together in an involucral structure formed out of a ring of six bracts.\n\nThe fruit are dry and about 3 mm long with two lobes giving rise to the two seeds (nutlets).\n\nThe four-angled stems with whorls of bristly leaves and tiny flowers are reminiscent of the Bedstraws and other related Rubiaceae, but \"Sherardia\" is distinguished by its mauve/pink flowers that are organized in clusters and having a long corolla tube.\n\n\"Sherardia arvensis\" plants are hermaphroditic and pollinated by flies.\n\n\"Sherardia arvensis\" is a common weed of fields, pasture, grassland, and disturbed areas. The fleshy roots, though much inferior to the common madder (\"Rubia tinctorum\"), are sometimes used for the production of a red dye.\n\nThe genus and species were described by Carl Linnaeus in Hortus Cliffortianus in 1736 and also appeared in his masterwork Species Plantarum in 1753. The genus was named in memory of the prominent English botanist William Sherard (1659–1728). The Latin epithet \"arvensis\" means that it is found in fields.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Whitney family.\n\nWhitney was born on August 17, 1904, in Ellsworth, Maine, Whitney was a descendant of John Whitney, a Puritan who settled in Massachusetts in 1635, as well as of William Bradford, who came over on the \"Mayflower\". His father was Payne Whitney, and his grandfathers were William C. Whitney and John Hay, both presidential cabinet members. His mother was Helen Hay Whitney. \n\nThe Whitneys' family mansion, Payne Whitney House on New York's Fifth Avenue, was around the corner from James B. Duke House, home of the founder of the American Tobacco Co. Whitney's uncle, Oliver Hazard Payne, a business partner of John D. Rockefeller, arranged the funding for Duke to buy out his competitors.\n\nJock Whitney attended Groton School, then Yale College. He joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), as his father had. Whitney, his father, grandfather, and great-uncle were oarsmen at Yale, and his father was captain of the crew in 1898. He was a member of Scroll and Key. While at Yale, he inspired the coining of the term \"crew cut\" for the haircut favored by the rowing crew which still bears the name. After graduating in 1926, Whitney went to Oxford University, but the death of his father necessitated his returning home. He inherited a trust fund of $20 million (approximately $210 million in 2005 dollars), and later inherited four times that amount from his mother.\n\nIn 1929, Whitney, despite his vast wealth, was a clerk at the firm of Lee, Higginson & Co where, through his boss, J.T. Claiborne, Jr., he met former Lee, Higginson clerk Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr., who had come to Claiborne for help in his efforts to gain control of Freeport Texas Co. Williams was a scion of a founding investment firm in the sulfur mining company. In 1929, the year after Whitney became one of the wealthiest men in America, through inheritance, Williams enlisted the help of Whitney's boss, who then enlisted Whitney's financial participation, in his efforts to oust founder and Chairman Eric P. Swenson, casting Whitney in the role of corporate raider before the term existed. Whitney was soon Freeport's biggest shareholder, enabling Williams to replace the chairman and his management team. Claiborne was made a Vice-President; Williams became Freeport's president in 1933, and Whitney was appointed Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn 1946, Whitney founded J.H. Whitney & Company, the oldest venture capital firm in the U.S., with Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.—who coined the term \"venture capital\"—with J. T. Claiborne as a partner. Whitney put up $10 million to finance entrepreneurs with business plans who were unwelcome at banks. Companies Whitney invested in included Spencer Chemical and Minute Maid. In 1958, while he was still ambassador to the United Kingdom, his company Whitney Communications Corp. bought the \"New York Herald Tribune\", and was its publisher from 1961 to its closure in 1966. Whitney Communications also owned and operated other newspapers, magazines and broadcasting stations. Whitney's television stations were sold to Dun & Bradstreet in 1969.\n\nWhitney invested in several Broadway shows, including Peter Arno's 1931 revue \"Here Goes the Bride\", a failure that cost him $100,000, but was more successful as one of the backers of \"Life with Father\".\n\nAn October 1934 \"Fortune\" article on the Technicolor Corporation noted Whitney's interest in pictures. He had met Technicolor head Herbert Kalmus at the Saratoga Race Course. In 1932, Technicolor achieved a breakthrough with its three-strip process. Merian C. Cooper of RKO Radio Pictures approached Whitney with the idea of investing in Technicolor. They joined forces and founded Pioneer Pictures in 1933, with a distribution deal with RKO to distribute Pioneer's films. Whitney and his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney bought a 15% stake in Technicolor.\n\nWhitney was also the major investor in David O. Selznick's production company Selznick International Pictures, putting up $870,000 and serving as Chairman of the Board. He put up half the money to option Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" for the Selznick film version, in which he then invested, and later in \"Rebecca\" (1940).\n\nWhitney served in the United States Army Air Forces as an intelligence officer during World War II, assigned to the Office of Strategic Services. He was taken prisoner by the Germans in southern France, but escaped when the train transporting him to a POW camp came under Allied fire.\n\nWhitney inherited his family's love of horses, a predilection he shared with his sister, Joan Whitney Payson. Jock and his sister ran Greentree Stables in the U.S., owned by their mother. In 1928, he became the youngest member ever elected to The Jockey Club.\n\nWhitney and his first wife \"Liz\" raced horses both in the United States and in Europe. He owned Easter Hero who won the 1929 and 1930 editions of the Cheltenham Gold Cup. In the 1929 Grand National, his horse twisted a plate and was beaten by a nose at the finish. Although Whitney entered the Grand National annually, he never again came close to winning.\n\nThe Whitneys entered four horses in the Kentucky Derby in the 1930s, \"Stepenfetchit,\" which finished 3rd in 1932, \"Overtime,\" which finished 5th in 1933, \"Singing Wood,\" which finished 8th in 1934, and \"Heather Broom,\" which finished 3rd in 1939.\n\nJock Whitney was also an outstanding polo player, with a four-goal handicap, and it was as a sportsman that he made the cover of the March 27, 1933, issue of \"Time\" magazine.\n\nIn 2015, Whitney was posthumously inducted to the National Museum of Racing's Hall of Fame as Pillar of the Turf.\n\nWhitney was the major backer of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower appointed him United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, a post held sixty years earlier by Whitney's grandfather John Hay. Whitney played a major role in improving Anglo-American relations, which had been severely strained during the 1956 Suez Crisis, when Eisenhower demanded that the British, French and Israelis terminate their invasion of Egypt.\n\nIn 1930, Whitney purchased the Llangollen estate as a bridal gift for his fiancée, the Pennsylvania socialite Mary Elizabeth \"Liz\" Altemus. It was a historic equestrian farm just outside Middleburg, Virginia. They were married on September 23, 1931. Although married to Altemus, Whitney was romantically linked to Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Bennett, Paulette Goddard and Joan Crawford. Clark Gable and Carole Lombard met at one of Whitney's parties. In the early 1930s, Jock Whitney began an affair with Nina Gore Vidal; at the same time Mary Altemus Whitney had an affair with Nina Vidal's husband Eugene Vidal. The couple divorced in 1940, but Liz Whitney remained at Llangollen for the rest of her life, becoming an internationally renowned horse breeder and a member of the Virginia Thoroughbred Association Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1942, he married Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, ex-wife of James Roosevelt, son of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and adopted her two daughters:\n\nWhitney met Fred Astaire in New York City while the former was a student at Yale University and they became lifelong friends, sharing a passion for horse racing. Whitney became a major investor in two of Astaire's Broadway stage vehicles, \"The Band Wagon\" (1930) and \"Gay Divorce\" (1932), and played a crucial role in securing for Astaire a contract with RKO Pictures in 1933, using his contacts with Merion C. Cooper - both men were board members of Pan American Airways whose planes were prominently featured in Astaire's breakthrough film with Ginger Rogers: \"Flying Down to Rio\" (1933).\n\nDuring the 1970s, Whitney was listed as one of the ten wealthiest men in the world. The residences at his disposal over the years included an estate on Long Island; Greenwood Plantation in Georgia; a townhouse and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island, near New London, Connecticut; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Georgia, where he was a member of the Augusta National Golf Club; and a spacious house Cherry Hill in Virginia Water, Surrey, England, near the Ascot Racecourse. Mr. Whitney also owned an estate in Aiken, South Carolina, which he considered his 'retirement' home and where he hoped to spend his final days.\n\nWhitney died on February 8, 1982 at North Shore Hospital, Manhasset, Long Island, after a long illness\n\nPayne Whitney made substantial gifts to Yale, to the New York Presbyterian Hospital, and the New York Public Library. After his father's death, the family built the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale in his honor. The family also financed Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at New York Presbyterian Hospital in 1932.\n\nWhitney created the John Hay Whitney Foundation for educational projects in 1946. The Foundation provided fellowships to the racially and culturally deprived. He became a major contributor to Yale University, where he served as a Fellow of the Corporation.\n\nIn 1951, he and his wife Betsey Cushing Whitney donated land from their \"Greentree\" estate in Manhasset, New York toward the building of North Shore Hospital. Currently called North Shore University Hospital, it is the flagship hospital of the 3rd largest not-for-profit secular healthcare system in the United States, the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.\n\nIn 1953, Whitney received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s/early 1970's John Hay Whitney donated two small parcels of land in Manhasset to the County of Nassau and to the Manhasset-Lakeville Volunteer Fire Department. The Nassau County parcel was the new home for the 6th Police Precinct of the Nassau County Police, located at the S/E intersection of Community Drive and East Community Drive. Just east of the 6th pct, at 2 E Community Dr., the M-LFD parcel was the new home of Fire Company #2 of the M-LFD, where John Hay Whitney was voted in by the membership of Company number two as an Honorary Member of the Company.\n\nIn 1930 Whitney was elected to the board of trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and named President of the MoMA Film Library in 1935. In 1941 he succeeded Nelson A. Rockefeller as President of MoMA. In 1946 he succeeded Stephen C. Clark as Chairman of the Board of Trustees\n\nWhen Whitney moved to England as United States Ambassador, he took a number of his favourite artworks with him to enjoy during his posting. Before his return to the US, he agreed for the first time to loan part of his collection for the public to see. He provided the Tate Gallery with 56 paintings from the collection in England and specially brought in a further 11 paintings from the US. The exhibition, the John Hay Whitney Collection, ran from 16 December 1960 to 29 January 1961 \n\nIn 1983 the National Gallery of Art, Washington held an exhibition of the John Hay Whitney Collection with paintings loaned by Whitney's wife, The Museum of Modern Art and Yale University Art Gallery \n\nAmong the paintings in his collection, Jock Whitney's prized possession was the \"Bal au moulin de la Galette\" painted in 1876 by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. In 1990, his widow put the painting up for auction with Sotheby's, New York and it sold for US$78 million to Japanese businessman, Ryoei Saito.\n\nWhitney's widow donated a number of paintings from his collection to the Greentree Foundation. One of those paintings by Pablo Picasso, Garçon à la pipe was auctioned by Sotheby's in May 2004 for $104 million \n\nThe following works have been publicly exhibited or sold from the former collection of John Hay Whitney.\n\n\nSources: \nJohn Hay Whitney Collection (Catalogue), Tate Gallery, 1960, John Hay Whitney Collection (Catalogue), National Gallery of Art, 1983, Sotheby's Catalogue, auction 10 May 1999, Sotheby's Catalogue, auction 5 May 2004\n\nWhitney gave Fred Astaire a pair of big-wheel roller skates as a present. A few years later roller skating was one of his most important dance numbers on film.\n\nWhitney and Jimmy Altemus provided the lyrics for a sing composed by Fred Astaire, \"Tappin' the Time.\"\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower took pains to transmit to Ambassador Whitney in London, by telegram, the first round golf scores of the Masters Tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club on 5 April 1957.\nAmbassador Whitney had a very demanding and exhausting scheduled but was not fazed by it. After having been to three or four receptions one day, his wife was not surprised to find their chauffeur, groggy from his rounds, dozing on the back seat of their limousine and the Ambassador driving the car.\n\nWhitney: \"I have just had a heart attack and am on a very strict diet. However if you will twist my arm a little, I will probably give in and we will consume a number of very large dry martinis\" \n\nWilliam S. Paley (the legendary founder of CBS), who was Whitney's brother in law, had a gentle rivalry with Whitney.

Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, 1 October 1964)\n\nBefore the start of his brief papacy, John Paul I said that Escrivá's teachings are \"radical; he goes as far as talking about \"materializing\" --in a good sense-- the quest for holiness. For him, it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity.\" \n\nJohn Paul II stated “[Opus Dei] has as its aim the sanctification of one’s life, while remaining within the world at one’s place of work and profession: to live the Gospel in the world, while living immersed in the world, but in order to transform it, and to redeem it with one’s personal love for Christ. This is truly a great ideal, which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state, which is a characteristic mark of the Church of the Council and after the Council.” L’Osservatore Romano, August 27, 1979. He established Opus Dei as a Personal Prelature in 1982 and the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in 1990, and canonized its founder in 2002. He also said upon creating Opus Dei as a personal prelature, “With very great hope, the Church directs its attention and maternal care to Opus Dei, which -- by divine inspiration --the Servant of God Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer founded in Madrid on October 2, 1928, so that it may always be an apt and effective instrument of the salvific mission which the Church carries out for the life of the world. From its beginnings, this Institution has in fact striven, not only to illuminate with new lights the mission of the laity in the Church and in society, but also to put it into practice.” Ut Sit, November 1982 (the apostolic constitution by which Opus Dei was made a personal prelature of the Catholic Church in accord with Code of Canon Law sections 294-97).\n\nIn an Address to Theological Study Convention on the Teaching of Blessed Josemaria Escriva, October 14, 1993, John Paul II stated: \"In the 65 years since its foundation, the Prelature of Opus Dei, an indissoluble unity of priests and lay people, has contributed to making Christ's saving message resound in many walks of life. As Pastor of the universal Church, echoes of this apostolate reach me. I encourage all the members of the Prelature of Opus Dei to persevere in this work, in faithful continuity with the spirit of service to the Church which always inspired the life of your founder.\" \n\nBenedict XVI, three years before becoming Pope, said \"the theocentrism of Escrivá...means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal...This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'big bang' God retired from history.\"\n\nJohn Paul II said Opus Dei \"anticipated the theology of the lay state, which is a characteristic mark of the Church of the Council and after the Council.\" The Catholic Church's Second Vatican Council states: \n\nWith Escriva's teaching that God comes close to us and we can cooperate with his plan of salvation, John Paul II said that \"it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34).\" \n\nThe biblical concept that everyone is called to sanctity was already enunciated by Augustine of Hippo, Francis of Sales, and Alphonsus Liguori, but their emphasis was on prayer and liturgical devotions, basically monastic spirituality applied to lay people. \"Escrivá is more radical,\" writes Cardinal Luciani (1977), who later became John Paul I. \"For him, it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity,\" thus providing a lay spirituality for lay people to attain holiness. Thus, Sebastiano Baggio, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, states that Escrivá is a \"turning point in the history of Christian spirituality. \"The \"absolute novelty\" of Opus Dei, says Cardinal Franz König (1975), the perceived leader of the \"progressivists\" in Vatican II, lies in teaching that the two separated worlds of religious life and professional life \"should in fact walk together.\" On a deeper level, the \"great originality\" of Opus Dei's message, states José Saraiva Martins (2002), is based on the teaching that all of creation has been sanctified by the God-become-flesh: movies, boardrooms, gardens, sports can and should lead to God. In this Christian materialism, as Escrivá calls it, Christians leading an integral life of prayer and mortification are called to \"passionately love the world\" and to overcome the \"enemies of sanctity\": greed, lust and egoism. \nIn the work of spreading a message that to many seems new, Opus Dei faced challenges, misunderstandings and controversies, leading some Catholic leaders like Cardinal John Carmel Heenan to see Opus Dei as a sign of contradiction, a \"sign that is spoken against\" (Lk 2:34). \n\nIn the 1940s, some Jesuits led by Fr. Angel Carrillo de Albornoz, who later left the Society of Jesus, denounced Opus Dei's teachings as \"a new heresy.\" It is not orthodox, they said, to teach that the laity can be holy without public vows and distinctive clothing. Also, these critics were concerned that Opus Dei would take away vocations from the religious orders. \n\nBased on reports from Spain, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Fr. Wlodimir Ledochowski (1866–1942), told the Vatican he considered Opus Dei \"very dangerous for the Church in Spain.\" He described it as having a \"secretive character\" and saw \"signs in it of a covert inclination to dominate the world with a form of Christian Masonry.\" This attack against Opus Dei from within well-regarded ecclesiastical circles (\"the opposition by good people,\" Escrivá called it), which happened time and again in its history, is considered the root of present-day accusations coming from the most varied quarters. This is the conclusion of a number of writers, including John L. Allen, Jr., a Catholic American journalist, in his work \"Opus Dei: an Objective Look Behind the Myths and Reality of the Most Controversial Force in the Catholic Church\" (2005). \nSome time after the end of the Second Vatican Council, Opus Dei critics started stating that it has an ultraconservative and reactionary vision of the Roman Catholic faith. In contrast, Messori and Allen state that the Opus Dei prelature does not have any doctrine other than what the Catholic Church teaches. Catholic thinkers such as George Weigel say the use of \"conservative\", a political category, on religious, moral, or intellectual matters is \"implausible and distorting.\" These should be categorised, they say, as either faithful or heretical, good or evil, true or false. The \"handing on\" (\"traditio\") of \"living faith,\" writes Weigel, has the \"capacity to inspire innovative thinking.\" Opus Dei is the perfect storm, says Allen: It has become the center of the debate in the post-Vatican II polarization in Catholic politics.\n\nThe late Hans Urs von Balthasar, considered one of the greatest theologians of the 20th century, discussed Opus Dei in an article entitled \"Fundamentalism,\" describing it as \"a concentration of fundamentalist power in the Church.\" (article in \"Wort und Wahrheit\", 1963). He based his negative views on his reading of some points of Escriva's main book, The Way, which von Balthasar did not consider of sufficient spiritual depth for its worldwide goals. On the other hand, V. Messori, who studied the von Balthasar issue, says that the theologian later retracted his views after more in-depth study and after meeting members of Opus Dei. He even defended Opus Dei against attacks.\n\n"}

He is principally known as an author of religious and historical writings. \n\nRamus was born at Aukra in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. His parents were parish priest Danil Johnsen Ramus (d. 1654) and Anna Christensdatter Bernhoft (1624–1705). Ramus belonged a family of clerics, with the father, grandfather, stepfather and two brothers, clerics and scholars in various positions. He lost his father early, but her stepfather, Hans Olsen Brejer, took responsibility for his basic education. After studies at the Trondheim Cathedral School, in 1665 he was discharged to the University of Copenhagen with two of his brothers. For the next 15 years, he is believed to have continued studying in Copenhagen.\n\nIn the 1680s Ramus became personnel chaplain in Sørum Church (\"Sørum kirke\") in Romerike under the priest Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg. From 1690 Ramus was senior priest of Norderhov Church (\"Norderhov kirke\") at Ringerike in Buskerud. Ramus became a magistrate in 1698.\n\nIn 1680, he published his first book, \"Naadens aandelige Markets-Tiid\". It quickly became popular and was issued in both Swedish and Danish editions. Ramus also wrote about the famous Maelstrom at Moskenstraumen. His work was read by Edgar Allan Poe and featured in his short story \"A Descent into the Maelström\" (1841).\n\nPerhaps his best known book was \"Norges Beskrivelse\" which contains a poem about a feral child, \"Jostedalsrypa\". She was the only survivor of the Black Death in the remote valley of Jostedal after of the Black Death (\"Svartedauden\").\n\nIn 1682, he married Anna Colbjørnsdatter (ca. 1667- 1736), the daughter of pastor Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg (1628–1720) in Sørum. They had five children: Ole (1683-1714), Daniel (1684-1727), Johanna (1685-1717), Christian (1686-1714) and Anna Sophie (1687-1722), all of whom were born in Sørum. Their son, Daniel Ramus followed his father as a priest in Norderhov from 1717, when his father was sick. Ramus died in 1718 at Norderhov. \n\nAnna Colbjørnsdatter became known for her role in the skirmish at Norderhov (\"Slaget på Norderhov\") between Norwegian-Danish and Swedish forces on 29 March 1716. She and her family were residing in the Norderhov Rectory in Ringerike. Reportedly she alerted the Norwegians to the presence of the troops of King Charles XII of Sweden in the church yard at Norderhov, where they had taken shelter in and around the rectory. The event itself was first published by Peter Andreas Munch in his book, \"Norges, Sveriges og Danmarks Historie til Skolebrug\" (1838).\n\nHer half-brothers, Hans Colbjørnsen (1675-1754) and Peder Colbjørnsen (1683–1738), were successful timber merchants in Fredrikshald.

{"id": "1967137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967137", "title": "QCD vacuum", "text": "QCD vacuum\n\nThe QCD vacuum is the vacuum state of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is an example of a \"non-perturbative\" vacuum state, characterized by non-vanishing condensates such as the gluon condensate and the quark condensate in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of quark matter.\n\nLike any relativistic quantum field theory, QCD enjoys Poincaré symmetry including the discrete symmetries CPT (each of which is realized). Apart from these space-time symmetries, it also has internal symmetries. Since QCD is an SU(3) gauge theory, it has local SU(3) gauge symmetry.\n\nSince it has many flavours of quarks, it has approximate flavour and chiral symmetry. This approximation is said to involve the chiral limit of QCD. Of these chiral symmetries, the baryon number symmetry is exact. Some of the broken symmetries include the axial U(1) symmetry of the flavour group. This is broken by the chiral anomaly. The presence of instantons implied by this anomaly also breaks CP symmetry.\n\nIn summary, the QCD Lagrangian has the following symmetries:\n\nThe following classical symmetries are broken in the QCD Lagrangian:\n\nWhen the Hamiltonian of a system (or the Lagrangian) has a certain symmetry, but the vacuum does not, then one says that spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) has taken place.\n\nA familiar example of SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, each of which acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a \"preferred direction\", since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.\n\nWhen a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless bosons appear, corresponding to the remaining symmetry. This is called the Goldstone phenomenon and the bosons are called Goldstone bosons.\n\nThe SU() × SU() chiral flavour symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is broken in the vacuum state of the theory. The symmetry of the vacuum state is the diagonal SU() part of the chiral group. The diagnostic for this is the formation of a non-vanishing chiral condensate , where is the quark field operator, and the flavour index is summed. The Goldstone bosons of the symmetry breaking are the pseudoscalar mesons.\n\nWhen , i.e., only the up and down quarks are treated as massless, the three pions are the Goldstone bosons. When the strange quark is also treated as massless, i.e., , all eight pseudoscalar mesons of the quark model become Goldstone bosons. The actual masses of these mesons are obtained in chiral perturbation theory through an expansion in the (small) actual masses of the quarks.\n\nIn other phases of quark matter the full chiral flavour symmetry may be recovered, or broken in completely different ways.\n\nThe evidence for QCD condensates comes from two eras, the pre-QCD era 1950–1973 and the post-QCD era, after 1974. The pre-QCD results established that the strong interactions vacuum contains a quark chiral condensate, while the post-QCD results established that the vacuum also contains a gluon condensate.\n\nIn the 1950s, there were many attempts to produce a field theory to describe the interactions of pions and nucleons. The obvious renormalizable interaction between the two objects is the Yukawa coupling to a pseudoscalar:\n\nAnd this is clearly theoretically correct, since it is leading order and it takes all the symmetries into account. But, in isolation, it doesn't match experiment. \n\nThe interaction that does couples the nucleons to the \"gradient\" of the pion field.\n\nThis is the gradient-coupling model. This interaction has a very different dependence on the energy of the pion—it vanishes at zero momentum.\nThis type of coupling means that a coherent state of low momentum pions barely interacts at all. This is a manifestation of an approximate symmetry, a shift symmetry of the pion field. The replacement\nleaves the gradient coupling alone, but not the pseudoscalar coupling. The σ-model (discussed below), however, arranges that this is also a symmetry of the above Yukawa coupling, in conjunction with the σ-field.\n\nThe modern explanation for the shift symmetry is now understood to be the Nambu-Goldstone non-linear symmetry realization mode, due to Yoichiro Nambu and Jeffrey Goldstone.\nThe pion field is a Goldstone boson, while the shift symmetry is a manifestation of a degenerate vacuum.\n\nThere is a mysterious relationship between the strong interaction coupling of the pions to the nucleons, the coefficient in the gradient coupling model, and the axial vector current coefficient of the nucleon which determines the weak decay rate of the neutron. The relation is\n\nand it is obeyed to 10% accuracy.\n\nThe constant is the coefficient that determines the neutron decay rate. It gives the normalization of the weak interaction matrix elements for the nucleon. On the other hand, the pion-nucleon coupling is a phenomenological constant describing the scattering of bound states of quarks and gluons.\n\nThe weak interactions are current-current interactions ultimately because they come from a non-Abelian gauge theory. The Goldberger–Treiman relation suggests that the pions for some reason interact as if they are related to the same symmetry current.\n\nThe structure which gives rise to the Goldberger–Treiman relation was called the \"partially conserved axial current\" (PCAC) hypothesis, spelled out in the pioneering σ-model paper. Partially conserved describes the modification of a spontaneously-broken symmetry current by an explicit breaking correction preventing its conservation. The axial current in question is also often called the chiral symmetry current.\n\nThe basic idea of SSB is that the symmetry current which performs axial rotations on the fundamental fields does not preserve the vacuum: This means that the current applied to the vacuum produces particles. The particles must be spinless, otherwise the vacuum wouldn't be Lorentz invariant. By index matching, the matrix element must be \nwhere is the momentum carried by the created pion. \n\nWhen the divergence of the axial current operator is zero, we must have\nHence these pions are massless, , in accordance with Goldstone's theorem.\n\nIf the scattering matrix element is considered, we have\nUp to a momentum factor, which is the gradient in the coupling, it takes the same form as the axial current turning a neutron into a proton in the current-current form of the weak interaction.\n\nBut if a small explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry (due to quark masses) is introduced, as in real life, the above divergence does not vanish, and the right hand side involves the mass of the pion, now a Pseudo-Goldstone boson.\n\nExtensions of the PCAC ideas allowed Steven Weinberg to calculate the amplitudes for collisions which emit low energy pions from the amplitude for the same process with no pions. The amplitudes are those given by acting with symmetry currents on the external particles of the collision.\n\nThese successes established the basic properties of the strong interaction vacuum well before QCD.\n\nExperimentally it is seen that the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing evidence for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory.\n\nThis pattern of SSB solves one of the earlier \"mysteries\" of the quark model, where all the pseudoscalar mesons should have been of nearly the same mass. Since , there should have been nine of these. However, one (the SU(3) singlet η′ meson) has quite a larger mass than the SU(3) octet. In the quark model, this has no natural explanation – a mystery named the η−η′ mass splitting (the η is one member of the octet, which should have been degenerate in mass with the η′).\n\nIn QCD, one realizes that the η′ is associated with the axial U(1) which is \"explicitly broken\" through the chiral anomaly, and thus its mass is not \"protected\" to be small, like that of the η. The η–η′ mass splitting can be explained\n\nPCAC and current algebra also provide evidence for this pattern of SSB. Direct estimates of the chiral condensate also come from such analysis.\n\nAnother method of analysis of correlation functions in QCD is through an operator product expansion (OPE). This writes the vacuum expectation value of a non-local operator as a sum over VEVs of local operators, i.e., condensates. The value of the correlation function then dictates the values of the condensates. Analysis of many separate correlation functions gives consistent results for several condensates, including the gluon condensate, the quark condensate, and many mixed and higher order condensates. In particular one obtains\n\nHere refers to the gluon field tensor, to the quark field, and to the QCD coupling.\n\nThese analyses are being refined further through improved sum rule estimates and direct estimates in lattice QCD. They provide the \"raw data\" which must be explained by models of the QCD vacuum.\n\nA full solution of QCD should give a full description of the vacuum, confinement and the hadron spectrum. Lattice QCD is making rapid progress towards providing the solution as a systematically improvable numerical computation. However, approximate models of the QCD vacuum remain useful in more restricted domains. The purpose of these models is to make quantitative sense of some set of condensates and hadron properties such as masses and form factors.\n\nThis section is devoted to models. Opposed to these are systematically improvable computational procedures such as large QCD and lattice QCD, which are described in their own articles.\n\nThe Savvidy vacuum is a model of the QCD vacuum which at a basic level is a statement that it cannot be the conventional Fock vacuum empty of particles and fields. In 1977, George Savvidy showed that the QCD vacuum with zero field strength is unstable, and decays into a state with a calculable non vanishing value of the field. Since condensates are scalar, it seems like a good first approximation that the vacuum contains some non-zero but homogeneous field which gives rise to these condensates. However, Stanley Mandelstam showed that a homogeneous vacuum field is also unstable. The instability of a homogeneous gluon field was argued by Niels Kjær Nielsen and Poul Olesen in their 1978 paper. These arguments suggest that the scalar condensates are an effective long-distance description of the vacuum, and at short distances, below the QCD scale, the vacuum may have structure.\n\nIn a type II superconductor, electric charges condense into Cooper pairs. As a result, magnetic flux is squeezed into tubes. In the dual superconductor picture of the QCD vacuum, chromomagnetic monopoles condense into dual Cooper pairs, causing chromoelectric flux to be squeezed into tubes. As a result, confinement and the \"string picture\" of hadrons follows. This dual superconductor picture is due to Gerard 't Hooft and Stanley Mandelstam. 't Hooft showed further that an Abelian projection of a non-Abelian gauge theory contains magnetic monopoles.\n\nWhile the vortices in a type II superconductor are neatly arranged into a hexagonal or occasionally square lattice, as is reviewed in Olesen's 1980 seminar one may expect a much more complicated and possibly dynamical structure in QCD. For example, nonabelian Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices may vibrate wildly or be knotted.\n\nString models of confinement and hadrons have a long history. They were first invented to explain certain aspects of crossing symmetry in the scattering of two mesons. They were also found to be useful in the description of certain properties of the Regge trajectory of the hadrons. These early developments took on a life of their own called the dual resonance model (later renamed string theory). However, even after the development of QCD string models continued to play a role in the physics of strong interactions. These models are called \"non-fundamental strings\" or QCD strings, since they should be derived from QCD, as they are, in certain approximations such as the strong coupling limit of lattice QCD.\n\nThe model states that the colour electric flux between a quark and an antiquark collapses into a string, rather than spreading out into a Coulomb field as the normal electric flux does. This string also obeys a different force law. It behaves as if the string had constant tension, so that separating out the ends (quarks) would give a potential energy increasing linearly with the separation. When the energy is higher than that of a meson, the string breaks and the two new ends become a quark-antiquark pair, thus describing the creation of a meson. Thus confinement is incorporated naturally into the model.\n\nIn the form of the Lund model Monte Carlo program, this picture has had remarkable success in explaining experimental data collected in electron-electron and hadron-hadron collisions.\n\nStrictly, these models are not models of the QCD vacuum, but of physical single particle quantum states — the hadrons. The model proposed originally in 1974 by A. Chodos \"et al.\" \nconsists of inserting a quark model in a \"perturbative vacuum\" inside a volume of space called a bag. Outside this bag is the real QCD vacuum, whose effect is taken into account through the difference between energy density of the true QCD vacuum and the perturbative vacuum (bag constant ) and boundary conditions imposed on the quark wave functions and the gluon field. The hadron spectrum is obtained by solving the Dirac equation for quarks and the Yang–Mills equations for gluons. The wave functions of the quarks satisfy the boundary conditions of a fermion in an infinitely deep potential well of scalar type with respect to the Lorentz group. The boundary conditions for the gluon field are those of the dual color superconductor. The role of such a superconductor is attributed to the physical vacuum of QCD. Bag models strictly prohibit the existence of open color (free quarks, free gluons, etc.) and lead in particular to string models of hadrons.\n\nThe chiral bag model couples the axial vector current of the quarks at the bag boundary to a pionic field outside of the bag. In the most common formulation, the chiral bag model basically replaces the interior of the skyrmion with the bag of quarks. Very curiously, most physical properties of the nucleon become mostly insensitive to the bag radius. Prototypically, the baryon number of the chiral bag remains an integer, independent of bag radius: the exterior baryon number is identified with the topological winding number density of the Skyrme soliton, while the interior baryon number consists of the valence quarks (totaling to one) plus the spectral asymmetry of the quark eigenstates in the bag. The spectral asymmetry is just the vacuum expectation value summed over all of the quark eigenstates in the bag. Other values, such as the total mass and the axial coupling constant , are not precisely invariant like the baryon number, but are mostly insensitive to the bag radius, as long as the bag radius is kept below the nucleon diameter. Because the quarks are treated as free quarks inside the bag, the radius-independence in a sense validates the idea of asymptotic freedom.\n\nAnother view states that BPST-like instantons play an important role in the vacuum structure of QCD. These instantons were discovered in 1975 by Alexander Belavin, Alexander Markovich Polyakov, Albert S. Schwarz and Yu. S. Tyupkin as topologically stable solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations. They represent tunneling transitions from one vacuum state to another. These instantons are indeed found in lattice calculations. The first computations performed with instantons used the dilute gas approximation. The results obtained did not solve the infrared problem of QCD, making many physicists turn away from instanton physics. Later, though, an instanton liquid model was proposed, turning out to be more promising an approach.\n\nThe dilute instanton gas model departs from the supposition that the QCD vacuum consists of a gas of BPST-like instantons. Although only the solutions with one or few instantons (or anti-instantons) are known exactly, a dilute gas of instantons and anti-instantons can be approximated by considering a superposition of one-instanton solutions at great distances from one another. Gerard 't Hooft calculated the effective action for such an ensemble, and he found an infrared divergence for big instantons, meaning that an infinite amount of infinitely big instantons would populate the vacuum.\n\nLater, an instanton liquid model was studied. This model starts from the assumption that an ensemble of instantons cannot be described by a mere sum of separate instantons. Various models have been proposed, introducing interactions between instantons or using variational methods (like the \"valley approximation\") endeavoring to approximate the exact multi-instanton solution as closely as possible. Many phenomenological successes have been reached. Whether an instanton liquid can explain confinement in 3+1 dimensional QCD is not known, but many physicists think that it is unlikely.\n\nA more recent picture of the QCD vacuum is one in which center vortices play an important role. These vortices are topological defects carrying a center element as charge. These vortices are usually studied using lattice simulations, and it has been found that the behavior of the vortices is closely linked with the confinement–deconfinement phase transition: in the confinement phase vortices percolate and fill the spacetime volume, in the deconfinement phase they are much suppressed. Also it has been shown that the string tension vanished upon removal of center vortices from the simulations, hinting at an important role for center vortices.\n\n\n"}

It is located on Baie des Chaleurs near the mouth of the Bonaventure River. The town is situated on Route 132 between Saint-Siméon and New Carlisle.\n\nThe Quebec Acadian Museum (Musée Acadien du Québec) is located in the town.\n\nThe town was named after the Italian saint Bonaventure.\n\nThe first permanent European settlement of Bonaventure was in 1760 by Acadian refugees who had successfully avoided the expulsion of Acadians that had begun in 1755. Some of these early settlers were present at the Battle of Restigouche in July 1760, where a mixed force of French navy aided by Acadians were defeated by the Royal Navy. Many of today's Bonaventure residents are of Acadian descent.\n\nPrior to permanent settlement, the Bonaventure harbour had often been visited by Europeans and was the location of temporary camps and posts for many years before.\n\nAt the time of settlement, Bonaventure was located in lands possessed by France, but in 1763, after the Treaty of Paris, all of New France was ceded to Britain, and Bonaventure became part of British colony of the Province of Quebec. Later, some of the lands already settled by the Acadians were granted to anglophones, although after decades of petitioning the Quebéc government, some of the Acadian settlers were able to gain title to the lands they occupied. However, even as late as 1891, more than half of the homesteaders in this region had no legal title to the lands they lived on.\n\nBonaventure was raided by Americans during the War of Independence.\n\nMother tongue language (2011)\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2 furlongs (3 miles, 1 furlong and 214 yards, or 5,225 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December.\n\nThe event was established in 1957 as the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup, and it was initially staged at Cheltenham. The winner of the inaugural running, Mandarin, was owned by Peggy Hennessy, a member of the family which founded Hennessy, the race's sponsoring company. It was transferred to Newbury in 1960, and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961. The race's second running was won by Taxidermist, ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence, later Lord Oaksey, who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner, Carruthers.\n\nThe race's association with Hennessy continued until the 60th running, in 2016, and was British racing's longest-running commercial sponsorship at the time. The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup, which was first run seven months before the \"Hennessy\", and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001. Ladbrokes were announced as the new race sponsor in February 2017.\n\nThe race has been won by nine horses which have also won the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

{"id": "1967161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967161", "title": "Post-normal science", "text": "Post-normal science\n\nPost-normal science (PNS) represents a novel approach for the use of science on issues where \"facts [are] uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent\". PNS was developed in the 1990s by Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome R. Ravetz. It can be considered as a reaction to the styles of analysis based on risk and cost-benefit analysis prevailing at that time, and as an embodiment of concepts of a new \"critical science\" developed in previous works by the same authors. In a more recent work PNS is described as \"the stage where we are today, where all the comfortable assumptions about science, its production and its use, are in question\".\n\nAccording to its proponents Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome R. Ravetz, the name \"post-normal science\" echoes the seminal work on modern science by Thomas Kuhn. For Carrozza PNS can be \"framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’\", and as a \"reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople\". For Mike Hulme (2007), writing on \"The Guardian\" Climate change seems falls into the category of issues which are best dealt with in the context of PNS and notes that \"Disputes in post-normal science focus as often on the process of science - who gets funded, who evaluates quality, who has the ear of policy - as on the facts of science\".\nFrom the ecological perspective post-normal science can be situated in the context of 'crisis disciplines' – a term coined by the conservation biologist Michael E. Soulé to indicate approaches addressing fears, emerging in the seventies, that the world was on the verge of ecological collapse. In this respect Michael Egan defines PNS as a 'survival science'. More recently PNS has been defined as a movement of ‘informed critical resistance, reform and the making of futures’.\n\nMoving from PNS Ziauddin Sardar developed the concept of Postnormal Times (PNT). Sardar was the editor of FUTURES when it published the article ‘Science for the post-normal age’ presently the most cited paper of the journal. A recent review of academic literature conducted on the Web of Science and encompassing the topics of Futures studies, Foresight, Forecasting and Anticipation Practice identifies the same paper as \"the all-time publication that received the highest number of citations\".\n\n\"At birth Post-normal science was conceived as an inclusive set of robust insights more than as an exclusive fully structured theory or field of practice\". Some of the ideas underpinning PNS can already be found in a work published in 1983 and entitled \"Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis\" This and subsequent works show that PNS concentrates on few aspects of the complex relation between science and policy: the communication of uncertainty, the assessment of quality, and the justification and practice of the extended peer communities.\n\nComing to the PNS diagram (figure above) the horizontal axis represents ‘Systems Uncertainties’ and the vertical one ‘Decision Stakes’. The three quadrants identify Applied Science, Professional Consultancy, and Post-Normal Science. Different standards of quality and styles of analysis are appropriate to different regions in the diagram, i.e. Post-normal science does not claim relevance and cogency on all of science's application but only on those defined by the PNS's mantram with a fourfold challenge: ‘facts uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’. For applied research science's own peer quality control system will suffice (or so was assumed at the moment PNS was formulated in the early nineties), while professional consultancy was considered appropriate for these settings which cannot be ‘peer-reviewed’, and where the skills and the tacit knowledge of a practitioner are needed at the forefront, e.g. in a surgery room, or in a house on fire. Here a surgeon or a fireman takes a difficult technical decision based on her or his training and appreciation of the situation (the Greek concept of ‘Metis’).\n\nThere are important linkages between PNS and complexity science, e.g. system ecology (C. S. Holling) and hierarchy theory (Arthur Koestler). In PNS, complexity is respected through its recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate perspectives on any issue; and reflexivity is realised through the extension of accepted ‘facts’ beyond the supposedly objective productions of traditional research. Also, the new participants in the process are not treated as passive learners at the feet of the experts, being coercively convinced through scientific demonstration. Rather, they will form an ‘extended peer community’, sharing the work of quality assurance of the scientific inputs to the process, and arriving at a resolution of issues through debate and dialogue. The necessity to embrace complexity in a post normal perspective to understand and face zoonoses is argumented by David Waltner-Toews.\n\nPNS concept of extended peer community moves from and transcends the familiar concept of scientific peer community relative to a well-defined field of scientific research.\nThe peer community is extended in two respects: first, more than one discipline is assumed to have a potential bearing on the issue being debated, thereby providing different lenses to consider the problem. Second the community is extended to lay actors, taken to be all those with stakes, or an interest, in the given issue. Perhaps the best justification of the concept is offered by Paul Feyerabend in Against Method. For Feyerabend the participation of experts together with non-experts would allow the citizens to mature, inter alia by realizing that the experts are themselves lay-people outside their restricted field of competence. For Giandomenico Majone \"In any area of public policy the choice of instruments, far from being a technical exercise that can be safely delegated to the experts, reflects as in a microcosm all the political, moral, and cultural dimensions of policy-making.\" The same author notes: \"Dialectical confrontation between generalists and experts often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions, conflicting interpretations of the facts, and the risks posed by the projects\". These considerations justifies the need for an extended peer community, as the arena where the policy instruments and options can be discussed with - but without deference to - the experts and the authorities.\n\nThe lay members of the community thus constituted may also take upon themselves active 'research' tasks; this has happened e.g. in the so-called 'popular epidemiology', when the official authorities have shown reticence to perform investigations deemed necessary by the communities affected - for example - by a case of air or water pollution, and more recently ‘citizen science’. The extended community can usefully investigate the quality of the scientific assessments provided by the experts, the definition of the problem, as well as research priorities and research questions.\n\nThus, the extension of the peer community is not only ethically fair or politically correct, but also enhances the quality of the relevant science. An example is provided by Brian Wynne, who discusses the Cumbrian sheep farmers' interaction with scientist and authorities in the relation to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout.\n\nThe concept of extended peer community was developed in the context of politicised quality controversies in science (such as 'housewife' or 'popular' epidemiology ), early evidence-based medicine (the Cochrane collaboration), and the total quality management ideas of W. Edwards Deming, in particular quality circles.\n\nBeside its dominating influence in the literature on 'futures', PNS is considered to have influenced the ecological ‘conservation versus preservation debate’, especially via its reading by American pragmatist Bryan G. Norton. According to Jozef Keulartz the PNS concept of \"extended peer community\" influenced how Norton's developed his 'convergence hypothesis'. The hypothesis posits that ecologists of different orientation will converge once they start thinking 'as a mountain', or as a planet. For Norton this will be achieved via deliberative democracy, which will pragmatically overcome the black and white divide between conservationists and preservationists. More recently it has been argued that conservation science, embedded as it is in a multi-layered governance structures of policy-makers, practitioners, and stakeholders, is itself an 'extended peer community', and as a result conservation has always been ‘post-normal’.\n\nOther authors attribute to PNS the role of having stimulated the take up of transdisciplinary methodological frameworks, reliant on the social constructivist perspective embedded in PNS.\n\nToday Post-normal science is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values. Typical instances are in the use of evidence based policy and in evaluation.\n\nAs summarized in a recent work \"the ideas and concepts of post normal science bring about the emergence of new problem solving strategies in which the role of science is appreciated in its full context of the complexity and the uncertainty of natural systems and the relevance of human commitments and values.\"\n\nFor Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including \"eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability\".\n\nRecent reviews of the history and evolution of PNS, its definitions, conceptualizations,\nand uses can be found in Turnpenny et al., 2010, and in The Routledge Handbook of Ecological Economics (Nature and Society). There has been recently an increased reference to post-normal science, e.g. in Nature \n\nA criticism of post-normal science is offered by Weingart (1997) for whom Post-normal science does not introduce a new epistemology but retraces earlier debates linked to the so-called \"finalization thesis\". For Jörg Friedrichs – comparing the issues of climate change and peak energy – an extension of the peer community has taken place in the climate science community, transforming climate scientists into ‘stealth advocates’, while scientists working on energy security – without PNS, would still maintain their credentials of neutrality and objectivity. Another criticism is that the extended peer community's use undermines the scientific method's use of empiricism and that its goal would be better addressed by providing greater science education.\n\nIt has been argued that PNS scholars have been prescient in anticipating the present crisis in science's quality control and reproducibility. A group of scholars of PNS orientation has published in 2016 a volume on the topic, discussing \"inter alia\" what this community perceive as the root causes of the present science's crisis. A World View piece published by Jerome R. Ravetz on the journal Nature in 2019 touches upon whether the way science is taught should be reconsidered.\n\nAmong the quantitative styles of analysis which make reference to post-normal science one can mention NUSAP for numerical information, sensitivity auditing for indicators and mathematical modelling, Quantitative storytelling for exploring multiple frames in a quantitative analysis, and MUSIASEM in the field of social metabolism. A work where these approaches are suggested for sustainability is in .\n\nIn relation to mathematical modelling PNS suggests a participatory approach, whereby ‘models to predict and control the future’ are replaced by ‘models to map our ignorance about the future’, in the process exploring and revealing the metaphors embedded in the model. PNS is also known for its definition of GIGO: in modelling GIGO occurs when the uncertainties in the inputs must be suppressed, lest the outputs become completely indeterminate.\n\nWhat is PNS' reading of the COVID-19 pandemic? On March 25, i.e. in the midst of the crisis, a group of scholars of post-normal orientation published on the blog section of the STEPS_Centre (for Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) at the University of Sussex. The piece argues that the COVID-19 emergency has all the elements of a post normal science context, and notes that \"This pandemic offers society an occasion to open a fresh discussion on whether we now need to learn how to do science in a different way\".\n\nThe journal FUTURES devoted several specials issues to PNS.\n\n\n\nAnother special issue on Post Normal Science was published on the journal Science, Technology & Human Values in May 2011.\n\n"}
