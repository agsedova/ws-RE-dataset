{"id": "1971132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971132", "title": "Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones", "text": "Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones\n\nFire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems, and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console in 2004 for Japan and 2005 in the West. It is the eighth entry in the \"Fire Emblem\" series, the second to be released outside Japan, and the third and final title to be developed for the Game Boy Advance after \"\" and its prequel \"Fire Emblem\".\n\nSet in a separate continuity to earlier \"Fire Emblem\" titles, \"The Sacred Stones\" takes place on the fictional continent of Magvel, which is divided into five nations, each built around a magical stone said to be linked to the imprisonment of an ancient demon. When one of the five nations, the Grado Empire, invades its neighbors and begins destroying the stones, protagonists Eirika and Ephraim of the royal family of Renais set out to gather allies and halt Grado's conquest, while also trying to uncover the reasons for the war. The gameplay is similar to previous \"Fire Emblem\" games, focusing on turn-based, tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield. Core features of the game include permanent death for characters defeated in battle and support conversations that grant advantages to certain units in battle.\n\n\"The Sacred Stones\" began development alongside \"\" as a side project, sharing much of its visual design and mechanics with \"Fire Emblem\" while incorporating elements from earlier entries such as \"Fire Emblem Gaiden\". First announced in mid-2004, it was heavily promoted in Japan. When released, it sold over 230,000 units during 2004, with a further 90,000 being sold upon its North American debut. Reception was positive overall for its story and gameplay, although many critics cited it as being too similar to its predecessor. \"The Sacred Stones\" would be the last original handheld \"Fire Emblem\" title until \"Fire Emblem Awakening\" for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.\n\n\"Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones\" is a tactical role-playing game where players take the role of royal siblings Eirika and Ephraim during separate campaigns as they fight hostile forces invading their homeland, along with allies acquired on their journey. The world's setting of Magvel is navigated using an overworld map, with routes going to different battle maps unlocked as the story progresses. In addition to story-related maps and dungeons, optional dungeons exist where chosen units can freely battle enemies, earning experience points. Each time a unit earns 100 experience points, that unit will gain a level and some of their stats will randomly increase. All characters can progress up to the 20-level cap. After a character has leveled up to 10, it has the option to be evolved using a class-specific item. A notable change from earlier games is that multiple options are available for class evolution: for instance, a Cavalier can evolve into either a Paladin or a Great Knight.\n\nBattles use a turn-based system, with player, allied, and enemy units each taking turns to moving across a grid-based battlefield. Players can end their turn at any time, at which point the allied or enemy units can move. In each battle, the player is given command of a limited number of units and an objective to complete. Each unit's character class determines their abilities, available weapons, strength, and range of movement. For example, mounted characters can move within the remainder of their movement range if they traded with or assisted another player unit in a shorter range. Other units have the ability to \"rescue\" units, lowering their own stats while removing the rescued unit from harm. Depending on a unit's class and stats, items can be used heal or inflict status ailments such as \"Poison\" (a unit loses health each turn), \"Berserk\" (a unit attacks nearby units regardless of association), and immobilization ailments such as \"Sleep\" and \"Petrify\".\n\nA key element of battle is the Weapons Triangle, a rock-paper-scissors mechanic governing which type of weapon is more effective against another. Weapon types vary from close-range melee weapons like swords and axes to long-range weapons such as bows and magical staves. Various items gathered during missions, such as healing items and weapons, can be traded with other units within the army, or sold at vendors found on the world map. All items degrade with use and will break after a certain number of uses. Different weapons also feature a minimum skill level for use, requiring units to train with that weapon type to earn the proper rank, which ranges from E to A, and then to S, the highest rank. When a unit reaches S rank with one weapon, all other weapon skills are locked at A rank.\n\nCertain units which share a particular affinity stat can benefit from mid-battle Support Conversations. After spending a certain number of turns within a few spaces of each other, they gain the option to engage in a Support Conversation when occupying adjacent spaces. Each pair of units can have up to three Support Conversations, with each successive Support granting both units better stat bonuses in future battles if they are within three spaces of each other.\n\nWhen a unit falls in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from the rest of the campaign unless the player restarts the game from a previous save file. Some character deaths, such as those of Eirika and Ephraim, end the game and require a restart from a save file.\n\nIn addition to the single-player, the game includes a local multiplayer option where four players can take chosen units into the Link Arena. Victory goes to the last group standing or to the party with the highest score depending on the match conditions. Permanent death is disabled in the Link Arena.\n\n\"The Sacred Stones\" is set on the continent of Magvel, which is divided into six nations. Long ago, five of these nations were each given charge of one of five magical gemstones called the Sacred Stones. The Stones were used to seal away the soul of the Demon King Fomortiis at the end of a conflict between humans and monsters over 800 years ago. The game begins when the Grado Empire, largest of the five founding nations, launches an unexpected assault on the neighboring nation of Renais, home of the royal siblings Eirika and Ephraim. Taken by surprise, Renais is defeated and the two siblings are separated: Eirika escapes to the northern nation of Frelia with the king's general Seth, while Ephraim goes underground to mount a resistance against the Grado Empire to the South. As Eirika seeks aid from the other nations and gathers allies, the land becomes plagued with undead monsters, a sign of Fomortiis's return. She is eventually reunited with Ephraim, and the two discover that Grado plans to destroy the Sacred Stones and unleash Fomortiis once more. After failed attempts to contact Grado's Prince Lyon, the twins' closest friend, they are forced to mobilize against their former ally as the Empire turns its attention to the other nations' Sacred Stones, successfully destroying the Stone of Frelia.\n\nThe siblings part ways once again, each on a mission to preserve the Stones. Eirika is forced to reach the allied nation of Rausten by passing through the new republic of Carcino, the sixth nation, and secret ally of Grado. Her forces escape Carcino by passing through the desert nation of Jehanna, where the Stone of Jehanna is destroyed and Eirika is cornered by two legions of Grado's army. Meanwhile, Ephraim is joined by allies from the nations of Frelia and within Grado itself, and they fight their way into the heart of the empire, to the very throne of Grado's emperor, Vigarde. After defeating Vigarde in battle, Prince Lyon appears and reveals that the Emperor was merely a resurrected puppet, and that he had started the war. When Vigarde died of illness months before, Lyon had feared his inability to rule Grado and became desperate to bring his father back. Lyon sacrificed his nation's Sacred Stone to revive the Emperor's body, but inadvertently absorbed the fragment of the Demon King's shattered soul sealed within. Lyon became a slave to the Demon King's will, and Vigarde a soulless puppet. Lyon declares that he will once more rule Magvel once the Stones are destroyed. With this revealed, he vanishes. Burdened with this knowledge, Ephraim heads to Jehenna and rescues Eirika.\n\nOnce reunited, the siblings gather their forces and liberate Renais, retrieving its true Sacred Stone, which had been replaced by a decoy when Grado invaded. After gathering reinforcements from Frelia, the twins head east to Rausten, hoping to protect its Sacred Stone. On the way, the twins are confronted by Lyon, who bests the twins and finally destroys Renais' true Sacred Stone. The twins manage to escape and retrieve the last intact Sacred Stone from Rausten. The siblings pursue Lyon to the Darkling Woods, where he is performing a ritual which will resurrect the Demon King. The twins do battle with Lyon and finally kill their former friend, inadvertently supplying him as the final sacrifice that resurrects the Demon King. Eirika and Ephraim use the Sacred Stone of Rausten to seal the Demon King's soul, and then their forces destroy its body. The siblings' allies from the other nations return home, while they themselves seal the final Sacred Stone away and set about restoring their nation.\n\n\"The Sacred Stones\" was produced by long-time developer Intelligent Systems, running parallel to the development of \"\", an entry for the GameCube. According to staff, development began unexpectedly in 2003 alongside \"Path of Radiance\": the staff thought they would not be developing another entry for the Game Boy Advance. Production on the two titles ran parallel to each other. In addition to Intelligent Systems staff, freelance staff were brought in to help with development, including former Capcom developers. Character designs were done by Sachiko Wada, who had previously worked on \"The Binding Blade\" and \"The Blazing Blade\", the latter localized as \"Fire Emblem\". She also acted as the game's director. A second character designer was Ryo Hirata, a designer who had worked on \"The Blazing Blade\", in addition to projects for animation studio Production I.G. The scenario was written by Kouhei Maeda. The majority of the gameplay systems designed for \"Fire Emblem\" were carried over into \"The Sacred Stones\", barring some minor additions. Some of its gameplay mechanics were borrowed from the 1992 entry \"Fire Emblem Gaiden\", along with other unspecified mechanics from the Super Famicom entries. It was later stated that the inclusion of these elements was a deliberate tribute to \"Gaiden\" by the staff. The series' titular \"Fire Emblem\", which takes different forms across each \"Fire Emblem\" universe, appears in \"The Sacred Stones\" as the gemstone kept by the Grado Empire, which was used to seal the Demon King's soul. Its setting of Magvel is the only setting within the \"Fire Emblem\" series to date which remains unconnected to another title. \"The Sacred Stones\" would be the last \"Fire Emblem\" game to be developed for the Game Boy Advance, along with being the last original \"Fire Emblem\" on handheld devices until \"Fire Emblem Awakening\" in 2012 for Nintendo 3DS.\n\n\"The Sacred Stones\" was first announced in Japan in June 2004, scheduled for release in Autumn that year. It released in Japan on October 7, 2004. To promote its release, a special commercial was created for broadcast in September of that year: it involved a girl playing on a Game Boy Advance being drawn into the worlds of the \"Fire Emblem\" series. Two guidebooks were also published focusing on the game, the first on October 21 and the second on November 17. A Western release was first hinted at in a Nintendo report, revealing its prospective release of both \"Path of Radiance\" and what would turn out to be \"The Sacred Stones\". It was released in 2005 in North America and Europe, May 23 and November 4 respectively. \"The Sacred Stones\" was the second \"Fire Emblem\" to be released in both North America and Europe. According to Nintendo Treehouse staff members Tim O'Leary and Alan Averill, \"The Sacred Stones\" was an easier game to localize for as it had less text content than its predecessor. The move from the first Western game to \"The Sacred Stones\" and \"Path of Radiance\" meant that any work on localizing \"The Binding Blade\" could not be managed. The title was later re-released as part of Nintendo's promotional \"3DS Ambassador Program\" as a free download on December 16, 2011. It was later re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console: it was released in Japan on August 6, 2014, the PAL regions on January 1, 2015, and in North America on June 18 the same year.\n\nUpon its day of release in Japan, \"The Sacred Stones\" sold 97,842 units, achieving a sell-through rate of just over 64%. By the end of 2004, the game had sold 233,280 units, reaching #48 in \"Famitsu\"s annual video game sales rankings. In North America, \"The Sacred Stones\" was among the top 20 games in the Nintendo hardware charts, with sales of 96,000 units. Although no exact total sales figures have been published, Nintendo cited the game as being among its successful Game Boy Advance titles for 2005.\n\n\"Famitsu\" praised the story, with one reviewer saying the characters had a tasteful charm. Karen Chu of 1UP.com said the story shone through, keeping players from burning out after the battle segments. IGN's Craig Harris called the storytelling \"absolutely top-notch, if just a little wordy for comfort\", praising the writing for making him care about his characters. David Chapman of GameSpy noted the storyline being rich. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin said that \"The Sacred Stones\" had \"a well-written, surprisingly sophisticated narrative featuring plenty of endearing heroes and villains\". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell called the storytelling \"wonderful\", positively noting the more exotic narrative when compared to its predecessor. Simon Parkin, writing for \"NGC Magazine\", praised the game's \"delightful, uncurling narrative\", and positively noted the translation quality as it helped him understand the workings of the game's world and characters. PALGN reviewer Mark Marrow said the story was a step above its predecessor, calling it \"a beautiful narrative featuring plenty of action from villains and heroes, and even some comic relief in-between all of this\". Matthew Foster of RPGamer, while noting the quality of the translation, said that the story was the game's weakest point due to its cliched nature. RPGFan's Alan Knight called the plot \"light and fairly easy-going\", noting its eccentric characters eased players along.\n\nSpeaking about the gameplay, \"Famitsu\" enjoyed the tactical gameplay and new elements, along with appreciating the thrill induced by permadeath. A minor criticism was issues with the pacing. Harris enjoyed the gameplay despite noting that little had changed since the release of \"Fire Emblem\", saying that players would not find any notable changes from their original experience. Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of \"Fire Emblem\", along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy gameplay, and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels. Foster called the gameplay the game's biggest feature and greatest strength despite not having changed much since the previous game. Knight enjoyed the gameplay experience, but was mixed to negative about the lack of true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier \"Fire Emblem\" games. Bramwell enjoyed the gameplay despite getting frustrated with permadeath and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large amounts of time creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.\n"}

The term \"Hamburg School\" as an astrological method originated in 1923 at the Second German Astrological Congress in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nThe Hamburg School was established as an Association as \"Astrologenverein Hamburger Schule\" on October 31, 1925 at 9h45'51\" PM (-1 = GMT), in Hamburg/Germany. In 1932 the first partner group was established in Düsseldorf/Germany by Theodor Keysers.\n\nEarly collaborators of Alfred Witte were Friedrich Sieggrün and Ludwig Rudolph. In his search for Pluto, Witte claimed four planets beyond Pluto, and Sieggrün claimed yet another four. These bodies are in the Transneptunian regions, where many planetary discoveries are being validated today. These astrologically derived transneptunian factors have as of 2009 neither been proven nor disproven to be among what astronomers have generically labeled Transneptunians, or Kuiper Belt, Scattered Disk Objects, or Oort Cloud phenomena, as further research on this region remains to be done. Witte promoted the use of the transneptunian hypothetical planets, meaning none of the Witte transneptunian planets were astronomically verifiable at the time in which he discovered them nor have they been verified by astronomers at any time since he proposed their existence. Witte's transneptunian planets were, Cupido, Hades, Zeus and Kronos. In 1927, Sieggrün expanded the list of transneptunian hypothetical planets to include Apollon, Admetos, Vulkanus and Poseidon (1934), beyond what Witte himself perceived to exist.\n\nIn the 1930s the American Richard Svehla became official advocate of “Hamburg School” and created the term “Uranian Astrology” for the US in 1936.\n\nLudwig Rudolph printed and published Witte's findings, the core of which were published in the \"Rulesbook for Planetary Pictures\" (\"Regelwerk für Planetenbilder\") in 1928. An increasing amount of the research of the Hamburg School revolved around work with astrological midpoints and use of the extra planets.\n\nUnfortunately, Witte and Rudolph were pursued by the Gestapo as enemies of the Third Reich. Alfred Witte committed suicide before being sent to a concentration camp, and Ludwig Rudolph was indeed interned, the \"Rulebook for Planetary Pictures\" banned and burned by the Nazis.\n\nReinhold Ebertin, a (unofficial) student of Hamburg School methods, eliminated the use of the hypothetical trans-neptunian objects while maintaining the core teachings of the Hamburg School, renamed them \"Cosmobiology\" (), and published them in \"The Combination of Stellar Influences\" in 1940, last updated in English in 1972.\n\nAfter the fall of the Third Reich, the Hamburg School reconvened, and Ludwig Rudolph played the key role in perpetuating the teachings of the Hamburg School. The Hamburg School astrologer Hermann Lefeldt combined Witte's theories with more astrological traditions such as the use of astrological houses. However, other Hamburg practitioners maintained their focus on working only with astrological midpoints , abandoning traditional practices, including the 12 houses and rulerships.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the Dean of the Cambridge Muslim College, Aziz Foundation Professor of Islamic Studies at both Cambridge Muslim College and Ebrahim College, Director of Studies (Theology and Religious Studies) at Wolfson College and the Shaykh Zayed Lecturer in Islamic Studies at University of Cambridge. His work includes publications on Islamic theology and Muslim-Christian relations. In 2003 he was awarded the Pilkington Teaching Prize by Cambridge University and in 2007 he was awarded the King Abdullah I Prize for Islamic Thought for his short booklet \"Bombing Without Moonlight\". He has consistently been included in The 500 Most Influential Muslims list published annually by the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought and was ranked in 2012 as the 50th most influential. Most recently in the 2020 Edition of The 500 Most Influential Muslims, Winter was ranked the 48th most influential Muslim in the world.\n\nWinter is the son of an architect and artist.\n\nWinter was educated at Westminster School and graduated with a double-first in Arabic from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1983. He then went on to study at Al Azhar University in Cairo and further private study with individual scholars in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. After returning to England, he studied Turkish and Persian at the University of London.\n\nIn 2009 Winter helped to open the Cambridge Muslim College, an institute designed to train British imams. Winter also directs the Anglo-Muslim Fellowship for Eastern Europe, and the Sunna Project which has published the foremost scholarly Arabic editions of the major Sunni Hadith collections. He serves as the secretary of the Muslim Academic Trust. Winter is active in translating key Islamic texts into English including a translation of two volumes of the Islamic scholar al-Ghazali's \"Ihya Ulum al-Din\". His academic publications include many articles on Islamic theology and Muslim-Christian relations as well as two books in Turkish on political theology. His book reviews sometimes appear in the \"Times Literary Supplement\". He is also the editor of the \"Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology\" (2008) and author of \"Bombing without Moonlight\", which in 2007 was awarded the King Abdullah I Prize for Islamic Thought. Winter is also a contributor to BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day. Additionally, Winter is one of the signatories of A Common Word Between Us and You, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding.\n\nWinter is the founder and leader of the Cambridge Central Mosque project which is working to develop a new purpose built mosque in Cambridge to cater for up to 1,000 worshipers. The mosque is planned to be entirely reliant on green energy with an almost-zero carbon footprint. Regarding the project, Winter stated, \"This will be a very substantial world class landmark building in what is considered by some to be a down-at-heel part of Cambridge.\"\n\nWinter is a traditionalist and considers the views of extremists like al-Qaeda as religiously illegitimate and inauthentic. He decries the failure of extremists to adhere to the classical canons of Islamic law and theology and denounces their fatwas. He unequivocally rejects suicide bombing and considers the killing of noncombatants as always forbidden, noting that some sources consider it worse than murder. According to Winter, Osama bin Laden and his right-hand man Ayman al-Zawahiri are un-Islamic, unqualified vigilantes who violate basic Islamic teachings.\n\nWinter is critical of Western foreign policy for fueling anger and resentment in the Muslim world. He is equally critical of Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi ideology, which he believes gives extremists a theological pretext for their extremism and violence.\n\nWinter's younger brother is football writer Henry Winter.\n\nIn January 2015, Winter was nominated for the Services to Education award at the British Muslim Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

With the club for 21 years, and winning the 1980 FA Cup Martin left West Ham in 1996 and played one season with Leyton Orient before moving into football management with Southend United. This lasted two seasons before he started a career in the media on radio station talkSPORT and also as a pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows.\nPlaying 17 times for England during the 1980s, Martin represented them at the 1986 World Cup.\n\nBorn in Walton, Liverpool, Lancashire, Martin played schools football for Bootle and Lancashire and was attached to Merseyside club Everton as a schoolboy, but left in 1974 after the Goodison Park club only offered him an apprenticeship on a part-time basis. An unsuccessful trial later that summer with Queens Park Rangers was followed the very next day by one for West Ham United, where he was awarded a contract as an apprentice 19 August 1974. He appeared in the FA Youth cup final of 1975 and signed as a professional on 29 July 1976. He did not make his first team debut until 18 March 1978 as a substitute against Aston Villa. His final appearance was as an 88th-minute substitute on 5 May 1996 against Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nMartin went on to amass nearly 600 first-team appearances for the Hammers in a successful 19-year professional career at Upton Park, in which he became one of only two players, along with Billy Bonds, to be awarded two testimonials. The first was against Spurs on 21 August 1988 and the second against Chelsea on 11 November 1995. It was alongside Bonds in the centre of defence that Martin – nicknamed 'Stretch' – enjoyed his most rewarding years, winning the FA Cup and Second Division winners medals in successive seasons, 1980 and 1981.\n\nMartin also achieved the rare feat of scoring a hat-trick against three different Newcastle United goalkeepers – Martin Thomas, who was then injured, and outfield players Chris Hedworth and Peter Beardsley – in a Football League First Division match in April 1986 which the Hammers won 8–1. This was among the most successful seasons the club ever saw, as it finished third in the top level, just four points behind champions Liverpool, with the player contributing with 40 games and four goals.\n\nMartin remained loyal to West Ham despite their relegation from the top flight in 1989, and helped them gain promotion two years later. The club lasted just one season before again dropping down a level, only to bounce back at the first attempt. Martin, for decades the club's longest serving player, spent three more years with the team in the Premier League before finally departing at the end of the 1995–96 season after 21 years service, aged 37.\nAfter leaving West Ham, Martin had a brief spell with East London neighbours Leyton Orient, before managing Southend United for two years, during which the club was relegated to the League One.\n\nMartin was given his first England cap by Ron Greenwood against Brazil at Wembley in May 1981. Injury ruled him out of the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals in Spain, but he was playing some of the finest football of his career when the next manager, Bobby Robson, included him in his squad for the 1986 edition in Mexico: he played in the victory over Paraguay, replacing the suspended Terry Fenwick, but was dropped for the next game, the quarter-final defeat by Argentina's infamous 'Hand of God'; in total, he made 17 international appearances.\n\nAfter retiring from management, he joined national radio station talkSPORT, while also being a regular pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows.\n\n\n\nMartin's sons, David and Joe, are also footballers. The former is a goalkeeper, whilst the latter is a defender.\n\n"}

It was produced by Big Finish Productions for BBCi, which was then the interactive television service arm of the BBC, and was originally webcast on the BBC \"Doctor Who\" website from 2 August – 6 September 2002.\n\"Real Time\", along with the other Doctor Who webcast animations, \"Shada\" and \"Death Comes To Time\", has been uploaded to YouTube.\n\nThere has been a series of mysterious vanishings on the desert planet Chronos in the 33rd century. Survey teams working for a university seem to have simply vanished amongst the pyramids on the planet. Alongside two other survey teams and an expert on cybernetics, the Doctor and Evelyn learn the deadly truth: that the planet Chronos is being used as a base for one of the Doctor's oldest and deadliest foes — the Cybermen.\n\n\nAfter the success of the first online webcast story, \"Death Comes to Time\", it was decided that a second would involve Big Finish Productions, who were already doing a number of audio plays involving members of \"Doctor Who\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> original cast. This webcast would involve Colin Baker playing the Sixth Doctor accompanied by Maggie Stables as Dr Evelyn Smythe, his companion in the Big Finish audio plays.\n\nThe limited bandwidth allowed by broadcasting across the Internet meant that writer and director Gary Russell approached the story with the edict that it would be shorter than many of the Big Finish plays. He decided that the story would therefore run, more or less, in \"real time\", with its complete 60-minute running time being exactly how long the Doctor would be involved within the story. The webcast was accompanied by very limited animation based on illustrations by artist Lee Sullivan.\n\nThe storyline was left without a definitive conclusion, allowing for a possible sequel to be made at a future date. However, the following webcast was a remake of the uncompleted 1979 serial \"Shada\", written by Douglas Adams. When BBCi decided to take the production of the next webcast, \"Scream of the Shalka\", completely in-house, this led to a brief falling out between Big Finish and BBCi, and any plans for a sequel to \"Real Time\" were shelved at that point. This extended to Russell even suggesting that \"Real Time\" be considered non-canon as far as the audio plays were concerned.\n\nAn extended version was released on CD in December 2002 by Big Finish, minus the illustrations/animation that had been included in the webcast but with the addition of further scenes designed to help the plot along, including an opening scene set inside the TARDIS.\n\nCharacter Options released a special figure of the Sixth Doctor in his \"toned down\"\nblue suit as part of its Doctor Who \"Classic\" 5\" action figure series.\n\nA second action figure of the Sixth Doctor in his blue outfit was released in 2016, as part of a set including all 13 incarnations of the Doctor. This version is far more detailed than the first, featuring multiple shades of blue.\n\n"}
{"id": "1971172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971172", "title": "No audible release", "text": "No audible release\n\nA stop with no audible release, also known as an unreleased stop or an applosive, is a stop consonant with no release burst: no audible indication of the end of its occlusion (hold). In the International Phonetic Alphabet, lack of an audible release is denoted with an upper-right corner diacritic () after the consonant letter: , , .\n\nAudibly released stops, on the other hand, are not normally indicated. If a final stop is aspirated, the aspiration diacritic is sufficient to indicate the release. Otherwise, the \"unaspirated\" diacritic of the Extended IPA may be employed for this: \"apt\" .\n\nIn most dialects of English, the first stop of a cluster has no audible release, as in \"apt\" , \"doctor\" , or \"logged on\" . Although such sounds are frequently described as \"unreleased\", the reality is that since the two consonants overlap, the release of the former takes place during the hold of the latter, masking the former's release and making it inaudible. That can lead to cross-articulations that seem very much like deletions or complete assimilation.\n\nFor example, \"hundred pounds\" may sound like but X-ray and electropalatographic studies demonstrate that since inaudible and possibly-weakened contacts may still be made, the second in \"hundred pounds\" does not entirely assimilate a labial place of articulation but co-occurs with it.\n\nIn American English, a stop in syllable-final position is typically realized as an unreleased stop; that is especially the case for /t/, but in that position, it is also analyzed as experiencing glottal reinforcement. \n\nSuch sounds may occur between vowels, as in some pronunciations of \"out a lot\". The overlap there appears to be with a glottal stop, : the is pronounced, and since it is between vowels, it must be released. However, its release is masked by the glottal stop. (See: T-glottalization, in some dialects).\n\nThe term \"unreleased\" is also used for a stop before a homorganic nasal, as in \"catnip\". In such cases, however, the stop is released as a nasal in a \"nasal release\" and so it would be more precisely transcribed .\n\nIn most languages in East and Southeast Asia with final stops, such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Korean, Malay, Thai, and West Coast Bajau, the stops are not audibly released: \"mak\" . That is true even between vowels. That is thought to be caused by an overlapping glottal stop and is more precisely transcribed . A consequence of an inaudible release is that any aspirated–unaspirated distinction is neutralized. Some languages, such as Vietnamese, which are reported to have unreleased final stops, turn out to have short voiceless nasal releases instead. The excess pressure is released (voicelessly) through the nose and so there is no audible release to the stop.\n\nThe Formosan languages of Taiwan, such as Tsou and Amis, are unusual in that all obstruents are released but not aspirated, as in Tsou \"four\" and \"to pierce\", or Amis \"one\" and \"four\".

Originally, it was intended to become the regional office of the Main Technical Organization (\"Naczelna Organizacja Techniczna, NOT\") and be named the NOT Tower. The construction of the building was started in 1975, but stopped permanently in 1981 because of economic constraints and political unrest associated with the imposition of martial law in Poland in that year. \nUnity Tower is located near the Mogilskie Roundabout (\"Rondo Mogilskie\") and Cracow University of Economics. It is the second tallest building in Kraków after K1 and excluding antennas.

His primary position was as a right-back, though he was also able to play in central defence.\n\nBeye joined Paris Saint-Germain in 1997, though he progressed no further than the reserve side, playing in the national fifth division. He transferred at the end of the season to RC Strasbourg in 1998 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nFollowing his summer move to RC Strasbourg in 1998, Beye made his league debut on 8 August 1998 in a home 0–0 draw against Olympique Lyonnais, and played a total of 23 times in his first season at the club. He missed just five league matches in the following season, and netted for the first time on 2 October 1999 in a 2–2 home draw with Bordeaux. He was a member of the RC Strasbourg side that won the 2001 French Cup, eventually defeating third division Amiens SC in a penalty shoot-out, which helped his team achieve UEFA Cup qualification in the following season. He appeared a total of 134 times in the league for Strasbourg, scoring 8 goals, before moving to Olympique Marseille in 2003, a move which surprised many as he was a firm favourite at Strasbourg and had established himself as a key player there.\n\nBeye signed for Olympique Marseille in the summer of 2003 for a reported €2.5million, by then manager Alain Perrin. In his opening season with the club, he took part in both UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup football. He was a key player for the Marseille side that reached the 2004 UEFA Cup Final, a run which involved him putting in a star performance as a central defender against (his now former team) Newcastle United, where he was particularly effective against Newcastle's talisman striker Alan Shearer. He ended up on the losing side as Marseille lost the final to Valencia 2–0. He was also a beaten finalist in the 2006 French Cup against former club Paris Saint-Germain, a match which his team lost 2–1, and again in 2007 when his Marseille team lost on penalties to FC Sochaux. His time with Marseille was a successful one where he established himself as one of the most accomplished defenders in France's top tier and was voted the fans’ Player of the Year in 2006. He was captain of the club for two years prior to his move to Newcastle United.\n\nBeye signed for Newcastle United for a fee of £2million (€3million) on 31 August 2007, during the closing minutes of the summer transfer window. He signed a three-year contract, with then Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce declaring that he was very pleased with the transfer. Allardyce said in a later interview on the club's website that he felt he acquired Beye for a \"bargain\" price and that him and his international colleague who also signed with him, Abdoulaye Faye would be excellent signings for Newcastle.\n\nHe made his Newcastle debut on 17 September 2007, as a substitute in Newcastle's 1–0 defeat at Derby County. He then made his full debut at home to West Ham United, a display which impressed many Newcastle fans. He had been a fixture in the first team, and scored his only Premier League goal for Newcastle in the 2–1 win against Birmingham City on 8 December, with a near-post header in second-half injury time.\n\nHis ability to defend well and provide a good outlet going forward have enamored him to the Newcastle faithful and a number of terrace songs became established, starting with a chant of his name to the tune of Happy Days first heard at Fulham.\n\nHis status as a cult hero was cemented by the creation of the tongue-in-cheek fan site \"Beyewatch\".\n\nOn 22 May 2008, Beye was named Newcastle player of the season based on fan votes to a poll organised by the Evening Chronicle, he was then named the official Newcastle player of the season on 23 May 2008, as well as being named the Newcastle United Disabled Supporters Association Player of the Season on 22 August.\n\nAfter missing the start of the 2008–09 season from injury, Beye started against Manchester City on 20 October 2008. He was sent off after only 12 minutes for a challenge on Robinho, the first red card of his Newcastle career. Newcastle appealed the red card and on 23 October the claim of wrongful dismissal was upheld. After Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League at the conclusion of the 2008–09 season, an article on the club's official website stated Beye's intention to remain at the club to help get them back into the Premier League.\n\nHowever, the continuing problems behind the scenes at Newcastle would lead to Beye stating that he would have to leave the club in order to save his career.\n\nDespite Hull City chairman Paul Duffen revealing that the \"Tigers\" had agreed a fee with Newcastle United to sign Beye on 6 August 2009, it was announced the following day that Beye had signed for Aston Villa. Beye was substituted late into his Villa debut on the opening day of the 2009–10 season, a 2–0 defeat by Wigan Athletic. He was sent off near the end of his third game for Villa in an away tie against West Ham United. Beye found it hard to break into the Villa first team with the likes of Carlos Cuéllar and Luke Young ahead of him in the pecking order and often found himself restricted to bench appearances. After an extremely disappointing two and a half-year spell at Villa, on 2 February 2012, it was announced that Beye's contract had been cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nAfter making just 9 league appearances for Aston Villa since the summer of 2009 and being surplus to requirements, Beye signed on loan for Doncaster Rovers in November 2011, in a hope to revive his career after a turbulent two years spell in Aston Villa. After his first 3 games for the club, he received big praise from Rovers fans and Rovers manager Dean Saunders following some impressive displays in the centre of defence. He helped Doncaster to two home clean sheets in a row, whilst winning the sponsors man of the match award in both games (against Watford and Southampton) and has been a regular starter in the team. On 22 January 2012, Beye was sent off during a match against Bristol City in a Championship game which ended in a 2–1 defeat, resulting in a three-match ban. This also turned out to be his last game for Doncaster as he was released by Aston Villa on 2 February.\n\nFollowing his release, Beye signed an 18-month deal to permanently join Rovers on 13 February 2012. After completing his domestic three-game ban, he played his first game after signing permanently against Peterborough United in a 1–1 draw on 25 February 2012. He scored his first goal for the club against fellow relegation candidates Portsmouth on 14 April. At the same time, he was sent off for the second time this season for a foul on Portsmouth's Dave Kitson, which conceded a penalty for the opposing side. That result ended 4–3 in favour of Portsmouth and Birmingham City's 2–2 draw against Bristol City confirmed Doncaster's relegation to the League One for the upcoming 2012–13 season. Hhe returned from suspension on 28 April, and scored a late consolation goal for Doncaster Rovers, in a 3–2 defeat by Ipswich Town on the final day of the season. Beye retired from football after his contract ended.\n\nBeye has been a regular in the Senegal national squad since 2001, and has 35 caps and one goal. He made substitute appearances in Senegal's matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, against Denmark, Uruguay and Sweden. He retired from international football in an effort to concentrate on his club career following a shambolic Africa Cup of Nations by Senegal in 2008, though he was then called up for a friendly against Libya on 20 August 2008, meaning that he had either not retired or chosen to come out of it.\n\nBeye is a Muslim.\n\nStrasbourg\n\nMarseille\n\n\nAston Villa\n\n"}
{"id": "1971191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971191", "title": "Scinde Dawk", "text": "Scinde Dawk\n\nScinde Dawk was a very old postal system of runners that served the Indus Valley of Sindh, an area of present-day Pakistan. The term also refers to the first adhesive postage stamps in Asia, the forerunners of the adhesive stamps used throughout India, Burma, the Straits Settlements and other areas controlled by the British East India Company. The name derives from the words “Scinde”, the British spelling of the name of the province of Sindh, and “Dawk”, the anglicised spelling of the Hindustani word “Dak” or Post.\n\nThe Dawk, or Dak, was a very old postal system of runners. The runners were paid according to their distance of travel and the weight of their letters. This was a local Indus Valley system, inefficient and inadequate for the military and commercial needs of the British East India Company after their conquest of Sindh in February, 1843, following the Battle of Miani.\n\nSir Bartle Frere of the East India Company became the Chief Commissioner of Sindh in 1850. Following the English example set by Rowland Hill, Frere improved upon the postal system of Sindh by introducing a cheap and uniform rate for postage, independent of distance travelled. In 1851 the runners were replaced with an efficient system using horses and camels, following routes through Scinde province, generally along the valley of the Indus river. The mail was carried quickly and efficiently, connecting government offices and post offices from Karachi through Kotri and Hyderabad up to Sukkur in the north.\n\nStamps were required for the prepayment of postage, a basic feature of the new system. These stamps, first issued on July 1, 1852, bore the Merchants' Mark of the British East India Company in a design embossed on wafers of red sealing wax impressed on paper. Because they cracked and disintegrated, they were soon replaced by a colourless design embossed on white paper which was hard to see in a dim light. The last stamps were a blue embossing on white paper. All of these had a value of only one-half anna each, but today they rank among the rare classics of philately.\n\nForgeries of these rare stamps are plentiful. The most easily detected fakes are not embossed on paper. Other crude fakes show a misalignment of the second letter 'A' of ANNA with the 'K' of DAWK; and in other fakes the '1/2' is not separated from the central heartshaped emblem.\n\nAfter the Scinde Dawk, Colonel Forbes of the Calcutta Mint came up with an essay for a postage stamp depicting a lion and palm tree. This, and several other essays, were never printed because Forbes could not ensure an adequate supply with the limited machinery at hand. Soon after, new, lithographed stamps printed by the Survey Office appeared in several denominations valid for use throughout British India as part of sweeping postal reforms.\n\nThe British East India Company's posts are important, because the \"Great Company\" held sway over so much of the world's commerce in those days, extending across Asia and East Africa. It had its own armies, coinage, and postal service; constructed railways and public works; and acted like an imperial force long before the Empire was established.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971197", "title": "King of Jazz", "text": "King of Jazz\n\n\"King of Jazz\" was filmed entirely in the early two-color Technicolor process and was produced by Carl Laemmle Jr. for Universal Pictures. The film featured several songs sung on camera by the Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Al Rinker and Harry Barris), as well as off-camera solo vocals by Crosby during the opening credits and, very briefly, during a cartoon sequence. \"King of Jazz\" still survives in a near-complete color print and is not a lost film, unlike many contemporary musicals that now exist only either in incomplete form or as black-and-white reduction copies.\n\nIn 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". \n\n\"King of Jazz\" is a revue. There is zero story, only a series of musical numbers alternating with \"blackouts\" (very brief comedy sketches with abrupt punch line endings) and other short introductory or linking segments.\n\nThe musical numbers are diverse in character, taking a \"something for everyone\" approach to appeal to family audiences by catering to the young, the old and the middle-aged in turn. The slow \"Bridal Veil\" number, featuring (according to Universal) the largest veil ever made, exhibits Victorian sentimentality that might best appeal to the elderly. The middle-aged were courted with a tune by John Boles in a lush setting crooning \"It Happened in Monterey\" in waltz time, or in a barn with a chorus of red-shirted ranch hands belting out the \"Song of the Dawn\". The \"jazzy\" \"Happy Feet\" number was designed to appeal to younger audiences.\n\nOne segment early in the film serves to introduce several of the band's virtuoso musicians (yet those musicians are not credited by name). Another provides the audience with a chance to see the Rhythm Boys, already famous by sound but not sight because of their recordings and radio broadcasts, performing in a home-like setting. There are novelty and comedy numbers ranging from the mildly \"risqué\" (\"Ragamuffin Romeo\", which features contortionistic dancing by Marion Stadler and Don Rose) to the humorously sadomasochistic (the second chorus of \"I Like to Do Things for You\") to the simply silly (\"I'm a Fisherman\"). There is a line of chorus girls, practically mandatory in early musicals, but in their featured spot the novelty is that they are seated.\n\nThe grand finale is the \"Melting Pot of Music\" production number, in which various immigrant groups in national costume offer brief renditions of characteristic songs from their native lands, after which they are all consigned to the American Melting Pot. Performers from some of the earlier musical numbers briefly reprise their acts while reporting for duty as fuel under the pot. Whiteman stirs the steaming stew. When the cooking is complete, everyone emerges transformed into a jazz-happy American.\n\nThere are a couple of early examples of the overhead views later elaborated and made famous by Busby Berkeley, but this film bears little resemblance to his films and other musicals of the later 1930s. It is very much a stage presentation, albeit on a very large stage, and visual interest is maintained only by changes of viewpoint. The cameras do not move. This is not because the Technicolor cameras were heavy and bulky. The cameras used for this early Technicolor process contained a single roll of film and were of nearly ordinary size and weight.\n\n\"King of Jazz\" was the nineteenth all-talking motion picture filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor rather than simply including color sequences. At the time, Technicolor's two-color process employed red and green dyes, each with a dash of other colors mixed in, but no blue dye. \"King of Jazz\" was to showcase a spectacular presentation of George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", so this presented a problem. Fortunately, the green dye Technicolor used can actually appear peacock blue (cyan) under some conditions, but acceptable results in this case would require very careful handling. Art director Herman Rosse and production director John Murray Anderson came up with solutions. Tests were made of various fabrics and pigments, and by using an all gray-and-silver background the bluish aspect of the dye was set off to best advantage. Filters were also used to inject pale blues into the scene being filmed. The goal was to produce a finished film with pastel shades rather than bright colors. Nevertheless, as it appears in an original two-color Technicolor print, the sequence might best be described as a \"Rhapsody in Turquoise\". Later prints made from the original two-component negative, which had survived, make the blues look truer and more saturated than they appeared to audiences in 1930.\n\n\"King of Jazz\" marked the first film appearance of the popular crooner Bing Crosby, who, at the time, was a member of The Rhythm Boys, the Whiteman Orchestra's vocal trio. Crosby was scheduled to sing \"Song of the Dawn\" in the film but a motor accident led to him being jailed for a time and the song was given to John Boles.\n\nComposer Ferde Grofé, best known for his \"Grand Canyon Suite\", was, in these early years, a well known arranger/songwriter for Whiteman. He is documented to have arranged some of the music, and may in fact have composed some of the incidental music.\n\nThe film preserves a vaudeville bit by Whiteman band trombonist Wilbur Hall, who does novelty playing on violin and bicycle pump, as well as the eccentric dancing of \"Rubber Legs\" Al Norman to the tune of \"Happy Feet\".\n\nThere were at least nine different foreign language versions of the film. Reportedly, the Swedish version has at least some different music.\n\nThe film included the first Technicolor animated cartoon segment, by animators Walter Lantz (later famous for Woody Woodpecker and other characters) and William Nolan. In this cartoon, Whiteman is hunting \"in darkest Africa\", where he is chased by a lion which he soothes by playing a tune on a violin (\"Music Hath Charms\", played by Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang). After an elephant squirts water on a monkey in a tree, the monkey throws a coconut at the elephant. It misses and hits Whiteman on the head. The bump on his head forms into a crown. Master of Ceremonies Charles Irwin then remarks, \"And that's how Paul Whiteman was crowned the King of Jazz.\"\n\nOne of the characters making a brief appearance in the cartoon is Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the star of the Universal Studios animation department led by Lantz. A black-and-white sound cartoon featuring Oswald, titled \"My Pal Paul\", also released in 1930 by Universal, promoted \"King of Jazz\" by including songs from the film and a cartoon Paul Whiteman character.\n\nSome of the scenes from the animated cartoon sequence would be later re-used for a later Walter Lantz Oswald Cartoon, \"Africa\".\n\n\"King of Jazz\" was the first feature-length film to use a mostly pre-recorded soundtrack made independently of the actual filming. Whiteman insisted that musical numbers featuring his orchestra should be pre-recorded in order to obtain the best sound, avoiding the poor recording conditions and extraneous noises typical of a movie studio sound stage. Universal opposed the idea, but Whiteman prevailed over the reluctant studio executives. After the sound was recorded, it was played back through a loudspeaker while the scene was being filmed and the performers matched their actions to the recording. Later, the resulting film was synchronized with the soundtrack. This also allowed the scene to be shot in the same manner as a silent film, with the director free to shout out instructions during the filming and the camera unrestricted by any need to silence its noises with bulky soundproofing.\n\nDelbert Cobain, one of the singers in the film, is notable as being the great-uncle of musician Kurt Cobain.\n\nThe Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Harry Barris, and Al Rinker) sang \"Mississippi Mud\", \"So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together\", \"I'm a Fisherman\", \"A Bench in the Park\", and \"Happy Feet\" in the film. This singing trio also recorded as part of Whiteman's band and on their own with Barris on piano. Crosby also sang \"Music Hath Charms\" over the title credits and provided the singing voice for Whiteman in the animated cartoon singing \"My Lord Deliver Daniel\". Bing Crosby went on several benders during the filming, crashed his car on Hollywood Boulevard, sent to jail for 60 days for talking back and wise-cracking to a judge. Whiteman replaced him with John Boles for \"The Song Of The Dawn\".\n\nThe film debuted on April 19, 1930 at the Criterion Theater in Los Angeles. Box-office receipts at this theater were below expectations within the first two weeks.\n\nA grand premiere was held on May 2, 1930 at the Roxy Theater in New York City, where the Whiteman Orchestra, together with George Gershwin and the 125-piece Roxy Symphony Orchestra, put on a stage show. It featured the \"Rhapsody in Blue\" and Mildred Bailey backed by the Roxy Chorus and was performed five times a day, between showings of the film, for a week. The film continued to play at the Roxy for only one additional week.\n\nAs originally released, the film was 105 minutes long. The 1933 reissue was 65 minutes. Several entire sequences and numbers were removed for the reissue, while others were trimmed of just a few shots. One cut for the 1933 re-release was a sketch with William Kent about a suicidal flute player, with the Whiteman Orchestra performing \"Caprice Viennois\" as background music.\n\nThe 2016 restoration runs 98 minutes with two minutes of playout music. Some sections were cut before the film's 1930 release and never seen by the general public. They include:\n\nA 93-minute version, cobbled together from the 65 minute negative and a 16mm print\nwas used for the videocassette release of the film in 1983. Prints of the original uncut version still survive. The Criterion Collection had released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2018. The Blu-ray version has a 4K restoration of the film and includes both the original film and two Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons as well as both 1929 stage version and 1933 short featuring Whiteman and his band.\n\nUniversal expected this revue to repeat or surpass the box-office performance of a musical entitled \"Broadway\" which it had released in 1929. That lavish film had included Technicolor sequences and had been a success. Unfortunately, delays in beginning the filming of \"King of Jazz\" caused its release to occur after two unforeseen developments. First, the public had tired of the flood of movie musicals that began as a slow trickle with \"The Jazz Singer\" in late 1927 and rapidly became a torrent after the success of \"The Broadway Melody\" in early 1929. In particular disfavor were operettas set in bygone eras, musical comedies which were unimaginatively filmed Broadway stage productions, and plotless \"revues\" such as \"King of Jazz\". Second, although the ripple effects from the stock market crash in October 1929 had not yet produced the full-blown depression which would soon be painfully obvious, people were already spending less freely and the effects were starting to be felt at the box office. During its national release, \"King of Jazz\" cleared less than $900,000. Around Hollywood, the movie came to be called \"Universal's Rhapsody in the Red\". Because of poor box-office receipts for the film and the cancellation of his lucrative nationally broadcast radio program by its sponsor in April 1930, Whiteman had to let ten band members go and cut the salaries of the remaining band members by fifteen percent.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. A reviewer for \"The New Movie\" called it a lavish, over-produced \"disappointment\"; an overlong, \"dull mélange\" whose only effective performers were Whiteman and John Boles. In contrast, the \"New York Times\" asserted that \"John Murray Anderson's initial contribution to the audible screen, 'King of Jazz,' with the rotund Paul Whiteman, reveals this director to be a magician of far greater powers than one imagined, even from his stage compositions. This Technicolor potpourri of songs, dancing and fun is a marvel of camera wizardry, joyous color schemes, charming costumes and seductive lighting effects.\" The reviewer, Mordaunt Hall, further praised the film for having \"nothing imitative,\" added that \"Mr. Anderson has visualized the full possibilities of the camera in connection with his flights of fancy,\" and concluded \"there is no sequence that isn't worth witnessing and no performance that is not capable in this fastpaced picture.\"\n\nOverseas, where there was never a backlash against musicals, it fared better and eventually made a profit. During the 1930s, the film found its best audience in Cape Town, South Africa, where it played seventeen return engagements.\n\nThe film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction by Herman Rosse. Other films nominated in this category were \"Bulldog Drummond\", \"The Love Parade\", \"Sally\" and \"The Vagabond King\".\n\nIn 2016 the film was included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry after a significant restoration in 2013.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971206", "title": "Coercion (linguistics)", "text": "Coercion (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, coercion is a term applied to a process of reinterpretation that is triggered by a mismatch between the semantic properties of a selector and the semantic properties of the selected element. The term was first used in the semantic literature by Marc Moens and Mark Steedman, who adopted it on \"loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages\". In the framework of the generative lexicon (a formal compositional approach to lexical semantics), Pustejovsky (1995:111) defines coercion as \"a semantic operation that converts an argument to the type which is expected by a function, where it would otherwise result in a type error.\" \"Coercion\" in the Pustejovsky framework includes complement coercion and aspectual coercion.\n\nAn example of complement coercion is the sentence \"I began the book\", where the predicate \"began\" is assumed to be a selector which requires its complement to denote an event, but \"a book\" denotes an entity, not an event. So, on the coercion analysis, \"begin\" coerces \"a book\" from an entity to an event involving that entity, allowing the sentence to be interpreted to mean, e.g., \"I began to read a book,\" or \"I began to write a book.\" \n\nAn example of aspectual coercion involving temporal connectives is \"Let's leave after dessert\" (Pustejovsky 1995:230). Another example of aspectual coercion from psycholinguistics research includes sentences such as \"The tiger jumped for an hour,\" where the prepositional phrase \"for an hour\" coerces the lexical meaning of \"jump\" to be iterative across the entire duration.\n\nCoercion is closely related to the notions of active zone, construal/conceptualization, and syntactic accommodation known from various schools within the cognitive linguistics movement.\n"}

Sun Bin's Art of War is currently in display at Shandong Provincial museum.\n\nIn the spring of 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the scene of fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops. The civilians were encouraged by army victory in the Battle of Tai'erzhuang, which was nearby, defended Linyi fiercely, but Japanese soldiers breached the walls on April 19, 1938. The defenders withdrew the next day to another contested area 30 miles away.\n\nIn 1946, during the Chinese Civil War, the communist Directorate General of Shandong Wartime Posts was moved from the Yimeng Mountains to Linyi and renamed the Shandong Provincial Postal Administration.\n\nAfter the People's Republic of China was founded in October 1949, the administrative division was adjusted.\n\nIn 2005, Linyi drew international attention as a center of human rights abuses related to the enforcement of China's controversial family planning policies. Following widespread allegations of violence and coercion in excess of Chinese law, local human rights defender Chen Guangcheng filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of the victims. The local Chinese courts refused to hear the case and imprisoned Chen Guangcheng on charges of fomenting state resistance. Due in part to the severity and scope of these abuses Linyi has been used by activists to criticize China's violation of women's rights.\n\nLinyi is in the south of Shandong province, not far from the ports of Rizhao, Lanshan District, Rizhao and Lianyungang.

{"id": "1971256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971256", "title": "Sylvia Scarlett", "text": "Sylvia Scarlett\n\nSylvia Scarlett is a 1935 romantic comedy film starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, based on \"The Early Life and Adventures of Sylvia Scarlett\", a 1918 novel by Compton MacKenzie. Directed by George Cukor, it was notorious as one of the most famous unsuccessful movies of the 1930s. Hepburn plays the title role of Sylvia Scarlett, a female con artist masquerading as a boy to escape the police. The success of the subterfuge is in large part due to the transformation of Hepburn by RKO makeup artist Mel Berns.\n\nThis film was the first pairing of Grant and Hepburn, who later starred together in \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), \"Holiday\" (1938), and \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). Grant's performance as a dashing rogue sees him incorporate a Cockney accent and remains widely considered the first time Grant's famous personality began to register on film. (Grant used the Cockney accent in only a few other films, notably 1939's \"Gunga Din\" and Clifford Odets' \"None but the Lonely Heart\" in 1944.) Cockney was not, however, Cary Grant's original accent. He was born and grew up in Bristol, which has a very different accent from that of London, although it was much closer to Grant's pre-Hollywood accent than the voice he used in most films, a product of his attempting to sound more American in order to broaden the range of roles for which he could be cast.\n\nSylvia Scarlett (Katharine Hepburn) and her father, Henry (Edmund Gwenn), flee France one step ahead of the police. Henry, while employed as a bookkeeper for a lace factory, was discovered to be an embezzler. While on the channel ferry, they meet a \"gentleman adventurer\", Jimmy Monkley (Cary Grant), who partners with them in his con games.\n\nAfter a disastrous test screening, Cukor and Hepburn reportedly begged producer Pandro Berman to shelve the picture if they agreed to make their next film for free. According to RKO records, the film lost a whopping $363,000, and thus began a downturn in Hepburn's career (causing her to be branded \"box office poison\") from which she would eventually recover.\n\nIn a review published two days before his death, Andre Sennwald of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"With what accuracy Compton Mackenzie's novel has been transferred to the screen this deponent knoweth not. But the film has a sprawling, confused and unaccented way of telling its story that might easily be the result of too literal a dramatization of just that sprawling kind of book.\" \"Variety\" said, \"Despite good production values and some strong performances, 'Sylvia Scarlett' is not a reliable candidate for public favor. The story is hard to get. It is puzzling in its tangents and sudden jumps plus the almost poetic lines that are given to Miss Hepburn. At moments the film skirts the border of absurdity and considerable of its mid-section is downright boresome.\" The review added that \"Cary Grant, doing a petty English crook with a Soho accent, practically steals the picture.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" stated, \"The material in the two novels, from which this story was supposedly taken, could have made an outstanding picture. But it was altered radically and was weakened, with the result that it has made an uninteresting comedy. The story is far-fetched and somewhat unpleasant. And the fact that Miss Hepburn goes through most of the picture in male attire may disappoint her followers.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" was positive and found that despite Hepburn's difficult role, the picture was \"charming, sparkling with the feeling that Compton Mackenzie gave his novel of romantic vagrants. Indeed, it is that part of the film with Hepburn in breeches that is best. When at last she puts on skirts and is a girl again, and a girl in love, she is more like most of the movie heroines we have known, and the fantasy fades out in an almost perfunctory happy ending.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" declared, \"A very entertaining film. Parts of the story are a trifle illogical but the direction, acting and some very delightful photography make it seem almost possible.\"\n\nA Turner Classic Movies article suggested that the film's themes of sexual politics were ahead of its time and that the film's reception has improved over the years. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.\n\n\n"}

His father opened a bookstore, attracting a literate clientele that may have influenced Colman's artistic development. He is believed to have studied briefly under the Hudson River School painter Asher Durand, and he exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1850. By 1854 he had opened his own New York City studio. The following year he was elected an associate member of the National Academy, with full membership bestowed in 1862.\n\nHis landscape paintings in the 1850s and 1860s were influenced by the Hudson River School, an example being \"Meadows and Wildflowers at Conway\" (1856) now in the collection of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College. He was also able to paint in a romantic style, which had become more fashionable after the Civil War. One of his best-known works, and one of the iconic images of Hudson River School art, is his \"Storm King on the Hudson\" (1866), now in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. \nColman was an inveterate traveler, and many of his works depict scenes from foreign cities and ports. He made his first trip abroad to France and Spain in 1860–1861, and returned for a more extensive four-year European tour in the early 1870s in which he spent much time in Mediterranean locales. Colman often depicted the architectural features he encountered on his travels: cityscapes, castles, bridges, arches, and aqueducts feature prominently in his paintings of foreign scenes. In 1870 and again in the 1880s he journeyed to the western United States, painting western landscapes comparable in scope and style to those of Thomas Moran.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, watercolor painting became more popular. In 1866, Colman was one of the founders of the American Watercolor Society, and he became its first president from 1867 to 1871. Colman also became skilled at the medium of etching. He was an early member of the New York Etching Club, and published popular etchings depicting European scenes.\n\nColman's artistic activities became even more diverse late in life. By the 1880s he worked extensively as an interior designer, collaborating with his friend Louis Comfort Tiffany on the design of Samuel Clemens' Hartford home, and later on the Fifth Avenue home of Henry and Louisine Havemeyer. He also became a major collector of Asian decorative objects, and wrote two books on geometry and art, one of which was entitled \"Nature's Harmonic Unity\", the other which was entitled \"Proportional Form\".\n\nColman died in New York City in 1920.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971261", "title": "Mount Lofty Ranges", "text": "Mount Lofty Ranges\n\nThe Mount Lofty Ranges are the range of mountains just to the east of Adelaide in the Australian state of South Australia.\n\nThe Mount Lofty Ranges stretch from the southernmost point of the Fleurieu Peninsula at Cape Jervis northwards for over before petering out north of Peterborough. In the vicinity of Adelaide, they separate the Adelaide Plains from the extensive plains that surround the Murray River and stretch eastwards to Victoria.\n\nThe Heysen Trail traverses almost the entire length of the ranges, crossing westwards to the Flinders Ranges near Hallett.\n\nThe mountains have a Mediterranean climate with moderate rainfall brought by south-westerly winds, hot summers and cool winters. The southern ranges are wetter (with of rain per year) than the northern ranges ().\n\nThe part of the ranges south of and including the Barossa Valley are commonly known as the South Mount Lofty Ranges, and the highest part of this section is the summit of Mount Lofty (). The part of the ranges nearest Adelaide is called the Adelaide Hills and, further north, the Barossa Range.\n\nThe ranges encompass a wide variety of land usage, including significant residential development, particularly concentrated in the foothills, suburbs of Stirling and Bridgewater, and the towns Mount Barker and Victor Harbor in particular. Several pine plantation forests exist, most significantly around Mount Crawford and Cudlee Creek in the north and Kuitpo Forest and Second Valley in the south. Several protected areas exist near Adelaide where the hills face the city in order to preserve highly sought-after residential land: Black Hill Conservation Park, Cleland Conservation Park and Belair National Park are the largest. The other significant parks in the southern ranges are Deep Creek Conservation Park, on the rugged southern shores of the Fleurieu Peninsula, and Para Wirra Conservation Park at the southern edge of the Barossa Valley.\n\nThere are many wineries in the ranges. Two wine regions in particular are world-renowned: the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. Grapes are also grown in the Adelaide Hills and the Onkaparinga Valley.\n\nAlthough no major mines operate in the southern ranges today, there are several large disused ones, and a myriad of small ones. An iron sulfide mine at Brukunga, northeast of Mount Barker, operated from 1955 to 1972, proving a valuable source for the production of superphosphate fertilisers vital for the postwar development of the State's outlying agricultural areas. The runoff from the mine unfortunately proved quite toxic for the local environment, and efforts have been underway since to alleviate the damage.\n\nA small short-lived silver and lead mine in the foothills of the ranges at Glen Osmond was first opened just two years after the founding of the State in 1836: it is significant for being not only the first metal mine in the history of the State, but the first in all Australia. South Australia never experienced a nineteenth-century gold rush like those interstate, but gold was mined near both Echunga and Williamstown (in the Barossa). Other mines in the southern ranges include a nineteenth-century silver-lead mine at Talisker near Cape Jervis, which features many remaining old buildings, and the limestone mine at Rapid Bay, which ceased operations much more recently. Copper was mined at Kapunda, Truro and Kanmantoo and may be again and a zinc (and lead, silver and gold) mine is proposed near Strathalbyn. Quarries dot the ranges, the most spectacular and massive of which are in the Adelaide foothills; they supplied much of the quartzite which is to be seen in the enduring \"sandstone architecture\" of early Adelaide.\n\nOnly one railway now crosses the ranges: the major Adelaide-Melbourne line, which was first constructed in the 1870s and has had only minor realignments since (the most significant of which was the boring of a new tunnel at Sleeps Hill). Passenger services used to run from the city to Bridgewater in the heart of the hills and ranges, but now stop at Belair in the foothills. A railway approaches the ranges at Willunga (although it was discontinued in the 1960s and has since been replaced by a cycling trail). The Mount Barker to Victor Harbor line (now used only for recreational purposes) largely skirts the eastern edge of the ranges. North of Adelaide, there is a railway to Angaston in the east of the Barossa Valley, and former railways to Truro and across the ranges near Eudunda to Morgan on the Murray River.\n\nThe ranges form part of the water supply for Adelaide, and there is an extensive infrastructure of reservoirs, weirs, and pipelines, on the Torrens, Onkaparinga, Little Para and Gawler River catchments. Mount Bold, South Para, Kangaroo Creek, and Millbrook reservoirs are the largest.\n\nThe northern ranges, often confused with the southern Flinders Ranges, and sometimes referred to as the \"Mid-North ranges\" or \"central hill country\", stretch from hills near Kapunda in the south to arid ranges beyond Peterborough in the northeast. The highest peak in this section (and in all the Mount Lofty Ranges - despite the name) is Mount Bryan (). Other significant peaks include New Campbell Hill () and Stein Hill (), which overlooks Burra.\n\nThe northern ranges include Belvidere Range, Tothill Range and the Skilly Hills.\n\nMining, although totally absent today, was once a major industry in the northern ranges. The copper mine at Kapunda, just north of the Barossa, operated from 1842 to 1877 and was a major boost to the infant State's economy, but was soon overshadowed by the large workings at Burra, further north. The mine here operated from 1845 to 1877 with a few minor interruptions, and was superseded by even larger workings on the Yorke Peninsula. As testament to the volume of copper at Burra, however, the mine re-opened as an open-cut in 1971, before closing again ten years later.\n\nThe Clare Valley lies in a shallow fold of the northern Mount Lofty Ranges just southwest of Burra. It is yet another world-class wine-producing area, and is a very popular weekend tourist destination for people living in Adelaide. It is also home to the only conservation park in the northern ranges, Spring Gully.\n\nThe northern end of the ranges are home to two curiosities: a tiny township by the name of Yongala, familiar to South Australians for commonly being the coldest place in the state (being a hundred kilometres inland, and on a somewhat elevated plateau as with much of the Mid North). The other curiosity is a locality near Orroroo called \"Magnetic Hill\". The name stems from a reputation that if you take your car there, it will roll uphill.\n\nThe ranges are part of the Adelaide Rift Complex. The southern ranges and slopes of Mount Lofty overlooking the Adelaide Plains have been block-faulted to form a half-graben structure. The ranges when viewed from the beach or city have a \"stepped\" appearance, reflected in an early name for the ranges, \"The Tiers\".\n\nThere are several major normal faults in the Adelaide region, trending northeast to southwest defining these blocks:\n\n\nAll the fault zones are still active today, along with the rest of the ranges, and minor earthquakes are relatively common. Larger quakes in the southern ranges are fairly rare: the last to hit a major centre was the 1954 Adelaide earthquake that occurred on 1 March. It measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.\n\nA significant aspect of the geology of the Adelaide area is a number of Tertiary marine sands deposits, many of which have been extensively quarried. One of these deposits is around the outer-northern suburb of Golden Grove; another area is around McLaren Vale.\n\nThe natural habitat of the mountainsides is woodland of eucalyptus trees mixed with golden wattle acacia trees on the lower slopes, all with an undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. The flowers include a number of endemic orchids. Similar habitats can be found on the offshore Kangaroo Island which is included by the World Wildlife Fund in the Mount Lofty woodlands ecoregion. The western half of Kangaroo Island has more open woodland containing sugar gum (\"Eucalyptus cladocalyx\") and drooping sheoak (\"Allocasuarina verticillata\") and more endemic plant species in general than are found on the mainland.\n\nThe mountains are home to a number of marsupials such as the koala, western gray kangaroo, southern brown bandicoot and the tammar wallaby on Kangaroo Island and a monotreme (egg-laying mammal), the echidna (while the platypus remains on Kangaroo Island only). Birds include the southern emu-wren which is endemic to the Fleurieu Peninsula. There are a number of reptiles including the endangered Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink.\n\nThe hillsides have largely been cleared of woodland for fruit growing and other agriculture and the urban growth of Adelaide particularly on the lower slopes, leading to loss of habitat and local extinction of wildlife species including all species of bettong and quoll marsupials and birds including regent honeyeater (\"Xanthomyza phrygia\"), swift parrot (\"Lathamus discolor\"), king quail (\"Coturnix chinensis\"), brown quail (\"C. ypsilophora\"), and azure kingfisher (\"Alcedo azurea\"). Clearance and agriculture are ongoing and livestock grazing continues to cause damage to habitats while introduced cats, foxes and rabbits are a threat to habitats and wildlife. Protected areas tend to be small and fragmented. Kangaroo Island has been less affected and also does not have rabbits or foxes, although koalas have been introduced from the Australian mainland and are causing damage to habitats.\n\n\n"}

Pissouri’s administrative area is the third biggest in Limassol District. The main settlement of Pissouri is situated about three kilometres away from the bay named Cape Aspro, and is built on the side of a green hill. The settlement is placed in the middle of Pissouri’s territory.\n\nNow they are two distinct communities, Pissouri Village Area and Pissouri Bay Area. The total permanent population is said to reach around 1100 people, about half of whom are Cypriots, the rest foreigners, mainly British, residents and visitors.\n\nThere are several shops, and many tavernas, restaurants and bars in the village. There is also a Bank of Cyprus branch in the village's central square.\n\nAccording to some official sources, the name \"Pissouri\" derives from the ancient city ‘Voousoura’, as reported by Stravonas, a 1st-century BCE - 1st-century CE philosopher, mathematician and geographer. Some other sources connect the name of the village with pitched-dark nights.\n\nA legend reports that the 300 Alamanoi (German) saints who came to Cyprus from Palestine in order to practice in various parts of the island, arrived on the Pissouri’s coast during such a pitch-dark night. Another legend reports that ‘the Saint Fathers’ pursued during the post-Christian era, were met in Pissouri’s region during a really black-night. However, it seems that the name of the village does not eventually stem from those legendaries but from the fact that in the region there was an extensive extraction of skin-sap from pine trees (called ‘pissa’ in Greek). The skin-sap production begun during the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), continued during the Middle-Ages (5th – 15th century) and the Frankish era in Cyprus.\n\nPissouri has an annual rainfall in the order of 447 millimetres. Local products nowadays are tabled grapes, wine, potatoes and other citrus fruits in smaller quantities planted across the valley spanning from the gulf to the hill, where the settlement is. There are also many olive, carob and almond trees. Unfortunately, during the last years, farmers had to eradicate big part of their vineyards, as they became profitless.\nDuring the last decade, and in particular the last 6 years, the residents have shifted to alternative financial resources with a better interest profit. Most of them have extensively dealt with buildings' construction and specifically with the erection of numerous residential places and new neighbourhoods. It is a matter of time before the village becomes literally autonomous in terms of services and facilities found locally. Pissouri seems to evolve rapidly, following the trends of the globalisation and global investments'.\n\nThe Church of Apostle Andrea was built with voluntary work by the good-willing residents of the community in 1883. The work for the construction of the church lasted for about twelve years.\nThe Stone that the church is built originates from the regions of villages Anogyra and Prasteio villages and was transferred in the village with carts which were dragged by Cypriot donkeys.\nThe church is built in Gothic style.\nThe place that it is built was used as the village cemetery up to 1912.\n\nThe church is famous for its wooden-carved Icon Stand, which is a real work of art and was manufactured in 1890. The manufacture lasted 10 entire years because of the means of that time.\n\nOther chapels are: Saint George, Prophet Elias, Saint Alexandros, Saint Mauritius, Saint Spyridonas.\n\n"}

{"id": "1971305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971305", "title": "Hot desking", "text": "Hot desking\n\nHot desking (sometimes called \"non-reservation-based hoteling\") is an office organization system which involves multiple workers using a single physical work station or surface during different time periods. The \"desk\" in the name refers to an office desk being shared by multiple office workers on different shifts as opposed to each staff member having their own personal desk. A primary motivation for hot desking is cost reduction through space savings—up to 30% in some cases. Hot desking is especially valuable in cities where real estate prices are high. Research has demonstrated that while there may be cost savings in office space hot desking has significant negative impacts on both productivity and staff morale.\n\nHot desking is often found in workplaces with flexible schedules for employees, where not all employees are actually working in an office at the same time or on the same schedules. Employees in such workplaces use existing offices only occasionally or for short periods of time, which leaves offices vacant. By sharing such offices, employees make more efficient use of company space and resources. However, hot desking does come with disadvantages—these include a lack of permanent space, an unclear work hierarchy, and possibly inconvenient communication between members of a team.\n\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages to hot desking. From the standpoint of the employee, it might be hard to get used to it, as many different people have different styles of using a desk (adjusting the chair to different heights, moving around decorations, keeping it tidy). However, it is seen that hot desking can increase productivity and communication in a business. \n\nAn alternative version of hot desking would be in a workplace where employees have multiple tasks and multiple employees may require a certain work station, but not for their entire duties. Thus a permanent work station can be made available to any worker as and when needed, with employees sharing the station as needed. This could be for a single element of one’s work, for example, when a sales employee needs an office for a client meeting but does not otherwise have need of a personal office. Another example would be when employees need to perform specific tasks at work stations created for those tasks in an assembly line fashion. There, the individual work stations are not set up as personal offices. A collection of such workstations is sometimes called a mobility centre.\n\nWith the growth of mobility services, hot desking can also include the routing of voice and other messaging services to any location where the user is able to log into their secure corporate network. Therefore, their telephone number, their email, and instant messaging can be routed to their location on the network and no longer to just their physical desk.\n\nThe term \"hot desking\" is thought to derive from the naval practice of \"hot racking\", where sailors on different shifts share the same bunks.\n\nWith the emergence of hot desking and the increasing presence of technology in the workplace, tools have been developed to make it easier to utilize hot desking in an office environment, to standardize the process, and to automatically enforce basic business rules or policies. Generally, using the hot desking method is accomplished by installing and operating by a piece of software which integrates with the company's email and calendaring systems, with the telephony or PBX systems, and is tailored to the office of each individual company. These software systems usually also allow the company to manage many space-related resources such as conference rooms, desks, offices, and project rooms. Sophisticated software systems for managing these space resources often also manage the support equipment and services such as audio-visual equipment and catering for meeting rooms, lockers and carts for desks and offices, and parking spaces for the people actually using those space resources on the same day.\n\nIn some cases, the employees are designated to a certain area but because of the hot desking situation, all available seats must look the same. Therefore, in order to enable workers to make sure they are sitting in the right group area (or \"neighborhood\"), sometimes colored walls, mousepads, static printed, or dynamic digital nameplates are used. Workers are then designated to sit anywhere in a given group area. For example, if groups are associated with specific group colors, individual group members might be directed to the red zone, or maybe the blue zone, depending on group.\n"}
{"id": "1971307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971307", "title": "To Have and Have Not (film)", "text": "To Have and Have Not (film)\n\nTo Have and Have Not is a 1944 American romance-war-adventure film directed by Howard Hawks, loosely based on Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel of the same name. It stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan and Lauren Bacall; it also features Dolores Moran, Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard, Dan Seymour, and Marcel Dalio. The plot centers on the romance between a freelancing fisherman in Martinique and a beautiful American drifter, which is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France.\n\nErnest Hemingway and Howard Hawks were close friends and, on a fishing trip, Hawks told Hemingway, who was reluctant to go into screenwriting, that Hemingway could make a great movie from his worst book, which Hawks admitted was \"To Have and Have Not\". Jules Furthman wrote the first screenplay, which was set in Cuba like the novel. However, the screenplay was altered to be set in Martinique instead of Cuba because the portrayal of Cuba's government was believed to be in violation of the United States' Good Neighbor policy with Latin American countries. Hawks's other good friend, William Faulkner, was the main contributor to the screenplay, including and following the revisions. Because of the contributions from both Hemingway and Faulkner, the film represents the only film story on which two winners of the Nobel Prize of Literature worked. Filming began on February 29, 1944, while Faulkner continued to work on the script, and ended on May 10.\n\nThe film released nationally on October 11, 1944. Audience reception of the film was generally good. Reviews were mixed, with many claiming that the film was a remake of \"Casablanca\" (1942). Critics specifically mentioned Lauren Bacall's performance or the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall on screen. Bogart and Bacall began an off-screen relationship during production and married in 1945, after the film's release. \"To Have and Have Not\" was one of the top thirty grossing films in 1944 and it received an award from the National Board of Review.\n\nIn the summer of 1940, world-weary Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) operates a small fishing-boat, the \"Queen Conch\", in Fort-de-France, on the French colony of Martinique. It is not long since the fall of France and the island is controlled by pro-German Vichy France. Harry makes a modest living chartering his fishing boat to tourists, along with his unofficial mate Eddie (Walter Brennan). Eddie is Harry's close friend and one time trusted co-worker, but he has become a loud-mouthed drunk. The island is a tinder-box of dissent, harboring many people sympathetic to Free France.\n\nAt his hotel home, hotel owner Gérard (Marcel Dalio) (known as \"Frenchy\" to English speakers) urges Harry to help the French Resistance by smuggling some people onto the island. Harry steadfastly refuses, choosing to keep aloof from the current political situation. Also at the hotel, he meets Marie (\"Slim\") Browning (Lauren Bacall), a young American wanderer who has recently arrived in Martinique. An accomplished singer, she sings \"How Little We Know\" with pianist Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) in the hotel bar.\n\nHarry's current charter client, Johnson (Walter Sande), owes Harry $825. Johnson insists he hasn't enough ready money, but promises to get the funds when the banks open the next day. In the hotel bar, Harry notices Slim pick Johnson's pocket and he later forces her to hand over the wallet. On inspection the wallet is found to contain $1,400 in traveler's cheques and a plane ticket for early the next morning (before the banks are open). On returning the wallet to Johnson, Harry demands that Johnson sign the traveler's cheques to pay him immediately. But just then, there is a shootout in front of the hotel between police and the Resistance, and Johnson is killed by a stray bullet. The police take Harry and several others for questioning, and seize Harry's passport and money.\n\nBack at the hotel, Gérard offers to hire Harry and his boat for one night to transport Resistance members Paul de Bursac (Walter Surovy) and his wife Hélène (Dolores Moran). Now effectively penniless, Harry reluctantly accepts Gérard's offer. Meanwhile, a romance has been developing between Harry and Slim, the latter of whom feels that Harry changed his mind about the smuggling to help her out. Her suspicions are bolstered by the fact that Harry has used some of the money he earned in transporting the fugitives to buy her a plane ticket back to America.\n\nHarry picks up the de Bursacs, but his boat is seen and fired upon by a navy patrol boat. His passenger Paul de Bursac is wounded, but Harry manages to escape by turning the \"Queen Conch\" into a fogbank. On returning to the hotel, he learns Slim has not used the ticket he purchased for her and instead has stayed in Martinique to be with him. The de Bursacs are hiding in the basement of the hotel and at Frenchy's request, Harry removes the bullet from Paul's shoulder. He learns the couple have come to Martinique to help a man with the Free French escape from the penal colony at Devil's Island. De Bursac asks for Harry's assistance in this operation, but Harry respectfully turns him down.\n\nThe police return to the hotel and reveal that they recognized Harry's boat the previous night. They also reveal that they have Eddie in custody. Exploiting his problems with alcohol, they plan to withhold liquor until he reveals the details of the smuggling plot. His friend in custody and his back against the wall, Harry decides to act. With Slim's help, Harry gains access to a gun in his desk, and turns the tables on the police, killing one of them in the process. He holds Vichyite Police Captain Renard (Dan Seymour) at gunpoint and forces him to order Eddie's release and sign harbor passes. When Eddie returns, Harry, Slim and the de Bursacs escape on the \"Queen Conch\", Harry having agreed to help the de Bursacs with their mission.\n\n\nOn a ten-day fishing trip, independent director Howard Hawks tried to convince Ernest Hemingway to write him a script, but Hemingway was not interested in working in Hollywood. Hawks insisted he could make a film from his \"worst story\". Although Hawks had a high regard for Hemingway's works in general, he considered \"To Have and Have Not\" to be his worst book, a \"bunch of junk\", and told Hemingway so. Hemingway and Hawks worked on the screenplay during the remainder of the fishing trip. Hemingway and Hawks had discussed that the film was not going to resemble the novel, and would rather tell the story of how Morgan met Marie. Marie's character was extensively altered for the film.\n\nIn May 1939, Hemingway sold book rights to Howard Hughes. Hughes sold the book rights to Hawks in October 1943, who then sold them to Warner Bros.. Because the rights to the novel bounced between sellers, Hawks made ten times more money selling the rights of the novel than Hemingway did. Hemingway reportedly refused to speak to Hawks for \"three months\" upon finding this out. The screenplay for \"To Have and Have Not\" bears little resemblance to Hemingway's novel of the same name. The only similarities include the title, the name and a few personality traits of the main character Harry Morgan, the name of Marie, the name of Eddie, and the name and character traits of Johnson. Johnson is the only character that remained the same in the novel, in every revised screenplay, and in the film. The film only bears resemblance to the first four chapters of the novel.\n\nHoward Hawks recruited Jules Furthman to work on the screenplay. Completed on October 12, 1943, the initial screenplay was 207 pages. It resembled the novel more than the final screenplay did. By the end of December, Furthman had completed a revised screenplay with sixty fewer pages. Hawks instructed Furthman, to alter Marie's character to be more sultry and masculine like Marlene Dietrich. In the previous version of the script, Bacall's purse was stolen; after the revision, Bacall's character stole the purse. Much of Bacall's character was based on Hawks's wife Slim Keith. Some of her lines reportedly came directly from Keith. According to Keith, Furthman even suggested she ask for script credit. Hawks instructed Furthman to work on the final screenplay and stop writing the second version of the screenplay. The second version had Bacall as a minor character in case she proved to be poor for the role. Furthman worked on the screenplay throughout January and February 1944 and recruited Cleve F. Adams and Whitman Chambers to help him with the work. He completed it before February 14, 1944.\n\nJoseph Breen read the script and cited three dozen instances which violated the Production Code, citing that Morgan was portrayed as an unpunished murderer and the women as suggested prostitutes. He stated that the characters must be softened, the studio must remove all suggestions of inappropriate sexual relations between men and women, and that murder must be made clear to appear as self-defense. As the movie was filmed during World War II, Hawks moved the setting from Cuba to Vichy-controlled Martinique as required by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to placate the Roosevelt administration. They objected to the unfavorable portrayal of Cuba's government as against the U.S. government's \"Good Neighbor\" policy toward Latin American nations. Writer William Faulkner was hired on by Hawks on February 22, 1944, to avoid recounting political conflict between Free France and the Vichy government in the story line and to satisfy the Production Code. It was reportedly Faulkner's idea to change the setting of the film to Martinique, because he had been working on an unproduced story line involving Charles de Gaulle, so he was familiar with the details. Furthman stopped writing after Faulkner was brought on the project.\n\nFaulkner and Hemingway never met, but \"To Have and Have Not\" is considered by Charles M. Oliver the best adaptation for film of Hemingway's novels. In order to satisfy the Production Code, Faulkner wrote that every character would sleep in the same hotel, but put Morgan and Marie's bedrooms across from each other to facilitate interactions between them as well as reducing Marie's drinking in the film. He also removed scenes in which Morgan appeared to be a murderer. Other additions included Marie becoming Morgan's sole romantic interest and Helen and her husband becoming fighters for the resistance. Finally, Faulkner made the time frame for the film three days instead of the many months depicted in the novel. Hawks intended to have the screenplay be loosely modeled on \"Casablanca\", which also starred Humphrey Bogart, hoping for the same success \"Casablanca\" had met at the box office.\n\nProduction began on February 29, 1944, with only thirty-six pages of the screenplay written, due to changes required by the Production Code office. Faulkner had very little time in between the rebuilding of sets to continue the screenplay, therefore, each scene was written three days before it was filmed. The final cast reading was done on March 6, 1944 with final script changes finished by April 22. Line by line, Hawks and Bogart changed the script to create a more sexual and comedic film. For example, the line \"It's even better when you help\", was not originally in the script and was added during filming. After 62 days, filming was completed May 10, 1944. Bogart and Hawks served as their own technical advisers, because of their experience with fishing and sailing.\n\nAfter filming began, a romance developed between Bogart and Bacall, despite Hawks's disapproval. Bogart was married and at 45 years old, he was more than twice Bacall's age. They kept their relationship a secret from Hawks. This romance eventually led to Bogart divorcing Mayo Methot, his third wife. He and Bacall married a year after \"To Have and Have Not\" and remained married until Bogart's death in 1957. Hawks expanded Bacall's part to take advantage of the Bogart-Bacall chemistry. According to the documentary, \"A Love Story: The Story of \"To Have and Have Not\"\", included on the 2003 DVD release, Hawks recognized the star-making potential of the film for Bacall. He emphasized her role and downplayed Dolores Moran's role, the film's other female lead. (Hawks and Moran had their own affair during production). Two weeks before the end of production, Bacall was called to Hawks's home. Hawks told her Bogart did not love her and she was in danger of losing career opportunities. After he threatened to send her to B-list Monogram Pictures, Bacall was very upset. She told Bogart and he became upset with Hawks. This caused an argument between Hawks and Bogart, stunting production for two weeks. Bogart recognized his power and used negotiation to his advantage. After negotiating with Warner, Bogart received an extra $33,000 salary, as long as Bogart promised to no longer stall production.\n\nIn her autobiography, Lauren Bacall described what she called Hawks's \"brilliantly creative work method\" on set. She described that every morning on set, Hawks would sit with Bacall, Bogart, and whoever else was in the scene in chairs in a circle as a script girl read the scene. After reading through the scene, Hawks would add sexual dialogue and innuendo between Bacall and Bogart. After Hawks and Bogart felt the changes were adequate, Hawks would add one light on the set and they would go through the scene. Hawks would encourage them to move freely and do what felt comfortable for them. After going through the scenes a few times, cinematographer Sidney Hickox would discuss camera set ups with Hawks.\n\nAccording to biographer Todd McCarthy, \"To Have and Have Not\" is a quintessential Hawks film. It contains classic Hawksian characters such as the strong male and his female counterpart. He also states that although elements of Hemingway, Faulkner, and \"Casablanca\" can be found in the film, it represents Hawks's capacity for expression, claiming it is, \"beyond doubt, exactly the work its director intended it to be, and would have been nothing like this in the hands of anyone else.\"\n\nCricket, the piano player in the hotel bar, was played by the singer-songwriter Hoagy Carmichael. In the course of the movie, Cricket and Slim perform \"How Little We Know\", by Carmichael and Johnny Mercer, and \"Am I Blue?\", by Harry Akst and Grant Clarke. Cricket and the band also perform \"Hong Kong Blues\", by Carmichael and Stanley Adams. \"The Rhumba Jumps\", by Mercer and Carmichael, is performed by the hotel band. Bacall shimmies out at the end of the movie to a faster \"How Little We Know\". The song \"Baltimore Oriole\" was intended to be Bacall's theme for the movie, but was merely added as background music on the soundtrack due to Bacall's vocal inexperience. Background music or nondiegetic music is minimal in the picture. However, the film score including the main title was composed by Franz Waxman. According to professor of film studies Ian Brookes, Howard Hawks uses jazz, particularly through interracial performance scenes, to underscore anti fascism in the story line of the film.\n\nA persistent myth is that a teenage Andy Williams, the future singing star, dubbed the singing for Bacall. According to authoritative sources, including Hawks and Bacall, this was not true. Williams and some female singers were tested to dub for Bacall because of fears she lacked the necessary vocal skills. But those fears were overshadowed by the desire to have Bacall do her own singing (perhaps championed by Bogart) despite her less than perfect vocal talent.\nThis myth is disputed in \"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" entry for this film, but the myth is propagated in a 1986 episode of \"MacGyver\", entitled \"Three for the Road\", when the character of a movie veteran asks his wife this particular question, whereupon she answers that Andy Williams, when 14, did dub the voice for Lauren Bacall. Several sources on the film set have stated this myth is false. In fact, Bacall's low singing voice in the film helps her character establish a form of masculine dominance.\n\nIn one scene, Marie says to Morgan, \"I'm hard to get, Steve. All you have to do is ask me.\" This quote came from the earlier 1939 Hawks film \"Only Angels Have Wings\" in which Jean Arthur says to Cary Grant, \"I'm hard to get, Geoff. All you have to do is ask me.\"\n\nWarner Bros. released \"To Have and Have Not\" in October 11, 1944.\n\nThe critical reception of \"To Have and Have Not\" at the time of release was mixed yet often unflattering. Firstly, early publicity and much of the initial reaction to the film centered around Lauren Bacall, either praising her or criticizing her part in the film as merely as a gimmick for attention from the press. Other critics found the film to be betraying Hemingway's work due to only the first fifteen minutes of the film bearing resemblance to his novel. Finally, Americans were preoccupied with World War II and had little interest in a hero (Bogart) who consistently rejected commitment and whose only interest in France's cause was financial, to help himself and his girl (Bacall). Critics called the film a fast, witty romance with a plot as merely \"an excuse for some good scenes.\" \"Variety\" cited the film's inferiority to \"Casablanca\" and other Warner Bros. melodramas, but acknowledged the film's success in its characterization. \"Time\" called the film a \"tinny romantic melodrama which millions of cinemaddicts have been waiting for ever since \"Casablanca\".\" \"New York Variety\" was mixed about the film citing, \"nifty productional accoutrements\" with \"too unsteady\" a story line. Other reviewers called it, \"definitely swell entertainment\", while others stated it was an delightful remake of \"Casablanca\". American film critic James Agee liked the film but felt \"Going My Way\" was better, because \"To Have and Have Not\" focused too much on \"character and atmosphere\" rather than on plot. Agee was far more interested in Bacall's performance than the anti-Fascist themes in the film.\n\nThe film was one of the top thirty grossing pictures of 1944. According to Warner Bros records the film earned $3,652,000 domestically and $1,605,000 foreign, coming close to the high earnings of \"Casablanca\".\n\nAggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 97% approval of \"To Have or Have Not\", with the critical consensus stated as, \"With Howard Hawks directing and Bogey and Bacall in front of the cameras, \"To Have and Have Not\" benefits from several levels of fine-tuned chemistry -- all of which ignite on screen.\"\n\nScreenwriter and film critic Paul Schrader classified the film as noir, made during the first or \"wartime\" period of film noir. Some other scholars categorize the film as noir, while some don't believe Howard Hawks ever made a true \"noir\". The names of the characters in \"To Have and Have Not\" are directly related to the quality of the characters. Characters which are meant to elicit sympathy from the viewer are known by their nicknames: Steve, Slim, Eddie, Frenchy, and Cricket. In this way, Hawks creates the illusion of a character by devoiding it of past and present social roles that may be associated with a surname. Villains or corrupted characters are called by their surnames such as Johnson.\n\nAccording to English film critic Robin Wood, \"To Have and Have Not\" presents \"one of the most basic anti-fascist statements the cinema has given us.\" The film portrays anti-fascist themes common to the time period through its emphasis on individual liberty expressed through Bogart's character and through its representation of people progressing and working together well. When he decides to join the resistance cause, Morgan reasons, \"maybe because I like you and maybe because I don't like them.\" The power of this anti-fascist statement comes because it's instinctive rather than coming from an expected ideology. More generally, Hawks expresses a protest of authoritarianism and infringement of individual rights. Hawks, however, claimed he wasn't interested in politics and the focus of the movie was on the relationship between Bogart and Bacall. Regardless, the anti-fascist themes come through in the relationship between Bogart and Bacall. They represent the individual standing up to those who abuse their power. According to Ian Brookes, during the scene where Bacall sings \"Am I Blue?\" with Hoagy Carmichael, her low-voice establishes herself as \"one of the boys\" and thus a \"soldier\" in the anti-fascist cause. Moreover, during this scene, the patrons at the bar represent different races and are racially integrated throughout the space, challenging the ideas of segregation and race during the time period. The next song, \"Limehouse Blues\" is reminiscent of Django Reinhardt's pre-war version. This represents French resistance spirit, as swing music became a symbol of resistance in France, because it was the only available example of American culture in France at the time.\n\nA common theme of war films such as \"To Have and Have Not\" is the conversion narrative. An individual who originally does not want to be involved in the war effort eventually becomes converted through a changed attitude and accepts their duty as a citizen to participate in the war efforts. Along with Harry Morgan's transformation, the Humphrey Bogart persona changed along the years, making him an important casting decision for the film. Harry Morgan, the fisherman, represents the center of the story line of \"To Have and Have Not\". According to Robin Wood, Harry Morgan represents, at the same time, the personality of Humphrey Bogart and the Hawksian hero. Harry Morgan, as a character, represents a myth the audience accepts as real such as the heroes of Homer. Morgan represents the heroic ideal. Morgan acts on his own interests, yet is not self-indulgent, minding his \"own business\". He does good, because of the responsibility he feels he has for his personal alliances. Morgan controls and establishes the morality of the film through the distinctness of what one does and what one is. Bogart's character establishes: one's personal identity is not determined by one's actions if they do not allow it to happen. In the film, Slim steals Johnson's wallet. Harry overlooks this to a point because he (Johnson) did not pay Morgan for his services as a boat captain. When they are both approached by Morgan, Slim shows no shame, indicating her morality was not affected by her actions. Johnson, however, shows shame and doesn't receive sympathy, because he reveals he is defined by his actions. Bogart's character is direct and blunt, yet makes an effort to not judge a person by their actions. Harry Morgan encompasses the qualities of the \"Hawksian\" hero due to his personal integrity, and at the same time could be described as a Hemingway code hero because of his courage and loyalty.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the film and the novel is the resolution of Harry Morgan. In the novel, Morgan is beaten down through the story line and perishes in the end. In the film, however, Morgan ends up a winner. This was specifically altered by Hawks because he did not like stories about \"losers\".\n\nWith some regarding \"To Have and Have Not\" as one of Hawks's best, the film represents the only time two Nobel Prize winners, Faulkner and Hemingway, worked on the same film story. Some of Bacall's lines became renowned as \"double entendre\"; for instance, \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and ... blow ...\" (said while looking at him provocatively). This quote is ranked at #34 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.\nWhen Humphrey Bogart was buried, Bacall put a gold whistle with the inscription \"If you want anything, just whistle\" in his coffin, a nod to her line in their first film together.\n\n\"To Have and Have Not\" is noted for its similarity to earlier films \"Casablanca\" (1942) and \"Morocco\" (1930) and \"Across the Pacific\" (1942). There are some similarities to the plot of the earlier \"Casablanca\", and both stories involve the French Resistance. Other changes from Hemingway tended in the same direction, such as the introduction of a sympathetic piano player as an important supporting character. Carmichael's Cricket was not in the Hemingway book, and parallels Dooley Wilson's Sam in \"Casablanca\". Several cast members from \"Casablanca\" also appear in the film; apart from Bogart and Dalio (Emil in \"Casablanca\"), Dan Seymour (Abdul in \"Casablanca\") plays Captain Renard, whose name and position resemble Captain Renault in \"Casablanca\". As in \"Casablanca\", Bogart's initially reluctant character assists husband-and-wife Resistance members.\n\n\"To Have and Have Not\" was adapted as an hour-long radio play for \"Lux Radio Theater\", with Bogart and Bacall reprising their screen roles. It was broadcast on October 14, 1946.\n\nWarner Brothers adapted the novel a second time with the film \"The Breaking Point\" (1950) directed by Michael Curtiz, who was also so credited for \"Casablanca\". This screenplay stayed closer to the novel; it bore little resemblance to the 1944 film. Screenwriter Ranald MacDougall and Curtiz were interested in creating a film better modeled after Hemingway's novel. The film did not remotely resemble \"Casablanca\". Despite the film's faithfulness to the novel, it remains less popular than \"To Have and Have Not\", though Hemingway said the remake, \"suited him\". The film was remade another time in 1958 by director Don Siegel. Siegel was reluctant to remake the film, but \"needed the money\". The film was shot quickly and cheaply. According to author Gene D. Phillips, the film was nothing more than a \"crass exploitation of the Hemingway book\".\n\nFrom 1951 to 1952, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall participated in a weekly, half-hour radio adventure series called \"Bold Venture\", intended to be a spin-off of \"To Have and Have Not\".\n\n\"Bacall to Arms\", is a 1946 Looney Tunes short, spoofing scenes from \"To Have and Have Not\", and featuring \"Bogey Gocart\" and \"Laurie Becool\". It is included as a Special Feature on the DVD release of \"To Have and Have Not\".\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

He was known for his smooth swing and his relaxed demeanour on the course, which earned him the nickname \"Mr. Icicle.\"\n\nBorn in Trenton, Texas, Mangrum became a professional golfer at age fifteen, working as an assistant to his brother Ray, the head professional at Cliff-Dale Country Club in Dallas. He joined the PGA Tour in 1937 and went on to win 36 events on the Tour. He might have won more if his career had not been interrupted by service in World War II. While serving in the U.S. Army and training for the D-Day landings, Mangrum was offered the professional's job at the Fort Meade golf course in Maryland, which would have kept him out of combat, but he declined. He was awarded two Purple Hearts after being wounded at Normandy and Battle of the Bulge. He was also awarded two Silver and two Bronze Stars while serving in General Patton's Third Army. His best years on tour came after the war: he led the PGA Tour money list in 1951 and won the Vardon Trophy for the lowest scoring average on the tour in both 1951 and 1953.\n\nMangrum's only major title came at the U.S. Open though he was runner-up in three majors and third in six more (including twice losing in the semi-finals in the PGA Championship when it was a match-play event). He lost a playoff for the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion to Ben Hogan and his famous one-iron. Mangrum finished in the top ten at the Masters Tournament ten consecutive years. He shot 64 in the opening round in 1940, a Masters record that stood for 46 years, until Nick Price's 63 in the third round in 1986.\n\nMangrum played on four Ryder Cup teams in 1947, 1949, 1951, and 1953. On the last occasion, he was a playing captain. He had a record of six wins, two losses, and no ties (), including three wins, one loss, and no ties () in singles matches.\n\nMangrum died at age 59 in Apple Valley, California in 1973. The cause of death was a heart attack, the 12th he had suffered. Mangrum was called \"the forgotten man of golf\" by sportswriter Jim Murray. Even though only 12 men have won more PGA Tour events, his reputation has been overshadowed by the other stars of his era who lived long, extraordinary lives such as Sam Snead; and fellow Texans Ben Hogan, Jimmy Demaret, and Byron Nelson. At the 1996 Masters, Nelson conducted a test. \"I asked three young pros if they ever heard of Lloyd Mangrum, and they never had.\" Nelson commented, \"Lloyd's the best player who's been forgotten since I've been playing golf.\" A quarter century after his death, Mangrum was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\n\nMajor championship is shown in bold.\n\nSource:\n\n\nSource:\n\n Defeated Ghezzi and Nelson in a playoff.

Completed in 1940, the short was released on January 4, 1941. Featuring Elmer Fudd and, ostensibly, Bugs Bunny, it is the first cartoon in which the name Bugs Bunny is given (on a title card, edited onto the end of the opening title following the success of \"A Wild Hare\"), but the rabbit is similar to the one seen and heard in \"Elmer's Candid Camera\" (though his voice is different) and other pre-Bugs shorts. It was directed by Chuck Jones (his first cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny) and written by Rich Hogan. Voices are provided by Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan. It was produced by Leon Schlesinger.\n\nElmer buys Bugs Bunny in a pet shop (for 98¢). When they get home, Elmer builds an enclosure for Bugs, and then serves him dinner (a bowl of vegetables) which Bugs acts angrily towards. Then Bugs is seen grumbling in the night and he eventually takes Elmer's bed as his own. Throughout the short, Bugs irritates Elmer in various ways—from dancing to attempts getting in the shower, etc.—which culminates when Elmer brutally attacks Bugs (in a dark room with humorous fireworks exploding) and sends him out of the house. However, Bugs manages to get back inside and reclaim Elmer's bed.\n\nBugs Bunny's voice is pitched noticeably lower than in later incarnations of the character. His character is also very different from the more familiar version of Bugs (and even the earlier prototype versions), having a much more aggressive, selfish, arrogant, almost thuggish personality rather than his usual fun loving and comic relief personality. This short is the only one where Bugs has yellow gloves instead of white and no visible front teeth and claims to not eat carrots (yet he eats them and other vegetables while complaining).\n\nThe music in the cartoon includes a variation on \"While Strolling Through the Park One Day,\" arranged by Carl Stalling, performed by Elmer and the rabbit. Elmer, of course, has trouble with many of the words, due to his \"rounded L and R\" speech impediment.\n\nThe rumbling on the other side of Elmer's bedroom was reused in a later cartoon, \"The Wabbit Who Came to Supper\".\n\n"}

He is not to be confused with Paul the Simple, who was a disciple of Anthony the Great. He is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church as well as the Orthodox Church.\n\nThe \"Life of Saint Paul the First Hermit\" (\"Vitae Patrum\" (\"Vita Pauli primi eremitae\")) was composed in Latin by Saint Jerome, probably in 375–376. Paul of Thebes was born around 227 in the Thebaid of Egypt. \n\nPaul and his married sister lost their parents. In order to obtain Paul's inheritance, his brother-in-law sought to betray him to the persecutors. According to Jerome's \"Vitae Patrum\" (\"Vita Pauli primi eremitae\"), Paul fled to the Theban desert as a young man during the persecution of Decius and Valerianus around AD 250. \n\nHe lived in the mountains of this desert in a cave near a clear spring and a palm tree, the leaves of which provided him with clothing and the fruit of which provided him with his only source of food until he was 43 years old, when a raven started bringing him half a loaf of bread daily. He would remain in that cave for the rest of his life, almost a hundred years.\nPaul of Thebes is known to posterity because around the year 342, Anthony the Great was told in a dream about the older hermit's existence, and went to find him. Jerome related that Anthony the Great and Paul met when the latter was aged 113. They conversed with each other for one day and one night. The Synaxarium shows each saint inviting the other to bless and break the bread, as a token of honor. Paul held one side, putting the other side into the hands of Father Anthony, and soon the bread broke through the middle and each took his part. When Anthony next visited him, Paul was dead. Anthony clothed him in a tunic which was a present from Athanasius of Alexandria and buried him, with two lions helping to dig the grave.\n\nFather Anthony returned to his monastery taking with him the robe woven with palm leaf. He honored the robe so much that he only wore it twice a year: at the Feast of Easter, and at the Pentecost.\n\nHis feast day is celebrated on January 15 in the West, on January 5 or January 15 in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and on 2 Meshir (February 9) in the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Anthony described him as \"the first monk\". \n\nMonastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite (Deir Anba Bola) is traditionally believed to be on the site of the cave where Paul lived and where his remains are kept. The monastery is located in the eastern desert mountains of Egypt near the Red Sea. The Cave Church of St. Paul marks the spot where Anthony, \"the Father of Monasticism\", and Paul, \"the First Hermit\", are believed to have met.\n\nHe is also the patron saint of the Diocese of San Pablo (Philippines) and is the titular of the Cathedral of the said Diocese in San Pablo, Laguna, Philippines.\n\nThe Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit was founded in Hungary in his honour in the 13th century. He is usually represented with a palm tree, two lions and a raven.\n\n\n\n"}

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services.\n\nSchofields station opened in 1870. It was named after John Schofield, a local pioneer who was a former convict who later settled in the area after building a saw mill beside the railway line. The former station was originally opened as a siding stop with a platform made from railway sleepers in the early 1870s on the western side of the track, which was later rebuilt in brick in 1888 along with a goods loop after the Richmond line was upgraded by John Whitton the then Engineer-in-Chief. The History of the Station and surrounding local area have been highlighted through signs placed near the entrances to both former and present station sites.\n\nThe old Schofields station consisted of a single side platform with street level access on the eastern side of the track. A pedestrian level crossing to the north of the platform allowed access to the other side of the track. An interesting feature of the station was the adjacent grain and produce facility that protruded into the railway platform. The old station closed on 3 October 2011.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, the track between Quakers Hill and Schofields was duplicated for more than three kilometres as part of the Rail Clearways Program. This was intended as the first stage of a broader plan to duplicate the line as far as Vineyard. In order to be able to continue the duplication towards Richmond, it was proposed re-align a short section of track and relocate Schofields station to a site with fewer space constraints, 800 metres south of the existing station. The proposal to relocate the station was a controversial one and raised concerns amongst residents and businesses located near the former station, in relation to accessibility and urban decay. Despite opposition to the plans from Blacktown City Council and the government's own local representative, John Aquilina MP, construction commenced and the station opened on 29 October 2011. The new station is located in a minimally developed area foreseeing future residential development and is designed to support a dramatic increase in patronage.\n\nThe station features a distinctive colour scheme of maroon and cream as seen on the tin roofing, inspired by the Station Master's residence at Riverstone station and reflecting on the European heritage of the local Richmond area and consists of an island platform. The station also includes indicator screens on the platforms and network status screens indicating trackwork or service interruptions on the concourse. The station is equipped for disabled access with lifts from street level to the concourse and to the platform levels.\n\n230 parking spaces are available at the station with 110 on the Railway Terrace side and 120 on the Bridge Street side (opened in mid December 2011), with both including disabled parking spaces. Although claimed to be three times the size of the previous station car park, issues have arisen concerning the size of the area. 40 bicycle racks are available. A \"Kiss-and-ride\" zone is located parallel to the bus interchange. As part of the relocation, a shared pedestrian and cycling path was built between the former station to the current site and a footbridge was constructed at the site of the former station to replace the pedestrian level crossing.\n\nA scoping study into rail investment to service Western Sydney and the proposed Western Sydney Airport was announced by the New South Wales and Australian governments in November 2015. The study's final report was released in March 2018. There was a plan to extend the Sydney Metro from Tallawong to Schofields, St Marys and the new Western Sydney Airport. There is also a plan to build a multi-deck carpark by 2020 to further serve the growing community and add extra train services to the T1 Richmond branch.\n\nDuring the week, T5 Cumberland Line services terminate at Schofields. Late night services throughout the week however, extend to Richmond, replacing T1 services at these times.\n\nBusways operates two route via Schofields station:\n\nSchofields station is served by one NightRide route:\n\n"}
{"id": "1971339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971339", "title": "History of the Arabic alphabet", "text": "History of the Arabic alphabet\n\nThe history of the Arabic alphabet concerns the origins and the evolution of the Arabic script. It is thought that the Arabic alphabet is a derivative of the Nabataean variation of the Aramaic alphabet, which descended from the Phoenician alphabet, which, among others, gave rise to the Hebrew alphabet and the Greek alphabet (and therefore the Cyrillic and Roman alphabets).\n\nThe Arabic alphabet evolved either from the Nabataean, \nor (less widely believed) directly from the Syriac. \nThe table below shows changes undergone by the shapes of the letters from the Aramaic original to the Nabataean and Syriac forms. The Arabic script shown is that of post-Classical and Modern Arabic -- notably different from 6th century Arabic script. (Arabic is placed in the middle for clarity and not to mark a time order of evolution.) \n\nIt seems that the Nabataean alphabet became the Arabic alphabet thus:\n\n\nThe first recorded text in the Arabic alphabet was written in 512. It is a trilingual dedication in Greek, Syriac and Arabic found at Zabad in Syria. The version of the Arabic alphabet used includes only 22 letters, of which only 15 are different, being used to note 28 phonemes:\n\nMany thousands of pre-Classical Arabic inscriptions are attested, in alphabets borrowed from Epigraphic South Arabian alphabets (however, Safaitic and Hismaic are not strictly Arabic, but Ancient North Arabian dialects, and written Nabataean is an Aramaic dialect):\n\nBelow are descriptions of inscriptions found in the Arabic alphabet, and the inscriptions found in the Nabataean alphabet that show the beginnings of Arabic-like features.\n\nCursive Nabataean writing changed into Arabic writing, likeliest between the dates of the an-Namāra inscription and the Jabal Ramm inscription. Most writing would have been on perishable materials, such as papyrus. As it was cursive, it was liable to change. The epigraphic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic.\n\nThe Nabataean alphabet was designed to write 22 phonemes, but Arabic has 28 phonemes; thus, when used to write the Arabic language, 6 of its letters must each represent two phonemes:\n\nIn the cases marked %, the choice was influenced by etymology, as common Semitic \"kh\" and \"gh\" became Hebrew \"ħ\" and \"ayin\" respectively.\n\nAs cursive Nabataean writing evolved into Arabic writing, the writing became largely joined-up. Some of the letters became the same shape as other letters, producing more ambiguities, as in the table:\n\nHere the Arabic letters are listed in the traditional Levantine order but are written in their current forms, for simplicity. The letters which are the same shape have coloured backgrounds. The second value of the letters that represent more than one phoneme is after a comma. In these tables, \"ğ\" is \"j\" as in English \"June\".\nIn the Arabic language, the \"g\" sound seems to have changed into \"j\" in fairly late pre-Islamic times, but this seems not to have happened in those tribes who invaded Egypt and settled there.\n\nWhen a letter was at the end of a word, it often developed an end loop, and as a result most Arabic letters have two or more shapes.\n\nAfter all this, there were only 17 letters that were different in shape. One letter-shape represented 5 phonemes (\"b t th n\" and sometimes \"y\"), one represented 3 phonemes (\"j ħ kh\"), and 5 each represented 2 phonemes. Compare the Hebrew alphabet, as in the table: \n\nThe Arabic alphabet is first attested in its classical form in the 7th century. See PERF 558 for the first surviving Islamic Arabic writing.\n\nIn the 7th century, probably in the early years of Islam while writing down the Qur'an, scribes realized that working out which of the ambiguous letters a particular letter was from context was laborious and not always possible, so a proper remedy was required. Writings in the Nabataean and Syriac alphabets already had sporadic examples of dots being used to distinguish letters which had become identical, for example as in the table on the right. By analogy with this, a system of dots was added to the Arabic alphabet to make enough different letters for Classical Arabic's 28 phonemes. Sometimes the resulting new letters were put in alphabetical order after their un-dotted originals, and sometimes at the end.\n\nThe first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic papyrus (PERF 558), dated April, 643. The dots did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the Qur'an were frequently memorized; this practice, which survives even today, probably arose partly to avoid the great ambiguity of the script, and partly due to the scarcity of books in times when printing was unheard-of in the area and every copy of every book had to be written by hand.\n\nThe alphabet then had 28 letters, and so could be used to write the numbers 1 to 10, then 20 to 100, then 200 to 900, then 1000 (see Abjad numerals). In this numerical order, the new letters were put at the end of the alphabet. This produced this order: alif (1), b (2), j (3), d (4), h (5), w (6), z (7), H (8), T (9), y (10), k (20), l (30), m (40), n (50), s (60), ayn (70), f (80), S (90), q (100), r (200), sh (300), t (400), th (500), dh (600), kh (700), D (800), Z (900), gh (1000).\n\nThe lack of vowel signs in Arabic writing created more ambiguities: for example, in Classical Arabic \"ktb\" could be \"kataba\" = \"he wrote\", \"kutiba\" = \"it was written\" or \"kutub\"=\"books\".\nLater, vowel signs and hamzas were added, beginning some time in the last half of the 6th century, at about the same time as the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew vocalization. Initially, this was done using a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an Umayyad governor of Iraq, Hajjaj ibn Yusuf: a dot above = \"a\", a dot below = \"i\", a dot on the line = \"u\", and doubled dots giving \"tanwin\". However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by al-Farahidi.\n\nBefore the historical decree by Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, all administrative texts were recorded by Persian scribes in Middle Persian language using Pahlavi script, but many of the initial orthographic alterations to the Arabic alphabet might have been proposed and implemented by the same scribes.\n\nWhen new signs were added to the Arabic alphabet, they took the alphabetical order value of the letter which they were an alternative for: \"tā' marbūta\" (see also below) took the value of ordinary \"t\", and not of \"h\". In the same way, the many diacritics do not have any value: for example, a doubled consonant indicated by shadda does not count as a letter separate from the single one.\n\nSome features of the Arabic alphabet arose because of differences between Qur'anic spelling (which followed the Meccan dialect pronunciation used by Muhammad and his first followers) and the standard Classical Arabic. These include:\n\nLess than a century later, Arab grammarians reorganized the alphabet, for reasons of teaching, putting letters next to other letters which were nearly the same shape. This produced a new order which was not the same as the numeric order, which became less important over time because it was being competed with by the Indian numerals and sometimes by the Greek numerals.\n\nThe Arabic grammarians of North Africa changed the new letters, which explains the differences between the alphabets of the East and the Maghreb.\n\nThe old alphabetical order, as in the other alphabets shown here, is known as the Levantine or Abjadi order. If the letters are arranged by their numeric order, the Levantine order is restored:-\n\n<br>This order is much the oldest. The first written records of the Arabic alphabet show why the order was changed.\n\nWhen the Arabic alphabet spread to countries which used other languages, extra letters had to be invented to spell non-Arabic sounds. Usually the alteration was three dots above or below:-\n\nSince the early 20th century, as the Ottoman Empire collapsed and European influence increased, many non-Arab Islamic areas began using the Cyrillic or Latin alphabet, and local adaptations of the Arabic alphabet were abandoned. In many cases, the writing of a language in Arabic script has become restricted to classical texts and traditional purposes (as in the Turkic States of Central Asia, or Hausa and others in West Africa ), while in others, the Arabic alphabet is used alongside the Latin one (as with Jawi in Brunei).\n\n"}

He was articled to a solicitor, and became active in the Chartist movement, but abandoned his legal studies and migrated to Victoria, Australia in 1853.\n\nHumffray arrived in Melbourne on the \"Star of the East\" on 19 September 1853, and moved to Ballarat two months later to try his hand at gold digging. At a protest meeting of over 10,000 diggers at Bakery Hill on Saturday, 11 November 1854, Humffray was elected secretary of the Ballarat Reform League. In his view, the diggers' grievances were the result of an unrepresentative political system, which he felt could be changed by moral suasion.\n\nHumffray was a member of the three-person delegation which met the Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, in Melbourne on Monday, 27 November 1854. The miners' demands for economic and political reforms were rejected. After a particularly vicious licence hunt, a meeting of the Ballarat Reform League was held on Thursday, 30 November 1854 at which the miners rejected \"moral force\" as advocated by Humffray. They embarked on the path of \"physical force\" by electing Peter Lalor as their leader, and deciding to meet force with force by building the Eureka Stockade.\n\nHumffray was not part of the rebellion and played the role of peacemaker in the lead up to the battle at the Eureka Stockade on 3 December 1854. He represented the interests of aggrieved diggers at the Commission of Enquiry into the discontent on the goldfields, and was a vocal defender of the 13 miners who were charged with high treason for their role in the rebellion. He was the editor of the short-lived Ballarat \"Leader\", first president of the Ballarat Mechanics' Institute, and passed first-year law, University of Melbourne (1860). As a result of losing money in mining speculations, Humffray became dependent on charity in his last years. After a long illness, he died a pauper on 18 March 1891.\n\nWhen the miners were granted the right to vote and representation in 1855 Humffray was elected unopposed as the member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Ballaarat (1855-1856); then Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for North Grant (1856-1859) then Ballarat East (1859-1871). He served as Minister for Mines (November 1860 to November 1861) and Chairman of the Royal Commission on Mining (1862).\n\nHumffray Street, one of the major roads in Ballarat, is named after him, with that being sometime prior to 1858.\n\nHumffray was an Anglican, and was buried in the Ballaarat Old Cemetery, near those who had died in the Eureka rebellion. A headstone was erected by the people of Ballarat.\n\n\n"}

The character was created by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and Mitch Brian for \"\" and was preemptively introduced into mainstream comics before the airing of her animated debut in 1992. The character has developed significantly.\n\nRenee is initially a detective from the Gotham City Police Department, assigned to the Major Crimes Unit, who comes into frequent contact with Batman. She is exposed as a lesbian and resigns from the police force, disgusted by its corruption. She operates as the Question out of a lighthouse that she shares with Aristotle Rodor on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Following a line-wide revision of the fictional world of DC Comics superhero comic books, the revised Montoya character appeared first in \"Detective Comics\" #41 (August 2015), in which she was established as Harvey Bullock's new partner. The character made her live-action debut on the first season of \"Gotham\" and was played by Victoria Cartagena. She made her cinematic debut in the DCEU film \"Birds of Prey\", and was portrayed by Rosie Perez.\n\nRenee was created for \"\" by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and Mitch Brian, described in the series bible. She first appears as a uniformed officer partnered with Harvey Bullock. In the follow-up series \"The New Batman Adventures\", Montoya has been promoted from police officer to detective. The comic series \"Gotham Central\" describes Montoya as the daughter of immigrants from the Dominican Republic.\n\nRenee is a recurring character in the Batman-related comics after \"Batman\" #475 (March 1992). After she is promoted to homicide detective by Commissioner James Gordon, Renee is partnered with Harvey Bullock. After Bullock is promoted to Lieutenant, Crispus Allen becomes Renee's new partner.\n\nGotham City is destroyed by an earthquake in the \"\" crossover. It is soon closed off from the rest of the United States in the story arc. Montoya and Bullock are two of the many Gotham police officers to stay behind with James Gordon in order to keep the peace among the people who remain.\n\nRenee is the focus of an uneasy truce between Gordon's forces and the crime boss Two-Face. She reaches out to Two-Face's Harvey Dent persona in helping with aid and relief efforts, and he falls in love with her. In fact, he keeps her restrained in his headquarters against her will. She becomes involved when Two-Face puts James Gordon on trial for perceived wrongdoing. Renee persuades Two-Face to offer a more fair trial, giving Gordon a defense lawyer. Two-Face's Harvey Dent persona takes on this role, and ultimately convinces Two-Face to allow everyone to go free.\n\nGotham City is later re-opened thanks to humanitarian efforts spearheaded by Lex Luthor. Renee, Gordon, Bullock and the surviving officers are re-instated as a police official.\n\nIn \"Officer Down\", Renee is hit hard by a murder attempt on Gordon, and when the assassin walks free, goes to seek vengeance. However, Bullock catches her in the act and persuades her not to pull the trigger, telling her that revenge is not worth her career.\n\nMontoya is one of the main characters of \"Gotham Central\", a comic book series about the Gotham City police department. Believing that the only way to have Montoya is to take everything away from her, Two-Face outs her as a lesbian to the public and frames her for murder. He then kidnaps her, making it look like Montoya has escaped. Two-Face becomes more unstable and the two fight for control of his gun until Batman arrives to save them. Montoya is cleared of all charges and Two-Face returns to Arkham, but Montoya's personal life becomes chaotic, especially with her family: while her younger brother knows about and, to a limited extent, accepts her sexuality, her religious parents disown her.\n\nIn the 2004–2005 \"\" storyline, Montoya and Crispus Allen are ambushed by the Black Spider, and Allen shoots the villain. A corrupt crime scene investigator named Jim Corrigan steals and sells the bullet on the Internet, but the bullet is needed to prove that the shooting was self-defense. In her pursuit of the bullet, Montoya beats the name of the buyer out of Corrigan. Although Allen is cleared, Montoya becomes obsessed with exposing Corrigan. Allen tries to persuade Montoya to let it go, but Montoya refuses, so Allen investigates Corrigan independently. During his investigation, one of Allen's informants is murdered shortly before Allen himself is shot and killed by Corrigan. Montoya takes it upon herself to bring Corrigan to justice. Tracking him down, Montoya beats Corrigan's girlfriend unconscious and draws a gun on Corrigan. He begs for his life, and Montoya finds she cannot pull the trigger. Montoya quits the GCPD the next day, disgusted and broken.\n\nIn the 2006–2007 series \"52\", Montoya, now an alcoholic ex-cop, spends her days in bars and her nights obsessing about the loss of her job and girlfriend Daria who had walked out on her three months previously unable to watch Renée \"destroy herself.\" The Question shines a Bat-Signal, modified to throw a question mark, at her window, asking if she is ready.\n\nThe Question believes that Intergang is preparing for an invasion of Gotham, and to that end, hires Montoya to surveil a warehouse in Gotham City, where they uncover futuristic weapons.\n\nDuring Week 14, Montoya and the Question fly to Kahndaq, and track down some leads on Intergang. Abbott, the wolf creature, tracks them. After they leave an empty warehouse, they are taken prisoner by members of Black Adam's army.\n\nNightwing and Montoya find a strange device in a warehouse guarded by hybrid creatures. Nightwing hypothesizes that it is a bomb. Attacked by several Intergang henchmen, the pair are helped by a disillusioned Kyle Abbot. The device is activated, erupting in a pillar of flame. At the same time numerous other devices are also activated, as Intergang attempts to destroy Gotham by fire. Montoya wears Charlie's mask for the first time, going after Bruno \"Ugly\" Mannheim as the Question, and finds Mannheim and Whisper A'Daire about to use Kate as a sacrificial victim. Montoya sets Whisper A'Daire on fire, but is about to be killed by Mannheim when Kate stabs him with the ceremonial knife and collapses in Montoya's arms.\n\nMontoya appears in \"Countdown\" #40 when Oracle solicits her help in capturing the Trickster and the Pied Piper, suspected of the murder of Bart Allen. The two criminals escape the Suicide Squad only to be apprehended by Montoya and Batwoman. Montoya agrees to their release, concluding they are too stupid to be murderers. Montoya maintains that she will not become a member of the Birds of Prey, but Oracle calls upon her to accompany the Birds of Prey in \"Gotham Underground\" #2.\n\nShe later stars in Greg Rucka's 2007 limited series, \"Crime Bible: Five Lessons of Blood\", in which she pursues the Crime Bible and withstands its adherents' efforts to convert her to their cause. In Grant Morrison's \"Final Crisis\" (2008), Montoya informs Dan Turpin that she is investigating the Dark Side Club. She later battles Frankenstein and the agents of S.H.A.D.E. during her investigation of an apocalyptic conspiracy related to the Crime Bible (now in possession of Libra) and Darkseid. She is accosted by S.H.A.D.E. agents in her civilian identity when she assists a dying German Supergirl from a parallel world.\n\nMontoya appears in the \"\" miniseries by Greg Rucka. While trying to stop members of the Religion of Crime from obtaining a mystic weapon, she is confronted by the Spectre (whose current host is Crispus Allen, Montoya's former partner). The Spectre states that she is about to receive judgment. He is stopped by Radiant, the Spirit of Mercy, who embodies the ideal of Christian love as introduced by Jesus.\n\nMaggie Sawyer, corrupted by the Anti-Life Equation, emerges from Gotham Central along with the rest of the brainwashed police force. They attempt to unleash the Equation on Montoya, but are stopped by the intervention of the Spectre and Radiant. The Spectre is not able to hold them off for long, because they are protected by the same force that protects Libra. Radiant makes sure that Montoya cannot be brainwashed, and teleports her away. Observing the surroundings, she finds Batwoman lying in the streets. Batwoman reveals that she now obeys Darkseid as well, and starts to recite the Equation. It appears, however, that Montoya is completely immune to the Equation; in the following issue, she is seen in complete control of her own mind.\n\nMontoya appears in \"Final Crisis\" #5, recruited by the underground resistance movement organized by Checkmate. She is told that she must travel the DC Multiverse and gather help for New Earth. In \"Final Crisis\" #7 she is seen accompanied by Captain Marvel (of Earth 5) where she gathers a group of alternative versions of Superman that help end the Final Crisis and defeat Mandrakk the Dark Monitor. She identifies herself as a \"Global Peace agent\" in \"Final Crisis\" #7—an allusion to the faceless agents of the GPA from the original OMAC series.\n\nStarting in \"Detective Comics\" #854, Montoya appeared in an ongoing backup feature written by Greg Rucka, with art by Cully Hamner.\n\nMontoya takes the case of a missing illegal immigrant—the young sister of the man named Hector Soliz seeking her detective services. She follows some leads to their hideout and discovers pornographic pictures of the girl, indicating she may have become involved in a child pornography or sexual slavery ring. While investigating a businessman whom she believes is involved with the slavery, Montoya is kidnapped and left to die after being tied up in the trunk of a car that is driven into a river. She easily escapes and eventually tracks the slaves to a boat owned by the businessman. After a brief fight with several henchmen, the police arrive and rescue the women, reuniting Hector with his sister.\n\nWhen Montoya briefly returned to Gotham City, she worked with the new Batman and quickly realized that he was Nightwing. Her old partner Bullock also discovered that Renee is the new Question, pointing out that he worked with her long enough to be able to recognize her butt anywhere.\n\nDuring the events of the 2009–2010 \"Blackest Night\" storyline, Montoya is tracked down by Lady Shiva, who claims that she wishes to test her in combat to see if she is a worthy successor to Victor. The two women engage in a brutal fist fight, only to be interrupted when Victor, now reanimated as a Black Lantern, arrives on the scene and attacks them. After a drawn out battle, Renee discovers that Black Lanterns feed on emotions, and that if she is able to cut herself off from her feelings, she will become invisible. She does so, and angered, Victor stalks off into the night, searching for easier prey. Shiva reveals that she never intended to actually fight Montoya, but felt that attacking her would draw Victor out into the open so she could face him again.\n\nSome time after this, Montoya teams up with the Huntress in order to bring down the criminal network that Renee had earlier encountered. Eventually, the hitman known as Zeiss attacks the women, having been ordered by an unknown client to kill them. Renee appeals to the hitman's greed, offering him more money if he simply fakes their deaths and leaves them be. After this, Huntress takes Renee to Oracle for help in tracking down the client who put out the hit, and is flabbergasted upon discovering that Oracle is in fact \"Commissioner Gordon's daughter\". The two women eventually make their way to Oolong Island (home of the Doom Patrol), where they are arrested. After escaping from police custody, Huntress and the Question discovered that Vandal Savage is behind the human trafficking network they had been trying to shut down. Savage offers to shut down his criminal network in exchange for one of them taking the Mark of Cain, which had been branded onto his face by the Spectre during the events of \"Final Crisis\". Renee ultimately chooses to accept the Mark of Cain, ending Savage's reign of terror but leaving her face disfigured.\n\nFollowing this, the Question appears alongside Batwoman as part of Wonder Woman's team of superheroines when a group of aliens attack Washington D.C. Rose Wilson jokingly asks her if she intends to seek an autograph from Wonder Woman, only for Renee to nervously remark that she is trying to work her way up to asking for one.\n\nMontoya seeks out Richard Dragon, who helps her learn to suppress the Mark through her mental willpower. Following , he establishes Batman, Inc., a global network of Batmen from various nations. Batman sends Renee to Paris, France in order to infiltrate the Golden Portal, a violent cult responsible for a number of deaths. Renee allows herself to be captured and brainwashed by the cult's leader, Korrigan, and ultimately uses mental techniques taught to her by Richard and Victor to overcome Korrigan. With help from Batman and the French vigilante Nightrunner, the members of the Golden Portal are defeated and Korrigan is arrested.\n\nAs part of The New 52, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe' continuity, Montoya appears in an image viewed by Batwoman on the GCPD's wall of honor. At the 2014 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, James Tynion IV, a writer on \"Batman Eternal\", revealed that the creative team almost included Montoya, but they decided against it, saying, \"We cut her out because we didn't want her to just be in the background of the GCPD. We want to bring her back for her own big story.\"\n\nMontoya first appeared in the post-New 52 continuity in \"Detective Comics\" #41, as Harvey Bullock's new partner.\n\nFor the early part of the Rebirth era, Montoya appeared sporadically in \"Detective Comics\", still working for the GCPD and slowly rebuilding her relationship with Kate Kane. The two eventually became a couple again in the final issue of the Rebirth \"Batwoman\" series, a development that has continued into the present.\n\nIn July 2019, Montoya debuted as the Question in \"Lois Lane\" #1 as a supporting character. As the Question, she also plays a minor role in \"Event Leviathan\", also from 2019.\n\n\nIn the alternate future seen in the \"Titans Tomorrow\" storyline, Renee Montoya has become the commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department long after a crisis claimed the life of Batman. When Tim Drake became Batman and started killing the villains of Batman, Montoya and her predecessor James Gordon worked to hunt him down.\n\nIn the first issue of Batman's debut in \"Smallville\" season 11's comic series, Barbara Gordon/Nightwing mentions eluding cops named \"Allen and Montoya\".\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" storyline, Renee Montoya is a bar owner and bartender. She is defensive of one of the alcoholic patrons, Bullock.\n\nDuring the 2013–2014 \"Forever Evil\" storyline, a version of Renee Montoya appears on Earth-3 where all heroes are villains and vice versa. Renee's \"evil\" counterpart appears in Alfred Pennyworth's flashback. This version of Renee Montoya is still a member of Gotham City Police Department. However, she is a corrupt cop and like the rest of GCPD of this universe who works under Owlman. She is seen with the Earth-3 version of Harvey Bullock in an alleyway pulling their guns out and stopping a family who was out watching a movie nearby. They demand the family to empty out their purses and wallets \"in the name of the law.\" The family, however, are also armed with guns and begin firing. They request for backup, but it is denied as the rest of the police are currently helping Owlman track down the Joker (who is a hero in this universe). Renee and Bullock are then run over by Alfred despite them being allies since the Outsider was trying his best to follow Owlman. It is unclear whether Alfred did not see them or he simply did not care as he was in a high-speed chase with the Joker. Renee was either killed from her injuries or when Earth-3 was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor.\n\nIn the prequel comic to the game \"\", Renee was married to Kate Kane, and part of the Insurgency group in a world oppressed by Superman's Regime. Both sides use performance-enhancing pills granting them superhuman strength, speed, and durability. After the loss of Huntress, Renee became enraged, taking all the pills she could find and heavily overdosed on them with the intention of gaining enough strength to take down Superman on her own, well aware she would die from the drug. She then took out Cyborg in a single blow, took Robin hostage, and challenged Superman to a duel. During the fight, she kept taking additional pills (tripling the already deadly dosage) in an attempt to match or exceed her opponent, until her heart failed because of the strain the chemicals put on her body. Bruce Wayne collected her body and buried her next to the graves of Green Arrow and Black Canary.\n\nIn \"DC Comics Bombshells\", set in an alternate history 1941, Montoya is a Republican veteran of the Spanish Civil War, now in Berlin fighting with the German resistance group led by Countess Selina Digatti. Montoya was a lover of Kate Kane when the latter fought in the Civil War as one of the American volunteers, though they were driven apart after the death of Jasón, whom they considered their son. She also serves as the Question in this continuity.\n\nRenee Montoya was ranked as the 80th-greatest comic book character of all time by \"Wizard\" magazine. IGN also listed Montoya as the 87th-greatest comic book hero of all time: a character representing ethnic diversity, who has undergone a tremendous personal transformation from humble beginnings.\n\n\n\nRenee Montoya appears in \"Gotham\", portrayed by Victoria Cartagena. In this continuity, she is a recovering drug addict and the former lover of Detective James Gordon's fiancée Barbara Kean. She works in the Major Crimes Unit of the Gotham City Police Department where her partner is Crispus Allen. Upon learning that Don Carmine Falcone ordered Detective Jim Gordon to kill Oswald Cobblepot, it is implied that she does not believe he did it but she nevertheless becomes obsessed with having him convicted in order to win Barbara back. She and Allen find a witness at the Gotham pier who saw the shooting, and they promptly issue a warrant for Gordon's arrest at Barbara's apartment. However, her case is ruined when Cobblepot turns up, alive, at GCPD headquarters. She later saves Gordon during a shootout with Victor Zsasz, and promises to help him take on the mob. However, it is revealed that after Gordon's fiancée left him she returned to Renee to begin a new lesbian sexual relationship, but Montoya eventually pushes her away when Barbara reveals she is still in love with Gordon.

{"id": "1971404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971404", "title": "North Region (Cameroon)", "text": "North Region (Cameroon)\n\nThe North Region () makes up 66,090 km² of the northern half of The Republic of Cameroon. Neighbouring territories include the Far North Region to the north, the Adamawa Region to the south, Nigeria to the west, Chad to the east, and Central African Republic to the southeast. The city of Garoua is both the political and industrial capital. Garoua is Cameroon's third largest port, despite the fact that the Bénoué River upon which it relies is only navigable for short periods of the year.\n\nMajor ethnic groups include the Fula or Fulani (; ), who are Islamic pastoralists, and numerous Muslim and animist speakers of Adamawa, Chadic, and Nilo-Saharan languages. French is the language of formal education, and Fulfulde, the language of the Fulbe, is widespread as a \"lingua franca\".\n\nIn 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing \"Provinces\" and replacing them with \"Regions\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions.\n\nBands of alternating metamorphic and sedimentary rock interspersed with granite characterise the north's geology. Granite covered in volcanic basalt makes up the southernmost reaches, which form part of the Adamawa Plateau. A series of faults lies north of this and separate the plateau from the band of metamorphic stone to its north. Random granite deposits also characterise this area. The Mayo Rey and Vina River cut north of this portion, leaving deposits of sedimentary stone except in the granite east. North of this lies a band of sedimentary alluvium, clay, limestone, and sandstone. Faults tentatively follow the Bénoué River north of this and form a barrier to split the remainder of the province, with metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, mica, and schists dominating to the south and sedimentary stone making up the north. Another large band of metamorphic rock makes up the territory northwest of the Bénoué basin. The Mandara Mountains, which run roughly north–south at the province's Nigerian border, are irregular in that they are volcanic, composed mostly of crystalline and metamorphic rock and granite.\n\nThe Adamawa Plateau divides the province into two main soil types. Those to the north are mostly shallow and ferruginous, brown or brownish red in colour. On the plateau itself, they are mostly ferralitic or lateritic. The region's annual rainy/dry cycle erodes the landscape and aids in the formation of iron deposits called duricrust or hardpans near the surface. in addition, the area between the Vina and Mbere Rivers and the Mayo Deo valley is hydromorphic, while the volcanic Mandara and Atlantika Mountains, other high points in the province, and the Mayo Oulo valley are composed of relatively young soils high in raw mineral content. The bottom of the Bénoué basin is alluvial soil.\n\nAll rivers in the province experience a tropical regime, with a period of high water during the rainy season during which flooding may occur. The Bénoué, Mayo Oulo, Mayo Kébi, and Mayo Godi are particularly susceptible to this (\"mayo\" is the Fulfulde word for river). In contrast, however, the rivers mostly dry up during the dry season, many disappearing completely into the sand. Animals and humans must dig during this period to retrieve water. This means that the port of Garoua on the Bénoué is only functional during a small portion of the year.\n\nThe Bénoué River (Benue) serves as the North's primary waterway, as it passes through the port at Garoua. It flows down from the Adamawa Plateau and is enlarged by the Mayo Rey, the Mayo Kebi (which flows into the area from Chad), the Mayo Louti (which flows down from the Mandara mountains) and other rivers. Its valley forms the main part of the Bénoué Depression. Several smaller tributaries also flow into the Bénoué. All of these waterways form part of the Niger basin.\n\nThe Lagdo Reservoir is formed by a dam at Lagdo that traps waters from the Benoue and its smaller tributaries the Mayo Godi, Mayo Rey, Mayo Sina, Mayo Oldiri, and others, many of which rise on the Adamawa Plateau. The reservoir provides an important source of hydroelectric power for Cameroon's three northern provinces. Local villagers also use it as a source of fish, and both the lake and the river are used for irrigation.\n\nAnother significant river is the Vina, which rises in the Adamawa Province, flows through the North, and then empties into the Logone River in Chad. It is swelled by the Mbéré River east of Touboro. Before this, the Mbéré forms the province's southeastern border with Chad for several kilometers. These are the only major rivers in the province that form part of the Chad basin.\n\nThe Bénoué Depression constitutes the North Province's primary land feature. This basin runs along the Mayo Kébi and Bénoué River and has an elevation of between zero and 200 metres. The valleys surrounding the various rivers that feed the Kébi and later Bénoué reach elevations only slightly higher than this, averaging 200–500 metres in the north and 500–1000 metres in the south (the dividing line is at about 8˙ N). Garoua lies at about 235 metres. Farther north is the Kaélé Elevation. A major fault runs north of the Bénoué, roughly parallel to it.\n\nSouth of the Bénoué Depression lies the Adamawa Plateau. This descends to the Depression in escarpments and peaks of between 1000–2000 metres that follow a major fault. Past this frontier region, the plateau slopes south and southeast into the Adamawa Province and Chad.\n\nThe North's third significant land feature is the Mandara Mountains and their southern extension, the Atlantika Mountains, the likely results of tectonic activity. These chains form most of the western edge of the province, with peaks as high as 1000 metres. The mountains continue north into the Far North Province and Nigeria, though their elevations gradually drop to as low as 500 metres. The surrounding terrain is hilly. The North's highest elevation is Hosséré Vokré (Vokne), an isolated peak of 2,049 metres.\n\nFrom the bénoué Depression south, the North experiences tropical climate of the Sudan type. Average rainfall is between 900–1500 mm per year, decreasing from south to north due to elevation. Garoua, the major city, thus receives between 500–1000 mm per year. Rainfall in the Bénoué Depression is unpredictable, though it rarely drops to less than 1000 mm in any one year. North of the Bénoué Depression, a Sahel climate prevails. Here, the dry season lasts longer, and temperatures reach even higher levels. Provincial temperatures average 24 °C in the south along the plateau. In the Depression, they rise to 26 °C. North of the reservoir, temperatures climb as high as 28 °C.\n\nSeasons follow a wet/dry pattern, with rough divisions in November (dry) and April (wet). The year begins under the influence of the harmattan winds in the dry season. In this period, temperatures are at their highest and rainfall is virtually nonexistent. This period of stifling heat continues until April, which brings with it torrential rains and lower temperatures. Rains ease up in June, though temperatures remain lower and humidity relatively high. Then in November, the province becomes drier and temperatures cool as a shadow of winter sets in.\n\nThe North Province is a land of savanna. This begins with wooded savanna on the Adamawa Plateau with its thick grasses and isolated copses of trees. This territory was once more heavily forested, but repeated burning and livestock trampling has left this original vegetation only in the valleys. Moving north, the wooded savanna gradually gives way to Sudan savanna or parkland savanna in the Bénoué Depression. Here grass cover thins out, and trees become fewer and more isolated, and stunted shrubs become more prevalent. Common species include acacia, baobab, and various palms. Most of these have adapted to the region's harsh dry season and seasonal burning by growing thick bark and shedding their leaves during this period. This area has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the East Sudanian savanna ecoregion.\n\nAfter centuries of human habitation and manipulation, very little of the North's indigenous wildlife survives. Of the countless species that once roamed the area, today only hippopotami, jackals, various monkeys such as baboons, and various species of reptile exist in human-inhabited areas. The region's full diversity of species is today only extant in the handful of protected areas. The Bénoué National Park (\"Parc National de la Bénoué\") protects 1,800 square kilometres southeast of Garoua at the province's centre. It shelters many large mammal species, including hartebeest, hippopotami, kob, and waterbuck, as well as smaller numbers of buffalo, giant eland, elephants, lions and reptiles such as crocodiles. It has been a protected area since 1968.\n\nThe 2,200 square kilometres Bouba Njida National Park (\"Parc National de Bouba Ndjida\") is southeast of Garoua on the Chad border. Cameroon created the park in 1968 to protect the black rhinoceros and Derby eland. Many experts today say that the rhinoceros is now extinct in the area today. Other animals in the park include buffalo, elephants, giraffes, leopards, lions, and hippopotami.\n\nFarthest south is Faro National Park (\"Parc National du Faro\"), which protects 3,300 square kilometres of terrain straddling the Adamawa Plateau and the Bénoué Depression. The park houses many reptile species as well as elephants, giraffes, and hippopotami. Today, however, poachers have wiped out much of the park's animal population.\n\nThe North Province is moderately populated, averaging 12 to 25 people per km² in most areas. This density jumps to 25 to 50 people in the river valleys west of the Lagdo Reservoir and in the Bénoué Depression. North of Garoua and in the Mandara Mountains, where large populations of non-Muslim (often known collectively by the derogatory name Kirdi) were forced to flee years ago, density peaks at 50 to 100 people per km². Due to the major port located there, Garoua was at one point Cameroon's third largest city, though its population is 235,996 (2005 Census). The city is today a mélange of the region, with large populations of Fulbe, non-Muslim Northerners and immigrants from Southern Cameroon, as well as from neighboring Chad and Nigeria.\n\nDwelling units differ from ethnic group to ethnic group, but many follow a fairly common pattern. The house of the chief often forms the centre of a village, and houses are grouped around it with granaries nearby to help the villagers survive the dry season. Various fields of crops in turn surround homes. A common house type is a round building with a cone-shaped roof. However, houses of cement brick and roofed in sheet metal are quite common in larger settlements. Villages are often clustered along the main roads.\n\nIn contrast to the province's various settled peoples, the Mbororo Fulbe are nomadic and live in portable, tent-like huts (again, Mbororo is a derogatory word). They do establish semi-permanent settlements called \"ruga\", however, to care for the aged and for women to raise children while their husbands are out to pasture.\n\nWith the exception of small populations of Hausa, Shuwa Arabs, and expatriate Westerners in Garoua, the ethnic groups of the North speak languages of three major language families: Niger–Congo ('Adamawa'), Chadic, and Central Sudanic.\n\nThe Adamawa-language speakers occupy the majority of the territory. The Mbum inhabit much of Faro division and a large southeastern portion of Mayo-Rey division, with the Dii occupying the vast area in between. The land west of the Mayo Rey is home to several peoples on a roughly south–north axis: Chamba, Fanbe, Gimbe, Komandera, and Vere. The Doayo live east of the river, and the Ndupa, Dugun, another group of Chamba, and the Voko of Poli village neighbour them to the south. The Mond capital is at Rey Bouba, and the Mundang and Mambeya live on the Chadian border at the northeast of Bénoué division. Four Fali groups, with territories in the Bénoué and Mayo-Louti divisions, form the last member of the Adamawa group: the Fali proper, the Fali Bussime, the Fali Durbeyi, and the Fali Kangu.\n\nAt the province's borders live various Chadic-language-speaking peoples. The Njanyi begin this band at the northwest of the Bénoué division. The Gude lie to their north. Then, from west to east, the northern border is home to the Gawar, Daba, and Guidar. The Bata and Zim complete the Chadic speakers, with three separate concentrations of the former along the Nigerian border in Bénoué and Faro divisions, and two areas of the latter at the border with Chad and straddling the Bouba-Njida park. The Bata are further divided into the riverain Bata (west of Garoua and along the Bénoué river and into Nigeria) and the inland Bata (or Njirai), who inhabit the Zummo-Malabo Hills.\n\nAs the only ethnic group in the province to speak a Central Sudanic language, the Ngambay make up the third linguistic group. They live in a large territory on the border with Chad between the Vina River and the Mayo Godi.\n\nThough relatively newcomers to the region, the Fulbe or Fulani are the North Province's most numerous ethnic group. Their territory stretches through most of the province's centre, primarily in the Bénoué and Mayo Rey divisions. The Fulbe follow two distinct ways of living. The nomadic Fulbe, known to others but not themselves as Mbororo, are cattle herders. They roam the province's grasslands and south into the Adamawa Province, and their settlements are never more than semi-permanent. Mbororo are typically tall, thin people with a mixture of Semitic and African features. In contrast, those Fulbe who have settled are known as sedentary or town Fulbe. They outnumber their pastoral brethren, and they have over many years intermarried with their Sudanese neighbours, whom they now resemble. The North's Fulbe also recognize two main lineages, the \"wollarbe\" and \"yillarga\". The groups are traditionally rivals, though they often unite for common cause.\n\nMost North Province peoples speak their own distinct languages. Those with the most speakers include Daba, Dii, South Fali, Gidar, Adamawa Fulfulde (spoken by Cameroon's Fulbe), and Ngambay. Due to the Fulbe's numerical superiority and historical domination, Fulfulde is widely spoken as a lingua franca. French is the language of formal instruction.\n\nIslam is the dominant religion in the north due to the cultural and political domination of the Fulbe. Those ethnic groups who resisted the Fulbe conquests and forced Islamisation are collectively referred to by the pejorative term Kirdi (\"pagans\"), though they are not culturally homogenous and do not necessarily identify as a group. Non-Muslim groups include the Chamba and Fali. Some ethnic groups, such as the Mbum and the Guidar, are divided between Muslims and Christians. Many inhabitants of the province profess Christianity, particularly Catholicism.\n\nAs Cameroon's third busiest port, Garoua has long been a site of commercial development in the region. Despite the fact that the port is new but a shade of its former self, Garoua remains the economic centre of the North Province and of Cameroon's Grand North in general. The city is today a crossroads for goods travelling to and from Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria. The port is only viable during the wet season (July to October).\n\nMany of the North's ethnic groups farm on small plots for subsistence. The chief among these are the Mbum and Duru. Sorghum, millet (both fast- and slow-growing), and maize are the staple crop throughout most of the province, though manioc (cassava) is also important on the Adamawa Plateau, and rice is especially popular in cities. Other crops include yams along the Lagdo Reservoir and at Tcholliré and groundnuts in the Mayo-Rey division.\n\nFarmers often create their fields by burning an area of its vegetation during the dry season. Only fruit trees or trees useful for animal fodder or firewood are kept, such as baobab, faidherbia, and karita. Crops are planted at the first rains. Traditional farms are laid out in concentric circles centred on the village. These are surrounded by hedges or fences aimed at keeping out livestock. In the Mandara Mountains, these circular plots follow the slope of the mountains in terraces. Virtually nothing grows during the long dry season, so most food must be ground and stored in granaries for use during the rest of the year. Dry season sorghum (Muskwari) is grown along the river banks, relying on the moisture left behind as the rivers recede.\n\nCotton grows well in the North's river valleys and constitutes the major cash crop. Most cotton farms in the region are under the management of the \"\" (SODECOTON), which was established in 1974. Groundnuts are also important in the southern half of the province, especially at the edge of the Adamawa Plateau. The plateau is generally unsuited to commercial crops due to its hard soils.\n\nCattle are an integral part of the Fulbe way of life, particularly for the pastoral Wodaabe, who place great importance on the number of cattle an individual owns. They roam throughout the province and beyond while their town cousins keep animals around the province's central and northern settlements. The two major breeds are the humpbacked zebu, both the brown and white Fulani zebu, herded by the town Fulbe, and the leaner, lighter-coloured Bororo zebu, herded by the Wodaabe. Primary transhumance routes run through the Faro division and the southeast of the Mayo Rey division and eventually lead to Yaoundé, Douala, or farther south. Modern ranching occurs around the town of Faro, an endeavor made possible by the eradication of the tsetse fly from the region in 1974.\n\nOther livestock raised include sheep and goats in the Faro division and on the border northeast of the Mayo Rey division. Most of these are long-legged breeds of sheep and goats that are larger and taller than those of most of the rest of Cameroon. Horses and donkeys are used as beasts of burden and transportation throughout, and the Bata are renowned for their expert skills at horse breeding. Fowl are common, particularly in the northern portions.\n\nGaroua is the industrial heart of all of Cameroon's Grand North, and numerous factories dot the city. Among the goods produced in Garoua are beer and soft drinks, soap, cotton products such as textiles and cottonseed oil, construction materials, processed foods, and shoes. Figuil and Pitoa are smaller industrial centres. Figuil's factories produce cement and textiles, and those of Pitoa produce oils from groundnuts and cottonseeds. Guider and Touboro also have cotton gins.\n\nHandicrafts are an important cottage industry for many of the North's inhabitants. Many of the region's craftsmen deal with fabrics, and weaving of everything from clothing to prayer mats is an important source of income. The North is also home to many skilled embroiderers who finish the many textiles produced there. An artisanat at Garoua provides a major outlet for such craftsmen to sell their wares.\n\nMining forms a small aspect of the North's industrial complex. Limestone deposits are situated at the province's northern bulge, and uranium deposits lie in the Bénoué Depression near Poli. Workers mine tin ore from the area northwest of the Lagdo Dam.\n\nThe Lagdo Dam and Reservoir, which holds 4 cubic kilometres of water, provides a major source of hydroelectric power for Garoua and the area north of it (including the Far North Province).\n\nTravel in the North is relatively easy thanks to its large network of roads, many of which are paved. However, the area where the Adamawa Province descends to the Bénoué Depression is characterised by winding turns, and traffic accidents are not uncommon. In addition, the area is accessible by air. Garoua is the site of an international airport, and aircraft may land at Poli, Tcholliré, and Guider on airstrips. Finally, the port of Garoua makes the region accessible by boat, and the Bénoué is navigable all the way to Port Harcourt, Nigeria. This waterway is impassable in the dry season, however, and road is the preferred means of transporting goods through the area.\n\nTourism in the North Province is largely centred on hunting in its national parks. Of these, most travel guides recommend the 1,800 square kilometre Bénoué National Park as the most accessible and least poached. The park is popular among fishermen as well. Hunters also visit the Bouba Ndjida Park, though its thick vegetation and large number of rivers make it considerably more difficult to travel in. Faro National Park is little visited, as it is the least accessible to vehicles and it has been mostly poached out. Those who wish simply to \"view\" wildlife usually continue north to visit Waza National Park in the Far North. There is also a zoo in Garoua where many of the area's indigenous species are on view.\n\nThe province is divided into four departments\n\nThese are in turn broken down into subdivisions. Presidentially appointed senior divisional officers (\"prefets\") and subdivisional officers (\"sous-prefets\") govern each respectively.\n\nThe North enjoys a relatively high level of development in infrastructure thanks mainly to its most prominent native son, Ahmadou Ahidjo, Cameroon's first president. During Ahidjo's administration, his hometown of Garoua in particular saw much governmental attention, including state-of-the-art buildings and a modern airport.\n\nThe \"Union Nationale pour la Démocratie et le Progrès\" (UNDP) is the most important political party in the area due to its large base of Fulbe supporters. The UNDP has not presented much of a front in several years, however, because the ruling party, the \"Rassemblement démocratique du peuple camerounais\" RDPC, is careful to represent Fulbe interests.\n\nIn traditional Fulbe culture, several lamidos rule over individual populations of Fulbe subjects. The government of Cameroon allows these individuals to exercise relatively wide-reaching powers, so they can make laws, judge disputes, and intern prisoners. As the Fulbe possessed an independent emirate until relatively recently, they hold this traditional political structure in high regard. However, human rights groups have pointed to these extra-governmental leaders as some of Cameroon's most egregious human-rights abusers. The prisons at Bibémi, Gashiga, Rey Bouba and Tchéboa are particularly maligned, for example, and some groups even accuse lamidos of keeping slaves from the various Kirdi ethnic groups.\n\nMany of the North's smaller ethnic groups maintain traditional political organisation. The Bata divide themselves into several independent chiefdoms, for example. In some of these groups, however, traditional chiefs are mere figureheads. In others, the position does not exist at all.\n\nThe population of the North is one of Cameroon's lesser educated due both to traditional culture and to a dearth of schools. The cultural hindrance comes from the traditional role of Fulbe women; girls marry as young as age ten or eleven, and schooling typically stops at this time. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that fewer than 300 schools exist in a province of almost 1,500 villages. This compels parents interested in educating their children to send them away for most of the year, often to large towns where they must fend for themselves or stay with relatives. However, when agriculture forms such an integral part of most of the province's citizens, such a prospect may be tenuous at best.\n\nLike schools, hospitals in the North must serve a large number of spread-out villages. Most health centres are in larger towns or cities, necessitating long-distance travel for some citizens to receive care.\n\nMalaria is a major health concern. Similarly, fly-borne diseases such as dysentery sometimes break out, especially in more urbanised centres. Schistosomiasis is also a concern, though locals claim that the Lagdo Reservoir is free of the snails that carry the disease.\n\nThe Fulbe observe traditional Islamic holidays such as Ramadan and the Feast of the Ram. In addition, most of the province's non-Muslim peoples maintain a lively traditional culture that includes a number of special ceremonies, dances, and holidays. One of these is the Cock Festival, in which the nephew of the head of a family kills a cock and throws it into a fire; should the cock fall onto its right side, it is considered a good omen. The Tupuri people also perform the \"Gouma\", or the Dance of the Cock, a cacophony of drumming and tambourines and circles of long sticks. The \"Lam\" of the Guider people is a ceremony to display marriageable girls.\n\nThe flood plains of the Bénoué Depression have long attracted human settlement, as archaeological finds in the area and in Garoua attest. The Paleo-Sudanese, such as the Guider, represent the region's oldest continuous inhabitants. These peoples inhabited the region well before the 8th century. By the 9th century, various Neo-Sudanese groups migrated into the territory, among them the Chamba, Doayo, Fali, Mundang, and Mbum. The Chamba and Mbum proved the most warlike, forcing other groups to assimilate or find new homes. Over the years, the Mbum became quite cohesive, with a common language, social order, and ruler.\n\nThe Bata entered the area in two main waves. The first settled along the valley of the Bénoué River (River Benue), then the second continued south to Demsa Pwa (old Demsa). During this migration, the Bata fought and absorbed other peoples whom they met. The Bata also settled the site of Garoua (along with the Fali) in the 18th century. Other groups fled the Bata and settle elsewhere, such as the Chamba, Mbum, and Vere. The Chamba continued to migrate (due partially to internal squabbling) well into the colonial period, and they founded many settlements along the way, including Donga, Suntai, and Tissa.\n\nSome of Cameroon's other peoples lived in the territory of the North Province at one time or another. The Bali of the Northwest Province descend from the Chamba, for example. The Tikar of the Adamawa and Northwest Provinces probably migrated to their present location from the Bénoué Depression.\n\nThe territory fell to the control of the Islamic Kanem Empire under Sultan (or \"Mai\") Dunama (Dunam) II (r. 1221-1259). Thousands of cavalry subdued the area (known as Mabina) during this period. Under Kanem control, a governor presided over Mabina from the Kanem capital. The area was also nominally under the control of the \"kaigama\", the Kanem military commander and ward of its southern provinces.\n\nKanem control did not last long. Civil war erupted upon Dunama's death, as a succession of warlords occupied the territory in an ever-shifting succession of power. The old empire was not reunited until the reign of Ali Ghaji, who came to power in 1472 and set his capital at Bornu.\n\nSlavery and Islam are the two most enduring legacies of the Kanem-Bornu period. Slaves proved a lucrative commodity, and large numbers of them were transported from the area across the Sahara. Kanem-Bornu control brought Islam to the region between 1349 and 1385, though only a handful of elites or rulers ever converted.\n\nBeginning in the 13th century, small numbers of Fulbe herdsmen and settlers began streaming into the territory from present-day Nigeria. Over time, Fulbe numbers grew, and the immigrants began to shift from subservience to other ethnic groups to settling Fulbe-only settlements. They also embraced Islam beginning in the 17th century. By 1804, Fulbe numbers had reached the point where the herders had to seek new pastureland and the settlers tired of paying homage to non-Fulbe rulers. The sentiment reached its peak when Fulbe mystic Usman Dan Fodio declared a jihad in what is today northern Nigeria and Cameroon. Modibo Adama became lamido of Fumbina, charged with conquering the territory for Usman's Sokoto Empire.\n\nIn areas with sizable Fulbe populations, Adama's task proved fairly simple. The settlements at Bundang, Chamba, Chebowa, Deo, Faro, Garoua, Guringa, Kilba, Malaba, Rai, Song, Turua, and Zummo fell easily, Garoua in 1813. In other areas, Adama met with staunch resistance. He first struck at the Bata of Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. Fulbe raiders enslaved Bata resisters in great numbers, and those Bata who could fled south to found Demsa Mosu (new Demsa) and Bata Batchama to the north. Those peoples who were unwilling to submit to Fulbe supremacy were forced to flee, many of them to the forbidding Mandara and Atlantika Mountains.\n\nAdama allied with forces from Kanem-Bornu to pursue the Mandara people. He led the charge to conquer Guider by 1810, then he moved on the Mandara capital of Douolo. Adama took these settlements and other smaller ones. The remainder of the Mandaras fled to the mountains that today bear their name. Adama had reached well into the Adamawa Plateau by 1825.\n\nUpon Adama's death in 1847, almost all of northern Cameroon was under the rule of various Fulbe lamidos of the Sokoto Empire. What is today the North Province fell into the Garoua-Gurin and Song-Guider districts. The centralised administration (headed from Yola in present-day Nigeria) aided communication and trade throughout the region. Slaves formed a large portion of the economy, and were traded for horses and salt. In addition, the jihads cemented Islam as the dominant religion in the area.\n\nNon-Fulbe peoples were forced to either submit to Fulbe control (and the rule of non-native rulers) or to continue their resistance long after Adama's death. The Fali of the Bénoué Depression led the Fulbe to fortify Garoua, which they called Ribadou-Garoua. Meanwhile, the new Muslim empire attracted Muslims from other areas to immigrate, and Hausa, Bornu, and Shuwa Arabs moved in the late 19th century.\n\nThe explorer Dr. Heinrich Barth, a German under British patronage, visited Garoua in 1851 as a guest of the emir at Yola. Dr. Gustav Nachtigal, another German, led a later expedition in 1869. Nachtigal became a guest of the sultan of Bornu, and with his permission penetrated the area south to the Adamawa Plateau, where he remained until 1873. Nachtigal took careful note of the region's various peoples, their relations with one another, and those goods or produce that might prove attractive to German interests.\n\nGermany followed up on Nachtigal's findings by sending two Englishmen, J. H. Ashcroft and Edward E. Flegel, and a missionary named Hutchinson in 1879. The trio reached Garoua on 4 September and began the exploration of the upper Bénoué River. Flegel led a second expedition in 1882, travelling far and wide and negotiating treaties to give the Germans a monopoly on ivory in the area. He died in 1883, however, cutting the project short. Nonetheless, Germany annexed the \"Kameruns\" in 1884. Meanwhile, British traders set up trade in Garoua in 1890 for ivory, salt, and textiles.\n\nDespite the new overlords, the northern territory of the Kameruns was mostly ignored; it was difficult to reach and its goods were of little priority compared to those of the southern forest zone. The only significant northern focus for the colonials was the port at Garoua. The first German administrators reached the settlement in 1901. The Germans then continued the development of Garoua as a port and a gateway from North to West Africa. In 1902, Garoua became the capital of the Ngaoundéré and Garoua administrative unit.\n\nThe Germans left much of the administration of the territory to the traditional rulers. They particularly favoured the Fulbe lamidos, and they encouraged other ethnic groups to convert to Islam and thus fall under the control of these rulers. Nevertheless, those lamidos and other rulers who showed too much independence or disregard for German supremacy were ousted or killed.\n\nDuring World War I, Garoua and the surrounding territory formed a major focus of the British African front. Under Hugh Cunliffe, British troops attacked Garoua on 30 August 1914, but were repulsed. Cunliffe retreated to Yola (at this time also German territory). The Germans counterattacked, leaving Garoua defenseless. Cunliffe took the city and used it as a staging area for further gains against the Germans. After the German surrender of 1918, the present North Province territories fell under a League of Nations mandate, to be administered by France.\n\nThe French maintained a similar policy of governing the area through the Fulbe. Also like the Germans, recalcitrant rulers found themselves quickly deprived of their positions. Missionaries also entered the region, such as the Lutheran Fraternal Mission in Garoua in 1919.\n\nStill, the French largely ignored the area except for the Bénoué port, which they enlarged in 1930. They also introduced a hardier variety of cotton (allem) in 1931. The French orchestrated further road building in the area, including a major route from Foumban to Garoua via Ngaoundéré. In addition, Garoua received a large airport. The region fell into the Mora-Garoua division, administered from Garoua.\n\nUnder André-Marie Mbida, first premier of Cameroon after France granted it self-governance in 1956, the North's Fulbe majority rose in opposition, especially against the 1957 Abong-Mbang Resolutions. The Union Camerounaise political party with its large Fulbe support base formed the nerve centre for this opposition. In the resolutions, Mbida had called for a \"democratisation\" of Cameroon's north, which the lamidos saw as an attack on their traditional power. They thus threatened to secede to join French Chad, which set into motion a series of events that led to Mbida's resignation. Ahmadou Ahidjo, a northern Muslim, took his place on 18 February 1958.\n\nOn 1 January 1960, Cameroon gained its independence with Ahidjo its first president. The period of Ahidjo's presidency proved a boon to the territory, as the native son relished great projects on Garoua and the surrounding zone, particularly in the road network. He also initiated SODECOTON to supervise and ameliorate the region's cotton-based economy.\n\nThe Northern economy, long centered on Garoua, took a severe blow during the Biafra Secessionist War, which broke out in 1967 in Nigeria and severely hampered trade along the Bénoué. Even at the war's end in 1970, the port of Garoua never fully reached its previous levels of commerce.\n\nUnder Paul Biya, Cameroon's second president, the North continued to enjoy some improvements, as Biya was careful to cater to the region's Fulbe majority. Nevertheless, upon Biya's accession to power, the Cameroonian press accused an Ahidjo collaborator named Moussa Yaya of trying to turn the northern lamidos against the new president. Biya's main change to the region came in his splitting of Cameroon's Grand North into three provinces, the Adamawa, the North, and the Far North in 1983. That same year, Biya reshuffled his cabinet, and Ahidjo retaliated by urging all northern ministers to resign from the government. Biya retaliated by dismissing all ministers who had served under Ahidjo, claiming that some of them had participated in an assassination attempt on him. The alleged plotters were tried and found guilty on 27 February 1984. Ahidjo escaped to Paris. A further affront to Biya's rule came on 6 April 1984 when members of Cameroon's Republican Guard who hailed from the north attacked various government buildings in an attempt to overthrow the government. They also failed.\n\nIn the first months of 2014, thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the Central African Republic arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the North Region, East Region, and Adamawa Region.\n\n"}

It normally has a small alphanumeric keypad and an LCD screen of one, two, or three lines. The electronic diary or organizer was invented by an Indian businessman Satyan Pitroda in 1975. He is regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of hand-held computing because of his invention of the Electronic Diary in 1975.\n\nThey were very popular especially with businessmen during the 1990s, but because of the advent of personal digital assistants, and later smartphones in the 2000s and 2010s respectively, both of which have a larger set of features, electronic organizers are mostly seen today for research purposes. One of the leading research topics being the study of how electronics can help people with mental disabilities use this type of equipment to aid their daily life. Electronic organizers have more recently been used to support people with Alzheimer's disease to have a visual representation of a schedule.\n\nCasio digital diaries were produced by Casio in the early and mid 1990s, but have since been entirely superseded by Mobile Phones and PDAs.\n\nWhile Casio was a major role player in the field of electronic organizers there were many different ideas, patent request, and manufacturers of the electronic organizers. Rolodex who is namely known for their index card holders in the 1980s, Sharp Electronics who is mostly known for their printers and audio visual equipment, and lastly Royal electronics were all large contributors to the electronic organizer in its heyday.\n\n\n"}

It was released on October 29, 1990 as the follow-up to their 1988 debut, \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\". The band members again adopted pseudonyms for their contributions, using new names from the fictitious Wilbury brothers.\n\nThough it was their second release, the album was mischievously titled \"Vol. 3\" by George Harrison. According to Jeff Lynne, \"That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'\" \n\nAs the dynamics within the band had shifted with Roy Orbison's death, the four remaining members all adopted new Wilbury pseudonyms: Spike (George Harrison), Clayton (Jeff Lynne), Muddy (Tom Petty) and Boo (Bob Dylan). With Harrison and Lynne producing again, the sessions were undertaken in the spring of 1990. An additional track, a cover of \"Nobody's Child\", was recorded and released in June 1990 as a charity single in aid of Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal. The song was also the title track of a multi-artist fundraising album compiled by the Harrisons, \"\". \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\" was dedicated to the memory of \"Lefty Wilbury\" (Roy Orbison).\n\nReleased in October 1990, the album was less positively received than \"Vol. 1\", yet still saw a fair measure of success. In the United States, \"She's My Baby\" (with guest guitarist Gary Moore) and \"Inside Out\" became radio hits, charting at number 2 album rock and number 16 album rock, respectively. The album peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nComparing the two Wilburys albums, a reviewer in \"The New York Times\" wrote in November 1990: \"The superstar pop group stays close to 50's and 60's rock roots, drawing on blues, doo-wop, rockabilly and Buddy Holly. But their second album is faster, jokier, lighter and meaner than the first.\" \"Rolling Stone\" described the blending of the four participants' musical styles as \"seemingly effortless\", and said that the album showed they continued to enjoy their collaboration. In the years following \"Vol. 3\", there was speculation about further Wilbury releases. Since Harrison was viewed as the de facto leader of the group, his death in November 2001 ended the possibility of any future projects.\n\nWhen Harrison’s distribution deal with Warner Bros. expired in 1995, ownership of his Dark Horse Records catalog and the two Wilburys albums reverted to him, and the albums went out of print. On June 12, 2007, \"Vol. 1\" and \"Vol. 3\" were reissued by Rhino Records as \"The Traveling Wilburys Collection\", packaged together with bonus tracks and a DVD.\n\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nEngineered by\nRichard Dodd\n\n} \n} \n"}

She served as Adolf Hitler's hostess at many state functions and thereby staked a claim to the title of \"First Lady of the Third Reich\".\n\nShe was born Emma Sonnemann in Hamburg, Germany on 24 March 1893 to a wealthy salesman. After schooling, she became an actress at the National Theatre in Weimar.\n\nOn 13 January 1916, Sonnemann married actor Karl Köstlin in Trieste. Thereafter, she was known as Emmy Köstlin. In her autobiography, Göring said that she and Köstlin soon realized that they were more suited as friends and soon separated. They eventually divorced in 1926.\n\nOn 10 April 1935, she married the prominent Nazi and \"Luftwaffe\" chief Hermann Göring, becoming Emmy Göring. It was also Göring's second marriage; his first wife, Carin, had died in October 1931. She was given an unsolicited membership to the Nazi Party during Christmas 1938.\n\nTheir daughter, Edda, was born on 2 June 1938. Edda was reported as being named after Countess Edda Ciano, eldest child of Benito Mussolini. \"Time\" reported: \"Herr and Frau Göring became her fast friends.\" However, in her autobiography, Göring said her daughter was named after one of her friends.\n\nHermann Göring named his country house \"Carinhall\" after his first wife, while referring to his hunting lodge at Rominten (now Krasnolesye)the \"Reichsjägerhof\"as \"Emmyhall\".\n\nEmmy Göring served as Hitler's hostess at many state functions prior to the Second World War. This and her claim to be the \"First Lady of the Third Reich\" created much animosity between herself and Hitler's future wife, Eva Braun, whom she snubbed and openly despised. Hitler consequently issued angry instructions to Hermann Göring demanding that Emmy treat Eva with more respect; one of the outcomes of Emmy's condescending attitude toward Eva was that she was no longer invited to Hitler's Bavarian retreat, the \"Berghof\". As for Eva Braun, she allegedly never forgave Emmy for having assumed the role of \"First Lady of the Reich\".\n\nAs wife of one of the richest and most powerful men in Europe, she received much public attention, was constantly photographed, and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle well into the Second World War. Her husband owned mansions, estates and castles in Austria, Germany and Poland and was a major beneficiary of the Nazis' confiscation of art and wealth from Jews and others deemed enemies by the Nazi regime. Her husband celebrated their daughter's birth by ordering 500 planes to fly over Berlin (he stated he would have flown 1,000 planes as a salute for a son).\n\nAfter the end of the war, a German denazification court convicted her of being a Nazi and sentenced her to one year in jail. When she was released, 30 percent of her property was confiscated, and she was banned from the stage for five years.\n\nSome years after her release from jail, Emmy Göring was able to secure a very small flat in a building in the city of Munich and remained there for the rest of her life. In her final years, she suffered from sciatica. She wrote an autobiography, \"An der Seite meines Mannes\" (1967), published in English as \"My Life with Goering\" in 1972. \n\nEmmy Göring died in Munich on 8 June 1973 at the age of 80.

It comprises three peat bogs, Bettisfield Moss, Fenn's Moss and Whixall Moss. With Wem Moss (also an NNR) and Cadney Moss, they are collectively a Site of Special Scientific Interest called The Fenn's, Whixall, Bettisfield, Wem & Cadney Moss Complex and form Britain's third-largest lowland raised bog, covering . The reserve is part of the Midland Meres and Mosses, an Important Plant Area which was declared a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention in 1997. It is also a European Special Area of Conservation.\n\nThe mosses form an ombrotrophic raised bog, since the only source of water is from rainfall. Peat is formed when the remains of living plants, particularly Sphagnum, decompose in conditions where there is little oxygen, resulting in layers of peat up to thick in places, although this has been greatly reduced by commercial harvesting of the peat in many areas. In their natural state, such mosses form a dome of peat which can be up to higher than the surrounding surface, but the domes collapsed as a result of the drainage ditches created to allow harvesting to take place. Three major enclosures of the mosses have taken place, the first as a result of a voluntary agreement signed in 1704, and ratified by the High Court of Chancery in 1710, when opposition prevented the original plans from being carried out. Two Parliamentary enclosures, each authorised by an Act of Parliament were implemented in 1775 on Fenn's Moss and in 1823 on Whixall Moss. Both resulted in common rights being removed, and gave the landlords powers which paved the way for the subsequent commercial exploitation of the mosses.\n\nIn the early 1800s, the Ellesmere Canal Company built a canal across the southern edge of Whixall Moss. The engineers realised that maintenance would be required, to prevent the formation from sinking into the bog, and a gang of navvies, known as the Whixall Moss Gang, were employed continuously from 1804 to the early 1960s, to keep building up the banks of the canal, now renamed the Llangollen Canal. In the 1960s, the engineering issues were solved, when steel piling was used to underpin this section. The Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway also planned to cross the mosses, despite being ridiculed by the Great Western Railway for believing that such a thing was possible. They built their line across the north-western edge of Fenn's Moss in 1862, having cut drains in late 1861, and then put layers of heather, wooden faggots and sand on the formation, to allow it to float on the peat. Trains ran from 1862 until the 1960s, without sinking into the mire.\n\nCommercial cutting of peat began in 1851, and a series of six peat works were built over the years, as companies came and went. In order to extract the peat, a network of gauge tramways were used, with wagons pulled by horses. The first internal combustion locomotive was bought in 1919, to replace the horses, and three more locomotives were purchased in 1967 and 1968, but did not last long, as the tramway ceased to be used in 1970, to be replaced by Dexta tractors pulling trailers. Mechanised peat cutters were also introduced in 1968. By this time, all of the harvested peat was sold through the retail chain Woolworths, for use in horticulture. The Hanmer Estate, owners of Fenn's Moss, quadrupled the rents in 1989, and the existing operation was bought out by Croxden Horticultural Products. They geared up to extract much larger volumes of peat, to meet the increased rents, but opposition to using peat was increasing, and in late December 1990, the leases were bought by the Nature Conservancy Council, bringing an end to commercial peat cutting. Since then, the mosses have been managed by Natural England and Natural Resources Wales, who have blocked up drainage ditches and removed scrub, allowing water levels to rise, and the ombrotrophic bog to re-establish itself. Circular waymarked trails have been created through some areas of Fenn's and Whixall Mosses, and on Bettisfield Moss, to allow the nature reserve to be appreciated by visitors.\n\nFenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses straddle the border between England and Wales. Fenn's Moss is on the Welsh side of the border and is in Wrexham County Borough, while Whixall Moss is in north Shropshire, on the English side of the border, and is only separated from Fenn's Moss by the Border Drain, a ditch similar to many others on the mosses, which was dug in 1826. The former, now dismantled, Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway line crosses the north-western edge of Fenn's Moss. At the southern edge of Fenn's and Whixall Mosses, the former Ellesmere Canal, now rebranded as the Llangollen Canal, crosses the peat, and Bettisfield Moss lies to the south of the canal, partly in England and partly in Wales. A narrow band of peat connects it to Wem and Cadney Mosses, which again are divided by the Border Drain. Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses were declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1953, with Wem Moss being similarly notified ten years later. The sites were combined and extended in 1994, to become a single SSSI covering , of which are in Wrexham and in Shropshire. Together they form the third largest lowland raised bog in Britain, with only Thorne Moors and Hatfield Moors in South Yorkshire exceeding them in size. Bettisfield Moss covers , and includes the largest areas of uncut peat in the whole of the nature reserve, having been little affected by commercial peat cutting.\n\nTwo other mosses are part of the same geological Moss complex, though separated from Bettisfield Moss by a strip of agricultural land. Wem Moss in England is a National Nature Reserve which is owned and managed by the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, and is a good example of an uncut lowland raised bog. It covers an area of . Cadney Moss is in Wales, and has been largely reclaimed for agriculture and forestry.\n\nWhixall Moss and part of Bettisfield Moss sits above bedrock composed of fine red silt and sand, forming an impermeable layer once known as Upper Keuper Marls. To the north-west of these, the bedrock is composed of Upper Keuper Saliferous Beds, which contain rock salt. Both rock types were re-classified in 2008, and are now part of the Mercia Mudstone Group. As the last ice age receded, the area was covered with glacial moraine, consisting of sands, gravels and clays, in places up to thick, and this gives the area its characteristic undulating terrain. The shallower depressions filled with peat, and gave rise to the mosses, whereas some of the deeper depressions have remained as open lakes or meres. The depth of peat varies widely over the mosses, from over in parts of Bettisfield Moss and Fenn's Moss, to around on parts of Whixall and Fenn's Mosses where commercial peat digging was carried out, and there are some areas where such activity has exposed the underlying rocks.\n\nThe mosses are ombrotrophic raised bogs, meaning that they only receive water from rainfall. Such bogs form in areas with an annual rainfall of between which are relatively flat, or which sit over a basin in the underlying rocks, which helps to prevent water run-off. In their natural state, they form domes of peat, which can be up to higher than the surrounding surface. On the surface are living plants, particularly Sphagnum, which form a crust through which water can permeate relatively easily. Below that, the compacted plant remains are deprived of oxygen, which prevents the usual decay processes, causing them to become peat. Commercial exploitation of the mosses, and their consequent drainage, have resulted in water table levels dropping, and consequently less peat formation.\n\nFenn's Moss is the source of the Wych Brook, a tributary of the River Dee, which flows northwards from the Moss. The River Roden, a tributary of the River Tern, also rises in the vicinity of Bettisfield and flows southwards to form part of the border between England and Wales near Wem Moss. Near the south-eastern corner of Whixall Moss the never-completed Prees Branch of the Llangollen Canal branches off, to terminate after nearly a mile (1.5 km) at a marina, beyond which a little more of the route has become the Prees Branch Canal Nature Reserve Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nThere has been human activity on the mosses for millennia, as evidenced by archaeological finds. These include three bog bodies, the first of which was found by peat cutters in c.1867. The body, which was accompanied by a three-legged stool, was that of a young man wearing a leather apron, and was dated to the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body of a woman from the same period was found in c.1877, and that of a much older Early Bronze Age man was uncovered in 1889. The acidic water and the lack of oxygen resulted in their hair and skin being preserved, while their bones had dissolved. All three were re-buried in local churchyards, the first two at Whitchurch and the third at Whixall, where the remains would have quickly decomposed. In 1927, a Middle Bronze-Age looped palstave, a type of bronze axe, was discovered among remains of a band of pine trees which had crossed the Moss during that period, and can now be seen at the Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nThere is no documentary evidence for the cutting of peat on the mosses prior to 1572, but it is unclear whether this indicates that it was not general practice, or if there was just no need to burn peat when there was plenty of wood available. Subsequently, a right of turbary, to cut peat for burning was granted to individuals by the Lord of the Manor, and those who were found to be cutting peat but were unlicenced were fined, but the fines were quite modest, suggesting that it was a way of generating income for the Lord of the Manor rather than an attempt to stop the activity. From 1630 it is clear that higher fines were levied on those who sold the peat to people living outside of the manor, while by 1702, peat cutting was more closely regulated, and the levels of fine for unlicenced cutting, or for cutting turves in a neighbour's turf pit, were punitive.\n\nThe early 18th century saw attempts by the Lord of the Manor to ensure that he had better control of the area, and gained some income from the land. In Whixall, Thomas Sandford was the Lord of the Manor, but John Lord Gower also claimed similar rights for land he held in copyhold. The two men obtained the Statute of Merton and the Statute of Westminster, to allow them to enclose common land in Whixall, including parts of the mosses. The move was supported by around 50 people who held land either as freehold or copyhold, and an agreement was signed on 14 August 1704. The idea was to enclose of common land which were sufficiently dry to be usable for agriculture, while the rest of the common land was boggy, and was to be used as a common turbary. The freeholders and copyholders would be granted rights to around two-thirds of the land, with Thomas Sandford and John Lord Gower receiving most of the rest, and being granted to the parson in recognition of his conducting services in Whixall Chapel. In order to lay out the enclosures, six surveyors and mathematicians were employed, but the enterprise was opposed by 23 commoners, who proceeded to destroy existing fencing and prevented new fencing from being erected. The powers contained in the Statute of Merton were totally inadequate for such a situation, and a decree from the High Court of Chancery was obtained on 30 January 1710, to enable further progress to be made. Only were actually enclosed, but this included parts of Whixall Moss.\n\nWhile the enclosure of Whixall Moss was an enclosure by agreement, Fenn's and Bettisfield Mosses were subject to a Parliamentary enclosure, as a result of an Act of Parliament obtained in 1775. Such an act only needed the owners of two-thirds of the land to agree to it, and was used by landowners with large holdings to remove the rights of commoners. The major landowner in this case was the lawyer and politician Sir Walden Hanmer, and the act added the mosses to the parish of Hanmer. At the time, acts of enclosure were very common in England, but this was only the fourth to be enacted in Wales. Walden Hanmer appears to have been more interested in cultivating the wastes of the parish than in exploiting the peat on the mosses, but the act created 111 strips of land to be used as turbaries, of which Hanmer himself was awarded 56, two were given to the poor in Bronington, one to the school and almshouses in Whitchurch, and the rest shared out between 31 individuals. A similar act was obtained in 1823, which extinguished common rights on Whixall Moss and the English part of Bettisfield Moss. The act defined a number of public drains, which would carry water away from the moss, and as each was named, the act was probably recognising what was already there, rather than creating a new system.\n\nThe effects of the enclosures can still be seen, in the pattern of the fields that surround the northern and southern edges of the mosses, in the network of drains that carry water away from the mosses, and in the alignment of roads, tracks and footpaths that still provide access to them. The enclosures resulted in most of Fenn's Moss being under the control of the Hanmer Estate, and paved the way for the later commercial exploitation of the peat. On Whixall Moss, the result was that much of the southern part of the Moss was organised into a patchwork of small enclosures, and a much smaller proportion was under the direct control of the Lord of the Manor. Many of these small enclosures have since become pasture or woodland, although some remain as a source of peat turves for their owners.\n\nA decision that would affect the mosses was made in 1797, when the Ellesmere Canal company abandoned plans for a heavily-engineered route to join the two halves of their system, which would have linked Trevor Basin to Chester, via Ruabon and Brymbo, and decided instead to build a canal from Frankton Junction to Hurleston Junction, which was completed in 1805. The engineers William Jessop and Thomas Telford decided against building a bypass around the mosses, and instead elected to cut straight across the peat, despite the technical difficulties that this posed. They lowered the water table in the moss by building drainage ditches, and then constructed a raft, on which the canal floated. They understood that regular maintenance of this section would be a requirement for many years, and a team of navvies, later named the Whixall Moss Gang, were employed to extract clay from a pit on the Prees Branch. The clay was used to build up the banks, and the gang were employed continuously from 1804 until the 1960s on this task. Finally the engineering iisues that created the work were solved, and the canal was underpinned with steel piling in the 1960s, to isolate it from the peat. The idea that the drains defined in the 1823 Enclosure Act already existed is confirmed by the fact that they were carried under the canal in culverts, when the canal was built across the edge of Whixall Moss in c.1801.\n\nWhen railways arrived in the area, they also faced the decision of whether to cross the moss or bypass it. The main proposal was for the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway, the plans for which were opposed by some local landowners, and also by the Great Western Railway, who were keen to stifle any competition. The opposition resulted in a Parliamentary enquiry into the proposals, which generated a disproportionate volume of documentation for such a small scheme. Although Sir John Hanmer had given permission for the railway to pass around the edge of the moss, their consulting engineer, Benjamin Piercy, thought it was a waste of property not to cross the moss. The railway employed Messrs Brun Lees, engineers, to argue their case, who had previously worked on railways in Brazil. The Great Western Railway argued that the moss consisted of of relatively solid crust, under which there were up to of liquid peat, and that the cost of crossing the moss had been underestimated by some £23,000. In reply, the consulting engineer G W Hemans stated that the cost of the whole moss section would be under £3,000, as he had built railways across bogs in Ireland at a cost of less than £800 per mile. He also produced a solid block of peat, to show that it was not a liquid. The Parliamentary committee narrowly found in favour of the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch scheme, although the House of Lords only sanctioned construction of the section from Ellesmere to Whitchurch, including the crossing of Fenn's Moss, and the Oswestry to Ellesmere section was postponed.\n\nWork started on 29 August 1861, with a \"programme of rejoicings\" to celebrate the event. Even the inmates of the Ellesmere workhouse were included, when they were treated to roast beef and plum pudding the following day. The task of crossing Fenn's Moss started in mid-September, and the progress was recorded by the \"Oswestry Advertiser and Montgomeryshire Mercury\" in graphic terms. They reported: \"...our ears are assailed with tidings of the maddest of all mad acts on the part of the maddest of madmen! Messrs Savin and Ward, the contractors, who won't believe they are going to ruin although the Great Western Railway Times has over and over again proved the fact to the satisfaction of all reasonable men, have actually commenced crossing Whixall Moss.\" The contractors cut a series of drains, which allowed the peat to dry and become firmer. After leaving the formation over the winter to settle, heather was spread on the top, followed by a layer of wooden faggots, cut from local woods, and then a thick layer of sand, obtained from banks within the moss. By 27 February 1862, the railway were able to run a locomotive and carriages across the Moss, to help in consolidating the formation, and goods services started on 20 April 1863, with passenger trains following shortly afterwards, on 4 May. In 1864, the company merged with others to form the Cambrian Railways Company, and in 1922, the Cambrian merged with the Great Western Railway, giving them control of the line they had tried so hard to scupper.\n\nThe various enclosures acts, with the consequent removal of common rights and the vesting of control in the landowners, paved the way for subsequent commercial extraction of the peat on the mosses. This began in 1851, when a \"company of gentlemen\", named Vardy & Co., leased from the Hanmer Estate. They intended to erect a works, where useful products would be manufactured from the peat. On 5 May 1856, Joseph Bebb took over the lease, to which was added another , for a period of 21 years. From his Old Moss Works, Bebb built a tramway eastwards to the canal, where there is a raised area of towpath and a simple wharf. No records of levels of production have survived, but on 12 September 1859, the lease was taken over by Richard Henry Holland, and on 3 August 1860 passed to The Moulded Peat Charcoal Company Limited, a company of which Holland was a director. They bought the patent for a machine to turn peat into moulded briquettes, which could be burnt or converted into charcoal or coke. The process was not new to the moss, as records show that moulded peat blocks were being produced as early as 1810. The new company did not last, and ceased trading on 12 December 1864.\n\nBy 1884, George Wardle occupied Fenn's Hall, and started a moss litter business, producing peat for animal bedding. Two years later he was joined in the venture by William Henry Smith, an ironfounder from Whitchurch, and they set up The English Peat Moss Litter Company, which they formally registered on 12 May 1888. They leased land on the north-eastern part of Fenn's Moss from the Hanmer Estate, and in 1889, they obtained rights to the centre of Whixall Moss, by buying the Lordship of the Manor from William Orme Foster. This came with the obligation for maintain the drains, under the terms of the 1823 Enclosure Act, an issue which caused numerous disputes over the years. The company extracted peat from Fenn's Moss, and Wardle and Smith rented out parts of Whixall Moss to local turf cutters. They built the Old Shed Yard Works, a little to the north of the Old Moss Works, and used horse-drawm tramways to transport the finished product away from the works. On the moss, tracks went to the north-west, turned to the south-west and then to the south-east, to reach Oaf's Orchard, on the border between England and Wales. From the works, another tramway headed northwards to Fenn's Bank Brick and Tile Works, where there was an interchange siding with the Cambrian Railway.\nFrom 1889, the English Peat Moss Litter Company started to build houses for its workers, using materials obtained from the Fenn's Bank Brick and Tile Company, and had completed 17 dwellings by 1898. At some point, probably before 1914, William Smith sold his share of the company to George Wardle. Wardle employed around 50 people, but in 1914 there was industrial unrest, including threats to those who chose to keep working, and the works closed intermittently until the dispute was resolved. During World War I, the War Department commandeered much of Fenn's and Whixall Mosses, for use as rifle ranges, but continued to cut peat, which was used for bedding at a cavalry remount station located at Bettisfield Park. It appears that Wardle surrendered his lease to the authorities at this time, and that Tom Allmark, the works foreman, worked for the military, producing peat. They established a peat works, known locally at the Old Graveyard, near to Bettisfield Moss and the railway line. They clearly used tramways, since an auction sale of the works after the war ended included of Decauville railway track and 103 assorted wagons.\n\nIt appears that the Old Graveyard Works was bought by a speculative company called The Bettisfield Trust Company. They obtained a lease from the Hanmer Estate in 1923, allowing them to work for black peat, which was peat at the lower levels of the bog. The Midland Moss Litter Company also obtained a lease for the same area, but they wanted to harvest the upper layers for packing material, cattle feed, and animal bedding. The two companies were required to cooperate under the terms of the lease. William Henry Smith, the former partner of Wardle, was a director of the Bettisfield Trust, but details of exactly what they did are unclear, and they may have established a processing works for making briquettes and distillation of the peat in the Fenn's Bank Brick and Tile Works, rather than at the Old Graveyard site. The enterprise was fairly short lived, as they ceased trading in late 1925.\n\nThe Midland Moss Litter Company established a new works a little further along the railway line, although for a while both works were in operation. They introduced new working practices to the Moss, based on Dutch methods, and rebuilt the Fenn's Old Works in 1938 when the previous one was destroyed by fire. They introduced locomotives to the tramways in 1919, although the peat turves were always cut by hand, and of all the companies operating on the mosses, survived the longest. They continued working on the Moss until August 1962, but almost no documentary evidence for them is known to exist. The company was liquidated during a period when the demand for peat generally was in decline, and the site was bought by L S Beckett. Len Beckett had operated a small peat-cutting business, using Manor House, which his father had bought in 1933, as a base. He died young, and the business was bought by his brother-in-law, Tom Allmark, who could see the potential for peat in horticulture. In 1956 he bought of Whixall Moss from Wardle, bought Manor House in 1957, and soon afterwards, obtained a contract to sell peat to Cuthberts of Llangollen, which was sold as bulb fibre through the retail chain Woolworths. Tom's son Herb Allmark took over running the company in May 1960, and the business expanded when he obtained the Fenn's Old Works and the lease on Fenn's Moss from the Midland Moss Litter Company in 1962.\n\nBeckett's bought the western half of the English part of Bettisfield Moss in 1956 and the Welsh part of it in 1960. The English part was overgrown, but the Welsh part was free of trees, as it had been regularly cleared by burning, and by some domestic peat cutting. They experimented with harvesting the western part of the Welsh Moss commercially in the 1960s, but difficulties with transporting the cut peat to their processing works at Whixall meant that the project was short-lived. Subsequently, pine seedlings colonised the Moss, which Beckett's sold as Christmas trees during the 1960s, but when they stopped doing so, the Moss was rapidly overgrown. The eastern half of the English Moss had been bought by the Darlington family in the late 1800s, and was for a time rented out to Humus Products Ltd, who cut peat.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, all of the peat produced was sold to Woolworths, but the costs ot transport from Fenn's Old Works to Manor House rose, so Allmark extended the tramways on the Moss, and purchased three more secondhand locomotives to supplement the one bought in 1919. He introduced mechanised peat cutters to the Moss in 1968, and in the early 1970s, some of the machinery was moved from Fenn's Old Works to Manor House. When the Hanmer Estate quadrupled the rents in May 1989, L S Beckett sold its operation to Croxden Horticultural Products. L S Beckett had extracted some of peat in the final year of operation, but to make a profit, Croxden's would need to extract much bigger volumes. They rebuilt Manor House Works, and by December 1990 were ready to extract more than double that amount per year. However, the lobby against using peat was growing rapidly, and the Nature Conservancy Council bought the leases, bringing commercial extraction of peat on the Mosses to an end. For many of the men for whom working on the mosses was a way of life, the demise of their industry was greeted with great sadness.\n\nThe tramways on the Mosses were all gauge. The wagons were manufactured locally, and could be used as flat-bed trucks, when transporting peat bales, or could be fitted with slatted wooden sides, when carrying cut peat blocks. The main tracks were fixed to wooden sleepers with flanged iron nails. When dried peat was ready for removal from the Mosses, temporary lines were laid by inserting a point into the main line, and building a siding using rails permanently fixed to metal sleepers. The railway ceased to be used in 1970, after which peat was removed from the moss in trailers towed by Dexta tractors.\n\nFenn's and Whixall Mosses have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1953, and attempts were made to buy the land worked by L S Beckett for nature conservation, but no agreement was reached. When Croxden Horticultural Products took over, there were discussions between them and the Nature Conservancy Council, to see whether some areas of the mosses could be restored. In December 1990, all of their leases and land were bought by the Nature Conservancy Council, and large-scale commercial peat-cutting ended immediately. Local opposition to commercial extraction of peat had been spearheaded by the Fenn's and Whixall Mosses Campaign Group, a grouping of around 20 local organisations, with the Shropshire and North Wales Wildlife Trusts taking the major role. The Nature Conservancy Council obtained the lease for of Fenn's Moss, and bought on Whixall Moss and a further on Bettisfield Moss. Subsequently, the Countryside Council for Wales have obtained leases to another of Fenn's Moss, and English Nature have bought of Whixall Moss.\n\nEnglish Nature were able to employ some of the peat workers, to assist in the regeneration of the mosses, and their specialist knowledge of the network of drains and how to operate machinery on the fragile landscape has proved invaluable. They were also able to buy vehicles from Croxden Horticultural Products, including a 12 tonne Bigtrack bogmaster dumper, a 4 tonne tracked Smalley excavator, a Backer screw-leveller, and two old Dexta tractors with Moss trailers. The mosses contain areas which have never been cut, areas which have been cut by hand, and areas where commercial cutting has taken place. Each presents its own problems, but as a result of the drainage, all are affected by invasive trees and scrub which is normally associated with heath lands, particularly pine trees on Bettisfield Moss and birch scrub elsewhere.\n\nEnglish Nature worked on a management plan for the mosses, which was published in 1993 as the Synopsis Management Plan. It contained eleven objectives, designed to protect the area and ultimately to re-establish it as a raised bog. There has been an extensive programme to clear the birch scrub, which has often been dumped into the drains, to raise water levels, and by mid-1995, dams had been constructed across all of the drains, to retain water on the mosses. Pine trees can be chipped, but birch is more problematic, and where it is extensive, it has been burnt on large metal plates, and the ash removed to prevent enrichment of the peat. Where leakage of water containing high levels of nutrients has occurred, giving rise to alder and willow carr populations, such sources have been traced. The Llangollen Canal was isolated from the mosses by deep piling, carried out by British Waterways in the early 1990s, to prevent leakage from the canal, and a spring on Fenn's Moss, which carried high concentrations of nutrients, has been dammed. The retention of rain water on the mossses has been very successful, and mire vegetation is gradually re-establishing itself.\n\nThe Welsh part and the western half of the English part of Bettisfield Moss was sold to Natural England and Natural Resources Wales in 1990. The eastern part of the English Moss had been bought by a Mr Wilcox in 1978, and was sold to Natural England in 1998. Most of the Moss was a dense pine forest, but Natural England bought the car park at World's End, and this hard area allowed the pine forest to be cleared in 2001, as the wood could be stacked on it until it was transported away. Some oak and birch woodland around the edge of the Moss was kept at the request of local people, for cosmetic reasons. Ditches around the edge of the Moss have been dammed, to encourage the growth of marginal plants, such as purple marsh thistle, yellow great bird's-foot trefoil, meadowsweet and soft rush.\n\nThe importance of the mosses as a scarce habitat has been recognised, and as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve, it is now part of the Midland Meres and Mosses Ramsar site, a designation that recognises internationally important wetlands. Some of the restoration of the mosses has been funded by grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Together with Wem and Cadney Mosses, it is also a European Special Area of Conservation. Among the primary reasons for the designation of the site are the presence of three types of sphagnum, all three British types of sundew, cranberry, bog asphodel, royal fern, white beak-sedge and bog-rosemary. It is one of the few places where the moss Dicranum affine can be found, and provides habitat for over 1,700 species of invertebrates, including 29 which are rare in Britain. Following restoration, the mosses have become wetter, and this has allowed populations of curlews and mallards to expand, while in winter, there are breeding populations of teal and shovellers. The increased numbers of small birds has also resulted in the numbers of predatory peregrine falcons increasing. Raft spiders abound near the peaty pools, and 28 species of dragonfly have been recorded on the mosses.\n\nIn October 2016 Natural England obtained £5 million to allow further regeneration work to be undertaken. The grant will be spread over five years, and will enable Natural England, working with Natural Resources Wales and the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, to buy another of peatland and to raise the water levels over some of the mosses, using new techniques, such as contour bunding, to achieve this. There are also plans to restore other types of habitat around the edges of the mosses, including swamp, fen, and willow and alder carr wet woodland. This will assist populations of willow tit and marsh tit, and encourage the growth of rare bog species such as elongated sedge and several varieties of micro-moths. The money will also fund the diversion of of ditches containing mineral-rich water, and assist in the clean-up of Whixall Moss scrapyard, which was bought by the Shropshire Wildlife Trust as the site for a new visitor centre, but was contaminated with engine oil and 100,000 used vehicle tyres.\n\nIn 2001 a partnership between English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales and British Waterways (since succeeded by Natural England, Natural Resources Wales and the Canal and River Trust respectively), developed circular waymarked trails through some areas of Fenn's and Whixall Mosses.\nWildlife in the nature reserve includes kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby. Plants include cotton sedge, bog moss (\"Sphagnum\"), great hairy willowherb, bog myrtle, water figwort, flag iris, cross-leaved heath, bog rosemary, cranberry and sundew; common alder trees, alder buckthorn, grey sallow and crack willow predominate in wooded fringes, along with some introduced scotch pine.\n\n\n\n"}

She and John Lennon concluded the recording of the song on December 8, 1980. It was upon their return from the recording studio to The Dakota (their home in New York City) that Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman. Lennon was clutching a tape of a final mix when he was shot.\n\nThe song was both a critical and commercial success.\n\nLennon's lead guitar work on the track, which he recorded on 4 December 1980, was his final creative act. He used his famous Beatles era 1958 Rickenbacker 325 to record all the guitar parts. This is the first time that he used the guitar on a studio recording since 1964/65. At the end of January 1981, \"Walking on Thin Ice\" was released as a single and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at number 58 in the US and gaining major club/underground airplay. The single was released in February 1981 in the UK and reached number 35 on the chart. The critical reception was favorable: \"NME\" rated it in the best tracks of year 1981 at number 10. The lyrics talk of the unpredictability of life and death — of \"throwing the dice in the air\" — and reach the conclusion, \"when our hearts return to ashes, it will be just a story...\". On the version included on 1992's \"Onobox\", a new intro was added, where John Lennon can be heard remarking \"I think you just cut your first number one, Yoko.\"\n\nThe B-side, \"It Happened,\" was a slower, mellow track about acceptance - from Ono's vaults that was originally recorded for \"A Story\" and had already seen limited release in Japan as the B-side to \"Yume O Moto\", but was remixed for inclusion on the single. Much like the A-side, the lyrics have a new haunting quality given Lennon's murder: \"It happened at a time of my life/When I least expected... And I know there's no return, no way\". In the essay on the back of the single, Ono talks about how Lennon picked out this track from her old tapes and marked it as a hit. She said \"No way!\" to which he responded \"I'll make it a hit\". He was murdered hours later.\n\nThe song is also included on the experimental compilation album called \"Disco Not Disco\" (2000). In 2003, riding on the success of several Ono club remixes including \"Open Your Box\" and \"Kiss Kiss Kiss\", \"Walking on Thin Ice\" was released as a maxi-single with remixes by dance artists including the Pet Shop Boys, Danny Tenaglia and Felix Da Housecat. It met with incredible success, spending many weeks on the US dance chart before reaching number one, beating Madonna and Justin Timberlake. In the UK, it reached number 35 on the chart, exactly the same position as the original reached in 1981.\n\nElvis Costello and The Attractions (ft. the TKO Horns) recorded a version on the album \"Every Man Has a Woman\" (1984). We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It (aka Fuzzbox) released as at single in 1989, peaked at #76 in the UK charts. The Picketts also recorded a version, (1985) as did Tila Tequila on her EP \"Welcome to the Dark Side\" (2010).\n\nSiouxsie Sioux performed it live with original guitarist Earl Slick and tabla player Talvin Singh, at Ono's Meltdown Festival in London in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoko Ono herself directed a music video for \"Walking on Thin Ice\" which was released in February 1981. In 2003 Mike Mills and Arya Senboutaraj (one half of the directing duo Rainbows & Vampires) directed an animated black and white video featuring the \"Pet Shop Boys Electro Mix Edit\" of the song.\n\n"}

It represents the international artistic style of the royal courts in the court of Louis I of Hungary.\n\nIts full name is: \"Chronicon pictum, Marci de Kalt, Chronica de gestis Hungarorum\", that is \"Illustrated Chronicle, Mark of Kalt's Chronicle About the Deeds of the Hungarians\".\n\nThe chronicle was written by Márk Kálti (lat. \"Marci de Kalt\") shortly after the year 1358, with the last of the illuminations being finished between 1370 and 1373. The chronicle was given by the Hungarian king Louis I to the French king Charles V, when the daughter of Louis, Catherine, was engaged to Charles's son Louis I, Duke of Orléans.\n\nThe chronicle was then given to Đorđe Branković in 1456, where it was copied, and later lost, possibly spending some time in Turkish possession.\n\nThe chronicle reappears in the first half of the 17th century in royal archives of Vienna by unknown means, which is why it is also referred as the \"Vienna Illuminated Chronicle\". The manuscript is now kept in the National Széchényi Library in Budapest (Országos Széchényi Könyvtár, Budapest).\n\nThe 147 pictures of the chronicle are great sources of information on medieval Hungarian cultural history, costume, and court life in the 14th century. Many miniatures seen inside this chronicle are painted with gold. The artistic value of the miniatures are quite high, if we compare similar miniatures from other parts of Western Europe from the same time. The characters are drawn with detail and with knowledge of anatomy; for example, even the eyeballs are painted, a fact which can only be ascertained by using a microscope on the miniature.\n\nAll miniatures showing Attila the Hun are disrupted or even rubbed out (especially the last miniature depicting Attila's death); this cannot be due to the time as all other miniatures and text are preserved well. The miniatures make use of symbolism, i.e. \"primus ingressus\" ('first incoming') is with a camel, while the \"secundus ingressus\" ('second incoming') is with a white horse, probably meaning that entering the Carpathian Basin the first time was not a successful or was a culturally diverted act (as the camel is a \"diverted\" horse and white horse is the \"pure quality\"). The text of Latin is without error and is representing a high quality.\n\n"}

{"id": "1971484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971484", "title": "Sudeten Germans", "text": "Sudeten Germans\n\nGerman Bohemians (, i.e. German Bohemians and German Moravians), later known as Sudeten Germans, were ethnic Germans living in the Czech lands of the Bohemian Crown, which later became an integral part of Czechoslovakia in which before 1945 over three million German Bohemians inhabited, about 23 percent of the population of the whole country and about 29.5 percent of the population of Bohemia and Moravia. Ethnic Germans migrated into the Kingdom of Bohemia, an electoral territory of the Holy Roman Empire, from the 11th century, mostly in the border regions of what was later called the \"Sudetenland\", which was named after the Sudeten Mountains. The process of German expansion was known as \"Ostsiedlung\" (\"Settling of the East\"). The name \"Sudeten Germans\" was adopted during rising nationalism after the fall of Austria-Hungary after the First World War. After the Munich Agreement, the so-called Sudetenland became part of Germany.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the remainder of the German-speaking population, mostly Roman Catholic and only few Protestants, prevailingly from Czech Silesia, was expelled from Czechoslovakia to Germany and Austria.\n\nThe area that became known as the Sudetenland possessed chemical works and lignite mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. The Bohemian border with Bavaria was inhabited primarily by Germans. The Upper Palatine Forest, which extends along the Bavarian frontier and into the agricultural areas of southern Bohemia, was an area of German settlement. Moravia contained patches of \"locked\" German territory to the north and south. More characteristic were the German language islands, which were towns inhabited by German minorities and surrounded by Czechs. Sudeten Germans were mostly Roman Catholics, a legacy of centuries of Austrian Habsburg rule.\n\nNot all ethnic Germans lived in isolated and well-defined areas; for historical reasons, Czechs and Germans mixed in many places, and Czech-German bilingualism was quite common. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 19th century, Czechs and Germans began to create separate cultural, educational, political and economic institutions, which kept both groups semiisolated from each other. That form of separation continued until the end of the Second World War, when almost all Germans were expelled.\n\nIn the English language, ethnic Germans who originated in the Kingdom of Bohemia were traditionally referred to as \"German Bohemians\". This appellation utilizes the broad definition of Bohemia, which includes all of the three Bohemian crown lands: Bohemia, Moravia and (Austrian) Silesia. In the German language, it is more common to distinguish among the three lands, hence the prominent terms \"Deutschböhmen\" (German Bohemians), \"Deutschmährer\" (German Moravians) and \"Deutschschlesier\" (German Silesians). Even in German, however, the broader use of \"Bohemian\" is also found.\n\nThe term \"Sudeten Germans\" (\"Sudetendeutsche\") came about during rising ethnic nationalism in the early 20th century, after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the First World War. It coincided with the rise of another new term, \"the Sudetenland\", which referred only to the parts of the former Kingdom of Bohemia that were inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans. These names were derived from the Sudeten Mountains, which form the northern border of the Bohemian lands. As these terms were heavily used by the Nazi German regime to push forward the creation of a Greater Germanic Reich, many contemporary Germans avoid them in favour of the traditional names.\n\nThere have been ethnic Germans living in the Bohemian crown lands since the Middle Ages. In the late 12th and in the 13th century the Přemyslid rulers promoted the colonisation of certain areas of their lands by German settlers from the adjacent lands of Bavaria, Franconia, Upper Saxony and Austria during the \"Ostsiedlung\" migration.\n\nIn 1348, the Luxembourg king Charles I, also King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor (as Charles IV) from 1355, founded the Charles University in Prague (\"Alma Mater Carolina\"), the first in Central Europe, attended by large German student nations, and its language of education was Latin. Czechs made up about 20 percent of the students at the time of its founding, and the rest was primarily German. A culturally-significant example of German Bohemian prose from the Middle Ages is the story \"Der Ackermann aus Böhmen\" (\"The Ploughman from Bohemia\"), written in Early New High German by Johannes von Tepl (c. 1350 – 1414) in Žatec (\"Saaz\"), who probably had studied liberal arts in Prague.\n\nFor centuries, German Bohemians played important roles in the economy and politics of the Bohemian lands. For example, forest glass production was a common industry for German Bohemians. Though they were living beyond the medieval Kingdom of Germany, an independent German Bohemian awareness, however, was not widespread, and for a long time, it played no decisive role in everyday life. Individuals were usually seen as Bohemians, Moravians or Silesians. Defining events later in German Bohemian history were the Hussite Wars, the occupation of Bohemia by the Czech Brethren, the Thirty Years' War, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were severely affected, which caused the immigration of further German settlers.\n\nAfter the death of King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia in the 1526 Battle of Mohács, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria became King of Bohemia, which became a constituent state of the Habsburg Monarchy. With the rise of the Habsburgs in Bohemia after the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the old Bohemian nobility became virtually meaningless. Increasingly, the Bohemian crown lands were ruled from the Austrian capital, Vienna, which favoured the dominance of the German language and German culture. On the other hand, the 18th-century Silesian Wars started by Prussian King Frederick II of Prussia against Austria resulted in the loss of the traditionally-Bohemian crown land and weakened Germans in the remaining parts of Bohemia. As the 19th century arrived, resistance to the German domination began to develop among the Czechs.\n\nAfter the revolutions of 1848 and the rise of ethnic nationalism, nervousness about ethnic tensions in Austria-Hungary resulted in a prevailing equality between Czechs and German Bohemians. Each ethnicity tried to retain, in regions in which it was the majority, sovereignty over its own affairs. Czechs and Germans generally maintained separate schools, churches and public institutions. Nevertheless, despite the separation, Germans often undersood some Czech, and Czechs often spoke some German. Cities like Prague, however, saw more mixing between the ethnicities and also had large populations of Jews. Jews in Bohemia often spoke German and sometimes Yiddish. The famed writer Franz Kafka exemplifies the diversity of Bohemia since he was a German-speaking Prague-based Jew, but his surname was of Czech origin.\n\nIn 1867, the equality of Austrian citizens of all ethnicities was guaranteed by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which enshrined the principles of constitutional monarchy. The agreement established the Dual Monarchy and gave the Hungarians sovereignty over their own affairs. The preservation of German cultural dominance throughout Cisleithania had proved to be difficult and now seemed to be was utterly impossible.\n\nWith the agreement, the desire for an autonomous Czech subdivision was mounting. Both German Bohemians and Czechs were hoping for a constitutional solution to the demands, but Czech nationalist views remained a constant part of the Bohemian political sphere. The Czechs had feared Germanization, but the Germans now worried about Czechization.\n\nA symbol of the rising tensions was the fate of Charles University, then called Charles-Ferdinand University. Its Czech students had become increasingly perturbed by the sole use of German for instruction. During the 1848 revolution, both Germans and Czechs fought to make Czech one of the university's official languages. They achieved that right, and the university became bilingual. By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent colleges, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university. After long negotiations, it was divided into the German Charles-Ferdinand University and the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University. The Cisleithanian Imperial Council prepared an act of parliament, and the emperor granted royal assent on 28 February 1882.\n\nIn 1907, the Cisleithanian Imperial Council was for the first time elected by universal male suffrage. As part of the process, new constituency boundaries had to be drawn throughout the empire. Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand came up with a plan, known as the United States of Greater Austria, in 1909. German Bohemia, as it was to be called, was going to be separated from the Czech areas around it in the plan. That would create ethnically-homogenous self-governing provinces that would hopefully end the ethnic conflict. However, Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, and the First World War destroyed all hopes for a redrawn Cisleithania.\n\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought about the partition of the multiethnic Austria-Hungary into its historical components, one of them, the Bohemian Kingdom, forming the west of the newly-created Czechoslovakia. Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the Bohemian Crown according to the principle of \"uti possidetis juris\". The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of government, Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg, wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (\"Verwaltungskreisen\"), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, Max Hussarek von Heinlein, offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the United States in the war as an associate power of the Triple Entente. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.\n\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, in uniting all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the Province of German Bohemia was formed with its capital in Reichenberg. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia stretching from the Egerland to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire. In South Bohemia the administrative unit of Böhmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of Upper Austria. German Bohemia in the Eagle Mountains and in the area of Landskron merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of Neubistritz was incorporated into Znaim and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and Vienna was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of German Austria. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (\"Provisorische Nationalversammlung\"), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former Cisleithanian Imperial Council.\n\nIn addition to the establishment of the state's governmental organisation, higher authorities were also created, such as the Finance Ministry, the Department of Agriculture and the Higher Regional Court of Reichenberg as well as a general post office and railway administration.\n\nFor geographical reasons, however, a territorial solution would have been impossible unless those regions, together with Austria, had been annexed to Germany.\n\nAfter the Czechoslovak Republic was proclaimed on 28 October 1918, the German Bohemians, claiming the right to self-determination according to the tenth of US President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, demanded that their homeland areas remain with Austria, which by then had been reduced to the Republic of German Austria. The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination. The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic, then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.\n\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new Austrian Republic. Instead, it would become part of Czechoslovakia. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an ethnic minority. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6 million Czechs, 3.2 million Germans, two million Slovaks, 0.7 million Hungarians, half a million Ruthenians (Rusyns), 300,000 Jews, and 100,000 Poles, as well as Gypsies, Croats and other ethnic groups. German-speakers represented a third of the population of the Bohemian lands and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6 million).\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and lignite mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding Eger was the most active area for pan-German nationalism. \nThe Upper Palatinate Forest, an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern Bohemia.\n\nMoravia contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs. Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern Silesia, which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the Weimar Republic.\n\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfil what the Czechs had promised in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister (Robert Mayr-Harting and Franz Spina), and the first German political party became part of the government (German Christian Social People's Party and Farmers' League).\n\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation, and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor Gustav Stresemann, adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\nAt a party conference in Teplitz in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the \"Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei\" (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, Ludwig Czech became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by Wenzel Jaksch.\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with Hans Schütz of the German Christian Social People's Party (\"Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei\") and Gustav Hacker of the Farmers' Association (\"Bund der Landwirte\", formed the \"Jungaktivisten\" (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia. At simultaneous mass rallies in Tetschen-Bodenbach/Děčín, Saaz/Žatec and Olešnice v Orlických horách/Gießhübl im Adlergebirge on April 26, 1936, they demanded equal opportunities in civil service for Germans, financial assistance for German businesses, official acceptance of the German language for public servants in the Sudetenland and measures to reduce unemployment in the Sudetenland. (At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of Beneš decrees.\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the German National Socialist Workers' Party, remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older \"Deutsche Turnverband\" and \"Schutzvereine\", the \"Kameradschaftsbund\", the Nazi \"Volkssport\" (1929) and the \"Bereitschaft\".\n\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like Egerland.\n\nOn 1 October 1933, Konrad Henlein with his deputy, Karl Hermann Frank, aided by other members of the \"Kameradschaftsbund\", a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The Sudeten German Home Front (\"Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront\") professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the Sudeten German Party (\"Sudetendeutsche Partei\") (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy. Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with Nazi Germany and received material aid from Berlin, which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a \"Führer\" and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected. By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the Third Reich annexed Austria during the \"Anschluss\". Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by Gustav Hacker, merged with the SdP. German Christian Socialists in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club. Although the Social Democrats continued to champion democratic freedoms, the masses supported the SdP.\n\nThe table below shows the number of seats German parties and German–Hungarian lists gained in the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies between 1920 and 1935.\n\nKonrad Henlein met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938 and was told to raise demands that would be unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the \"Sudetendeutsche Freikorps\" (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to Nazi Germany.\n\nIn August, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sent Lord Runciman, a faithful appeaser, to Czechoslovakia to see if he could obtain a settlement between the Czechoslovak government and the Sudeten Germans. His mission failed because Heinlein refused all conciliating proposals under secret orders by Hitler.\n\nThe Runciman Report to the British government stated this on Czechoslovakia's policy towards the German minority during the preceding decades:\n\nCzech officials and Czech police, speaking little or no German, were appointed in large numbers to purely German districts; Czech agricultural colonists were encouraged to settle on land confiscated under the Land Reform in the middle of German populations; for the children of these Czech invaders Czech schools were built on a large scale; there is a very general belief that Czech firms were favoured as against German firms in the allocation of State contracts and that the State provided work and relief for Czechs more readily than for Germans. I believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September. The Munich Agreement, signed September 29 by Britain, France, Germany and Italy and negotiated without Czechoslovak participation, only confirmed that decision and the negotiated details. Czechoslovakia ceded a German-defined maximalist extension of Sudetenland to Germany, including the Škoda Works; near Pilsen, they had been Czechoslovakia's primary armaments factory.\n\nAs a result, Bohemia and Moravia lost about 38 percent of their combined area, and 3.65 million inhabitants (2.82 million Germans and approximately 513,000 - 750,000 Czechs to Germany).\n\nSome 250,000 Germans remained on the Czech side of the border, which later became part of the Reich by the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia under German governors and the German Army. Almost all the Germans in these Czech territories were subsequently granted German citizenship, while most of the Germans in Slovakia obtained citizenship of the Slovak state.\n\nWith the establishment of German rule, hundreds of thousands of Czechs who (under the policy of Czechification) had moved into the Sudetenland after 1919 left the area, some willingly. They were, however, permitted to take away their possessions and to legally sell their houses and land. A few, however, remained.\n\nIn elections held on 4 December 1938, 97.32% of the adult population in Sudetenland voted for the NSDAP (most of the rest were Czechs who were allowed to vote as well). About half a million Sudeten Germans joined the Nazi Party, which amounted to 17.34% of the German population in the Sudetenland (the average in Nazi Germany was 7.85%). Because of their knowledge of the Czech language, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as well as in the Nazi oppressive machinery such as the Gestapo. The most notable was Karl Hermann Frank, the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, almost all Czechoslovak Jews, most of whom were primarily German-speaking were deported and murdered the authorities.\n\nDuring World War II, German men in Slovakia usually served in the Slovak army, but more than 7,000 were members of paramilitary squads (\"Freiwillige Schutzstaffeln\") and almost 2,000 volunteers joined the \"Waffen-SS\". After the beginning of the Slovak National uprising in late 1944, most of the young Germans in Slovakia were drafted in the German army, either with the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS. The very young and elderly were organized in \"Heimatschutz\", an equivalent of the \"Volkssturm\" in Germany. The Nazis ordered some of them to take action against the partisans; others participated in deportation of Slovak Jews. The Nazis evacuated about 120,000 Germans (mostly women and children) to the Sudetenland and the Protectorate.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, when the Czechoslovak state was restored, the government expelled the majority of ethnic Germans (about 3 million altogether), in the belief that their behaviour had been a major cause of the war and subsequent destruction. In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches. Generally local authorities ordered the expulsions, which armed volunteers carried out. In some cases the regular army initiated or assisted such expulsions. Several thousand Germans were murdered during the expulsion, and many more died from hunger and illness as a consequence of becoming refugees.\n\nThe regular transfer of ethnic nationals among nations, authorized according to the Potsdam Conference, proceeded from 25 January 1946 until October 1946. An estimated 1.6 million \"ethnic Germans\" (most of them also had Czech ancestors; and even Czechs, who spoke mainly German over the last years), were deported from Czechoslovakia to the American zone of what would become West Germany. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the Soviet zone (in what would become East Germany). Estimates of casualties related to this expulsion range between 20,000 and 200,000 people, depending on source. Casualties included primarily violent deaths and suicides, rapes, deaths in internment camps and natural causes.\n\nEven the German-speaking Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague could not escape expulsion. The remaining faculty, students, and administrators fled to Munich in Bavaria, where they established the Collegium Carolinum, a research institute for the study of the Bohemian lands.\n\nThe \"Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft\" claims to represent the German refugees from the former Czechoslovak Republic, but its conservative positions were and are discussed very controversially among the refugees themselves, with many choosing not to associate with the organization. In the 2001 census, 39,106 people in the Czech Republic claimed German ethnicity. In theory, with the accession of the Czech Republic into the European Union, refugee Sudeten Germans and their descendants (or for that matter, also Germans with no previous link to the Bohemian lands) could have moved back there without needing the Czech government's permission - but in practice such a move did not materialize in any significant numbers, as they could not reclaim property and many were well established in Germany.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1986, a task force under the leadership of Sally Ride was asked to formulate a new strategy for NASA. The report was issued in 1987.\n\nThe Ride Report proposed four main initiatives for study and evaluation. These were:\n\n\"Mission to Planet Earth\" would be centred on the observation of our home planet. New technologies for observation would be needed, and launch capabilities for geostationary and polar orbits. The space station that was under planning at the time this report was issued, is called simply \"the Space Station\" and is more ambitious than the current ISS, in that it would be well-developed enough to have ability for assembly of satellites and platforms in orbit. A transfer vehicle to launch these into geostationary orbit is proposed as well.\n\nIn the section \"Exploration of the Solar System\", the report points out that there are too few planetary exploration missions planned. It proposes some new missions, such as a cometary mission, an extended Cassini mission (including three probes; one for the study of the atmosphere of Saturn, one atmospheric Titan probe and one to land on Titan) and a Mars sample return mission.\n\nA permanent lunar outpost is discussed in \"Outpost on the Moon\". This goal would be reached through three phases, where the first would deal with robotic exploration during the 1990s to find a suitable site. In the second phase, astronauts would be launched to the Moon on a Lunar transfer vehicle from the Space Station. They would bring scientific instruments and equipment and modules for the outpost. In the third phase, the outpost would be a permanent installation, with closed-loop life-support systems, and great abilities for exploration of the Moon. According to the plan, there would be a crew of 30 living and working on the Moon by 2010.\n\nIn \"Humans to Mars\" the ambitious goal of manned Mars landings is proposed to happen as soon as 2010. Preparations for these missions include robotic exploration of Mars, with orbiters, rovers and sample return missions. The Space Station was to be used for study of the human body during long space flights. The construction of an outpost on Mars could begin during the 2020s.\n\nThe Ride Report also recognizes the risks of making the Space Station dependent on one single launch vehicle - the Space Shuttle. It proposes the development of a shuttle-derived cargo launcher, as a way of diversifying the launch fleet.\n\n\n"}

The album's cover nicknamed Shatner \"Captain Kirk of Star Trek\" most likely to boost sales and appeal to fans of the show. The concept of the album was to juxtapose famous pieces of poetry with their modern counterparts, pop lyrics. The album is best remembered for showcasing Shatner's now-famous vocal style—spoken word with dramatic pauses and flourishes. In the decades since its release, most of the album's tracks have been used satirically, either on compilation albums meant to showcase bad celebrity singing (the Rhino Records \"Golden Throats\" series) or by radio disc jockeys looking for laughs. On the other hand, many praise the album in the genre of spoken-word music.\n\nIn a retrospective review in 2011, Greg Prato of music database website AllMusic rated \"The Transformed Man\" four-and-a-half out of a possible five stars, although with serious reservations. He stated that when listening to the album, \"it's unclear if Shatner is merely having a good time and goofing around, or if he's embarrassingly dead serious, and creating an overly indulgent work.

He lived in Southampton until the age of 26 before relocating to Manchester, England, U.K. where he had a studio and ran a night club and record label, both called Garuda. He has a degree in Politics from University of Warwick and is trained in classical piano. Prior to becoming involved in electronic music he played guitar in a punk band in the mid-nineties. He now lives in Los Angeles with his wife Kat and two daughters.\n\nEmery's production style is influenced by various genres of electronic dance music.\n\nEmery's debut vinyl release was a white label remix of The Shrink's \"Nervous Breakdown\" which was released in early 2002. However, the track that launched his career is generally considered to be his third release: GTR – \"Mistral\". It was created entirely on a computer over the course of a two-week holiday in Provence. Paul van Dyk debuted the track live on the radio during the Nature One Festival in 2002 and it subsequently received support from some of the world's leading DJs, including Tiësto, Armin van Buuren and Ferry Corsten.\n\nEmery was ranked at #34 in DJ Mag's Top 100 poll in 2006, #31 in 2007, #23 in 2008, #9 in 2009 and #7 in 2010.

Those votes, and the amazing support you've shown over the last year, is what matters to me.\"This move was covered by many dance music blogs.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2008, Gareth co-owned now defunct label Five AM under which some of his biggest hits from the time were released (Mistral / This Is That / More Than Anything). In late 2008 he left Five AM and started a new label called Garuda. The first Garuda release was his own record \"Exposure / Metropolis\" released in May 2009.\n\nSince then all Emery's records have been released through Garuda. It is named after the bird-like creature from Hindu and Buddhist mythology, which Emery became aware of whilst touring Indonesia. The label has released records by artists including Ben Gold, Tritonal, M.I.K.E. and Blake Jarrell. The label also runs occasional club nights. Guests have included Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz, Above & Beyond (band) and Sander Van Doorn.\n\nSince March 2006, Emery has produced the 'Gareth Emery Podcast'. It has been nominated for \"Best Podcast\" at the Miami Winter Music Conference's International Dance Music Awards three times. In July 2012, Emery launched a syndicated radio show in North America called 'Gareth Emery Presents' on the SiriusXM channel Electric Area (Channel 52). The show is broadcast at 5pm ET Fridays with a repeat at 8pm ET Tuesdays.\n\nIn November 2014, Emery announced that Episode 310 would be the final episode of the \"Gareth Emery Podcast\". He explained on social media:\n\n\"After doing the show more or less every week since 2006 I guess I'd become a bit too comfortable, and I sometimes felt like I was producing the show on auto pilot for the last year or so. Saying the same old **** and playing the same sounding music, and probably playing it a bit too safe, choosing the obvious bangers and hot promos rather than pushing myself to dig out those hidden gems like I always used to.\"\n\nEmery then followed up with an announcement of a new podcast from his new SiriusXM show called \"ELECTRIC FOR LIFE\" In May 2015, Gareth Emery partnered with Electronic Music lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which the proceeds are donated to his charitable foundation, Electric For Life.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, Emery released single \"CVNT5\" together with Ashley Wallbridge. The \"CVNT5\" music video is a satirical view on careers of popular electronic dance music acts. The video featured two aspiring DJs played by Emery and Wallbridge who hoped to appear on the Forbes Highest-Paid DJs list. They climbed to international stardom by hiring a ghost-producer to create their songs and buying many Twitter followers, while dressing in ludicrous clothing and wigs. The song later appeared on Emery's third studio album \"100 Reasons to Live\". They released a second single on 19 March 2016 titled \"They Don't Want Us To Win\", which featured a sample from DJ Khaled saying \"win\" in the song's buildup. Wallbridge revealed that the project came to light during a drunken conversation in a pub, which purpose was to \"have a laugh\" and satirise the clichés in dance culture.\n\nThe duo released a follow-up video through YouTube titled \"DJ Mag Corruption Exposed: A CVNT5 Documentary\" on 14 October 2016. The mockumentary showed CVNT5 continuing their attempt to reach number one on DJ Mag's annual Top 100 DJs list, notably by investing $50,000 into advertising, paying a black market Vietnamese click farm to generate votes, and bribing key figures in DJ Mag. CVNT5 ended up winning number two on the rankings albeit their efforts, likely due to another individual paying the magazine's Editor In Chief with a diamond-encrusted watch. Critics felt that the video served as criticism to DJ Mag's list; referring to the time in 2015 where DJs Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike won first place under suspicious circumstances, specifically by vote buying and having staff members walk around with iPads at their performing venues to secure extra votes.\n\nOn 18 June 2018, American video streaming service go90 announced eight episodes of \"We Are CVNT5\", which will expand on the original CVNT5 mockumentary. The series was directed by Matt Enlow, written by Emery, Alex Madden and Geraint Jones, and featured Paul Holowaty, Taylor Misiak, Dillon Francis, and Pete Tong. The series was based heavily on Emery's musical experience during the United States' electronic dance music boom. A trailer for the series was released on 25 June 2018. Emery revealed through Facebook that the project encountered many issues during its production, including \"tears\", \"screaming\", and lawsuits, but managed to complete it in time. All eight episodes of \"We Are CVNT5\" were made available on 28 June 2018.\n\nElectric For Life is Gareth's new brand which replaced the eight year old Gareth Emery Podcast in November 2014. It is a radio show, live show, and charitable foundation.\n\nAll proceeds from the Electric For a Life Foundation shows are donated to help vulnerable groups in society. The first show was a fundraiser for the Greater Vancouver Food Bank which raised $15,000.\n\nOn 28 November 2015, Gareth hosted Electric For Life Day: a 24-hour live broadcast involving Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, W&W, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Aly & Fila, Dash Berlin, Cosmic Gate and Seven Lions. During the show he hosted an Electric For Life stage at the Stereosonic festival in Sydney which featured performances of Andrew Rayel, MaRLo, Emma Hewitt, and Mark Sherry alongside Emery himself.\n\nGareth Emery's production aliases include GTR, Cupa, Digital Blues and a house project under the name Runaway. His production history includes collaborations with artists like Lange, Solid Globe, Jon O’Bir and CERN with releases on a multitude of labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1971520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971520", "title": "Mitchell (film)", "text": "Mitchell (film)\n\nMitchell is a 1975 American action film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, written by Ian Kennedy Martin, and starring Joe Don Baker as an abrasive police detective. The film was released in the United States on September 10, 1975 by Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.\n\nVery much an anti-hero, Mitchell often ignores the orders of his superiors and demonstrates disdain for by-the-book development work as well as normal social graces. The film co-stars John Saxon and Martin Balsam as the banking criminals Mitchell pursues and Linda Evans and Merlin Olsen in supporting roles as a prostitute and henchman.\n\nThe film had a resurgence after being featured in a season 5 episode of the comedy series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" in 1993.\n\nA trade union lawyer named Walter Deaney (John Saxon) kills a burglar in his house. Only an unorthodox plainclothes detective named Mitchell (Joe Don Baker) believes that Deaney is guilty of something more than self-defense, but Chief of Police Albert Pallin (Robert Phillips) tells him that Deaney is wanted for \"every federal law violation in the book\" and is therefore \"FBI property.\"\n\nTo keep Mitchell away from Deaney, the Chief orders him to stake out the home of James Arthur Cummins (Martin Balsam), a wealthy man with ties to the mob whose \"big scene\" is the import and export of stolen merchandise. Mitchell initially is unconcerned with Cummins and focuses primarily on Deaney. But he gets drawn in after Cummins discovers that Salvatore Mistretta (Morgan Paull), cousin of his \"mafioso\" benefactor Tony Gallano (Harold J. Stone), is bringing in a shipment of stolen heroin from Mexico without Cummins' approval.\n\nMeanwhile, a high-priced escort named Greta (Linda Evans) shows up at Mitchell's apartment. Mitchell allows her to come in, and after spending two nights with her and arresting her for possession of marijuana, he discovers that Deaney is paying her $1,000 per night to entertain Mitchell. After unsuccessfully trying to bribe Mitchell with Greta's services and an offer of an illicit real estate deal, Deaney decides to work with Cummins to eliminate the annoying cop. Deaney is killed shortly thereafter during an attempt on Mitchell's life.\n\nCummins refuses to let Mistretta use his port facilities to bring in the shipment, causing Gallano to send thugs to harass him. Cummins decides that the only ally he still has—aside from his faithful butler and bodyguard, Benton (Merlin Olsen)—is Mitchell, because he's no good to the police dead. In exchange for his own freedom, Cummins offers to allow Mitchell to pose as a chauffeur and pick up the shipment, putting him in a position to both confiscate the drugs and arrest Mistretta. However, Cummins double-crosses Mitchell by alerting Mistretta to his real identity. He also double-crosses Mistretta by replacing the heroin with chalk. Mistretta decides to kill Mitchell and dump the body on Cummins' boat.\n\nMistretta is killed in the subsequent gun battle, allowing Mitchell to go after Cummins, who is attempting to flee the country by sea. Mitchell is dropped onto the boat by helicopter and kills Benton with a gaff hook. Cummins is killed by a close-range shot from an assault rifle after one final attempted double-cross fails, bringing the central plot to a close.\n\nMitchell returns to his apartment to find Greta awaiting him. Mitchell brushes her off, pointing out that she is no longer being paid to keep him company. Despite this, Greta wishes to spend the night with Mitchell. However, he detects the scent of marijuana on her and the film concludes on what is intended to be a humorous beat, as Mitchell prepares to haul Greta off to jail for a second possession charge.\n\nIn 1980, a heavily edited version of the 1975 film was released for broadcast television, in which most of the violence and all of the nudity and profanity were removed. Several scenes in the film were shot twice for this purpose.\n\n\n\"Mitchell\" was generally panned by critics upon its release. In \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby wrote:\n\n\"Mitchell\", starring Joe Don Baker as a hard-nosed Los Angeles detective named Mitchell, has a lot of over-explicit violence, some gratuitous sex stuff and some rough language, yet it looks like a movie that couldn't wait to get to prime-time television. Perhaps it's a pilot film for a TV series, or maybe it's just a movie that's bad in a style we associate with some of the more mindless small-screen entertainments.\n\nMitchell spends what seems to be the greater part of the film climbing in and out of automobiles, driving automobiles, chasing other automobiles, parking automobiles, and leaning against the body of automobiles that are temporarily at rest. Once he smashes a hoodlum's hand in the door of an automobile.\n\nThe climax, for a giddy change of pace, features a police helicopter in pursuit of a high-speed cabin cruiser. Automobiles sink when driven onto water.\n\nSaid the \"Time Out\" film guide:\n\nBaker's the big lumpy cop who won't take no and another assignment for an answer when he's told to lay off the gun-happy lawyer (Saxon) he suspects of cold-blooded murder, and to concentrate on the businessman with the coke connection (Balsam). He realises that in such a sparsely-populated cheapie they just have to be in collusion, as he punches and shoots his way to the final credits accompanied by vocal encouragement from one of those country singers with terminal cancer. Balsam and Saxon contribute no more than their required quota of urbane sneers before being bulldozed into oblivion by the golem hero of this irredeemably routine potboiler.\n\nThe Internet Movie Database currently gives \"Mitchell\" a user ranking of 2.3 out of 10, while the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" version holds a much more favorable ranking of 9.0 out of 10.\n\nOn October 23, 1993, the edited-for-television release of \"Mitchell\" was featured as an episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". The film was trimmed by several minutes to match \"MST3K\"'s format. This resulted in John Saxon's character, killed by Mitchell in a deleted scene, simply vanishing from the action. The only mention of his disappearance was a voiceover by a radio announcer stating that Saxon's character had died. Tom Servo remarks on this lapse with the question, \"Hey, guys, wasn't John Saxon in this movie?\" Particularly mocked were Mitchell's alcoholism, slovenliness and uncouth behavior. During the opening credits, Servo and Crow mock the theme song by improvising lyrics about food and Mitchell's weight, briefly referencing the theme song from \"Shaft\".\n\nAccording to page 97 of the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide\", the cast had heard a rumor that actor Joe Don Baker was very angry at the \"MST3K\" treatment of \"Mitchell\", and threatened physical violence on any of the cast or crew, should he ever meet them in person. This did not stop them from later featuring (and happily mocking) another of Baker's films, \"Final Justice\", and hurling even more vicious insults at Baker. Kevin Murphy, who played \"MST3K\"'s robot commentator Tom Servo, as well as serving as one of the show's writers, later said Baker likely meant it in a joking manner. Nevertheless, \"MST3K\" head writer and star Michael J. Nelson stated that he avoided running into Baker when he discovered that they were both staying at the same hotel.\n\nThe episode is also notable for its host segment's subplot involving Gypsy, who overhears the Mads plotting to kill their new temp, Mike, and mistakenly thinks they are planning to kill Joel. Working with Mike, Gypsy locates an escape pod and uses it to \"save\" Joel's life, ending his imprisonment on the Satellite of Love. The Mads then abandon their plan to fire Mike, and instead send him to the SoL to replace Joel.\n\nThe episode was chosen by fans to appear in the \"MST3K\" 2016 Turkey Day Marathon. The episode finished third in a poll of \"MST3K\" Season 11 Kickstarter backers. Writer Jim Vorel ranked the episode the eighth best in his rankings of the show's first 11 seasons (191 episodes), and Season 11 head writer Elliott Kalan selected \"Mitchell\" as his ninth-favorite \"MST3K\" episode.\n\nThe \"MST3K\" version of the film was released on VHS by Rhino Home Video on September 1, 1998 and was reissued on DVD in November 2001 with the theatrical trailer as an extra. On November 26, 2013, Shout! Factory re-released the \"MST3K\" version of the film as a bonus feature on their \"25th Anniversary Edition\" DVD boxed set.\n\nThe film's theme song, \"Mitchell,\" was performed by country music singer Hoyt Axton.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971521", "title": "Samuel of Nehardea", "text": "Samuel of Nehardea\n\nSamuel of Nehardea or Samuel bar Abba, often simply called Samuel (Hebrew: שמואל) and occasionally Mar Samuel, was a Jewish Amora of the first generation; son of Abba bar Abba and head of the Yeshiva at Nehardea, Babylonia. He was a teacher of halakha, judge, physician, and astronomer. He was born about 165 CE at Nehardea, and died there in 254 CE. In the Talmud, Samuel is frequently associated with Abba Arikha (\"Rav\"), with whom he debated on many issues.\n\nAs in the case of many other great men, a number of legendary stories are connected with his birth.\n\nHis father, Abba bar Abba, subsequently known also by the Aramaic language designation Abuh di-Shemu'el (\"father of Samuel\"), was a silk-merchant. R. Judah ben Bathyra ordered a silken garment from him, but refused to take it after Abba had procured it, and when the latter asked him the reason of his refusal, R. Judah answered, \"The commission was only a spoken word, and was not sufficient to make the transaction binding.\" Abba thereupon said, \"Is the word of a sage not a better guarantee than his money?\" \"You are right,\" said R. Judah; \"and because you lay so much stress upon a given word you shall have the good fortune of having a son who shall be like the prophet Samuel, and whose word all Israel will recognize as true.\" Soon afterward a son was born to Abba, whom he named Samuel.\n\nEven as a boy Samuel displayed rare ability. His first teacher was an otherwise unknown man, and Samuel, who knew more about a certain legal question than did his teacher, would not submit to ill treatment by him. Then Samuel's father, who was himself a prominent teacher of the Law, recognized as such even by Rav, undertook to instruct the boy. As he seems to have been unequal to this task he sent him to Nisibis to attend the school of the rabbi who had predicted the boy's birth, that he might there acquire a knowledge of the Law. Samuel seems to have remained only a short time at Nisibis. On his return to Nehardea he studied under Levi ben Sisi, who was in Babylonia before the death of Judah ha-Nasi, and who exerted a great influence on Samuel's development. Samuel made such rapid progress and became so proficient in his studies that he soon associated as an equal with his teacher.\n\nApart from the Bible and the traditional Law, which were usually the only subjects of study of the Jewish youth of that time, Samuel was instructed, probably in his early youth, in other sciences. It is likely that he accompanied his father on the latter's journey to Palestine; for after his teacher Levi ben Sisi had gone to Palestine there was no one in Babylon with whom he could have studied. According to an account in the Talmud, Samuel is said to have cured R. Judah haNasi of an eye disease. Although Samuel was at that time too young to study directly under R. Judah, he studied under the pupils of the patriarch, especially with Hanina bar Hama.\n\nAfter having acquired a great store of knowledge in the Land of Israel, his studies there including the Mishnah edited by R. Judah haNasi as well as the other collections of tradition, Samuel left the Holy Land, probably with his father, and returned to his native city. His reputation as a teacher of the Law having preceded him, many pupils gathered about him. As he was especially well versed in civil law, the exilarch Mar Ukba, who was his pupil, appointed him judge of the bet din at Nehardea, where he was associated with his friend the learned and clever Karna. This court was regarded at that time as the foremost institution of its kind. In Palestine, as well as in Babylon, Samuel and Karna were called the \"judges of the Diaspora\" (\"dayyanei Golah\"). Upon the death of Rav Shela, the director of the Academy (\"resh sidra\") of Nehardea, Samuel was appointed to the office, after it had been refused by Rav, who would not accept any post of honor at Nehardea, Samuel's home. The Academy of Nehardea entered upon a brilliant phase of its existence under Samuel's directorate, and, with the academy founded by Rav at Sura, enjoyed a high general reputation.\n\nRav at Sura and Samuel at Nehardea established the intellectual independence of Babylonian Jewry. Young men taking up the study of the Law there were no longer obliged to go to Palestine, since they had the foremost teachers at home. Babylon now came to be regarded, in a sense, as a second Holy Land. Samuel taught, \"As it is forbidden to migrate from Palestine to Babylon, so is it forbidden to migrate from Babylon to other countries\". After Rav's death no new director was elected, and Rav's greatest pupil, R. Huna, who became president of the court of Sura, subordinated himself to Samuel in every respect, asking his decision in every difficult religio-legal question.\n\nThe Academy of Nehardea was now the only one in Babylon, and its director, Samuel, who survived Rav about ten years, was regarded as the highest authority by the Babylonian Jews. Even Rabbi Yochanan, the most prominent teacher in Palestine, and who at first looked upon Samuel merely as a colleague, became so convinced of his greatness, after Samuel had sent him a large number of responsa on important ritual laws, that he exclaimed, \"I have a teacher in Babylon\".\n\nSamuel was unfortunate in his family life. He had no sons, and his two daughters were captured by soldiers during the war with the Romans. They were taken to Sepphoris, in Palestine, where they were ransomed by coreligionists, but both died at an early age after having been married successively to a relative. The esteem in which Samuel was held appears from the fact that no one thought of attributing his misfortune to any sin committed by him; it was explained rather as being in consequence of some offense committed in Babylon by R. Hananya, the nephew of R. Joshua. After his death, Samuel was glorified in legend.\n\nHe was the teacher of Rabbi Judah ben Ezekiel. Despite his status, Samuel was never ordained as a Tanna.\n\nSamuel amplified and expanded earlier legal theories and originated many new legal maxims. He formulated the important halakhic principle that \"the law of the kingdom is [binding] law. This principle made it a religious duty for the Jews to obey the laws of the country. Thus, although the Jews had their own civil courts, Samuel thought that the Persian law should be taken into account and that various Jewish regulations should be modified according to it. Due to his loyalty to the government and his friendship with the Sassanid king, Shapur I, Samuel was called Shabur Malka. Fürst and Rapoport refer, each differently, the name of Aryok, given to Samuel, to his close relations with the Neo-Persians and their king. Older commentators explain this name without reference to such relations.\n\nAs a man, Samuel was distinguished for his modesty, gentleness, and unselfishness, being always ready to subordinate his own interests to those of the community. He said: \"A man may never exclude himself from the community, but must seek his welfare in that of society\". He was known for being very precise with his words. He demanded seemly behavior from every one, saying that any improper conduct was punishable by law. One should help one's fellow man at the first signs of approaching difficulties, so as to prevent them, and not wait until he is in actual distress. In his solicitude for helpless orphans he imposed upon every court the task of acting as father to them, and he declared that a loan taken from an orphan was not canceled in the Sabbatical year, even if no prozbul had been made out for it. He stored his grain until prices had risen, in order to sell it to the poor at the low prices of the harvest-time. In order to save the people from being cheated he ordered the merchants never to take a profit of more than one-sixth of the cost price, and he was ready even to temporarily modify the Law in order to prevent them from selling at a high price goods necessary for the fulfillment of a religious duty. In a certain case also he permitted the infraction of a religious prescription in order to keep people from harm.\n\nSamuel was very modest in his associations with others, openly honoring any one from whom he had gained any knowledge. He never obstinately insisted on his own opinion, but yielded as soon as he was convinced of being in error. He was friendly to all men, and declared: \"It is forbidden to deceive any man, be he Jew or pagan\". \"Before the throne of the Creator there is no difference between Jews and pagans, since there are many noble and virtuous among the latter\". He taught that the dignity of womanhood should be respected even in the slave: the slave is given to the master only as a servant, and the master has no right to treat her with condescension or to have marital relations in the presence of the slaves. Once, when a female slave had been taken away from Samuel and he had unexpectedly recovered her by paying a ransom, he felt obliged to liberate her because he had given up hope of recovering her.\n\nFollowing the example of his teacher Levi ben Sisi, Samuel collected the traditions handed down to him. His collection of baraitot, called \"Tanna debei Shemu'el\" in the Talmud, was noted for its correctness and trustworthiness, although it was not held in such high esteem as were the collections of R. Hiyya and R. Hoshaiah. Samuel did much to elucidate the Mishnah, both by his textual explanations and by his precise paraphrasing of ambiguous expressions and his references to other traditions. He is chiefly important, however, because of his promulgation of new theories and his independent decisions both in ritual and in civil law. However, in the field of ritual law he was not considered as great an authority as his colleague Rav, and practical questions were always decided according to Rav's views as against those of Samuel. In civil law his authority was the highest in Babylon, and his decisions became law even when contrary to Rav's.\n\nSamuel seems to have possessed a thorough knowledge of the science of medicine as it was known in his day; this is evident from many of his medical maxims and dietetic rules scattered through the Talmud. He energetically opposed the view then current, even in intelligent circles, that most diseases were due to the evil eye, declaring that the source of all disease must be sought in the noxious influence exercised by the air and the climate upon humans. He traced many diseases to lack of cleanliness, and others to disturbances of the regular mode of living. He claimed to possess cures for most diseases, and was especially skillful in treating the eye; he discovered an eye-salve which was known as the \"killurin [κολλύριον] of Mar Samuel,\" although he himself said that bathing the eyes with cold water in the morning and bathing hands and feet with warm water in the evening were better than all the eye-salves in the world. Samuel discovered also a number of the diseases of animals. He sometimes drew the figure of a palm branch as his signature, although perhaps this was used by physicians generally at that time as a sign of their profession.\n\nSamuel had a special affinity for astronomy. From the scattered references in the Talmud it is impossible to determine exactly his proficiency in astronomy; but he knew how to solve many mathematics problems and how to explain many phenomena. He says himself: \"Although I am as familiar with the courses of the stars as with the streets of Nehardea, I cannot explain the nature or the movements of the comets\". Samuel devoted himself especially to that branch of applied astronomy that deals with calendric science, which he taught to his colleagues and pupils. His studies of the moon enabled him to predict the beginning of the month as it was determined in Palestine, and he claimed to be able to remove the necessity of celebrating double holy days in the Diaspora. He also computed a Hebrew calendar for sixty years, which he subsequently sent to R. Johanan, the head of the Palestinian teachers, as a proof of his knowledge. He was called \"Yarkhina'ah\" or \"Yarkhinai\" (Hebrew: שמואל ירחינאה; \"yerakh\" = \"month\") because of this familiarity with calendric science and this ability to determine independently the beginning of the month. According to Krochmal \"Shoḳed,\" another name given to Samuel, means \"astronomer\". But Hoffmann's view that \"Shoḳed\" means \"the watchful, diligent one\" is more likely correct. This name is said to have been given to Samuel because, despite his medical and astronomic studies, he devoted himself to the study of the Law.\n\nIt was due to Mar Samuel's influence with the Persian king that the Jews were granted many privileges. On one occasion Samuel even made his love for his own people subsidiary to his loyalty to the Persian king and to his strict view of the duties of a citizen; for when the news came that the Persians, on capturing Mazaca, had killed 12,000 Jews who had obstinately opposed them, Samuel refrained from displaying any sorrow. It is worth noting that Samuel formulated the Talmudic dictum that \"the law of the state is to be upheld\" ().\n\nR' Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog disagrees with that interpretation. First, Samuel intended to demonstrate a Law not his emotions on the subject. Second, Samuel held that the Messianic Era would arrive through natural means. Samuel may have believed that King Shapur I was destined to usher in the 3rd temple era as Cyrus had been before him. Therefore those Jews who fought on the side of the Roman Emperor Julian were prolonging the exile and not worthy of being mourned.\n\nBut he had a great love for his people, and he loyally cherished the memory of the former kingdom of Judah. Once, when one of his contemporaries adorned himself with a crown of olive, Samuel sent him the following message: \"The head of a Jew that now wears a crown while Jerusalem lies desolate, deserves to be separated from its trunk\". Samuel declared that \"There will be no difference between this world and the messianic age, except for [the ending of] subjugation [of Israel] to [foreign] kingdoms\".\n\n\n It has the following bibliography:\n"}

His official debut as Fred's new voice was in the 1977 syndicated weekday series \"Fred Flintstone and Friends\" for which he provided voice-overs on brief bumper clips shown in-between segments, although he had previously provided the singing voice for Reed in the 1966 theatrical film \"The Man Called Flintstone\" and the Hanna-Barbera specials \"Alice in Wonderland or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?\" (1966) and \"\" (1977).\n\nCorden was born in Montreal as Henry Cohen to Max and Emma Cohen. His father was a meat curer who had been born in Romania; his mother was originally from Russia. The family moved to the Bronx, New York when Corden was a child and he arrived in Hollywood in the 1940s.\n\nHe appeared on the stage in Los Angeles and Hollywood, including a 1947 production of \"The Message\". His film career included \"The System\" (1952), where he played a near-sighted gangster named Specs. Corden thought it would be the first time in 25 films he could wear his glasses and see while he was acting, but the lenses gave off too much reflection and he had to substitute them for plain glass after one day of shooting.\n\nCorden's obituary in the \"Tampa Bay Times\" noted, \"With his deep voice, jet-black hair and ethnic looks, Corden was frequently tapped to play heavies in films and on television.\"[2] He can be seen in such live-action films as \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\", \"The Black Castle\", \"Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion\" and \"The Ten Commandments\". He also appeared in dozens of TV shows, including \"Hogan's Heroes\" (in 5 episodes), \"Dragnet\", \"Perry Mason\", \"Peter Gunn\", \"McHale's Navy\" (in 5 episodes), \"Gunsmoke\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and was a regular on \"The Jerry Lewis Show\". Corden also played landlord Henry Babbitt on \"The Monkees\" and Mr. Haskell, the owner of an ice cream parlor, in an episode of \"The Brady Bunch\".\n\nBefore Reed's death, Corden had been used as Reed's replacement when Fred Flintsone had to sing because Reed could not sing on pitch. Corden gave his voice to a number of Hanna-Barbera productions besides \"The Flintstones\", including \"The Jetsons\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\", \"The Atom Ant Show\", \"The New Tom & Jerry Show\" and \"Jonny Quest\". Corden also gave voice to the wizard Gemini and Ookla the Mokk in Ruby-Spears Productions' \"Thundarr the Barbarian\" as well as the Gorilla General Urko in DePatie-Freleng Enterprises' \"Return to the Planet of the Apes\". He voiced Arnie Barkley, the Archie Bunker-inspired patriarch of DePatie-Freleng's \"The Barkleys\", in 1972.\n\nCorden was married four times. His first wife was Thelma Corden, from 1942 to 1969; together they had two children. He and his second wife Shirley W. Cytron were married from 1970 to 1979.

Mel Blanc voiced all characters. This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (cartoons). This was the first Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short makes several direct references to \"The Song of Hiawatha\", an epic poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This was Bugs' first encounter with a Native American. This is a parody of the Silly Symphonies cartoon \"Little Hiawatha\". In fact, the character is a parody of the legendary Disney animator, Ward Kimball.\n\nThe cooking-pot sequence from this cartoon would be directly incorporated three years later in the 1944 Bugs Bunny cartoon What's Cookin' Doc?, although Bugs' facial appearance had subtly changed in the interim. The central joke in that film is Bugs losing the Oscar to fellow Warner actor James Cagney. Showing clips specifically from Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt provides some context to that storyline. In 1995, Turner Entertainment restored the original titles of the short for its American and European Turner \"dubbed\" versions.\nThis cartoon was one of the 12 Bugs cartoons pulled out of the Cartoon Network June Bugs marathon in 2001 because of racial stereotypes (in this case, the Native American hunter).\n\nBugs is reading \"The Song of Hiawatha\" out loud to himself and the saga turns real as a pint-sized, Elmer Fudd-like Hiawatha (minus the speech impediment) turns up, paddling his canoe. Hiawatha is looking for a rabbit for his dinner. Hiawatha manages to trick Bugs into thinking he is preparing a hot bath for him. It is actually a cooking pot, which Bugs quickly vacates once Hiawatha casually mentions that he is having rabbit stew for supper.\n\nAs with Elmer, Bugs spends the rest of the cartoon tormenting his would-be devourer, who finally breaks his arrows in anger and disgust, and paddles his canoe away while Bugsy finishes his reading of the poem. However, in the closing gag, the miffed-looking Hiawatha suddenly returns to the foreground where Bugs is reading the narrative, and after a second of wordless staring at each other, Hiawatha gives Bugs the \"insulting kiss\" that the Bunny usually bestows on others. Hiawatha then paddles away again, as Bugs \"spits out\" the kiss.\n\n\n"}

It is the second instalment in the \"Once Upon a Time in China\" film series. The iconic theme song, \"A Man Should Better Himself\" (男兒當自強), was performed in Cantonese by George Lam at the beginning of the film, and by Jackie Chan in the end credits. (Chan also sang the Mandarin version.)\n\nThe film is set in China in 1895 during the Qing dynasty. Wong Fei-hung travels by train from Foshan to Canton to attend a seminar on medicine. He is accompanied by his romantic interest 13th Aunt and apprentice Leung Foon. The situation in Canton is rather chaotic. On one hand, there are protests in the streets against the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. On the other hand, the White Lotus Sect, a xenophobic cult, goes around attacking Westerners and destroying everything regarded as alien to Chinese culture. At one point, 13th Aunt is almost captured by the cult when she tries to take a photo of them, but Wong shows up, fights with the cult members, and saves her.\n\nWong gives a lecture on acupuncture at the seminar while a Western-trained Chinese doctor, Sun Wen, helps him translate for the predominantly non-Chinese audience. The seminar is disrupted when the White Lotus Sect shoot flaming arrows into the building; Wong, Leung and Sun manage to escape safely. Wong feels that Canton is not safe and wants to bring Leung and 13th Aunt with him back to Foshan. However, just as they are about to leave, they learn that the White Lotus Sect is attacking the Tongwen Guan, a school for Chinese children to study foreign languages. They head over and save the children. The innkeeper refuses to allow the children to remain in his inn because he is worried that the White Lotus Sect will find trouble with him.\n\nWhen Wong goes to the local government office to ask if the children can take shelter there, he encounters a military officer, Nap-lan Yun-seut, who spars with him to test his skill in using the staff. Although Nap-lan is impressed with Wong's skill, he does not approve Wong's request. In the meantime, Leung and 13th Aunt bring the children to hide in the British consulate, which is under siege by the White Lotus Sect. At the consulate, Wong meets Sun Wen again and learns that Sun and his friend, Lu Haodong, are part of an underground movement planning to overthrow the Qing government and establish a republic in China. Nap-lan shows up with his soldiers and tries to enter the consulate to capture Lu but the British consul stops him. That night, Nap-lan orders his men to disguise themselves as White Lotus Sect members and break into the consulate. After some time, he leads his soldiers into the consulate under the pretext of protecting the consul and arresting the cult members while actually using the opportunity to hunt down Lu. He secretly kills the British consul when the latter sees through his ruse.\n\nLu disguises himself as Leung and follows Wong out of the consulate, while Leung pretends to be Lu to distract Nap-lan. Wong and Lu are then forced to travel to the White Lotus Sect's base to confront Priest Gao, the cult's leader. After fighting with the cult members and engaging Gao in a one-on-one fight, Wong defeats Gao and accidentally kills him by causing him to be impaled on a sharp end on a statue. Wong, Leung and Lu then proceed to retrieve a book, which contains the names of the revolutionaries, from a secret location. However, they encounter Nap-lan and his soldiers, and Lu is fatally shot. While Wong fights with Nap-lan to buy time, Lu and Leung burn the book to prevent it from falling into the Qing government's hands. Before succumbing to his wounds, Lu stops Leung from burning the cloth used to wrap the book and tells him to meet Sun Wen at the pier and pass him the cloth.\n\nWong and Leung try to escape but they are cornered by Nap-lan. Wong and Nap-lan fight using a bamboo staff and a \"cloth staff\" (a twisted, long piece of cloth) respectively. During the fight, Nap-lan manages to wrap the cloth around Wong's neck and tries to strangle him, but Wong manages to free himself and slit Nap-lan's throat with a sharp splinter from his broken bamboo staff. As dawn approaches, Wong and Leung make it to the pier, where they throw the cloth to Sun Wen, who opens it up to reveal Lu's design of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag.\n\nOn 2 July 2001, DVD was released in Hong Kong Legends at Europe in Region 2.\n\nTwo years later, Hong Kong Legends DVD were released on 7 April 2003 at 3 disc set \"Tsui Hark's Once Upon a Time in China Trilogy\".\n\nThree years later, The Donnie Yen Collection DVD were released on 29 May 2006 at 4 disc set including two films they were \"New Dragon Gate Inn\" and 2 disc platinum edition \"Iron Monkey.\"\n\nThe Taiwanese VHS release distributed by Long Shong opens with a seven-minute-long recap of the first film. It also features some scenes that were cut from the international release.\n\n\"Once Upon a Time in China II\" was a rare instance where a sequel to a Hong Kong film earned higher at the box office as compared to the previous film. It grossed a total of HK$30,399,676 during its theatrical run and holds a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}

It is the third instalment in the \"Once Upon a Time in China\" film series.\n\nThe film is set in China in the late 19th century during the Qing dynasty when Chinese sovereignty is being eroded by foreign imperialism. Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Hongzhang decide to stage a lion dance competition to showcase Chinese martial arts and restore national pride. Interested parties from all over China are invited to participate and compete for the title of \"Lion Dance King\".\n\nWong Fei-hung travels by train from Foshan to Beijing with his romantic interest 13th Aunt and apprentice Leung Foon to meet his father, Wong Kei-ying, at the Cantonese Ten Tigers Association. At the train station, 13th Aunt meets Tomanovsky, a Russian diplomat, who was her classmate when she was studying in Britain. He starts vying for her attention and annoys Wong, who is disgusted by the Western custom of kissing a woman's hand. When Wong reaches the Association, he learns that his father has been attacked by a wealthy rival martial artist, Chiu Tin-bak, and Chiu's henchman, Clubfoot. Luckily, the elder Wong sustained only minor injuries. Wong Kei-ying decides to give his blessings to his son and 13th Aunt when he sees their romantic relationship.\n\nBefore the competition officially begins, all the lion dance troupes that have gathered in Beijing are already fighting among themselves and holding another competition of their own. Wong does not participate and spectates instead. Unknown to him, Leung and his friends have secretly joined the competition out of mischief. A short chase takes place between Clubfoot and Leung when the latter annoys the former during the contest and flees. Clubfoot's legs are crushed when Leung accidentally releases a stampede of horses from a stable. Chiu abandons Clubfoot when he sees that he is now a useless cripple. Wong takes pity on Clubfoot, brings him in, and heals his legs. Clubfoot is initially hostile towards Wong, but he feels so touched and grateful to Wong that he starts bawling emotionally, and becomes Wong's new apprentice.\n\nWith the aid of a camera given to her by Tomanovsky, 13th Aunt inadvertently uncovers a plot to assassinate Li Hongzhang during the competition and learns that Tomanovsky is one of the conspirators. She warns Wong, who joins the contest to stop the assassins. In the final round of the competition, Wong, Leung and Clubfoot fight with dozens of rival lion dancers as they battle their way to the top of a scaffold. Chiu also joins the competition and carries a large and deadly lion mask. Wong ultimately defeats Chiu and wins the competition.\n\nIn the meantime, Tomanovsky fails to assassinate Li Hongzhang and is shot dead by his fellow Russians, who claim to the Chinese that he was a spy working for the Japanese. Although Wong wins the prize (a gold medal), he remarks that it is ultimately a defeat for the Chinese because of all the infighting. He then tosses the medal back to Li Hongzhang, turns his back and walks away.\n\n\n\nThe film was released in Hong Kong on VHS by Paragon Films in 1996. The opening is in Mandarin while the rest of the film is in Cantonese. It was converted from a LaserDisc and some chapters are incorrectly arranged. The film was released again in Hong Kong on DVD by Hong Kong Legends on 21 January 2002.\n\nThe Taiwanese release of the film is in Mandarin and has 15 minutes more footage than the Hong Kong version. It was distributed by Long Shong Pictures and features a 4:3 cropped image with embedded Chinese and English subtitles, and the distributor's logo on the upper left corner of the screen.\n\nBoth the Hong Kong and Taiwanese versions were released on DVD in North America by Columbia TriStar. There is also an English export version of the film called \"The Invincible Shaolin\". In comparison with the original version, the end credits of \"The Invincible Shaolin\" are in English and some footage is cut out.\n\n"}

CU-SeeMe can make point to point video calls without a server or make multi-point calls through server software first called a \"reflector\" and later called a \"conference server\" or Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). Later commercial versions of CU-SeeMe could also make point-to-point or multi-point calls to other vendor's standards-based H.323 endpoints and servers.\n\nCU-SeeMe was originally written by Tim Dorcey of the Information Technology department at Cornell University. It was first developed for the Macintosh in 1992 and later for the Windows platform in 1994. Originally it was video-only with audio added in 1994 for the Macintosh and 1995 for Windows. CU-SeeMe's audio came from Maven, an audio-only client developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nCU-SeeMe was introduced to the public on April 26, 1993 as part of an NSF funded education project called the Global Schoolhouse.\n\n\"It is Not About the Technology\" tells about Global SchoolNet's Global SchoolHouse Project using the first multi-point Internet-based video conferencing to connect schools in the United States and with schools worldwide. By sending video and audio signals over the Internet using CU-SeeMe software, students were able to see and hear each other while they worked on collaborative assignments. As part of the program they interacted with special guests, such as Vice President Al Gore, the anthropologist Jane Goodall, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and surgeon general C. Everett Koop.\n\nIn July 1993 now defunct London cable channel Channel One Television used CU-SeeMe to simulcast its programme Digital World on the Internet, becoming the first UK television programme to broadcast live on the web. The programme was frame-grabbed every 2 frames using a macro written in Windows by duo Thibault & Rav. \n\nIn 1994 WXYC used CU-SeeMe to simulcast its signal to the net and so became the world's first internet radio station.\n\nOn Thanksgiving morning in 1995, \"World News Now\" was the first television program to be broadcast live on the Internet, using a CU-SeeMe interface. Victor Dorff, a producer of \"WNN\" at the time, arranged to have the show simulcast on the Internet daily for a six-month trial period. CU-SeeMe was also used in a taped interview segment in which anchor Kevin Newman and Global Schoolhouse director and founder Dr. Yvonne Marie Andres discussed the future of computers in communication.\n\nIn March 1996, CU-SeeMe was used for the first ever live webcast of a musical theatre performance with the production of \"Cowboys in Love: The Hank Plowplucker Story.\" The show was produced by The Ethereal Mutt - Limited, and the stream was a partnership between Emutt and the CIS staff at Arizona State University.\n\nThe Internet Phone Connection, written by Cheryl L. Kirk was one of the first consumers books to feature CuSeeMe. The book outlined how to use the program to communicate across the globe.\n\nCU-SeeMe 2.x was released as a commercial product in 1995 through an agreement with Cornell University. The full commercial licensing rights were transferred to White Pine Software in 1998.\n\nWhile not directly competing against hardware-assisted video-conferencing companies, it suffered in that the nascent market was expecting hardware quality audio and video when CPUs of that time weren't really ready to support that quality level in software. Early wide acceptance of CU-SeeMe outside of the hobbyist market was limited by its relatively poor audio/video quality and excessive latency. While the commercial and freeware products were useful to hobbyists, CU-SeeMe and its accompanying server product were beginning to build a following in education - with up to 40% of commercial sales from educational establishments. (A spinoff application called ClassPoint which was based on CU-SeeMe and the conference server was released commercially in 1998. It was an early attempt to add features to a real-time collaboration product specifically designed for K-20 education users.)\n\nThe United States military was a large customer of the technology, making use of the CU-SeeMe Conference Server MCU for many applications, including using the T.120 server for Microsoft NetMeeting endpoints.\n\nWhite Pine locked out users of version 1.0 from using its free, public videoconferencing chatrooms. As users upgraded to the commercially available version, some were frustrated to discover that others were downloading the trial version and using software registration keys readily supplied by some participants on White Pine's public chatrooms.\n\nWhite Pine Software was briefly renamed CUseeMe Networks, then merged with First Virtual Communications. The commercial standalone client was decommissioned (an independent company used a version of the embedded commercial CU-SeeMe client renamed \"CU\" as part of a fee-based video chat service called CUworld). The commercial client and server environment evolved further, was renamed \"Click To Meet\" and launched along with an enhanced and more scalable version of the software MCU.\n\nOn March 15, 2005, Radvision Ltd. acquired all of the substantial assets and intellectual property of First Virtual Communications (FVC), including its 'Click to Meet' (formerly CUSeeMe) and Conference Server. Radvision was acquired by Avaya in June 2012. Spirent Communications acquired Radvision's Technology Business Unit from Avaya in July 2014. The descendants of the CU-SeeMe technology live on in part in the Radvision Scopia product line.\n\nThere is still a small but active community of users of the original CU-SeeMe releases. Although there have been no releases of software from the various incarnations of White Pine since roughly 2000, freeware alternatives are available for both the Windows and Macintosh platform.\n\nThe CU-SeeMe name and legacy remains important for a number of reasons:\n\n\n\n"}

He campaigned against the death penalty throughout the 1960s, particularly against the execution of Ronald Ryan. He is on the National Trust's list of Australian Living Treasures.\n\nBarry Jones was born in Geelong, Victoria, and educated at Melbourne High School and the University of Melbourne, where he studied arts and law. He began his career as a schoolteacher at Dandenong High School, where he taught for nine years, before becoming a household name as an Australian quiz champion in the 1960s on Bob Dyer's \"Pick a Box\", a radio show from 1948, televised from 1957. He was known for taking issue with Dyer about certain expected answers, most famously in response to a question about \"the first British Governor-General of India\", where he pointed out that Warren Hastings was technically only the Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal Presidency. Jones' appearances on \"Pick a Box\" lasted from 1960 to 1968.\n\nHe famously claimed that in the future there would be more computers than cars in Tasmania. The sceptisim provoked by the claim was highlighted by former prime minister Julia Gillard as an example of a lack of imagination about the future.\n\nJones also tried his hand at broadcasting on Melbourne radio in the mid-1960s. He was one of the pioneers of talkback radio, working at 3DB in Melbourne. His show \"Talkback to Barry Jones\" and Mike Walsh's show on Sydney's 2SM were Australia's first talkback shows. Jones believes that modern talkback shows have a much narrower focus than the original shows. He says \"I was trying to convey to people a sense of what they didn't know rather than simply talk about football or pets. My emphasis was on using talkback as an instrument for exposing people to new ideas and challenging them, rather than just reinforcing the ideas they already held.\" Jones was a panelist on 3DB's popular program, \"Information Please\".\n\nA member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1950, Jones was a Federal candidate in 1955, 1958 and 1963, with a strong interest in education and civil liberties.\n\nJones's political career began in the Victorian Parliament where he represented the electorate of Melbourne as a Labor Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1972 to 1977, when he resigned to go into federal politics.\n\nIn 1977, he was elected to the House of Representatives as the Labor member for the Federal seat of Lalor in Victoria, which he held until his retirement in 1998. He was Minister for Science in the Hawke government from 1983 to 1990, in which role he presided over the growth of organisations such as the CSIRO, the creation of the Australia Prize, Questacon and the Commission for the Future. Jones lost his place in the ministry when he failed to gain the backing of his centre-left faction.\n\nIn 1992, upon the resignation of Stephen Loosley, to whom he had lost the position in a split vote in 1991, he was elected National President of the ALP, serving until 2000. He became National President again in 2005–06.\n\nJones was the chief architect of the ALP's Knowledge Nation education concept, as chair of the Chifley Research Centre's Knowledge Nation Taskforce. During this time he was also a member of the Council of the National Library of Australia.\n\nHe was the Vice-President of the World Heritage Committee from 1995 to 1996 and a member of the Executive Board of UNESCO from 1991 until 1995.\n\nJones and Ian Sinclair served as co-chairs of the 1998 Constitutional Convention on an Australian republic.\n\nJones attended the selective Melbourne High School in South Yarra before continuing to the University of Melbourne where he graduated with Bachelor of Laws and Master of Arts degrees. Jones holds the honorary degrees of Doctor of Letters from the University of Technology Sydney and University of Wollongong, Doctor of Science from Macquarie University and Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne.\n\nIn 1999 he was appointed an adjunct professor at Monash University and became a Vice-Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Melbourne in 2005.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA); a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA); a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (FASSA); and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE): he was the first (and so far the only) person elected Fellow of all four Australian learned academies. In 1999 he was elected a Visiting Fellow Commoner at Trinity College, Cambridge. He is also a Fellow of the Australian College of Educators (FACE), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Victoria (FRSV)., and a Distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales (DistFRSN).\n\nJones chaired the Victorian Schools Innovation Commission from 2001 until 2005. He chaired the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority from 2000 to 2005 and serves on the boards of several medical research institutes. Jones was the founding Chair of the Advisory Board to In2science, a peer mentoring program that builds enthusiasm of Victorian secondary school students for science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) . On 31 October 2008, Jones was appointed to serve on the board of the Victorian Opera.\n\nHe appeared regularly as a member of the Brains Trust on the television quiz show \"The Einstein Factor\". He mentioned on an episode of the show that he likes to watch his Wikipedia page grow.\n\nOn 9 April 2010, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, announced the formation of the Book Industry Strategy Group (BISG) with Jones as chair. The group submitted its report in September 2011.\n\nBarry Jones Bay in the Australian Antarctic Territory and \"Yalkaparidon jonesi\", an extinct marsupial, were named after him. He is the owner of the largest private autograph collection in Australia.\n\nJones has maintained a long-standing public profile as an outspoken opponent of capital punishment.\n\nJones's stated position on voluntary euthanasia in the past has been inconclusive but in the Australian parliament he has voted against euthanasia–enabling laws in the Northern Territory. He has noted that popular support is not of itself a compelling reason for its adoption. In the same frequently cited speech from 1996 he noted that \"No other issue has troubled me so much because I am not sure that I am correct\".\n\nJones claims to have been an early advocate for action on climate change, first advocating for his cabinet colleagues to support action in 1984.\n\nJones has been a prolific author of political and sociological books, including:\n\n"}

In the 1990s, Lau decided to have more creative freedom as a cinematographer by becoming a film director and producer. Apart from making films in his native Hong Kong, Lau has also made films in China, Korea and the United States. A highly prolific filmmaker, Lau has made films in a variety of genres, and is most notable in the West for his action and crime films which include the \"Young and Dangerous\" film series, the \"Infernal Affairs\" trilogy (the latter co-directed together with Alan Mak), and \"Revenge of the Green Dragons\" (executive produced by Martin Scorsese).\n\nAndrew Lau was born 4 April 1960, and is one of six siblings. As a child, he was raised in the New Territories of Hong Kong. His father worked as a construction worker on Hong Kong Island. Since his parents did not have time to concentrate on all of their children, Lau had developed an interest in photography. Lau was also a Catholic, and would go to church every week, learning how to play a guitar. As a child and high school student, Lau admits to not liking Hong Kong, since it was a British colony.\n\nHe currently has 4 children, 3 sons and a daughter.\n\nLau joined Shaw Brothers Studios after graduating from secondary school. He made his film debut as a semi-skilled cinematographer for Lau Kar-leung’s 1982 film, \"Legendary Weapons of China\". He later served as a cinematographer for Sammo Hung's 1986 martial arts film \"Millionaire's Express\" and Ringo Lam's 1987 crime thriller \"City on Fire\", where he became known for his use of lighting and hand-held cinematography. His work on \"As Tears Go By\" (1988), the directorial debut of Wong Kar-wai, earned him his first Hong Kong Film Award nomination for Best Cinematography.

Lau went on to make films for prolific filmmaker Wong Jing, including the 1993 Category III film \"Raped by an Angel\" and the 1994 film \"To Live and Die in Tsimshatsui\". In 1996, Lau directed and photographed the 1996 film \"Young and Dangerous\", a film centered on Hong Kong's Triad society. The film was a huge success in Hong Kong, but also gained controversy for its glorification of Triads. The film spawned a several sequels and spin-offs, in which Lau directed seven sequels and one prequel. While filming the franchise, Lau teamed up with screenwriter Manfred Wong and film producer Wong Jing to establish BoB and Partners Co. Ltd., a company responsible for films made by the trio of filmmakers. The trio's collaborations proved to be successful with films such as \"The Storm Riders\", \"The Legend of Speed\", and \"The Duel\".\n\nIn 2002, Lau established Basic Pictures, a company responsible for the films in which he served as a producer and director. That year saw the success of \"Infernal Affairs\" a crime thriller that the largest ensemble cast of any Hong Kong film that year. \"Infernal Affairs\" became a huge box-office success in Hong Kong, even being deemed as a \"box-office miracle\" at a time when Hong Kong cinema was said to have been lacking in creativity. \"Infernal Affairs\" also marked the first of several collaborations with co-director Alan Mak, and screenwriter Felix Chong. Other films made by the directors and screenwriter include the sequels to \"Infernal Affairs\" (\"Infernal Affairs II\" and \"Infernal Affairs III\"), \"Initial D\" and \"Confession of Pain\".\n\nIn 2014, Lau directed an American action crime drama film \"Revenge of the Green Dragons\", which was co-directed by Andrew Loo and executive produced by Martin Scorsese.

It was dedicated to and premiered by Robert Hausmann, who later co-premiered Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto with Joseph Joachim, the dedicatee of Bruch's most famous work, the Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor. Hausmann had requested such a cello work from Bruch.\n\nIt is styled as an \"Adagio on 2 Hebrew Melodies for Cello and Orchestra with Harp\" and consists of a series of variations on two main themes of Jewish origin. The first theme, which also lends the piece its title, comes from the Kol Nidre declaration, which is recited during the evening service on Yom Kippur. In Bruch's setting of the melody, the cello imitates the rhapsodic voice of the cantor who chants the liturgy in the synagogue. The second subject of the piece is quoted from the middle section of Isaac Nathan's arrangement of \"O Weep for Those that Wept on Babel's Stream\", a lyric which was penned by Lord Byron in his collection \"Hebrew Melodies\" (which also includes the famous poem \"She Walks in Beauty\").\n\nBruch was a Protestant and first became acquainted with the Kol Nidre melody when his teacher Ferdinand Hiller introduced him to the Lichtenstein family, the head of which served as the cantor-in-chief of Berlin. Cantor Abraham Jacob Lichtenstein was known to have cordial relations with many Christian musicians and supported Bruch's interest in Jewish folk music. While some commentators, including Abraham Zevi Idelsohn, have criticized the lack of Jewish sentiment in Bruch's concert-hall \"Kol Nidrei\", Bruch never presumed to write Jewish music. He only wished to incorporate Jewish inspirations into his own compositions. \n\nThe work is scored for solo cello, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, harp and strings.\n\n"}

It was partitioned in 1622 between itself, Königsegg-Aulendorf and Königsegg-Rothenfels.\n\nIn 1629, Königsegg was raised to an imperial estate and became a member of the College of the Counts of Swabia at the Reichstag. With the extinction of its male line in 1663, it was inherited by Königsegg-Aulendorf.\n\nIn 1804, Königsegg sold Rothenfels to Austria.

{"id": "1971589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971589", "title": "Apollo (comics)", "text": "Apollo (comics)\n\nApollo is a fictional character, a comic book superhero who first appeared in the \"Stormwatch\" series, but is best known for his role in \"The Authority\". While visually distinct, Apollo is cast in the mould of the Superman archetype.\n\nApollo is notable for being among the first openly gay superheroes in print, although several years behind Marvel Comics' Northstar. He married fellow The Authority member Midnighter and both adopted Jenny Quantum.\n\nWarren Ellis introduced the character shortly after taking over writing duties on the \"Stormwatch\" title, when he had Apollo and Midnighter encounter the then-active Stormwatch team. The story was set in 1998, immediately after Bendix's fall, when Christine Trelane had cracked Bendix's old files and discovered evidence that two rogue former Bendix agents remained alive. In flashbacks, Apollo was introduced as a member of a \"black ops\" Stormwatch team so secret that no one but the first Weatherman, Henry Bendix, knew of its existence. Apollo's solar-powered abilities—including super-strength, heat vision, and a high degree of invulnerability—were presented as the consequence of Bendix's bioengineering.\n\nThe first story arc (collected in the Stormwatch trade paperback A Finer World) described how, of the seven-member team, only Apollo and Midnighter survived, going rogue after their first Stormwatch Black mission and spending five years undercover fighting for a finer world in the alleyways of America. Jackson King intercepted them on a mission to seize weapons made in the \"Nevada Garden\", a leftover of the first Engineer. He ordered Fahrenheit and Hellstrike to tag them with fetishes so they could be transported into SkyWatch. At first Apollo and Midnighter attacked the Stormwatch team, believing them under Bendix's orders. However, they ceased the attack once they were told Bendix was dead. With King's help, they destroyed the Nevada Garden, and Trelane gave them new lives away from Stormwatch.\n\nIn 1999, when Warren Ellis concluded his run on \"Stormwatch\" with the Final Orbit storyline which saw the team destroyed, Apollo was one of several Stormwatch characters he retained for his new Wildstorm title, \"The Authority\". In it, Apollo (along with Midnighter) was recruited by Jenny Sparks for a new team, the Authority, under her leadership. The new series picked up themes Ellis had explored in \"Stormwatch\", including the political potential of a team more powerful than world governments and the United Nations.\n\nApollo featured prominently in early story arcs, producing a miles-long wall of flame to contain super clones attacking London, rescuing civilians from disaster zones, and shooting down invaders from a parallel universe. In \"The Authority\" #10, Apollo sterilised the moon, killing the alien parasites that were using it as a base from which to attack Earth. He formed a friendship with leader Jenny Sparks, and his relationship with Midnighter was revealed in \"The Authority\" #8, written by Warren Ellis. For the portrayal of Apollo and Midnighter, the Authority received a GLAAD award.\n\nThe fourth \"Authority\" story arc saw Jenny Sparks die with the end of the 20th century and the Authority join a battle with U.S. government-backed superhumans to secure custody of her successor, Jennifer Quantum, the infant spirit of the 21st century. During this battle, Apollo was severely beaten by \"Storm God\", a Thor pastiche, and \"The Commander\", a Captain America pastiche. In one of author Mark Millar's most controversial scenes, it was implied that the beating was followed by a rape (\"The Authority\" #14). The rape was followed by a scene of revenge, in which it is implied that Midnighter raped the Commander with a jackhammer.\n\nIn another Millar-penned story, the Authority faced a rogue Doctor, intent on planetary destruction. Though this Doctor ultimately repented of his crimes, Apollo killed him with his eye-beams. Apollo featured also in the Transfer of Power storyline, in which the Authority was defeated, captured and usurped by sadistic, government-controlled replacements. Apollo was kept aboard the Carrier and brutalised by Midnighter's and his own replacements. The latter tried to rape Apollo before the real Midnighter returned to kill Apollo's assailant. Apollo himself then burned the head off Midnighter's replacement, later doing the same to \"the Machine\", who had taken the powers of the Engineer.\n\nApollo and Midnighter were married and adopted Jenny Quantum at the end of Millar's run. From this point on, Apollo is referred to as Midnighter's husband, and vice versa.\n\nApollo received comparatively little attention during this volume, although his friendship with the Engineer was developed and the two became confidants.\n\nIn this standalone graphic novel, the U.S. President ordered an assault on the Authority which saw them nearly defeated by doubts, depression and human foibles. Each team member's weakness was exploited; in Apollo's case this appeared to be jealousy in his relationship with Midnighter, who confessed to Apollo that he had kissed another man. Apollo, enraged, hit Midnighter hard enough to knock him through several walls. This scene remains the only canonical indication of violence between the two.\n\nAuthority: Coup D'État was a Wildstorm universe crossover event, in which—following a deadly mistake by U.S. leaders—Authority team leader Jack Hawksmoor decided to remove the U.S. executive branch and have the Authority itself run the country. The takeover went smoothly, but the occupation did not go as planned. Shadowy forces intervened to destroy the Authority and put corporate interests back in power. Apollo's part in the story involved traveling with Midnighter to raid the base of Stormwatch: Team Achilles. They arrived to find it booby-trapped. After narrowly escaping with their lives, their next mission was to eliminate the U.S. military's superhuman training camp. Midnighter returned with the declaration that the program was \"not so special.\"\n\nIn Authority: Revolution, a 12-part series by Ed Brubaker and Dustin Nguyen, Apollo was left to raise Jenny Quantum alone for three years after Midnighter, having received a sinister revelation about the future, left the Authority. The story described the break-up of the Authority after a humiliating nuclear incident destroys Washington D.C., precipitating the break-up of the team. The story turned on Jenny Quantum's decision, at age eight, to reform the team. To Apollo's initial horror she caused herself to jump in age to 14 years; after convincing him to support her, she set about rounding up the surviving members of the Authority, including Midnighter. In a painful moment between Jenny, Apollo and Midnighter, Jenny described herself to Midnighter as \"the product of a broken home.\"\n\nIn the battle that followed, it became clear that Henry Bendix had gained control over Midnighter through a Trojan Horse strategy which delivered nanites into Midnighter's body. Midnighter fought with Jenny and then Apollo, regaining clarity for just long enough to beg Apollo to kill him if he got the chance. Apollo refused and was defeated, but Jenny was able to engage Midnighter for long enough for the Engineer to remove the mind-control implants and restore Midnighter.\n\nIn 2006–2007, DC Comics's year-long weekly limited series, \"52\", identified the Wildstorm Universe as part of the DC Multiverse. Apollo, along with other Authority characters, appeared in several DC Universe titles as part of the crossover comics that followed, including in the 2007 series \"\", where he is shown as the closest \"Earth-50\" (Wildstorm Universe) approximation of DC Comics (and formerly Quality Comics) character the Ray, who is a member of the Freedom Fighters, and, as such, is also a counterpart of several other alternate versions of the Ray. However, Apollo is also traditionally viewed as a Superman analogue. \"Countdown: Arena\" writer Keith Champagne described the Ray-Apollo relationship on his blog:\n\n\"Final Crisis\" #7 depicts Apollo and Mister Majestic as both being legitimate Superman analogues for their Earth.\n\nThe 2008 Number of the Beast Wildstorm miniseries described the devastation of Earth and set the scene for a new Authority ongoing series, World's End, by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. In this series, Apollo is separated from Midnighter and the rest of the Authority when a thick layer of smog covers the Earth, preventing sunlight from reaching the surface. Apollo is forced to remain in the photosphere to absorb the radiation he needs to survive, visiting the surface only briefly to help the team. While on the surface, environmental conditions sap his powers, giving him a gaunt appearance and limiting his ability to fight.\n\nHe is later infected by the \"Warhol Fever\", a superpower-inducing virus, that evolves and becomes sentient by incubating in his body. Claiming to be \"The Burn\", the virus overrides his mind and attempts to escape into The Bleed. The Authority is forced to put Apollo in suspended animation, frozen and in an anaerobic room to keep the infection from spreading. He is eventually cured when Midnighter feeds him a piece of fruit he receives from the Century Baby, Gaia Rothstein.\n\nWhen the Authority reorganises and takes the Carrier into space, Apollo elects to stay on Earth, as he might be powerless during extended space travel. Midnighter stays with him.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Flashpoint\", the Wildstorm universe is merged with the DC Universe, creating new backstories for many characters. Along with 51 other titles, \"Stormwatch\" relaunched with an issue #1 as part of DC's \"The New 52\" company-wide revamp. In the new universe, Apollo starts off as a superpowered young man who first comes to the attention of Stormwatch after he uses his abilities to murder a child molester. Subsequently, a website uses Photoshop to create an image of Apollo battling Superman, the idea of which ultimately convinces Stormwatch to recruit him. Jack Hawksmoor, the Projectionist, and the Martian Manhunter hunt down Apollo and attempt to recruit him into the team, but he refuses, and a fight ensues. Just as he is overpowered, Midnighter arrives and defeats the Stormwatch members and then proposes a partnership between himself and Apollo. He and Midnighter gradually realise they are attracted to one another over the course of 18 issues, before DC restored its pre-reboot characterisations and designs for Midnighter and Apollo in its March 2013 \"Stormwatch\" #19. It then restored them to the original \"New 52\" designs with the series' final issue, \"Stormwatch\" #30, in preparation for DC's \"\" comic series, which is set to heavily feature former Wildstorm characters. Vaguely remembering a few weeks in an \"alternate timeline\" (\"Stormwatch\" #19-29), Apollo and Midnighter are nevertheless now a couple again, and Jenny Quantum is a team member again. \n\nBeginning with the new \"Midnighter\" series of 2015, Apollo and Midnighter are no longer a couple, due to conflicts over Midnighter's violent nature. They remain friends, however, with Midnighter sending Apollo a photo of himself as a boy when he discovers a file on his secret origin.\n\nThe character appears again along with his boyfriend, Midnighter, for a six-issue miniseries titled \"Midnighter and Apollo\", continuing in the \"New 52\" canon. Midnighter and Apollo have gotten back together as a couple. Apollo is attacked and his soul trapped in a hell dimension where he is detained by Neron.\n\nWriter Steve Orlando told \"The Advocate\" that \"I would say I feel pressure to showcase a realistic relationship, and that means neither an unattainable, idealized vision or an overly dysfunctional one. Real relationships are work, and I want to treat Midnighter and Apollo with the same respect, passion, and intricacy we all deal with in our own relationships on a daily basis.\"\n\nApollo's powers include superhuman strength, flight, and near invulnerability (the character has been shown entering a lava flow to deactivate a volcano, and walking on the surface of the sun). His eyes are constructed to concentrate solar energy into laser-like blasts. Apollo can also release his solar energy from other parts of his body (hands, mouth, etc.) or in an omnidirectional flare, but these moves are taxing. He can fly as well, at least fast enough to circle the globe in just under 30 seconds.\n\nLike Superman, Apollo's powers are dependent on the sun. His body behaves like a battery, absorbing sunlight and converting it into energy he can use. Without exposure to the sun his strength, resilience, and ability to fly diminish, ultimately to the point of disappearing—a concern, since aboard the Carrier he is often out of direct sunlight. From the point of exhaustion, he can regain the capacity for flight from 20 seconds of sun exposure. Two hours in sunlight restores him to full capacity. Transporting (using the Carrier's 'Door' system) into close proximity with the sun allows him to recharge more quickly.\n\nSince Apollo's energy derives entirely from the sun, he can survive in anaerobic environments indefinitely. He was shown in early issues of \"The Authority\" flying without protective equipment in space, explaining he could do so by the simple method of not breathing. He also does not require food or drink, though he apparently enjoys both.\n\nApollo has been described a number of times as a Majestic-class superhuman, suggesting that his powers are near the level of Mister Majestic, or are at least similarly beyond the frame of reference of most superhumans. In \"\" #4, Apollo is described by Father Time as a \"Superman-level\" superhuman.\n\nIn \"Wildstorm Winter Special 2005\", a story called \"Apollo & Midnighter: Two Dangerous Ideas\" features their alternate reality analogues, Pluto and Daylighter, with inverted color schemes to match. At first the real Midnighter believed that Daylighter was homophobic, but later learned that Pluto and Daylighter were a former couple that had broken up.\n\nIn \"Gen¹³\" vol. 4 #11 (written by Gail Simone), a teenage version of Apollo is a part of a team called \"The Authori-teens\" named Kid Apollo in the town of Tranquility, a fictional town in California. He and the teenage Midnighter, Daybreaker, would not appear to be out of the closet, although their romantic feelings for one another are still apparent.\n\nIn \"Midnighter\" #6, an alternate universe single-issue story set in feudal Japan, Apollo appeared as a peaceable but skillful swordsman and lover of a samurai Midnighter.\n\nIn the \"Flashpoint\" reality, Neil Sinclair volunteered for a government supersoldier program, as the government was looking to create \"the hero of tomorrow\". The government grafts Project Six DNA to Sinclair and, over time, he gains numerous superpowers. When his powers begin to get out of hand, he is locked away deep in a government bunker. He keeps the rest of his powers a secret and uses his X-ray vision to see through the bunker. Kal-El is later confined to the bunker when his rocket crashes into Metropolis. Sinclair telepathically mentors young Kal as he grows up. This eventually culminates in Kal setting Neil free. By this time, he has grown to great size. Sinclair goes on a rampage throughout the facility, eventually reaching Sam Lane's office. There he finds a young Lois Lane. He wishes to kill her as revenge for his confinement, but is opposed by Kal. Sam Lane appears with a Phantom Zone gun and he and Sam are sent into the Phantom Zone. Years later, Sinclair is freed from the Phantom Zone and kills Sam Lane. Sinclair absorbs Project Six's corpse to regain his powers. Sinclair then located Kal-El and Lois in western Europe and attacks them. During the fight with Kal-El and him, Sinclair's energy body is overloaded. Kal-El punches through Sinclair's chest, which destroys him.\n\n\n"}

It is located west of Katoomba. On its eastern side, the valley is separated from the Jamison Valley by Narrow Neck Plateau. The Shipley Plateau overlooks part of the valley.\n\nThe name Megalong Valley is derived from an Aboriginal word thought to mean 'Valley Under The Rock'. The first record of a European coming to the valley was of Thomas Jones, a natural history specimen collector, who followed the course of Coxs River from Hartley, New South Wales to Burragorang in 1818. The first land was taken up in 1838, by settlers who travelled from Burragorang and Camden, New South Wales. Later in the 19th century, a shale mine was operated by one J.B.North. He named a nearby glen after his daughter Nellie and it is still known as Nellies Glen today. The shale mine eventually went the way of all shale mines because they were not viable in the long run.\n\nToday the valley is still used for farming, but tourism has increased since the historic Six Foot Track was restored. This track was marked out in the 19th century as a bridle trail from Katoomba to Jenolan Caves. It was called the Six Foot Track because it had to be that wide in order to accommodate two to three riders riding abreast. It fell into disuse eventually but was restored as a walking trail by the Department of Lands in 1984. It begins at the Explorers Tree at Katoomba, goes down through Nellies Glen and across the Megalong Valley to Coxs River. On the other side of the river, the trail crosses some ranges before reaching Jenolan Caves Road. It then heads south to finish at Jenolan.\n\n"}

It provides low-overhead detection of faults even on physical media that doesn't support failure detection of any kind, such as Ethernet, virtual circuits, tunnels and MPLS Label Switched Paths.\n\nBFD establishes a session between two endpoints over a particular link. If more than one link exists between two systems, multiple BFD sessions may be established to monitor each one of them. The session is established with a three-way handshake, and is torn down the same way. Authentication may be enabled on the session. A choice of simple password, MD5 or SHA1 authentication is available.\n\nBFD does not have a discovery mechanism; sessions must be explicitly configured between endpoints. BFD may be used on many different underlying transport mechanisms and layers, and operates independently of all of these. Therefore, it needs to be encapsulated by whatever transport it uses. For example, monitoring MPLS LSPs involves piggybacking session establishment on LSP-Ping packets. Protocols that support some form of adjacency setup, such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP or RIP may also be used to bootstrap a BFD session. These protocols may then use BFD to receive faster notification of failing links than would normally be possible using the protocol's own keepalive mechanism.\n\nA session may operate in one of two modes: \"asynchronous mode\" and \"demand mode\". In asynchronous mode, both endpoints periodically send \"Hello\" packets to each other. If a number of those packets are not received, the session is considered down.\n\nIn demand mode, no \"Hello\" packets are exchanged after the session is established; it is assumed that the endpoints have another way to verify connectivity to each other, perhaps on the underlying physical layer. However, either host may still send \"Hello\" packets if needed.\n\nRegardless of which mode is in use, either endpoint may also initiate an \"Echo\" function. When this function is active, a stream of Echo packets is sent, and the other endpoint then sends these back to the sender via its forwarding plane. This is used to test the forwarding path on the remote system.\n\nIn June 2011 the BFD protocol standardization process entered the Proposed Standard stage. RFC 5880 defines the BFD protocol, detecting MPLS LSP failure, using BFD to monitor connectivity across multiple network hops, and using BFD for IPv4 and IPv6. BFD's operation in conjunction with Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and IS-IS protocols has also been outlined in RFC 5881.\n\n"}

The cartoon was directed by Tex Avery, written by Michael Maltese, animated by soon-to-be director Bob McKimson, and with musical direction by Carl Stalling. In style that was becoming typical of the Bugs character, he easily outwitted and tormented his antagonist through the short, his only concern being what to do next to the dog.\n\nThis is the second-to-last Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Tex Avery to be released. The last, \"All This and Rabbit Stew\", was produced before this film. Additionally, it was the fifth cartoon for Bugs and the 55th cartoon Avery directed at Warner Bros.\n\nThe \"Merrie Melodies\" opening sequence also featured the first usage of the Warner Bros. shield logo zooming in with a carrot-munching Bugs Bunny lying on top of it. Here, after the zoom-in and a couple of bites of his carrot, Bugs pulls down the \"Merrie Melodies\" title screen like it is a shade.\n\nInstead of Elmer Fudd, Bugs is hunted by a dog named Willoughby, but the dog falls for every trap Bugs sets for him until they both fall off a cliff at the end.\n\nThis cartoon appears in restored form on the DVD \"\". It is also included, unrestored, on \"\" as part of the 1990 TV special \"What's Up Doc? A Salute to Bugs Bunny\".\n\nThis is the cartoon that led to Avery leaving Warner Bros. and moving to MGM. The final gag of this cartoon originally had Bugs and Willoughby falling off \"three\" cliffs, with Bugs telling the audience after the second tumble, \"Hold on to your hats, folks. Here we go again!\" during the third trip down. Schlesinger intervened for reasons that are not known with certainty. The most popular story is that the \"Hold on to your hats\" line referred to a euphemism that was then in circulation; another story is that Schlesinger feared that Tex Avery had killed off Bugs Bunny by ending the cartoon with Bugs and Willoughby falling off the second cliff without a clear indication of whether or not the two survived.\n\nAccording to Martha Sigall, Schlesinger found the second fall to be repetitious and objected to its inclusion on those grounds. He instructed Avery to cut it, but Avery insisted that it should remain. Schlesinger simply overruled him as the boss. Karl F. Cohen suggests that Schlesinger found inappropriate an ending which suggests that Bugs gets killed. From Schlesinger's point of view the dispute was over his right to do as he pleased with the films he was paying for. From Avery's point of view, the dispute was over artistic interference.\n\nThe film was edited so that the characters only fall off a cliff once. After Bugs and Willoughby fall through the sky in a lengthy sequence, they \"put on the brakes\" and make a soft, feet-first landing on the ground.

It was co-organised by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), Japan Basketball Association (JABBA) and the 2006 Organizing Committee.\n\nFor the first time since 1986, the World Championship was contested by 24 nations, eight more than in 2002.

Pau Gasol also became the first Spaniard to win the MVP award. It was the first time a country has won all nine of its games since 1994 when the United States won all nine games and took the gold medal home. The bronze medal was won by the United States, who defeated Argentina, 96–81, in the third place game, after a crushing loss by Greece.

The rivers (from south to north) include: the Onkaparinga/Ngangki, Sturt/Warri Torrens/Karra Wirra, Little Para, Gawler, Light/Yarralinka and Wakefield/Undalya. The plains are generally fertile with annual rainfall of about per year.\n\nThe plain can be roughly divided into three parts. The southern area is now covered by the city of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia. The central area is considered the breadbasket of South Australia with many market gardens and wineries, particularly around the towns of Virginia and Angle Vale. The northern area is predominantly used for growing cereal grains such as wheat, barley, and canola, and farming sheep.\n\nUsage of the term \"Adelaide Plains\" frequently refers to a central and non-metropolitan subset of the plain.

Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by Myles Byrne in his memoirs.\n\n\"\"Flogging, half hanging, picketing, were mild tortures in comparison of the pitch caps that were applied to the heads of those who happened to wear their hair short, called croppies; the head being completely singed, a cap made of strong linen well imbued with boiling pitch was so closely put on that it could not be taken off without bringing off a part of the skin and flesh from the head : in many instances the tortured victim had one of his ears cut off to satisfy the executioner that if he escaped he could readily be discovered, being so well marked.\" \"\n\nThe torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victim's hair. The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembled scalping. In another form of torture, pitch could also be poured into a victim's orifices. However, doing so invariably proved fatal, and was therefore more suitable as a form of execution. Dating back to antiquity, this method often involved other hot liquids, even molten metal such as gold (which was used by Mithridates VI of Pontus to execute Roman consul Manius Aqullius in 88 BC. It was also rumoured that the triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus was executed in this way by the Parthians after losing the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, but this probably happened after his death.\n\n\n"}

He earned a total of 80 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team after making his debut on his 21st birthday. He is remembered for his famous penalty save from Daniel Timofte of Romania at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy during the knockout stage.\n\nCommonly known as 'Pat' or 'Packie', Bonner is a one-club player. He is also a twin.\n\nBonner played Gaelic football for Donegal at minor and seinor level in the 1970's. He played a number of games in the National Football League.\n\nHe began his career in the late 1970s with his local youth side, Keadue Rovers. When he was 16 he had several trials with Leicester City and kept goal for them in the FA Youth Cup. \nThe August of 1977, Bonner had agreed a deal to sign for League of Ireland side Finn Harps F.C. on a 6 month contract after impressing in a guest appearance in a friendly against English team Stoke City F.C.. An agreement was put in place, with then Harps manager, Eunan 'Busty' Blake, that if a bigger club came in, he would be allowed to leave and Blake himself would personally tear up his contract. He was subsequently spotted by Sean Fallon, who was scouting in Ireland for Celtic, and invited to Glasgow for a trial. True to his word, 'Busty' Blake tore up his Finn Harps contract, without ever making a competitive appearance for the club, and Bonner signed for Celtic on 14 May 1978, becoming Jock Stein's last signing for the Parkhead club.\n\nBonner went on to play 642 times for Celtic, with 483 league appearances. In total with Celtic, he won four League Championship medals, three Scottish Cup winners' medals and a League Cup winners' medal. Although he was released by manager Lou Macari in 1994, he was re-signed by Tommy Burns after Macari was sacked. His last appearance for Celtic was winning the 1995 Scottish Cup final under Burns. After the Scottish Cup Final victory over Airdrie, Bonner took on the role of player-coach and finally left the club in 1998 to work as a coach alongside former teammate Tommy Burns.\n\nWith 642 appearances, Bonner is the most prolific goalkeeper in Celtic's history and their fifth-most prolific player of all time.\n\nBonner made his international debut for the Republic of Ireland on his 21st birthday in a friendly against Poland on 24 May 1981. The game was played in Zdzisław Krzyszkowiak Stadium, Bydgoszcz. He conceded a goal in the opening 90 seconds of the match, scored by Andrzej Iwan. A David O'Leary own goal in the 37th minute and a third Polish goal in the second half from Roman Ogaza would make it a forgettable experience. For the remainder of the Eoin Hand managerial era, Bolton Wanderers Jim McDonagh remained Ireland's first choice Goalkeeper. However, by the time of the appointment of Jack Charlton in March 1986, Bonner was already claiming the number one position for Ireland. Bonner claimed his 75th international cap on his 34th birthday in a 1–0 win over Bolivia at Lansdowne Road which at the time equalled the Republic of Ireland record held by Liam Brady.\n\nBonner played in seven of Ireland's eight games in the qualifying round of UEFA Euro 1988. Despite some good results, including a 1–0 win away to Scotland, a 2–0 win at home to Bulgaria and a 2–2 draw away to World Cup bronze medalists Belgium, Ireland looked to be losing out on goal difference to Bulgaria. Bulgaria needed only a draw against Scotland in their last match to progress. However, a last-minute winning goal for Scotland gave Ireland, and Bonner, a first appearance at the UEFA European Championship.\n\nBonner played in all of Ireland's games at Euro 88, including the 1–0 victory over England in Stuttgart. Ireland scored early and dominated in the first half, missing several chances to put the game beyond England. However, in the second half, Bonner produced a number of outstanding saves to keep Ireland in the lead, most notably from Gary Lineker, and was named Man of the Match. It was Bonner's eighth consecutive clean sheet for Ireland. In the second game, Ireland drew 1–1 with the Soviet Union. Ireland narrowly missed out on a semi-final appearance, conceding a goal in the dying minutes of their final group match against eventual champions, the Netherlands.\n\nBonner missed the opening qualifying game for the 1990 FIFA World Cup away to Northern Ireland due to a back injury. However, he played in the remaining seven fixtures, with the only goals being conceded throughout the qualifying campaign coming in 0–2 loss away in Spain. Indeed, only an excellent performance by Bonner in that game saved Ireland from a heavier defeat. Ireland went on to beat Spain 1–0 in the return fixture at Lansdowne Road, and in November 1989 clinched qualification in the final fixture with a 2–0 win away over Malta.\n\nIt was the first time the Republic of Ireland had qualified for the World Cup, and Bonner would make his mark on the world stage with two memorable moments that live long in Irish sporting folklore. The first was in Ireland's very first World Cup finals game, against England. With Ireland 1–0 down late in the game, Bonner delivered a determined clearance all the way to the English penalty area, setting up Kevin Sheedy's equaliser. While Bonner's role in the goal itself was minimal, the look of sheer determination on his face has been remembered as one of the defining moments of Ireland's inaugural appearance in the tournament. After a disappointing 0–0 draw with Egypt in the second game, Ireland needed at least a draw with the Netherlands to ensure passage to the next round. With Ireland 1–0 down midway through the second half, Bonner once again delivered a clearance all the way to the Dutch penalty area, which caused enough confusion to allow Niall Quinn to slot in the equaliser and send Ireland to the knockout stage. Ireland's second round fixture against Romania went to a penalty shootout, where the score was tied at 4–4 with one kick remaining for each team. Bonner made a simple save from a poorly taken penalty by Daniel Timofte, setting up David O'Leary to score the winning Irish kick. In the quarter-final against Italy, Ireland lost 1–0 as Bonner saved a powerful shot from Roberto Donadoni, but was knocked off balance enough to allow Salvatore Schillaci to snatch the winning goal and send Ireland home. Bonner arrived home in Dublin to a hero's welcome the following day.\n\nBonner's penalty save has been remembered by FIFA as one of the great moments of that World Cup. In an article entitled \"Bonner's Moment in Time\", Bonner states, \"It really wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that that one save changed my life forever, certainly in terms of recognition.\"\n\nBonner remained Ireland's number one choice goalkeeper for UEFA Euro 1992, where Ireland was drawn against Poland, Turkey and England in the qualifying round. Ireland lost out to England in controversial circumstances. With Ireland one point behind England and tied with Poland with two games left, it was debated in the media if a draw with Poland would be better than a win. Assuming England beat Turkey on the same day, a draw left Ireland and Poland with six points each with England on eight points and all three teams having one remaining game. With England playing Poland in the last game, it meant that Poland could still qualify for the tournament by beating England and hoping Ireland failed to beat Turkey in their last game. If Poland did beat England, Ireland could then qualify on goal difference by beating Turkey. However, if instead, Ireland beat Poland in the second-last game, Poland was out of the tournament. Ireland would have seven points to England's eight, meaning that Ireland would need to beat Turkey and hope that Poland, without the prospect of qualification, could still manage a draw with England. With Ireland leading Poland 3–1 with minutes to go, Ireland conceded two late goals and the game finished 3–3.\n\nBonner represented Ireland in all 12 of their qualifying matches for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Ireland seemed well on the way to qualification after seven wins and three draws in the opening ten games. With each side having only two games remaining, Ireland led the group on 18 points, ahead of Denmark on 16, with Spain in third place on 15 points. Ireland needed only a draw at Lansdowne Road against Spain in the second last game to guarantee qualification, while a win would virtually guarantee top position in the group. However, Ireland conceded three goals in a 15-minute spell in the first half, and despite a late consolation goal, Ireland now needed to beat Northern Ireland in the last game to guarantee a place in the finals. A draw would mean Ireland needed the Spain-Denmark game, happening simultaneously, to finish in a win for one of the two sides. Ireland drew 1–1 with Northern Ireland but qualified ahead of Denmark by virtue of having scored more goals (they were level on goal difference), as Denmark lost 1–0 to Spain. Bonner's saves throughout the tournament were key to Ireland's goal-difference remaining on par with Denmark and ensuring eventual qualification.\n\nIn the Finals, Ireland beat Italy 1–0 in their opening match. The euphoria was elevated by the fact that Ireland had also beaten Germany and the Netherlands in warm-up games. However, from that point on, the tournament was a disappointment for Ireland and especially Bonner. A 2–1 defeat at the hands of Mexico and a 0–0 draw with Norway were just enough for Ireland to move into round two on the strength of their win over Italy. A 2–0 defeat to the Netherlands ended Ireland's tournament, and was a low point for Bonner. With Ireland already 1–0 down late in the first half, a long-distance effort from Wim Jonk should have been an easy save. However, Bonner fumbled the shot and it dribbled into the net. Ireland never recovered and was eliminated from the tournament.\n\nBonner struggled to maintain his place in the Ireland squad during the UEFA Euro 1996 qualification campaign, playing only one match, as captain, in a 4–0 win over Liechtenstein at Lansdowne Road. Alan Kelly played all of Ireland's other qualification matches. Ireland were eliminated 2–0 by the Netherlands in a playoff.\n\nBonner became the Republic of Ireland's most capped goalkeeper with 80 appearances for his country. He held this record until it was surpassed in 2007 by fellow Donegal native Shay Given, who by the end of 2011 had achieved 120 caps. Bonner remains a cultural icon in Ireland for his role in some of the most memorable moments in Irish sporting history, including the win over England at Euro 88, the draws with England and the Netherlands at the 1990 World Cup and, of course, the penalty save that sent Ireland to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first and, to date, only time.\n\nOn 2 February 2003, following the promotion of Brian Kerr to the position of Republic of Ireland team manager, Bonner was named as technical director of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). He previously held the role of the senior squad's goalkeeping coach in the organisation.

{"id": "1971690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971690", "title": "Recreation Park (Pittsburgh)", "text": "Recreation Park (Pittsburgh)\n\nRecreation Park was a sporting grounds and stadium located in what is today Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The stadium existed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the park's heyday, the location was considered to be within Allegheny City, but in 1907, the entire municipality was annexed by its larger neighbor and eventually became Pittsburgh's North Side.\n\nThe field was the first National League home for the Pittsburgh Pirates (at the time referred to as the Alleghenys) of Major League Baseball. It also hosted many football games of the University of Pittsburgh (at the time referred to as the Western University of Pennsylvania). In November 1892, the park was the location of the first known American football game that included a professional player.\n\nThe park left a scant pictorial record. Only one known photograph, taken from a very distant vantage point, shows the grounds in its longtime baseball configuration. It was discovered in 2015 in a time capsule left by scientific instrument maker John Brashear. A much-altered facility appears in later photos, including several newspaper shots of football games.\n\nOpened in 1865 as a skating center, the park was adapted for baseball use in 1867. Known prior to 1885 as Union Park, the stadium had an early capacity of 2,500, and was later expanded with wooden grandstands to allow up to 17,000 spectators. After the Alleghenys moved a few blocks south in 1890, the main tenant became the Allegheny Athletic Association, and the grounds would eventually be referred to as 3A Park. After the turn of the 20th century, it was converted to a velodrome called the Coliseum. The park was located within the blocks of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and Grant (now Galveston) Avenues and Boquet (now Behan) Street. In 2001, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pirates built stadiums not far from this site.\n\nIn the late 1860s and early 70s, no less than three local amateur baseball teams—the Enterprise Club, the Xanthas, and the Olympics—competed, most often at Union Park. In 1876 a professional Allegheny club played its first game against the Xantha club at Union Park, winning 7-3. This club lasted for three years, playing mostly other squads from the northeast within the International Association, but occasionally taking on National League teams in exhibition games. One long remembered match took place in early May, 1877, when Pud Galvin both threw a shutout and hit a home run for the only score in a 1-0 game against the Boston Red Stockings. The 1882-organized Pittsburgh Alleghenys of the American Association moved from Exposition Park II to Union Park in 1884. The team posted a record of 18–37 at home that season, finishing 11th in the league. In 1887, owner William A. Nimick transferred the club into the National League, and on April 30, the Alleghenies defeated the Chicago White Stockings, 6–2 in front of 10,000 spectators. This was the first officially recognized contest of the Pittsburgh Pirates franchise by the team. Legend has it that, prior to that opening game of the 1887 season, Pittsburgh's catcher Fred Carroll buried his pet monkey beneath home plate. Also during that season, a local businessman by the name of Walter Brown organized what would be an early attempt of a league for black ball players, with his Pittsburgh Keystones taking up residence at the park.<br>In 1891, after the collapse of the Pittsburgh Burghers baseball franchise and the Players' League, the Alleghenys moved to the third incarnation of Exposition Park, which had been constructed for the Burghers.\nOn November 12, 1892, the Allegheny Athletic Association football team hosted a game here against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The Allegheny Athletic Association won the game, which was the first in professional football. The team had hired Pudge Heffelfinger, an all-American guard from Yale, for $500. Decades later the Pro Football Hall of Fame discovered a page torn from an 1892 account ledger prepared by Allegheny manager, O. D. Thompson, that included the line item: \"Game performance bonus to W. Heffelfinger for playing (cash) $500.\"\n\nIn 1902, a Pirates-backed football team, the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League, played all of its home games at the field. The Stars would go on to win the league's only championship against the Philadelphia Athletics, 11-0 at the field. \nThe Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP) football team played their first game of the 1898 season at Recreation Park, defeating Westminster 5–0. Though WUP did play some games at Exposition Park as early as 1900, games were still hosted at Recreation Park until the University signed an exclusive contract with Exposition Park in 1904.\nPirates owner Barney Dreyfuss secured a lease on the park in 1901 as a preventative measure to keep the upstart American League from establishing a competing baseball franchise in Pittsburgh. Hoping also to profit from the grounds, Dreyfuss put in a modern bicycle track to be used for motor-paced races featuring the stars of the sport. Baseball umpire and boxing referee Tim Hurst was manager of the facility, which opened in May 1902 under a name variously spelled as \"Colosseum\" or \"Coliseum.\" The track, a smooth wooden oval with high bankings, encompassed a multipurpose field. Surrounding the track was newly built seating for 7,000 spectators, comprising two covered grandstands—one each on the north and south sides—and open bleachers. The venture was not long in proving a failure: Cycling did not catch on as a spectator sport, and the stadium's alternative use as a football venue was less than lucrative. No longer fearing an invasion by an opposition baseball team, Dreyfuss let the lease expire in April 1904. The track was torn down and the grounds turned back over to the owners.\n\nBeyond simply major sporting events, the park often also doubled as a venue for circuses, carnivals, various ethnic and holiday celebrations, and track meets. Prior to the evolution of the Exposition grounds for major gatherings, Union Park was a main local gathering place, sitting immediately next to the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, that could easily and closely accommodate large crowds for exhibitors. Popular national figures such as Adam Forepaugh and P. T. Barnum would often hold their shows here, spending often up to three days located at the park before moving off to other, more typical one night shows in smaller towns.\n\nRecreation Park has a reference in the city directory as late as 1914, but the open land was soon covered over by various industrial buildings, since the early 1900s.\n\n"}

It was founded in Munich, 12 October 1949.\n\nThe DGB coordinates joint demands and activities within the German trade union movement. It represents the member unions in contact with the government authorities, the political parties and the employers' organisations. However, the umbrella organisation is not directly involved in collective bargaining and does not conclude collective labour agreements.\n\nUnion delegates elect committees for 9 districts, 66 regions and the federal centre. The organisation holds a federal congress every four years. This assembly sets the framework for trade union policies and elects five Federal Executives. Together with the presidents of the member unions they constitute the DGB's executive committee. The members of the executive committee, together with the DGB regional presidents and 70 delegates from the unions, form a Federal Council which meets once a year to make decisions on national issues. The DGB also has a youth organisation, DGB-Jugend.\n\nThe DGB has its headquarters in Berlin. It is a member of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC).\n\nAs first German confederation of unions at 14 March 1892 the \"Generalkommission der Gewerkschaften Deutschlands\" was founded in Halberstadt. It represented 57 national and some local unions with approximate 300,000 people in total. After World War I unions had to reorganise. During a congress in Nuremberg from 30 June until 5 July 1919 the \"Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\" (ADGB) was founded as an umbrella organisation of 52 unions with more than 3 million members. The ADGB may be seen as predecessor of today's DGB. Like today, there also existed a conservative counterpart of lesser importance.\nCuriously, this conservative organisation was named \"Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, DGB\". On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were dissolved by the Nazis.\n\nAfter World War II German unions had to reorganize once again.\n\nOn 9–11 February 1946 the \"Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\" (\"FDGB\") was founded in Berlin as a confederation of 15 unions in the Soviet occupation zone.\n\nOn 23–25 April 1947 the \"Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, DGB\" was founded in Bielefeld as a confederation of 12 unions in the Allied-occupied Germany.\n\nFoundations in the American occupation zone:\n24/25 August 1946: Freier Gewerkschaftsbund Hessen\n30 August – 1 September 1946: Gewerkschaftsbund Württemberg-Baden\n27–29 March 1947: Bayerischer Gewerkschaftsbund\n\nFoundations in the French occupation zone:\n15/16 February 1947: Gewerkschaftsbund Süd-Württemberg und Hohenzollern\n1/2 March 1947: Badischer Gewerkschaftsbund\n2 May 1947: Allgemeiner Gewerkschaftsbund Rheinland-Pfalz\n\nOn 12–14 October, the 7 umbrella organisation in West Germany merged into the West German DGB as a confederation of 16 single trade unions.\n\nIn 1990, the members of the FDGB of the German Democratic Republic joined the members of the DGB. In recent years, many member unions of the DGB have merged, so today the DGB has only 8 members. This was seen as a progress by many unionists who hoped for stronger representation, while others claim that strong member unions like ver.di with its two million members have considerably weakened the DGB as a roof organization.\n\nIn general, the influence of German trade unions has declined since 1990 and had to accept shrinking real incomes and a reform of the welfare system in 2004 (\"Hartz IV laws\"), which put additional pressure on wages. For some years, the DGB and its member unions have been campaigning for a minimum wage to be introduced in Germany. Well into the 1990s, they had rejected this idea because they got better results from their strong position in the German system of collective bargaining.\n\nIn 1978 the Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP, see above) joined the DGB as 17th union.\n\nThe Deutsche Angestellten Gewerkschaft – DAG – was a large white collar trade union.\nAlthough the DAG in the British zone 1946 was a member of the DGB in the British zone,\nthe West German DAG never joined the West German DGB as a single member union.\nBut in 2001 the DAG merged with four existing DGB unions to become the new DGB union ver.di.\n\nThe railway unionVerkehrsgewerkschaft GDBA was a member of the German Civil Service Federation.\nIn 2010 the GDBA merged with existing DGB union TRANSNET to the new DGB union EVG.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1971714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971714", "title": "Chrysler Hemi engine", "text": "Chrysler Hemi engine\n\nThe Chrysler Hemi engines, known by the trademark Hemi, are a series of I6 and V8 gasoline engines built by Chrysler with hemispherical combustion chambers. Three different types of Hemi engines have been built by Chrysler for automobiles: the first (known as the Chrysler FirePower engine) from 1951 to 1958, the second from 1964 to 1971, and the third beginning in 2003. Although Chrysler is most identified with the use of \"Hemi\" as a marketing term, many other auto manufacturers have incorporated similar designs.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Chrysler also used the \"Hemi\" name for their Australian-made Hemi-6 Engine and applied it to the 4-cylinder Mitsubishi 2.6L engine installed in various North American market vehicles.\nA hemispherical cylinder head (\"hemi-head\") gives an efficient combustion chamber with an excellent surface-to-volume ratio, with minimal heat loss to the head, and allows for two large valves. However, a hemi-head allows no more than two valves per cylinder, and these large valves are necessarily heavier than in a multi-valve engine. The intake and exhaust valves lie on opposite sides of the chamber and necessitate a \"cross-flow\" head design. Since the combustion chamber is a partial hemisphere, a flat-topped piston would yield too low a compression ratio unless a very long stroke is used, so to attain desired compression ratio the piston crown is domed to protrude into the head at top dead center, resulting in a combustion chamber in the shape of the thick peel of half an orange.\n\nThe hemi-head design places the spark plug at or near the center of the chamber to promote a strong flame front. However, if the hemi-head hemisphere is of equal diameter to the piston, there is minimal squish for proper turbulence to mix fuel and air thoroughly. Thus, hemi-heads, because of their lack of squish, are more sensitive to fuel octane rating; a given compression ratio will require a higher octane rating to avoid pre-detonation in a hemi engine than in some conventional engine designs such as the wedge and bathtub.\n\nThe hemi head always has intake and exhaust valve stems that point in different directions, requiring a large, wide cylinder head and complex rocker arm geometry in both cam-in-block and single overhead cam engines (dual overhead cam engines may not have rocker arms). This adds to the overall width of the engine, limiting the vehicles in which it can be installed.\n\nSignificant challenges in the commercialization of engine designs utilizing hemispherical chambers revolved around the valve actuation, specifically how to make it effective, efficient, and reliable at an acceptable cost. This complexity was referenced early in Chrysler's development of their 1950s hemi engine: the head was referred to in company advertising as the \"Double Rocker Shaft\" head.\n\nChrysler developed their first experimental hemi engine for the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft. The XIV-2220 engine was an inverted V16 rated at . The P-47 was already in production with a Pratt & Whitney radial engine when the XIV-2220 flew successfully in trials in 1945 as a possible upgrade, but the war was winding down and it did not go into production. However, the exercise gave Chrysler engineers valuable research and development experience with two-valve hemi combustion chamber dynamics and parameters.\n\nIn addition to the aircraft engine, Chrysler and Continental worked together to develop the air-cooled AV-1790-5B V12 Hemi engine used in the M47 Patton tank.\n\nChrysler applied their military experience with the hemispherical combustion chamber to their first overhead-valve V8 engine, released under the name FirePower, not \"Hemi,\" in 1950 for the 1951 model year. The first version of the FirePower engine had a displacement of and produced . Eventually, three of the four Chrysler divisions had its own version of the FirePower engine, with different displacements and designations, and having almost no parts in common. This lack of commonality was due in part to the three engine versions using different bore pitches (the center-to-center distance between adjacent cylinders). Chrysler and Imperial called their versions the \"FirePower\". DeSoto called theirs the \"FireDome\". Dodge had a smaller version, known as the \"Red Ram\". Only Plymouth didn't have a version, instead retaining the Dodge poly-head engines: there was no Plymouth hemi engine until the 1964 426.\nBriggs Cunningham used the Chrysler version in some of his race cars for international motor sports. A Chrysler-powered Cunningham C5-R won its class in 1953. Cunningham switched away from these designs in 1959 when Chrysler temporarily abandoned the hemispherical concept in favor of the wedge-head B engine until 1964.\n\nCollectively, the 1951-'58 Hemi engines are now commonly referred to as first-generation Hemi engines, and the group can be identified by the rear-mounted distributor and the spark plugs in a row down the center of wide valve covers.\n\n1951 Plymouth Hemi V6\n\nThere were plans in 1951 for a Plymouth Dual Overhead Cam Hemi V6 displacing 235 Cubic Inches designed by Chrysler's Powerplant Research and Engine Design division. It was meant to be a powerful, fuel efficient alternative to Ford's V8 and to replace Plymouth's venerable flathead 6.\nThe Plans were scrapped due to build costs and because of the then unusual design. \n\nAll Chrysler FirePower engines are oversquare; i.e their bore is larger than their stroke.\n\nThis first FirePower engine, used from 1951 to 1955, has a bore of 3.8125 in and a stroke of 3.625 in for a piston displacement of , and a deck height of 10.32\" (\"low deck\"). The bore pitch, shared by all Chrysler FirePower engines, was 4.5625\", the largest of any 1st generation hemi engines. Most used a two-barrel carburetor and produced , with the famous exception of the 1955 Chrysler C-300 equipped with dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors and rated at 300 hp. \n\nThe 331 engine was used in the following applications:\n\nThe 354, released in 1956, had a bore of 3.9375 in and stroke of 3.625 in, and the same 10.32\" low deck height. The 300B engine was rated at , while the New Yorker and Imperial 354 engine configuration produced . For the 300B an optional version was available, making it the first American V-8 to be rated at one horsepower per cubic inch. Note that was before 1972, horsepower was SAE gross. After 1972, horsepower is SAE net.\nThe 354 was also modified. The hemi was optimized for heavy-duty truck service. These were available with one or two four-barrel carburetors, and were offered in Dodge's heaviest duty models as the 'Power Giant V-8' from 1957 through 1959; they were the largest of four hemi truck engines offered by Dodge in the 1950s. The 354 was also offered in certain models with polyspheric heads rather than hemi heads. The combustion chambers on these had similarities to both hemi and wedge heads, but were closer in weight to wedge heads. Thus, both 354 poly and 354 hemi V-8 engines were variously available in 1957.\n\nThe 354 engine was used in the following applications:\n\nThe 392 raised-deck engine released in 1957 had a bore and stroke. The actual displacement is . The deck height, at , was taller than that of the previous blocks. Because its deck was taller, the heads were cast with wider intake ports so that earlier manifolds could be used with the new heads on the new taller block. For 1958, Chrysler offered the 392 in two configurations: with 9.25:1 compression and with 10:1 compression, both with a single four-barrel carburetor. A dual four-barrel version of the 392 available in the 1957-58 Chrysler 300C & 300D cars was rated at ; the 300D, and some marine and industrial engines, used a (now rare) adjustable rocker. An extremely rare option available on the 1958 300D was Bendix \"Electrojector\" fuel injection, with which the 392 was rated at . Due to reliability problems with the primitive onboard computer which controlled the injection system, however, 15 of the 16 300D cars built with the fuel injection option were recalled and retrofitted with carburetors.\n\nThe 392 engine was used in the following applications:\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, drag racers found the 392 to be a formidable engine and continued to run them competitively into the 1970s. Usual color of the block was silver.\n\nDeSoto's Hemi engines were called Fire Dome.\n\nIn 1952, DeSoto introduced its version of the FirePower with a bore of and stroke of , for a displacement of . The bore pitch, shared by all DeSoto FirePower engines, was . Power output was . It was a hot seller, with 50,000 vehicles using the engine until it was replaced in 1954.\n\nAn increase in displacement to was made for 1955 by increasing the bore to .\n\nThe DeSoto engine was enlarged for 1956 to . Bore was the same as the 291 at , but stroke was increased to and a taller (raised-deck) block was used.\n\nDisplacement was increased again for 1956 (DeSoto Adventurer only) and 1957 (Firedome and Fireflite models) to . Bore was now with stroke remaining at . The DeSoto Adventurer produced using dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors—more than one horsepower per cubic inch.\nThe 1956 DeSoto Adventurer was the premiere named high-performance version—the DeSoto equivalent of the Chrysler 300—using dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors.\nThe Adventurer engine for 1956 used a displacement of 341 CID (3.78\" bore by 3.80\" stroke) and had a compression ratio of 9.5:1, using a special hydraulic camshaft profile.\n\nThe largest DeSoto engine for 1957 was the DeSoto Adventurer offering with square bore and stroke dimensions of 3.80 inches. The DeSoto Adventurer used dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors for a rating of , again producing one horsepower per cubic inch utilizing a similar intake manifold to the 1956 341 Adventurer and a similar camshaft. Compression ratio remained at 9.5:1.\n\nDodge's Hemi was introduced in 1953 as the Red Ram. Dodge did not have a V8 engine until one was developed specifically for the line in 1953 based on the 1951 Chrysler hemi design, but down-sized for these smaller cars. They have the smallest bore center distance of any hemi engine at . They do not share any major dimensions or components with the larger Chrysler and DeSoto hemi engines, or the Plymouth A engines. From 1955 to 1958 (see 1956 D500 Dodge D-500 cars and packages: early performance cars)lower performance versions of the Dodge hemi were introduced by substituting less complex poly (single rocker shaft) heads and valve train parts, including one variant only built as a poly (259\"). These were used in low-line 1955-58 DeSotos and Dodges, and 1955-56 high-line Plymouths.\n\nDodge Trucks marketed their version of the Hemi under the name PowerDome \n\nDodge introduced the engine in 1953. Bore was and stroke was . With a low compression ratio of 7.0:1 (in 1953 and for the 1954 Meadowbrook), the 241 produced . For 1954, the more senior Dodges received thanks to a higher 7.5:1 compression ratio. This engine is not the same as the Plymouth 241, which had polyspheric, not hemi heads. The 241 only lasted two years, being replaced by the 270 for 1955.\n\nThe D553 1955/1956 Dodge Red Ram Hemi 270 displaced and was used in premium 1955 and 1956 Dodge vehicles. Bore was and stroke was . It was not the same as the 270 poly-head. In the Dodge Coronet, running 7.6:1 compression ratio, the 270 produced . In higher trims like the Dodge Royal, the \"Super Red Ram\" ran the same compression ratio but with a four-barrel carburetor produced .\n\nFor 1956, Dodge increased the displacement to with a longer stroke and a taller raised-deck block and now with a polyspheric heads—no longer a Hemi. But the optional high-performance D-500 version of this engine had a four-barrel carburetor and a larger valved Dodge hemispherical combustion chambered head. Also, a \"race only\" package called the D-500-1 or DASH 1 was available with a special aluminum dual four barrel intake that sported a pair of Carter WCFB carburetors similar to the ones on the Chrysler 300B and DeSoto Adventurer. This engine utilized the same cylinders heads as the base D-500 model.\n\nThe D-501 in 57 was the Chrysler 354 engine, not a Dodge-based engine.\n\nDodge released a engine for 1957. The engine used a bore and stroke.\nThe base engine offering was now a polyspheric chambered head referenced as 'KDS', and a higher performance 325 was offered with hemi heads as the 'KD-500'. Again there was a low volume offering of a 'KD-500-1' with dual four barrel carburetors. All engines now, however, had hydraulic camshafts even though the hemi headed offerings sported \"dimples\" in the valve covers for mechanical adjuster clearance.\n\nThe hemispherical head design was revived in 1964. These were the first engines officially designated Hemi, a name Chrysler had trademarked. Chrysler Hemi engines of this generation displaced . Just 11,000 Hemi engines were ultimately produced for consumer sale due to their relatively high cost and the sheer size of the engine bay required to fit it in. The 426 Hemi was nicknamed the \"elephant engine\" at the time, a reference to its high power, heavy weight and large physical dimensions. Its deck height and bore spacing made it the biggest engine in racing at the time.\n\nThe 426 Hemi of the 1960s was an engine produced for use in NASCAR, used in a racing version of a Plymouth Belvedere in 1964. It was not initially available to the general buying public. The 426 Hemi was not allowed to compete in NASCAR's 1965 season due to its unavailability in production vehicles sold to the general public and because of complaints by Ford regarding its power. However several special production cars were produced and sold with the 426 Hemi. These were the Dodge Dart and Plymouth Fury later in 1965 included the Dodge Coronet and included aluminum fenders and bumpers for drag racing. However they were sold to the general public. Chrysler introduced the \"Street\" Hemi in 1966 for its intermediate range of cars and sold the required number of Hemi engines to the public to legitimize its use for NASCAR in 1966. The \"Street Hemi\" was the similar to the race Hemi but with an inline 2X4-bbl induction system (with automatic choke), lower compression (10.25:1 from 12.5:1) and lower-lift camshaft, with iron exhaust manifolds instead of lighter steel long tube headers.\n\nAlthough all manufacturers were familiar with multi-valve engines and hemispherical combustion chambers, adding more valves per cylinder, or designing the complex valvetrain needed for a hemispherical chamber were expensive ways of improving the high–revolutions per minute (rpm) breathing of production vehicles. By canting the angle of the NASCAR-mandated two valves per cylinder, significantly larger valves could be used. The Chrysler 426 Hemi and all Chrysler RBs had oversquare bore and strokes. Specifically, the 426 Hemi and 426 Wedge had a bore x stroke of .\n\nThe 426 Hemi also was used in NHRA and AHRA drag racing. Its large casting allowed the engine to be overbored and stroked to displacements unattainable in the other engines of the day. Top-fuel racing organizers limited the bore spacing of engines until very recently, when under pressure from Ford and other manufacturers, the bore spacing allowed was increased to —this allows other engines such as the Ford 385 series to begin to compete. The engines based on the old Chrysler design predominate Top Fuel and Funny Car classes due to plentiful parts, large amount of research and development, as well as decades of experience with the problems of the engine's design. In drag racing today, the engine bears little resemblance to any engine produced by Chrysler; it is usually equipped with a large Roots type supercharger and short individual exhaust pipes, and fueled with nitromethane. Yet, this variant is used in Top Fuel, Funny Car, and Pro Modified classes.\n\nThe 426 Hemi, in \"street Hemi\" form, was produced for consumer automobiles from 1965 through 1971. There were many differences between the Hemi and the Wedge-head big-block, including main cross-bolted bearing caps and a different head bolt pattern. There were also many differences between the racing Hemi's and the street Hemi, including but not limited to compression ratio, camshaft, intake manifold, exhaust manifold. Some 1960s NASCAR and NHRA Hemi engines featured magnesium cross-ram intake manifolds and magnesium oil pans in an attempt to reduce the massive weight of the overall engine, along with chain-driven internal dry sump oil systems. Today, aftermarket blocks, heads, intakes, rods and pistons are usually made of aluminum.\n\nThe street Hemi version was rated at at 5000 rpm SAE gross and at 4000 rpm of torque equipped with a pair of four-barrel Carter AFB carburetors. In actual dynamometer testing, it produced and of torque in purely stock form. Chrysler's sales literature published both the gross and net ratings for 1971.\n\nTo avoid confusion with earlier (1951–58) and current Hemi engines, the 426 is sometimes called the \"2G\" or \"Gen 2\" Hemi.\n\nThe street version of the 2G Hemi engine was used (optionally, in all but the last case) in the following vehicles:\n\nHemi-powered Dodge and Plymouth cars produced in the model years of 1965 through 1971 have become collector's items. For example, a 1971 Plymouth Barracuda Convertible equipped with the 426 Hemi engine sold at auction for US$3.5 million in 2014.\n\nThe current-production \"HEMI\" engine heads are flatter and more complex than the 1950s–'70s Hemi V8 chamber. The combustion chambers are no longer truly hemispherical. It uses a coil-on-plug distributorless ignition system and two spark plugs per cylinder to shorten flame travel leading to more consistent combustion and reduced emissions. Like most of Chrysler's past-model Hemi-head engines, the 5.7 version is rated at approximately one horsepower per cubic inch (the current engines are SAE net, whereas the old Hemi engines were rated SAE gross). For the 2009 model year power was increased to 357-395 horsepower (266-291 kW) and 389-410 lb·ft (527-556 N·m) depending on application. It also achieved 4% better fuel economy. Variable valve timing (VVT) was also introduced.\n\nA new variable displacement technology called Multi-Displacement System (MDS) is used in some versions which can shut off two cylinders on each bank under light load to improve fuel economy.\n\nThe 5.7 L HEMI was released for model year 2003 on the Dodge Ram 1500, 2500, and 3500 pickup trucks to complement the Magnum 5.9 engine. it was the only available gasoline engine in the Ram Heavy Duty. Chrysler later made the 5.7 L Hemi available in all models of the 2004 Dodge Ram, Dodge Durango, the 2005 Chrysler 300C, Dodge Magnum R/T, Jeep Grand Cherokee, the 2006 Dodge Charger R/T, Jeep Commander, the 2007 Chrysler Aspen, and the 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T. For manual transmission applications (Challenger and 3/4- and 1-ton Ram pickups), cylinder deactivation is not included.\n\nThe Hemi in the Ram delivered and , but and for the 300C and Magnum R/T, which is exactly more than the old 5.9 engine. It is a 90-degree V8, 2-valve pushrod design like the past Magnum series engines, displacing , with a bore of and a stroke of .\n\nThe 5.7 L Hemi is made at Chrysler's Saltillo Engine plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico.\n\nThe Hemi was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 2003 through 2007, and again in 2009.\n\nThis engine is used in the following vehicles:\n\nChrysler has made various revisions to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable Camshaft Timing or VCT. VCT (which is essentially variable valve timing) uses an oil control valve which controls oil flow to a unique camshaft sprocket which contains a phasing device, which depending on the operation of the oil control valve either advances or retards camshaft timing.\n\nCylinder heads have been revised to increase flow. Though the intake manifold has also been changed on all applications, it is however model specific. Dodge Ram, non-Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Chrysler Aspens, and non-HEV Dodge Durango utilize an active intake manifold with a short runner valve to optimize torque and horsepower. At lower engine rpm the valve is closed, resulting in improved low-end torque from the longer runners. At higher engine rpm the valve is opened, diverting the incoming air into the center of the manifold. The shorter runners results in improved horsepower. Passenger cars, Jeep vehicles, as well as HEV Chrysler Aspen and HEV Dodge Durango do not use this manifold; instead, these vehicles utilize a passive intake manifold, which does not have a short runner valve.\n\nSix-speed manual transmission and all Heavy Duty truck applications will differ by not having the Multi-Displacement System (MDS). The new version of the 5.7L has five different camshaft profiles. All will have VCT.\n\nPower Numbers \n\nThe Hemi is also available in a version. The engine's bore x stroke is and many other changes were made to allow it to produce at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm. The engine block is different from the 5.7, with revised coolant channels and oil jets to cool the pistons. A forged crankshaft, lighter pistons and strengthened connecting rods aid durability. A cast aluminium intake manifold is tuned for high-rpm power and does not include variable-length technology. Chrysler's Multi-Displacement System is not used on the 6.1.\n\nApplications:\n\nFor 2015, Chrysler introduced an all-new high performance supercharged variant of the Hemi engine, called the Hellcat (named after the Grumman F6F Hellcat). It features the same bore as the 6.4 L Hemi and the same stroke as the 5.7 L, giving it a total displacement of . The supercharger is a twin-screw IHI unit with integrated charge coolers, capable of producing of boost. This engine is rated at at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm of torque and has a compression ratio of 9.5:1. This engine was the most powerful engine produced by Chrysler as well as the most powerful production engine \"ever\" in a muscle car until the Dodge Demon was introduced. This engine is not equipped with Chrysler's Multi-Displacement System. In 2017, Mopar announced that it would sell it as a crate engine under the name Hellcrate. For 2019 Redeye version with 797 Horsepower is available in the Dodge Challenger.\n\nApplications:\n\nThe Demon version of the Hemi V8 features a number of improvements over the Hellcat variant. It is fitted with a larger, 2.7 litre twin-screw supercharger, as well as reinforced reciprocating components, a new camshaft, and several other valvetrain upgrades. With these improvements, the Challenger SRT Demon is rated at 808 horsepower on 91-octane pump gasoline, and 840 horsepower when running on 100-octane unleaded racing gasoline. Cooling is aided by a functional Air-Grabber hood scoop, as well as a unique charge cooling system which makes use of the air-conditioning coolant to lower the intake charge air temperature. High-speed launches are assisted by a factory line-lock system, which allows the car to perform a burnout to warm the rear tires, the first transmission brake to be installed in a production car, and the Torque Reserve Launch System.\n\nApplications:\n\nChrysler displayed a larger and more powerful 392\n-cubic-inch (6.4 L) HEMI in 2005 with a conservative factory-rated output of and torque. It is equipped with high-strength forged aluminium alloy pistons. This engine has been available since 2007, as a crate under the name 392 HEMI.\n\nThe production version of the 392 HEMI was launched in the 2011 Dodge Challenger SRT8 with variable camshaft timing as well as MDS in cars with automatic transmissions. The new 392 HEMI, codenamed \"Apache,\" is based on the third-generation 5.7L HEMI, codenamed \"Eagle,\" and shares few parts with the 392 crate engine.\n\nIn late 2009 Chrysler has said the new engine will be available in the next generation SRT8 Dodge Charger, Chrysler 300, and Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nSpecial-Edition Chargers and Challengers equipped with this engine, and the engines themselves, will bear \"392 HEMI\" badging in commemorative reference to the First-Generation HEMI Engine of the same piston displacement. In other applications, the engine is badged as \"6.4L HEMI\".\nOutput is and ; \n\nFor the 2015 model year, horsepower was increased by 15, to and , in the Charger and Challenger \"SRT 392\" (2015-2018) and \"R/T Scat Pack\" (2015-Present) Models; the Grand Cherokee SRT only saw a 5 bhp increase. \n\nThe Chrysler 300 SRT (Overseas) still remained the same Horsepower and Torque as the 2012-2014 Model Years. \n\nThis engine is available in both the Dodge Charger and Challenger SRT 392 (2015-2018), including R/T Scat Pack Models (Chrysler's Main Affiliated Trim Models not related to the SRT Division) The Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, The Dodge Durango SRT (2018-Present), and the Chrysler 300 SRT (Available in Overseas Markets from 2015-Present).\n\nIn 2014, Chrysler chose to change the SRT8 moniker to SRT, removing the 8 which was a cylinder quantity nomenclature. From thereon, this was put into effect for all SRT models from all of Chrysler's divisions.\n\nStarting in model year 2014, the Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks, and Ram 3500, 4500, and 5500 Cab Chassis offered a revised version of the 6.4L, being re-tuned for better fuel economy and a power band more suitable for hauling and towing than the all-out power of the SRT Version. In 2016 it replaced the 5.7L as the standard gas engine in the Cab Chassis models.\n\nPower Numbers \n\nAt the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Dodge debuted a Mopar Customized Dodge Charger \"Redline\" that featured a modern 426-cubic-inch (7.0 L) HEMI V8 engine rated at .\n\nDuring February to April 2005, DaimlerChrysler hosted a \"What Can You HEMI?\" contest promoting alternative uses of the HEMI engines. The top five finalists include HEMI Snowblower, HEMI-Go-Round carousel, HEMI on Ice ice resurfacer, HEMI-Shredder, HEMI Big Wheel, i.e. the child's tricycle of the 1970s. The winner was the HEMI Big Wheel, which had a 5.7 L HEMI in the back that was installed backwards, thus reverse became the only forward gear. Plate steel was the predominant material, while a rolled tube of steel had to be utilized for the front tire as there were no such tires in diameter that were as narrow as needed for this project.\n\n"}

In 1949 the football federations came together and requested FIFA to launch the competition. European clubs could not afford hefty travel costs so competition was staged at the end of every season in a single host country. The competition featured two semi-finals, a third place play-off and a final.\n\nThis competition is considered a predecessor of club tournaments in Europe, such as UEFA Champions League, which first edition was held in 1955.\n\nThe tournament began in 1949 and was usually played between the league champions of each of the participating countries. Every four years, a ranking would be determined for the countries based on their sides' performances in the Latin Cup. The competition was last played for in 1957, two years after the introduction of the UEFA-sanctioned European Cup. Real Madrid played in and won both the European Cup and the Latin Cup in 1957.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the European Cup, the Latin Cup was considered the most important cup for clubs in Europe, the longer-established Mitropa Cup having gone into decline after World War II. The Latin Cup has been described one of the forerunners \"of the European Cup\" by UEFA.\n\nAccording to Jules Rimet, 3rd President of FIFA, the Latin Cup was a competition created by FIFA at request of the four nations that contested it, but its regulation was made by a committee composed of members from the competing federations, and FIFA did not participate actively in its organisation.\n\nThe Latin Cup was based on cycles of 4 years, being held in one country each year. The champion of each edition achieved the most points (4) to its Federation while teams placed 2nd, 3rd and 4th received 3, 2 and 1 points respectively. Because of that, the Copa Latina was a Federation competition rather than an annual club competition. Moreover, the Federation which totalised the most points every four years received the trophy, while the champion club was given a smaller replica of it.\n\nThe first edition was opened on 20 June 1949, with the Sporting CP vs Torino at Chamartín Stadium of Madrid. One month before 18 of Torino players had died at Superga air disaster. Barcelona would be the first champion of the tournament after beating Sporting 2–1 at the final.\n\nThe second edition clashed with 1950 FIFA World Cup of Brazil so most of the players of league champions were called up by their respective national teams. Therefore, Lazio, the fourth of Serie A, participated in Copa Latina that year. Due to a fixture clash with the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland, no Latin Cup was held that year (the participants would have been Real Madrid, Sporting CP, Lille OSC and Inter Milan - the latter did not get another chance to enter).\n\nAfter the first four editions played, the Spanish Federation won the first cycle totalising 12 points, 8 of them contributed by Barcelona and 4 by Atlético Madrid.\n\nMany were the big stars who played in the prestigious Latin Cup and some of them are listed below per tournament:<br>\n1949: Portuguese topscorer Fernando Peyroteo for Sporting Lisbon, goalkeeper Antoni Ramallets, Estanislau Basora for Barcelona, Robert Jonquet for Stade de Reims.

Many sources place its origin in the early 20th century, while some claim an earlier origin. In April 2007, William Safire promoted a search to unearth its origins.\n\nFour slightly different usages for \"fall guy\" survive and their origins are probably different. These usages are:\n\n\nThe phrase may have multiple, separate origins. Criminal usage goes back to the original sense of \"felon\" (derived from fallen, morally).\n\n\nVarious sources attribute the origin of fall guy to Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot. This has been largely discredited.\n\nOne popular myth is that the word's origin dates to the 1920s, during the administration of U.S. President Warren G. Harding (1921–1923), when Albert B. Fall, a U.S. Senator from New Mexico who served as Secretary of the Interior during Harding's years in office, became notorious for his involvement in the infamous Teapot Dome Scandal. Though this is a popular story, references to 'fall guy' and Albert Fall have not been found. The book \"The Tempest Over Teapot Dome\" contains no references to \"fall guy\". A \"Time\" article from the period makes no reference to \"fall guys\", although the scandal may have had yet to fully play out. However, this event may have popularized the phrase (via post-hoc eponymy).\n\nLegitimization occurred in the 1940s, primarily with the meaning of \"take on work/responsibility\". A paper on \"Isolationism is not dead\" quotes an anonymous editorial from a paper in the Pacific Northwest on the topic of the Bretton Woods and the Food Conferences upon which the US became the \"fall guy, the one to carry the load\". By 1950 in the context of unions and industrial society, the term referred to the low man on the totem pole, to whom the unpleasant tasks would be assigned, specifically that of filling out questionnaires.\n\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, \"fall guy\" came to mean public \"whipping boy\" in the abstract, metaphorical sense. In a 1960 paper called the \"Politics of Pollution\", Robert Bulard writes public officials, to deflect criticism over landfills, found a \"fall guy\", but they blamed abstract, faceless bodies: \"the federal government, state governments and private disposal companies\" rather than an individual. Other abstract 'fall guys' included the railroad and bank capital. Use of the political \"fall guy\" is exemplified in the following three events:\n\nIn corporate managerial classes, by 1988 the \"fall guy\" was institutionalized as a principle, a component of what every good manager needed.\n\nA few examples of fall guys:\n\n\n"}

It was produced by ITC Entertainment and first broadcast in 1969.\n\nAdam Strange, a retired Home Office criminologist, solves bizarre cases with the help of Hamlyn Gynt (Kaz Garas), Evelyn McClean (Anneke Wills) and sometimes Professor Marks (Charles Lloyd-Pack). He employs the latest techniques in forensic investigation, which he undertakes in his own laboratory in his flat in Warwick Crescent in the Maida Vale/Little Venice area of London.\n\nUnlike other ITC productions, which were created in order to be sold to the U.S. market, \"Strange Report\" was created in collaboration with NBC's films unit Arena in the United States (the show's executive producer was Norman Felton, better known for his involvement in \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\"); the suggestion was that the first half of the series would take place in the United Kingdom, and the second half would see Strange visiting the United States. This idea could not be agreed upon, which explains why such a short season of episodes was created.

{"id": "1971750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971750", "title": "Secretary problem", "text": "Secretary problem\n\nThe secretary problem is a problem that demonstrates a scenario involving optimal stopping theory. The problem has been studied extensively in the fields of applied probability, statistics, and decision theory. It is also known as the marriage problem, the sultan's dowry problem, the fussy suitor problem, the googol game, and the best choice problem.\n\nThe basic form of the problem is the following: imagine an administrator who wants to hire the best secretary out of formula_1 rankable applicants for a position. The applicants are interviewed one by one in random order. A decision about each particular applicant is to be made immediately after the interview. Once rejected, an applicant cannot be recalled. During the interview, the administrator gains information sufficient to rank the applicant among all applicants interviewed so far, but is unaware of the quality of yet unseen applicants. The question is about the optimal strategy (stopping rule) to maximize the probability of selecting the best applicant. If the decision can be deferred to the end, this can be solved by the simple maximum selection algorithm of tracking the running maximum (and who achieved it), and selecting the overall maximum at the end. The difficulty is that the decision must be made immediately.\n\nThe shortest rigorous proof known so far is provided by the odds algorithm (Bruss 2000). It implies that the optimal win probability is always at least formula_2 (where \"e\" is the base of the natural logarithm), and that the latter holds even in a much greater generality (2003). The optimal stopping rule prescribes always rejecting the first formula_3 applicants that are interviewed and then stopping at the first applicant who is better than every applicant interviewed so far (or continuing to the last applicant if this never occurs). Sometimes this strategy is called the formula_2 stopping rule, because the probability of stopping at the best applicant with this strategy is about formula_2 already for moderate values of formula_1. One reason why the secretary problem has received so much attention is that the optimal policy for the problem (the stopping rule) is simple and selects the single best candidate about 37% of the time, irrespective of whether there are 100 or 100 million applicants.\n\nAlthough there are many variations, the basic problem can be stated as follows:\n\n\nA \"candidate\" is defined as an applicant who, when interviewed, is better than all the applicants interviewed previously. \"Skip\" is used to mean \"reject immediately after the interview\". Since the objective in the problem is to select the single best applicant, only candidates will be considered for acceptance. The \"candidate\" in this context corresponds to the concept of record in permutation.\n\nThe optimal policy for the problem is a stopping rule. Under it, the interviewer rejects the first \"r\" − 1 applicants (let applicant \"M\" be the best applicant among these \"r\" − 1 applicants), and then selects the first subsequent applicant that is better than applicant \"M\". It can be shown that the optimal strategy lies in this class of strategies. (Note that we should never choose an applicant who is not the best we have seen so far, since they cannot be the best overall applicant.) For an arbitrary cutoff \"r\", the probability that the best applicant is selected is\n\nThe sum is not defined for \"r\" = 1, but in this case the only feasible policy is to select the first applicant, and hence \"P\"(1) = 1/\"n\". This sum is obtained by noting that if applicant \"i\" is the best applicant, then it is selected if and only if the best applicant among the first \"i\" − 1 applicants is among the first \"r\" − 1 applicants that were rejected. Letting \"n\" tend to infinity, writing formula_8 as the limit of \"(r-1)\"/\"n\", using \"t\" for \"(i-1)\"/\"n\" and \"dt\" for 1/\"n\", the sum can be approximated by the integral\n\nTaking the derivative of \"P\"(\"x\") with respect to formula_8, setting it to 0, and solving for \"x\", we find that the optimal \"x\" is equal to 1/\"e\". Thus, the optimal cutoff tends to \"n\"/\"e\" as \"n\" increases, and the best applicant is selected with probability 1/\"e\".\n\nFor small values of \"n\", the optimal \"r\" can also be obtained by standard dynamic programming methods. The optimal thresholds \"r\" and probability of selecting the best alternative \"P\" for several values of \"n\" are shown in the following table.\n\nThe probability of selecting the best applicant in the classical secretary problem converges toward formula_11.\n\nThis problem and several modifications can be solved (including the proof of optimality) in a straightforward manner by the Odds algorithm (2000), which also has other applications. Modifications for the secretary problem that can be solved by this algorithm include random availabilities of applicants, more general hypotheses for applicants to be of interest to the decision maker, group interviews for applicants, as well as certain models for a random number of applicants.\n\nThe solution of the secretary problem is only meaningful if it is justified to assume that the applicants have no knowledge of the decision strategy employed, because early applicants have no chance at all and may not show up otherwise.\n\nThere are also numerous other assumptions involved in the problem that restrict its applicability in modeling real employment decisions. For one, it is rarely the case that hiring the second-best applicant is as bad as hiring the worst. For another, it is also rare that interviewing an applicant gives perfect information on how they rank with respect to the previous applicants, but leaves the interviewer without a clue as to whether they are likely better than the remaining ones.\n\nOne important drawback for applications of the solution of the classical secretary problem is that the number of applicants formula_12 must be known in advance, which is rarely the case. One way to overcome this problem is to suppose that the number of applicants is a random variable formula_13 with a known distribution of formula_14 (Presman and Sonin, 1972). For this model, the optimal solution is in general much harder, however. Moreover, the optimal success probability is now no longer around 1/\"e\" but typically lower. This can be understood in the context of having a \"price\" to pay for not knowing the number of applicants. However, in this model the price is high. Depending on the choice of the distribution of formula_15, the optimal win probability can approach zero. Looking for ways to cope with this new problem led to a new model yielding the so-called 1/e-law of best choice.\n\nThe essence of the model is based on the idea that life is sequential and that real-world problems pose themselves in real time. Also, it is easier to estimate times in which specific events (arrivals of applicants) should occur more frequently (if they do) than to estimate the distribution of the number of specific events which will occur. This idea led to the following approach, the so-called \"unified approach\" (1984):\n\nThe model is defined as follows: An applicant must be selected on some time interval formula_16 from an unknown number formula_17 of rankable applicants. The goal is to maximize the probability of selecting only the best under the hypothesis that all arrival orders of different ranks are equally likely. Suppose that all applicants have the same, but independent to each other, arrival time density formula_18 on formula_16 and let formula_20 denote the corresponding arrival time distribution function, that is\n\nLet formula_23 be such that formula_24 Consider the strategy to wait and observe all applicants up to time formula_25 and then to select, if possible, the first candidate after time formula_25 which is better than all preceding ones. Then this strategy, called \"1/e-strategy\", has the following properties:\n\nThe \"1/e-strategy\"\n\nThe 1/e-law, proved in 1984 by F. Thomas Bruss, came as a surprise. The reason was that a value of about 1/e had been considered before as being out of reach in a model for unknown formula_28, whereas this value 1/e was now achieved as a lower bound for the success probability, and this in a model with arguably much weaker hypotheses (see e.g. Math. Reviews 85:m).\n\nThe 1/e-law is sometimes confused with the solution for the classical secretary problem described above because of the similar role of the number 1/e. However, in the 1/e-law, this role is more general. The result is also stronger, since it holds for an unknown number of applicants and since the model based on an arrival time distribution F is more tractable for applications.\n\nAccording to , the secretary problem appeared for the first time in print when it was featured by Martin Gardner in his February 1960 Mathematical Games column in \"Scientific American\". Here is how Gardner formulated it: \"Ask someone to take as many slips of paper as he pleases, and on each slip write a different positive number. The numbers may range from small fractions of 1 to a number the size of a \"googol\" (1 followed by a hundred zeroes) or even larger. These slips are turned face down and shuffled over the top of a table. One at a time you turn the slips face up. The aim is to stop turning when you come to the number that you guess to be the largest of the series. You cannot go back and pick a previously turned slip. If you turn over all the slips, then of course you must pick the last one turned.\"\n\nIn the article \"Who solved the Secretary problem?\" pointed out that the secretary problem remained unsolved as it was stated by M. Gardner, that is as a two-person zero-sum game with two antagonistic players. In this game Alice, the informed player, writes secretly distinct numbers on formula_1 cards. Bob, the stopping player, observes the actual values and can stop turning cards whenever he wants, winning if the last card turned has the overall maximal number. The difference with the basic secretary problem is that Bob observes the actual values written on the cards, which he can use in his decision procedures. The numbers on cards are analogous to the numerical qualities of applicants in some versions of the secretary problem. The joint probability distribution of the numbers is under the control of Alice.\n\nBob wants to guess the maximal number with the highest possible probability, while Alice's goal is to keep this probability as low as possible. It is not optimal for Alice to sample the numbers independently from some fixed distribution, and she can play better by choosing random numbers in some dependent way. For formula_30 Alice has no minimax strategy, which is closely related to a paradox of T. Cover. But for formula_31 the game has a solution: Alice can choose random numbers (which are dependent random variables) in such a way that Bob cannot play better than using the classical stopping strategy based on the relative ranks ().\n\nThe remainder of the article deals again with the secretary problem for a known number of applicants.\n\n\nEach heuristic has a single parameter \"y\". The figure (shown on right) displays the expected success probabilities for each heuristic as a function of \"y\" for problems with \"n\" = 80.\n\nFinding the single best applicant might seem like a rather strict objective. One can imagine that the interviewer would rather hire a higher-valued applicant than a lower-valued one, and not only be concerned with getting the best. That is, the interviewer will derive some value from selecting an applicant that is not necessarily the best, and the derived value increases with the value of the one selected.\n\nTo model this problem, suppose that the formula_1 applicants have \"true\" values that are random variables \"X\" drawn i.i.d. from a uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Similar to the classical problem described above, the interviewer only observes whether each applicant is the best so far (a candidate), must accept or reject each on the spot, and \"must\" accept the last one if he/she is reached. (To be clear, the interviewer does not learn the actual relative rank of \"each\" applicant. He/she learns only whether the applicant has relative rank 1.) However, in this version the \"payoff\" is given by the true value of the selected applicant. For example, if he/she selects an applicant whose true value is 0.8, then he/she will earn 0.8. The interviewer's objective is to maximize the expected value of the selected applicant.\n\nSince the applicant's values are i.i.d. draws from a uniform distribution on [0, 1], the expected value of the \"t\"th applicant given that formula_33 is given by\n\nAs in the classical problem, the optimal policy is given by a threshold, which for this problem we will denote by formula_35, at which the interviewer should begin accepting candidates. showed that \"c\" is either formula_36 or formula_37. (In fact, whichever is closest to formula_38.) This follows from the fact that given a problem with formula_1 applicants, the expected payoff for some arbitrary threshold formula_40 is\n\nDifferentiating formula_42 with respect to \"c\", one gets\n\nSince formula_44 for all permissible values of formula_35, we find that formula_46 is maximized at formula_47. Since \"V\" is convex in formula_35, the optimal integer-valued threshold must be either formula_36 or formula_37. Thus, for most values of formula_1 the interviewer will begin accepting applicants sooner in the cardinal payoff version than in the classical version where the objective is to select the single best applicant. Note that this is not an asymptotic result: It holds for all formula_1. However, this is not the optimal policy to maximize expected value from a known distribution. In the case of a known distribution, optimal play can be calculated via dynamic programming.\n\nThere are several variants of the secretary problem that also have simple and elegant solutions.\n\nOne variant replaces the desire to pick the best with the desire to pick the second-best. Robert J. Vanderbei calls this the \"postdoc\" problem arguing that the \"best\" will go to Harvard. For this problem, the probability of success for an even number of applicants is exactly formula_53. This probability tends to 1/4 as n tends to infinity illustrating the fact that it is easier to pick the best than the second-best.\n\nFor a second variant, the number of selections is specified to be greater than one. In other words, the interviewer is not hiring just one secretary but\nrather is, say, admitting a class of students from an applicant pool. Under the assumption that success is achieved if and only if all the selected candidates\nare superior to all of the not-selected candidates, it is again a problem that can be solved. It was shown in that when n is even and the desire is to select exactly half the candidates, the optimal strategy yields a success probability of formula_54.\n\nAnother variant is that of selecting the best formula_55 secretaries out of a pool of formula_1, again in an on-line algorithm. This leads to a strategy related to the classic one and cutoff threshold offormula_53 for which the classic problem is a special case .\n\nA player is allowed formula_58 choices, and he wins if any choice is the best.\n\nGilbert and Mosteller showed that formula_63.\nFor further cases that formula_64, see (for example formula_65).\n\nWhen formula_66, the probability of win converges to formula_67 ().\n\nExperimental psychologists and economists have studied the decision behavior of actual people in secretary problem situations. In large part, this work has shown that people tend to stop searching too soon. This may be explained, at least in part, by the cost of evaluating candidates. In real world settings, this might suggest that people do not search enough whenever they are faced with problems where the decision alternatives are encountered sequentially. For example, when trying to decide at which gas station along a highway to stop for gas, people might not search enough before stopping. If true, then they would tend to pay more for gas than if they had searched longer. The same may be true when people search online for airline tickets. Experimental research on problems such as the secretary problem is sometimes referred to as behavioral operations research.\n\nWhile there is a substantial body of neuroscience research on information integration, or the representation of belief, in perceptual decision-making tasks using both animal and human subjects, there is relatively little known about how the decision to stop gathering information is arrived at.\n\nResearchers have studied the neural bases of solving the secretary problem in healthy volunteers using functional MRI. A Markov decision process (MDP) was used to quantify the value of continuing to search versus committing to the current option. Decisions to take versus decline an option engaged parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well ventral striatum, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate. Therefore, brain regions previously implicated in evidence integration and reward representation encode threshold crossings that trigger decisions to commit to a choice.\n\nThe secretary problem was apparently introduced in 1949 by Merrill M. Flood, who called it the fiancée problem in a lecture he gave that year. He referred to it several times during the 1950s, for example, in a conference talk at Purdue on 9 May 1958, and it eventually became widely known in the folklore although nothing was published at the time. In 1958 he sent a letter to Leonard Gillman, with copies to a dozen friends including Samuel Karlin and J. Robbins, outlining a proof of the optimum strategy, with an appendix by R. Palermo who proved that all strategies are dominated by a strategy of the form \"reject the first \"p\" unconditionally, then accept the next candidate who is better\". (See Flood (1958).)\n\nThe first publication was apparently by Martin Gardner in Scientific American, February 1960. He had heard about it from John H. Fox, Jr., and L. Gerald Marnie, who had independently come up with an equivalent problem in 1958; they called it the \"game of googol\". Fox and Marnie did not know the optimum solution; Gardner asked for advice from Leo Moser, who (together with J. R. Pounder) provided a correct analysis for publication in the magazine. Soon afterwards, several mathematicians wrote to Gardner to tell him about the equivalent problem they had heard via the grapevine, all of which can most likely be traced to Flood's original work.\n\nThe 1/\"e\"-law of best choice is due to F. Thomas Bruss (1984).\n\nFerguson (1989) has an extensive bibliography and points out that a similar (but different) problem had been considered by Arthur Cayley in 1875 and even by Johannes Kepler long before that.\n\nThe secretary problem can be generalized to the case where there are multiple different jobs. Again, there are formula_1 applicants coming in random order. When a candidate arrives, she reveals a set of nonnegative numbers. Each value specifies her qualification for one of the jobs. The administrator not only has to decide whether or not to take the applicant but, if so, also has to assign her permanently to one of the jobs. The objective is to find an assignment where the sum of qualifications is as big as possible. This problem is identical to finding a maximum-weight matching in an edge-weighted bipartite graph where the formula_1 nodes of one side arrive online in random order. Thus, it is a special case of the online bipartite matching problem.\n\nBy a generalization of the classic algorithm for the secretary problem, it is possible to obtain an assignment where the expected sum of qualifications is only a factor of formula_77 less than an optimal (offline) assignment.\n\n\n\n"}

The site is considered among the most imposing relics of Buddhism in all of Gandhara, and has been \"exceptionally well-preserved.\"\n\nThe Buddhist monastery was founded in the 1st century CE, and was in use until the 7th century. The complex is regarded by archaeologists as being particularly representative of the architecture of Buddhist monastic centers from its era. Takht-i-Bahi was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980.\n\nThe word Takht-i-Bahi may have different explanations. Local believes that site got its name from two wells on the hill or the springs nearby. In Persian, \"Takht\" means \"top\" or \"throne\" while \"bahi\" means \"spring\" or \"water\". When combined together its meaning is \"Spring from the Top\" or \"High Spring\", and there were two springs on the top of mountains. Another meaning suggested is \"Throne of Origin\".\n\nThe ruins are located about 15 kilometers from Mardan in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. A small fortified city, dating from the same era, sits nearby. The ruins also sit near a modern village known by the same name. It is located around 500 feet atop the small hill and around 2 km from village bazar. The surrounding area is famous for sugar cane, wheat, maize, vegetable, and orchard cultivation. Once remote and little visited, the site now has a road and car park, set some way below the ruins, and has become popular with visitors.\n\nThere are four main areas of the Takht Bahi complex:\n\nAdditional structures on the site may have served as residences or meeting halls, or for secular purposes. All of the buildings on the site are constructed from local stone, and are mortared with lime and mud.\n\nArchaeologists have divided the history of the complex into four periods, beginning in the 1st century BCE.\n\nThe monastic complex was likely founded in the early 1st century CE. It is proven by an inscriptions found bearing the name of Gondophares (20-46 CE). After Gondophares, the place fell under control of Kujula Kadphises, the first Kushan king. This first era continued until the 2nd century CE, and is associated with another Kushan king Kanishka, as well as early Parthian and later Kushan kings. The second construction period, which included the creation of the Stupa Court and assembly hall, took place during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE. A third construction period, associated with the later Kushan dynasty and the Kidara Kushana rulers, occurred during the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nThe region was runover by Huns in middle of fifth century C.E. which ended the Kushan rule there. The Hun Toramana and then his son Mihirakula unleashed genocide of the populace of Gandhara and a wholesale destruction of Buddhist monastries. The Buddhist monastery of Takht-i-Bahi seems to have been destroyed in the same period of carnage by Huns. \n\nThe complex nonetheless was in use until 7th century CE.\n\nThe first modern historical reference to these ruins was made in 1836 by the French Officer, the Buddhist remains are in a village named Mazdoorabad. Explorations and excavations on this site began in 1864. A significant number of objects from the site can be found in the British Museum. The site underwent a major restoration in the 1920s.\n\nThe villages of Thordher (Old name Said Ghani Kalae), Ghafe, Lund Khwar, Sher Garh, Saroo Shah, Sehri-Bahlol, Pathai, Mazdoorabad, Fazl-e-abad, Gangai, Hathian, Jalala, Pirsaddi, Takkar and Mashal Khan Kalai are other historical places in the vicinity of Takht-Bhai. The most historical location in the era is Sehri Bahlol. This Buddhist monastery is situated on Malakand Road.\n\nThe word \"Sehri-Bahlol\" has been explained by various people in different ways. Local people claim that this is a Hindko word meaning \"Sir Bahlol\", a prominent political and religious leader of the area. However, the name is not as old as the village of Sehri-Bahlol.\n\nMeager economic conditions, poor educational facilities, and the nefarious effect of dealers of antiquities often result in severe hazard for the proper preservation of archaeological heritage in minor, less controlled sites.\n\n\n"}

The band reformed as fDeluxe in 2009.\n\nThe band's origins started with the disintegration of The Time in 1984. Lead singer Morris Day had left the band to pursue a solo career and guitarist Jesse Johnson became the de facto band leader. Prince suggested restructuring the band with new member Paul Peterson to head the group, but Johnson opposed. However, like Day, Johnson soon left the band to pursue his own solo career. A few of The Time's newer members followed Johnson to join his backing band (called Jesse Johnson's Revue).\n\nAs the band had served as an outlet for Prince to release more music, he wanted to continue this avenue, inviting the remaining members of The Time, Jellybean Johnson, Jerome Benton, and Paul Peterson, to his home and presented them with his new project. They agreed to become a new band called The Family, with Peterson renamed \"St. Paul\" as the new frontman and bassist. Johnson and Benton reprised their familiar roles from The Time. To the mix, Prince added Susannah Melvoin, the twin sister of Revolution guitarist Wendy Melvoin, as a backing singer and keyboardist. The fifth member was Eric Leeds, the brother of Prince's tour manager Alan Leeds, who provided saxophone and flute. Bassist Allen Flowers joined the band. Guitarist Miko Weaver is credited in the album's booklet because he was to be a session player and tour musician band supporter, but was never officially part of the band. \n\nMuch like The Time, the band's material was composed nearly entirely by Prince, with the exception of \"River Run Dry\", which was written by Revolution drummer Bobby Z. Prince wrote and performed all the other tracks and simply overdubbed Peterson's and Melvoin's vocals and added saxophone and flute by Leeds. On several tracks Prince's vocals can be clearly heard. Some of the original demos have surfaced as bootlegs and circulate among fans with Prince's original lead vocals, as well as two outtakes: the instrumental \"Feline\" and the pop song \"Miss Understood\". As on other associates' albums, Prince falsely gave credit to the various band members for writing credits, though he kept his name on \"Nothing Compares 2 U\". The tracks were all recorded in a few weeks' span at the end of the year 1984 after Prince had finished sessions for \"Around the World in a Day\", and just before he started to record music for Sheila E.'s album \"Romance 1600\" and his own album \"Parade\".\n\nThe album itself is a mix of uptempo funk songs (\"High Fashion\", \"Mutiny\"), unconventional soul ballads (\"Nothing Compares 2 U\", \"Desire\"), jazz-funk instrumental tracks (\"Yes\", \"Susannah's Pajamas\") and New Wave songs (\"The Screams of Passion\", \"River Run Dry\"). \"The Screams of Passion\" was released as the first single from the album. MTV placed the video for the song in light rotation. \"High Fashion\" was the second single, but no video was made.\n\nThe album sold poorly upon its release and has been out of print in any form since the late 1980s in the United States. A compact disc version was printed in Germany in the early 1990s following the success of Sinead O'Connor's cover version of Nothing Compares 2 U which was released that same year and is highly valued among Prince fans and collectors. The album is now available on iTunes.\n\nPrince often incorporated the track \"Mutiny\" into the setlist of his Parade Tour in 1986, which occasionally was extended to contain the chorus of \"Dream Factory\" and the chant \"St. Paul – punk of the month!\" as well as in later tours. From 1990 onwards Prince occasionally played \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" to the setlist of several tours.\n\nAfter the band performed a single concert, released their self-titled album and only two singles, Peterson felt constricted by Prince's control and opted to pursue his own career. Without a lead singer, Prince lost interest and absorbed most of the remaining members into the expanded Revolution with the exception of Johnson, who went on to join the Flyte Tyme music production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.\n\nAccording to St. Paul's website, he fondly remembers his time with The Family and often plays songs from the album in concert. The Family reunited on December 13, 2003, for a single performance for charity along with other acts formerly associated with Prince. On January 26, 2007, The Family announced that they are returning to the music scene, with a tour and a recording of new music. Now called fDeluxe, they finally reformed in June 2011 and released a new record called \"Gaslight\" with four of the five original members performing.\n\n\nThe video clip of \"The Screams of Passion\" shows Eric Leeds playing bass because this particular track contained no saxophone.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Even though the bands were already formed, this contest was unique as it pre-dates the format of the first music talent reality show to air in the United Kingdom, ITV1's program \"Pop stars\" in 2000.\n\nTheir debut single \"When My Baby\" charted within the Top 40. This prompted a tour supporting the Irish girl band B*Witched, and promoted their second and biggest single \"More Than I Needed to Know\". It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 5, and went on to see a global release (including Japan where it hit the top of the record chart).\n\nA promotional support tour for boy band Five provided the group with the foundation for their third single \"The Best Is Yet To Come\" which charted at number 12 in the UK. The group recorded their debut album \"Welcome to the Planet Pop\" which was released to Top 20 success in Japan. \"More Than I Needed To Know\" reached number one in Japan, and due to its popularity there, it was featured in the video game . Scooch performed at every arena in the UK and spent a year as Ambassadors for the Children's Health Authority.\n\nScooch's fourth single came in the form of the flamenco-inspired \"For Sure\" which made number 15 in the UK. It was followed by the UK version of their album entitled \"Four Sure\" which peaked just outside the UK Top 40. The band were dropped by their record label and privately split. The group briefly reformed in January 2004 to perform at G-A-Y's \"Gone But Not Forgotten\" night, the success of which prompted the band to do a tour of several gay venues and events around the UK.\n\nIn 2006, Russ Spencer took part in the E4 reality show \"Boys Will Be Girls\", in which he attempted, along with two other ex-boyband members, to pose as a girl-group. Spencer and his bandmates were given four weeks to record a single, make a pop video and play live, all the while posing as females. Spencer has also become a television presenter, presenting TV shows including \"Make Your Play\" for ITV1. His theatre work includes starring as the Child Catcher in the UK National Tour of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\".\n\nCaroline Barnes and Natalie Powers have both had various parts on the stage in the West End. Powers has also released two solo singles, \"Music to My Heart\" and \"Unchained Melody\", with Almighty Records.\n\nDavid Ducasse established his own performing arts academy in the North East in 2000 training young performers. The school is currently celebrating its 15th anniversary with a celebratory concert, which is to be performed this April. He has also worked extensively as a producer, writer and director, and continues to perform. Recent roles include Dandini alongside Emmerdale actress Roxanne Pallet in \"Cinderella\" at the Newcastle Theatre Royal for Qdos Entertainment, Francis Fryer in the UK tour of \"Calamity Jane\" for Entertainment Unlimited. This Christmas, Ducasse will play the title role in \"Dick Whittington\" at Consett Empire.\n\nBarnes and Spencer took part in Series 4 of Channel 4's \"Coach Trip\" and performed in Harry Hill's TV Burp as the finale performance in 12 March 2010 episode with the song \"Flying the Flag (For You)\" and the end of the performance, Harry (dressed as a German in Oktoberfest clothing) gives them a nul point.\n\nOn 28 February 2006, it was announced that Scooch were to reform for a Eurovision Song Contest bid.\n\nThe group appeared in the UK selection competition \"Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up\" on BBC One on Saturday 17 March 2007, singing and performing their song \"Flying the Flag (For You)\".\n\nThe show began with six songs selected by the BBC, which were reduced to two songs after the public had voted, the four songs with the fewest votes leaving the competition. The remaining two songs went head to head in a \"sing-off\" and the public voted again for the outright winner.\n\nThe show ended in controversy as the final result was announced. Fearne Cotton revealed the winner to be Scooch while, simultaneously in a much louder voice, co-host Terry Wogan announced the winner to be fellow entry Cyndi. After several seconds of confusion for the two acts, the crowd and TV viewers, it was revealed that Scooch were the actual winners of the competition and were to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. A confused Cyndi was thanked and hurried off the stage by Cotton so Scooch could perform the winning song once again before the programme ended.\n\nIt was later revealed that Scooch received 53% of the public vote, with Cyndi receiving 47%.\n\nFurther controversy ensued when the \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper reported that the band had used two backing singers offstage as part of their performance on \"Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up\", with the implication that this had given the group an advantage over rival entrants, although this was perfectly allowed. This led to false accusations of miming.\n\nRule 7 of Section 4 of 'The Extracts From the Rules for the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest' states that \"Artists shall perform live on stage, accompanied by a recorded backing-track which contains no vocals of any kind or any vocal imitations.\" So as long as the backing singers were live no rules were broken. It is common Eurovision practice to have additional singers offstage. For example, the Swedish entry in 2006 featured backing singers who did not appear onstage until the second half of the song. The rule is that a maximum number of six singers/performers can perform, but there is no rule to say that they must all be shown on stage.\n\nIn a video blog, released on Saturday 24 March 2007, singer-turned-TV presenter Charlotte Church claimed that Scooch were not worthy of winning \"Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up\". Church referred to the UK's Eurovision entry, \"Flying the Flag (for You)\" by Scooch, as \"\"absolute shit\"\" and embarrassing for Britain. Church announced that she believed Cyndi should have won the competition instead. Natalie Powers of Scooch hit back saying, \"\"As a mother of a young child myself I find her behaviour and language quite unacceptable. What kind of role model is this for a mum-to-be?\"\" Russ Spencer added, \"\"What a pity the voice of an angel has acquired the mouth of a sewer\"\".\n\nOn 28 March 2007, Swedish singer Pandora claimed that the chorus of Scooch's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, is a clear cut case of plagiarism of the chorus in her song \"No Regrets\" released in 1999. With the help of the Swedish Musicians' Union she later contacted the EBU in an attempt to have Scooch's entry disqualified from the competition.\n\nIn response to the plagiarism claim by Pandora, the BBC issued a statement confirming that Scooch's song is \"\"an original\"\" and the writers \"\"were never aware of Pandora or her songs\"\". The BBC confirmed that there had been no duplication of her work.\n\nOn 3 April 2007, the \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper apologised to the BBC and EBU for an incorrect story it published stating that the EBU had confirmed that the BBC had breached the EBU's rules during the selection of the UK's Eurovision entry. The flawed story led to rumours of miming by Scooch on the \"Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up\" show and led to accusations of competition fixing by the BBC.\n\nOn 19 March 2007, Scooch appeared on \"Richard & Judy\" on Channel 4, revealing that their dance routine for \"Flying the Flag (For You)\" in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki will be \"\"camper than ever before\"\" and \"\"may involve strings\".\" On 22 March, they appeared on \"This Morning\" on ITV1 and in the evening on \"The Graham Norton Show\" on BBC One, performing cut-down versions of the song.\n\nOn 17 April, Scooch shot the music video for their Eurovision entry \"Flying the Flag (For You)\" in London. The video was released on 23 April 2007 and could be 'exclusively' seen on the BBC Eurovision 2007 website from 24 April 2007. On 18 April, it was announced that Scooch had been signed to the Warner Bros. record label. As part of the contract, Scooch recorded several different language versions of \"Flying the Flag (For You)\", in which the phrases in the song are spoken in French, German, Spanish, Bulgarian and Danish.\n\nThroughout early May 2007, the group appeared on several British television programmes and radio programmes and took part in numerous media interviews to promote the song and themselves further. A \"child-friendly\" version of the song was performed on CBBC's Blue Peter with several spoken lines changed to reflect the target audience. Changes included \"\"Would you like a snack sir?\"\" instead of \"\"Some salted nuts Sir?\"\" and \"\"Would you like some sweets Sir?\"\" instead of \"\"Would you like something to suck on for landing sir?\"\". The quartet also performed on the \"National Lottery Draw\" on BBC One and on the ITV show \"Loose Women\".\n\nScooch rehearsed in Helsinki for the Eurovision Song Contest Final from 6 to 11 May and altered several parts of their performance numerous times in the process.\n\nOn the final night, Scooch finished joint 22nd out of 24 entries with 19 points; 7 points from Ireland and the maximum 12 points from Malta. This was the first time since 2002 that a UK Eurovision entrant had received the maximum 12 points in the competition; Malta later stated that the 12 points was a protest at how many countries in Eurovision voted for their neighbours.\n\nAlthough \"Flying the Flag (for You)\" didn't attract major European attention, the song reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart on 13 May 2007, making it the highest charting UK Eurovision entrant since Katrina and the Waves in 1997 and equalling the group's highest charting song, \"More Than I Needed To Know\".\n\nAfter Eurovision, Scooch announced that although they were staying together as a group, they had no plans to produce new material as they were too busy. However, they said they would be performing live performances and in the future, they will not rule out releasing more songs. They also stated that three of the individual members of Scooch would be performing in theatrical productions. Spencer would be playing The Child Catcher in the UK Tour of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", Barnes would continue her role in \"The Producers\", and Ducasse would be appearing as the lead-character in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" in Newcastle upon Tyne. Powers, however, planned to take time out to look after her son.\n\nNotably a songwriter of Scooch's entry Morten Schjolin participated in the national selection again in 2008 with Michelle Gayle's entry on 1 March 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Caroline and Russ, who have subsequently started a relationship, were competitors on the Fourth series of British reality show Coach Trip. They joined the show on day 18, and were evicted on day 36, making them one of the longest lasting couples of the series.\n\nSince 2007, Scooch have continued to tour the UK & Europe, from 2011 performing their new \"Scooch do Glee\" show.\n\nWhilst not performing in the band David continues his role as principal of the very successful Performers Stage School in the North East, he also is Presenter on Pride World Radio. Natalie is a principal and vocal coach at Allstars Academy performing arts school in Hemel Hempstead, Caroline works in musical theatre as a performer and choreographer and Russ is a presenter and singer currently starring in the new touring musical \"The Heat Is On!\".\n\nIn October 2011 it was announced that Scooch will be performing as a support act to The Mission who are playing a 25th Anniversary concert at London's Brixton Academy. Scooch will be in the line-up alongside goth legends Fields of the Nephilim and their inclusion has caused controversy among both sets of fans.\n\n"}

At different times, he has managed artists as diverse as the Yardbirds, John's Children, Marc Bolan, Japan, London, Ultravox, Boney M, Sinitta, Wham!, Blue Mercedes, Alsou and Candi Staton, among others.\n\nNapier-Bell attended Durston House in Ealing and then later a primary school at Perivale. He then attended Harrow County School for Boys and Bryanston School in Dorset. Whilst at Bryanston he formed the school's first jazz band. When he left school at age 17, it was with the idea of becoming a professional musician, preferably in America. A year later, unable to get a visa to the United States, he emigrated to Canada.\n\nNapier-Bell is an atheist.\n\nWhen he returned to England he worked as an assistant film editor. With a thorough knowledge of music, he soon progressed to being a music editor and landed the job of working with Burt Bacharach on \"What's New Pussycat\", re-editing the score Bacharach had written for it. Later, he also scored, wrote and edited music for \"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\" (1967), a film directed by Clive Donner.\n\nIn 1966, Dusty Springfield approached Napier-Bell and Vicki Wickham to write an English lyric to an Italian song she had heard at the Sanremo Festival, composed by Pino Donaggio. The result was \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\", which became Springfield's only number one hit in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nA friend, Vicki Wickham, who booked all the acts for the TV show \"Ready Steady Go!\", persuaded him to move into music management. He began by putting together an act himself; Nicky Scott & Diane Ferraz; a boy from London and a girl from the West Indies. The inter-racial mix was a first for the British music business. The Yardbirds asked him if he would manage them. They were looking for a replacement for their original manager, Giorgio Gomelsky. With the group's bassist, Paul Samwell-Smith, Napier-Bell then co-produced the Yardbirds’ first studio album—\"Roger the Engineer\". He oversaw the entry of Jimmy Page into the group and produced the group's next single, \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\", considered one of the most avant garde rock records of the time.\n\nNapier-Bell managed John's Children, who were better known for their ability to shock rather than for their music and who were thrown off a major tour of Germany for upstaging The Who with an act that included running round the audience throwing feathers in the air and whipping each other with chains.\n\nNapier-Bell teamed up with Ray Singer to produce records for various artists including the Scaffold (a group which included Paul McCartney's brother, Mike McGear), Peter Sarstedt, Forever More (which went on to change itself into The Average White Band) and lesser known acts, Plus and Brut. He also spent a year in Australia where he worked for Albert Productions and produced acts such as Alison McCallum, Bobbi Marchini and John Paul Young (who later credited Napier-Bell with having discovered him).\n\nFollowing this, he worked in Spain and South America for two years, managing one of Spain's biggest stars, Júnior, with whom he co-wrote several Spanish hits, in particular the biggest selling Spanish language single of the 1970s, \"Perdóname\". In 1976, he came back to London and returned to management with two new groups, London, a group in the then current punk vein, and Japan, an art-rock group. London was a short-lived project (two national tours, two singles, a 4-track EP and an album for MCA Records) but Japan involved him for the next seven years. Napier-Bell persevered with them through five lean years to eventually help make them one of the most influential groups of the early 1980s.\n\nNapier-Bell then established an association with manager Jazz Summers and together they took on the management of Wham!. The group had previously had three hit singles in the UK but wanted to terminate their contract with the record company, Innervision. Napier-Bell and Summers led them through four months of legal complications (during which they were unable to record), and finally settled the case by signing a new contract with CBS. Napier-Bell spent eighteen months travelling backwards and forwards to China negotiating for Wham! to become the first ever Western pop artist to play in communist China. They eventually played a concert there in April 1985 at the Worker's Stadium in Beijing.\n\nAt the end of 1985, Wham! ended its relationship with Napier-Bell and Summers when George Michael left Wham! for a solo career. Napier-Bell went on to manage the duo Blue Mercedes, who had one worldwide hit, \"I Want To Be Your Property\" (1987), which stayed at No. 1 in the US dance charts for 14 weeks. He arranged for the defunct pop group Boney M. to reform and had all their old tracks remixed by Stock Aitken Waterman. The result was an album that stayed at number one in the French charts for four months but sold little elsewhere.\n\nFollowing this, Napier-Bell collaborated with another manager, Harry Cowell, and they took on the management of two once major groups looking to revive their careers – Asia and Ultravox. Asia fared better than Ultravox, but eventually Napier-Bell gave up on both of them and spent three years writing a book, \"Black Vinyl White Powder\". He returned to artist management, this time working in Russia, first managing Alsou, a girl singer, then Smash!!, a boy duo with Wham! similarities In 2013, he joined forces with Dutch entrepreneur Björn de Water by setting up Snap-B Music Ltd, a music consultancy company offering advice to artist managers. Napier-Bell terminated his directorship of the company in 2016 but remains a consultant.\n\nWhen Japan broke up, Napier-Bell wrote his first book, \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\", about his experiences in the music business in the 1960s. When he ceased managing Asia and Ultravox he wrote another book, \"Black Vinyl White Powder\", about the British music business which was received with favourable reviews. In March 2005, he published another book, \"I'm Coming To Take You To Lunch\", the story of how he took Wham! to China.\n\nIn 2015, Unbound Books published his fourth book, \"Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay\", which is a complete history of the music industry since the early 18th Century until today. All four books have received multiple reviews. \n\nIn recent years he has turned to film-making and directed three full-length documentary films: To Be Frank , about Frank Sinatra, and 27: Gone Too Soon , about the 27 Club, both for Netflix; 50 Years Legal, marking 50 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK, for Sky Arts. \n\nNapier-Bell is CEO of the Pierbel Group , which offers music management and consultancy, and is originating producer of Raiding the Rock Vault , the No 1 rated music show in Las Vegas , and Raiding the Country Vault, in Branson, Missouri.\n\n"}

He now plays professional basketball for the Power in the BIG3. He also works as an analyst for Fox Sports.\n\nMaggette excelled at Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois where he was an All-American in basketball.\n\nMaggette, a , small forward, played college basketball for Duke University where as a freshman in 1998–99, he averaged 10.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and was named to the ACC All-Rookie Team. Along with Duke teammates Elton Brand and William Avery, he is notable for being one of the first Duke players to leave before the end of his athletic eligibility during the tenure of coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nIn July 2000, Maggette signed a sworn statement that as a high schooler, he accepted $2,000 from his Amateur Athletic Union summer league coach Myron Piggie, a move that put his eligibility at Duke in question. In 2004, the NCAA decided not to punish Duke because they were found to have been unaware about Maggette's eligibility issue while at Duke.\n\nMaggette was selected with the 13th overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics but was later traded to the Orlando Magic on draft night along with Dale Ellis, Don MacLean, and Billy Owens for Horace Grant and 2nd round draft picks from the 2000 and 2001 drafts. As a rookie in 1999–2000, he averaged 8.4 points and 3.9 rebounds over 77 games and scored a season-high 20 points on January 3 against the Detroit Pistons.\n\nOn June 28, 2000, Maggette was traded, along with Keyon Dooling, Derek Strong, and cash considerations, to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for a 2006 first-round pick. During his career with the Clippers, Maggette, whose teammates nicknamed him \"Maximus,\" established himself as a solid forward and developed into a perennial 15+ per game scorer. He became known for excellent jumping ability as well as his propensity to create contact and get to the free throw line – he was consistently among the league leaders in free throws attempted and made. Maggette participated in the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2001 NBA All-Star Weekend and experienced a good year in 2004–05, touting career-highs in points, rebounds, assists and free throw percentage. Bothered by a nagging foot injury, he sat out much of the 2005–06 season. On April 22, 2006, Maggette and his teammates helped the Clippers win their first NBA playoff game in 13 years by defeating the Denver Nuggets in Game 1 of their first-round match-up. Two days later, the team won their second playoff game, going 2–0 against an opponent for the first time in franchise history. On May 1, 2006, they defeated the Nuggets in Game 5 and, as a result, their first playoff series since they moved from Buffalo. In the Western Conference semifinals, the Clippers faced the Phoenix Suns and lost in seven games. In a series-saving 118–106 Game 6 win over the Suns, Maggette came off the bench to score 25 points while shooting 7-of-8 shooting from the field and 9-of-9 from the free throw line – the best playoff performance of his career.\n\nMaggette returned strongly during the 2006–07 season despite an alleged feud with coach Mike Dunleavy. Maggette had a career-high night against the Los Angeles Lakers on April 12, 2007, scoring 39 points to secure a 118–110 victory after recovering from a 17-point deficit.\n\nOn June 30, 2008, Maggette opted out of the final year of his contract with the Clippers and officially became an unrestricted free agent.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, Maggette signed a five-year, $50 million contract with the Golden State Warriors. Upon signing with the Warriors, general manager Chris Mullin said of Maggette, \"He gets his points and rebounds. But I just think it's his approach to the work and his lifestyle that will be a huge benefit for our young guys. They can watch him, see how he approaches it and maybe they can emulate him.\"\n\nPlaying a sixth man role for the Warriors, Maggette averaged 19.3 points and 5.4 rebounds in 121 games over two seasons for the franchise.\n\nOn June 22, 2010, Maggette was traded, along with a 2010 second-round pick, to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Charlie Bell and Dan Gadzuric. On January 28, 2011, he recorded season-highs with 29 points and 11 rebounds in a 116-110 win over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nOn June 23, 2011, Maggette was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats as part of a three-team deal that also involved the Sacramento Kings. He managed just 32 games for the Bobcats in the lockout-shortened season, scoring a season-high 29 points on March 6, 2012 against the Orlando Magic.\n\nOn June 26, 2012, Maggette was traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Ben Gordon and a future first-round draft pick. After missing the first eight games of the 2012–13 season while nursing a calf injury suffered in preseason, Maggette made his Pistons debut on November 14, recording 9 points and 3 assists off the bench in a 94-76 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. He managed to play the next 17 games before being sitting out the rest of the season from mid-December onwards due to personal reasons mixed with not being played by coach Lawrence Frank and citing his lack of interest in the game.\n\nFollowing the 2012–13 season, he became a free agent and subsequently signed a training camp deal with the San Antonio Spurs on September 30, 2013. However, he was later waived by the Spurs on October 15 after appearing in two preseason games. He later retired from basketball after 14 years in the NBA.\n\nIn October 2014, Maggette joined Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket as an analyst for the Los Angeles Clippers. He later joined Fox Sports 1 as a college basketball analyst.\n\nIn 2017, Maggette joined the BIG3 team Power for their inaugural season which ended with him suffering a torn achilles in his team's opening game. In August 2018, Maggette was named 2018 BIG3 MVP and Captain of the Year after leading the Power to a 7-1 regular season record. Led by Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman as coach and league MVP Maggette's 27 points, team Power won the championship game 51-43. In May 2019, Maggette returned to the BIG3 to defend his team's championship, his MVP status and his team's health.\n\nOff the court, Maggette worked with children as a member of the Clippers Reading All-Star Team. His \"Uh Oh Maggette-O Kids\" program brought hundreds of children to Clippers games for free. In 1999, he established his own \"Corey Maggette Flight 50 Basketball Camp\" and initially invited 50 kids to the first year's camp. After almost a decade, the camp was taking over 600 kids to its camps each year and won an \"NBA Player's Best Camp Award\" for its efforts. In June 2006, he also established \"Corey Cares Foundation\" to serve, mentor and inspire the less fortunate in the community of basketball and sports.\n\nIn 2007, Maggette made a brief guest appearance in the music video for Common's Drivin' Me Wild.\n\n"}
{"id": "1971788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971788", "title": "Long Man of Wilmington", "text": "Long Man of Wilmington\n\nThe Long Man of Wilmington or Wilmington Giant is a hill figure on the steep slopes of Windover Hill near Wilmington, East Sussex, England. It is northwest of Eastbourne and south of Wilmington. Locally, the figure was once often called the \"Green Man\". The Long Man is tall, holds two \"staves\", and is designed to look in proportion when viewed from below.\n\nFormerly thought to originate in the Iron Age or even the neolithic period, a 2003 archaeological investigation has shown that the figure may have been cut in the Early Modern era – the 16th or 17th century AD. From afar the figure appears to have been carved from the underlying chalk; but the modern figure is formed from white-painted breeze blocks and lime mortar.\n\nThe Long Man is one of two major extant human hill figures in England; the other is the Cerne Abbas Giant, north of Dorchester. Both are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. Two other hill figures that include humans are the Osmington White Horse and the Fovant regimental badges. The Long Man is one of two hill figures in East Sussex; the other is the Litlington White Horse.\n\nThe origin of the Long Man remains unclear. For many years the earliest known record was a drawing made by William Burrell when he visited Wilmington Priory, near Windover (or Wind-door) Hill, in 1766. Burrell's drawing shows a figure holding a rake and a scythe, both shorter than the present staves. In 1993, another drawing was discovered in the Devonshire Collections at Chatsworth House which had been made by the surveyor John Rowley in 1710, now the first definite date on which the figure is known to have existed.\n\nAn early suggestion, sometimes stated to be a local tradition, was that the Long Man had been cut by monks from nearby Wilmington Priory, and represented a pilgrim, but this was not widely believed by antiquarians, who felt that monks were unlikely to have created an unclothed figure. Until fairly recently the Long Man was most commonly asserted to have been cut in the neolithic period, primarily due to the presence of a long barrow nearby, or given an Iron Age attribution based on a perceived similarity to other hill figures.\n\nProfessor John North wrote that during the centuries around 3480 BC the figure would have been positioned to mark the constellation Orion's movement across the ridge above it. The figure, according to this interpretation, may have been a manifestation of a Neolithic astral religion. Another suggestion was that the figure had a Romano-British provenance, while an origin in the time of Anglo-Saxon England gained credence after the 1965 discovery at Finglesham in Kent of an Anglo-Saxon brooch depicting a figure, (possibly Odin), holding two spears in a similar fashion to the Long Man.\n\nArchaeological work performed in 2003 by Professor Martin Bell of the University of Reading, in association with Aubrey Manning's Open University programme \"Landscape Mysteries\", strongly suggested that the figure dates from the Early Modern period – the 16th or 17th century AD. Bell found that the slope on which the Long Man was cut had gone through a period of instability in this time, after a very long prior period of stability, suggesting that the figure was first cut then. This has opened up the possibility that the Long Man could be a Tudor or Stuart-era political satire in the manner recently posited for the Cerne Abbas giant, or possibly a religious image associated with the Reformation: Professor Ronald Hutton noted that \"we can at least celebrate the fact that we have our first, apparently unequivocally, Early Modern hill figure, and historians now have to reckon with it.\"\n\nWhatever the figure's origin, for much of its history it seems to have existed only as a shadow or indentation in the grass, visible after a light fall of snow or as a different shade of green in summer: it is described or illustrated as such in 1710, 1781, 1800, 1835 and 1851. Indeed, the figure was once known locally as the \"Green Man\". Earlier depictions, such as those of Rowley and Burrell, show other details such as a possible scythe blade on the right-hand staff and the suggestion of a helmet or hat on the figure's head: they also indicate a different, albeit indistinct, position for the feet. The current outline of the Long Man is largely the result of a 'restoration' of 1873-4, when a group led by the vicar of Glynde, Reverend William de St Croix, marked out the outline with yellow bricks whitewashed and cemented together, though it has been claimed that the restoration process distorted the position of the feet.\n\nThe archaeologist John S. Phené, who was co-opted into the project and whose 1873 talk to the Royal Institute of British Architects had originally inspired it, initially expressed his reservations with both the bricking and the design used. The original intention of the 'restoration' had been to cut the figure down to the chalk bedrock, but had been abandoned after trials showed that the soil depth made this too difficult.\n\nIn the years after the 'restoration' several people familiar with the figure commented that the feet were altered, having originally both pointed outwards and downwards so that \"the Giant appeared to be coming down the hill\", in the words of Ann Downs, who had grown up at Wilmington Priory in the 1840s. Resistivity surveys conducted in the 1990s by R. Castleden, combined with examination of apparent shadow marks shown in early photographs, have provided strong evidence that the feet had in fact pointed outwards as described by 19th century observers and had been slightly lower than in the current outline. The surveys showed that the figure had likely been originally cut by trenching, in the same manner as other chalk hill figures, but had been abandoned after only a few scourings.\n\nThere was also some evidence to suggest that the feature on one staff similar to a scythe blade, flail or shepherd's crook was genuine, along with a suggestion of a \"helmet\" or hat. It seems likely that the proportions of the figure have been distorted slightly by the 1873 bricking and the 1969 replacement of the bricks with breeze blocks, with the Long Man having been up to tall prior to 1873.\n\nIn 1925, the site of the Long Man was given to the Sussex Archaeological Trust (now the Sussex Archaeological Society) by the Duke of Devonshire. During the Second World War it was painted green to avoid it being used as a landmark by German aircraft.\n\nThe 1993 book, \"The Druid Way\" by Sussex author Philip Carr-Gomm, drew attention to the supposed significance of the Long Man as a sacred site for the modern world.\n\nAt dawn on May Day, the Long Man Morris Men dance at the foot of the Long Man. The Long Man plays host to neo-pagan rituals on Sundays closest to the eight Pagan Festivals through the year.\n\nIn 2007, the Long Man of Wilmington was used in Trinny Woodall's and Susannah Constantine's television fashion show \"Undress the Nation\". Trinny, Susannah and 100 women gave the Long Man a temporary female form by using their bodies to add pigtails, breasts and hips. ITV stated that they were given permission for the event by Sussex Archaeological Society and that they took \"the utmost care... to protect this historical site\". The Long Man was not permanently changed or affected, according to the owners, the Sussex Archaeological Society. The stunt prompted local Druid Greg Draven to form a protest during filming. Sussex Archaeological Society later apologised for any offence caused to any \"individuals or groups\" by the filming. The Council of British Druid Orders claimed the stunt would \"dishonour an ancient Pagan site of worship\".\n\nOvernight, between 17 June and 18 June 2010 a giant phallus was painted on the Long Man rivalling that of the Cerne Abbas Giant. Observed by locals it appeared that a football pitch marker or similar object was used to paint the phallus onto the Long Man.\n\nIn Arthur Beckett's 1909 'Spirit of the Downs', a whole chapter is dedicated to the Long Man of Wilmington, in \"The Hero on the Hill', and gives a fictional account of the invading Saxon's victory over the Britons, who celebrate by drawing an enormous figure on the Downs.\n\nEleanor Farjeon, in her book \"Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field\" (1937), gives a fancy origin of the giant in a form of a folktale told by Martin Pippin the bard to six young girls in the daisy field.\n\nIn his comic (1990), Neil Gaiman interprets the figure as the guardian of a gateway into Faerie.\n\nElectronic pop group Kissing the Pink shot the promotional video for their 1982 single \"Mr Blunt\" at the Long Man.\n\nThe Long Man plays a prominent role in the Spike and Suzy comic book \"The Circle of Power\" (1998).\n\nThe figure also features in 'The Old Weird Albion' by Justin Hopper and 'The Light Keeper' by Cole Moreton\n\nThe Long Man has long been an influence on artists, musicians, and authors. The composers Benjamin Britten and Frank Bridge would often picnic at the foot of the figure and most recently it has inspired '\"The Long Man's Legs\"' (SAB Choir, soprano soloist and narrater) by Tony Biggin and \"'On Windover Hill\"' by Nathan James, which will be premiered in Chichester by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Harlequin Chamber Choir on 07/03/20. The figure was also an influence on Avril Coleridge-Taylor's work for chorus and orchestra, \"Wyndore\", which was written in Alfriston in 1936. The folk-singer, Maria Cunningham, wrote one of the only folk songs about the Long Man, in 1996.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971791", "title": "Basilica della Santa Casa", "text": "Basilica della Santa Casa\n\nThe Basilica della Santa Casa () is a shrine of Marian pilgrimage in Loreto, Italy. The basilica is known for enshrining the house in which the Blessed Virgin Mary is believed by some Catholics to have lived. A legend claims the same house was flown over by angelic beings from Nazareth to Tersatto (Trsat in Croatia), then to Recanati, before arriving at the current site.\n\nPope Benedict XV designated the Blessed Virgin Mary under the same title to be Patroness of air passengers and auspicious travel on 24 March 1920. Accordingly, Pope Pius XI granted a Canonical Coronation to the image of Our Lady of Loreto made of Cedar of Lebanon on 5 September 1922, replacing the torched image consumed in fire on 23 February 1921.\n\nThe basilica is a Late Gothic structure continued by Giuliano da Maiano (1432–1490), Giuliano da Sangallo (1445–1516) and Donato Bramante (1444–1514). It is 93 meters long, 60 meters wide, and its campanile is 75.6 meters high.\n\nThe façade of the church was erected under Sixtus V, who in 1586 fortified Loreto and gave it the privileges of a town; his colossal statue stands on the parvis, above the front steps, a third of the way to the left as one enters. Over the principal doorway there is a lifesize bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by Girolamo Lombardo; the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the 16th century under the reign of Paul V (1605–1621) are also by Lombardo (1506-1590), his sons and his pupils, among them Tiburzio Vergelli (1551-1609), who also made the fine bronze font in the interior. The doors and hanging lamps are by the same artists.\n\nThe richly decorated campanile (1750 to 1754), by Luigi Vanvitelli, is of great height; the principal bell, presented by Leo X in 1516, weighs 11 tons.\n\nThe interior of the church has mosaics by Domenichino and Guido Reni and other works of art, including statues by Raffaello da Montelupo. In the sacristies on each side of the right transept are frescoes, on the right by Melozzo da Forlì, on the left by Luca Signorelli and in both there are some fine intarsias; the basilica as a whole is thus a collaborative work by generations of architects and artists.\n\nThe main attraction of Loreto is the Holy House itself (in Italian, the \"Santa Casa di Loreto\"). It has been a Catholic pilgrimage destination since at least the 14th century and a popular tourist destination for non-Catholics as well.\n\nThe \"house\" itself consists of three stone walls. It is a plain stone structure, with a door on the north side and a window on the west. The size is 31 13 feet, i.e. 9 x 4 m (or 8.5 m by 3.8 m and 4.1 m high). \n\nThe \"house\" contains the \"Altar of the Apostles\", venerated as the authentic one built by St Peter and the Apostles.\n\nA niche contains a 33 inches high black image of the Virgin and Child, a statue made of Lebanon cedar, richly adorned with jewels, placed above the altar. A legend attributes the statue to Saint Luke, described in the Bible a physician, with a later tradition adding painting to his skills, and here given also the attribute of a sculptor; but its style suggests it was created in the 15th century.\n\nThe \"Black Madonna\", known as Our Lady of Loreto, owes its dark colour to centuries of lamp smoke and is carved from Cedar of Lebanon. Much like the Holy House, it is associated with miracles. The statue was commissioned after a fire in the Santa Casa in 1921 destroyed the original madonna, and it was granted a Canonical Coronation in 1922 by Pope Pius XI. In October 2019 Pope Francis restored the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, commemorated on December 10, to the universal Roman calendar.\n\nAround the house is a tall marble screen designed by Bramante and executed under Popes Leo X, Clement VII and Paul III, by Andrea Sansovino, Girolamo Lombardo, Bandinelli, Guglielmo della Porta and others in the baroque style. The four sides represent the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto and the Nativity of the Virgin, respectively.\n\nThe Hall of the Treasury dates from the beginning of the 17th century. It contains votive offerings, liturgical objects and vestments. The frescoes on the vaulted ceiling are exquisite examples of late Roman Mannerism and were created in 1605-1610 by Cristoforo Roncalli, known as Pomarancio. The architectural design is finer than the details of the sculpture. The apse is decorated with 19th-century German frescoes.\n\nLate medieval religious traditions developed suggesting that this was the house in which the Holy Family (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) had lived while in Judea at the start of the first century AD, and which was miraculously flown over to Europe by four angels just before the final expulsion of the Christian Crusaders from the Holy Land, in order to protect it from Muslim soldiers. According to this narrative, this is the Nazareth house in which Mary had been born and brought up, received the Annunciation, conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit, and had lived during the childhood of Christ.\n\nThe tradition holds that after Jesus's Ascension, the house was converted into a church where the Apostles placed an altar, at which Saint Peter, considered by Catholics to be the first Pope, celebrated the first Eucharist after the Resurrection, the \"Altar of the Apostles\" inside the \"house\" being venerated as the authentic one. \n\nIn 336, Empress Helena made a pilgrimage to Nazareth and allegedly directed that a basilica be erected over it, in which worship continued until the fall of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such an intervention.\n\nThe narrative further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously carried by angels through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at Tersatto (now Trsat, a suburb of Rijeka, Croatia), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous miraculous cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of Dalmatia. In 1294, angels again carried it across the Adriatic Sea to the woods near Recanati (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin \"lauretum\", Italian \"Colle dei Lauri\" or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. \"sacellum gloriosæ Virginis in Laureto\"). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title \"Our Lady of Loreto\", sometimels applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host.\n\nA more detailed narrative mentions five transitions: in May 1291 from Nazareth to Tersatto, where it remained for over three years; from there to the other side of the Adriatic Sea, to Posatora (now part of Ancona) in the Marche region; after nine months to woods near Recanati in Marche; after eight months to a hill a mile away, Monte Prodo, near Loreto, where local counts petition the pope for ownership of the pilgrimage site; and finally, at the end of 1296, to the current position on the road then connecting Recanati to Porto Recanati, on public ground free of property claims.\n\nBulls in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, either the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by Julius II in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (\"ut pie creditur et fama est\"). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, Innocent XII appointed a \"missa cum officio proprio\" (a special mass) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the Spanish Breviary as a greater double on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, Benedict XVI visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of John XXIII's visit. In his visit, Benedict formally entrusted the World Synod of Bishops and the Year of Faith to the Virgin of Loreto.\n\nAn authority on Loreto has summed up the controversy concerning the miraculous flight of the Holy House by writing that it has attracted \"the ridicule of one half of the world and the devotion of the other.\"\n\nAnalysis by Italian archaeologists and architects reached the conclusion that the Holy House\n\nIn modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to an aristocratic family called \"Angelos\", which were responsible for the transfer. There are 16th century bas-reliefs, which suggest that the Holy House was transported by sea. In May 1900, papal physician Giuseppe Lapponi indicated that he had read in the Vatican archives documents suggesting that the members of the noble Byzantine family named Angelos had saved the stones of the House from Muslim devastation and transported them to Loreto. In a second step, in late 1294, Nikephoros, ruler of Epirus from the Angelos family (in Italian: Niceforo Angeli), sent on the bricks to Italy as a wedding gift for his daughter who had married Prince Philip, the son of the King of Naples, in October that year. In both Greek and Latin, the family name Angelos/Angeli means \"angels\". The stones considered by researchers to be authentic are still visibly marked with Roman numerals, by scratching or with coal, which suggest that the three walls were carefully taken apart with the intention to faithfully reassemble them at another location, which actually happened. The traditional date of the miraculous translation, 12th May 1291, is compatible with the historical dates - the port city of Acre, the Crusader capital, fell six days later, theoretically allowing for the shipment of the stones, once they had been carried by cart from Nazareth to the port of Acre. \n\nArchaeological excavations were carried out in 1962-65. Among the numerous coins found underneath the building, there were two bearing the inscription \"Gui Dux Atenes\". Meant is Guy II de la Roche, the Regent of Athens from 1280 to 1287. His parents were the Frankish nobleman, William I, Duke of Athens, and Aromanian Greek princess Helena Angelina Komnene, the daughter of John Doukas, Prince of Thessaly, also known as John Angelos. Through his mother, Guy was related to the Byzantine families of the Komnenos and Doukas, Emperors of Constantinople and Epirus. Helena was Regent of the Duchy of Athens from the death of her husband in 1287 until her son's reaching the age of majority in 1294, covering the entire time span of the translation of the Holy House from Nazareth, to Epirus, to Recanati (Loreto). The presence of the two coins are proof that the Angelos family, known in Italian as Angeli and later as De Angeli, supervised the event. The law of Recanati categorically prohibited construction of any type of building on public roads, providing for its immediate demolition; only an intervention from a very high authority could have lead to a suspension of the law, as it obviously happened in the case of the House. Archaeological examination offered further proof for both the provenance of the stones from Nazareth, and for them being reassembled at Loreto, where several phases of support construction for the three-wall structure could be detected.\n\nThe documented history of the house can only be traced as far back as the close of the Crusades, around the 14th century. An early brief reference is made in the \"Italia Illustrata\" of Flavius Blondus (1392–1463), secretary to Popes Eugene IV, Nicholas V, Calixtus III and Pius II; it can be read in its entirety in the \"Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesiæ Lauretana historia\", by a certain Teremannus, contained in the \"Opera Omnia\" (1576) of Baptista Mantuanus.\n\nAccording to Herbert Thurston, in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \"\"ut pie creditur et fama est\"\", \"as is piously believed and reported to be\".\n\nThurston suggests that a miracle-working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersatto in Illyria (more precisely: Dalmatia) to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building.\n\nFinally, Thurston draws comparisons to the shrine at Walsingham, the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \"Our Lady's house\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. Edward the Confessor a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.\n\nThe basilica holding the \"Santa Casa\" was built starting from 1468.\n\nIn 1797, Napoleon's troops sacked the church. The treasury was emptied, either looted by soldiers, or its contents requisitioned by the pope who needed money for the payments required by the Treaty of Tolentino, which he had signed with Napoleon. Still, by 1821 the Black Madonna had been returned from the Louvre via Rome, and the treasury was again filled with valuable offerings.\n\nOur Lady of Loreto is the title of the Virgin Mary with respect to the Holy House of Loreto. This name is also used her statue displayed inside the Holy House. In the 1600s a Mass and a Marian litany was approved. This \"Litany of Loreto\" is the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, one of the five litanies approved for public recitation by the Church. In 1920 Pope Benedict XV declared the Madonna of Loreto patron saint of air travellers and pilots. The statue was granted a Canonical Coronation in 1922 by Pope Pius XI. In October 2019 Pope Francis restored the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, commemorated on December 10, to the universal Roman calendar.\n\nDue to Our Lady of Loreto being the patroness of aviators, Charles Lindbergh took a Loreto statuette with him on his flight across the Atlantic, and Apollo 9 carried a Loreto medallion on its flight to the moon.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971795", "title": "Napata", "text": "Napata\n\nNapata (Old Egyptian \"Npt\", \"Npy\"; Meroitic \"Napa\"; and Ναπάται) was a city of ancient Nubia on the west bank of the Nile at the site of modern Karima, Sudan. It was the southernmost permanent settlement in the New Kingdom of Egypt (16th–11th centuries BC) and the main Nubian cult centre of Amun. It was the sometime capital of the Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty and, after its fall in 663 BC, of the Kingdom of Kush. In 593 BC, it was sacked by the Egyptians and the Kushite capital was relocated to Meroë. The city was sacked a second time by the Romans in 23 BC but was rebuilt and continued as an important centre of the Amun cult.\n\nThe terms \"Napata\" or \"Napatan period\" can also refer to the Kushite polity from its rise around 750 BC until 270 BC, when Napata finally lost its symbolic significance as the location of royal burials to Meroë. The subsequent period of Kushite history is called Meroitic down to the collapse of the kingdom.\n\nNapata was founded by Thutmose III in the 15th century BC after his conquest of Nubia. The nearby Jebel Barkal was taken to mark the southern border of the New Kingdom of Egypt.\n\nIn 1075 BC, the High Priest of Amun at Thebes, capital of Egypt, became powerful enough to limit the power of Pharaoh Smendes of the post-Ramesside Twenty-first Dynasty over Upper Egypt. This was the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period (1075–664 BC). The fragmentation of power in Egypt allowed the Nubians to regain autonomy. They founded the Kingdom of Kush, which was centered at Napata. A stela erected in Napata in the eighth century presents a Kushite king (whose title has been hammered out) as the only ruler legitimated by the god Amun, appointing the kinglets and Libyan chiefs who shared Egypt at that time and derived their legitimacy from the generals' discretion.\n\nIn 750 BC, Napata was a developed city, while Egypt was still suffering political instability. Kashta, whose name is Egyptian for \"the Kushite\", profited from it, and attacked Upper Egypt. His policy was pursued by his successors Piye, and Shabaka (721–707 BC), who eventually brought the whole Nile Valley under Kushitic control in the second year of his reign. Overall, the Kushite kings ruled Upper Egypt for approximately one century and the whole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BC. They constitute the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho’s \"Aegyptiaca\".\n\nThe reunited Egyptian empire under the 25th dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom and ushered in a renaissance. Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, Jebel Barkal, and elsewhere.\n\nPharaoh Taharqa's reign and that of his eventual successor, his cousin Tantamani, were filled with constant conflict with the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Around 670 BC, emperor Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) conquered Lower Egypt, but allowed local kingdoms there to exist in order to enlist them as his allies against the Kushite rulers of Upper Egypt, who had been accepted with reluctance.\n\nWhen King Ashurbanipal succeeded Esarhaddon, the Kushite king Taharqa convinced some rulers of Lower Egypt to break with Assyrians. However, Assurbanipal overpowered the coalition and deported the Egyptian leaders to his capital, Nineveh. He appointed the Libyan chief Necho, ruler of Memphis and Saïs. Necho I was the first king of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664–525 BC) of Egypt, which is also known as the \"Saïte Dynasty\".\n\nIn 664 BC, the Assyrians laid the final blow, sacking Thebes and Memphis. The same year, Taharqa died. The new Kushite king, Tantamani (664–653 BC), killed Necho I that same year when he tried to invade Lower Egypt. However, Tantamani was unable to defeat the Assyrians, who backed Necho’s son, Psamtik I. Tantamani eventually abandoned his attempt to conquer Lower Egypt and retreated to Napata. However, his authority over Upper Egypt was acknowledged until the 8th regnal year of his reign at Thebes (or 656 BC), when Psamtik I dispatched a naval fleet to Upper Egypt and succeeded in placing all of Egypt under his control.\n\nThe 25th dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to Napata. It was there (at El-Kurru and Nuri) that all 25th dynasty pharaohs are buried under the first pyramids that the Nile valley had seen since the Middle Kingdom.\n\nThe Napatan dynasty continued to rule the Kushite state, which flourished in Napata and Meroë until at least the second century AD.\n\nNapata remained the centre of the Kingdom of Kush for another two generations, from the 650s to 590 BC. Its economy was essentially based on gold, with 26th dynasty Egypt an important economic ally.\n\nNapatan architecture, paintings, writing script, and other artistic and cultural forms were in Kush style. Egyptian burial customs were practised, including the resurrection of pyramid building. Also, several ancient Egyptian deities were worshipped. The most important god was Amun, a Theban deity. The Temple of Amun and the Temple of Mut were the most important ones at Napata, located at the foot of Jebel Barkal.\n\nAfter the Achaemenid conquest of Egypt, Napata lost its economic influence. The Napatan region itself was desiccating, leading to less cattle and agriculture. An Achaemenid raid had seriously affected Napata in 591 BC. Finally, Napata was losing its role of economic capital to Meroë. The island of Meroë, the peninsula formed by the Nile and the Atbarah River, was an area rich in iron, which was becoming an essential source of wealth. Meroe eventually became the capital of the Kingdom of Kush, leading to the abandonment of Napata.\n\nIn 23 BC, the Governor of Roman Egypt Gaius Petronius invaded Kush with 10,000 men after an initial attack by the queen of Meroë, razing Napata to the ground. In the \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\" (\"Deeds of the Divine Augustus\"), Augustus claims that \"a penetration was made as far as the town of Napata, which is next to Meroe.\n\nAfter the Roman sack, Napata was restored by King Natakamani, who renovated the temple of Amun and constructed a palace. Later, the site was abandoned, its buildings plundered and destroyed. There is circumstantial evidence that this may have been the result of religious changes.\n\nNapata was mentioned in Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Aida\" (1871) in Act III, when Amonasro uses Aida to learn where Rhadames will lead his army.\n\n"}

Channon later became a successful racehorse trainer.\n\nChannon was born in Orcheston, Wiltshire and made his debut for Southampton as a 17-year-old in 1966, scoring in a match against Bristol City. Within three years he had established himself as the club's main goalscorer and was consistent in front of goal at a time when Southampton were one of the less fashionable teams in English football's First Division. However, despite a record season tally of 21 goals for Southampton in 1974, the club was relegated to the Second Division at the end of the season.\n\nChannon stayed loyal to Southampton despite obvious concerns for his international chances and was rewarded in 1976 which was a special year for Channon.

It was his first domestic honour in the game.\n\nIn the 1977 close season, Channon left Southampton — still in the Second Division — to join Manchester City in a £300,000 deal. His new club were making progress, having just finished second in the First Division behind champions Liverpool, but this was where they peaked and Channon struggled to settle. He scored just 12 goals in his first season and 11 in his second.\n\nChannon went back to Southampton (by now back in the First Division) in September 1979. Now in his thirties, he continued to play regularly though his goals ratio was not good in his second spell, with only ten coming in each of his first two seasons back at the club. He joined Newcastle United in 1982 after playing 510 games for Southampton over two spells, scoring a total of 185 goals placing him top of the club's list of all-time goalscorers.\n\nHe lasted barely a month at Newcastle before joining Bristol Rovers. His impressive career seemingly on the decline, he failed to score in nine games for Bristol Rovers before a sudden departure again, this time to Norwich City where, at the age of 34, he found some of his old touch. He played 88 games over three seasons, scoring 16 goals, and suffered a mixed end to his Norwich career in 1985 when the club won the League Cup — Channon's second and final domestic honour — with a 1–0 win over Sunderland at Wembley, but were then relegated (with Sunderland) at the end of the same season. Channon joined Portsmouth and Finn Harps (where he played in one League of Ireland Cup game), before retiring from the game in 1986.\n\nCalled up to make his debut for England by Alf Ramsey in October 1972, Channon played well enough in a 1–1 draw with Yugoslavia at Wembley to be selected for the squads for two subsequent qualifying matches for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, although he wasn't eventually in the team for either. However, he won his second cap in a famous 5–0 hammering of Scotland at Hampden Park in February 1973, scoring his first goal in the process.\n\nAs the year progressed, Channon scored again in a match against Wales and then added a brace in a 7–0 thumping of Austria before he was picked by Ramsey for his first competitive match - a crucial and ultimately infamous World Cup qualifier against Poland at Wembley. If England didn't win, they wouldn't qualify for the tournament. Channon, in his tenth England outing, was in an attacking line-up which spent pretty much the whole match in the Poland half, trying to break the deadlock. Channon saw his own chances saved by the eccentric but inspired goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski and the game ended 1–1.\n\nHe played in a series of post-season friendlies for England, scoring in three of them and was kept in the side the following October as England began their campaign to qualify for the 1976 European Championships. Channon scored in the game against Czechoslovakia as England won 3–0. Channon's next goal for England was a while coming — in September 1975 — as England beat Switzerland in a friendly. England had two qualifying games left at the end of the year for the 1976 European Championships and Channon scored in both, but England lost 2–1 to the Czechs in Bratislava and then only drew 1–1 with Portugal in Lisbon. England failed to qualify and the Czechs went on to win the tournament.\n\nAfter winning an FA Cup medal in the 1976 Final, Channon was back at Wembley days later to score twice in England's 4–0 win over Northern Ireland; he then scored again four days later against Scotland but England lost 2–1 at Hampden Park. There followed a summer tournament in the U.S. for the bi-centennial celebrations, and Channon scored twice in a thrilling game against Italy as England came from two goals down to win 3–2. A fortnight later, Channon scored again as England defeated Finland 4–1 in Helsinki to get their qualification campaign for the 1978 FIFA World Cup off to a perfect start, though this would be tempered a month later by a defeat against Italy in Rome.\n\nIn March 1977, Channon scored twice as England beat Luxembourg at Wembley to get their World Cup campaign back on track; Luxembourg were the 'whipping boys' of the group and England would later need to demolish Luxembourg by a similar or better scoreline in Luxembourg to give themselves a chance of overhauling Italy and qualifying for the World Cup.\n\nChannon hit his 20th England goal in a 2–1 win over Northern Ireland in May 1977. A week later came another Channon goal against Scotland - this time from the penalty spot - but this proved an infamous England defeat as the Scots won 2–1 and their fans invaded the Wembley pitch in celebration, ripping up clods of souvenir turf and pulling down one of the crossbars.\n\nAfter an ill-fated move to Manchester City affected his form, Ron Greenwood chose to omit him from the starting line-up when England played the crucial World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg in October 1977. England won 2–0 and, despite victory over Italy in the last game of the campaign, the goals record was insufficient to take them to the World Cup. Channon was not selected for his country again; his international career ended with 46 appearances and a healthy 21 goals. England's failure to qualify for three major international tournaments during Channon's career leaves him as the most-capped player never to have been named to a World Cup or European Championships squad. As of 17 July 2018, he remains joint 18th in the all-time England scorers list, level with Kevin Keegan and Steven Gerrard.\n\nSouthampton\n\nNorwich City\n\nChannon always had an interest in horse racing during his football career. After retiring from full-time professional football in 1986, he began working as an assistant trainer, before becoming a licensed trainer in his own right in 1990. He initially had ten horses.\n\nHe then moved to the West Ilsley stables near Newbury, formerly owned by the Queen, and began to increase his number of horses, eventually ending up with almost 200.\n\nIn 2002, he ended the season with 123 winners, topping the 100-mark for the first time in his career. He is one of the sport's most respected trainers, though has yet to produce a winner of one of the British Classic Races. In May 2012, he produced his first Classic winner when Samitar took the Irish 1,000 Guineas.\n\nAmong owners who have had their horses with Channon are old colleagues and acquaintances from his footballing days, including Kevin Keegan, Alan Ball, Chris Cattlin and Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nGreat Britain\n\nCanada\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nOn 27 August 2008, Channon was involved and injured in a motorway accident on the M1. He was travelling from the Doncaster Sales to his West Ilsley stables in Berkshire when the accident happened. Channon was reported to have suffered a punctured lung and broken arm and jaw.\n\nDuring an interview with Clare Balding broadcast on BBC One on 3 January 2009, Channon spoke about how, as a result of the broken jaw, he was subsequently fitted with metal plates in his face. Bloodstock agent and friend Tim Corby died in the accident.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1971828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971828", "title": "Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi", "text": "Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi\n\nThe Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi (; ) is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Order of Friars Minor Conventual in Assisi, a town in the Umbria region in central Italy, where Saint Francis was born and died. It is a Papal minor basilica and one of the most important places of Christian pilgrimage in Italy. With its accompanying friary, Sacro Convento, the basilica is a distinctive landmark to those approaching Assisi. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2000.\n\nThe basilica, which was begun in 1228, is built into the side of a hill and comprises two churches (known as the Upper Church and the Lower Church) and a crypt, where the remains of the saint are interred. The interior of the Upper Church is an important early example of the Gothic style in Italy. The Upper and Lower Churches are decorated with frescoes by numerous late medieval painters from the Roman and Tuscan schools, and include works by Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti and possibly Pietro Cavallini. The range and quality of the works give the basilica a unique importance in demonstrating the outstanding development of Italian art of this period, especially if compared with the rest of Christian Europe.\n\nThe Franciscan friary (Sacro Convento) and the Lower and Upper Basilicas () of Francis of Assisi were begun in honor of this local saint, immediately after his canonization in 1228. Simone di Pucciarello donated the land for the church, a hill at the west side of Assisi, known as \"Hill of Hell\" () where previously criminals were put to death. Today, this hill is called \"Hill of Paradise\".\n\nOn 16 July 1228, Francis was canonized by Pope Gregory IX in Assisi, and he laid the foundation stone of the new church the following day, although construction may already have been begun. The construction having been begun at his order, the Pope declared the church to be the property of the papacy. The church was designed by Maestro Jacopo Tedesco, who was in those days the most famous architect. The construction was supervised by Brother Elias of Cortona, one of the first followers of Saint Francis and the former Vicar General of the Order under Saint Francis. The Lower Basilica was finished in 1230. On Pentecost 25 May 1230, the remains of Saint Francis were brought in a solemn procession to the Lower Basilica from its temporary burial place in the church of San Giorgio (St. George), now the Basilica of Saint Clare of Assisi. The burial place was concealed for fear that St Francis' remains might be stolen and dispersed. The construction of the Upper Basilica was begun after 1239 and was completed in 1253. Both churches were consecrated by Pope Innocent IV in 1253.\n\nPope Nicholas IV, a former Minister-General of the Order of Franciscans, raised the church to the status of Papal Church in 1288. The Piazza del Loge, the square leading to the church, is surrounded by colonnades constructed in 1474. They housed the numerous pilgrims flocking to this church. In 1818, the remains of Saint Francis were rediscovered beneath the floor of the Lower Basilica. In the reign of Pope Pius IX the crypt was built so that the faithful might visit the burial place of the saint.\n\nOn 27 October 1986 and January 2002, Pope John Paul II gathered in Assisi with more than 120 representatives of different religions and Christian denominations for a World Day of Prayer for Peace.\n\nOn the morning of September 26, 1997, two earthquakes hit that region of Italy in rapid succession, registering 5.6 and 6.1 respectively on the Richter Scale. There was widespread devastation and many ancient buildings were destroyed or damaged. While a group of specialists and friars were inspecting the damage to the Basilica of Saint Francis, an aftershock shook the building, causing the collapse of the vault. Two Franciscan friars who were among the group and two of the specialists were killed. Much of the cycle of frescoes of the life of Saint Francis by Giotto in the Upper Church of the Basilica were slightly damaged whereas those of the sections of the vault which collapsed were almost entirely destroyed. The church was closed for two years for restoration. The collapse was captured on tape.\n\nThe church was designed by Maestro Jacopo Tedesco on two levels, each of which is consecrated as a church. They are known as the \"Basilica superior\" (The Upper Basilica), generally called \"The Upper Church\" and the \"Basilica inferior\" (The Lower Basilica), generally called \"Naruto\". The Lower Church was structurally a large crypt supporting the upper one. In the 19th century a lower crypt was constructed beneath the basilica. Architecturally, the exterior of the basilica appears united with the Friary of St. Francis, since the lofty arcades of the latter support and buttress the church in its apparently precarious position on the hillside.\n\nThe architecture is a synthesis of the Romanesque and Gothic styles, and established many of the typical characteristics of Italian Gothic architecture. As originally built, both upper and lower churches had a simple cruciform plan with an aisle-less nave of four square bays, a square crossing, a transept that projected by half a bay on each side, and an apse, the lower being semicircular and the upper polygonal. To the left of the church stands a free-standing bell tower of Romanesque design.\n\nThe Lower Church was built entirely in the Romanesque style, having low semi-circular ribbed cross-vaults over the nave and barrel vaults over the transept arms. However, the space has been greatly extended with a number of lateral and transept chapels added between 1350 and 1400. The main entrance to the nave is through an ornate Gothic doorway built between 1280 and 1300, and later enclosed with a simple Renaissance style porch of 1487 by Francesco di Bartolomeo da Pietrasanta (d. 1494). Set in the tympanum of the Gothic doorway is an ornate rose window which has been called \"the eye of the most beautiful church in the world\" \n\nThe Upper Church has a façade of white-washed brick divided into two horizontal zones of about equal height, and with a simple gable of height equal to the lower zones. There is a single large doorway in the Gothic style, divided by a column and with a rose window set in the tympanum above the two cusped arches. Above the door, in the second zone is a large and ornate rose window in which most of the decorative details are Romanesque in style. Surrounding it are carved the symbols of the Four Evangelists, combining with the window to create a square composition. Above it in the gable is an ocular window. To the left of the façade and visible from both the forecourts of the Upper Church and the Lower Church is the Benediction Loggia in the Baroque style which was built in 1754, when the church was raised to the status of basilica.\n\nInternally, the Upper Church maintains Brother Elias' original simple aisleless cruciform plan. Like the Lower Church, there is a nave of four bays with ribbed cross-vaulting. Unlike that of the Lower Church, it is only the diagonal ribs which are of semi-circular form. The transverse ribs are pointed in the Gothic manner, and thus rise to the full height of the wider diagonal ribs. Each group of ribs springs from a group of clustered columns. Externally the columns and vault are supported by stout buttresses of semi-circular plan. Unlike the Lower Church, the transepts also have ribbed vaulting.\n\nThere are tall Gothic windows with Geometric tracery in each bay of the nave and in the polygonal apse of the chancel. The windows of the apse are believed to have been created by German craftsmen active around Assisi at the end of the 13th century. The windows on the left hand side of the nave were made by a French workshop (1270), while those on the right hand side are attributed to the workshop of Maestro di San Francesco. These stained glass windows are among the best examples of 13th-century Italian glasswork.\n\nAs is characteristic of Italian church architecture, the main decorative feature, and the main medium used for conveying the Church's message is fresco, rather than stained glass. The earliest frescoes are some of those in the Lower Church. The work proceeded with a number of different projects and appears to have involved numerous artists, some of whom are as renowned as Cimabue and Giotto, but many of whom are no longer known by name.\n\nThis bright and spacious basilica consists of a single four-bay nave with cross-vaulted ceiling bordered with patterns of crosses and leaves, a transept and a polygonal apse. The four ribbed vaults are decorated alternately with golden stars on a blue background and paintings. The second vault is decorated with roundels with busts of \"Christ\" facing \"Saint Francis\" and the \"Virgin\" facing \"Saint John the Baptist\". The entrance vault gives us the \"Four Latin Doctors of the Church\": St Gregory facing St. Jerome and Saint Ambrose facing St. Augustine. These are ascribed to the Isaac Master.\n\nThe choir has 102 wooden stalls with carvings and marquetry by Domenico Indovini (1501). In their centre, on a raised platform, stands the papal cathedra.\nThe west end of the transept and the apse have been decorated with many frescoes by Cimabue and his workshop (starting in c. 1280). The magnificent \"Crucifixion\", with Saint Francis on his knees at the foot of the Cross, stresses again the veneration of the Passion of Christ by Saint Francis. The frescoes of Cimabue soon suffered from damp and decay. Due to the use of lead oxide in his colours and to the fact that the colours were applied when the plaster was no longer fresh, they have deteriorated and have been reduced to photographic negatives.\n\nPrior to him there had been some decorations in the upper right hand section of the transept by an (anonymous) Northern Master, probably an English artist (1267–1270). He realized the two lunettes and the roundels on the west wall with paintings of the \"Angel\" and the \"Apostles\". Another (anonymous) master, the Roman Master, painted the \"Isaiah\" and the \"David\" and the remainder of the wall under the eastern lunette.\nThe upper part on both sides of the nave, badly damaged by the earthquake of 1997, was decorated in two rows with in total 32 scenes from the Old Testament (starting with \"Creation of the World\" and ending with \"Joseph forgives his brothers\") and the New Testament (from the \"Annunciation\" to \"The Women at the Tomb\"), while the upper register of the entrance wall is covered with two frescoes \"Pentecost\" and \"Ascension of Jesus\". Since it took about six months to paint one bay of the nave, different Roman and Tuscan masters, followers of Cimabue, have performed this series of scenes such as Giacomo, Jacopo Torriti and Pietro Cavallini.\n\nThe two frescoes of the life of Isaac (\"Isaac blesses Jacob\" and \"Esau in front of Isaac\") in the middle register of the third bay, are traditionally ascribed to the young Giotto (1290–1295) (previously wrongly ascribed to Cimabue by Vasari). But even this has been controversial. Many critics esteem these the work of the anonymous Isaac Master and his workshop. Deducing from stylistic details, attesting to his Roman background, some think that the Isaac Master may have been Pietro Cavallini or a follower. Pietro Cavallini had painted around 1290 a similar fresco \"Isaac blessing Jacob\" in the convent of the church Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome. The position of the resting Isaac looks like the same position of the Virgin in Cavallini's mosaic \"Birth of the Virgin\" in the apse of the church Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome. The Isaac Master is considered one of the first practitioners of the true fresco (\"buon fresco\") technique, which revolutionized mural painting for the subsequent centuries.\nBut the most important decorations are the series of 28 frescoes ascribed to the young Giotto along the lower part of the nave. Each bay contains three frescoes above the dado on each side of the nave, two frescoes in the east galleries beside the entrance, and two more on the entrance wall. Giotto used the \"Legenda Maior\", the biography of Saint Francis by Saint Bonaventure (1266) to reconstruct the major events in the life of Saint Francis. The prototype for this cycle may have been the (now lost) Saint Francis cycle by Pietro Cavallini in the church San Francesco a Ripa in Rome. The paintings are as vivid as if Giotto had been a witness to these events. According to Vasari, they were executed in the period between 1296 and 1304.\n\nHowever the authorship of Giotto is disputed, due to the ambiguous attributions given in early descriptions of this work. Many Italian critics continue to support the authorship of Giotto and his workshop. But because of small differences in style with the frescoes of Isaac, it is thought that several or even all of these frescoes were painted by at least three separate painters, using the original concept of Giotto : the Master of Legend of Saint Francis (the principal painter and probable supervisor of the cycle), the Master of the Obsequies of Saint Francis and the Cecilia Master.\n\nThe first span of the ceiling is decorated with frescoes of the \"Four Doctors of the Church“ ( Jerome, Augustine, Gregory and Ambrose), attributed either to a young Giotto or to one of his followers. The third span presents four heart-shaped medallions of the Christ, Mary, John the Baptist and Francis, painted by Jacopo Torriti.\n\nThe cuspidate façade of the upper basilica has a portal in Gothic style with twin doors and a beautiful rose window.\nBrother Elias had designed the lower basilica as an enormous crypt with ribbed vaults. He had acquired his experience by building huge sepulchres out of hard rock in Syria.\n\nThe doors are surmounted by a large rose window, flanked by two smaller ones, called \"the eye of the most beautiful church in the world\" The decorations on the left wooden door were executed by Ugolinuccio da Gubbio (circa 1550) and those on the right door by an anonymous Umbrian artist (1573). They portray stories from the lives of Saint Francis, Saint Clare, Saint Louis and Saint Anthony. On the left wall of the porch stands the bust of Pope Benedict XIV who granted this church the title of Patriarchal Basilica and Cappella Papale. Pope Benedict XVI’s theological act in 2006 of renouncing the title of \"Patriarch of the West\" has had the consequence of the basilica changing its name to that of the Papal Basilica of St. Francis.\n\nEntering the lower basilica, one sees at the other side of the vestibule the chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, erected about 1270. It was enlarged by Gattapone da Gubbio and decorated at the expense of Cardinal Egidio Albornoz, papal legate in charge of the Papal States (from 1350 to 1367). He was initially buried here but his body was later transferred to Toledo, Spain. The frescoes with the eight episodes from the life of Saint Catherine were painted in 1368–1369 by ‘Andreas pictor de Bononia’. This painter, called Andrea, is most probably Andrea de’ Bartoli (c. 1349 – 1369), the court artist of Albornoz (and not Andrea da Bologna, as usually, but wrongly, attributed). The saints in this chapel were painted by Pace di Bartolo d'Assisi (1344–1368). The stained glass windows are the work of Giovanni di Bonino of Assisi (mid-14th century).\n\nOn the left side of the entrance is the small Chapel of St. Sebastian with a canvas by Giorgetti and episodes of the life of the saint on the walls painted c. 1646 by G. Martelli (Irene taking care of St. Sebastian; St. Sebastian before Domitian). The left wall of this chapel is decorated by some paintings by Ottaviano Nelli (15th century) and a painting of Saint Christopher (Umbrian School, 14th century).\n\nOn the right side of the entrance there are two monuments by anonymous artists: in the first span, the mausoleum of Giovanni de' Cerchi, surmounted by an early 14th-century porphyry vase (a gift of a queen of Cyprus) and the mausoleum of John of Brienne, king of Jerusalem and emperor-regent of Constantinople. Above this last burial monument stands a statue of the Blessed Virgin and on its left the figure of a crowned woman seated on a lion, made by Cosmatesco (1290).\n\nThe badly deteriorating frescoes on the walls and the vaults of the third section of this entrance are the work of Cesare Sermei and G. Martelli (1645). The chapel on the right side of the third section is dedicated to St. Anthony the Abbot. The niches in the wall contain the burial monuments of the Governor of Spoleto (by then part of the Papal States) Blasco Fernandez and his son Garcia, both assassinated in 1367 (anonymous local artist, 14th century).\n\nThe lower basilica consists of a central nave with several side chapels with semi-circular arches. The nave is decorated with the oldest frescoes in the church by an unknown artist, called Maestro di San Francesco. They feature five scenes from the \"Passion of Christ\" on the right side, while on the left side equally five scenes from the \"Life of St. Francis\". By this juxtaposition, the Franciscans wanted to contribute to the idea of their founder as a second Christ.\n\nThey are connected by a low blue-painted ceiling decorated with golden stars. Most images on the lower walls have decayed to leave almost no trace, except on the right wall fragments of \"Virgin and Child with an Angel\" by Cimabue.\n\nThese frescoes, executed in tempera on dry plaster, were completed about 1260–1263. They are considered by many as the best examples of Tuscan wall paintings prior to Cimabue. As the popularity of this church increased, side chapels for noble families were added between 1270 and 1350, destroying the frescoes on the opened walls.\n\nThe first chapel on the left is the San Martino Chapel, dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It was built by the Franciscan Cardinal Gentile Portino da Montefiore and was decorated between 1317 and 1319 with ten frescoes depicting the saint's life by Simone Martini. This dedication most likely referred to the Cardinal's position as Cardinal-Priest of the Basilica of St. Martin \"ai Monti\" in Rome, and was intended to be his burial place. It was probably incomplete at the time of Montefiore's death (October 1312), thus he was interred in the neighboring Chapel of St. Louis. Martini also painted a triptych depicting the \"Madonna and Child with Two Hungarian Royal Saints\" with a row of five attendant saints in the St. Elizabeth Chapel (southern arm of the transept). These are among the greatest Martini's works and the finest examples of 14th-century painting. Over time, however, his use of lead paint has led to the darkening of several sections of these works.\n\nThe other chapel on the left is dedicated to St. Peter of Alcantara.\n\nThe chapels on the right are dedicated to Saints:\n\nThe nave ends in a richly decorated semicircular apse, preceded with a transept with barrel vaulting.\n\nThe frescoes in the right transept depict the childhood of Christ, partly by Giotto and his workshop and the \"Nativity\" by the anonymous Maestro di San Nicola. The lowest level shows three frescoes representing St. Francis posthumously intervening in favour of two children. These frescoes by Giotto were revolutionary in their time, showing real people with emotions, set in a realistic landscape.\nOn the transept wall Cimabue painted an image of \"Our Lady enthroned and Saint Francis\" (1280). This is probably the nearest likeness existing, showing the actual appearance of Saint Francis. This static painting in Gothic style is in stark contrast with the lively frescoes of Giotto.\n\nThis Chapel of Saint Nicholas of Bari, at the northern end of the transept, was commissioned by the papal legate Cardinal Napoleone Orsini and it contains the tomb of the cardinal's brother, Giovanni Orsini, who died between 1292 and 1294 . The funerary monument is set in a niche above the altar, with the recumbent effigy of a young man placed inside a mortuary chamber and flanked by two angels. The reliefs were carved by an Umbrian sculptor, probably of local origin. Between the tomb and the stained glass window appears a frescoed triptych attributed to Giotto's school, representing the Madonna and Child with Saint Francis and Nicholas . The cycle decorating the walls of the chapel, completed by 1307, comprises twelve scenes painted on the ceiling and on the walls illustrating the life and miracles of St Nicholas A scene of the chapel's dedication is painted above the arch of the entrance on the southern wall: the Redeemer receives the homage of Giovanni Orsini, presented by St. Nicholas, and of Napoleone Orsini, presented by Saint Francis. The stained glass windows show Cardinal Napoleone presented to Christ in the summit and his brother presented to Saint Nicholas in the zone below. At the southern end of the transept cardinal Orsini commissioned another chapel, dedicated to St John the Baptist, which was probably originally built for the tomb of Napoleone Orsini himself, but the cardinal was never buried there and the tomb remained empty . The parallel architectural arrangement of both Orsini chapels suggests that they were conceived together. However, the decorations of the chapel dedicated to Saint John the Baptist were never finished . Pietro Lorenzetti ( or his workshop) executed a frescoed triptych with a Madonna and Child with Saints John the Baptist and Francis.\n\nThe left transept was decorated by the Sienese painter Pietro Lorenzetti and his workshop between 1315 and 1330 (attributed by Vasari to Pietro Lorenzetti and also (wrongly) to Giotto and Puccio Capanna) . This cycle of tempera frescoes are his masterworks. They depict six scenes from the \"Passion of Christ\". The fresco of \"Deposition of the Cross\" is especially emotional. There were about 330 work-stages needed to complete this cycle. Beneath the monumental \"Crucifixion\" scene, Pietro Lorenzetti has executed a fresco of the Madonna and Child, accompanied by Saints John the Evangelist and Saint Francis (the so-called \"Madonna dei Tramonti\"). The fresco is accompanied by a frescoed niche containing the liturgical implements and a fictive bench.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the \"Childhood\" and the \"Passion\" frescoes emphasizes the parallel between the \"passion\" of Christ and the \"compassion\" of St. Francis.\nThe papal altar in the apse was made out of one block of stone from Como in 1230. Around the altar are a series of ornamented Gothic arches, supported by columns in different styles. The fine Gothic walnut choir stalls were completed in 1471 by Apollonio Petrocchi da Ripatransone, with the help of Tommaso di Antonio Fiorentino and Andrea da Montefalco.\n\nOnce featuring frescoes depicting an allegory of the Crucifixion by Stefano Fiorentino (destroyed in 1622), the walls of the apse are now covered with a \"Last Judgment\" by Cesare Sermei di Orvieto (1609–1668).\n\nThe paintings in the lunettes of the vaults (1315–20) depict the \"Triumph of St Francis\" and three allegories of \"Obedience\", \"Poverty\" and \"Chastity\" by the so-called Maestro delle Vele (Master of the Assisi vaults), a pupil of Giotto (about 1330).\n\nThe stained glass windows in this lower basilica are attributed to Giovanni di Bonino and his workshop.\n\nHalfway down the nave one can descend into the crypt via a double stairway. This burial place of Saint Francis was found in 1818. His remains had been hidden by Brother Elias to prevent the spread of his relics in medieval Europe, a story told by Jon M. Sweeney in \"The Enthusiast\". By order of Pope Pius VII a crypt was built under the lower basilica. It was designed by Pasquale Belli with precious marble in neo-classical style. But it was redesigned in bare stone in neo-Romanesque style by Ugo Tarchi between 1925 and 1932.\n\nThe ancient stone coffin with iron ties is enshrined in an open space above the altar. In 1934 his most faithful brothers were entombed in the corners of the wall around the altar: Brother Rufino, Brother Angelo, Brother Masseo and Brother Leo.\n\nAt the entrance of the crypt, an urn with the remains of Jacopa dei Settesoli was added to the crypt. This woman of Roman nobility, affectionately referred to as \"Brother Jacoba\", was the most faithful friend and benefactress of Saint Francis. She was at his side in the Porziuncola at the hour of his death.\n\nNext to the basilica stands the friary Sacro Convento with its imposing walls with 53 Romanesque arches and powerful buttresses supporting the whole complex. It towers over the valley below, giving the impression of a fortress. It was built with pink and white stone from Mount Subasio. It was already inhabited by the friars in 1230. But construction took a long time, with as result different styles intermingling : Romanesque with Gothic style.

(27 February 1830 – 18 April 1897), was an American Presbyterian pastor, Christian leader and author. Dr. Brookes led congregations in Ohio and Missouri during a career spanning 43 years. He became a leader among his peers in the Niagara Bible Conference which led to editing \"The Truth: or, Testimony for Christ\", a periodical. His legacy is also found in the many books, booklets and tracts he produced.\n\nBrookes was born in Pulaski, Tennessee, February 27, 1830, into a family descending on both sides from clergymen. When he was very young, his father, also a Presbyterian minister, died. Brookes made his way to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he graduated in 1853. He had brief studies at the Princeton Theological Seminary where he refused financial assistance. When he \"was compelled to stop his theological studies on account of lack of means,\" he returned to Ohio. After becoming established in Saint Louis, he received the honorary Doctor of Divinity in 1864 from both the University of Missouri and Westminster College (Missouri).\n\nSoon after returning to Ohio, on April 20, 1854, James Hall Brookes was ordained and installed as the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Dayton. Soon he received a call to the Second Presbyterian Church in St. Louis, preaching there for the first time on February 18, 1858. A new congregation was \"colonized\" in 1864 by members from Second Presbyterian to a location at Walnut & 16th Streets where a new edifice was built. Brookes became the pastor of the resulting Walnut Street Presbyterian Church. This congregation relocated in 1879 to a new church building at the corner of Washington and Compton streets, becoming the Washington and Compton Presbyterian Church, where Brookes remained until his death on Easter Sunday, April 18, 1897. \n\nBrookes had a deep knowledge of the Bible's original languages, an excellent memory, and continually read and studied the Bible. He believed the Bible to be perfect, inerrant, and therefore infallible and immutable. This remarkable knowledge was coupled with his ability to communicate in a highly effective manner. Benjamin B. Warfield, then professor of theology at Princeton Seminary, wrote of Brookes: \"Large in figure, commanding in carriage, fluent and forceful in speech, fired with intense convictions, infused with emotion, whether in pulpit or on platform his oratory not only caught the attention but dominated the feelings and controlled the convictions of his audience ... [He had] the voice of a lion and the vehemence of an Elijah ... His was no anæmic (sic) Christianity.\"\n\nBrookes was a premillennialist, believing that nowhere in the New Testament is there “so much as a hint of the millennium . . . preceding the personal [Second] coming of Christ.” During this thousand year period, Christ will reign and “Israel will see the fulfillment of its covenants that were unconditionally promised in the Old Testament.” The millennium will follow the “resurrection and rapture“ of believers and a period of “culminating wickedness” before Christ returns with his church to reign over the earth. \n\nJames Hall Brookes was considered a “founding father” of dispensationalism in the United States along with men like Dwight L. Moody, Adoniram Judson Gordon, C. I. Scofield, William Eugene Blackstone, and Arno C. Gaebelein. In the forward to the \"Dictionary of Premillennial Theology\", Mal Couch writes “Not all premillennialists are dispensationalists, but all dispensationalists are premillennialists.” Among their beliefs, dispensationalists hold that the Bible is inerrant, verbally inspired, and must be consistently interpreted with a normal literal-grammatical-historical hermeneutic, views that were foundational for Brookes.\n\nBrookes led the Niagara Bible Conference for many years which “helped to spread Dispensationalism across America.” Premillennial and dispensational beliefs became incorporated in the 1878 confession of faith (Niagara Creed) that was largely written by Brookes and adopted by the Niagara Bible Conference. \n\nDr. Brookes was a prolific author, writing more than 200 books, booklets, tracts and journal articles. He was a well-known Bible teacher and the editor of \"The Truth or Testimony for Christ\", a periodical which served, along with the journal \"Watchword\", as the official organ of the premillennial movement until his death in 1897.  Many of Brookes's writings are available digitally and as reprints. Following are a sample.\n\n\nIn 1854, after returning from his brief study at Princeton Theological Seminary and accepting the call to ministry at First Presbyterian Church of Dayton, Ohio, Brookes married Susan Ann Oliver. They had five daughters. Etta Oliver Brookes lived from 1856 to 1872. Susan Mary Brookes (1861–1936) married Selden P. Spencer, who became a U.S. Senator. Sarah Lacy Brookes (1864–1886) married Ethelbert Dudley Warfield, who became president of Miami University. Judith Bertha Brookes (1866–1905) married Harry French Knight, a St. Louis financier. Olive J. Brookes (1872–1930) married David Riddle Williams who authored the 1897 . Olive's second husband was Rev. Harris H. Gregg. Dr. Brookes died in 1897 on Easter Sunday; his wife, Susan, died in 1910. Both Dr. and Mrs. Brookes along with all of their children except Judith are buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, Saint Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe Saint Louis Bible Training School for Lay Workers was established in Saint Louis in 1909. Subsequently, the school was renamed in honor of Dr. Brookes. It was known as Brookes Bible Institute for many years. Following its accreditation, the name was changed to Brookes Bible College. The college is now located in Saint Ann, Missouri, a suburb of Saint Louis.\n"}

{"id": "1971849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971849", "title": "Hierarchical storage management", "text": "Hierarchical storage management\n\nHierarchical storage management (HSM) is a data storage technique that automatically moves data between high-cost and low-cost storage media. HSM systems exist because high-speed storage devices, such as solid state drive arrays, are more expensive (per byte stored) than slower devices, such as hard disk drives, optical discs and magnetic tape drives. While it would be ideal to have all data available on high-speed devices all the time, this is prohibitively expensive for many organizations. Instead, HSM systems store the bulk of the enterprise's data on slower devices, and then copy data to faster disk drives when needed. In effect, HSM turns the fast disk drives into caches for the slower mass storage devices. The HSM system monitors the way data is used and makes best guesses as to which data can safely be moved to slower devices and which data should stay on the fast devices.\n\nHSM may also be used where more robust storage is available for long-term archiving, but this is slow to access. This may be as simple as an off-site backup, for protection against a building fire.\n\nHSM is a long-established concept, dating back to the beginnings of commercial data processing. The techniques used though have changed significantly as new technology becomes available, for both storage and for long-distance communication of large data sets. The scale of measures such as 'size' and 'access time' have changed dramatically. Despite this, many of the underlying concepts keep returning to favour years later, although at much larger or faster scales.\n\nIn a typical HSM scenario, data files which are frequently used are stored on disk drives, but are eventually \"migrated\" to tape if they are not used for a certain period of time, typically a few months. If a user does reuse a file which is on tape, it is automatically moved back to disk storage. The advantage is that the total amount of stored data can be much larger than the capacity of the disk storage available, but since only rarely used files are on tape, most users will usually not notice any slowdown.\n\nHSM is sometimes referred to as tiered storage.\n\nHSM (originally DFHSM, now DFSMShsm) was first implemented by IBM on their mainframe computers to reduce the cost of data storage, and to simplify the retrieval of data from slower media. The user would not need to know where the data was stored and how to get it back; the computer would retrieve the data automatically. The only difference to the user was the speed at which data was returned.\n\nCSIRO Australia's Division of Computing Research implemented an HSM in its DAD (Drums and Display) operating system with its Document Region in the 1960s, with copies of documents being written to 7-track tape and automatic retrieval upon access to the documents.\n\nHSM in the shape of the IBM 3850 Mass Storage Facility was (according to IBM) announced in 1974.\n\nLater, IBM ported HSM to its AIX operating system, and then to other Unix-like operating systems such as Solaris, HP-UX and Linux.\n\nHSM was also implemented on the DEC VAX/VMS systems and the Alpha/VMS systems. The first implementation date should be readily determined from the VMS System Implementation Manuals or the VMS Product Description Brochures.\n\nRecently, the development of Serial ATA (SATA) disks has created a significant market for three-stage HSM: files are migrated from high-performance Fibre Channel storage area network devices to somewhat slower but much cheaper SATA disk arrays totaling several terabytes or more, and then eventually from the SATA disks to tape.\n\nThe newest development in HSM is with hard disk drives and flash memory, with flash memory being over 30 times faster than disks, but disks being considerably cheaper.\n\nConceptually, HSM is analogous to the cache found in most computer CPUs, where small amounts of expensive SRAM memory running at very high speeds is used to store frequently used data, but the least recently used data is evicted to the slower but much larger main DRAM memory when new data has to be loaded.\n\nIn practice, HSM is typically performed by dedicated software, such as IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, Oracle's SAM-QFS, Versity Storage Manager, Quantum, Novell's Dynamic Storage Technology (DST) on Open Enterprise Server (OES) Linux Platform, HPE Data Management Framework (DMF, formerly SGI Data Migration Facility), StorNext, or EMC Legato OTG DiskXtender.\n\nThe deletion of files from a higher level of the hierarchy (e.g. magnetic disk) after they have been moved to a lower level (e.g. optical media) is sometimes called file grooming.\n\nHSM is often used for deep archival storage of data to be held long term at low cost. Automated tape robots can silo large quantities of data efficiently with low power consumption.\n\nSome HSM software products allow the user to place portions of data files on high-speed disk cache and the rest on tape. This is used in applications that stream video over the internet—the initial portion of a video is delivered immediately from disk while a robot finds, mounts and streams the rest of the file to the end user. Such a system greatly reduces disk cost for large content provision systems.\n\n\"Tiered storage\" is a data storage environment consisting of two or more kinds of storage delineated by differences in at least one of these four attributes: price, performance, capacity and function.\n\nAny significant difference in one or more of the four defining attributes can be sufficient to justify a separate storage tier.\n\nExamples:\n\nNote: Storage Tiers are \"not\" delineated by differences in vendor, architecture, or geometry except where those differences result in clear changes to price, performance, capacity and function.\n\n\n"}

This is a linguistic misconception, and is sometimes used as a basis for linguistic prescription. An argument constitutes an etymological fallacy if it makes a claim about the present meaning of a word based exclusively on its etymology.\n\nAn etymological fallacy may involve looking for the true meaning of words by delving into their etymologies, or claiming that a word should be used in a particular way because it has a particular etymology.\n\nAn etymological fallacy becomes possible when a word has changed its meaning over time. Such changes can include a shift in scope (narrowing or widening of meanings) or of connotation (amelioration or pejoration). In some cases, meanings can also shift completely, so that the etymological meaning has no evident connection to the current meaning.\n\nAncient Greeks believed that there was a \"true meaning\" of a word, distinct from a common use. There is evidence that a similar belief existed among ancient Vedic scholars. In modern days, this fallacy can be found in some arguments of language purists.\n\nNot every change in meaning leads to an etymological fallacy, but such changes are frequently the basis of inaccurate arguments.\n\nAn example of a word which has greatly changed its meaning is \"decimation\", which originally referred to reduction by a tenth, but now usually means a drastic reduction or complete destruction. Insisting that only the original meaning is \"true\" constitutes an etymological fallacy.\n\n\n"}

Garcia's parents are both of Puerto Rican descent. Her father John was a United States military pilot, and her mother Janelle (also known as simply Nelly) was a dancer. Garcia and her older sister, Janice, grew up in both Germany and the United States. Garcia spent the summers of her childhood with her extended family in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She began belly dancing at age three. On May 12, 1981, then 7 years old, Garcia appeared on the American television program \"That's Incredible!\" as the world's youngest professional belly dancer. \n\nAs a teenager, Garcia became a prima ballerina with the Wiesbaden Ballet. She graduated from General H.H. Arnold High School in Wiesbaden, Germany.\n\nGarcia first came to the attention of Prince in 1990 when her mother submitted a video cassette of Garcia's performance to a dancer in hopes they would pass the tape on to Prince. Prince met the young dancer within minutes after viewing the video while on tour in Germany. Garcia also describes the process by which she became a part of Prince's performance group, The New Power Generation (NPG), as follows on her official website: \"Mayte's mother convinced some members of the New Power Generation to give her [audition] video to Prince. Ten minutes later, Prince had invited her backstage, and for two years, the two kept in touch. Finally, when she was eighteen, Prince asked her to be a part of the NPG\".\n\nIn 1992, Garcia was hired to dance during his \"Diamonds and Pearls Tour\". She became the focus of his next album, \"Love Symbol\" (1992). Garcia assumed the guise of an Egyptian princess for the concept album and the \"3 Chains o' Gold\" video compilation. She was a member of the NPG, from 1992 to 1996. Afterwards, she remained an associate of the NPG, dancing occasionally during Prince's tours in 1998 and 1999. In 1995, Prince produced an album for her, titled \"Child of the Sun\", for a European release on his NPG Records label. This album had one single released overseas, \"If I Love U 2 Nite\". \n\nIn 1997, Garcia was the artistic director of the New Power Generation Dance Company on their \"Around the World in a Day\" tour. She also directed the music video for \"The One\" for Prince. In addition, Garcia directed music videos for Chaka Khan and Graham Central Station. She choreographed the belly dancing routines for Britney Spears' \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" music video, as well as Spears' performance of the song at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. During this period, Garcia dated drummer Tommy Lee. She sang on his album \"Never a Dull Moment\" (2002) and she toured with him as a dancer.\n\nFilm appearances include the Hindi film \"Dus\" (2005) as a dancer, and \"Firehouse Dog\" (2007). In 2005, she appeared as a flight attendant in the Spanish language film \"El Vacilon\".\n\nGarcia was offered the role of Marilyn in the film \"Just Like A Woman\" (2012) as well as to be its main dance choreographer, but declined due to scheduling conflicts. The role was later given to Sienna Miller.\n\nGarcia has guest starred on various television series, such as 2 Broke Girls, \"Psych\", \"The Closer\", \"Las Vegas\", \"Nip/Tuck\", and \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\". She appeared twice as a reporter on the 2007 ABC television series \"Big Shots\". She had a recurring role on Lifetime's \"Army Wives\" (2008–2009) as Jennifer Connor. She starred on Sí TV's 2004–05 program \"Across the Hall\" with Eric Cubiche. In 2009, she was a judge on the first season of Oxygen's \"Dance Your Ass Off\".

The symptoms began in 2010 and included optic neuritis, resulting in temporary partial vision loss. Her treatment program, along with a healthy diet and exercise regimen, have stopped the MS symptoms from progressing, allowing her to live an active lifestyle and continue working.\n\nIn 1990, 16-year-old Garcia met Prince backstage in Barcelona after he saw a tape of her dancing. After graduating high school in Germany at the age of 17, Prince became her legal guardian. Upon moving to Minneapolis, Prince and members of his team helped set her up with her own apartment. \"At first, I stayed at the Sofitel, then they moved me to a nice little prairie house at the Country Suites, but I couldn't even make a cup of tea there, so they got me an apartment and rented furniture,\" she said. At the age of 19, Prince instructed her to get on birth control thus beginning their sexual relationship. After a four-year courtship, they married on February 14, 1996. \n\nTheir only child, Amiir, was born with Pfeiffer syndrome type 2 on October 16, 1996. He was unable to breathe without a ventilator and died six days after his birth. A week later, the couple were interviewed on \"Oprah\", where they pretended their son was still alive. According to Garcia, they were unable to process his death. \"We believed he was going to come back, that souls come back. We didn't want to acknowledge he was gone,\" she said. Depressed from the loss of her son, Garcia contemplated suicide, but the affection of her dog, Mia, stopped her. After a subsequent miscarriage, their marriage deteriorated and they divorced in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, Garcia briefly dated choreographer Wade Robson. \n\nGarcia dated drummer Tommy Lee from heavy metal band Mötley Crüe for two years.

T. Landsberg and J. N. Dewynne in 1997; they applied belief in the doomsday argument to itself, and claimed that a paradox results.\n\nIf the doomsday argument's lifetime is governed by the principle of indifference and the Copernican principle then based on the length of its current existence, and assuming that it is randomly drawn from a reference class of probabilistic speculations it is 95% certain that it will be refuted before the year 2500.\n\nIf the doomsday argument is not itself subject to these principles then its assumption that the human race's survival-time can be modeled using them appears to be a paradox (to Lansberg & Dewynne).\n\nAlternatively, if the doomsday argument is subject to these presumptions, then as it is expected to expire (be refuted) earlier that its own prediction for the likely survival time of humanity there is a second paradox: The predictions of a theory concerning events to occur after it has been refuted (such as human extinction) are not logically meaningful. Conversely, if the doomsday argument survives until the end of human civilization (in the year 5000, say) then it will have dramatically beaten the odds against the expectations of the Copernican principle. This can create a paradox for an argument based on probability, as shown if future scenarios are broken into three groups:\n\nThe \"quick extinction\" in possibility 1 is considered fairly likely in those doomsday arguments using the number of births as a reference class, but comparing like-for-like we should compare the length of time the doomsday argument survives before refutation with the length of \"time\" the human race survives before extinction. Therefore, J. Richard Gott's (temporal) doomsday argument is used to calculate the probabilities of the three scenarios above:\n\n\nIf the doomsday argument can apply to itself it can be simultaneously right (as a probabilistic argument) and probably wrong (as a prediction).\n\nTherefore, Landsberg and Dewynne argue that it is more likely that the doomsday argument is wrong (even if its logic is correct) than that the human race will become extinct in 9,000 years (which the doomsday argument calculates at around 95% likely). The interesting paradox is that the \"Doomsday argument is probably wrong even assuming it to be completely right\" (in its 95% estimate).\n\nIn 2001 Bradley Monton and Sherrilyn Roush extended this by arguing that Gott's doomsday argument \"inevitably\" refutes itself.\n\nThis \"meta\"-doomsday argument application of the concept to the doomsday argument itself, requires some assumptions that are not universally accepted:\n\n\n A probable paradox reply in \"Nature\" from 23 October 1997 by Lansberg and Dewynne, to Gott's claim that their earlier use of his formula would also apply to the human survival time. (The reply also details the logic of the rebuttal.)\n"}

They are associated with the post-YBA generation of artists.\n\nNoble and Webster attended fine art foundation courses at, Cheltenham Art College (now the University of Gloucestershire) and Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University) respectively. The two first met in 1986 as Fine Art students at Nottingham Trent University, became good friends through shared interests, particularly their tastes in music.\n\nAfter graduating from university in 1989, they moved to Bradford working in residency at the Nicholas Treadwell Art Mill, West Yorkshire, and in 1990–1992 worked in residency at the sculpture studios in Dean Clough. Their time in Bradford had a profound effect on their artistic development, inspiring much of their early work. They later moved to London when Noble began an MA in sculpture at the Royal College of Art, which marked the pair's entrance into the London art world.\n\nTheir first solo exhibition, entitled 'British Rubbish', was at the Independent Art Space (ISA) in 1996. This led to them being invited to participate in numerous exhibitions, including 'Fool's Rain' at the ICA in 1996, in which they showed what they consider to be their first light sculpture; \"Excessive Sensual Indulgence\".\n\nIn 1997, while working for the artists Gilbert and George to support themselves, they developed their signature imagery, experimenting with the assemblage of personal items and household rubbish out of which came their first shadow sculpture, 'Miss Understood & Mr Meanor' This work featured in their solo exhibition, 'Home Chance', mounted in their own Rivington Street studio in London. The exhibition attracted large audiences, including Charles Saatchi, who bought two of the three works on show.\n\nThe artist's work was included in 'Statuephilia – Contemporary Sculptors' at the British Museum, London, 2008–2009 and in 'Apocalypse – Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art' at the Royal Academy London, 2000. They have had solo shows at a number of other galleries in London, and since 2000, they have enjoyed international recognition with solo exhibitions in Athens, Berlin, Boston, Moscow, New York, and Seoul.\n\nTheir work features in a number of public collections, including the National Portrait Gallery, London, the Arken Museum of Modern Art, Denmark and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.\n\nIn 2007, they were awarded the prestigious Arken Prize, and in 2009 they received Honorary Doctorates of Art from Nottingham Trent University, their former college, in acknowledgement of their artistic achievements to date.\n\nThe artists are currently represented by BlainSouthern in London.\n\nTim Noble and Sue Webster's work can be divided into the 'Light Works' and the 'Shadow Works', though Webster does not see them as completely separate. She says:\nThe influence of music on their art, particularly punk rock, has been of great importance to them since they began their earliest collaborations: Says Noble:\nAdds Webster:\nSir Norman Rosenthal, the former Exhibitions Secretary of the Royal Academy, writes:\nThe Shadow Sculptures incorporate diverse materials including household rubbish, scrap metal and taxidermy animals. By shining light onto these assemblages they are transformed into highly accurate shadow profiles of the artists.\n\nDiscussing their shadow works, Webster commented: \"\"Our work is incredibly unsocial. There has to be complete darkness because you need to give the light and then to take it away again.\"\"\n\nTheir first shadow sculpture, 'Miss Understood and Mr Meanor', 1997 (\"right\"), came into existence through experimentation with the assemblage of personal items and domestic trash. The silhouettes are formed by lights shining on mounds of rubbish, which includes broken sunglasses and pin badges for rock bands. In this particular work the artist's heads are severed and impaled on stakes. The work was destroyed in the 2004 Momart warehouse fire, along with a number of other well-known works from the Saatchi Collection.\n\nThrough their shadow sculptures they managed to fuse the abstract and the representational, a pursuit that consumed the likes of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Francis Bacon. This became even more apparent with their second major shadow sculpture, 'Dirty White Trash (with Gulls)', 1998 (\"left\"), which expanded the innovations of 'Miss Understood and Mr Meanor'. This work is composed of a new kind of self-portrait, sculpted out of six months' worth of the artists' rubbish; the remains of everything they needed to survive during the time it took to make the work. A single light source illuminates the pile of rubbish thus casting a portrait in shadow, which contrasts sharply with the materials used to create it; the artists leaning against each other, back to back, enjoying a glass of wine and a cigarette.\n\nJeffrey Deitch, the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, writes:\nAnother work, 'British Wildlife' was created after Noble's father died in 2000. Using his collection of taxidermy animals, it is an assemblage of forty-six birds, forty mammals, and two stuffed fish, including a whole swan and even the pet crow Noble kept as a child. The shadow formed by this mass of animals fittingly depicts back to back busts of the artists in a pose of grief.\n\nIn September 2000, they were invited to participate in 'Apocalypse', the Royal Academy's follow up to the infamous Sensation exhibition of 1997. For this they presented 'The Undesirables', which comprises a mountain of detritus collected from outside Tim and Sue's house with a shadow image of the artists hovering above. The appearance of a huge pile of rubbish in one of the largest galleries within the Royal Academy was intentionally radical and shocking, created to challenge viewers' assumptions about art.\n\nIn 2006, an exhibition of their work was held at the Freud Museum, entitled 'Polymorphous Perverse'.'Black Narcissus', a sculpture made of black silicone casts of Webster's fingers and Noble's penis in various states of arousal, was placed in Sigmund Freud's study next to a bust of Freud himself. When illuminated the sculpture cast a double profile portrait of the artists, illustrating how sexuality influences our perception of reality reflecting the sexuality that Freud discovered at the core of human life. Another work, 'Scarlett', 2006 (see below video on 'External link') was a \"\"worktable on which numerous bizarre mechanical toys are working and seemingly in the process of being made; a nightmarish setting of repressed sexual and sadomasochistic fantasies and transgressions.\"\"\n\nThe light sculptures, created in tandem with their shadow investigations, are constructed out of computer sequenced light-bulbs that perpetually flash, sending out messages of, often simultaneous, love and hate. The sculptures reference the iconic pop culture symbols of Britain and America, recalling carnival shows and signage typical of working-class sea-side Britain, Piccadilly Circus, Las Vegas and Times Square.\n\nAs with almost all of their work, many of the Light Sculptures are meant to be contradictory, and to produce conflicting feelings in the viewer. This is certainly the case with their early light sculpture, 'Toxic Schizophrenia', 1997. The relentlessly flashing heart with a knife stuck through it fuses a Christian emblem with a cliché rock 'n' roll tattoo. As with the shadow sculptures, duality lies at its core; the work represents romance and pain, love and hate, friendship and alienation, negative and positive.\n\nThe same contradictions resonate at the centre of their later work, 'Sacrificial Heart', 2008, a three-dimensional rotating version of 'Toxic Schizophrenia', which, like the earlier work, is both repellent and strangely alluring.'Toxic Schizophrenia (Hyper Version)' was their first permanent public sculpture, unveiled at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver, May 2009.\n\nContradictions and irony abound in the works exhibited at the Gagosian, Beverley Hills exhibition, 'Instant Gratification', 2001. The twenty foot long revision of their original 1997 'Forever' is inextricably linked to the artist's earlier trips to Las Vegas, playing with the traditional connotations of the word, as the constantly flashing lights reinforce the idea of 'forever'.\n\nWith 'A Pair of Dollars' they attempted to form an ironic response to the art market and art fairs, creating what Noble described as a 'vulgar' artwork, to demonstrate their annoyance with this system. However, he has since acknowledged the failure of this irony, due to the huge success of the piece.\n\n'Puny Undernourished Kid & Girlfriend from Hell' (\"Puny Undernourished Kid shown left\"), represents another return to earlier work, as it derives from cartoon-like drawings that Noble and Webster had made of each other ten years before. These large neon figures are covered with neon tattoos of aggressive and forceful statements, clearly demonstrating the influence of punk rock on the artists.\n\n'The Crack' (2004), is one in a series of welded metal sculptures which appear at first glance as abstract works in the tradition of David Smith and Anthony Caro, while they actually work to reverse this abstraction into figuration.\n\n'The Crack', a vertical column-like form, is possibly the most difficult of the artists' shadow works to decipher. Instead of focusing on the usual black silhouettes cast on the wall, the viewer must instead focus on the white space around the shadow, which reveals the naked bodies of the artists facing each other. This perceptual challenge brings to mind Ernst Gombrich's discussion of perception in his famous 1960 book, 'Art and Illusion'. 'The Crack' displays at one moment an abstract shape that is perhaps reminiscent of a heroic mountain landscape by Clyfford Still, with its cracks and gullies; gradually we begin to perceive the full-length naked profiles of our friends approaching each other, nipples touching, as though they are about to make love again for the millionth time.\"\n\nIn 1997, Tim Noble and Sue Webster commissioned a sculptor from Madame Tussauds to help them create a life-size sculpture of themselves as australopithecines. Called 'The New Barbarians' (\"left\"), the work is based upon a diorama at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, which shows a reconstruction of two early ancestors of the human species. The artists produced a version of these figures overlaid with their own facial features. The sculptures are installed so that they stand in isolation in an apparently infinite space. Their hairlessness evokes conflicting connotations; they could be the first humans or the last – cave people, or the survivors of a nuclear holocaust. Thus, the work continues the artist's concern with conflicting themes of impermanence and immortality. A year after beginning 'The New Barbarians' they made another version of the work, 'Masters of the Universe', 1998–2000. This uses the same sculptural model as the earlier work but is covered with hair.\n\nThe 35-foot tall 'Electric Fountain', constructed from steel, neon tubing and 3,390 LED bulbs, was exhibited at Rockefeller Plaza, New York, February 2008. 'Electric Fountain' (\"see 'External links' below for video clip\") represents the artist's take on the world's oldest form of public art, the fountain. Said Webster: \"Electric Fountain mimics the tradition of a fountain as a monument found in public squares around the world, but its magic lies in the emulation of light where water should be.\" The fountain can be seen as both a celebration of contemporary culture and an ambiguous comment on the nature of consumer society, embodying themes that are often present in the duo's work.\n\nIn 2001, Tim Noble and Sue Webster bought a dilapidated early twentieth-century furniture factory in the East End of London, which would become their studio space. The artists commissioned David Adjaye to design the building, which he named 'The Dirty House', a reference to the medium they use in many of their works. The original brickwork was painted a dark brown, offset by two rows of window openings, and a 'floating' roof that appears to hover over the upper level of glazing and recessed decks.\n\nNoble and Webster were married on 7 June 2008. The wedding party was held on board the Queen Elizabeth, the boat that was used for the Sex Pistols' infamous 'Jubilee party'; also held on the same day as the Pistols' party, 31 years later. The service was conducted by their friend and fellow artist Tracey Emin\n\nIt was announced on 4 January 2013, that after 20 years together, Noble and Webster were to divorce.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cherry Hill is home to Baltimore's largest public housing project, Cherry Hill Homes, with over 1000 units, private homes and several other low-income apartments throughout the community.\n\nIn 2014, Baltimore City Public Schools announced that Maritime Industries Academy, a high school in northeast Baltimore, was moving to Cherry Hill. This was done in part to revamp the Herring Run recreational center in Frankford, the school's neighborhood. Most Cherry Hill residents agreed with the decision to move the high school to the area, as they needed a high school for teenage residents to attend, so they can avoid long transportation hours. The high school moving took action for the start of the 2015-2016 school year.\n\nThe only roads leading in or out of the neighborhood are Hanover Street, Potee Street, Cherry Hill Road and Waterview Avenue. The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) serves the highly populated area with the need for public transportation by bus routes 26, 71, and the already noted Baltimore Light Rail at the Cherry Hill light rail stop located on the northwest edge of the neighborhood.\n\nThe Cherry Hill neighborhood was developed fairly recently in Baltimore's history. Like Armistead Gardens the community was founded as a home for African-American veterans returning from both World War II and the Korean War. Cherry Hill was originally planned to be located in the area now known as \"Armsteady Gardens\", the first section of public housing was built in 1948... .\n\nIn the early and mid-1900s, Cherry Hill was home to an encampment of Roma (Gypsies) of Romanian descent. The Roma settled in Cherry Hill because it was undeveloped and on the outskirts of the city. Many of the Roma were in Fortune telling and traveled up and down the East Coast. Due to a series of antiziganist laws passed in the 1920s and 1930s that banned fortune-telling and required a $1,000 fee for nomads to enter the city of Baltimore, the Roma community left Cherry Hill, but soon returned because the laws were rarely enforced.\n\nHarbor Hospital is based in the eastern edge of the neighborhood.\n\nCherry Hill is also home to DeBaufre Bakeries, the maker of local icon Berger Cookies.\n\n"}

{"id": "1971924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971924", "title": "Order of Glory", "text": "Order of Glory\n\nThe Order of Glory () was a military decoration of the Soviet Union established by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on November 8, 1943. It was awarded to soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Red Army as well as to aviation junior lieutenants, for bravery in the face of the enemy.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of all Order of Glory awards was for combat valor in the Second World War (or the Great Patriotic War as it is known across the countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), there are documented instances of awards of the order's lowest class - its third class - for post-war Soviet military operations. Numbering among these were Order of Glory Third Class awards authorized for Soviet operations in support of the Korean War from 1950-1953 as well as for the Soviet military intervention in Hungary in the fall of 1956. A small number of Order of Glory Third Class awards was also made in connection with armed border clashes with the People's Republic of China in 1969.\n\nThe order became defunct with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1992, the Cross of St. George was revived to serve the same purpose of recognizing enlisted personnel bravery.\n\nThe original statute from the 1943 decree establishing the Order stated that: \"the Order of Glory is awarded to privates and sergeants of the Red Army, and to aviation junior lieutenants, who displayed glorious feats of bravery, courage and fearlessness in combat for the Soviet Motherland.\"\n\nThe Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of October 7, 1951 amended the ranks to read: \"privates, corporals and sergeants as well as aviation junior lieutenants.\"\n\nThe Order of Glory, which was modelled closely after the Tsarist Cross of St. George, was divided into three distinct classes. Like the Cross of St. George, a soldier would initially be recommended for the order's lowest class - in the case of the Order of Glory its third class. Subsequent distinct acts of valor could result in the soldier being recommended for the order's two remaining classes - its second and first class - which were awarded sequentially. Soldiers who received each of the order's three classes were referred to as a \"Full Cavalier of the Order of Glory\" (). In Soviet society they were accorded the same rights and privileges as those granted to personnel who had received the Hero of the Soviet Union title. All told, 2,656 Red Army soldiers (including four men who were also awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title as well as four women) would attain Full Cavalier status.\n\nThe Order of Glory was worn on the left side of the chest. In the presence of other USSR orders and medals it was worn immediately after the Order of the Badge of Honor. If worn in the presence of awards of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.\n\nBelow are the specific award criteria for both ground troops and aviators.\n\n\n\nThe badge of the \"Order of Glory\" was a five-pointed star with a central medallion. The order's first class was made of 950 (23 karat) gold; the order's second class was made of silver with a gilt central medallion and the order's third class was made entirely of silver. The central medallion featured the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin, with a red enamelled five-pointed star at its top and a red enamelled scroll at the bottom bearing the word \"GLORY\" (). Laurel branches on each side along the medal circumference stopped just short of the red star. The reverse had the Cyrillic inscription for \"USSR\" () within a ring with a raised rim. The award serial number was either stamped (first class awards) or engraved above the ring on the reverse of the star's upper arm.\n\nThe Order is suspended by a ring through the award's suspension loop to a standard Russian pentagonal mount covered by a 24mm-wide silk moiré ribbon of St George.\n\nThe individuals below were recipients of the Order of Glory.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Aaron is best known for winning the 1973 Masters Tournament. He is also known for an error in the 1968 Masters Tournament, when he entered a 4 instead of a 3 on Roberto De Vicenzo's scorecard, which kept De Vicenzo out of a playoff for the championship.\n\nAaron was born in Gainesville, Georgia. He began playing golf at age 12 and won two Georgia Amateur titles, two Southeastern Amateur events and two Georgia Open crowns, despite not having a golf course in his hometown.\n\nHe attended the University of Florida, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order Fraternity (Beta Zeta Chapter). While he was a Florida student, Aaron played for the Florida Gators men's golf team from 1956 to 1959, was a member of the Gators' 1956 Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship team, and won the individual SEC championship in 1957 and 1958. He lost the U.S. Amateur final to Charles Coe in 1958, was a member of the 1959 Walker Cup team, and won the Western Amateur in 1960. He was recognized as an All-American in 1958 and 1959. Aaron graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1960, and was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\"\n\nAaron turned pro in 1960. His first professional victory came at the 1969 Canadian Open. Although the event is historically considered a PGA Tour event it was not that year. The following year he gained his first PGA Tour victory at the Atlanta Classic. In 1972, he won the Trophée Lancôme in France. Aaron's best money year was 1972, when he finished in ninth place on the PGA Tour money list.\n\nAaron won the Masters Tournament in 1973, which was his one major championship. He also finished in the top ten at the Masters from 1967 to 1970. His only other top ten major championship finishes came at the PGA Championship in 1965 and 1972. In 2000, he made the cut at the Masters at the age of 63, breaking a record previously held by Gary Player.\n\nAaron played for the U.S. team in the Ryder Cup in 1969 and 1973, and had a record of one win, one tie and four losses.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Aaron played on the Senior PGA Tour, winning $3,646,302. The 1992 Kaanapali Classic was his last professional win.\n\nAaron was a student of golf instructor Manuel de la Torre.\n\nAaron is also known for being the playing partner of Argentinian Roberto De Vicenzo for the final round of the 1968 Masters Tournament. On the seventeenth hole, Aaron incorrectly recorded a par 4 on De Vicenzo's scorecard, when his partner had actually scored a birdie 3 for the hole. Because De Vicenzo signed the scorecard without correcting the error, PGA rules required him to stand by the incorrect, higher score. Instead of a De Vicenzo–Bob Goalby playoff for the green jacket, Goalby won the tournament outright due to the technicality.\n\nIronically, Aaron's 4th round playing partner at the 1973 Masters, Johnny Miller, recorded a higher score when keeping Aaron's card. Aaron caught the mistake.\n\nHe was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\n\nPGA Tour playoff record (0–4)\n\nSenior PGA Tour playoff record (0–2)\n\nAmateur\nProfessional\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\nWD = withdrew\nR256, R128, R64, R32, R16, QF, SF = Round in which player lost in match play<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\n\nSource for The Masters: www.masters.com\n\nSource for U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur: USGA Championship Database\n\nSource for The British Open: www.opengolf.com\n\nSource for PGA Championship: PGA Championship Media Guide\n\nSource for 1959 British Amateur: The Glasgow Herald, May 26, 1959, pg. 6.\n\nResults may not be in chronological order\n\n\"Note: The Senior British Open Championship did not become a major until 2003.\"<br>\nNYF = Tournament not yet founded<br>\nDNP = did not play<br>\nCUT = missed the halfway cut<br>\nWD = withdrew<br>\nDQ = disqualified<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place<br>\nYellow background for top-10.\n\nAmateur\n\nProfessional\n\n"}

Nodes that produce information (publishers) create \"topics\" (e.g., temperature, location, pressure) and publish \"samples\". DDS delivers the samples to subscribers that declare an interest in that topic.\n\nDDS handles transfer chores: message addressing, data marshalling and demarshalling (so subscribers can be on different platforms from the publisher), delivery, flow control, retries, etc. Any node can be a publisher, subscriber, or both simultaneously.\n\nThe DDS publish-subscribe model virtually eliminates complex network programming for distributed applications. \n\nDDS supports mechanisms that go beyond the basic publish-subscribe model. The key benefit is that applications that use DDS for their communications are decoupled. Little design time needs be spent on handling their mutual interactions. In particular, the applications never need information about the other participating applications, including their existence or locations. DDS transparently handles message delivery without requiring intervention from the user applications, including:\n\n\nDDS allows the user to specify quality of service (QoS) parameters to configure discovery and behavior mechanisms up-front. By exchanging messages anonymously, DDS simplifies distributed applications and encourages modular, well-structured programs. \nDDS also automatically handles hot-swapping redundant publishers if the primary fails. Subscribers always get the sample with the highest priority whose data is still valid (that is, whose publisher-specified validity period has not expired). It automatically switches back to the primary when it recovers, too.\n\nBoth commercial and open-source software implementations of DDS are available. These include application programming interfaces (APIs) and libraries of implementations in Ada, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Scala, Lua, Pharo and Ruby. \n\nDDS vendors participated in interoperability demonstrations at the OMG Spring technical meetings from 2009 to 2013.\n\nDuring demos, each vendor published and subscribed to each other's topics using a test suite called the shapes demo. For example, one vendor publishes information about a shape and the other vendors can subscribe to the topic and display the results on their own shapes display. Each vendor takes turns publishing the information and the other subscribe.\nTwo things made the demos possible: the DDS-I or Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (RTPS) protocol, and the agreement to use a common model.\nIn March 2009, three vendors demonstrated interoperability between the individual, independent products that implemented the OMG Real-time Publish-Subscribe protocol version 2.1 from January 2009. The demonstration included the discovery of each other's publishers and subscribers on different OS Platforms (Microsoft Windows and Linux) and supported multicast and unicast network communications.\n\nThe DDS interoperability demonstration used scenarios such as:\n\n\nDevelopment of the DDS specification started in 2001. It was developed by Real-Time Innovations, a US government contractor, and Thales Group, a French defense company. In 2004, the Object Management Group (OMG) published DDS version 1.0. Version 1.1 was published in December 2005, 1.2 in January 2007, and 1.4 in April 2015.\nDDS is covered by several US patents, among others.\n\nThe DDS specification describes two levels of interfaces:\n\nOther related standards followed the initial core document.\nThe Real-time Publish-Subscribe Wire Protocol DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol Specification ensured that information published on a topic using one vendor's DDS implementation is consumable by one or more subscribers using the same or different vendor's DDS implementations. Although the specification is targeted at the DDS community, its use is not limited. Versions 2.0 was published in April 2008, version 2.1 in November 2010, 2.2 in September 2014, and 2.3 in May 2019.\n\nDDS for Lightweight CCM (dds4ccm) offers an architectural pattern that separates the business logic from the non-functional properties. A 2012 extension added support for streams.\nA Java 5 Language PSM for DDS defined a Java 5 language binding, referred to as a Platform Specific Model (PSM) for DDS. It specified only the Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) portion of the DDS specification; Additionally, it encompasses the DDS APIs introduced by DDS-XTypes and DDS-CCM.\nDDS-PSM-Cxx defines the ISO/IEC C++ PSM language binding, referred to as a Platform Specific Model (PSM) for DDS. It provides a new C++ API for programming DDS that is more natural to a C++ programmer.\nThe specification provides mappings for the application programming interface (API) specified in DDS-XTypes, and accessing quality of service (QoS) profiles specified in DDS-CCM.\n\nExtensible and Dynamic Topic Types for DDS (DDS-XTypes) provided support for data-centric publish-subscribe communication where topics are defined with specific data structures. To be \"extensible\", DDS topics use data types defined before compile time and used throughout the DDS global data space. This model is desirable when static type checking is useful.\nA Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile specified DDS domains and topics to be part of analysis and design modeling. This specification also defined how to publish and subscribe objects without first describing the types in another language, such as XML or OMG IDL.\nAn interface definition language (IDL) was specified in 2014 independently from the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) specification chapter 3. This IDL 3.5 was compatible with the CORBA 3 specification, but extracted as its own specification allowing it to evolve independently from CORBA.\n\nStarting with DDS version 1.4 in 2015, the optional DLRL layer was moved to a separate specification.\n\n"}

The company was one of the three founding companies of Viking Line. Rederi AB Slite went bankrupt in 1993.\n\nRederi AB Slite was founded by Carl Bertil Myrsten together with his siblings Inga Gattberg, Sven Myrsten and Lars Myrsten in 1947. The oldest brother Robert Myrsten had his own shipping company Rederi AB Robert Myrsten and was not part of Rederi AB Slite. The Myrsten family, from Slite on the island of Gotland, had been in the shipping business since 1867, when Johan Niclas Myrsten founded the dynasty.\n\nIn mid-1950s two newbuilt cargo ships, and were delivered to Slite. In 1959 and 1961 respectively they were rebuilt to be able to load cars and take passengers. These ships were then put on a route between Simpnäs north of Stockholm and Mariehamn on Åland. In 1964 the company's first purpose built ferry was delivered. In the early 1960s there was a heavy competition from several companies on the route Sweden - Åland. This led to a cooperation between Slite and Rederi Ab Vikinglinjen, which later became a part of Rederi Ab Sally.\n\nIn 1966 the marketing company Viking Line was founded and by now Ålandsfärjan Ab, later SF Line, had joined the cooperation. Viking Line initially had three ships, Ålandsfärjan Ab's , Vikinglinjen's and Slite's \"Apollo\". Since the name of the marketing company came from one of the other founding companies, Carl Bertil Myrsten demanded that the colour of Viking Line's ships would originate from his company. The discussion regarding colour ended when Inga Gattberg took her favourite lip stick and made a mark on the contract with the words “This is the colour we are going to use”. All Viking Line's ships were therefore painted in \"Apollo\"s original red colour that now is so characteristic for Viking Line.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, ferry traffic between Sweden and Finland expanded heavily. In 1970, Slite's second was delivered from Jos L Meyer in West Germany. Her sister entered service two years later.\n\nDue to the increasing internal competition between the three companies within Viking Line, the original route between Kapellskär and Naantali was clogged with Viking Line ships during the first years of the 1970s. The companies tried new routes for their increasing fleets. Rederi Ab Sally and SF Line started traffic between Stockholm and Turku, and Sally also acquired two ships for the Stockholm-Helsinki route. Slite in turn chose to start 24-hour cruises between Stockholm and Mariehamn with the venerable SS \"Svea Jarl\", purchased in 1976 from Silja Line and renamed . To finance the purchase, the 1970-built \"Apollo\" was sold.\n\nIn 1979, \"Diana\" was replaced by the new building . For a couple of years, \"Diana II\" serviced on the Stockholm-Turku route but Sally pushed her back to Kapellskär-Naantali with their bigger .\n\nEconomic difficulties plagued Rederi Ab Sally in the early 1980s. Despite having the big \"Viking Sally\" on the Stockholm - Turku route plus two new large ships on the capital route between Stockholm and Helsinki, Sally was not able to invest in more new ships. This left a spot open for Slite and SF Line to take over the capital route. In 1986, Slite's , at the time the largest passenger ferry in the world, was put into service between Stockholm and Helsinki, replacing Sally's the .\n\nIn October 1987 Rederi Ab Sally was sold to Effoa, the main owner of rival company Silja Line. The situation of having the main competitor owning 33% of Viking Line became untenable and Sally's shares of Viking Line were sold to Slite and SF Line. Sally's remaining ship in Viking Line service, the \"Viking Sally\", was chartered to Slite for the next three years.\n\nAround the same time, SF Line and Slite ordered new ships again. Slite's replaced the \"Apollo III\" in 1989 and by 1990 it was time for the \"Viking Sally\" to be replaced with Athena's sister, the . The \"Olympia\" was scheduled for replacement in 1993 when the jewel of the company's crown, the world's largest passenger ferry, was to be delivered.\n\nThe timing of ordering of new expensive cruise ferries couldn't have been worse for Rederi AB Slite. In October 1989, just weeks after the order of the \"Europa\" was signed, the Finnish shipyard Wärtsilä Marine went bankrupt. Wärtsilä had built the \"Athena\" for Slite and was about to finish her sister, the \"Kalypso\". The bankruptcy resulted in an increased cost for the \"Kalypso\", about 200 million SEK.\n\nMatters became worse when the Swedish krona was allowed to float in the autumn of 1992. Because of this, the almost finished \"Europa\" built in Germany, suddenly became 500 million SEK more expensive. Slite became unable to pay for the \"Europa\" when their bank Nordbanken, which at the time had large sums invested in Slite's main rival Silja Line, withdrew their loan guarantees. After the loss of \"Europa\", Slite had lost over 550 million SEK within two years, 200 million due to the increased costs for the \"Kalypso\" and 350 million lost in advance payments for the \"Europa\". Consequently, Slite was declared bankrupt in April 1993.\n\nAll Slite's ships were sold by compulsory auction after the bankruptcy. SF Line made bids on the \"Athena\" and the \"Kalypso\" but lost them to the heavily investing Malaysian cruise company Star Cruises. SF Line became the sole owner of Viking Line and changed its name to Viking Line Ab.\n\nAfter the auction of Slite's ships and other assets, it became clear that the bankruptcy was unnecessary. All the debts could be paid for with the money gained from the ship sales. It has been speculated that Nordbanken did everything they could to break Slite in order to help their financially poor Silja Line. In March 1993 the \"Europa\" entered service for Silja Line as the .\n\nThe company was then forced to sell all of its fleet. One of their largest vessels (MS \"Olympia\") was sold to P&O Ferries where it was renamed \"Pride of Bilbao\". It operated at P&O for 17 years until 2010.\n\nNot a complete list.\n\n\n"}

Tony Bennett sang his interpretation on his prestigious \"The Movie Song Album\" (1966). \nElla Fitzgerald and Joe Pass recorded their version of this song on their Pablo Records album \"Easy Living\". The song has become a jazz standard.\n\nWilliams' version was recorded for Columbia Records. It was released as catalog number 42674. The song reached #9 on the adult contemporary chart and #26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and was the featured track of an album by Williams of the same name, which peaked at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart.\n\nComo's version was recorded for RCA Victor Records. The recording was made on March 19, 1963. The record was issued by RCA Victor as a track on the album, \"The Songs I Love.\" On the \"Cash Box\" chart, where all singles were combined together, the song reached a peak position of #30 in May 1963.\n\nIn 2000, The Lettermen covered the song on their \"Greatest Movie Hits\" album. R&B/soul singer Miki Howard recorded a cover version for her 2008 album, \"Private Collection\". \n\nThe phrase \"days of wine and roses\" is originally from the poem \"Vitae Summa Brevis\" by the English writer Ernest Dowson (1867–1900):\n\n<poem>They are not long, the days of wine and roses:\nOur path emerges for a while, then closes\n"}

The airport has two runways: 04/22 and 10/28. A part of runway 15/33 is used as a taxiway.\n\nThe airport is mainly used to handle helicopters and privately owned aircraft. The Wales Air Ambulance used to operate from the airport but has now moved to a purpose built site\n\nThe airport is also used by corporate aircraft including police, military and naval helicopters.\n\nSeveral small general aviation companies conduct fixed-wing and helicopter pilot training; and parachuting operations; from the airport.\n\nExperience Wales has also recently partnered with Swansea airport to offer a wider variety of experiences found at https://www.experience-wales.co.uk/\n\nLocated on the eastern part of the site is the airport's only terminal building. The control tower is integrated into the terminal building. The airport has two hangars. The fire brigade at Swansea is CAT 1, and able to do CAT 2 on request.\n\nThe airport may be reached via the A4118, running through the Gower Peninsula. Being quite distant from any major routes and having to use mainly suburban roads, it takes approximately 20 minutes to reach from the nearest M4 junction.\n\nSwansea Airport was built on what was originally common land during the Second World War. The aerodrome was declared operational on 15 June 1941 as RAF Fairwood Common, after taking nearly a year to develop. It was built as a day and night fighter station within 10 Group RAF Fighter Command. The aerodrome became a sector station in October 1941, taking on the responsibility for the air defence of South and West Wales including shipping in the Bristol and St George's Channels.\n\nThe aerodrome fulfilled a variety of military roles during the Second World War, with the addition of an Armament Practice Camp in October 1943 which expanded into an Armament Practice Station in July 1945 following which it went into 'care and maintenance' in October 1946. Finally decommissioned by the RAF in spring 1949, private flying started in July 1949 with the formation of Swansea Flying Club at the renamed Fairwood Common Airfield. The airfield hosted a number of air races and motor/motorcycle races but it was not until 1957 that Swansea Corporation allowed Cambrian Airways to run the airport for them on a commercial basis. Renamed Swansea Airport, it was officially opened on 1 June 1957 with Cambrian Airways inaugural flight arriving from Jersey. Then in the following 12 years, a variety of airlines operated through the airport with varying degrees of success. Cambrian Airways operated services to Jersey and Guernsey; and Morton Air Services operated a service to Gatwick. Scheduled regular flights then ceased in 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, only \"ad hoc\" and summer charter flights continued to operate, mainly by Dan Air/Skyways.\n\nThe 1990s saw the arrival of Heli-air Wales to the airport, and so began the era of Helicopter Training in South Wales. In April 2000, Swansea entrepreneur Martin Morgan via his company Jaxx Landing Ltd., bought the remaining lease. Ambitious plans were put in place to upgrade the then run-down facilities. The airport changed ownership again in 2003, when the Morgans sold their interest in the airport to Swansea Airport Limited, owned by Air Wales owner and director Roy Thomas, who was appointed CEO of the airport company.\n\nWith the take over of the airport by Jaxx Landing, activity at the airport began to increase: the Welsh Air Ambulance service based a MBB Bö 105 helicopter at the airport in March 2001. In August 2001, gliders of 636 VGS moved from Aberporth back to Swansea Airport. In March 2016 636 VGS was disbanded and the Wales Air Ambulance helicopter moved to a new base in Dafen, Llanelli at the end of May 2016\n\nAir Wales used the airport between October 2001 and October 2004, offering flights to Dublin, Cork, Amsterdam, Jersey and London. However, the venture was not successful. After 18 months of operation, Air Wales's owner Roy Thomas had invested more than £3.25 million of his personal fortune into the airport. The venture received only one tenth of the passengers needed to make the business viable. The final straw came when the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority demanded that the airport's landing lights be improved at a cost of £350,000. Roy Thomas decided to pull out of Swansea Airport and concentrate Air Wales's operations at Cardiff International Airport instead.\nSince 29 October 2004, there have been no scheduled flights operating from the airport.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011 the airport was the base for the Yak-52 formation aerobatic team 'Team Osprey'. In Spring 2014 a new formation aerobatic team was formed at the airport with Vans aircraft, Team Raven displaying in the 2014 and 2015 air show seasons with 5 aircraft increasing to 6 by mid-July 2016.\n\nThe Welsh Assembly Government is conducting studies into improving the facilities at the airport as part of the transport infrastructure development strategy for the whole of Wales. These improvements may require some public sector support. Development proposals include: a new terminal building, new hangars, upgraded operating facilities, new fencing and a new access road.\n\nThere has been widespread local opposition against the idea of further development of the airport. The main concerns are: the impact on the internationally important Special Area of Conservation which almost surrounds the airport; noise from the increased number of flights at the airport; and the negative impact of the development of the airport on the local scenery, since Gower is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In addition, the undulating and boggy common land beyond the airport perimeter fence to the North East makes extension of the runway (Runway 04/22) difficult.\n"}

{"id": "1971959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971959", "title": "Norrie disease", "text": "Norrie disease\n\nNorrie disease is a rare disease and genetic disorder that primarily affects the eyes and almost always leads to blindness. It is caused by mutations in the \"Norrin cystine knot growth factor (NDP)\" gene, which is located on the X chromosome. In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms, the majority of patients suffer from a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life, and some may have learning difficulties among other additional characteristics.\n\nPatients with Norrie disease may develop cataracts, leukocoria (a condition where the pupils appear white when light is shone on them), along with other developmental issues in the eye, such as shrinking of the globe and the wasting away of the iris. Around 30 to 50% of them will also have developmental delay/learning difficulties, psychotic-like features, incoordination of movements or behavioral abnormalities. Most patients are born with normal hearing; however, the onset of hearing loss is very common in early adolescence. About 15% of patients are estimated to develop all the features of the disease.\n\nDue to the X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, Norrie disease affects almost entirely males. Only in very rare cases, females have been diagnosed with Norrie disease; cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported. It is a very rare disorder that is not associated with any specific ethnic or racial groups, with cases reported worldwide (including cases in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australasia). While more than 400 cases have been described, the prevalence and incidence of the disease still remains unknown.\n\nThe most prominent symptoms initially observed in Norrie disease are ocular (affect the eye). Initial characteristics are usually identified at birth or in early infancy, with parents often noticing abnormal eye features or that their child fails to show a response to light. The first visible finding is leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflection that originates from a mass of disorganized tissue behind the lens. This material, which possibly includes an already detached retina, may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma. However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and unremarkable iris, anterior chamber, cornea and intraocular pressure. Over the first few months of life, complete or partial retinal detachment evolves. From infancy through childhood, the patient may undergo progressive changes in the disease. Disease progression often includes vitreoretinal hemorrhages, the formation of cataracts, deterioration of the iris with adhesions forming between the iris and the lens or the cornea, and shallowing of the anterior chamber which may increase intraocular pressure, causing eye pain. As the situation worsens, there is corneal opacification, where the cornea becomes opaque, and band keratopathy. Intraocular pressure is lost and the globe shrinks. In the last stage of Norrie disease, the globes appear small and sunken in (phthisis bulbi) and the cornea appears to be milky.\n\nAuditory symptoms (affect the ear) are common with Norrie disease. Progressive hearing loss has been reported to occur in 85–90% of patients and onset is generally in childhood and before the patient reaches their mid-20s. Early hearing loss is sensorineural (caused by damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve), mild and asymmetric. By adolescence, high-frequency hearing loss begins to appear. Hearing loss is severe, symmetric, and broad-spectrum by the age of 35 years. However, studies show that while hearing deteriorates, the ability to speak well is highly preserved. The slowly progressing hearing loss is more problematic to adjust to than the congenital blindness for most people with Norrie disease.\n\nIndividuals with Norrie disease can also have cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Developmental delay or learning difficulties are present in about 30 to 50% of males who have Norrie disease. Psycho-social disturbances and poorly characterized behavior abnormalities may also be present. In a study reporting extraocular manifestations in 56 patients with Norrie disease, conditions reported included cognitive impairment (28% of patients), behavioral issues, for example autism spectrum disorder (27% of patients presented with autism or autism-like disorders), neurological features, including seizure disorders and epilepsy (16% of patients reported seizures or seizure history), and peripheral vascular disease (38% of patients).\n\nAdditionally, children with visual impairment have been shown to struggle establishing regular sleep/wake cycles due to reduced light perception impacting on their understanding of night and day; this can impact on the individual’s behavior, mood and cognitive ability. Consistent with this, some case reports of Norrie disease patients have reported the presence of sleep disorders.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease (PVD) has also been associated with Norrie disease. In a study of 56 patients with Norrie disease, 21 patients (38%) reported PVD (including varicose veins, peripheral venous stasis ulcers and erectile dysfunction). Due to the known role of the protein norrin in the vascular development of the eye and inner ear, as well as the association with PVD, norrin is thought to have an important angiogenic role in the body.\n\nNorrie disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the \"NDP\" gene, located on Xp11.4 (GeneID: 4693). It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men will not have the mutation, while all of their daughters will be genetic carriers of the mutation. Female carriers usually show no clinical symptoms, but will pass the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters with the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.\n\nFemales are very unlikely to express clinical signs. However, there have been a few rare cases where females have shown symptoms associated with Norrie disease such as retinal abnormalities and mild hearing loss. Additionally, cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported. One possible scenario that could lead to a female case of Norrie disease is if both of their copies of the \"NDP\" gene bear mutations, which could be the case in consanguineous families or due to a spontaneous somatic mutation. Another explanation for affected females could be skewed X-chromosome inactivation. In this latter case, carrier females with one mutated \"NDP\" allele could have a higher proportion of defective norrin being expressed, leading to the presentation of symptoms of Norrie disease.\n\nNorrie disease is caused by a mutation in the \"Norrin cystine knot growth factor\" gene, also known as the Norrie disease (pseudoglioma) gene or \"NDP\" gene. Mutations could include splicing or mis-sense mutations, as well as partial or full gene deletion. The normal function of the \"NDP\" gene is to produce the instructions for creating a protein called norrin. For the normal development of the eye and other body systems, norrin is believed to be crucial. Norrin also appears to be crucial in the specialization of the cells of the retina and the establishment of a blood supply to the inner ear and the tissues of the retina. The role of norrin in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory function is interfered by the mutation of \"NDP\". This results in an accumulation of immature retinal cells in the back of the eye. When norrin's role in the establishment of blood vessels supplying the eye is disrupted, the tissues cannot develop properly.\n\nNorrin is not only important in the development of the eye. The mutation of the \"NDP\" gene can affect other systems of the body as well. The most severe problems are caused by chromosomal deletions in the region of the \"NDP\" gene, causing the prevention of the gene product, or even that of the neighboring \"MAO\" genes. When the mutations simply change a single amino acid in norrin, the effects are less widespread and severe. However, the location and type of the \"NDP\" mutation does not necessarily determine the degree of severity of the disease, since highly varying clinical signs have been diagnosed in patients carrying exactly the same mutation. Therefore, the involvement of other modifying genes is very likely. On the other hand, if certain structurally important amino acids are changed (e.g. the cysteines forming the putative cystine knot), the clinical outcome has been shown to be more serious.\n\nNorrie disease and other \"NDP\" related diseases are diagnosed with the combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 95% of affected males. Clinical diagnoses rely on ocular findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through 8–10 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris atrophy, shallowing of anterior chamber, and shrinking of the globe. Children with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all.\n\nIn addition to its use for initial diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is used to confirm diagnostic testing (such as diagnosis by ocular examination), for carrier testing females, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 95% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis. Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are submicroscopic deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is linkage analysis, which is used when the first two types are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.\n\nMRI is often used to diagnose the retinal dysplasia that occurs with the Norrie disease. However, the retinal dysplasia can be indistinguishable on MRI from persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, or the dysplasia of trisomy 13 and Walker–Warburg syndrome.\n\nFor families with an existing history of Norrie disease, genetic counselling and \"in utero\" diagnosis of Norrie disease may be considered. \"In utero\" diagnosis has been reported to include genetic testing by amniocentesis and ultrasonography to examine fetal eyes. Confirmation of diagnosis on the first day of life by ophthalmological examination under anesthesia has also been reported in some cases.\n\nOcular, auditory and behavioral management are the most common areas of intervention and treatment for patients with Norrie disease. For ocular (eye) management, often patients already suffer from complete retinal detachment at birth, or by the time of diagnosis, so surgical intervention is often not offered. However, there is some evidence for the benefit of early surgery or laser therapy for cases where retinal detachment is incomplete. Surgery may also be used to treat increased intraocular pressure and in rare cases enucleation (removal) of the eye is considered to control pain.\n\nA high proportion (85–90%) of individuals with Norrie disease experience progressive hearing loss in their second decade of life. In most cases, use of hearing aids has been shown to be effective into middle or late adulthood. For more significantly impaired hearing, cochlear implants may also be considered.\n\n30-50% of individuals with Norrie disease have been reported to present with developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Additionally, behavioral issues have also been reported. Supportive intervention and therapy, for example working with speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, can be used to maximize educational opportunities for these individuals. Furthermore, training of teachers and school counselors on how to best support children with vision and hearing impairment can be extremely beneficial.\n\nRoutine monitoring of individuals with Norrie disease is recommended to best manage the disease. This includes regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist, even when vision is severely compromised. Additionally, due to the high proportion of individuals with Norrie disease who develop hearing loss, regular monitoring of hearing loss is beneficial to allow any hearing loss to be detected early and then correctly managed. More recently, the use of dual sensory clinics has been proposed to provide improved care to patients living with conditions such as Norrie disease. For example, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London are building a new Sight and Sound center, with the aim of improving the patient experience for individuals with conditions such as Norrie disease. The benefits of dual sensory clinics include improved communication between the different health care professionals (HCPs) involved in management of Norrie disease (e.g. ophthalmologists and audiologists) as well as allowing more consistent training of staff on best practices for managing and interacting with individuals suffering from sensory impairment.\n\nIndividuals with Norrie disease can often feel isolated from society due to difficulties in communication. In cases where hearing loss is also experienced, this psychological burden has been shown to increase. For example, a number of Norrie disease patients have been reported to experience transient depression correlating with the onset of hearing loss. Because of this, the provision of emotional support to individuals with Norrie disease can be as important as clinical treatment strategies in terms of improving their quality of life and reducing disease burden.\n\nResearch into understanding Norrie disease and how to improve the lives of those with Norrie disease is ongoing. For example, research is taking place at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London (UCL GOSICH) to study the developmental changes in the ear and eye in Norrie disease, with the hope to understand how to improve current treatment strategies. The group at UCL GOSICH is focusing particularly on the hearing loss aspect of the disease, and whether it might be possible to treat by gene therapy.\n\nIn 1961, a Danish ophthalmologist named Mette Warburg reported on a Danish family that showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first member of the family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the posterior chamber, surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) glial tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. The physician had suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells had already begun to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years. The \"NDP\" gene was previously named the “Norrie disease (pseudoglioma)” gene, which is still used widely when referring to \"NDP\". However, the current approved name for \"NDP\" is “Norrin cystine knot growth factor”.\n\nThere are two patient organizations for people affected by Norrie disease. The Norrie Disease Association (NDA) was founded in 1994 and is a US-based non-profit organization aiming to provide information and support to people living with Norrie disease and their families. The NDA holds a conference on Norrie disease every three years in Boston, US. The Norrie Disease Foundation (NDF) is a UK-based charity established in 2016. The main aims of NDF are to provide support for families and promote pioneering research into Norrie disease. They organize two family days a year where families with Norrie disease can come together to share experiences, meet each other and build relationships and supportive networks. The websites for both patient organizations contain useful information for patients and their families about the disease.\n\nNDA: http://www.norriedisease.org/\n\nNDF: https://norriedisease.org.uk/\n\n"}

It is the labour counterpart of the military Order of the Red Banner. A few institutions and factories, being the pride of Soviet Union, also received the order.\n\nThe Order of the Red Banner of Labour began solely as an award of the Russian SFSR on December 28, 1920. The all-Union equivalent was established by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on September 7, 1928 and approved by another decree on September 15, 1928. The Order's statute and regulations were modified by multiple successive decrees of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, on May 7, 1936, on June 19, 1943, on March 28, 1980, and on July 18, 1980.\n\nThe Order of the Red Banner of Labour can be awarded to citizens of the USSR, to businesses, associations, institutions, organizations, and allied autonomous republics, territories, autonomous regions, districts, cities and other localities; it may also be awarded to persons who are not citizens of the USSR, as well as to enterprises, institutions and organizations located in foreign countries:\n\nThe Order of the Red Banner of Labour could be awarded multiple times to the same recipient for successive deeds and long time merit.\n\nThe Order of the Red Banner of Labour was worn on the left side of the chest and in the presence of other awards of the USSR, was located immediately after the Order of the Red Banner. If worn in the presence of Orders or medals of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence.\n\nThe design of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour evolved over the years. Its original design, called \"type 1\" was amended in 1936, this new variant will be identified as \"type 2\".\n\nThe \"type 1\" Order consisted of a 38 mm wide by 43 mm high silver badge in the shape of a cogwheel, at center, a disc bordered along its entire outer diameter by panicles of wheat. Protruding from under the lower half of the central disc, a red enamelled triangle pointing downwards. On the central disc in the background, a hydro electric dam, at center, a gilded hammer and sickle, at the top, a waving red banner bearing the inscription \"Proletarians of the World, unite!\" (). At the very bottom of the cogwheel, the relief inscription \"USSR\" () on a stylised horizontal shield bisected by a smaller cogwheel meshing into the larger one. On the otherwise plain reverse, a recess at center bearing a threaded post, two rivets used to secure the hammer and sickle and the award serial number engraved on the lower portion opposite the \"USSR\" inscription. The Order was secured to clothing with a threaded screw and nut arrangement. The earlier nuts were 28 mm in diameter, later ones measured 32 mm.\n\nThe \"type 2\" Order also consisted of a silver badge in the shape of a cogwheel, it measured 38 mm wide by 44 mm high. On the lower circumference of the cogwheel, the relief inscription \"Proletarians of the World, unite!\" (), below the cogwheel, a red enamelled relief five pointed star superimposed on a shield from which four short panicles of wheat protrude left and right. At the center, a disc surrounded by a gilded wreath of oak leaves bearing the relief image of a hydro electric dam, below the dam, blue enamelled water, at the center of the disc, the gilded hammer and sickle, from the inner left side of the disc, a gilded mast bearing a waving red enamelled banner protruding from the central disc, covering the upper portion of the cogwheel and protruding past its outer upper edge on which \"USSR\" () is inscribed in gilded letters. Along the outer circumference of the central disc's wreath, white enamelled slots spaced equally on the cogwheel. On the otherwise plain reverse, a concave recess at center bearing a threaded post, eight rivets (only three rivets on the post 1943 variant) used to secure the various parts to the badge and the award serial number engraved on the lower portion below the recess. The Order was secured to clothing with a threaded screw and a 33 mm in diameter nut until 1943 when it was secured by a ring through the medal suspension loop to a pentagonal mount covered by an overlapping 24 mm wide light blue silk moiré ribbon with 4 mm wide dark blue edge stripes.\n\nThe individuals listed below were recipients of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.\n\nThe first recipient of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour of the RSFSR was Nikita Menchukov for saving an important bridge from being destroyed by flowing ice.\n\nOrder of the Red Banner of Labour of the USSR number 1 was presented to the Putilov (later Kirov) Works in Leningrad. The first individual awardees were V. Fedetov, A. Shelagin and M. Kyatkovsky for the rescue of a polar expedition.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour for harvesting a record crop on his family's collective farm in 1949 at age 17, an honor which was very rare for someone so young. He is one of the Order's youngest recipients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1971977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971977", "title": "Island Farm", "text": "Island Farm\n\nIsland Farm, also called Camp 198, was a prisoner of war camp on the outskirts of the town of Bridgend, South Wales. It hosted a number of Axis prisoners, mainly German, and was the scene of the largest escape attempt by German POWs in Britain during World War II. Near the end of the war it was renamed Special Camp XI and used to detain many senior SS military leaders who were awaiting extradition to the Nuremberg trials.\n\nIsland Farm Camp was originally built as a hostel for female workers employed at a munitions factory in Bridgend, but conditions at the hostel were so dreary that the women preferred to travel, as much as , from their homes each day. The camp remained empty until 1943, when it was used to accommodate American troops who would subsequently be involved in the Allied invasion of France.\n\nAfter the invasion the authorities had to find suitable accommodation for large numbers of POWs captured in Europe. The prefabricated concrete huts surrounded by open fields at Island Farm were considered ideal, although the barracks had to be converted and barbed wire fences erected. This work had not been completed by the time the first batch of prisoners arrived, so the prisoners were put to work completing the conversion.\n\nIsland Farm was designated as Camp 198 and was to hold almost 2,000 prisoners. The first POWs were a mixture of Italian and German troops, but the War Office soon decided that the camp was too comfortable for enlisted men and that German officers should be held there. The first officer prisoners arrived in November 1944.\n\nSoon after their arrival at Island Farm the POWs began escape efforts, with two tunnels being dug in the camp. The first was discovered in January 1945, but the second escaped detection and on 10 March 1945, 70 prisoners escaped through a tunnel dug from Hut Nine (the only hut now left standing). The tunnel was about long and breached the perimeter fence. \n\nSome of the techniques used by the inmates were ingenious and not too dissimilar to those in the war film \"The Great Escape\" about Allied POWs. Excavating the tunnels was not easy because of the heavy clay soil upon which the camp was built. Cans, meat tins, and even knives from the canteen were used as digging implements. The soil was hauled out of the tunnel on a makeshift skip and put into kit bags. At first, prisoners carried the soil in their pockets to the long-jump pit or garden plots. Others kneaded clay into balls and dropped them through a hole in a false wall they had constructed in an unused room in one of the huts. To support the tunnel roof, oak benches were stolen from the canteen and bed legs were cut down when supplies of wood were depleted. A ventilation pipeline was made from condensed milk tins; air was forced through by a hand-operated fan. The tunnel even had its own electric lights, tapped off the mains supply. Noise was concealed by chorus singing.\n\nThe escapees were divided into groups, each of which was equipped with a map, homemade compass, and food. Each person in the group also had identity papers, produced in the camp. All these preparations required tremendous organization, yet it is not known who actually organized the escape. For security purposes, each escaper’s identity was known only to the others in his small group. This anonymity protected them against betrayal and prevented discovery of the full extent of the escape.\n\nAt around 10pm on March 10, the prisoners made their move; a few stole the local doctor's car and got as far as Birmingham, at least away, and another group got to the port of Southampton. The prisoners knew their way around through crude but accurate rough drawings of Wales and the surrounding area, mainly of railway lines and principal roads. \n\nIn his book, \"The German Great Escape\", Peter Phillips claims that 84 prisoners actually got out, eclipsing the 76 Allied POWs who broke out of Stalag Luft III; the inspiration for the film \"The Great Escape\". Fourteen were captured very soon afterwards, allowing officials to announce, for propaganda reasons, that only 70 had escaped. All the escapees were eventually recaptured, although this is also disputed by Phillips, who claims that three escapees spotted in Kent were never caught.\n\nOnly three weeks after the escape, on 31 March 1945, the authorities suddenly transferred all 1,600 officers out of Island Farm Camp. It was then designated Special Camp Eleven and was prepared to receive senior German officers, many of whom had been captured in France and were awaiting trial at Nuremberg. In all there were 160 officers holding the rank of general, admiral, or field marshal, including a number of Hitler's closest advisers:\n\nIsland Farm Camp finally closed in 1948, when the last prisoners were returned to Germany.\n\nIn 2016, an archaeology investigation was undertaken of the site to look for the escape tunnel, including surface surveying using lidar and geophysics. An intrusive investigation found the tunnel to be in relatively good condition, still containing the wooden support shoring.\n\nThe following list is in alphabetical order :\n"}

{"id": "1972001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972001", "title": "Wabbit Twouble", "text": "Wabbit Twouble\n\nWabbit Twouble (\"Rabbit Trouble\" in Elmer Fudd's speech impediment) is a \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon starring Bugs Bunny, produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions and released on December 20, 1941 by Warner Bros. Pictures. This is the first of several Bugs Bunny cartoon titles that refers to Elmer Fudd's speech impediment, making the names of Robert Clampett, Sid Sutherland, and Carl Stalling as well as the roles of Story, Supervision, and Musical Direction intentionally misspelled in the credits to receive the perfect match for Elmer's speech impediment.\n\nIn the cartoon, Elmer expects to find rest and relaxation at Jellostone National Park. He mistakenly sets camp in the neighborhood of Bugs' rabbit hole, and Bugs (and a neighboring bear) don't have much leisure in mind. It was the first Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by Robert Clampett, with a story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by Carl Stalling. Sid Sutherland is the only credited animator, although Virgil Ross, Rod Scribner, and Robert McKimson also animated the short. Mel Blanc provided the voices for Bugs and the bear, and Arthur Q. Bryan provided the voice for Elmer.\n\nElmer, driving his Ford Model T jalopy to a Conga beat, makes his way to Jellostone National Park (a pun on Yellowstone National Park) while looking forward to getting some rest. Elmer sets up his campsite by setting a camp fire, an hanging mirror on a tree and, beneath it, a wash basin on a table, hanging a hammock, and pitching his tent. The tent is positioned directly over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole (just as Elmer had arrived, Bugs had posted a sign next to his hole saying 'Camp Here', then had retreated into the lair, covering it with grass as he went). From down there, Bugs breaks down the tent and drags it inside. Elmer reaches in and, in spite of resistance from below, retrieves the tent which is tied in knots. Bugs pops up, welcomes Elmer to Jellostone (\"a restful retreat. Oh brudda!\") and pulls Elmer's hat over his eyes. Elmer reaches in again and tries to yank Bugs out. After several attempts, Elmer pulls his hands out to find that his fingers are tied together. He nails a board over the hole (\"that'll hold 'em alwhight, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\"). However, Bugs simply pushes it open, steps out and mimics Elmer. Bugs balloons up to Elmer's size and repeats what Elmer had said, labeling it \"phooey\". Elmer then settles into his hammock and quickly falls fast asleep, muttering to himself.\n\nBugs places a pair of glasses on Elmer's face, paints the lenses black and sets the alarm clock to go off at noon. When it wakes Elmer, he thinks it is nighttime because everything seems dark. He goes to his tent, takes off his day clothes to reveal night clothes underneath, and goes to bed. Bugs then removes the glasses from Elmer and crows like a rooster, awakening Elmer who believes it is the next morning.\n\nElmer washes his face but cannot reach his towel because it is hanging on a branch that Bugs keeps at a steady, short distance from him. Elmer blindly follows the towel (\"I do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture\", Bugs confides to the audience). He causes Elmer to step off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the Grand Canyon, but suddenly realizes he is in midair. He runs back to safety and holds on to Bugs for dear life. Bugs then admits he is the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a black bear. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.\n\nThe bear soon gives up (after sniffing Elmer's \"B.O.\" – his feet), but Bugs climbs onto Elmer and starts growling exactly like the bear. He misbehaves in various ways to keep Elmer on the ground with his eyes shut, but just as he starts biting Elmer's foot, Elmer sees what is going on and grabs his shotgun. The bear returns and Bugs runs away just as Elmer swings the gun, clobbering the bear rather than the rabbit. A chase ensues with Elmer and the bear running through the trees to the tune of the \"William Tell Overture.\" Finally, the bear freaks Elmer out by riding on top of him.\n\nWhen the bear is knocked off him after hitting a tree branch, Elmer gives up and packs everything into his car (almost including a huge tree). He passes the welcome sign at the gate on his way out, backs up and reads it again. He declares its promise of \"a restful retreat\" to be \"bawogney!\" and, to teach the park not to give false advertisement, he chops the sign to bits with an ax and stomps on the pieces while calling the park's \"peace and wewaxation\" promises \"wubbish!\" A ranger (along with Bugs) appears, and has an angry expression on his face. Elmer is arrested for the destruction of government property, and from his jail cell window he tells us that \"anyway\" he is \"wid of that gwizzwy bear and scwewy wabbit! West and wewaxation at wast!\" Unfortunately, he turns to find out that somehow he is sharing his cell with both Bugs \"and\" the black bear. They both ask how long he has in jail (\"Pardon me but, how long ya in for, doc?\" they ask).\n\nFor the cartoon, Elmer was redesigned as a fat man (based on voice actor Arthur Q. Bryan's own physique) in an attempt to make him funnier. The \"fat Elmer\" would only make three more appearances in the \"Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies\" canon – \"The Wabbit Who Came to Supper\", \"The Wacky Wabbit\" and \"Fresh Hare\", in addition to a cameo appearance in the non-canon war bond advertisement \"Any Bonds Today?\" – before returning to the slimmer form by which he is better known, for \"The Hare-Brained Hypnotist\". This cartoon was the only time, though, that the Fat Elmer also had a red nose. This is the only cartoon with the \"fat\" version of Elmer to remain under copyright; the other \"fat Elmer\" cartoons are in the public domain.\n\nBugs would show up in a prison two more times: in \"Rebel Rabbit\" (1949) and \"Big House Bunny\" (1950). At the ends of \"Rabbit Transit\" (1947) and \"Hare Brush\" (1955) he is arrested, but not actually shown in prison therein, Bugs would also be arrested at the end of \"Fresh Hare\" (1942), but it is shown he decided to give himself up and also given a death penalty instead.\n\nThe lobby card where Bugs paints Elmer's glasses black is also done in the film.\n\n\nIn December 2018, a still from the short depicting Bugs mocking Elmer by imitating his weight became an Internet meme. The meme originated from fictitious cover art for a video game titled \"Big Chungus\" (with \"chungus\" being a neologism associated with video game commentator Jim Sterling) which featured the still and was popularized by a Facebook post by a GameStop manager, who alleged that a colleague's mother had inquired about purchasing the fictional game as a gift for her son.\n\n"}

Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making ketones, which are used for energy during fasting.\n\nThis disorder usually appears within the first year of life. The signs and symptoms of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency include vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, convulsions, and coma. When episodes occur in an infant or child, blood sugar becomes extremely low (hypoglycemia), and harmful compounds can build up and cause the blood to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). These episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or sometimes other types of stress.\n\nMutations in the \"HMGCL\" gene cause 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. The enzyme made by the \"HMGCL\" gene plays an essential role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. This enzyme also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats. If a mutation in the \"HMGCL\" gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to process leucine or make ketones properly. A lack of ketones leads to hypoglycemia, and compounds called organic acids (which are formed as products of amino acid and fat breakdown) can cause the blood to become too acidic. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia impair tissue function, especially in the central nervous system.\nThis condition is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.\nLess than 20 patients with MGA type I have been reported in the literature (Mol Genet Metab. 2011 Nov;104(3):410-3.

This enabled the aristocratic family to recover financially through the hefty bride price usually asked from the commoner. On the other hand, the commoner was allowed to add the aristocratic name of his bride (with the nobiliary particle \"\"de\"\") to his own family name, and this was dearly sought.\n\nThis social practice was frowned upon by aristocratic families less in need, who looked with contempt or pity at the aristocratic families that had to re-gild their coat of arms. They called such an alliance with a commoner a \"mésalliance\" (\"misalliance, marriage beneath one's station\"), and the practice was often called \"déchoir\" (\"to fall from rank\") or \"salir son blason\" (\"to dirty one's coat of arms\"). As in most of Europe, noble children who married commoners would lose their noble status and take on that of their spouses. In the worst-case scenario, if the poor aristocratic family died out with no other heir than the daughter married to the commoner, the family was said to \"fall into commonalty\" (\"tomber en roture\").\n\nAs the French economy underwent drastic changes after the Middle Ages, many aristocratic families lost their position of power and wealth, and ended up in poverty. For those aristocratic families from the provinces and far from Paris, far away from power and its associated gratifications, \"redorer son blason\" was often the only way to remain afloat. This was usually a step taken in the last extremity, often seen as shameful and degrading. However, in a few cases, \"redorer son blason\" could also be prestigious, such as was the case for the aristocratic families who married daughters with members of the Colbert family.\n\nToday in France, the phrase is still used, but in a different context, meaning \"to regain prestige\" or \"to improve one's image\". An example of this contemporary usage in French newspapers is the \"Le Point\" headline: \"Les maires FN veulent redorer leur blason\".\n\n"}

They were brought from Africa to Brazil in a slave ship and during this journey his authority amongst his compatriots was noticed by the Portuguese slave traders who nicknamed him \"Chico Rei\". In Brazil he was set to work in the gold mines of Minas Gerais. By hiding flakes of gold about his body and in his hair, he amassed sufficient funds to allow him, after 5 years or so, to buy his son's freedom and later his own. He was also able to acquire the Encardideira gold mine in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto). Profits from the mine were used to help other slaves to buy their freedom and to build the church of Santa Efigênia, also in Vila Rica. The Encardideira mine has been disused since 1888 when slavery was abolished in Brazil and it is now open to the public.\n\nThe legend of Chico Rei has become part of the Brazilian folklore and his admirable tale of fight for freedom has captured the imagination of many Brazilian storytellers. His story is often told in Brazilian folklore tales books, and it has been told both in theater and cinema as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972038", "title": "Pectoral cross", "text": "Pectoral cross\n\nA pectoral cross or pectorale (from the Latin \"pectoralis\", \"of the chest\") is a cross that is worn on the chest, usually suspended from the neck by a cord or chain. In ancient and medieval times pectoral crosses were worn by both clergy and laity, but by the end of the Middle Ages the pectoral cross came to be a special indicator of position worn by bishops. In the Catholic Church, the wearing of a pectoral cross remains restricted to popes, cardinals, bishops and abbots. The modern pectoral cross is relatively large, and is different from the small crosses worn on necklaces by many Christians. Most pectoral crosses are made of precious metals (platinum, gold or silver) and some contain precious or semi-precious gems. Some contain a corpus like a crucifix while others use stylized designs and religious symbols.\n\nIn many Christian denominations, the pectoral cross symbolizes that the person wearing it is a member of the clergy, or that the wearer is a member of the higher or senior clergy. However, in many Western churches there are an increasing number of laypeople who choose to wear some form of a cross around their neck.\n\nWhile many Christians, both clergy and laity, wear crosses, the pectoral cross is distinguished by both its size (up to six inches across) and that it is worn in the center of the chest below the heart (as opposed to just below the collarbones).\n\nThroughout the centuries, many pectoral crosses have been made in the form of reliquaries which contain alleged fragments of the True Cross or relics of saints. Some such reliquary pectorals are hinged so that they open to reveal the relic, or the relic may be visible from the front through glass.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of a pectoral cross is its mention by Pope Hilarius in 461. In 811 Nicephorus sent Pope Leo III a golden pectoral cross. At this time, pectoral crosses were worn by both clergy and laity.\n\nThe widespread official use of a pectoral cross, however, did not begin in the Western church until around the 14th century. The use of the pectoral cross in the Roman Rite was first required in the Roman Pontifical of Pius V.\n\nThe first Anglican bishop to wear a pectoral cross was Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln (1885–1910).\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, a pectoral cross is one of the pontificals used by the pope, cardinals, archbishops and bishops. Various popes have extended this privilege to abbots, abbesses and some cathedral canons. For Cardinals the use is regulated by Motu Proprio \"Crux Pectoralis\" of Pius X.\n\nA pectoral cross is worn with both clerical suits or religious habits, and when attending both liturgical or civil functions. With a clerical suit, the pectoral cross is worn either hung around the neck so it remains visible or is placed in the left shirt or coat pocket so the chain is still visible but the cross is not (this is not actually an official requirement, but is done for practical purposes).\nIf a cassock is worn, the pectoral cross is either suspended from the prelate's neck and hangs free or is fastened to a front button with a special hook that is attached to the cross. The presence of a pectoral cross is useful to distinguish a bishop from a monsignor, since they wear similar cassocks.\n\nIn choir dress—that is, when he wears a cassock, rochet and mozzetta—the pectoral cross is usually suspended by a cord of silk. This cord is green and gold for an archbishop or a bishop, and red and gold for a cardinal and gold for the pope. An abbot makes use of a black and gold silk cord while an abbess and canon would use a black silk cord. Formerly, protonotaries apostolic wore a pectoral cross on a purple silk cord when celebrating in pontificals.\n\nWhen celebrating Mass, bishops wear the pectoral cross suspended by the cord over the alb but under the chasuble, where it is not visible. However, some bishops wear their pectoral cross over their chasuble, suspended by a chain.\n\nIf clerics who do not possess episcopal character wish to wear a pectoral cross, it is presumed that they are free to wear it under their clothes, so as not to confuse them with bishops. Again in practice some clergy who are not prelates do wear a pectoral cross.\n\nIt is worn over the alb during liturgical functions. The prelate should kiss the cross before putting it on his neck, and while putting it on say the prayer \"Munire me digneris\" (the origin of which dates back to the Middle Ages), in which he petitions God for protection against his enemies, and begs to bear in mind continually the Passion of Jesus, and the triumphs of the confessors of the Faith.\n\nThe pontifical pectoral cross is distinct from the simple cross, the use of which is often permitted by the pope to members of cathedral chapters. Canons, to whom this privilege has been granted, are permitted to wear the cross at choir service only, and not over the alb at liturgical services, unless specially permitted.\n\nThe pectoral is the latest addition to episcopal ornaments. The custom, however, of wearing a cross on the breast either with or without holy relics, dates back to ancient time and was observed not only by bishops, but also by priests and lay people. The first mention made of the pectoral cross as a part of pontifical ornament is made by Innocent III, and its use as such only became customary toward the close of the Middle Ages. As an adornment for bishops we meet it the first time toward the end of the thirteenth century (Durandus), but at that time it was not generally worn by bishops. As Durandus says: \"it was left to the discretion of the individual bishop to wear it or not\".\n\nThe widespread use of pectoral crosses has been revived in the Anglican Communion, and is usually limited to bishops. The pectorals worn by Anglican bishops do not normally have the corpus (body of Jesus) depicted on them. They may be decorated with amethyst or a bishop's mitre, and are usually suspended from a simple gold chain. Anglo-Catholic bishops may follow more of the Roman Catholic model.\n\nOther Anglican clergy occasionally wear crosses around their necks, but their appearance and form are generally more modest so as not to confuse them with bishops (who also generally wear purple, palatinate, or amaranth magenta shirts). \n\nAt their meeting in The Vatican on 21 November 2009 to resolve tensions over an offer for disaffected Anglicans to convert to Rome, the Pope gave the Archbishop of Canterbury a pectoral Cross. This was interpreted by some observers as an indication that the Pope recognized the Archbishop of Canterbury as a Bishop, in spite of Apostolicae curae a papal bull from 1897 under which the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the validity of Anglican ordination.\n\nIn recent years, Protestant churches have returned to more traditional ceremonial dress from either the Catholic, Orthodox or Anglican tradition. Pectoral crosses are worn by clergy in many denominations, mainly Lutheranism, by a bishop, or by a pastor or occasionally by choristers or liturgical assistants in other denominations. Generally speaking, only prelates will wear a gold cross suspended with a chain when wearing ceremonial garments or when wearing a suit, in one's left pocket over the heart. Clergy who are not bishops usually wear a silver cross suspended by a cord (usually black). In some denominations the colour of the cord refers to a specific position held in that denomination.\n\nIn the Church of Sweden, pectoral crosses were reintroduced for bishops in 1805 by king Gustav IV Adolf. The model of 1805 is still in use today. Bishops wear a simple latin cross of gold suspended by a gold chain. The archbishop of Uppsala uses the same model with the addition of golden rays in the angles of the cross.\n\nIn Orthodox practice, the pectoral cross is worn by all bishops, but not necessarily by all priests. In the Greek tradition, the pectoral cross is only given to specific priests for faithful service; in the Russian tradition, the silver cross is worn by all priests. Whenever the cross is put on, the wearer first uses it to make the Sign of the Cross on himself and then kisses it and puts it on.\n\nThe priest's cross depicts the crucified Christ, whether in painted form as an icon, or in relief. However, the Orthodox crucifix differs from the Western type by the fact that the \"soma\" (body of Christ) is not in full three-dimensional form, but in no more than three-quarter relief. It also bears the inscription INBI (the titulus that Pontius Pilate placed above the head of Jesus at the crucifixion) and the letters IC XC NIKA around the four arms of the cross. Orthodox pectoral crosses are almost always on chains of either silver or gold, sometimes with intricately worked links. Priest's crosses will often have an icon of Christ \"Made Without Hands\" at the top. This is the icon before which Orthodox Christians usually confess their sins. In Russian practice, the back of a priest's cross is usually inscribed with St. Paul's words to St. Timothy: \"Be an example to the believers in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity\" (1 Tim. 4:12).\n\nOrthodox pectoral crosses are awarded in several degrees (particularly in the Russian tradition):\n\n\nWhen vesting before celebrating the Divine Liturgy, the pectoral cross is presented to the bishop who will bless the pectoral, cross himself with it, kiss the cross and put it on. Meanwhile, the Protodeacon, swinging the censer says the following prayer:\n\nHe who would be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me (, etc.); always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.\n\nA priest may be granted the right to wear a second pectoral cross.\n\nA priest who has been given the pectoral cross will typically wear it at all times, whether vested or not.\n\nIn Russian practice, a nun who is not an abbess may also be granted the privilege of wearing a pectoral cross, as an honorary award (however, this award is not granted to monks who are not priests).\n\nThe pectoral cross worn by Coptic bishops and abbots is sometimes made from intricately worked leather, though metal pectorals are also used.\n"}

She was originally SS \"Prinzess Irene\", a built in 1899 by AG Vulcan Stettin of Stettin, Germany, for the North German Lloyd line.\n\nAt the beginning of World War I the ship was in New York and was interned by the United States. She was seized when that country entered the conflict in 1917 and converted to a troop transport. As USS \"Pocohantas\", she carried 24,573 servicemen to Europe, and after the war returned 23,296 servicemen to the United States.\nDecommissioned by the U.S. Navy, the United States Shipping Board sold her back to the North German Lloyd line, where she saw mercantile service until being scrapped in 1932.\n\nShe was launched as \"Prinzess Irene\" on 19 June 1900 by Aktiengesellschaft Vulkan, Stettin, Germany for North German Lloyd Lines. On 9 September 1900, she started her maiden voyage to New York City. On 30 October 1900, she began the first of seven trips on the German Empire mail run to the Far East to Yokohama, the route she was built for.\n\nOn 30 April 1903, she went on the Genoa – Naples – New York run and stayed mainly on this service together with her sister ship and sometimes other ships of the \"Barbarossa\" class. In 1911 under, Captain Frederic von Letten-Peterssen, she was stranded for eighty-three hours on the Fire Island sandbars.\n\nHer last voyage was to New York on 9 July 1914. With the outbreak of World War I in August, she was stranded in New York since the British Royal Navy controlled the North Atlantic. She remained there until seized by the United States by on 30 June 1917, under the authority prescribed in the Enemy Vessel Confiscation Joint Resolution passed on 12 May 1917.\n\nAfter refitting and training with the Atlantic Fleet, she was commissioned as \"Princess Irene\" on 25 July 1917, Commander Junius F. Hellweg in command. Assigned to the Cruiser-Transport Force under Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the ship was renamed \"Pocahontas\" on 1 September 1917.\n\nThrough the rest of the war and for nearly a year after the Armistice, \"Pocahontas\" served as a troop transport, completing eighteen round trips to Europe. She carried 24,573 servicemen to Brest and St. Nazaire and returned 23,296 servicemen to the United States.\n\nAlthough \"Pocahontas\" conveyed all of her passengers safely, she faced numerous dangers. The most serious incident occurred in the forenoon of 2 May 1918 when an Imperial German Navy submarine surfaced in her path and straddled her with shells. Captain Edward C. Kalbfus ordered the crew to battle stations and gave the signal to open fire. However, the U-boat was not in range of her guns. Fragments of enemy shells landed on the ship, but she was not directly hit and suffered no casualties. Captain Kalbus commenced zig-zag courses, and then at full speed drew away from the submarine, probably , about twenty minutes after the attack began. Making a record of , he kept the enemy out of range until he lost her. For his successful defense of his ship, Captain Kalfbus was awarded the Navy Cross.\n\n\"Pocahontas\" decommissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 7 November 1919 and was handed over to the United States Shipping Board for sale.\n\nIn 1920, SS \"Pocahontas\" was chartered to the United States Mail Steamship Company of New York and began commercial services between the United States and Italy in 1921.\n\n\"Pocahontas\" was the subject of widespread media coverage between May and July 1921 due to mechanical problems, sabotage and mutiny. The vessel left New York on 23 May 1921 en route to Naples. On 25 May, she was anchored off Nobska Point in Vineyard Sound in need of repair. A gang of boilermakers and mechanics boarded the ship to make repairs en route to Boston. Further repairs were undertaken in the Azores in June. The vessel did not arrive in Naples until 4 July, spending 43 days at sea. It was later reported that the vessel had been subject to sabotage and that some of the crew \"began to threaten the commander and to damage the machinery and the electric light apparatus and even attempt ... to sink the steamer\" Just before entering Naples, the assistant engineer drowned when he jumped overboard. On arrival in Naples, the ship's captain submitted a full report to the American consul, who conducted an investigation. The crew, in turn, filed charges of cruelty against the captain with the Italian authorities. While the crew were returned to the United States, the ship was repaired in Naples. A \"great deal\" of cotton waste was found in the steamer's pumps, but otherwise it suffered only minor damage. Although she was due to sail for New York on 31 July, the ship was ordered to stay in port pending payment of debts incurred in relation to the repair work. The total repair bill amounted to 2,700,000 lire. Despite intervention from the American consul, the ship did not sail until 8 September. Due to frequent bunker fires, however, the ship was considered to be in worse condition \"than when it was in drydock\". The vessel was again laid up on 22 September, this time in Gibraltar, having suffered further damage to her machinery. Passengers were transferred to other vessels. The ship then remained inactive until she was sold in 1922.\n\nThe then future Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, was on board \"Pocahontas\" in May 1921, while emigrating from the United States to Palestine. She recounts the events of the journey in her autobiography, \"My Life\".\n\nIn April 1922, the United States Shipping Board received an offer of £17,000 for the purchase of \"Pocahontas\", which was then laid up in Malta. When the United States Mail Steamship Company went into liquidation in 1922, the ship was sold back to its original owners, North German Lloyd and renamed \"Bremen\".\n\nAfter repair and refit, SS \"Bremen\" made her first voyage from Bremen to New York in April 1923. She was renamed \"Karlsruhe\" in 1928 and continued to serve until 1932, before being scrapped in Germany.\n\n"}

He is mainly known for his contribution to Christian music and liturgy in the Dutch language, used in both Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, although a few songs have been censored in some dioceses. He is the author of over 60 books and at the time of over 700 hymns, songs, Psalms (often in an own interpretation), and prayers.\n\nOosterhuis was born on 1 November 1933 in Amsterdam. He was a Jesuit and is a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nIn 1954, inspired by Che Guevara who said that churches have the potential to transform the social structure of society, Oosterhuis combined his priesthood with political activism.\n\nIn 1965, Oosterhuis became one of the major supporters of ecumenism, following the modernist interpretation of the Second Vatican Council. He started out to rewrite the liturgy and make it acceptable to all. Some of his changes were considered controversial within the Roman Catholic Church especially writing the prayer for agnostics: \"Heer, als U bestaat, kom dan onder ons\" (\"Lord, if You exist, come amongst us\").\n\nHis political views, conflicts regarding the liturgy and unorthodox views regarding priestly celibacy led to Oosterhuis being dismissed from the Jesuit order in 1969. He left the Catholic Church and functioned as an Independent Catholic priest, in charge of a church in Amsterdam, for about forty years. He is still focussed on writing liturgy, poetry and essays.\n\nBack in the sixties and seventies his liturgical texts were put to music by his fellow former Jesuit (1922–2003). The co-operation between Oosterhuis and Huijbers ended. The last engaged himself more and more in a \"spirituality-without-God\" or \"- without-Thou\", whereas the former kept to his biblical prayers, hymns, psalms. After they both split up and Huijbers moved to the South of France, Oosterhuis' main composers were two of Huijbers' pupils, (born 1945) and Tom Löwenthal (born 1954).\n\nOosterhuis founded the discussion center \"\" (\"The Red Hat\") in Amsterdam in 1989. The building was a former Remonstrant shelter church, hidden because Remonstrantism was outlawed in the 17th century. The building was more or less deserted at the time. Oosterhuis wanted to use it for his student organization (1990) and create a discussion center. Its nice interior made it also very suitable for TV-shows. After a short period Oosterhuis was replaced by a managing-director for a more commercial exploitation of this prominent building in Amsterdam's Canal zone.\n\nIn 2002 Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands asked him to deliver the eulogy at the funeral of her Prince-Consort Claus von Amsberg, a longtime personal friend, in the New Church in Delft. That same week the Protestant VU University in Amsterdam granted Oosterhuis an honorary doctorate in theology.\n\nIt was at De Rode Hoed where André van der Louw announced his \"Social Democratic Renewal Program\" which was an incentive to reform the Labour Party. Oosterhuis ultimately choose the lesser known Socialist Party as he viewed it closer to socialist ideals. He also opined that \"The Socialist Party is closer to the social ethics of the Bible than many Christian parties.\"\n\nIn 2006 elections Oosterhuis stood as final candidate, a symbolic position, for the Socialist Party.\n\nOosterhuis translated the Torah together with , which was released in five separate books, as an attempt to translate the first five books of the Bible as close to contemporary Dutch as possible without losing the style figures of the original Hebrew text.\n\nHuub Oosterhuis is the father of the musicians Trijntje Oosterhuis and Tjeerd Oosterhuis.\n\nVery few books, poems, verses of Huub Oosterhuis were translated into English: e.g. \"Fifty Psalms\", \"Your Word is Near\", \"At Times I See\", \"The Children of the Poor Man\", \"Wake Your Power\" (CD). Some of his songs were translated to German. Lothar Zenetti translated his \"Ik sta voor U\" to \"Ich steh vor dir mit leeren Händen, Herr\" (I stand before You with empty hands), which was included in German Protestant and Catholic hymnals.\n"}

Variables \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" are drawn from normal distributions with means 10, 10, and 30, respectively, and standard deviations 1, 1, and 3 respectively, i.e.,\n\nEven though \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" are statistically independent and therefore uncorrelated, in the depicted typical sample the ratios \"x\"/\"z\" and \"y\"/\"z\" have a correlation of 0.53. This is because of the common divisor (\"z\") and can be better understood if we colour the points in the scatter plot by the \"z\"-value. Trios of (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") with relatively large \"z\" values tend to appear in the bottom left of the plot; trios with relatively small \"z\" values tend to appear in the top right.\n\nPearson derived an approximation of the correlation that would be observed between two indices (formula_2 and formula_3), i.e., ratios of the absolute measurements formula_4:\n\nwhere formula_6 is the coefficient of variation of formula_7, and formula_8 the Pearson correlation between formula_7 and formula_10.\n\nThis expression can be simplified for situations where there is a common divisor by setting formula_11, and formula_12 are uncorrelated, giving the spurious correlation:\n\nFor the special case in which all coefficients of variation are equal (as is the case in the illustrations at right), formula_14\n\nPearson was joined by Sir Francis Galton and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon in cautioning scientists to be wary of spurious correlation, especially in biology where it is common to scale or normalize measurements by dividing them by a particular variable or total. The danger he saw was that conclusions would be drawn from correlations that are artifacts of the analysis method, rather than actual “organic” relationships.\n\nHowever, it would appear that spurious correlation (and its potential to mislead) is not yet widely understood. In 1986 John Aitchison, who pioneered the log-ratio approach to compositional data analysis wrote:\n\nMore recent publications suggest that this lack of awareness prevails, at least in molecular bioscience.\n"}

In 1799, Westtown was around one day's carriage ride from Philadelphia.\n\nWesttown is a Quaker school affiliated with the Friends General Conference branch of the Religious Society of Friends. All students are required to attend Meeting for Worship together with adults in the community who voluntarily attend (boarding students are required to attend Westtown Monthly Meeting on Sundays as well). Westtown uses the traditional Quaker practice of coming to unity in making some high-level decisions.\n\nWesttown has been a coeducational school since its founding in 1799. Students come from many states and foreign countries.\n\nThe 2018 documentary, \"We Town\", is about the 2016-2017 Upper School Basketball Team, featuring Mo Bamba. It chronicles the quest of the team to win the State Championship.\n\nCurrently, students at Westtown come from 20 states and 20 countries.\n\nWesttown School first opened on May 6, 1799. It was founded by Philadelphia Quakers who raised the money to build a boarding school and purchased land a full day's carriage ride from Philadelphia—where they could provide a “guarded education in a healthy environment\" away from the secular influences of the city. For many years, Westtown was nearly self-sufficient, with the campus providing raw materials used in the construction of its buildings and food for the people who lived and worked at the school.\n\nBoys and girls had separate classes until about 1870. Boys learned useful skills such as woodshop, surveying, and bookkeeping, and girls had classes like sewing. However, Westtown eventually recognized that students of both genders should know basic academic subjects such as reading, penmanship, grammar, mathematics, geography, and science.\n\nThe 1880s brought physical changes to Westtown. The main building was replaced with a structure designed by architect Addison Hutton, which was completed in 1888 and is still in use today. During the 20th century, the student body and the curriculum both became more diverse. Visual and performing arts were added, for example, and non-Quakers, African-American, and international students were eventually admitted.\n\nWesttown's Esther Duke Archives is a facility dedicated to collecting and maintaining materials relating to the people and history of the school. Students and historians alike use the Archives for historical research.\n\nWesttown is located on a campus in southern Pennsylvania. The campus is 600 acres, including a 14.5-acre lake, arboretum, frog pond, 14 playing fields, stadium tennis courts, organic farm, Lower School mini-farm, medicine wheel garden, wooded cross country course, and 21-element ropes course.\n\n\nhttps://www.westtown.edu/\n\n"}

Since its founding in 1937, Vendo has come out with many innovations that now exist in nearly every beverage and snack vending machine in use today. In 2005, Vendo moved its headquarters to Dallas, Texas, and was renamed SandenVendo America, Inc., signifying a new global synergy with parent and sister companies in Japan, North America, and Europe.\n\n\"Vendo\" was founded in 1937 in Kansas City, Missouri, by brothers Elmer F. and John T Pierson. With help from J.E. Hagstrom and purchased patent for a lid that could be attached to coolers, the brothers developed an innovative vending lid that was much more practical than any other one available at the time. Nicknamed \"Red Top\", this vending lid moved the opening to the bottle rather than the bottle to the opening and was the first of many innovations introduced by the Vendo company.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, some of the company's work force was dedicated to producing radar detection systems as well as various other electronic equipment for the military. As well as manufacturing military equipment, \"Vendo\" was authorized to produce and send 5,000 beverage vending units for military training camps and war plants to help raise morale. For its efforts, company earned seven Army-Navy ‘E’ Awards awards for \"excellence in fulfilling government military contracts\".\nAfter the war, the Vendo company began expanding globally. By 1956, vending machines were being shipped internationally to 20 different countries. At the same time, Vendo began experimenting with new ideas. Vending machines that dispensed varieties of goods were manufactured and distributed and existing beverage vending machines were given a new, sleeker look. It was this time that the company began creating completely automated convenience stores and restaurants as well as drive-in refreshment stations. In 1956, Vendo merged with its primary rival, Vendorlator. It became a major supplier for the entire soft-drink industry and, for a brief period, the company went public. The company's expansion continued into the 1970s as the company expanded its international market and began manufacturing the world's first canned beverage dispensing machine.\n\nThe oil crisis of the 1970s struck a major blow to Vendo Co. Facing major financial losses, the company sold off all of its assets, keeping only its beverage machine distribution division. The site in Kansas City was abandoned and the company kept only the plants in Fresno, California and Corinth, Mississippi.\n\nThe company was revitalized in the 1980s when it was acquired by Sanden Corporation, a manufacturer of high-tech electronics. The company received both technological and financial support from its new parent company and once again began introducing innovations to the automated goods distribution market. By the end of the 1990s, Vendo had received patents on many new features for vending machines, such as increased capacity, accommodation for goods of many different shapes and sizes, and the ability to accept debit cards as a form of payment. The company began to expand again into the 2000s, moving its headquarters to Dallas, Texas and taking on the name \"Sanden Vendo\" to show its thanks and loyalty to the Sanden Corporation.\n\nAlong with Dixie-Narco, a rival company, Vendo is one of the main providers of vending machines for PepsiCo, particularly in the western United States. Vendo is also a major provider of vending machines for the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and a secondary provider for The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nAlthough \"Vendo\" makes most of its profit from selling vending machines and vending machine parts, the company also sells display stands for both refrigerated and hot food as well as innovative vending machine parts, such as versatile delivery systems and payment systems that will accept credit cards or dispense bills.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972144", "title": "Battle of Refugio", "text": "Battle of Refugio\n\nThe Battle of Refugio was fought from March 12–15, 1836, near Refugio, Texas. Mexican General José Urrea and 1,500 Centralista soldiers fought against Amon B. King and his 28 American volunteers and Lieutenant Colonel William Ward and his approximately 120 Americans. The battle, a part of the Goliad Campaign of the Texas Revolution, resulted in a Mexican victory and splintered Texan resistance.\n\nUnder President Antonio López de Santa Anna, the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model to a more centralized government. His increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited federalists throughout the nation to revolt. The Mexican army quickly put down revolts in the Mexican interior, including a brutal suppression of militias in Oaxaca and Zacatecas. Unrest continued in the Mexican state Coahuila y Tejas. The area that bordered the United States, known as Texas, was populated primarily by English-speaking settlers, known as Texians. In October, the Texians took up arms in what became known as the Texas Revolution. The following month, Texians declared themselves part of a state independent from Coahuila and created a provisional state government based on the principles of the Constitution of 1824. By the end of the year, all Mexican troops had been expelled from Texas.\n\nDetermined to quash the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force to restore order; by the end of 1835 his army numbered 6,019 soldiers. In late December, at his behest, the Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops \"will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag\". In the early nineteenth century, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians. Santa Anna personally led the bulk of his troops inland to San Antonio de Béxar and ordered General José de Urrea to lead 550 troops [additional units would follow] along the Atascocita Road toward Goliad. Urrea's mission objectives were twofold, first, protect the Mexican Army's southern flank. Secondly, clear the Texas Gulf Coast and occupy the various ports. This operation would intercept and stop the ongoing flow of men and supplies, isolating the Texas rebellion. Although Urrea eventually achieved his objectives, delays and high casualties prevented the General and his men from giving General Santa Anna's main force important support. This operation and successful suppression of the rebellion along the Texas Gulf Coast have become known as the Goliad Campaign.\n\nColonel James Fannin and his men had improved the fortifications at the old Presidio La Bahía and renamed it \"Fort Defiance.\" News of the fate of Texians under Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio and James Grant at the Battle of Agua Dulce (both captured in earlier fights) created confusion rather than stirring the volunteers gathered at Goliad into action.\n\nOn March 7, Lewis Ayers brought Fannin news from Refugio, a town south of Goliad. The week before, the \"Victoriana Guardes\", a group of \"Tejano\" (native Mexican residents) who supported centralism, had ransacked the town. After destroying much property, the \"Guardes\", a militia under the command of Captain Carlos de la Garza, made camp just outside the town. Several pro-independence Anglo families, including Ayers' wife and children, remained in Refugio area, afraid that if they stayed they would be captured by the Mexican army, but that if they left they would be harmed by de la Garza's men.\n\nFannin agreed to send troops to evacuate the settlers as soon as oxen and carts were available to assist with the transport. Three days later, the army's carts returned from Port Lavaca with supplies for the garrison. As soon as they were unloaded, Fannin called for volunteers to go to Refugio. On March 11, Captain Amon B. King led 28 men of his company and most of the carts to evacuate the settlers. They arrived that evening and camped for the night at Mission Nuestra Senora del Refugio, where some of the Anglo families had taken refuge. The Mexican Catholic Church had abandoned the mission some years earlier. The mission was a semi ruin. No priests or other church officials were stationed at the old mission. Irish immigrant settlers from the Refugio area had recently repaired the main building's roof, doors and widows. They repaired pews and other interior furnishings and furniture. Although these repairs were crude and very basic, it made it possible to hold services when a priest could be found.\n\nThe following morning, King led his troops to the ranch of Esteban Lopez, where the family of Lewis Ayers was staying. King arrested six \"Tejanos\" he had heard were ransacking abandoned homes. After he learned that other \"Tejanos\" were plundering homes about south, King took half of his men on an unauthorized mission to pursue them. They rode into an ambush staged by a group of de la Garza's men and Karankawa Indians. The Texians extricated themselves from the fight and returned to the Lopez ranch. All of the families gathered there were then escorted to the mission in Refugio.\n\nElements of Urrea's advance cavalry arrived in Refugio shortly after King and the families returned to the mission. Mexican troops and de la Garza's \"Guardes\" (approx. 100 total troops) surrounded the mission. King sent a messenger to Fannin, asking for reinforcements.\nEarlier that day, Fannin had received notice that Mexican troops had taken the Alamo, killing all of the defenders.\n\nFannin dispatched Lt. Colonel William Ward, a fellow Georgian, an organizer and former commander of the Georgia Battalion. This unit and a company commanded by Captain Peyton S. Wyatt, attached to the Georgia Battalion, would make up the balance of the relief column. The men departed in the early morning hours of the 13th of March. Fannin had decided to evacuate his position as soon as King and Ward returned. He ordered Ward to make all haste; avoid offensive contact with the Mexicans, to gather the civilians and return as soon as possible. To facilitate rapid movement, the Georgia Battalion carried only 36 rounds of ammunition per man as extended fighting was not expected. The column arrived in the early afternoon of the same day after a forced march over muddy roads. Ward found the mission under attack by some Mexican Cavalry and local Mexican militia. These forces retired after the Georgia Battalion fired one or two volleys.\n\nAlthough successful in breaking up the siege on the 13th, the arrival of Ward at Refugio led to conflict over command with Captain King who insisted, as first commander on scene, he should be in charge of the combined force, even though Lt. Colonel Ward was his regimental executive officer and outranked him. Ward insisted, after a short rest, the Georgia Battalion, King's Company should gather up the civilians and evacuate the Refugio Mission, returning to Goliad. King refused and stated he was taking his men to attack a ranch believed to be providing support for Captain Carlos de la Garza and the Mexican militias forces. The tense confrontation resulted in a stand off. King departed with his men and a few of the members of the Georgia Battalion (primarily from Wyatt's Company). The possibility of plunder and revenge was just too powerful for some. King and his men departed the mission in the early morning hours of the 14th. The failure of King to accept the orders directly from Fannin would have great ramifications for Fannin's entire command. 8.\n\nAfter King departed, more of Urrea's troops continued arriving and slowly, again, fully invested the mission. Sometime, late on the 13th or early morning hours of the 14th, a party of men under Captain Wyatt left the mission on patrol. They found a small group of Mexicans, probably militia, asleep and attacked, driving them away and killing 20-25 of the enemy. Early on the morning of the 14th, after King had departed, the Georgians heard firing in the distance. Thinking King may need assistance, Ward ordered two companies of the Georgia Battalion to form ranks and slowly move forward. The formation of 50-60 men halted after only 100 to 200 yards. To their front, the Georgians found a large formation of regular Mexican Army and were forced to return to the mission. Soon after, a water party from the mission came under fire but was successful bringing a large quantity of water back to the mission. As the Mexican Army maneuvered around the mission, Ward's men, under sporadic fire, attempted to further fortify the Refugio Mission complex. Ward assigned his 2nd company (Bullock's Company, (Captain U. J Bullock was absent. suffering from a case of measles, he had been left on the Texas coast and was never reunited with his company)), First Sergent Francis Marion Hunt of Macon Georgia commanding, to a low rock wall, part of an animal corral, to the east of the Mission building. This was necessary to cover the approach to the mission as the low wall blocked the view of the approaches to the mission. The rest of Georgia Battalion manned windows and dug some loopholes in the church's walls. For the most part, due to their ammunition shortage, the men did not return the Mexican fire.\n\nBefore King advanced far, he found a far stronger Mexican military presence in the area and was forced to halt and find concealment in a wooded area approximately 2 miles from the mission. Before long, Mexican local militia under the command of Carlos de la Garza discovered the small Texian force and firing broke out. Sometime later, King's command heard gun fire in the direction of the mission. The Mexican militia force, had been content to engage the Texian force at some distance and the fire had been ineffective. King and his force began to move in the direction of the mission using cover and partial concealment of the terrain trees. But again, the company was forced to halt as units of the regular Mexican Army joined the attack. King's force, behind trees and rocks, made an effective defense for a time, causing severe loses to the enemy finally running out of ammunition. Mexican accounts state a wounded King and his men surrendered to Garza's militia. They were turned over to regular Mexican forces and executed near the Refugio mission on the 15th or early on 16 March 1836. King's men were left where they fell.\n\nBack at Refugio Mission on the morning of the 14th. Mexican Army units continued to arrive adding their musket fire to attack on the mission. This fire was largely ineffective at first. The Mexican Army had few rifles, the troops were issued smooth bore muskets. Their gunpowder was not of first quality and the troops received almost no marksmanship training. The shooting continued for at least another hour as the Mexicans slowly maneuvered closer to the mission. Due to the shortage of ammunition, Ward ordered his command to hold their fire until the enemy came closer. Soon, a small cannon joined in but the thick stone walls of the mission could not be penetrated. When Mexican troops began to mass in the open 200 to 300 yards distant, the Georgians opened fire with their rifles with great effect and continued to take a toll as Urrea's troops advanced both on foot and mounted. The attack was well coordinated with multiple regimental and battalion sized units attacking different points of the mission's perimeter. In some places, Mexican formations reached the low stone perimeter wall that surrounded the Mission. But none reached the church or crossed the far wall defended by Bullock's Company. The Georgia Battalion turned back 3, possibly 4, major attacks. At least 2 were focused at the low stone wall to the east of the mission. Samuel Hardaway, a 15 year old native of Macon Georgia native, and L. T. Pease, also from Macon Georgia, were members of Bullock's Company and two of the few who survived battle and the war. Both published narratives concerning their service. Pease states in his narrative he and the rest of Bullock's Company were stationed on the low stone wall east of the mission. Both he and Samuel Hardaway describe heavy fighting with the ranks of the enemy coming very near to the wall before melting away from the Georgian's fire. The ground was littered with many of the dead and dying. Witnesses report only three members of the Georgia Battalion were wounded. One soldier's wound appeared mortal. Another was shot in the leg and could not walk. Lastly, Colonel Ward had been struck by falling masonry dislodged by cannon fire. Estimates of Mexican casualties vary from 150 to 600 wounded and killed. General José de Urrea, the commander of this wing of the Mexican Army, reports seemed to change over the years following the war. His first reporting claimed around 200 killed and wounded. Those present on the Texas side also vary. From a low of 150 to as high as 600 are reported. Unit rosters of Urrea's force before March 12 and after March 17 show a decline of over 300 fit for duty on the 17th. Mexican casualty reports do not include loses for Mexican militia units who fought this day. These units were in skirmishes and or full-scale battles from the 12th to the 20th of March. Sadly the loses of the very courageous men are unknown. Ward sent courier James Humphries and least one other to Fannin for orders as the fighting slowed on the evening of the 14th. Late on the 14th, Edward Perry, a Texas prisoner of the Mexican Army, was sent by General Urrea with a surrender demand. He told Ward both his couriers and one sent by Fannin had been intercepted by Urrea. He also forwarded a letter from Fannin, captured from Fannin's messenger. This letter ordered Ward to fall back to Victoria, where Texas forces were to regroup.\n\nDuring that long day of the 14th, Mexican units continued to arrive. By evening Urrea had concentrated a force estimated to number 1200 soldiers, infantry and cavalry, 100-200 Mexican Mounted Militia and several pieces of artillery were deployed. General Urrea made no secret of his numbers, hoping to force a surrender by intimidation. The Georgian had a front row seat to the pageantry of the bands and deploying units. In spite of the ever-increasing strength of his foe and aware the Georgia Battalion could expect no help, Ward sent Mr. Perry back to Urrea with his answer. \"The Georgians would not surrender.\"\n\nWith his supply of bullets and powder almost exhausted, Ward made plans to comply with Fannin's orders. That night or in the early morning hours of the 15th of March, in a driving rain storm, the Georgia Battalion, carrying their rifles, a very few rounds of ammunition and little else, quietly made their way through Mexican lines without notice of Mexican sentries. The wounded and at least one other healthy member of the unit, civilians and approximately 25 Mexican prisoners (unharmed) would remain behind. Ward and the bulk of his men escaped toward Copano, then turned at Melon Creek and headed for Victoria.\n\nAt Refugio Mission, Mexican forces were not aware of their foes escape until daylight when the former Mexican prisoners left the mission. The wounded and Anglo civilians braced for the arrival of the Mexican Army. While those remaining in the mission were searched and systematically robbed of any valuables, Mexican officers soon arrived on scene and restored order. The wounded were protected (for a time) from ill treatments by common soldiers and women and children were made safe. Later, some of the common soldiers returned and executed the wounded. It is not known if they were acting under orders. Some historians believe the good treatment of the former Mexican prisoners helped to assuage, at least in part, the Mexican Army's desire for retribution. Juan José Holzinger, a German-Mexican officer, saw fit to save Lewis T. Ayers, Francis Dieterich, Benjamin Odlum and eight men from local families. The families who feared injury or death by Mexican forces were allowed to return to their homes unharmed. Events proved the rescue attempts by King's company and the Georgia Battalion unnecessary.\n\nTo avoid Mexican cavalry, Ward and his men were forced to travel in among the trees and heavy undergrowth along the creeks and many swamps. They waded in hip deep water for hours each day. Rain was frequent and the nights cold in these days of late March. Soldiers were forced to rest and sleep in trees. The command continued for days eating frogs, snakes whatever they could find. They did find and shoot a cow and rested for a time but were forced to return to the swamps upon the approach of Mexican forces. Although unfamiliar with the terrain, they struggled toward Victoria where it was thought Fannin should be. Survivors reported hearing gunfire in the direction of Coleto Creek two days before they neared Victoria. Men began to straggle and became lost or simply not wake up until the Battalion had moved on. Some of these men would prove to be the lucky ones but many of the lost were found be Mexican forces who rarely took prisoners. At Victoria, they found no time for rest; it was overrun with Urrea's troops. The group was forced to scatter after a short skirmish with Urrea's cavalry. Staying off the main roads, they moved toward Lavaca Bay, with ten of them eventually escaping. The remainder were surrounded and captured on March 22 by Urrea, two miles from Dimmit's Landing. Informed of Fannin's surrender, Ward and the men of the Georgia Battalion were promised surrender on the same terms given to Fannin's command at Coleto Creek. They were marched back to Victoria, where Holzinger again saved twenty-six men, by conscripting them as laborers for Urrea. Urrea had left Colonel Telesforo Alavez, in charge of Victoria. Señora Francita Alavez intervened with her husband as well, to make sure the captive laborers' lives would be saved. The remainder were sent to Goliad by March 25, joining a wounded Fannin and the rest of the Goliad garrison. Two days latter, the men were told they would march to the Texas coast and freedom, instead, they were marched a mile away from their former fortress and shot under direct orders of General Santa Anna.\n\nKing and, later Ward, failed their attempt to evacuate the Anglo civilians at Refugio. Their ultimate fate was virtually guaranteed by Kings willful disobedience of his superior officer's orders (and Fannin's clear instructions). Colonel Fannin's waiting for the return of a significant portion of his command also allowed General Urrea to overtake the rest of the Texas forces under his command on the road to Victoria at Coleto Creek. It is very possible General Urrea could still have caught and defeated a united and stronger force if King and Ward had escaped Refugio and reunited with Fannin. A larger force would probably further increase Mexican's losses but likely would not changed the ultimate outcome. Fannin had received orders from General Sam Houston while King and Ward were away that directed him to evacuate Goliad and retire to Victoria as soon as possible. A timely withdrawal and ultimately, reinforcement with substantial numbers of troops would allow Fannin to remain on the field as an effective fighting force. Reluctant to leave before the various detachments returned, Fannin failed to leave Goliad ahead of Urrea's advance, leading to the Battle of Coleto. Fannin, in his short period of command had demonstrated a slowness and lack of basic organizational skills necessary to move a large military force any distance. But the failure of these this Texan force to move was not entirely his fault. The revolutionary government had failed completely to provide the transport and basic supplies necessary to transform a static garrison trained and equipped only for defense in place. Even if not delayed, Fannin's attempt to join with Houston was not a certainty.\n\nThe sacrifice of the Texas volunteers at Refugio and Coleto Creek did result in severe damage to General Urrea's command and greatly delayed his advance, preventing his force from supporting the main army at San Jacinto. Additionally, Lt. Colonel Ward's successful breakout and withdrawal from the Refugio Mission during the night of 14–15 March 1836 and the 7 day retreat across rivers and through numerous swamps and bayous should be recognized as a notable military achievement. Ward, his officers and non commissioned officers were able to preserve unit integrity for the most part. Poorly equipped and clothed, lacking adequate food, the men of the Georgia Battalion continued to act in concert as a military unit and fighting force for the Texas cause. General Urrea was forced to deploy hundreds of his men to find and destroy the Georgians. Ward and the Georgia Battalion were able to fight off and successfully break contact with at least two Mexican Cavalry units and continue their march towards Victoria. Colonel Ward complied with Fannin's orders to reach Victoria. A feat Fannin, with a much larger force and a shorter distance to travel, could not do. When Ward found Victoria in the hands of the enemy, he continued on in an effort to reach a safe haven for his men and came within two miles of Dimmit's Landing before being overtaken and again surrounded by a force of regular Mexican Army troops. Surviving witnesses state the Georgia Battalion, using the very last of their ammunition, bayonets and their rifles as clubs fought off one last attack. General Urrea only then offered surrender terms, the same terms that vaguely offered a chance of parole and repatriation to the United States accepted by Fannin a few days earlier. Ward felt his men could again reach the timber and swamps and continue their march and told his officers he was against surrender. But the Georgia Battalion was a volunteer unit and he let his officers and men decide. Hungry, tired and suffering from exposure, the men voted to accept the Mexican General's terms. Through Ward's leadership, the Georgia Battalion continued as an effective fighting force for one very valuable week against an enemy force that was 12 times their number. Seven more days for Houston and his Army.\n\nIn the public square across the street from the county courthouse in Refugio, the King Monument stands as an honor to Captain King and his men. In the early 1900s, the square was owned by the State of Texas and was named King's State Park. In the 1850s the Texas Governor and Legislature agreed, in exchange for the sacrifice of the young Georgians and to repay Georgia for weapons and military supplies provided to Texas, and to Georgia's request a monument be erected to honor the Georgia Battalion, the state would pay for a monument to be erected in Texas. For a time, Texas plead poverty. Then a war and reconstruction and Texas again delayed the promised monument. Georgia still waits, but, to this day, Texas has not satisfied this debt of honor. There is no marker or state monument in Texas dedicated to the memory of those boys from Georgia and other members of the Georgia Battalion.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1856.\n\nBerks County's oldest institute of higher learning, Albright College traces its founding to 1856 when Union Seminary opened. Present-day Albright was formed by the mergers of several institutions.\n\nAlbright Collegiate Institute opened in 1895 and was renamed Albright College three years later. Union Seminary became Central Pennsylvania College and, in 1902, merged with Albright College. Schuylkill College, previously called Schuylkill Seminary, merged with Albright College in 1928. Albright's campus relocated from Myerstown, to Schuylkill College's campus, which is the present location of Albright, at the base of Mount Penn in Reading.\n\nThe College is named for Pennsylvania-German evangelical preacher Jacob Albright, who founded the Evangelical Association (later known as the Evangelical United Brethren Church). Born in 1759 in Douglass Township, (now Montgomery County) with the given name of Johannes Jacob Albrecht, the family changed their surname to \"Albright\" following Jacob's 1808 death.\n\nAlbright College offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, as well as a Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees in education. The college also offers accelerated degree programs with 10 locations throughout Pennsylvania.\n\nAlbright offers liberal arts and pre-professional programs. It created one of the first undergraduate psychobiology programs in the nation in the 1960s. The college's liberal arts curriculum has an interdisciplinary focus that allows students to create an individualized education. Fully half of Albright students have concentrations that combine two or three fields of learning.\n\nThree Albright programs that have received national attention in the past decade are fashion, theatre, and music. Albright was named one of the nation's top private fashion merchandising schools in 2015, 2016 and 2017 by Fashion-Schools.org. The theatre program has been honored by the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival consistently for the past 12 years. Albright's Domino Players have been invited to perform at Kennedy festival II 10 times in the last 15 years (2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019). “Waiting for Godot” (2007) was one of only four productions chosen to perform for the National KCACTF Conference. “Clybourne Park” (2016) and “A Raisin in the Sun” (2019) were named “Outstanding Production of a Play” – recognizing them as the best college production of their years. “A Raisin in the Sun” also received eight other national awards, for distinguished performance, scenic and lighting design, director and performances. The Music Industry Studies program at Albright College has been recognized as one of the top 35 music business programs in North America by Billboard magazine.\nThe Albright Creative Research Experience (ACRE) is a multi-disciplinary program that affords undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct research or pursue creative endeavors during the three-week January Interim or summer break. The students, who work one-on-one with faculty members, can be from any discipline, from STEM subjects to the humanities.\n\nAlbright College has been named one of the \"Best Northeastern\" schools for 14 consecutive years by The Princeton Review. Albright College has also been named one of the most ethnically and economically diverse schools in the country by \"U.S News and World Report\". In the \"Campus Ethnic Diversity\" category, as part of its 2018 Best Colleges rankings, \"U.S. News\" ranked Albright 33rd out of 208 national liberal arts colleges. In the “Economic Diversity” category, Albright ranked 27th out of 210 national liberal arts schools named. \"The Economist\" magazine listed Albright among the top 50 American colleges and universities for economic value in 2015.\n\nAlbright College athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III as a member of the Middle Atlantic Conferences.\n\nCharles \"Pop\" Kelchner founded the men's basketball team in 1900 and was athletic director at Albright College for 21 years. He was involved in aspects of Major League Baseball for over 50 years. Albright College dedicated the baseball field as Kelchner Field in 1952. Branch Rickey gave the dedication speech, with Connie Mack in attendance. Kelchner was a graduate of Lafayette College with two degrees and was proficient in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Classical Latin and Greek. He served as Professor of Languages and athletic director.\n\nDoggie Julian was the head football coach at Albright from 1929 to 1930. Clarence Lester \"Biggie\" Munn was the head football coach at Albright College from 1935 to 1936, before coaching Syracuse University (1946), and most notably Michigan State College (1947–1953), where his 1952 squad won a national championship.\n\nWilliam \"Lone Star\" Dietz was the Director of Athletics and head football coach at Albright from 1937 to 1942. Dietz led the football team to their first undefeated season in 1937. He previously led Washington State to 1916 Rose Bowl victory. In the National Football League, Dietz had coached the Boston \"Redskins\" (1933–1934), the forerunner of the Washington Redskins. Dietz is in the Albright College Athletic Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1948, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and Albright College played the first intercollegiate football game between an Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) institution and a majority-white institution.\n\nDr. Wilbur G. Renken was athletic director and basketball head coach for 38 consecutive seasons. A highly regarded figure in collegiate athletics in general and specifically basketball, Renken was the president of the United States Olympic Basketball Team Selection Committee for the 1976 Olympic Games. He also served as the president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) in 1979–1980.\n\nOn October 11, 2017, sophomore backup quarterback Gyree Durante was dismissed from the football team for kneeling during the national anthem before the team's game against Delaware Valley University, going against a collective team decision made before the game to kneel for the coin toss and stand for the anthem. President Fetrow later offered reinstatement to the team to Durante (and two other players who did not fully kneel during the coin toss), saying that further review of the details surrounding the game's events found that \"what we understood to be shared agreement among players, student leaders and coaches has not been adequately supported.”. Durante, however, declined reinstatement, citing his former teammates' stated lack of trust in him.\n\nAlbright's campus radio station, WXAC 91.3 FM is a student-operated college radio station.

Unlike many evangelicals, however, those on the evangelical left often support and utilize modern biblical criticism and are open to more progressive interpretations of Christian beliefs. They often support a more progressive political platform as well. Many, for example, are opposed to capital punishment and supportive of gun control and welfare programs. In many cases, they are also pacifists. While members of the evangelical left chiefly reside in mainline denominations, they are often heavily influenced by the Anabaptist social tradition. While the evangelical left is related to the wider Christian left, those who are part of the latter category are not always viewed as evangelical.\n\nIn his 2014 book, \"Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism (Politics and Culture in Modern America)\", David R. Swartz argues that during the 1960s and 1970s the evangelical left stood for antiwar, civil rights, and anticonsumer principles while supporting doctrinal and sexual fidelity. Swartz documents the activities of large organizations of the evangelical left included the Sojourners, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Evangelicals for Social Action, and the Association for Public Justice. He also explains how the evangelical left helped influence the broader evangelical movement by helping to elect the first born-again U.S. president, Jimmy Carter, and showing the evangelical right how to politically organize.\n\n\n\n"}

She was known for her cute, nostalgic drawings of children, based on her daughter, Peggy. Her drawings are featured on many postcards, advertisements, posters, books and figurines.\n\nAttwell was born in Mile End, London, 4 June 1879, the sixth child of butcher Augustus Attwell and his wife Emily Ann. She was educated privately and at the Coopers' Company School and at the Regent Street school. She studied at Heatherley's and Saint Martin's School of Art, but left to develop her own interest in imaginary subjects, disliking the emphasis on still-life drawing and classical subjects. \n\nAfter she sold work to the \"Tatler\" and \"Bystander\", she was taken on by the agents Francis and Mills, leading to a long and consistently successful career. In 1908, she married painter and illustrator Harold Cecil Earnshaw (d. 1937) with whom she had a daughter, Marjorie, and two sons. She died at her home in Fowey, Cornwall, on 5 November 1964, after which her business was carried on by her daughter, Marjorie.\n\nAttwell's initial career was founded on magazine illustration, which she continued throughout her life, but around 1900 she began receiving commissions for book illustration, notably for W & R Chambers and the Raphael House Library of Gift Books. Her early works were somewhat derivative of the style of artists such as her friend Hilda Cowham, Jessie Willcox Smith, John Hassall, and the Heath Robinson brothers. From 1914 onwards, she developed her trademark style of sentimentalised rotund cuddly infants, which became ubiquitous across a wide range of markets: cards, calendars, nursery equipment and pictures, crockery and dolls. During the 1910s Attwell produced a number of posters for London Transport featuring the childen to promote travel to Christmas pantomimes and other causes.\n\nShe illustrated children's classics such as \"Mother Goose\" (1910), \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1911), \"Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales\" (1914), \"The Water Babies\" by Charles Kingsley (1915), and an edition of J. M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan and Wendy\" abridged and written by May Byron (1921). For the gift books published by Messrs Raphael Tuck (\"Mother Goose\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", and later volumes including \"Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales\" (1913) and \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\" (1925)), she provided line drawings as well as \"colour work for twelve full-page half-tone plates.\" Attwell's illustrations caught the attention of Queen Marie of Romania, who wrote children's books and short stories in English. Attwell was invited to spend several weeks at the royal palace in Bucharest in 1922. She also illustrated two long stories of the queen's, which were published by Hodder and Stoughton. \n\nAttwell contributed illustrations to popular periodicals such as \"Tatler\", \"The Bystander\", \"The Daily Graphic\", and \"The Illustrated London News\". She produced advertising illustrations for clients such as Vim, and illustrated greeting cards as well. The \"Lucie Attwell Annual\" was published from 1922 to 1974, its continuing publication ten years after her death being made possible by extensive re-use of images.\n\nIn 1926 Shelley Potteries commissioned Attwell to produce designs for children's china ware, following the successful sales of china decorated with designs by Hilda Cowham. Attwell’s first six designs portrayed scenes involving children, animals and small green elves in green suits – these were called 'Boo Boos' and used on cups, mugs, bowls etc. \n\nShe also produced a tea set, comprising a teapot in the shape of a mushroom house, a sugar bowl in the shape of a mushroom with the top cut off and a milk jug in the shape of a green Boo Boo in a coy saluting pose. The response to these designs was enthusiastic and the \"Pottery Gazette\" wrote that they were \"a truly irresistible range of nursery ware, altogether in advance of what was usually put before the trade.\" Her success continued and from 1937 a series of children figures was introduced, followed by a series of small elves in various poses. Attwell continued to produce designs for Shelley ware which was still being manufactured in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1943 she also had her own comic strip, named \"Wot A Life\", published in the magazine \"Playbox\". \n\nIn 1908, she married painter and illustrator Harold Cecil Earnshaw and became the mother of one daughter and two sons.\n\n\n\n"}

It does well in moist conditions, but also can tolerate dry conditions as long as water is available. It often lives around the perimeter of buildings.

{"id": "1972167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972167", "title": "Coherence theory of truth", "text": "Coherence theory of truth\n\nIn epistemology, the coherence theory of truth regards truth as coherence within some specified set of sentences, propositions or beliefs. The model is contrasted with the correspondence theory of truth.\n\nA positive tenet is the idea that truth is a property of whole systems of propositions and can be ascribed to individual propositions only derivatively according to their coherence with the whole. While modern coherence theorists hold that there are many possible systems to which the determination of truth may be based upon coherence, others, particularly those with strong religious beliefs hold that the truth only applies to a single absolute system. In general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within the whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple formal coherence. For example, the coherence of the underlying set of concepts is considered to be a critical factor in judging validity. In other words, the set of base concepts in a universe of discourse must form an intelligible paradigm before many theorists consider that the coherence theory of truth is applicable.\n\nIn modern philosophy, the coherence theory of truth was defended by Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Harold Henry Joachim (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory). However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth. In contemporary philosophy, several epistemologists have significantly contributed to and defended the theory, primarily Brand Blanshard (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times) and Nicholas Rescher.\n\nAccording to one view, the coherence theory of truth regards truth as coherence within some specified set of sentences, propositions or beliefs. It is the \"theory of knowledge which maintains that truth is a property primarily applicable to any extensive body of consistent propositions, and derivatively applicable to any one proposition in such a system by virtue of its part in the system\". Ideas like this are a part of the philosophical perspective known as \"confirmation holism\". Coherence theories of truth claim that coherence and consistency are important features of a theoretical system, and that these properties are \"sufficient\" to its truth. To state it in the reverse, that \"truth\" exists only within a system, and doesn't exist outside of a system.\n\nAccording to another version by H. H. Joachim (the philosopher credited with the definitive formulation of the theory, in his book \"The Nature of Truth\", published in 1906), truth is a \"systematic coherence\" that involves more than logical consistency. In this view, a proposition is true to the extent that it is a necessary constituent of a systematically coherent whole. Others of this school of thought, for example, Brand Blanshard, hold that this whole must be so interdependent that every element in it necessitates and even entails every other element. Exponents of this view infer that the most complete truth is a property solely of a unique coherent system, called the \"absolute\", and that humanly knowable propositions and systems have a degree of truth that is proportionate to how fully they approximate this ideal.\n\nPerhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is Bertrand Russell's. He maintained that since both a belief and its negation will, individually, cohere with at least one set of beliefs, this means that contradictory beliefs can be shown to be true according to coherence theory, and therefore that the theory cannot work. However, what most coherence theorists are concerned with is not all possible beliefs, but the set of beliefs that people actually hold. The main problem for a coherence theory of truth, then, is how to specify just this particular set, given that the truth of which beliefs are actually held can only be determined by means of coherence.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972169", "title": "Parson", "text": "Parson\n\nIn the pre-Reformation church, a parson is the priest of an independent parish church, that is, a parish church not under the control of a larger ecclesiastical or monastic organization. The term is similar to rector and is in contrast to a vicar, a cleric whose revenue is usually, at least partially, appropriated by a larger organization. Today the term is normally used for some parish clergy of non-Roman Catholic churches, in particular in the Anglican tradition in which a parson is the incumbent of a parochial benefice: a parish priest or a rector; in this sense a parson can be compared with a vicar. The title \"parson\" can be applied to clergy from certain other Protestant denominations. A parson is often housed in a church-owned home known as a parsonage.\n\nWilliam Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" says that a \"parson\" is a parish priest with the fullest legal rights to the parish properties:\n\nLegally, parish priests are separately given spiritual and temporal jurisdiction (they are instituted and inducted). The spiritual responsibility is termed the \"cure of souls\", and one holding such a cure is a curate, which was also given to parish assistants, or assistant curates. The title \"parson\", however, refers to the temporal jurisdiction over the churches and glebe. Depending on how the tithes were apportioned, a parson may be a rector or a vicar. A parish priest who received no tithes was legally a \"perpetual curate\" (to distinguish him from assistant curates). \n\nHowever, historically, many perpetual curates, as they were technically parsons (having temporal jurisdiction), preferred to use this latter title. This led to the term \"parson\" having three senses. It could refer to any clergyman who was in charge of the parish church (rectors, vicars or perpetual curates) without distinction; it could, through actual use, refer simply to perpetual curates, or it could, through popular use, refer to any member of the clergy, even assistant curates. An Act of Parliament in 1868, changed the way that parochial clergy were paid, and permitted perpetual curates to be called vicars. This led to the rapid abandonment of the title \"parson\" in favour of \"vicar\", to the extent that now, as previously for parson, the term \"vicar\" is often used for any cleric of the Church of England. \n\nIn Ulster, in the early 17th century, every parish had a vicar and a parson instead of a co-arb and an erenagh. The vicar, like the co-arb, was always in orders. He said the mass (‘serveth the cure’) and received a share of the tithes. The parson, like the erenagh, had a major portion of the tithes, maintained the church and provided hospitality. As he was not usually in clerical orders, his responsibilities were mainly temporal.\n\nHowever, there were differences in the divisions of the tithes between various dioceses in Tyrone. In the Diocese of Clogher, the vicar and the parson shared the tithes equally between them; in the Diocese of Derry, church income came from both tithes and the rental of church lands (‘temporalities’). The vicar and the parson each received one third of the tithes and paid an annual tribute to the bishop. In places where there was no parson, the erenagh continued to receive two thirds of the income in kind from the church lands, and delivered the balance, after defraying maintenance, to the Bishop in cash as a yearly rental. In other places, the parson, the vicar and the erenagh shared the costs of church repairs equally between them. In the Diocese of Armagh the parson received two-thirds of the tithes and the vicar one third. The archbishop and the erenagh impropriated no part thereof because they received the entire income from the termon lands.\n\n"}

{"id": "1972173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972173", "title": "Sexploitation film", "text": "Sexploitation film\n\nA sexploitation film (or \"sex-exploitation film\") is a class of independently produced, low-budget feature film that is generally associated with the 1960s, and that serves largely as a vehicle for the exhibition of non-explicit sexual situations and gratuitous nudity. The genre is a subgenre of exploitation films. Sexploitation films were generally exhibited in urban grindhouse theatres, the precursor to the adult movie theaters of the 1970s and 1980s that featured hardcore pornography content. The term soft-core is often used to designate non-explicit sexploitation films after the general legalisation of hardcore content. Nudist films are often considered to be subgenres of the sex-exploitation genre as well. \"Nudie\" films and \"Nudie-cuties\" are associated genres.\n\nFollowing a series of United States Supreme Court rulings in the late 1950s and 1960s, increasingly explicit sex films were distributed. In 1957, \"Roth v. United States\" established that sex and obscenity were not synonymous. The genre first emerged in the U.S. around 1960. \n\nThere were initially three broad types: \"nudie cuties\" such as \"The Immoral Mr. Teas\" (1959), films set in nudist camps like \"Daughter of the Sun\" (1962) and somewhat more \"artistic\" foreign pictures, such as \"The Twilight Girls\" (1961). Nudie cuties were popular in the early 1960s, and were a progression from the nudist camp films of the 1950s. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that films set in nudist camps were exempt from the general ban on film nudity, as they were deemed to be educational. In the early 1960s, films that purported to be documentaries and were thus \"educational\" enabled sexploitation producers to evade the censors. \n\nNudie cuties were soon supplanted by \"roughies,\" which commonly featured male violence against women, including kidnapping, rape and murder. \"Lorna\" (1964) by Russ Meyer is widely considered to be the first roughie. Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman's \"Scum of the Earth!\" (1963) is another film that is cited as among the first in this genre. Other notable roughie directors include Doris Wishman.\n\nSexploitation films initially played in grindhouse theatres and struggling independent theaters; however, by the end of the decade they were playing in established cinema chains. As the genre developed during the 1960s films began showing scenes of simulated sex. The films were opposed by religious groups and by the MPAA, which was concerned that sexploitation films were cutting into the profits of major film distributors. Customers who attended screenings of sexploitation films were often characterised by the mainstream media as deviant, \"dirty old men\" and \"raincoaters.\" \n\nIn the mid-1960s some newspapers began banning advertizements for the films. By the late 1960s the films were attracting a larger and broader audience, however, including couples rather than the single males who originally made up the vast majority of patrons. The genre rapidly declined in the early 1970s due to advertising bans, the closure of many grindhouses and drive-in theaters and the growth of hardcore pornography in the \"Golden Age of Porn.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s, American obscenity laws were tested by the Swedish film \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\". After the 1969 ruling by the Supreme Court that the film was not obscene because of its educational context, the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of sexploitation films produced following this same format. These were widely referred to as \"white coaters,\" because, in these films, a doctor dressed in a white coat would give an introduction to the graphic content that followed, qualifying the film as \"educational.\" The ruling led to a surge in the production of sex films. \"Language of Love\" and other Swedish and American films capitalised on this idea until the laws were relaxed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972195", "title": "Henry Johnson (World War I soldier)", "text": "Henry Johnson (World War I soldier)\n\nWilliam Henry Johnson (circa July 15, 1892 – July 1, 1929), commonly known as Henry Johnson, was a United States Army soldier who performed heroically in the first African American unit of the United States Army to engage in combat in World War I. On watch in the Argonne Forest on May 14, 1918, he fought off a German raid in hand-to-hand combat, killing multiple German soldiers and rescuing a fellow soldier while experiencing 21 wounds, in an action that was brought to the nation's attention by coverage in the \"New York World\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\" later that year. On June 2, 2015 he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama in a posthumous ceremony at the White House.\n\nIn 1918, racism against African Americans was common among white U.S. soldiers in the U.S. military, but French attitudes differed. Johnson was recognized by the French with a Croix de guerre with star and bronze palm, and was the first U.S. soldier in World War I to receive that honor.\n\nJohnson died, poor and in obscurity, in 1929. From 1919 on, Henry Johnson's story has been part of wider consideration of treatment of African Americans in the Great War. There was a long struggle to achieve awards for him from the U.S. military. He was finally awarded the Purple Heart in 1996. In 2002, the U.S. military awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross. Previous efforts to secure the Medal of Honor failed, but in 2015 he was posthumously honored with the award.\n\nJohnson said that he was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on July 15, 1892, when he registered for the World War I draft, but he used other dates on other documents, so he might not have known the exact date of his birth. He moved to Albany, New York, when he was in his early teens. He worked as a redcap porter at the Albany Union Station on Broadway.\n\nJohnson enlisted in the United States Military on June 5, 1917, joining the all-black New York National Guard 15th Infantry Regiment, which, when mustered into Federal service, was redesignated as the 369th Infantry Regiment based in Harlem.\n\nThe 369th Infantry joined the 185th Infantry Brigade upon arrival in France, but the unit was relegated to labor service duties instead of combat training. The 185th Infantry Brigade was in turn assigned on January 5, 1918, to the 93rd Infantry Division.\nAlthough General John J. Pershing wished to keep the U.S. Army autonomous, he \"loaned\" the 369th to the 161st Division of the French Army. Supposedly, the unreported and unofficial reason he was willing to detach the African-American regiments from U.S. command was that vocal white U.S. soldiers refused to fight alongside black troops. These regiments suffered considerable harassment by white U.S. soldiers and even denigration by the American Expeditionary Force headquarters, which went so far as to release the notorious pamphlet \"Secret Information Concerning Black American Troops\", which \"warned\" French civilian authorities of the alleged inferior nature and supposed tendencies of African-American troops to commit sexual assaults. Johnson arrived in France on New Year's Day, 1918.\n\nThe French Army and people had no such problem and were happy and welcoming to accept the reinforcements. Among the first regiments to arrive in France, and among the most highly decorated when it returned, was the 369th Infantry, which later became famous as the \"Harlem Hellfighters.\" The 369th was an all-black regiment under the command of mostly white officers including their commander, Colonel William Hayward. The idea of a black New York National Guard regiment was first put forward by Charles W. Fillmore, a black New Yorker. Governor Charles Seymour Whitman, inspired by the brave showing of the black 10th Cavalry in Mexico, authorized the project. He appointed Colonel Hayward to carry out the task of organizing the unit, and Hayward gave Fillmore a commission as a captain in the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard. The 15th New York Infantry Regiment became the 369th United States Infantry Regiment prior to engaging in combat in France.\nThe 369th got off to a rocky departure from the United States, making three attempts over a period of months to sail for France before finally getting out of sight of land. Even then, their transport, which had stopped and anchored because of a sudden snow storm that arose before they could get out of the harbor, was struck by another ship due to the poor visibility. The captain of the transport, the \"Pocahontas\", wanted to turn back, much to the dismay of his passengers. The by now angry and impatient members of the 369th, led by Hayward, took a very dim view of any further delay. Since the damage to the ship was well above the water line, the ship's captain admitted that there was no danger of sinking. Hayward then informed the captain that he saw no reason to turn back except cowardice. Hayward's men repaired the damage themselves and the ship sailed on. According to Hayward's notes, they \"landed at Brest. Right side up\" on December 27, 1917. They acquitted themselves well once they finally got to France. However, it was a while before they saw combat.\n\nThe French Army assigned Johnson's regiment to Outpost 20 on the edge of the Argonne Forest in the Champagne region of France and equipped them with French rifles and helmets. While on observation post duty on the night of May 14, 1918, Private Johnson came under attack by a large German raiding party, which may have numbered as many as 24 German soldiers. Using grenades, the butt of his rifle, a bolo knife, and his bare fists, Johnson repelled the Germans, thereby rescuing Needham Roberts from capture and saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. Johnson suffered 21 wounds during this ordeal. This act of valor earned him the nickname of \"Black Death\", as a sign of respect for his prowess in combat.\n\nThe story of Johnson's exploits first came to national attention in an article by Irvin S. Cobb entitled \"Young Black Joe\" published in the August 24, 1918 \"Saturday Evening Post\".\n\nReturning home, now Sergeant Johnson participated (with his regiment) in a victory parade on Fifth Avenue in New York City in February 1919. Johnson was then paid to take part in a series of lecture tours. He appeared one evening in St. Louis, and instead of delivering the expected tale of racial harmony in the trenches, he instead revealed the abuse that black soldiers had suffered, such as white soldiers refusing to share trenches with blacks. Soon after this a warrant was issued for Johnson's arrest for wearing his uniform beyond the prescribed date of his commission and paid lecturing engagements dried up.\n\nThe French government awarded Johnson the Croix de guerre with a special citation and a golden palm. He was the first American to receive the award.\n\nIn June 1996, Johnson was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart by President Bill Clinton. In February 2003, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second highest award, was presented to Herman A. Johnson, one of the Tuskegee Airmen, on behalf of his father. John Howe, a Vietnam War veteran who had campaigned tirelessly for recognition for Johnson, and U.S. Army Major General Nathaniel James, President of the 369th Veterans' Association, were present at the ceremony in Albany.\n\nOn May 14, 2015, the White House announced that Johnson would receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, presented by President Barack Obama. In the June 2 ceremony, Johnson's medal was received on his behalf by Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard. Obama said, \"The least we can do is to say, 'We know who you are, we know what you did for us. We are forever grateful.'\"\n\nOn June 2, 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard on behalf of Private Johnson. The award was presented to Wilson instead of next-of-kin due to Johnson having no living relatives. The official citation reads:\n\nVeterans Bureau records show that a \"permanent and total disability\" rating was granted to Johnson on September 16, 1927, as a result of his tuberculosis. Additional Veterans Bureau records refer to Johnson receiving monthly compensation and regular visits by Veterans Bureau medical personnel until his death.\n\nJohnson died on July 1, 1929, in Washington, D.C., of myocarditis. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on July 6, 1929.\n\nIn 1919, co-founder of the American Legion Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., son of former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, referred to Johnson as one of the \"five bravest Americans\" to have served in World War I.\n\nInterest in obtaining fitting recognition for Johnson grew during the 1970s and 1980s. In November 1991 a monument was erected in Albany, New York's Washington Park in his honor, and a section of Northern Boulevard was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard.\n\nIn December 2004, the Postal facility at 747 Broadway was renamed the \"United States Postal Service Henry Johnson Annex\".\n\nOn September 4, 2007, the Brighter Choice Foundation in Albany, New York dedicated the Henry Johnson Charter School. Johnson's granddaughter was in attendance.\n\nA 1918 commercial poster honoring Johnson's wartime heroics was the subject of a 2012 episode of the PBS television series \"History Detectives\".\n\nAs of December 3, 2014, the national defense bill included a provision, added by Senator Chuck Schumer, to award Johnson the Medal of Honor.\n\nFor many years, it was thought that Herman Archibald Johnson was the son of Henry Johnson. In tracking Henry Johnson's genealogy prior to his being awarded the Medal of Honor, however, it was discovered that there was not a family connection. Regarding this, the Army was quoted as saying, \"While we appreciate the Johnson family fighting for the award and keeping the memory and valorous acts of Henry Johnson alive, we regretfully cannot recognize them as PNOK,\" or primary next of kin.\n\nIn December 2014, the City School District of Albany established a Junior Reserve officers' Training Program (JROTC) at Albany High School named the Henry Johnson Battalion in honor of Johnson. Currently the program enrolls over 100 cadets.\n\nIn 2017, Albany, NY area PBS station WMHT aired a documentary about Henry Johnson entitled \"Henry Johnson: A Tale of Courage.\"\n\n\n"}

She starred in Andy Warhol's films \"Flesh\" (1968) and \"Women in Revolt\" (1971), and was a muse of The Velvet Underground.\nCandy Darling was born in Forest Hills, Queens, the child of Theresa Slattery, a bookkeeper at Manhattan's Jockey Club, and James (\"Jim\") Slattery, who was described as a violent alcoholic.\n\nDarling's early years were spent in Massapequa Park, Long Island, where she and her mother moved after the parents' divorce. She spent much of her childhood watching television and old Hollywood movies, from which she learned to impersonate her favorite actresses, such as Joan Bennett and Kim Novak. She had one half-brother, Warren Law II, from her mother's first marriage to Warren Law. Warren Law II left to serve in the United States military and left Darling as the only child. Law would later deny his connection to Darling.\n\nIn a biography about Darling, Cynthia Carr reveals that Darling was \"relentlessly bullied\" in high school and dropped out at the age of 16 after a group of boys tried to lynch her.\n\nIn 1961, she signed up for a course at the DeVern School of Cosmetology in Baldwin, Long Island. Darling later said that she \"learned about the mysteries of sex from a salesman in a local children's shoe store\" and finally revealed an inclination towards cross-dressing when her mother confronted her about local rumors, which described Darling as \"dressing as a girl\" and frequenting a local gay bar called The Hayloft. In response, Darling left the room and returned in feminine clothing. Darling's mother would later say that, \"I knew then... that I couldn't stop Jimmy. Candy was just too beautiful and talented.\"\n\nAfter coming out publicly, Darling would take a short cab ride to the Long Island Rail Road station, avoiding the attention of neighbors she would receive by walking to the train. From there, she would take the train to Manhattan, often sitting across from Long Island starlet Joey Heatherton. In Manhattan, she would refer to her family home at 79 First Avenue in Massapequa Park as her \"country house\", and spent time in Greenwich Village, meeting people through Seymour Levy on Bleecker Street.\n\nDarling met Jeremiah Newton in the summer of 1966, when Newton was on his first trip to Greenwich Village from his home in Flushing, Queens. The two became friends and roommates, living together in Manhattan and Brooklyn until the time of Darling's death in 1974.\n\nDarling first took the name Hope Slattery. According to Bob Colacello, Darling took this name in 1963/1964 after she started going to gay bars in Manhattan and visiting a doctor on Fifth Avenue for hormone injections. Jackie Curtis said that Darling adopted the name from a well-known Off Broadway actress named Hope Stansbury, with whom she lived for a few months in an apartment behind the Caffe Cino. Holly Woodlawn remembers that Darling's name evolved from Hope Dahl to Candy Dahl, then to Candy Cane. Jeremiah Newton said she took the name \"Candy\" out of a love for sweets. In her autobiography, Woodlawn recalled that Darling had adopted the name because a friend of hers called her \"darling\" so often that it stuck.\n\nBefore they met, in 1967, Darling saw Andy Warhol at The Tenth of Always, an after-hours club. Darling was with Jackie Curtis, who invited Warhol to a play that she had written and directed, called \"Glamour, Glory and Gold\", starring Darling as \"Nona Noonan\" and a young Robert De Niro, who played six parts in the play.\n\nWarhol cast Darling in a short comedic scene in \"Flesh\" (1968) with Jackie Curtis and Joe Dallesandro. After \"Flesh\", Darling was cast in a central role in \"Women in Revolt\" (1971).\n\n\"Women in Revolt\" was first shown at the first Los Angeles Filmex as \"Sex\". It was later shown as \"Andy Warhol's Women.\"\n\nThe day after the celebrity preview, a group of women carrying protest signs demonstrated outside the cinema against the film, which they thought was anti-women's liberation. When Darling heard about this, she said, \"Who do these dykes think they are anyway? Well, I just hope they all read Vincent Canby's review in today's \"Times.\" He said I look like a cross between Kim Novak and Pat Nixon. It's true – I do have Pat Nixon's nose.\" \n\nDarling worked for a short time as a barmaid at Slugger Ann's, the bar owned by Jackie Curtis's grandmother.\n\nDarling went on to appear in other independent films, including \"Silent Night, Bloody Night\", Wynn Chamberlain's \"Brand X,\" and a co-starring role in \"Some of My Best Friends Are...\" She appeared in \"Klute\" with Jane Fonda and \"Lady Liberty\" with Sophia Loren. In 1971, she went to Vienna to make two films with director Werner Schroeter:\"The Death of Maria Malibran\", and another film that was never released. Darling's attempt at breaking into mainstream movies, by campaigning for the leading role in \"Myra Breckinridge\" (1970), led to rejection and bitterness.\n\nHer theatre credits include two Jackie Curtis plays, \"Glamour, Glory and Gold\" (1967) and \"Vain Victory: The Vicissitudes of the Damned\" (1971). \"Vain Victory\" was directed by Curtis at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in May/June 1971, and featured many other performers from Warhol's Factory, including Curtis, Ondine, Tally Brown, Mario Montez, Samuel Adams Green, Mary Woronov, Francesco Scavullo, Jay Johnson (twin brother of Jed Johnson), Holly Woodlawn, Steina and Woody Vasulka, Eric Emerson, and Warhol himself.\n\nDarling was in the original 1972 production of Tennessee Williams' play \"Small Craft Warnings\", cast at Williams' request. She starred in the 1973 revival of \"The White Whore and the Bit Player\", a 1964 play by Tom Eyen, at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. The production was bilingual, called \"The White Whore and the Bit Player/La Estrelle y La Monja\", and directed by Manuel Martin Jr. Darling's character, a Hollywood actress known only as \"the Whore\", was based on Marilyn Monroe. She performed in the English version opposite Hortensia Colorado, and the Spanish version was performed by Magaly Alabau and Graciela Mas. As a review of the play stated, \"With her teased platinum hair and practiced pouts, Miss Darling looks like her character and resolutely keeps her acting little-girl-lost. The role-playing aspect works to her advantage. She could, after all, be a male lunatic pretending to be the White Whore.\"\n\nDarling died of lymphoma on March 21, 1974, aged 29, at the Columbus Hospital division of the Cabrini Health Care Center. In a letter written on her deathbed and intended for Warhol and his followers, Darling wrote, \"Unfortunately before my death I had no desire left for life ... I am just so bored by everything. You might say bored to death. Did you know I couldn't last. I always knew it. I wish I could meet you all again.\"\n\nHer funeral, held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, was attended by huge crowds. Julie Newmar read the eulogy. Darling's birth name was never spoken by the minister or any of the eulogizers. Faith Dane played a piano piece, and Gloria Swanson saluted Darling's coffin.\n\nDarling was cremated, and her ashes were interred by Jeremiah Newton in the Cherry Valley Cemetery in Cherry Valley, New York, a village at the foot of the Catskill Mountains.\n\nA feature-length documentary on Darling, titled \"Beautiful Darling\", premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival (or Berlinale) in February 2010. The documentary features archival film and video footage, photographs, personal papers, archival audio interviews with Tennessee Williams, Valerie Solanas, Jackie Curtis and Darling's mother, as well as contemporary interviews with Holly Woodlawn, Fran Lebowitz, John Waters, Julie Newmar, Peter Beard, and Taylor Mead. Chloë Sevigny narrates the film, voicing Darling's private diary entries and personal letters. The film was directed by James Rasin and produced by Jeremiah Newton and Elisabeth Bentley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2019, a biopic about Candy was announced.

It contains the enzyme alpha-galactosidase (α-GAL). It was introduced as a liquid, but that has been discontinued and it is now available only as tablets and strawberry-flavored \"Meltaways\".\n\nBeano is marketed and distributed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\nBeano contains the enzyme α-GAL, which is derived from the fungus \"Aspergillus niger\". The enzyme works in the digestive tract to break down the complex or branching sugars (polysaccharides and oligosaccharides) in foods such as legumes (beans and peanuts) and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts, among others). The enzyme breaks those complex sugars into simple sugars, making these foods somewhat more digestible, and reducing intestinal gas.\n\nThe polysaccharides and oligosaccharides found in these foods might otherwise pass through the small intestine unaffected. Once in the large intestine, those sugars may be metabolized by intestinal flora, fermenting to produce the gases that cause discomfort and flatulence.\n\nTwo randomized controlled trials show reduction in gas by subjects taking oral α-GAL. Another study indicates it may interfere with the diabetic medication acarbose.\n\nBeano was developed in 1990 by Alan Kligerman of AkPharma after research into gas-causing vegetables that had begun in 1981.

In 1991, Kligerman was awarded the inaugural Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine for inventing Beano.\n\nIts patent was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in 2001 from Block Drug.

The complex sugars are not broken down by the yeast, and are eventually consumed by the beer drinker, possibly causing flatulence. Homebrewers have found adding Beano to their brew may produce a beer that has a less malty flavor. The Beano breaks the complex sugars into simple sugars, and these simple sugars are consumed by the yeast, producing alcohol (or some acetic acid in the aerobic reactions in early fermentation).\n"}

She retained her former name.\n\nBefore being pressed into service by the United States Navy, the SS \"James Adger\" was a United States Mail Steamship operating between Charleston, South Carolina and New York City, New York. Owned by James Adger II (James Adger & Co) of Charleston, she was seized while in New York City at the outset of the Civil War and converted for military duty by the Union Navy.\n\n\"James Adger\" was built at New York City by William H. Webb in 1851. Her side-lever engine was supplied by the Allaire Iron Works.\n\n\"James Adger\" was purchased at New York for the sum of $85,000 from Spofford, Tileston & Co., on 20 July 1861, and commissioned at New York Navy Yard on 20 September 1861, Commander John B. Marchand in command.\n\n\"James Adger\" departed New York on 16 October 1861 in pursuit of the CSS \"Nashville\", a Confederate cruiser reported to have escaped from Charleston, South Carolina with the South's ministers to England and France, James M. Mason and John Slidell. She arrived at Queenstown, Ireland after an extremely stormy passage in October and spent November cruising in quest of her elusive quarry. The diplomats were apprehended by on 8 November.\n\nWhile in port, the captain of \" James Adger\" began the legal questions that would be used in the Trent Affair by loudly speaking of his mission while intoxicated on brandy. Earl Russell would hear of his mission and set the Law offices of the Crown to work deciding on the status of diplomats as a form of contraband.\n\n\"James Adger\" arrived Hampton Roads, Va. on 2 December and three days later was ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina for duty in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont ordered Comdr. Marchand to sail in \"James Adger\" to Georgetown, S.C., and assume command of the blockade there. She arrived off Georgetown, S.C. on 24 December and served with such efficiency that on 7 March 1862, Comdr. Marchand was ordered to Charleston to command the blockade at that critical port.\n\nAt Charleston, smooth teamwork was the key to success, and \"James Adger\" was unusually adept in cooperating with other ships in the area to assure the effectiveness of the blockade. As senior ship, she usually remained on station while others chased blockade runners; from time to time, she took part in a capture herself. On 18 March, she joined four other Union ships in capturing \"Emily St. Pierre\" attempting to slip into Charleston with a cargo of 2,173 bales of gunny cloth sorely needed for baling cotton, the South's main export and source of foreign credit. She helped on 29 May in capturing \"Elizabeth\", a steamer trying to enter Charleston with a cargo of munitions. She assisted \"Keystone State\" and in driving off and pursuing her old adversary \"Nashville\" — now a blockade runner named \"Thomas L. Wragg\" — trying to slip into Charleston.\n\n\"James Adger\" sailed for Baltimore on 19 September for repairs and departed for the South on 31 December touching at Hampton Roads on 2 January 1863 to take monitor in tow before proceeding to Beaufort and Port Royal in preparation for an attack on Charleston. Arriving Port Royal on 19 January, the ships learned that \"Nashville\", now a privateer called \"Rattlesnake\", was in the Ogeechee River. \"James Adger\" stood out of Port Royal, monitor \"Montauk\" in tow on 22 January and steamed to Ossabaw Sound, where she arrived two days later. \"Montauk\" ascended the Ogeechee independently to begin operations which resulted in the destruction of \"Rattlesnake\" on 28 February. Meanwhile, \"James Adger\" — her vital towing service completed — returned to Port Royal on 29 January.\n\nOn 2 April, the veteran ship became flagship for Rear Admiral Du Pont while he supervised final preparations for his powerful monitor attack upon Charleston. After the tough ironclads were driven back by incredibly intense fire from Confederate batteries, \"James Adger\" towed crippled monitors to Port Royal and on 29 April sailed from Port Royal towing north for repairs, arriving New York on 4 May.\n\nBack in Port Royal on 16 May, \"James Adger\" was assigned blockade duty off Charleston. A month later, she was recalled to Port Royal to embark prisoners captured with Atlanta for passage to Fort Monroe, whence she steamed to Philadelphia for repairs. She arrived Philadelphia 25 June but immediately after coaling sailed in pursuit of Confederate commerce railer CSS \"Tacony\", then operating against Union merchantmen far up the East Coast. She arrived New York on 3 July.\n\nFour days later, \"James Adger\" — not yet repaired — received orders to Wilmington for duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Arriving Wilmington on 27 July, she was stationed off New Inlet, where five days later she assisted and in taking Confederate steamer \"Kate\". On 8 November, with the assistance of she captured \"Cornubia\", an iron side wheeler bringing in a valuable cargo of arms, ammunition, and chemicals. Moreover, a package of documents thrown overboard before the capture, when plucked out of the sea, divulged information so important to the South that \"Cornubia\"s captain lamented, \"though the \"Cornubia\" is a small vessel the Confederate Government could better have afforded to lose almost any other...\" The next morning, \"James Adger\" took Confederate steamer \"Robert E. Lee\" coming into Wilmington from Bermuda with a cargo of arms and Army clothing sorely needed by Lee's soldiers. Schooner \"Ella\", approaching Wilmington with a cargo of salt and yard goods from Nassau, Bahamas, was \"James Adger\"s next victim, surrendering on 26 November.\n\nWithout the normal overhaul periods due ships and men, service was taking a daily toll in wear and tear. When the ship's long postponed repairs could be delayed no longer, \"James Adger\" sailed north and decommissioned at Philadelphia on 28 December for the necessary yard work.\n\nAfter recommissioning on 17 June 1864, \"James Adger\" served in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron until the end of the war. On 21 April 1865, Secretary Gideon Welles ordered her to Mariguana Passage (now Mayaguana Passage) in the Bahamas to escort a convoy of California-bound ships. Following a visit to New York, she cruised in the Caribbean off Panama and Colombia from August 1865-February 1866.\n\n\"James Adger\" decommissioned at New York Navy Yard on 2 May and was sold at New York to James B. Campbell on 9 October.\n\nAs of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named \"James Adger\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1972231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972231", "title": "Flipper (1963 film)", "text": "Flipper (1963 film)\n\nFlipper is an American feature film released on August 14, 1963 written by Arthur Weiss based upon a story by Ricou Browning and Jack Cowden. Produced by Ivan Tors and directed by James B. Clark, it portrays a 12-year-old boy living with his parents in the Florida Keys, who befriends an injured wild dolphin. The lad and his pet become inseparable, eventually overcoming the misgivings of his fisherman father.\n\nThe film introduced the popular song \"Flipper\", by Dunham and Henry Vars and inspired the subsequent television series of the same name (1964–1967) and film sequels.\n\nSandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) is a young boy living in the Florida Keys who rescues and befriends a dolphin injured by a harpoon. His father, fisherman Porter Ricks (Chuck Connors) disapproves, as dolphins compete for fish, which jeopardizes the family income. He is also upset that, after befriending the dolphin, Sandy neglects his chores - especially those assigned by his Dad, repairing various items damaged by a dangerous hurricane, from which Sandy and Porter escape at the beginning of the movie.\n\nAfter \"Flipper\" (as Sandy names his new friend) recovers from the wound, the dolphin puts on a show to entertain the neighborhood children. Porter, seeing Flipper as both a threat to his nets and fish and a distraction to Sandy's assigned post-hurricane clean-up chores, lets the recovered Flipper swim out of the pen to the open sea, despite Sandy's tearful pleadings to keep the pet he has come to love.\n\nHowever, later, Flipper returns to the Ricks' pen, much to Sandy's delight, but devours Porter's entire catch of pompano, which were caught only thanks to Flipper guiding Sandy to the fish. The loss is keenly felt due to a red plague killing local fish in large numbers. Porter harshly berates Sandy for allowing Flipper to jump into the holding pen of valuable fish waiting to go to market, \"What's wrong with you boy? How old are you, 12, almost in your teens? Or are you a child who doesn't have the sense to know what his next meal depends on?\" Reduced to tears, Sandy retreats to his bedroom as Porter's wife Martha (Kathleen Maguire) remonstrates that \"he's only a boy\".\n\nDetermined to make up for the loss, Sandy sets off to find more fish, and is led by Flipper to a large school of fish near a reef. Later, Sandy is rescued from a threatening shark by Flipper, and the grateful father draws closer to his son. Porter Ricks is finally convinced that Flipper did indeed help Sandy find fish and that there are enough fish for both the local residents of the area and the dolphins.\n\n\nCo-creator Ricou Browning said that he originally conceived the story after seeing his children intently watching the TV series \"Lassie\", which inspired Browning to create a similar story with a dolphin in place of the dog. After he sent the story to his friend, producer Ivan Tors, Tors expressed interest in making it into a movie.\n\nFilmed in color in 1962 and released in 1963, \"Flipper\" has several underwater sequences, along with scenes of the trained dolphin performing stunts. Flipper the dolphin was played by \"Mitzie\" (1958–1972), a female trained at the Santini Porpoise School (later the Dolphin Research Center), by Milton and Virginia Santini, who are credited in the film. Mitzie died in 1972 at age fourteen. She is buried at the Dolphin Research Center, where her grave is the first stop on the center's public tours.\n\nIn addition to Mitzie, four other dolphins were filmed for the production of the movie. Two of the dolphins, Little Bit, a female, and Mr. Gipper, a male, reproduced at the Dolphin Research Center. The calf was named Tursi, and she still lives at Dolphin Research Center as of 2011. Tursi has four offspring also living at Dolphin Research Center: Talon, Pax, Gypsi and Gambit.\n\nIn his 1974 book \"Friendly Porpoises\" William B. Grey, Animal Collection Manager for the Miami Seaquarium, has a photograph of dolphin trainer Jim Kline training a dolphin for a hurdle jump stunt for the film in the Seaquarium's main dolphin tank.\n\nA film sequel, \"Flipper's New Adventure\", was filmed in late 1963 and released in June 1964. That same year, a television series inspired by the movie, \"Flipper\", began and ran until 1967. A 1990s television revival featured Jessica Alba. In 1996, a movie remake was released, \"Flipper\", starring Paul Hogan and Elijah Wood.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972233", "title": "Freedom of religion in the Philippines", "text": "Freedom of religion in the Philippines\n\nFreedom of religion in the Philippines is guaranteed by the Constitution of the Philippines.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares: \"The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.\" (Article II, Section 6), and, \n\"No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.\" (Article III, Section 5)...\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Philippines, ruling in 2003 \nand 2006\nin the landmark case of \"Estrada vs. Escritor\", established the doctrine of benevolent neutrality-accommodation. The 2006 ruling, penned by former Chief Justice Puno, explained benevolent-neutrality in the context of U.S. jurisprudence as follows:\n\nThe ruling went on to cite a U.S. Supreme Court decision which had held that if prohibiting the exercise of religion is merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.\nThough concurring in the decision, Justice O'Connor dissented strongly from the rationale, arguing that a compelling state interest test should have been applied.\n\nEchoing Justice O'Connor's point from the U.S. case, the ruling in \"Estrada vs. Escritor\" went on to quote her as having said that strict scrutiny is appropriate for free exercise challenges because \"“[t]he compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment’s mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.\"\n\nThe ruling then declared \"Underlying the compelling state interest test is the notion that free exercise is a fundamental right and that laws burdening it should be subject to strict scrutiny\", and summarized a three-part compelling state interest test by quoting Michael W. McConnell as follows:\n\nThe ruling noted that the then-current prevailing view under U.S. law is that there are no required accommodation under the First Amendment, although it permits of legislative accommodations. Considering Philippine jurisprudence, though, the ruling said:\n\nThese landmark decisions in \"Estrada vs. Escritor\" established that benevolent neutrality-accommodation is the framework by which free exercise cases must be decided in the Philippines. This amounts to a requirement that any law which conflicts with a violator's sincerely held religious beliefs must pass a strict scrutiny test in order to be enforceable.\n\nBy passing through the numerous phases of colonial occupation, the relationship between religion and government in the Philippines has repeatedly changed. The country had close ties between the Catholic Church and the government during the Spanish colonial period from 1565 to 1898. The American concept of separation of church and state was introduced during the American colonial period in the Philippine Constitution of 1899 and remains a part of the Philippine constitution today.\n\nBeginning with the Christianization of most of the Philippines in the 16th century, political power was shared by the Catholic Church and the Spanish civil authorities. Horacio de la Costa, a Filipino Jesuit historian, mentions that the rules governing the cooperation of the two entities was set in the “Patronato Real de las Indias”, a combination of law and jurisprudence that governed the delicate relationship of the Holy See and the Spanish monarchy regarding colonial affairs. In the agreements, the Catholic clergy gave the Spanish monarchy the \"responsibility of promoting, maintaining, and defending Catholicsm in... all Spanish dominions overseas\"\n. In return, the Spanish were permitted to exercise numerous rights to autonomously govern the colonial Catholic Church virtually independent of Roman jurisdiction.\nOn the other hand, Teodoro Agoncillo, a Filipino historian from the University of the Philippines, mentions that the collaboration enabled the Spanish to readily subjugate the Indios (natives of the Philippines) by a potent combination of secular and religious might. The successful Legazpi conquest of the Philippines in 1565 recognized the power of clergy by bringing along Augustinian friar, navigator and priest Andrés de Urdaneta, to help control the natives. Other Spanish rulers acknowledged the importance of clergy. A Mexican viceroy (quoted in Agoncillo) said that \"in each friar in the Philippines, they had a captain and a whole army\". However, Church involvement had numerous ill effects, as antifriar Marcelo H. del Pilar of the late 19th century complains: \"... the friars control all the fundamental forces of society in the Philippines. They control the educational system, for they own the University of Santo Tomás, and are the local inspectors of every primary school. They control the minds of the people because in a dominantly Catholic country, the parish rectors can utilize the pulpit and confessionals to publicly or secretly influence the people.\"\n\nIn-fighting continued and reached its peak when the Gomburza, a triad of priests composed of Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, were executed by civil authorities in 1872 after being implicated in the failed Cavite Mutiny in that same year. Popular discontent ensued, leading to the Philippine Revolution some twenty years later. The Spanish were unable to cope with multiple uprisings since their limited military was overextended. Bereft of the civil protection, clerics were at their most vulnerable. Rather than accept change, numerous friars \"handled the Mausers and Remingtons when the tide of battle was going against the colonial government\". As the status quo was being changed, the ties between Church and State began to fall apart.\n\nFilipino nationalists in 1898 framed a constitution for an independent Philippine republic. There were heated discussions on the provision on state and religion. Felipe Calderón presented his draft proposal calling for Catholicism to be made a state religion. According to Jesuit historian John Schumacher, Calderón then attacked the position of Apolinario Mabini who insisted on the separation of church and state. The Calderón proposal, however, was defeated by a single vote, and the provision was finally passed. The constitution of 1899 states in Article 5:\n\nSpain ceded the Philippines to the United States in 1898. By the end of February 1902, American forces had defeated the Philippine forces seeking to establish an independent Philippine republic. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 provided, among other things, \"That no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed.\" \n\nSchumacher cites that William Howard Taft, the head of the Second Philippine Commission and the first civil governor of the Philippine Islands, was very much aware of the need to defuse anti-friar feeling throughout the islands. He requested the Spanish friars be given leave of their parish posts. Many of the friars left voluntarily, and were replaced by native Filipino priests in lower ranks and American bishops in the ranks of the episcopacy. Negotiations also began for the compulsory sale of vast Catholic Church holdings. Although the sale was affected by pressure from influential sectors like some bishops and certain delegates, it achieved Taft’s goal of sequestering all the Catholic Church lands, something that the ill-fated Philippine Republic had failed to achieve. After taking the land, the governor intended to redistribute the land. This not only reduced the financial position of the Catholic Church, but also diminished the influential clout it had during the Spanish colonial period.\n\nAmerican jurisprudence reintroduced separation of church and state relying on the First Amendment and the metaphor of Thomas Jefferson on the \"wall of separation... between church and state\"\n, but the Philippine experience has shown that this theoretical \"wall of separation\" has been crossed several times by secular authorities. Schumacher states that in 1906, the Philippine Supreme Court intervened in the issue of parish ownership by returning assets seized by the Philippine Independent Church, while certain charitable organizations managed or influenced by the Catholic Church were either returned or sequestered.\n\nThe provision of the 1935 charter on religion mimicked the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but the sentences\n\nWith the guarantee of religious freedom in the Philippines, the Catholic clergy subsequently remained in the political background as a source of moral influence for many voters during elections until today. Political candidates generally court the clergy for support, although this does not guarantee victory for a candidate. The Philippines was placed under martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos and relations changed dramatically, as some bishops opposed the martial law.\n\nA new constitution was ratified in 1973 which included the separation of church and state clause, signaling a new development in the body of law on religious affairs. Joaquin Bernas, a Filipino Jesuit specializing in constitutional law, acknowledges that there were complex issues that were brought to court and numerous attempts to use the separation of Church and State against the Catholic Church, but he defends the statement, saying that \"the fact that he [Marcos] tried to do it does not deny the validity of the separation of church and state\".\n\nSharia District Courts (SDCs) and Sharia Circuit Courts (SCCs) were created in 1977 through Presidential Decree 1083, which is also known as the Code of Muslim Personal Laws. Islamic law only applies to civil cases involving all Muslims nationwide. Cases are handled in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and a couple of Mindanao provinces that are not part of ARMM by both sharia district and circuit courts, organised into five sharia districts. Outside these areas, sharia-related cases are processed in civil courts under a session from the five sharia districts. All other cases, including criminal ones, are dealt with by local civil courts.\n\nThe Catholic Church was instrumental in winning support for Corazon Aquino who replaced Marcos as president with Cardinal Sin calling for support. Aquino then initiated a new constitutional commission to frame a new charter again for the country. It is noted that Roman Catholic religious and clergy like Christine Tan, R.G.S., a nun, Joaquin Bernas, S.J., and Bishop Teodoro C. Bacani became part of the 1986 Constitutional Commission and left their mark on the promulgation of the charter and its numerous provisions on the Church and state.\n\nThe CBCP was embroiled in a controversy in 2011 over millions of pesos in donations from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) at the behest of then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. According to a Commission on Audit report in 2009, some bishops received donations for the purchase of vehicles from the PCSO. Critics claim the donations was given to ensure Church support for Arroyo, who was then buffeted by scandals and repeated threats of impeachment. The bishops were summoned during the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation on the anomalies within the PCSO, with the bishops returning the vehicles donated to them. Senator Teofisto Guingona, chairman of the committee, said that since the vehicles were used for secular purposes, the donation is not considered as a violation of the Constitution, but added that the issue was a \"litmus test to the Constitution\" since the Constitution prohibits favoring a particular religious organization.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Szymanowski first visited Zakopane in the Tatras in 1921 and studied the music and folklore of the Gorals people. The score makes extensive use of folk-song and employs a choir with tenor solo.\n\nThe ballet comprises two acts, preceded by a prelude.

It is down the line from . The station is smaller than on the west side of the city.\n\nGreat Western Railway manage the station and operate trains on the routes to , , . South Western Railway run trains between St David's and London Waterloo via Exeter Central.\n\nFrom 1860, when it opened by the London and South Western Railway, until 1933, when it was rebuilt, it was known as Exeter Queen Street.\n\nThe London and South Western Railway (LSWR) opened its Exeter Extension from on 19 July 1860 and its station at Queen Street in the city centre became the terminus for services from London Waterloo station. From 1 May 1861 it was also the terminus for trains on the new Exeter and Exmouth Railway. This was also operated by the LSWR but the physical junction between the two lines was at Exmouth Junction, east of Queen Street.\n\nThe final piece of the LSWR's network in Exeter was opened on 1 February 1862 when a steep line descended from the west end of Queen Street station to reach the Bristol and Exeter Railway's station at which had been opened in 1844. Here the LSWR connected with the Exeter and Crediton Railway and over that line eventually reached Plymouth, Padstow, , and Most trains to these destinations changed locomotives at Queen Street and many had carriages added or removed too. A locomotive shed was situated at the station but it was replaced by a new maintenance depot at Exmouth Junction in 1887. The space was later used for enlarged carriage sidings; further carriage sidings were situated at the west end of the station beyond the Queen Street bridge.\n\nThe original station had just a single platform with two tracks which were covered by a large train shed. A second platform and train shed was added in 1874 and two sidings were laid to give a total of four tracks between the platforms. The LSWR became a part of the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923 and two years later the eastbound platform was lengthened from to , taking it beyond the New North Road bridge at the east end of the station. A fire damaged the original wooden buildings on the westbound platform in 1927 and work on rebuilding the station started in 1931. The train sheds were demolished and new brick buildings were officially opened on 1 July 1933 when the station was renamed 'Exeter Central'. At this time there were four platform tracks – east-facing terminal platforms 1 and 4 and through platforms 2 and 3 – and two additional through lines in the centre of the station.\n\nOn 1 January 1948 the SR was nationalised to become the Southern Region of British Railways but in 1963 the Southern Region lines west of were transferred to the Western Region and by 1967 services from London Waterloo were reduced with very few running beyond Exeter St David's. The entrance at the east end of the station from New North Road was closed in 1966. Goods yards had been provided on the north side of the line, both behind the eastbound platform and also on the other side of the Queen Street bridge. General goods traffic was withdrawn on 4 December 1967 but cement traffic continued until January 1980. The eastbound through line (the 'up through') was taken out of use on 9 November 1969, as was the 'down through' on 13 October 1984.\n\nOn 2 July 1984 the entrance from New North Road was reopened, and later a new ramped footbridge was installed to give direct access from there to the east end of both platforms. Sectorisation in the 1980s saw Exeter Central become the most westerly station managed by Network SouthEast but it was later transferred to Regional Railways sector which operated the services to Exmouth. Privatisation therefore saw it pass to Wales & West and then Wessex Trains.\n\nThe three-track locomotive shed was sited to the east of the station on the south side of the line. The original shed was extended to in 1872 and further modernised facilities were brought into use five years later. Despite these alterations the space was too small to handle all the locomotives working in and out of the station so a new maintenance depot was opened at Exmouth Junction in 1887. A few sidings and the turntable was retained at Queen Street. This turntable was long but in 1888 it was replaced by a example.\n\nIn the 1860s there was just a single track to the East but two tracks to the West; all the points and signals were operated on the ground. The first signal boxes were brought into use in 1875 when three controlled the extensive layout: 'Queen Street A' and 'Queen Street B' at the east end of the station, with 'Queen Street C' situated at the west end between the two platforms. These signal boxes were all closed in the 1920s. The C box was replaced by a new one at the west end of the eastbound platform on 13 September 1925. The A and B boxes were replaced by a new, larger box on the north side of the line beyond the New North Road bridge on 15 November 1927. This was named 'Queen Street A' and the C box was renamed 'Queen Street B'; six years later they were renamed again as 'Exeter Central A' and 'Exeter Central B'.\n\nThe B box was closed on 23 February 1970 and the A box was then renamed just 'Exeter Central'. This too closed on 6 May 1985 when control was transferred to the new panel signal box at St David's. With this change came resignalling; the westbound platform 2 was signalled for trains to run in either direction as was the westbound line to St David's. The signals are interlocked so that trains cannot start from either St David's or Central until their route is clear right through to their platform at the other station; a feature replicated from the days of steam locomotives with less power or brakes than today's diesels when it was undesirable for trains to come to a stand on this steeply graded section of line.\n\nThe station is situated below road level to the east of Queen Street, where the main entrance is situated centrally in the curved brick building erected in 1933 on the south side of the line. The ticket office is placed in the original 1933 booking hall, which leads via a passageway to the covered footbridge that spans the tracks parallel to Queen Street. Lifts are located near the steps down to the platforms, the first of which leads down to platform 2 which is used by all trains towards St David's but can also handle trains in the opposite direction. At platform level the old Queen Street C signal box built in 1925 and taken out of use in 1970 can still be seen standing at the end of platform 3 between the footbridge and Queen Street. Beyond this the line can be seen dropping steeply at 1 in 37 (2.7%) and curving northwards towards the St David's Tunnel. The level areas alongside this line used to be a goods yard (on the right) and carriage sidings (on the left).\n\nThe wide and long platforms – they are long enough to handle 14-coach trains – are covered for most of their length by simple canopies. At the eastern end of platform 2 is the bay platform 1, although this is seldom used nowadays as most trains approaching from this end continue at least as far as St David's. At the far end of the platform a ramp leads up to another footbridge and another entrance, again on the south side of the line, from New North Road.\nTicket barriers were installed in early 2011 both at the main entrance and at the New North Road Entrance.\n\nExeter Central is the second busiest station in Devon, handling around 88,000 fewer passengers than in 2018/19.\n\nComparing the year from April 2007 to that which started in April 2002, passenger numbers increased by 29%.\n\nExeter Central is served by trains on the West of England line operated by South Western Railway from London Waterloo station to . Local services are provided by Great Western Railway on the Avocet Line from to Exeter St David's (where they continue to ) and on the Tarka Line from to .\n\nOn summer Sundays there are also trains to in connection with the Dartmoor Sunday Rover network. Occasionally weekend services to are operated by Great Western Railway when their route to London Paddington station is closed for engineering work.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972258", "title": "Ejectment", "text": "Ejectment\n\nEjectment is a common law term for civil action to recover the possession of or title to land. It replaced the old real actions and the various possessory assizes (denoting county-based pleas to local sittings of the courts) where boundary disputes often featured. Though still used in some places, the term is now obsolete in many common law jurisdictions, in which possession and title are sued by the actions of eviction (also called possession proceedings) and quiet title (or injunctive and/or declaratory relief), respectively.\n\nOriginally, successful ejectment meant recovery of possession of land, for example against a defaulting tenant or a trespasser, who did not have (or no longer had) any right to remain there. It has continued to be used for this, though in some jurisdictions the terminology has changed.\n\nThe old real actions, which were concerned with the title to land, were found to be too technical and difficult to use. A practice developed of trying the title to ownership of land by means of a special ejectment chiefly for ensuring a low court and had the added advantage of some confidentiality among the landed gentry. The claimant granted (or so professed) a lease to a friend which had passed to a fictitious person (such as John Doe), who became the nominal plaintiff: the real claimant (plaintiff) was thereby the \"lessor of the plaintiff\". The action was vicarious. The action was brought against the real defendant or, more usually, for semi-secrecy and to ensure the low court, against another fictitious person (e.g. William Styles), in many papers termed the \"casual ejector\", who both sides' papers would state evicted the first fictitious tenant(s) by virtue of an (equally fictitious) lease granted by the real defendant. The title of the action would then be \"Doe dem. [name of real claimant] v. [Defendant] or [fictitous counter-tenant]\". E.g. \"Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. & Ald. 544\" (England; 1822),\n\nA letter was sent in the name of the casual ejector to the real defendant, inviting him to defend the case on behalf of his supposed tenant. The defendant's right to appear depended on the existence of the fictitious lease (an existence he would willingly assert). This enabled the rights of the real parties to be litigated in a low court. Such fictitious actions have been abolished in many jurisdictions as a result of the provision of alternative remedies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1972259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972259", "title": "Dead Rising (video game)", "text": "Dead Rising (video game)\n\nOriginally released for the Xbox 360 video game console on August 8, 2006, the game became a commercial success, leading it to being introduced as part of the Xbox 360 \"Platinum Hits\" lineup, while also spawning three sequels - \"Dead Rising 2\" in September 2010, \"Dead Rising 3\" in November 2013, and \"Dead Rising 4\" in December 2016. A remake of the game was made for the Wii, entitled \"\", and released in February 2009, with a mobile phone version also created. As part of its tenth anniversary, the game was re-released on September 13, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.\n\nPlayers can operate the game in one of two modes. 72 Hour Mode is the main mode and the only one available to players to begin with, in which the main objective is to investigate the Willamette Parkview Mall within 3 days, before Frank can be rescued by helicopter, completing a series of \"Case Files\" - major missions that, when completed, advance the game's main story. If the player fails a Case File, the game does not end, allowing the player to merely explore the mall instead until the mode is up, though failure to comply to certain conditions (primarily associated with Case Files) will result in then earning a different ending. Completing all the Case Files by the time 72 Hour Mode is over, will unlock \"Overtime Mode\" which players automatically begin, where the main objective to complete has Frank given one more day to complete an additional set of objectives within the mall. The second mode, ∞ (Infinity) Mode, is unlocked after completing Overtime Mode and allows players to roam around the mall in sandbox mode without any time limit, with Frank merely trying to survive as long as possible.\n\nTo survive in all modes, players need to find and seek out weapons scattered around the mall that they can use against the zombies. Over 250 items are available to use in combat; they can be found anywhere, such as in stores, and fall under two categories, melee and ranged, with all ranging from the powerful, to the near-useless. The weapons and other items are firearms, sports equipment, children's toys, furniture, construction tools, electronic devices, and various bladed objects. Frank can carry only a limited number of weapons - baseball bats, 2x4 planks, hammers, pistols, shotguns, and so forth, though he can carry multiple versions of the same type. Also, he can use them only a limited number of times before he must find new ones, as melee weapons eventually deteriorate and break, while guns must be discarded when out of ammunition. Some weapons can be changed by the environment - frying pans can be heated on a stove both to increase damage and grant access to a special move - while others are large objects that Frank cannot store in his inventory and which he will drop if he picks up or switches to another item. Many of the less useful weapons exist purely for humorous effect. For example, the toy Megabuster, from Capcom's Mega Man, shoots tennis balls; traffic cones are simply put over a zombie's head, causing it to stumble about blindly.\n\nItems other than weapons are available. Frank can try out various outfits from the mall's clothing stores - such as a Special Forces uniform, wrestling boots, a hockey mask and Mega Man X's armor. He can carry around certain books that can confer bonuses, such as increasing the durability of weapons. He can consume food and drink scavenged while exploring to recover health, or blend them together to make different \"juices\", which have temporary effects on the player. In Infinity Mode, players need to eat food to stay alive, as Frank's health drops every 100 seconds. They cannot access the supermarket within the mall, and food items are limited, but they can acquire weapons and food items from all characters; survivors are hostile to them in this mode.\n\n\"Dead Rising\" incorporates an element of RPGs in the form of an experience system, in which completing various actions will reward Frank with \"Prestige Points\" (PP). While in both modes, killing large number of zombies can earn PP, so too can taking photographs. Any photograph that Frank takes in the game is automatically scored based on five \"genres\" - horror (zombies and graphic gore), outtakes (humorous events or scenes), erotica (photos of female survivors or zombies, particularly those focusing on the breasts and crotch), drama (dramatic events, such as the survivors' reactions while in the security room), or brutality (deaths of zombies and other characters) - with the score converted into PP. In addition to these actions, both 72 Hour Mode and Overtime Mode award PP for completing Case Files, and completing the optional task of rescuing survivors within the mall, and defeating \"psychopaths\" - boss characters who have either been driven insane by the zombie attacks, or are using the outbreak as cover for their own purposes. Once enough PP is earned, Frank will level up, resulting in upgrades to either attack power, running speed, throw distance, health, or to the number of items Frank can carry in his inventory, while new moves can also be unlocked, which boost his effectiveness with hand-to-hand combat. Any experience, levels, and unlocked moves earned in a playthrough will automatically be carried over into a new game should the player choose to restart, which can make subsequent playthroughs much easier.\n\nAn in-game HUD is provided, which displays information on Frank's health, his prestige level and the amount of PP progress he has made towards the next one, his inventory of weapons and their condition/amount of ammo left, a counter for the number of zombies the player has killed during a playthrough, and objective counters for both major and optional tasks, which consists of a bar that counts down the amount of time a player has to reach where the objective is located within the mall and complete it, before it is considered to be failed. Players also have access to a map to help them make their way around the mall and pinpoint where they must go in the main game mode, can receive calls on a transceiver about anything suspicious that Frank can investigate (he cannot jump, attack, switch weapons, or pick up/use any item when taking a call), and can view Frank's watch to determine what time it is; in-game time progresses faster than real time, with a day in the game taking two hours of real time, while the time of day also affects the behaviour of the zombies - during the day, they are sluggish and weak, but become more active, tougher, and more numerous at night. Players may save by using green couches or the mall's various restrooms, though the original Xbox 360 version allows only one game-in-progress save to be made per memory device and player profile; the save system is disabled for Infinity Mode. When Frank is killed, the player may reload from the last save or restart from the beginning.\n\nPhotojournalist Frank West is alerted by a source that something is happening in the town of Willamette, Colorado. Flying into the town with helicopter pilot Ed DeLuca, he learns that the town is subject to a military quarantine and observes several violent incidents throughout the town. He is dropped onto the Willamette Parkview Mall's helipad, after asking Ed to return in three days. Arriving in the mall, he learns that the quarantine is due to an outbreak of zombies. The mall is breached, forcing Frank to take refuge in the mall's security room. With the help of janitor Otis Washington, he travels into the mall. After helping D.H.S. agent Brad Garrison in a firefight against an unknown assailant, the two strike an alliance. Person of interest to Brad, Russell Barnaby is located by the two, hidden in a bookstore. Barnaby refuses to be escorted to safety, forcing the two to return to the security room. Unable to call for assistance due to a communications jammer, the two rescue Barnaby from the unknown assailant. Brad is injured, forcing Frank to search for medicine. \n\nIn his search, he comes across a woman he met during the mall's breach. The woman rebukes him, mentioning Santa Cabeza. Frank learns from Barnaby that Santa Cabeza was ostensibly a Central American town linked to the drug trade; which distributed drugs that had a zombifying effect. Locating the woman again on security monitors, he questions her. Revealing herself to be Isabela Keyes, sister of the unknown assailant, Carlito, she promises to set up an interview between the two. Isabela comes to the meeting alone, after being shot in a rage by Carlito. Frank escorts Isabela to the security room, where she reveals that Santa Cabeza was home to an American research facility experimenting on cattle, and that Barnaby was its head. Isabela, as a research assistant, was privy to the fact that a species of native wasp was used in an attempt to boost the performance of cattle, but instead had a zombifying effect. The wasps escaped and affected humans, forcing a U.S. military cleanup of all life in the town, with few escapees. Barnaby begins to zombify and attacks Brad's partner, Jesse McCarney, and is killed. \n\nIsabela reveals that Carlito is planning to use the mall as a staging point to spread the parasites across the country, using bombs located in trucks. Brad and Frank disable the bombs. Brad and Carlito engage in a firefight, and Carlito is mortally wounded. Brad is mauled by zombies however, asking Frank to euthanize him. Frank locates Carlito and receives his locket, before Carlito dies. The locket causes Isabela to realise the password of Carlito's computer, allowing her to shut down the jammer. However, U.S. Special Forces arrive in the mall regardless, and have cleanup orders. Jesse is allowed to live, but she zombifies. Otis escapes with a helicopter and possible survivors that Frank rescued. Frank returns to the helipad alone, and DeLuca's helicopter arrives, but crashes into the mall's clock tower. \n\nIsabela arrives, but Frank passes out. Isabela realises that Frank has been infected by the wasp larval parasite. Frank gathers supplies for a drug that can suppress the parasite, and discovers an exit from the mall created by DeLuca's crash. Isabela learns from Carlito's computer that he has manufactured the drug before, and used it on fifty infected orphans, spreading them across the country. After exiting the mall, Frank encounters the cleanup operation's commander, Brock Mason, who also commanded Santa Cabeza's operation. The two fight, until Mason is knocked into a crowd of zombies. \n\nFrank and Isabela escape from Willamette, but Isabela is taken into custody as a perpetrator of the incident. Frank manages to report on the incident and Santa Cabeza, but the truth of Carlito's orphans remain unknown. \n\nAlthough completing all Case Files and Overtime Mode leads to the game's canonical ending, in terms of the game's lore, the player may encounter different endings in \"Dead Rising\", depending on certain actions that they perform, as listed below:\n\n\nMuch of the game's inspiration came from the zombie films of the 1960s and 1970s, especially those of George A. Romero. Despite the game's similarities to Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead\", Capcom asserted that the concept of \"humans battling zombies in a shopping mall\" is a \"wholly unprotectible idea\" under the present copyright laws. While the company wanted to have the game follow on from its other zombie-centered game series, its development team opted to design the game with a more comical view of zombies in the horror genre, particularly in the way that players interacted with the zombies in the game, allowing them to be able to do anything against them in terms of what weapons they could use against them, while they also based the mall upon the stereotypical design of American shopping malls. One particular area that was keenly worked on by the team was the number of zombies that could appear onscreen during the game in order to give the feel that it was a major outbreak; when \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" reviewed the game, they reported that up to 800 zombies could appear on screen at once. As the development team consisted of members who had worked on Capcom's role-playing video game \"\", it helped greatly in incorporating one of the game's elements borrowed from it, towards the developing the mechanics structure of \"Dead Rising\" - the ability to roll over anything earned in terms of experience, levels and abilities, towards making a new playthrough, was implemented so that players would have a sense of responsibility for their decisions and actions.\n\nAfter making changes to the beta of the game, a playable demo was released via the Xbox Live Marketplace on August 4, 2006, prior to its release over the next two months.\n\n\"Dead Rising Original Soundtrack\" was released in Japan on March 30, 2007 in a 2,000-copy limited edition, bundled with a T-shirt. It was packaged with a T-shirt that showcased Frank, Isabella, and an outline of the mall. A non-limited edition of the same soundtrack was released on June 20, 2007.\n\nSoon after \"Dead Rising\" was released in the United States, Capcom released nine downloadable \"keys\" to Xbox Live Marketplace that would unlock different lockers in the Security Room, providing the player with nine new outfit options, adding three more keys for players to download and use on May 31, 2007.\n\n\"Dead Rising\" received \"generally positive\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic, with most reviewers commending the \"sandbox\"-style of gameplay, the amount to explore within the mall, and the sheer number of ways to kill the thousands of zombies, with GameSpot stating it was \"a great piece of entertainment\", while two reviewers on Australian video game talk show \"Good Game\" gave the title a 6-7/10 score. However, general consensus amongst reviews was towards criticising the game's save system mechanic and the AI of the survivors; while IGN considered the game to be \"one of the more unique and entertaining titles on the Xbox 360\", its review notably indicated that improvements were needed with both the save system and NPCs, along with offering \"a more forgiving story progression, and tighter controls\". One point of contention in reviews was the operation of the game's transceiver, specifically on how persistent it is when ringing, how vulnerable Frank is while answering any calls on it, and how if the telephone call is somehow interrupted (such as being attacked), it would end abruptly and be repeated again when the player answers the transceiver a few seconds later and hears Frank being scolded by Otis for being rude; the use of the transceiver in the game led to numerous gamer-oriented webcomics and blogs parodying the use of it. Despite this, Capcom reported around 500,000 copies had been shipped out in the first month after its release, and one million copies worldwide by the end of 2006. It received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nOne notable complaint that \"Dead Rising\" received, was from players who ran the game through either a standard-definition or small high-definition set, only to find themselves having difficulty reading the on-screen text, an issue caused due to Capcom deciding to develop the game exclusively for high-definition televisions, particularly as it had been touted as one of the first truly \"next generation\" titles available for the Xbox 360. In response to the complaints about the issue, a representative of the company posted the following on Xbox.com:\n\nA week later, Capcom released a statement saying they would not be fixing the problem, and suggested some DIY solutions to resolve the issue.\n\nAlong with being ranked #2 in gaming magazine Gamesmaster's Top 50 of 2006, \"Dead Rising\" won several awards:\n\n\nBecause of the graphical nature of the violence portrayed in \"Dead Rising\", the BPjM in Germany felt that game fulfilled at least one of their indexing criteria, documenting that the title glorified violence. As a direct result, the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle, the board responsible for rating entertainment software for Germany, refused to rate the game, and effectively put a halt to Microsoft publishing a German version, as the company does not allow unrated games to be released for the Xbox 360, though the game was made available for import to players of a legal age. However, after a decision by Hamburg's county court in June 2007, it was prohibited within the country from late August 2007, making sales of the title illegal in Germany; anyone caught selling the game would be sentenced to imprisonment or a monetary penalty according to §131 of the German criminal code, with all copies confiscated by the German police.\n\nThe MKR Group, who holds the copyright to both the 1978 \"Dawn of the Dead\" film and its 2004 remake, sent letters on February 6, 2008 to Capcom, Microsoft, and Best Buy, claiming that \"Dead Rising\" infringes on the copyrights and trademarks of these films. In a complaint filed February 12, 2008, to seek an injunction that would pre-emptively counter an anticipated complaint from MKR, Capcom asserted that \"humans battling zombies in a shopping mall\" is a \"wholly unprotectable idea\" under today's copyright laws; Capcom further pointed to the warning \"label\" on the box cover as a preemptive measure that was intended to separate the game from the films and avoid any customer confusion.<ref name=\"Joystiq-02/14/08\"></ref> The MKR Group subsequently filed a lawsuit in February 2008 after failing to reach an agreement with Capcom over the dispute.\n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed in October 2008, with United States Magistrate Judge Richard G. Seeborg stating that MKR failed to demonstrate the similarity of any protected element of \"Dawn of the Dead\" to that of \"Dead Rising\", with many of the elements MKR claimed were similar being part of the \"wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak\".\n\nA remake of \"Dead Rising\" was released for the Wii in February 2009, titled \"Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop\", and was developed by Capcom and published by THQ in Australia. Built upon the same engine used for the Wii version of \"Resident Evil 4\", which had been positively received by reviewers, the remake incorporated additional features to that of the Xbox 360 original, including the use of an over-the-shoulder camera approach and utilising the motion control system of the Wii Remote, yet lacked some of the features of the original, including showing large number of zombies on screen and the photography system. The Wii version ultimately earned mixed reviews, though was praised for having an improved aiming system to that of the original.\n\nIn 2008, Capcom Interactive Canada released a hand-held spin-off of the game for mobile phone, announcing on 4 October 2010 that an iOS version of the game was also announced. In this version, players have access to a new game mechanic in which they can call upon their friends via Twitter and Facebook to help revive them, with their refusal causing them to appear as a zombie within their friend's game, while complex operations in the game are performed through context-based buttons. Similar to Infinity Mode in the console version, the game features a hunger meter, with Frank now required to eat food within the mall in order to survive. The hand-held spin-off was generally well received by reviewers, earning a B+ from 1UP.com, and a 7.3/10 from IGN, with praise given for staying true to the sandbox design and plot of the Xbox 360 version, despite being pared down for the smaller screen and platform.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, Capcom announced that work was underway for a remastered version of the original \"Dead Rising\", alongside its sequel \"Dead Rising 2\" and its spin-off title, aiming for these to be released for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, prior to the release of the fourth game in the series. These were released on 13 September that year, both separately and in a bundle pack, with the developers improving the game's graphics to high-definition and increasing the number of save slots and the improving the frame-rate.\n\nFollowing the game's commercial success, plans were made to create a sequel, with it aimed to operate on multiple platforms. On 28 September 2010, \"Dead Rising 2\" was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows, and while it followed the basic setup of gameplay mechanics as the original, it featured a new character, a currency system, a weapon creation system that involved finding \"Combo Cards\" to know what to make, and online multiplayer modes, including zombie-killing minigames and two-player cooperative play, whilst also featuring improvements to address some of the negative feedback that \"Dead Rising\" received. Since its release, two downloadable episodes were released for the game - one a prologue set before the main story of \"Dead Rising 2\", the other taking place after it and featuring Frank West, who is also controllable in it - and a re-imagined version was released in October 2011, with a new story and Frank West being the main protagonist.\n\nThe game eventually spawned two more sequels, developed by Capcom's Canadian branch, Capcom Vancouver - \"Dead Rising 3\" was released on 22 November 2013 for Xbox One and on 5 September 2014 for Microsoft Windows, while \"Dead Rising 4\" was released on 6 December 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "1972278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972278", "title": "Billericay Town F.C.", "text": "Billericay Town F.C.\n\nBillericay Town Football Club is a football club based in Billericay, Essex, England. The club are currently members of and play at New Lodge. They are the second most successful club in FA Vase history, having won the competition on three occasions.\n\nThe club was established as Billericay Football Club in 1880. They joined the Romford & District League in 1890, where the club played until World War I. They also started playing in the Mid-Essex League, winning Division Two in 1912–13, 1931–32 and 1932–33. The club remained in the Mid-Essex League until joining the Southern Essex Combination League in 1947. In 1946 they adopted their current name. In 1966 the club were founder members of the Essex Olympian League. The 1969–70 season saw them win the league and League Cup double, a feat they repeated the following season. Following their back-to-back titles, the club became founder members of the Essex Senior League in 1971, finishing as runners-up in its first season and winning the title in 1972–73.\n\nAfter finishing as runners-up again, Billericay won back-to-back league titles in 1974–75 and 1975–76. The latter season also saw them reach the final of the FA Vase and beat Stamford 1–0 at Wembley, as well as a first Essex Senior Cup title when they beat Epping Town 3–2 in the final. Although they only finished third in 1976–77, they retained the FA Vase, beating Sheffield 2–1 in a replay at the City Ground in Nottingham after a 1–1 draw at Wembley. In 1977 the club switched to the Athenian League, which they won at the first attempt. The 1978–79 season saw them retain their Athenian League title and win a third FA Vase in four seasons, beating Almondsbury Greenway 4–1 in the final, with Doug Young becoming the only player to score a hat-trick in an FA Vase final at the old Wembley. The following season saw them move up to Division Two of the Isthmian League, which they also won at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One.\n\nBillericay's success continued in 1980–81 as they finished as runners-up in Division One and were promoted to the Premier Division, the first time back-to-back promotions had been achieved in the league by a new club. The club remained in the Premier Division until being relegated to Division One at the end of the 1985–86 season. This began a spell as a yo-yo club, as they were relegated to Division Two North at the end of the 1988–89 season. The club were placed in Division Two in 1991 after league restructuring, before being promoted back to Division One in 1992–93 and then to the Premier Division in 1997–98 after finishing as Division One runners-up. The 1997–98 season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 3–2 at home to fellow non-League club Wisbech Town.\n\nIn 2004–05 Billericay reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 1–0 at home to Stevenage Borough. They also finished as Premier Division runners-up, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, the club were beaten 2–0 at home by Leyton in the semi-finals. A fourth-place finish in 2006–07 saw them qualify for the play-offs again, this time beating local rivals Chelmsford City 5–3 on penalties in the semi-finals after a 1–1 draw, before losing 4–2 on penalties to Bromley in the final following another 1–1 draw. In 2007–08 they qualified for the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2–1 at home to Swansea City.\n\nIn 2010–11 Billericay won the Essex Senior Cup for a second time, beating Aveley 2–0 in the final. The following season saw the club win the Premier Division, earning promotion to the Conference South. However, they were relegated back to the Isthmian League the following season after finishing second-from-bottom of the Conference South. In December 2016 the club was taken over by Glenn Tamplin, who funded several high-profile signings including Jamie O'Hara, Jermaine Pennant and Paul Konchesky. They won the Isthmian League Cup in 2016–17, beating Tonbridge Angels 8–3 in the final. The club reached the first round of the FA Cup for a fourth time in 2017–18, drawing 1–1 at Leatherhead in the first match and losing the replay 3–1. The season also saw them retain the League Cup, beating Metropolitan Police 5–3 in the final, as well as winning the Premier Division title, earning promotion to the National League South. Tamplin announced that he was leaving the club in September 2019.\n\nAnother FA Cup first round appearance in 2018–19 saw Billericay lose 3–1 at home to Chesterfield in a replay.\n\nArcher Hall became the club's permanent home ground during the 1930s, although it remained an unenclosed pitch. In 1970 the club moved to New Lodge, which had previously been a sports ground used by Outwell Common Football Club. The ground was enclosed using a loan from Basildon Borough Council and Charrington Brewery and dressing rooms and a clubhouse were built. During the 1970s a covered standing area was built on the clubhouse side of the pitch, which became known as the Cowshed. Temporary seated stands loaned from Essex County Cricket Club were later installed on the other side of the pitch. In 1977 the club won a set of floodlights by winning the Philips Electrical Floodlight Competition final against Friar Lane Old Boys, a six-a-side tournament played at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre the day after their FA Vase final against Sheffield. The floodlights were inaugurated with a friendly match against West Ham United, which attracted a then-record crowd of 3,841.\n\nIn 1980 a permanent 120-seat stand was built between the Cowshed and the clubhouse; its shape led to it becoming known as the Pacman stand. During the 1980s a 200-seat stand was built on the side that had previously hosted the temporary seating, with the supporters club erecting several small areas of terracing. In 1995 Billericay bought two stands that had been in use at Newbury Town's Faraday Road ground after the club went bust. One was installed next to the Cowshed and the other at the Blunts Wall End, with seats later installed in the Blunts Wall End stand. The new stand adjacent to the Cowshed was soon moved to the other end of the pitch. An area of covered terracing was added alongside the 200-seat stand. Chelmsford City groundshared at New Lodge between 1998 and 2005. In 2002 the club announced plans to move to a new 4,000-capacity stadium at Gloucester Park. However, the relocation was scrapped by new chairman Steve Kent in 2004. By the summer of 2017 the ground had a capacity of 3,500, of which 424 was seated and 2,000 was covered.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 New Lodge was completely redeveloped. Covered terraces were built at both ends of the ground covering the full width of the pitch; a new seated stand was built next to the clubhouse where the Pacman stand and Cowshed had previously been located, and was named the Harry Parker Stand. On the other side of the pitch the seating was extended to the full length of the pitch. The ground's capacity was raised to around 5,000 with 2,000 seated. A friendly match against West Ham on 8 August 2017 attracted a record crowd of 4,582.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He can be considered part of the Venetian school, though he was also influenced by Antonello da Messina, in the emphasis he gives to landscape backgrounds and the tranquil atmosphere of his works. Once formed his style did not change greatly. He mostly painted religious subjects, often on a small scale for homes rather than churches, but also a few, mostly small, mythological ones. \n\nHe often repeated popular subjects in different versions with slight variations, including his Madonnas and \"Saint Jerome in a Landscape\". His paintings of the \"Madonna and Child\" include several variations of a composition that have a standing infant Jesus, which in turn are repeated several times. \n\nGiovanni Battista Cima was born at Conegliano, then part of the terrafirma of the Republic of Venice but now part of the province of Treviso, in 1459 or 1460. His father, who died in 1484, was a cloth-shearer (\"cimator\"), hence the family surname. \n\nIn 1488 the young painter was at work at Vicenza; in 1492 he established himself at Venice, but by the summer of 1516 he had returned to his native place. Cima married twice, his first wife, Corona, bore him two sons, the older of whom took Holy orders at Padua. By Joanna, his second wife, he had six children, three being daughters. \n\nHis oldest painting inscribed with a date is the \"Madonna of the Arbour\" (1489; now in Museum of Vicenza). This picture is done in distemper and savours so much of the style of Bartolomeo Montagna, who lived at Vicenza from 1480, as to make it highly probable that Cima was his pupil. Even in this early production Cima gave evidence of the serious calm, and almost passionless spirit that so eminently characterized him. Later he fell under the influence of Giovanni Bellini and became one of his ablest successors, forming a happy, if not indispensable link between this master and Titian.\n\nAccording to the 1913 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\":\nAt first his figures were somewhat crude, but they gradually lost their harshness and gained in grace while still preserving the dignity. In the background of his facile, harmonious compositions the mountains of his country are invested with new importance. Cima was one of the first Italians to assign a place for landscape depiction, and to formulate the laws of atmosphere and of the distribution of light and shade. His \"Baptism of Christ\" in the church of San Giovanni in Bragora, in Venice (1492), gives striking evidence of this. The colouring is rich and right with a certain silvery tone peculiar to Cima, but which in his later works merges into a delicate gold. His conceptions are usually calm and undramatic, and he has painted scarcely any scenes (having depicted religious ones almost exclusively) that are not suggestive of \"sante conversazioni\". His \"Incredulity of St. Thomas\" (National Gallery, London) and his beautiful \"Nativity\" (Venice, Santa Maria dei Carmini, 1509) are hardly aught else. But most of his paintings represent Madonnas enthroned among the elect, and in these subjects he observes a gently animated symmetry. The groupings of these sainted figures, even though they may not have a definitely pious character, and the impression of unspeakable peace.\n\nAmong his pupils were his son, Carlo da Conegliano, and Vittore Belliniano. It is unclear if Francesco Beccaruzzi, who was born in Conegliano in 1492, received direct training from Cima.\n\n\n"}

The family made their fortune in selling textiles to the Confederate government, and his father was the founder of the New York Cotton Exchange.\n\nHe studied at Groton and at Harvard, graduating in 1898, and Harvard Law School in 1901. In 1901, he was admitted to the bar.\n\nFor the next two years Woodward lived in London, UK where he served as secretary to the United States ambassador to Britain, Joseph Choate. There, he joined with other members of the political and economic elite including King Edward VII, at fashionable events including thoroughbred horse races, the favorite pastime of English royalty and nobility.\n\nUpon his return to New York in 1903, Woodward was made vice president of Hanover National Bank in New York City by his uncle, James T. Woodward, who was then president of the bank. William Woodward Sr.'s father had helped James purchase a large portion of the bank years earlier before his death.\n\nIn 1903, William Woodward met Elsie Ogden Cryder at Saratoga, New York, and they were married at Grace Church in New York on October 24, 1904. They had a son, William Woodward Jr., and four daughters.\n\nFollowing his uncle's death, William Woodward Sr. became president of the bank in 1910, serving in that capacity until a 1929 merger when he was appointed chairman of the new corporate entity called Central Hanover Bank & Trust. William Woodward inherited a controlling interest in Hanover National Bank plus the historic Belair Mansion and Stud in Collington, Maryland.\n\nBelair is a very historic estate where Colonial Governor of Maryland Samuel Ogle had brought the first Thoroughbred horses imported to America from England in 1747. James T. Woodward acquired it in 1898 for an undisclosed sum of money. William Woodward built the Belair Stud into one of the dominant breeding and thoroughbred horse racing operations in the United States during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 1925, Woodward joined Arthur B. Hancock, Marshall Field III and Robert A. Fairburn to import the stallion Sir Gallahad III into the United States to stand at Claiborne Farm. Sir Gallahad III would become a four-time leading sire in North America and would sire 60 stakes winners, including nine for Woodward. Sir Gallahad III's most famous offspring was Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox, who would in turn sire Triple Crown winner Omaha, both bred and raced by Woodward.\n\nHorses bred by Belair won every major stakes race in the U.S. as well as The Oaks, St. Leger Stakes, 1,000 Guineas, and other important races in Britain. Woodward's accomplishments in horse racing led to him making the August 7, 1939 cover of Time magazine.\n\nWoodward was elected to the United States Jockey Club in 1917 and served as its chairman from 1930 until 1950. One of the main efforts he pursued was the repeal of the Jersey Act, a regulation of the British Thoroughbred stud book that prevented most American-bred Thoroughbreds from being registered in the United Kingdom as purebred Thoroughbreds.\n\nIn 1950, Woodward was elected an honorary member of the British Jockey Club.\n\nHe died in 1953, aged 77, leaving the estate to his son, William Woodward Jr., whose untimely death two years later in 1955 saw the end of Belair Stud.\n\nToday the Belair Stable Museum in Bowie, Maryland, highlights the work of William Woodward Sr. and others connected to the Belair Stud.\n\nThe Woodward Stakes, a Grade I event now run at Saratoga, is named in his honor.\n\nIn 2016, Woodward was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame as a Pillar of the Turf.\n\n"}
{"id": "1972288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972288", "title": "De architectura", "text": "De architectura\n\n' (On architecture, published as Ten Books on Architecture\"\"') is a treatise on architecture written by the Roman architect and military engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio and dedicated to his patron, the emperor Caesar Augustus, as a guide for building projects. As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture. It contains a variety of information on Greek and Roman buildings, as well as prescriptions for the planning and design of military camps, cities, and structures both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments). Since Vitruvius published before the development of cross vaulting, domes, concrete, and other innovations associated with Imperial Roman architecture, his ten books are not regarded as a source of information on these hallmarks of Roman building design and technology.\n\nProbably written between 30 and 15 BC, it combines the knowledge and views of many antique writers, both Greek and Roman, not only on architecture but on the arts, natural history and building technology. Vitruvius cites many authorities throughout the text, often praising Greek architects for their development of temple building and the orders (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), and providing key accounts of the origins of building in the primitive hut.\n\nThough often cited for his famous \"triad\" of characteristics associated with architecture—utilitas, firmitas and venustas (utility, strength and beauty)—the aesthetic principles that influenced later treatise writers were outlined in Book III. Derived partially from Latin rhetoric (through Cicero and Varro), Vitruvian terms for order, arrangement, proportion, and fitness for intended purposes have guided architects for centuries, and continue to do so today. The Roman author also gave advice on the qualifications of an architect (Book I) and on types of architectural drawing.\n\nThe ten books or scrolls are organized as follows:\n\n\"De architectura\" – \"\"\n\nRoman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in \"De architectura\". He covered a wide variety of subjects he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects that may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings.\n\nVitruvius, thus, deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book of \"De architectura\", he advises architects working with bricks to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book relates the abstract geometry of Plato to the everyday work of the surveyor. Astrology is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while astronomy is required for the understanding of sundials. Likewise, Vitruvius cites Ctesibius of Alexandria and Archimedes for their inventions, Aristoxenus (Aristotle's apprentice) for music, Agatharchus for theatre, and Varro for architecture.\n\nVitruvius sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the artist's work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from \"De architectura\" is one still quoted by architects: \"Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight.\" This quote is taken from Sir Henry Wotton's version of 1624, and is a plain and accurate translation of the passage in Vitruvius (I.iii.2): but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word \"commodity\", and the tag is usually misunderstood. A modern interpretation of Wotton's English might render it thus: \"The ideal building has three elements; it is sturdy, useful, and beautiful.\"\n\nVitruvius also studied human proportions (Book ) and his \"canones\" were later encoded in a very famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci (\"Homo Vitruvianus\", \"Vitruvian Man\").\n\nWhile Vitruvius is fulsome in his descriptions of religious buildings, infrastructure and machinery, he communicates a mixed message on the issue domestic architecture. Similar to Aristotle, Vitruvius offers admiration for householders who built their own homes without the involvement of an architect. Vitruvius’ ambivalence on domestic architecture is most clearly read in the opening paragraph of the Introduction to Book 6. Book 6 focusses exclusively on residential architecture but as architectural theorist Simon Weir has explained, instead of writing the introduction on the virtues of residences or the family or some theme related directly to domestic life; Vitruvius writes an anecdote about the Greek ethical principle of Xenia: showing kindness to strangers. \n\n\"De architectura\" is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures, such as hoists, cranes, and pulleys, as well as war machines such as catapults, ballistae, and siege engines. Vitruvius also described the construction of sundials and water clocks, and the use of an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).\n\nBooks , , and of \"De architectura\" form the basis of much of what is known about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the Pont du Gard in southern France. Numerous such massive structures occur across the former empire, a testament to the power of Roman engineering. Vitruvius' description of Roman aqueduct construction is short, but mentions key details especially for the way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed.\n\nHis book would have been of assistance to Frontinus, a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome. Frontinus wrote \"De aquaeductu\", the definitive treatise on 1st-century Roman aqueducts, and discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. The Roman Empire went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no fewer than 16 water mills at Barbegal in France demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known, such as the much later Hierapolis sawmill.\n\nVitruvius described many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as stucco painting. Cement, concrete, and lime received in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design.\n\nVitruvius advised that lead should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred. He comes to this conclusion in Book of \"De architectura\" after empirical observation of the apparent laborer illnesses in the plumbum foundries of his time. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, and coated the inner surfaces of the pipes, so lead poisoning was unlikely.\n\nVitruvius related the famous story about Archimedes and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realized the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of \"\"Eureka!\"\", and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure gold. He showed the crown had been alloyed with silver, and the king was defrauded.\n\nVitruvius described the construction of the Archimedes' screw in Chapter 10, although did not mention Archimedes by name. It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines mentioned in \"De architectura\" include the endless chain of buckets and the reverse overshot water-wheel. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at Rio Tinto in Spain and Dolaucothi in west Wales. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the British Museum, and one from the latter in the National Museum of Wales. The remains were discovered when these mines were reopened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as water wheels to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, fulling, and so on.\n\nCtesibius is credited with the invention of the force pump, which Vitruvius described as being built from bronze with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by Hero of Alexandria in his \"Pneumatica\". The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentioned its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire engine. One was found at Roman Silchester or Calleva Atrebatum in England, and another is on display at the British Museum. Their functions are not described, but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specified.\n\nVitruvius also mentioned the several automatons Ctesibius invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function.\n\nVitruvius described the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the hypocaust, a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so fuel efficiency is maximized; for example, the \"caldarium\" is next to the \"tepidarium\" followed by the \"frigidarium\". He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger \"thermae\", such as the Baths of Diocletian and the Baths of Caracalla.\n\nThat Vitruvius must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or \"chorobates\", which he compared favourably with the \"groma\", a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He described the \"hodometer\", in essence a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the Peutinger Table.\n\nIn Book Chapter 1 Subsection 4 of \"De architectura\" is a description of 13 Athenian cities in Asia Minor, \"the land of Caria\", in present-day Turkey. These cities are given as: Ephesus, Miletus, Myus, Priene, Samos, Teos, Colophon, Chius, Erythrae, Phocaea, Clazomenae, Lebedos, Mytilene, and later a 14th, Smyrnaeans. Myus, the third city, is described as being \"long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage\". This sentence indicates, at the time of Vitruvius's writing, it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from south to north so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case, then since the writing of \"De architectura\", the region has experienced either soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, or speculation of such, during the later-empire many Roman ports suffered from what contemporary writers described as 'silting'. The constant need to dredge ports became a heavy burden on the treasury and some have speculated that this expense significantly contributed to the eventual collapse of the empire. Roman salt works in Essex, England, today are located at the five-metre contour, implying this was the coastline. These observations only indicate the extent of silting and soil rebound affecting coastline change since the writing of \"De architectura\".\n\nVitruvius' work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace \"scriptorium\" of Charlemagne in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical manuscripts is part of what is called the Carolingian Renaissance.) Many of the surviving manuscripts of Vitruvius' work derive from an existing manuscript that was written there, British Library manuscript Harley 2767.\n\nThese texts were not just copied, but also known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, bishop Einhard, asked the visiting English churchman Alcuin for explanations of some technical terms. In addition, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, including: Vussin, Hrabanus Maurus, Hermann of Reichenau, Hugo of St. Victor, Gervase of Melkey, William of Malmesbury, Theoderich of St. Trond, Petrus Diaconus, Albertus Magnus, Filippo Villani, Jean de Montreuil, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Giovanni de Dondi, Domenico di Bandino, Niccolò Acciaioli bequeathed copy to the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, Bernward of Hildesheim, and St. Thomas Aquinas. In 1244 the Dominican friar Vincent of Beauvais made a large number of references to \"De architectura\" in his compendium of all the knowledge of the Middle Ages \"\"Speculum maius\"\".\n\nMany copies of \"De architectura\", dating from the 8th to the 15th centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the Middle Ages and 92 are still available in public collections, but they appear to have received little attention, possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius and the loss of most of the original 10 illustrations thought by some to be helpful in understanding parts of the text.\n\nVitruvius' work was \"rediscovered\" in 1414 by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini, who found it in the Abbey of St Gallen, Switzerland. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of Renaissance thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving.\nThe first printed edition (\"editio princeps\"), an \"incunabula\" version, was published by the Veronese scholar Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496), but none were illustrated. The Dominican friar Fra Giovanni Giocondo produced the first version illustrated with woodcuts in Venice in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations.\n\nTranslations into Italian were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by Cesare Cesariano, a Milanese friend of the architect Bramante, printed in Como in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languagesthe first German version was published in 1528and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by Claude Perrault, commissioned by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1664.\n\nThe first English translation followed in 1692, although John Shute had drawn on the text as early as 1563 for his book \"The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture\". The 1692 translation was an abridgment based on the French version of Claude Perrault. English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Sir Henry Wotton's 1624 version \"The Elements of Architecture\" was more of a free adaptation than a literal translation, while a 1692 translation was much abbreviated. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius' work had become a popular subject of hermeneutics, with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed.\n\nThe rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the Renaissance, prompting the rebirth of Classical architecture in subsequent centuries. Renaissance architects, such as Niccoli, Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, found in \"De architectura\" their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a scientific discipline as well as emphasising the skills of the artisan. Leonardo da Vinci's best known drawing, the \"Vitruvian man\", is based on the concepts of proportion developed by Vitruvius.\n\nThe English architect Inigo Jones and the Frenchman Salomon de Caus were among the first to re-evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and sciences based upon number and proportion (architecture). The 16th-century architect Palladio considered Vitruvius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on Vitruvius' work before conceiving his own architectural precepts.\n\nThe earliest evidence of use of the stereographic projection in a machine is in \"De architectura\" which describes an anaphoric clock (it is presumed, a clepsydra or water clock) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the 1st to 3rd centuries have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were, it is presumed, fairly widespread among Romans.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their musical style has been variously described as psychobilly, Southern rock, hard rock and cowpunk, as well as \"sleaze rock\". The band's lyrical themes mostly revolve around sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock 'n' roll. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\" on the \"Double Live Gonzo\" album.\n\nFollowing the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \"Rider Sighs\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson, formerly of Austin, Texas' Phantom Creeps. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form the Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album \"High as Hell\", and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan a.k.a. Tracy Kickass formerly of NYC's the Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. \n\nNashville Pussy recorded \"Say Something Nasty\" with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters).

{"id": "1972291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972291", "title": "Cindy Ossias", "text": "Cindy Ossias\n\nCindy Ossias is an American lawyer. In the early months of the year 2000, while serving as a long-time senior lawyer for the California Department of Insurance (CDI), Ossias leaked confidential documents exposing the allegedly illegal and corrupt activities of Chuck Quackenbush, then Insurance Commissioner of California and head of CDI, to the state legislative consultant investigating the Commissioner's actions. In 2004, Ossias also took a seat as Director for California government watchdog group Californians Aware.\n\nIn 1983, Ossias graduated from Golden Gate University School of Law. She practiced criminal defense and family law in San Francisco as a sole practitioner before entering public service as a staff attorney in 1986 at the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board.\n\nOssias joined the CDI in January 1990. In 1991, she was appointed by then-Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi to a special task force that wrote the state's regulations governing unfair claims practices by insurance companies. During her tenure at the agency, Ossias served as project manager and lead counsel for CDI's activities following various natural catastrophes, including the Oakland firestorm of 1991, the Southern California wildfires of 1993, and the Northridge earthquake of 1994. She also acted as lead counsel and project manager in disciplinary cases against large insurance companies such as Allstate Insurance, State Farm Insurance, Mercury Insurance Group, UnumProvident Insurance Group (now Unum), and HealthMarkets, Inc. (an insurance holding company).\n\nIn early 2000, Ossias photocopied confidential CDI documents, supplied them to the California State Assembly Insurance oversight committee, and disclosed that fact to the California Highway Patrol. In testimony before the State Assembly committee (which provided her with complete immunity from criminal prosecution), Ossias detailed how CDI's upper management had suppressed findings of insurer wrongdoing after the Northridge earthquake of 1994 and instructed her to shred documents. The reports detailed claims-handling violations by State Farm, Allstate, and 20th Century Insurance, used by Quackenbush to reach settlements with those insurers requiring them to contribute millions of dollars to foundations created by the commissioner. In return, Quackenbush agreed not to fine the companies or to finalize the reports, allowing the firms to donate $12.8 million to private foundations he had created, in lieu of fines of up to $3 billion – the amount recommended by staff based on the egregious findings contained in the confidential documents Ossias felt compelled to disclose to the legislative oversight committee, in fact the very reports that upper CDI management had suppressed. In exposing the corruption within the California Department of Insurance, Ossias risked losing her long-held CDI position, her license to practice law, and her very liberty.\n\nOssias had uncovered evidence of corruption while heading a team of staff lawyers reviewing the insurance company files reflecting claims handling practices following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Another aspect of the scandal was uncovered during the California Senate Insurance oversight committee's investigation: this involved a scheme whereby fraudulent other settlements were entered into between the CDI and insurers who had committed unfair claim and business practices, and these and the earthquake settlement monies were placed in foundations created by Quackenbush and top aides in order to fund projects for personal financial gain and political advancement.\n\nQuackenbush was once considered the most promising Republican candidate for the next Governor’s race, before Ossias came forward to reveal CDI corruption. According to testimony by CDI employees, including Ossias, and Assistant Chief Counsel Robert Hagedorn, the commissioner and his top aides abused their positions for personal gain and acted against consumers’ interests for many years.\n\nQuackenbush resigned from office shortly after Ossias testified before the Legislature. He was never charged, although his Deputy Commissioner was charged with and pleaded guilty to having accepted kickbacks from contributions made from the insurance foundations set up by Quackenbush. Two others were indicted in the same scheme.\n\nIn the wake of Ossias' whistleblowing, a measure was passed (AB 363) permitting lawyers representing governmental clients at any level to report crimes and fraud to law enforcement or to government oversight bodies \"in order to prevent or rectify substantial harm to the public.\" That bill was vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis. A subsequent similar measure passed and was vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nFollowing the Quackenbush events and the term of the acting commissioner (during which period Ossias was assigned only minor cases, thereby appeasing insurers allegedly lobbying for her termination), John Garamendi was reelected Insurance Commissioner. Under Garamendi, Ossias served as lead counsel/project manager in CDI's case involving the claims and business practices of the nation's largest disability income insurance holding company, UnumProvident Corp. The investigation concluded with a settlement with UnumProvident, in which the company paid an $8 million fine, agreed to make substantial changes to their disability income insurance policies sold in California to make them more favorable to their insureds, and agreed to reassess claims that had been denied or terminated between 1997 and 2005. The company also agreed to provide an independent third party review to those claimants not satisfied with the company's reassessment.\n\nSome sources indicated that Ossias considered running for Insurance Commissioner in 2006 as a Democrat. However, she did not run, and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante defeated Kraft Foods heir John Kraft for the Democratic nomination. Bustamante, in turn, lost to Republican businessman Steve Poizner.\n\n"}

Mulaik\n\nStanley Allen Mulaik (born April 9, 1935, in Edinburg, Texas) is Professor Emeritus (retired) at the School of Psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, as well as the head of the Societate American pro Interlingua. Although born in Edinburg, Mulaik lived in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1939 to 1966. For the last 42 years, he has lived in or around the Atlanta, Georgia area. He has two sons who live with their families in the Atlanta area.\n\nMulaik began his education in 1940 at the Kindergarten at the Stewart School, the training school for teachers at the University of Utah. He proceeded through the elementary grades to \"graduate\" from the 9th grade in 1950. That fall he began high school at East High School in Salt Lake City. At the end of his junior year he applied and was accepted to be a Ford Scholar in a special program at the University of Utah financed by the Ford Foundation that took exceptional students at the end of their junior year in high school and admitted them to the University of Utah as freshman to see if they could handle university level courses. Students in this program performed exceptionally and a major portion of Mulaik's class of Ford Scholars later obtained Ph.D.'s in various subjects. Mulaik also entered the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University and at graduation received a commission of 2nd lieutenant in the Army. He received training in artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas and served in a field artillery battalion in the United States Army Reserve until 1963, and then joined a research and development unit with assignments to The Pentagon until 1970, when he went inactive as a captain.\n\nMulaik obtained his B.S. (biology and secondary education, 1956), M.A. (psychology, 1962) and Ph.D. (clinical psychology, 1963) from the University of Utah.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1966 he was a research associate with Dr. Calvin W. Taylor (his dissertation chairman) and his wife to be Jane Stacy on a grant titled Measurement and Prediction of Nursing Performance. Working on this project he learned FORTRAN programming and wrote a factor analysis program to conduct analysis of the project's data. He married the co-principal investigator, Jane Stacy, in 1963, and they had two sons, Stephen and Robert.\nIn 1966 he obtained a post doctoral fellowship in quantitative psychology at the L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Between 1967 and 1970, he was an assistant professor and taught courses on personality and factor analysis in the Department of Psychology at UNC. In 1970 he took a position as an associate professor in the School of Psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and rose to full professor in 1981. He taught courses in introductory statistics, psychometric theory, factor analysis, multivariate statistics, structural equation modelling, personality theory, and introduction to psychology during his career. In 1972 he published the well-received advanced text The Foundations of Factor Analysis.\n\nIn 1982 he was second author with Lawrence James and Jean M. Brett of Causal Analysis: Models, Assumptions and Data. In the interim he published journal articles and book chapters on factor analysis, factor indeterminacy in factor analysis, factor rotation, confirmatory factor analysis, psychometric theory, structural equation modeling, and goodness of fit indices. The work on the book on Causal Analysis with James and Brett led him to a deep interest in the philosophy of causality, objectivity and philosophy in general. He struggled through Wittgenstein and Kant to a passable understanding of each, being strongly influenced by Kant's concepts of analysis and synthesis in thought, and saw their role in metaphors of objectivity, causality, and the self. He published several articles in the journal Philosophy of Science on the history of exploratory statistics in empiricism; metaphoric origins of objectivity, subjectivity and consciousness; a synthesis of deterministic and probabilistic causality with the functional relation concept; and the curve-fitting problem and degrees of freedom. He was strongly influenced by the works of George Lakoff on metaphor and abstract thought and their origin in embodied perception and action. As a result, Mulaik has argued that science is based on the metaphor that \"science is knowledge of objects\". In 1997 he was co-editor with L. Harlow and J. H. Steiger of the book What If There Were No Significance Tests? in which he was the principal author of a chapter with N Raju and R. Harshman defending significance tests in appropriate contexts. In 2009 he published the text Linear Causal Modeling with Structural Equations and in 2010 a revision of the earlier Foundations of Factor Analysis.\n\nHis interest in Interlingua came as an undergraduate at the University of Utah in 1953 when he discovered a column in Science News Letter of science abstracts in Interlingua. He wrote an article on Interlingua for the student literary magazine which came to the attention of Alexander Gode, then the leader of the Interlingua Division of Science Service, who asked for and got permission to print the Mulaik's article in official publications. Mulaik then produced a periodical newsletter Le Foro from 1961 to 1963. After marriage and two sons, and assuming an assistant professorship at the University of North Carolina, he set aside interest in Interlingua until about 1994 when he rediscovered Interlingua in a listserv on linguistics in the internet. He turned to an interest in the problem of the grammatical particles in Interlingua which he had in 1961 when he realized that the Latin grammatical particles in Interlingua were not sanctioned by the prototype principle at the base of Interlingua's vocabulary. They were a provisional solution for the particles when an early study in 1939 by Dr. Gode at the International Auxiliary Language Association yielded only 73 particles, an insufficient number. Mulaik determined that the flaw in Gode's study was that he used only 4 source languages, of which English, with Germanic particles, made little contribution to the particles. That left only three romance languages from which to draw particles by the common prototype principle, and if there were less than three of these with a common prototype for a particle, no solution was produced. Mulaik decided that what was needed was to search other minor romance languages for candidates that had a common historical prototype with those in the major romance languages of French, Italian and Spanish/Portuguese. Mulaik chose Catalan/Occitan and Romanian as \"supplementary languages\" to search in these cases. In 2003 Mulaik completed a study of the particle question with 183 particles sanctioned by the prototype principle or other techniques of Interlingua. In 2012 he published a book Interlingua Grammar and Method for The Use of the International Vocabulary As an International Auxiliary Language, which is available from Amazon.com and other vendors. The book is a detailed development of the grammar and sows his personal methods to determine the vocabulary, with several chapters on texts in Interlingua. The book also has 3248-word glossaries between English and Interlingua and Interlingua and English.\n\nHe was the President of the Societate American pro Interlingua, and the editor of its quarterly journal, Confluentes. He was also the editor of the psychological journal \"Multivariate Behavioral Research\" for 8 years.\n\n"}

The species is also cultivated in other regions as an ornamental and as a garden culinary herb. The plant is also reportedly naturalized in Cuba.\n\n\"Allium canadense\" has an edible bulb covered with a dense skin of brown fibers. The plant also has strong onion odor and taste. Crow garlic (\"Allium vineale\") is similar, but it has a strong garlic taste.\n\nThe narrow, grass-like leaves originate near the base of the stem, which is topped by a dome-like cluster of star-shaped, pink or white flowers. These flowers may be partially or entirely replaced by bulblets. When present, the flowers are hermaphroditic (both male and female organs) and are pollinated by American bees (not honeybees) and other insects. It typically flowers in the spring and early summer, from May to June.\n\nThe bulblet-producing form is classified as \"A. canadense\" var. \"canadense\". It was once thought that the tree onion could be related to this plant, but it is now known that the cultivated tree onion is a hybrid between the common onion (\"A. cepa\") and Welsh onion (\"A. fistulosum\"), classified as \"A.\" × \"proliferum\".\n\nFive varieties of the species are widely recognized:\n\nThe Canada onion is cultivated as a vegetable in home gardens in Cuba, scattered locally in the south to western parts of the island. It was formerly collected from the wild to be eaten by Native Americans and by European settlers. People in the Cherokee Nation continue the tradition of picking and cooking wild onions in early spring. Various Native American tribes also used the plant for other purposes: for example, rubbing the plant on the body for protection from insect, lizard, scorpion, and tarantula bites.\n\nThis plant can cause gastroenteritis in young children who ingest parts of this plant. Chronic ingestion of the bulbs reduces iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which can lead to problems. No specific treatment is suggested other than to prevent dehydration (Lampe and McCann 1985). Livestock have also been poisoned by ingesting wild onions, and some have died (Pipal 1918). Horses have developed hemolytic anemia from ingesting wild onion leaves (Scoggan 1989).\n\n"}

{"id": "1972320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1972320", "title": "Housing bubble", "text": "Housing bubble\n\nA housing bubble (or a housing price bubble) is one of several types of asset price bubbles which from time to time occur in the market. The basic concept of a housing bubble is the same as for other asset bubbles, consisting of two main phases. First there is a period where house prices increase dramatically, driven more and more by speculation. In the second phase, house prices fall dramatically. Housing bubbles tend to be among the asset bubbles with the largest effect on the real economy, because they are credit-fueled, because a large number of households participate and not just investors, and because the wealth effect from housing tends to be larger than for other types of financial assets.\n\nMost research papers on housing bubbles uses standard asset price definitions. There are many definitions of bubbles. Most of them are normative definitions, like that of Stiglitz (1990), that try to describe bubbles as periods involving speculation, or argue that bubbles involve prices that cannot be justified by fundamentals. Examples are Palgrave (1926), Flood and Hodrick (1990), Shiller (2015), Smith and Smith (2006) and Cochrane (2010).\n\nStiglitz’ definition is: “…the basic intuition is straightforward: if the reason that the price is high today is only because investors believe that the selling price will be high tomorrow—when ‘fundamental’ factors do not seem to justify such a price—then a bubble exists.” (Stiglitz 1990, p. 13)\n\nLind (2009) argued that we needed a new definition of price bubbles in the housing market, an “anti-Stiglitz” definition. His point is that traditional definitions such as that of Stiglitz (1990), in which bubbles are proposed as arising from prices not being determined by fundamentals, are problematic. This is primarily because the concept “fundamentals” is vague, but also because these type of nominal definitions typically do not refer to a bubble episode as a whole—with both an increase and a decrease of the price.\nLind claims that the solution is to define a bubble by focusing only on the specific development of prices and not on why prices have developed in a certain way. The general definition of a bubble would then simply be:\n“There is a bubble if the (real) price of an asset first increases dramatically over a period of several months or years and then almost immediately falls dramatically.” (Lind 2009, p. 80)\n\nInspired by Lind (2009), Oust and Hrafnkelsson (2017) created the following housing bubble definition: “A large housing price bubble has a dramatic increase in real prices, at least 50% during a five-year period or 35% during a three-year period, followed by an immediate dramatic fall in the prices of at least 35%. A small bubble has a dramatic increase in real prices, at least 35% during a five-year period or 20% during a three-year period, followed by an immediate dramatic fall in the prices of at least 20%.”\n\nOverpricing can be said to be a necessary, but insufficient indicator that a bubble exists. Overpricing is defined more widely than a bubble. An asset may be overpriced without there being a bubble, but you cannot have a (positive) bubble without overpricing. Over- or underpricing may simply be defined as a deviation from the equilibrium price. DiPasquale and Wheaton (1994) say that:\n\"Indeed, it appears to be normal for housing prices to deviate from the fundamental value or equilibrium price, since housing markets clear gradually rather than quickly in a short run.\"\n\nMayer (2011) investigates house price bubbles and finds that there are basically three approaches researchers take when investigating house price differ from equilibrium. \n\nFirst, there is the finance-based method, where the house price equals the discounted future rents. This follows the same logic when performing a stock valuation; the stock price is equal to the discounted sum of all future dividends. The idea is that the value of equity is equal to the discounted dividends. Price rent ratio and user cost of housing are methods that fall under this method. \n\nThe second approach is to compare the costs of building new dwellings against the actual house prices today. Much of the construction cost method has its basis in the demand and supply curve theory. If demand is low, this leads to lower house prices and less construction of new homes. Glaeser and Gyourko (2005) point out that the housing market is characterized by a kinked supply curve that is highly elastic when prices are at or above construction costs. Otherwise, the supply curve is highly inelastic. Housing can be built rather quickly, but since housing is a durable good, old housing does not disappear quickly. Thus, house prices in slow or negative demand growth markets are capped by construction costs. Price construction cost ratio and price building cost ratio are methods that is falls in under this method. \n\nThe last approach by Mayer (2011) is to utilize a combination of house price affordability to derive an equilibrium model. Often house prices are compared to income (income is used as proxy variable for affordability). If house prices are too high, households cannot afford the same level of housing services (affordability). Symmetrically, when house prices are low, households may afford a higher level of housing services. Price income ratio, price wage ratio, price household income ratio are examples of this method. There also exist a set of different affordability measures and indexes that looks at the development in interest payments to income or the cost of the mortgage to income.\nIn addition to using house price equilibrium based on economic measures, there are also possible to use statistical techniques to identifying the long-term price trend, for example HP-filter.\n\n\"1. Sharp increases in the price of an asset like real estate or shares\"\n\n\"2. Great public excitement about said increases\"\n\n\"3. An accompanying media frenzy\"\n\n\"4. Stories of people earning much money, causing envy among people who are not\"\n\n\"5. Growing interest in asset class among the general public\"\n\"6. ”New era” theories to justify unprecedented price increases\"\n\"7. A decline in lending standards\"\n\n\"1. Interest payments in relation to income for homebuyers\"\n\n- Nominal interest payments in relation to income have been increasing.\n\n- Nominal interest payment in relation to income would have been increasing if historical interest rate levels were applied.\n\n- Real interest payments in relation to income have been increasing.\n\n- Real interest payments in relation to income would have been increasing if historical interest rate levels were applied.\n\n\"2. Housing supply\"\n\n- The easier it is to increase supply, the more likely is the increased price a part of a bubble.\n\n\"3. Buyer expectations about prices\"\n\n- Buyers expect prices to continue to rise or to stabilize on a level that is much higher than historical trends.\n\n- Buyers believe that even in a median term perspective (three to five years) investing in housing is almost risk‐free.\n\n\"4. Buyers risk‐taking and impatience\"\n\n- People are entering ownership at an earlier age or at a higher quality level.\n\n- Buyers tend to choose riskier financing alternatives than earlier.\n\n- Buyers are amortizing less than earlier.\n\n\"5. Bank behavior\"\n\n- Banks are increasing or at least not decreasing loan to value ratios for buyers on the housing market when prices increase.\n-Banks become more liberal when judging the credit worthiness of households.\n\n\"6. Speculative behavior\"\n\n- A larger share of home‐buyers than usual are planning to sell rather quickly again.\n\nHousing prices vs. vacancy rate. A large number of vacancies will have a downward pressure on prices, since in this case; supply exceeds demand (Geltner, Miller, Clayton, & Eichholtz, 2007). Alternatively the opposite: occupancy rate. \n\nReal housing prices vs. demography. If there is a net inflow of tenants the cost of dwelling can be expected to increase (Englund, 2011).\n\nHousing prices vs. GDP can be used if data on income is unavailable, since changes in GDP and income can be expected to correlate (Claussen, Jonsson, & Lagerwall, 2011).\n\nThe loan to value ratio (LTV) is a good indicator for the risk involved for the lender as well as for the borrower. The higher the ratio the higher is the risk (Kokko, 1999). \n\nThe debt service ratio or debt coverage ratio (DSCR), i.e. the ratio of funds available for the payment of interest and principal. This is considered a good indicator for the level of risk involved (Joshi, 2006).\n\nThe ratio between loan and disposable income should not change over time. An increase above the long term average indicates that the market may be overvalued (Finocchinaro, Nilsson, Nyberg, & Soultanaeva, 2011).\n\nHousing prices vs. interest rates. If interest rates increase it will be more expensive to own a piece of real estate and to compensate for the higher user cost it can be expected that the price will drop. (Englund, 2011).\n\nHigh and increasing house price growth. Oust and Hrafnkelsson (2017)\n\nThe table is from Oust and Hrafnkelsson (2017) and has been constructed using their bubble definition.

The 30-minute engagement, which historian J. R. Edmondson describes as \"the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution\", occurred on the grounds of Mission Concepción, south of what is now Downtown San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas.\n\nOn October 13, the newly created Texian Army under Stephen F. Austin had marched towards Bexar, where General Martín Perfecto de Cos commanded the remaining Mexican soldiers in Texas. On October 27, Austin sent Bowie and Fannin, with 90 soldiers, to find a defensible spot near Bexar for the Texian Army to rest. After choosing a site near Mission Concepción, the scouting party camped for the night and sent a courier to notify Austin. After learning that the Texian Army was divided, Cos sent Ugartechea with 275 soldiers to attack the Texians camped at Concepción. The Texians took cover in a horseshoe-shaped gully; their good defensive position, longer firing range, and better ammunition helped them to repel several Mexican attacks, and the Mexican soldiers retreated just 30 minutes before the remainder of the Texian Army arrived. Historians estimate that between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed, while only one Texian soldier died.\n\nThe newly organized Texian Army, determined to put a decisive end to Mexican control over Texas, began marching towards San Antonio de Bexar on October 13, 1835. Days earlier, General Martín Perfecto de Cos, brother-in-law of the Mexican president, had arrived in Bexar to take command of all the Mexican forces in Texas. By October 20 the Texians—led by Stephen F. Austin, the first empresario to bring English-speaking settlers to Texas—had reached Salado Creek and initiated a siege of Béxar. To keep the Texians from examining Mexican defensive measures, Mexican troops attempted to restrict access to and from the city. Despite those efforts, several people were able to leave their homes and join the Texians. Among those was James Bowie, who was well known for his fighting prowess; stories of his exploits in the Sandbar Fight and his search for the lost San Saba mine had been widely reported.\n\nOn October 22, Austin named Bowie a colonel and gave him joint command of the 1st Battalion with Captain James W. Fannin. Before nightfall the 1st Battalion began a reconnaissance mission to evaluate the former missions around San Antonio as potential campsites. Locals familiar with the area, Juan Seguín and his Texians, would guide the men along the river. After investigating three of the missions, Bowie and Fannin selected Mission San Francisco de la Espada as the most promising campsite. The rest of the Texian Army joined them there early on October 27. Eager to move closer to Bexar, Austin immediately sent Bowie and Fannin to find a good defensive spot for the army to rest that night.\n\nBowie and Fannin were accompanied by ninety soldiers, divided into four companies led by Captains Andrew Briscoe, Robert Coleman, Michael Goheen, and Valentine Bennet. The group took a northerly route, following the San Antonio River past Missions San Juan and San José. Along the way they encountered a small party of Mexican scouts, who retreated to Bexar after a brief skirmish.\n\nApproximately from San Antonio de Bexar and from the Texian camp at Espada, the Texian scouting party stopped at Mission Concepción. Five hundred yards (460 m) west of the mission, the San Antonio River curved in a small horseshoe shape, with the two sides of the river's curve approximately apart. According to historian Alwyn Barr, \"trees shaded both sides of the broad riverbottom which lay about six feet below the level of the rolling praire nearby\". Rather than return immediately to Austin, as their orders specified, Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to bring Austin directions to Concepción. The next day, an angry Austin issued a statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with court-martial.\n\nThe Texian scouting party divided into two camps. Fannin supervised 49 men at the south part of the horseshoe bend, while Bowie and the remaining men camped at the northern part of the bend. Any Mexican force coming from the north would be caught in their cross-fire. Pickets were stationed around the area and in the mission tower, which offered greater visibility. As they settled down for the evening, the Texians were surprised to see a Mexican cannonball, fired from one of the church towers in Bexar, hit just beyond their camp. Many of the Texian soldiers believed that a priest from the mission had informed the Mexican Army of their position.\n\nHoping to neutralize the Texian force at Concepción before the remainder of the Texian Army arrived, Cos ordered Colonel Domingo Ugartechea to lead an early-morning assault on October 28. At 6:00 a.m., Ugartechea left Bexar with 275 Mexican soldiers and 2 cannons. Heavy fog delayed their approach, and the Mexican soldiers did not reach Concepción until 7:30 or 8:00 a.m. A Mexican cavalry scout fired at Texian picket Henry Karnes; after returning fire, Karnes ran back to his company, frustrated because, as he put it, \"Boys, the scoundrels have shot off my powder horn\". The Texians took refuge in the gully, firing from its edge before dropping the down to the river level to reload. As the remaining Texian sentries hurried to join the main body of Texian soldiers, Pen Jarvis was struck by a Mexican bullet and fell down the river bank. The bullet hit a knife Jarvis had slipped through the front of his belt, and he suffered only bruises.\n\nThe Texian position was surrounded by trees, leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver. The 200 members of the cavalry remained on the west bank of the river, behind the Texians, to foil any escape attempts. Lieutenant Colonel José Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians. In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire. The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift. At that point, 50–60 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians. Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, \"Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!\" At from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle. They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect. For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians. According to Texian Noah Smithwick, \"grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan trees overhead, raining a shower of ripe nuts down on us, and I saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther.\" In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that \"The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect.\" The Mexican infantry were assigned Brown Bess muskets, which had a maximum range of only , compared to the effective range of the Texian long rifles. The Texians were short of ammunition, however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful, it was poor quality. In several cases, Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers, causing little damage other than a bruise.\n\nWhen Mexican officers ordered a charge on the south bend held by Fannin, Bowie sent Coleman's company to help. Most of the Texian reinforcements maneuvered to their new position from below the river bank, but several rose from cover and dashed across the prairie. One of them, Richard Andrews, was hit in the side with grapeshot and died several hours after the battle.\n\nAs the reinforcements reached the southern part of the horseshoe, the Mexican infantry fell back, leaving the cannon within of the Texians. Texians redirected their fire to the cannoneers. After three different sets of gunners were killed or wounded, the cannons were abandoned. The Mexican infantry attempted three attacks; all were repulsed. As the Mexican buglers called for a retreat, the infantry fell back beyond Texian rifle range. The Mexican cavalry was sent to retrieve wounded men and the cannon. As the cavalry approached, Bowie led a charge onto the prairie. The Texians quickly captured the cannon and turned it on the fleeing Mexican soldiers. Grapeshot killed one of the mule drivers, causing his caisson to go out of control and \"careen[...] through the shattered Mexican ranks\". The battle had lasted only 30 minutes.\n\nAustin had intended to reunite the two parts of his army early on October 28, but the group camping at Mission Espada had delayed their departure to unsuccessfully pursue a company that had deserted. Lieutenant Colonel William Barret Travis and his company of cavalry rode ahead of the main body of the army. When they reached Concepción, the Mexican Army was still visible in the distance. The small band of Texian cavalry pursued but the Mexican soldiers reached Bexar safely.\n\nLess than 30 minutes after the battle ended, the rest of the Texian Army arrived. Austin felt that the Mexican morale must be low after their defeat and wanted to proceed immediately to Bexar. Bowie and other officers refused, as they believed Bexar was too heavily fortified. The Texians searched the area for any Mexican equipment which had been abandoned during the retreat. They found several boxes of cartridges. Complaining that the Mexican powder was \"little better than pounded charcoal\", the Texians emptied the cartridges but kept the bullets.\n\nThat evening, Austin allowed a local priest and men from Bexar to retrieve the bodies of the Mexican soldiers who had died in battle. Barr estimated that at least 14 Mexican soldiers were killed, with an additional 39 wounded, several of whom died later. Timothy Todish et al., in their book \"The Alamo Sourcebook\", estimated that 60 Mexican soldiers were killed, while historian Stephen Hardin claimed that 76 Mexican soldiers died. The only Texian to die in battle was Andrews, and Jarvis was the only Texian classified as wounded.\n\nThis battle, which historian J. R. Edmondson describes as \"the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution\", was the last offensive against the Texians that Cos would order. Barr attributed the Texian victory to \"able leadership, a strong position, and greater firepower\". The Mexican cavalry was unable to fight effectively in the wooded, riverbottom terrain, and the weapons of the Mexican infantry had a much lower range than that of the Texians. Although Barr continues that the battle \"should have taught ... lessons on Mexican courage and the value of a good defensive position\", Hardin believes that \"the relative ease of the victory at Concepción instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies\". A soldier who later served under Fannin complained that Fannin's \"former experience in fighting Mexicans [at Concepción] had led him to neglect to take such precautionary measures as were requisite\", which may have contributed to his defeat at the Battle of Coleto in March 1836.\n\n\n"}
