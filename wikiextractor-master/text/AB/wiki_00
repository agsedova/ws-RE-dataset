It is one of the most notable pieces of Art Nouveau architecture in former Galicia. The station was opened to the public in 1904, and celebrated its centennial anniversary on 26 March 2004. On a monthly basis, the terminal handles over 1.2 million passengers and moves 16 thousand tons of freight.\n\nConstruction of an extensive net of railways within the Austro-Hungarian Empire allowed the city of Lemberg (its German name at the time) to retain its nodal position at the crossing of several notable trade routes. As the capital of Galicia, the city needed a new, representative and large railway station that would suit the city needs and replace the old neo-Gothic railway station built between 1861 and 1862 with the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis.\n\nIn 1888 the Polish architect and a graduate of the Lwów Technical Academy Władysław Sadłowski was selected to design a new station. The final project, prepared in less than a year, encompassed a large, horizontally-oriented main hall, with two large train yards located in the background. The main entrance was topped with a large dome made of bolted steel and stained glass. Both wings of the symmetrical building were constituted by two pavilions, each with a smaller cupola.\n\nThe main entrance was flanked by a set of Tuscan columns and large mythological sculptures, with the one representing Hypnos being the most notable. Since Sadłowski was the main representative of the William Morris' Arts and Crafts movement in Poland, his project included not only the architectural part of the future building, but also the ornaments and decorations. The project of three waiting halls (one for each class of travellers) was prepared in cooperation with another graduate of Sadłowski's \"alma mater\", Alfred Zachariewicz.\n\nThe first class waiting hall was modelled after the style of an English gentleman's club, and was equipped with dark, luxurious Viennese-style furniture, resembling the works of the Wiener Werkstätte. The second class waiting room was modelled after 19th century burgher houses in Galicia, while the third class waiting hall was equipped with simple wooden pieces of furniture, modelled after the Zakopane style of Polish Gorals made by the artist Tadeusz Obmiński.\n\nThe ornaments featured in the tunnels leading to the platforms and in the platforms themselves were prepared by the Kraków-based company of Józef Górecki. Made of bent steel, the balustrades and railings bore direct resemblance to the style of the Paris Métro ornaments designed by Hector Guimard. A design for the registers was constructed in Zieleniewski Maschinen und Wagonbau-Gesellschaft Werk Sanok, (Autosan).\n\nConstruction started in 1899 and lasted until 1904, when the railway station was opened to the public. It was visited by some of the most renowned architects of the epoch, and influenced the later construction of the train stations in Prague (Josef Franta, 1909) and Vienna (Otto Wagner).\n\nDuring World War II, when the city was under the rule of the Soviet Union, the occupied eastern Poland railways were integrated into the Soviet Railway system. The station suffered extensive damage during the war, including a completely destroyed trainshed. There was an open debate on whether to restore the building or to dismantle the ruins and build anew. Architect G.F. Domashenko managed to bring both parties to agreement, and between 1949 and 1953 the old structure was given a contemporary Stalinist interior, whilst a full repair on the outside preserved its original view. Frequent renovations and upgrades ensured that the service and building was always up to modern standards, a tradition which Ukraine continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century, with the most recent major restoration being carried out in 2003.\n\n\n"}

His most public role was as the chief executive officer of Australia's largest telecommunications company Telstra from 1999 to 2004. During his tenure, he oversaw the privatisation of the then government-owned corporation through a series of public tranche sales (known as the \"T1\", \"T2\" and \"T3\" sales). Currently, he is the chairman of both NBN Co and Suncorp, a director of Healthscope, Oil Search and Tabcorp and the Chancellor of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University).\n\nSwitkowski was born in Germany in 1948 to Polish parents. His family migrated to Australia when he was one year old and settled in Melbourne. He attended St Bernard's College in Essendon (a suburb of Melbourne), and earned a bachelor's degree in science and a doctorate in nuclear physics (at 24 years old) from the University of Melbourne. He then completed six years of postdoctoral research and the six-week Advanced Management Program of the Harvard Business School in 1993.\n\nBefore his tenure at Telstra, Switkowski was chief executive officer of Australia's second largest telecommunications company Optus and the photographic equipment company Kodak (Australasia). He also served as chairman and managing director of Kodak (Australasia) from 1992 to 1996. During this time, he served as a non-executive director of the multinational packaging company Amcor from 1995 to 1999.\n\nIn 1995, Switkowski received the Advance Australia Award for outstanding achievement in industry and commerce.\n\nOn 1 March 1999, Switkowski was appointed chief executive officer of Australia's public and largest telecommunications company Telstra, and to the board of directors of Telstra's pay television partner Foxtel. Before his appointment, he was group managing director of Telstra's Business and International Development division.\n\nDuring his tenure at Telstra, Switkowski oversaw the introduction of a number of services to the company; such as its major internet service provider subsidiary BigPond, and substantial expansion of others; such as its advertising and directories subsidiary Pacific Access (later re-branded as Sensis in 2002).\n\nSwitkowski oversaw the implementation of the second tranche sale of Telstra (the 'T2' sale) on the Australian Stock Exchange, New Zealand Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange that began in September 1999. The first tranche sale of Telstra (the 'T1' sale) took place before Switkowski was appointed CEO of Telstra. He also oversaw the planning for the third tranche sale of Telstra (the 'T3' sale).\n\nSwitkowski resigned from Telstra on 3 December 2004, and was replaced by Solomon Trujillo.\n\nOn 3 October 2013, Switkowski was confirmed as the new chairman and interim CEO of NBN Co by Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and reverted to the role of Non-Executive Chairman from 2 April 2014 following the appointment of Bill Morrow as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn 6 June 2006, Switkowski was appointed to chair a Commonwealth Government inquiry into the viability of a domestic nuclear power industry. He was later appointed chairman of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) by federal Minister for Science Julie Bishop on 4 March 2007. Switkowski was originally appointed to the board of ANSTO on 1 January 2006, but stood down when appointed to the inquiry. After the completion of the inquiry, he was then reappointed to the board as chairman on 1 March 2007. His term as chairman concluded at the end of 2010.\n\nThe inquiry concluded that Australia is well positioned to increase its production and export of uranium as well as adding nuclear power to its own energy mix. However, an independent panel of Australian scientists and nuclear experts have been critical of these findings, claiming that they relied upon flawed assumptions while dodging important questions such as the disposal of radioactive waste and the potential greenhouse gas implications of increased mining.\n\nOn 19 September 2005, Switkowski took a non-executive director role with Suncorp-Metway – his first position after resigning from Telstra. Since then he has become the chairman as of the 2011 Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn 2006, Switkowski was appointed president of the board of directors of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image on 1 January – for a three-year term. He also took non-executive director roles with Healthscope on 19 January, and with Tabcorp Holdings on 2 October.\n\nIn 2011 Switkowski was serving as a director of Rare Earth's miner Lynas Corporation as per the director's Share Purchase Notice.\n\nSwitkowski also currently serves as chairman of Opera Australia and on the board of directors of the Business Council of Australia.\n\nSwitkowski currently serves on the Board of Oilsearch.\n\nOn 27 October 2010, it was announced that Switkowski would become the Chancellor of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University). He was officially appointed to the position on 1 January 2011.\n\nIn the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours List, Switkowski was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), for \"distinguished service to the community, particularly to tertiary education administration, scientific organisations and the telecommunications sector, to business, and to the arts\".\n\nSwitkowski is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors (FAICD) and also of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE). In 2015 he was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA).\n\nSwitkowski is married and lives with his wife near Cape Schanck, on Melbourne's Mornington Peninsula.\n\n"}
{"id": "1914123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914123", "title": "Adelospondyli", "text": "Adelospondyli\n\nAdelospondyli is an order of elongated, presumably aquatic, Carboniferous amphibians (\"sensu lato\"). They have a robust skull roofed with solid bone, and orbits located towards the front of the skull. The limbs were almost certainly absent, although some historical sources reported them to be present. Despite the likely absence of limbs, adelospondyls retained a large part of the bony shoulder girdle. Adelospondyls have been assigned to a variety of groups in the past. They have traditionally been seen as members of the subclass Lepospondyli, related to other unusual early tetrapods such as \"microsaurs\", \"nectrideans\", and aïstopods. Analyses such as Ruta & Coates (2007) have offered an alternate classification scheme, arguing that adelospondyls were actually far removed from other lepospondyls, instead being stem-tetrapod stegocephalians closely related to the family Colosteidae.\n\nMost adelospondyls belong to the family Adelogyrinidae, and prior to 2003 the order and family were considered synonymous. In 2003, Ruta \"et al\". assigned \"Acherontiscus\" to the order as the only known non-adelogyrinid member. Members of this group are very rare; only six known specimens can be assigned to the five known genera with absolute confidence. These specimens are known from Mississippian (Serpukhovian Age) geological deposits in Scotland, and they were among the oldest \"lepospondyls\" known from fossils.\n\nAdelospondyls share a variety of traits with other lepospondyls, although whether these traits are an example of convergent evolution is a controversial topic. Like the aïstopods and lysorophian \"microsaurs\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the aïstopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in \"Adelogyrinus\" and \"Palaeomolgophis\" by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in \"Adelospondylus\", but these later considered to be hyoids as in \"Adelogyrinus\".\n\nAdelospondyls had somewhat long and low skulls, with large orbits (eye sockets) shifted towards the front of the skull. As a result, the proportions of the skull bones were affected. For example, the nasal bones along the midline of the skull in front of the eyes were much shorter than the frontal bones directly behind them, which extended forwards past the level of the eyes. The frontal bones were omitted from the edge of the orbits (eye holes) due to a contact between the pre- and post-frontals which typically lie in front of and behind the orbits, respectively. Unlike lysorophians and aïstopods, which had snake-like skulls with large openings and reduced bone material, adelospondyl skulls were strongly built and covered with ridges, pits, and grooves, including lateral line sulci. They typically possessed many teeth, although such teeth differ in structure between families. Adelogyrinids, for example, had many numerous \"chisel-shaped\" teeth, while \"Acherontiscus\" had blunt teeth at the back of the mouth and sharp, thin teeth at the front. As is the case in other lepospondyls, the teeth of adelospondyls did not have a maze-like internal structure like those of \"labyrinthodonts\", nor did adelospondyls possess enlarged fang-like teeth on the roof of the mouth.\n\nSimilar to various other lepospondyls, adelospondyls lost several bones in the temporal region of the skull, which is at the back of the skull between the quadratojugal bone of the jaw joint and the parietal and postparietal bones at the midline of the skull roof. Stem- and crown-tetrapods typically have three to four bones on each side of the skull in this region (from top to bottom): the tabular, supratemporal (and sometimes an adjacent intertemporal), and squamosal. The intertemporal is lost (or fused into other bones) in a variety of unrelated tetrapod groups. The same process additionally occurs to the supratemporal in several lepospondyls, namely \"microsaurs\" and a few \"nectrideans\" such as \"Scincosaurus\" and diplocaulids. Adelospondyls take this one step further. They possess only a single bone between the jaw joint and the skull roof. This bone is often believed to be a fusion between the tabular and the squamosal (termed a \"tabular-squamosal\" or \"squamosotabular\"), although it is also conceivable that the tabular disappeared completely leaving only the enlarged squamosal in its place.\n\nAdelospondyls can also be characterized by their vertebrae compared to other lepospondyls. They were spool-shaped and high in number, with \"Acherontiscus\" having an estimated 64 vertebrae and an indeterminate juvenile adelogyrinid having at least 70. Most of these vertebrae lack haemal spines, indicating that the primary elongation took place in the body rather than the tail. The neural spines are not fused to the centra, a characteristic which D.M.S. Watson (1929) used to characterize the adelospondyls as a distinct order. In fact, the name \"adelospondyl\" is Greek for \"obscure vertebra\", referencing both the rarity of adelospondyls and this trait. However, Watson also included \"Lysorophus\" as an adelospondyl rather than a lysorophian \"microsaur\", and other studies have shown that the absence of neurocentral fusion is very common among tetrapods, and therefore useless as a distinguishing feature. However, adelospondyls do have an additional quality of the vertebrae which is unique compared to other lepospondyls. In most lepospondyls, the left and right halves of each vertebra's neural arch are separate, rather than fused as in other tetrapods. Adelospondyls retain the primitive condition of the two halves being completely fused, making their vertebrae unique among lepospondyls. \"Acherontiscus\" deviates from the norm of the subclass even more than other adelospondyls, as it possessed two separate bony components of the centra, rather than a single centrum (which is the case in adelogyrinids and other lepospondyls). These two different components (the intercentrum at the front and pleurocentrum at the back) were nearly equal in size, similar to the vertebrae of embolomeres.\n\nAlthough adelospondyls lost all trace of their fore- and hind-limbs, they did retain a notable remnant of their presumably limbed ancestors. This remnant is a large bony dermal shoulder girdle, comprising the plate-like interclavicle which was positioned on the midline of the chest, two clavicle bones on either side of it, and two boomerang-shaped cleithrum bones at the base of the neck. On the other hand, the bones of the endochondral shoulder girdle (i.e. the scapulae and coracoids), which supported the forelimbs, were lost along with the limbs. Adelospondyls possessed a large bony hyoid apparatus, including gill-supporting bones such as hypobranchials and ceratobranchials. Long, thin scales have been preserved in most adelospondyl specimens, and they were more abundant on the ventral (belly) side of the body rather than the dorsal (back) side.\n\n\n"}

The park is owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment and has an annual attendance of just over 4.1 million a year, making it the second most visited among all SeaWorld-owned parks behind SeaWorld Orlando, and eleventh overall among the 20 most visited amusement parks in North America.\n\nThe park has been home to many notable roller coasters and thrill rides, including SheiKra, the first Dive Coaster in North America and at the time of opening, was the longest, tallest and fastest in the world; Tigris, the tallest launch coaster in Florida; Montu, which was the tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster in the world at the time of opening; Falcon's Fury, the tallest free-standing drop tower in North America; and the upcoming Iron Gwazi, a hybrid roller coaster which is expected to become the tallest in North America as well as the fastest and steepest in the world when it opens.\n\nBusch Gardens Tampa opened on March 31, 1959 as an admission-free hospitality facility which provided guests with the opportunity to taste the beer. In addition to various beer tastings, they had a bird garden and the \"Stairway to the Stars\", which was an escalator that took guests to the roof of the brewery where the tour began.\n\nOver time, as popularity in Busch Gardens grew so did the company. Just as it is today, the birds roamed free, where the guests were free to pet them.  Millions visited, and in a stroke of brilliance wildlife-lover, August A. Busch Jr. added the 29-acre Serengeti Plains in 1965, which eventually expanded to 70 acres. The gigantic Serengeti Plain allowed the African wildlife to roam freely and became the largest, free-roaming habitat outside of Africa. It remains one of the most unique features of the park to this day and has received numerous upgrades and expansions. Busch Gardens continued to focus on its tropical landscape, exotic animals and amusements to draw visitors.\n\nBusch Gardens began charging admission as the entertainment became more complex, with extra fees for the thrill rides, such as the roller coasters for which Busch Gardens is now known for. The very popular \"Sesame Street\" kid area was once \"The Land of the Dragons\" area, the second kid-friendly area introduced in the park. The first roller coaster introduced the park was the \"Python\", which sparked more and more business. From then on came Scorpion, Kumba, Montu, Sand Serpent, etc. As of recently, Busch Gardens opened its newest roller coaster in April 2019 called \"Tigris,\" which is labeled as a \"Skyrocket.\" Tigris is said to be the tallest launch roller coaster in Florida, thus giving Busch Gardens more attention. An upcoming attraction that is under construction, is called Iron Gwazi, which is to be finished by Spring 2020. They announced that it is a hybrid wooden-steel roller coaster, and is located where \"Gwazi\" once stood. It is said to be the world's fastest and steepest hybrid roller coaster.\n\nNot only do the roller coasters bring in loads of visitors, but with the introduction of events, such as the famous \"Howl-O-Scream\", \"Christmas Town\", and \"Food and Wine Festival\", it drew even more attention to the park.\n\n\nThe park's main entrance. Treats can be purchased at the Sultan's Sweets and the Zagora Cafe. The Moroccan Palace is located here, as well as the outdoor Marrakesh Theater. Gwazi was the major ride in this area and a new hybrid roller coaster ride (Iron Gwazi) will take its place.\n\n\nFormer \"Land of the Dragons\" children's section of the park. Land of the Dragons, which itself replaced the Dwarf Village in 1995, was replaced by Sesame Street Safari of Fun on March 27, 2010. It contains all the attractions from Land of the Dragons which are now re-themed. It also contains four new attractions.\nThis section of the park is home to one of the park's water rides, Stanley Falls Flume. It is also home to launch coaster Tigris, and SheiKra, which was the first and only Dive Coaster in the United States until the addition of Griffon at the sister park Busch Gardens Williamsburg. The section opened up in 1973 with the addition of the Stanley Falls Flume. The African Queen Boat Ride opened in 1977 as Busch's version of Disney's Jungle Cruise. The African Queen featured live animals, including alligators, crocodiles, rhinoceroses and spider monkeys. A colorful South American macaw rode on each boat as a first mate. There was also a cast member, dressed in African warrior regalia, who surprised each boat as it passed through a riverside village. The warrior was featured in television ads for the park in the early 1980s. In 1989, the African Queen Boat Ride was transformed into Tanganyika Tidal Wave with the addition of a drop that generates a giant splash. The section remained unchanged until 2005 when SheiKra opened and the surrounding area was renovated.\n\n\nThis section, themed to the jungles of Congo, contains two of the park's most popular rides, Kumba and Congo River Rapids. In November 2006, Congo underwent a major renovation, including the removal of the park's classic Python corkscrew roller coaster. Other former Congo attractions include the Swinging Vines, family swing flat ride closing in the early 1990s and the Monstrous Mamba octopus flat ride closing in the late 1990s. And the Pygmy Village kids area featuring three children's rides, a teacup ride, a kiddie swing ride relocated to Sesame Street Safari of Fun and the Gwazi Gliders moved to Morocco.\n\n\nOpened on April 5, 2008, Jungala is a family attraction featuring up-close animal encounters, rope bridges to explore three stories of jungle life, and a water-play area for children. Also located in this area are two family attractions: Jungle Flyers, a zip line that offers three different flight patterns above the treetops of the new area, and Wild Surge, a shot tower that launches guests above a waterfall. Another attraction is Tiger Trail, which is a walkthrough with tigers where there is also a glass turret where you can look out right in the middle of the tiger enclosure. During the Kareebu Jungala atmosphere show, stiltwalkers perform with puppets and interact with guests in the heart of Jungala.\n\nA section originally themed after the malls and bazaars of Africa that opened up in May 1980 as \"Timbuktu\". The Phoenix was built in 1984 and remains a popular ride to this day. The section was renovated in 2003. Important elements added during this facelift included the enclosing of the Timbuktu Theater, which replaced the park's Dolphin Theater with an indoor 4-D movie theater. The dolphins retired to other locations. The 4-D theater premiered with \"R.L Stine's Haunted Lighthouse\" film in 2003, followed by \"Pirates 4D\" in 2006 and \"Sesame Street Presents: Lights! Camera! Imagination!\" in 2010. In 2004, Das Festhaus was transformed into the Desert Grill, and the park's family-friendly Sand Serpent wild mouse roller coaster opened, replacing the Crazy Camel Trabant flat ride. In September 2014, Falcon's Fury, a 335-foot drop tower, opened, replacing the former Sandstorm orbiter flat ride. This section of the park was re-themed to \"Pantopia\" alongside the opening of Falcon's Fury.\n\n\nAlligators and crocodiles can be observed here up close. In Curiosity Cavern, guests can view mammal and reptile exhibits. Visitors to Nairobi can meet the Animal Ambassadors who travel the country and make educational appearances at Jambo Junction. The area also contains Myombe Reserve, a tropical rainforest that is home to Western lowland gorillas and common chimpanzees. In 2012 the Animal Care Center opened, allowing guests to observe actual veterinary procedures, as well as meet the stars of \"Wildlife Docs\", Busch Gardens' Saturday morning television show. The main train station at Busch Gardens is located at Nairobi. Another popular attraction here is the Asian elephant exhibit. Nairobi used to have a safari truck ride called Rhino Rally, similar to Kilimanjaro Safaris at Walt Disney World. The attraction closed in 2015.\n\nEdge of Africa, otherwise known at Cheetah Hunt Plaza, is the smallest section of the park. It features a restaurant, The Serengeti Overlook Restaurant and Pub, the Cheetah Hunt roller coaster, and the Skyride station.\n\nBedouin tents, authentic handicrafts and art create an Egyptian marketplace feel. The primary attraction of the Egypt-themed area is Montu, an inverted steel coaster. Tut's Tomb, a former audio guided walk-through tomb excavation closed in Winter 2013 and the interior was gutted to make way for the queue for Cobra's Curse. The former Golden Scarab Gift Shop was converted into a gift shop at the exit of the attraction.\n\nBusch Gardens is Tampa's largest zoo, with more than 200 species of animals.\n\nA state-of-the-art facility that allows visitors to view animal care being conducted from treatments to x-rays.\n\nA free flight aviary that shows over 500 tropical birds from around the globe including parrots, flamingos and others. The original section of the park opened in 1959. The area for the most part remains mostly gardens and animal exhibits. A staple attraction that once stood in this section was the brewery. However, the brewery closed in 1995 and Gwazi now sits where the brewery was located. In 2014, the Bird Gardens theater was demolished and the former show (Critter Castaways) is now housed in the Pantopia Theater under the new name \"Opening Night Critters\".\n\nOpened in 1997, Edge of Africa is a walk-through attraction where guests can observe African animals. Among the exhibits are a Nile crocodile named Sobek, meerkats, two prides of lions, a pack of spotted hyenas, three hippos named Moyo, Kita and Devi, vultures, and a troop of lemurs.\n\nThe three newest members of the lion pride include a male named Kembe and two females named Shaba and Shtuko. They arrived at the park as cubs in 2013 from a zoo in Africa. Another pride of lions at the park include a male named Simon and two females named Rose and Iris. Iris and Rose are unable to have cubs as they have been spayed.\n\nThe hippos Moyo and Kita are never exhibited together, being father and daughter, and being unaware of this would try to mate with each other. Therefore, both are rotated into the exhibit and holding area day by day to avoid accidental inbreeding.\n\nIn 1965, the park opened its Serengeti Plain animal habitat, the first of its kind to offer animals in a free-roaming environment. Over the years, the habitat has expanded from to its current size of . It is home to the Grévy's zebra, Grant's zebra, sable antelope, reticulated giraffe, Ankole-Watusi, addax, white rhinoceros, eland, impala, ostrich and marabou stork. Also, in a secluded area of this region is a solitary female black rhinoceros named Jodi.\n\nFrom January to March, Busch Gardens hosts a weekly concert series which invites popular bands either in big band music or pop to perform classic or contemporary songs.\n\n(Previously called Bud & BBQ and Bands, Brew & BBQ) For the months of March & April, Busch Gardens hosts a series of concerts in Gwazi Field, mostly from classic rock and country music acts. Sometimes the event includes alternative rock, pop, hip hop and R&B acts as well as comedians. Also, there are special culinary offerings that include a variety of ethnic food and wine samplings from various local vendors along the walkway from the Gwazi Roller Coaster to the gate in Gwazi Field.\n\nThe documentary film \"Blackfish\" and a subsequent online petition led to several popular musical groups cancelling performances at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens \"Bands, Brew & BBQ\" event in 2014. This caused the removal of the event in Tampa, which was replaced by the annual Food and Wine Festival, resembling the one currently at Epcot in Walt Disney World Orlando.\n\nIn March, several Latin music acts are hosted on the stage in Gwazi Field. There is a similar culinary setup with special offerings for the concert days as there is for Bands, Brew & BBQ.\n\nIn the summer months, the park stays open later and includes concerts by performers like David Cassidy and Starship with Mickey Thomas. The park's Independence Day festivities add fireworks to the entertainment lineup.\n\nIn 2010, Busch Gardens added a new nighttime show called Kinetix, the first special effect-heavy show put on in Gwazi Field. Also, they added many new special effects (i.e. Strobe, Lighting, Fog) to the existing rides just for the Summer Nights season. Kinetix discontinued after the 2016 Summer Nights\n\nSince 2017, Busch Gardens Summer Nights now includes party zones where guests can dance with Party Starters and DJs to the music and compete for special prizes. The most major party zones are ¡Fiesta Festa! in the Cheetah Hunt Plaza and Tigris's Party Zone (formally Viben Village) in Stanleyville. On every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, guests can compete in the “Dance Challenge“ at Gwazi Park to win 4 FREE tickets to Adventure Island as well as an epic fireworks show directly afterward.\n\nEvery September and October since 2000, Busch Gardens is transformed into Howl-O-Scream. This event contains haunted houses, scare zones and shows. Howl-O-Scream is one of the top rated Halloween events in the United States. Howl-O-Scream has featured some attractions of the park turned into \"horrified\" attractions at night. This includes Serengeti Safari Tours, which was turned into Evening Serengeti Safari Tours and Curiosity Caverns, which was turned into Dark Cavern, both in 2000. In 2012, Howl-O-Scream celebrated 13 \"unlucky\" years.\n\nFrom November to December, theaters throughout the park are transformed into Christmas-themed shows (Like Christmas On Ice in the Moroccan Palace) in celebration of the holiday season for an event called Christmas Town. The whole park is decorated with over a million Christmas lights and theming. Among the more popular attractions is Snow World, in which guests can play in real snow and ride down ice slides. This event was first introduced in 2012. At Santa's House, guests can bring their little ones and have pictures taken with Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, and Santa's Elves right next to the Nairobi Train Station which circles around the Serengeti Plain as the Christmas Town Sing Along Train featuring select Christmas carols and songs. Also, guests can meet the stars from \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" over in Rudolph's Winter Wonderland since 2016. Plus, two Christmas Town princesses can be spotted in the Icy Forest (Ice Princess), and the poinsettia trees (Poinsettia Princess) which guests can also have pictures taken. Princess Fae, a sugarplum princess made her debue during the 2019 Christmas Town season. The poinsetta, sugarplum and icy princesses can also be seen together there near closing time.\n\nDuring New Year's Eve, Busch Gardens celebrates the new year by hosting live music throughout the park, thrill rides opened through the night and fireworks located at the Gwazi Field. Including a park-wide countdown to the new year.\n\nThe following is a list of roller coasters at Busch Gardens Tampa that have placed on \"Amusement Today's\" award or nomination list, along with the highest ranking and year awarded or nominated. Busch Gardens Tampa has also been nominated for best landscaping in 1998 and 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Old World, as well as being cultivated and naturalized in the New World and on many oceanic islands.\n\nThe genus name comes from Greek words meaning \"dog-tooth\". The genus as a whole as well as its species are commonly known as Bermuda grass or dog's tooth grass.\n\n\nSeveral species now considered better suited to other genera, namely \"Arundo\", \"Bouteloua\", \"Brachyachne\", \"Chloris\", \"Cortaderia\", \"Ctenium\", \"Digitaria\", \"Diplachne\", \"Eleusine\", \"Enteropogon\", \"Eragrostis\", \"Eustachys\", \"Gynerium\", \"Leptochloa\", \"Molinia\", \"Muhlenbergia\", \"Phragmites\", \"Poa\", \"Spartina\", \"Tridens\", and \"Trigonochloa\".\nSome species, most commonly \"C. dactylon\", are grown as lawn grasses in warm temperate regions, such as the Sunbelt area of the United States where they are valued for their drought tolerance compared to most other lawn grasses. Propagation is by rhizomes, stolons, or seeds. In some cases it is considered to be a weed; it spreads through lawns and flower beds, where it can be difficult to kill with herbicides without damaging other grasses or plants. It is difficult to pull out because the rhizomes and stolons break readily, and then re-grow.\n\nIt is also noted for its common use on the surface of greens on golf courses, as well as football and baseball playing fields.\n\nRecent news reports claim that a Bermuda-derived F hybrid called \"Tifton 85\" suddenly started producing cyanide and killed a cattle herd in Texas, USA.\n\n"}

The two prisoners, Habibullah and Dilawar, were repeatedly chained to the ceiling and beaten, resulting in their deaths. Military coroners ruled that both the prisoners' deaths were homicides. Autopsies revealed severe trauma to both prisoners' legs, describing the trauma as comparable to being run over by a bus. Seven soldiers were charged in 2005.\n\nThe alleged torture and homicides took place at the military detention center known as the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, which had been built by the Soviets as an aircraft machine shop during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1980–1989). A concrete-and-sheet metal facility that was retrofitted with wire pens and wooden isolation cells, the center is part of Bagram Air Base in the ancient city of Bagram near Charikar in Parvan, Afghanistan.\n\nIn January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the main detention center at Bagram, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This was to comply with a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawyers had also demanded detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations at the center.\n\nHabibullah died on December 4, 2002. Several U.S. soldiers hit the chained man with so-called \"peroneal strikes,\" or severe blows to the side of the leg above the knee. This incapacitates the leg by hitting the common peroneal nerve. According to \"The New York Times\":\n\nWhen medics arrived, they found Habibullah dead.\n\nDilawar, who died on December 10, 2002, was a 22-year-old Afghan taxi driver and farmer who weighed 122 pounds and was described by his interpreters as neither violent nor aggressive.\n\nWhen beaten, he repeatedly cried \"Allah!\" The outcry appears to have amused U.S. military personnel. The act of striking him in order to provoke a scream of \"Allah!\" eventually \"became a kind of running joke,\" according to one of the MPs. \"People kept showing up to give this detainee a common peroneal strike just to hear him scream out 'Allah,'\" he said. \"It went on over a 24-hour period, and I would think that it was over 100 strikes.\"\n\nThe \"Times\" reported that:\n\nIn the documentary \"Taxi to the Dark Side\" (2007), directed by American filmmaker Alex Gibney, there was a claim that Dilawar was captured while driving through militia territory, not going past Bagram air base. The militia stopped him at a roadblock and transferred him to the U.S. Army for a monetary reward, claiming he was a terrorist.\n\nDr. Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani citizen educated in the United States as a neuroscientist, was suspected of the attempted assault and killing of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. She disappeared in 2003 with her three children. She was allegedly detained for five years at Bagram with her children; she was the only female prisoner. She was known to the male detainees as \"Prisoner 650.\" The media dubbed her as the \"Mata Hari of al-Qaida\" or the \"Grey Lady of Bagram.\" Yvonne Ridley says that Siddiqui is the \"Grey Lady of Bagram\" – a ghostly female detainee, who kept prisoners awake \"with her haunting sobs and piercing screams\". In 2005 male prisoners were so agitated by her plight, Ridley said, that they went on hunger strike for six days. Siddiqui's family maintains that she was abused at Bagram.\n\nIn 2008 Aafia Siddiqui was tried in federal district court in Manhattan on charges of terrorism. She denounced the 2008 trial, saying, \"(an appeal would be) a waste of time. I appeal to God. \" According to reports, 12-year-old Ahmed (Dr Aafia's son) was transferred to his aunt Fauzia Siddiqui in September 2008 after years of being detained with his mother in a US military base in Afghanistan. Later a little girl named Fatima was dropped off at the home of Siddiqui's sister; the girl's DNA matched that of Ahmed (Dr Aafia's son). Pakistani Senator Talha Mehmood, chairman of the Pakistani Senate's Standing Committee on Interior, \"slammed the US for keeping the child in a military jail in a cold, dark room for seven years.\" The fate of Siddiqui's other son is unknown.\n\nMohamed immigrated to the U.K. from Ethiopia in 1994 and sought asylum. In 2001 he converted to Islam and travelled to Pakistan, followed by Afghanistan, to see if the Taliban-run Afghanistan was \"a good Islamic country\". U.S. authorities believed that he was a would-be bomber, who fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. Pakistani immigration officials arrested him at the airport in April 2002 before he returned to the U.K. Mohamed has said officials have used evidence gained through torture in sites in Pakistan, Morocco and Afghanistan between 2002 and 2004 before he was \"secretly rendered\" to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detention camp on Cuba. In October 2008, the U.S. dropped all charges against him. Mohamed was reported as being very ill as a result of a hunger strike in the weeks before his release. In February 2009 Mohamed was interviewed by Moazzam Begg, a fellow Bagram detainee and founder of CagePrisoners, an organization to help released detainees. Mohamad identified a photo of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui as the woman whom he and other male detainees had seen at Bagram, known as \"Prisoner 650.\"\n\nMohammed Sulaymon Barre, a Somali refugee who worked for a funds transfer company, described his Bagram interrogation as \"torture.\" Barre said he was picked up and thrown around the interrogation room when he wouldn't confess to a false allegation. He was put into an isolation chamber that was maintained at a piercingly cold temperature for several weeks and deprived of sufficient rations during this period. As a result of this treatment, his hands and feet swelled, causing him such excruciating pain that he could not stand up.\n\nZalmay Shah, a citizen of Afghanistan, alleges mistreatment during detention at Bagram air base. An article published in the May 2, 2007 issue of \"The New Republic\" contained excerpts from an interview with Zalmay Shah. He said he had originally cooperated closely with the Americans. He had worked with an American he knew only as \"Tony\" in the roundup of former members of the Taliban. According to the article:\n\nZalmay Shah was eventually released. He said that Americans continue to ask for his cooperation, but he now declines.\n\nOthers include Mohammed Salim and Moazzam Begg.\n\nIn October 2004, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command concluded that there was probable cause to charge 27 officers and enlisted personnel with criminal offenses in the Dilawar case, ranging from dereliction of duty to maiming and involuntary manslaughter. Fifteen of the same soldiers were also cited for probable criminal responsibility in the Habibullah case. Seven soldiers have been charged so far. According to an article published in the October 15, 2004 \"The New York Times\" 28 soldiers were under investigation. Some of the soldiers were reservists in the 377th Military Police Company under the command of Captain Christopher M. Beiring. The rest were in the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion under the command of Captain Carolyn A. Wood.\n\nOn October 14, 2004, the Criminal Investigation Command forwarded its report from its investigation to the commanders of 28 soldiers.\n\nAs of November 15, 2005, 15 soldiers have been charged.\n\nSome interrogators involved in this incident were sent to Iraq and were assigned to Abu Ghraib prison. PFC Corsetti was fined and demoted while assigned to Abu Ghraib for not having permission to conduct an interrogation.\n\nA May 2005 editorial of \"The New York Times\" noted parallels between military behavior at Bagram and the later abuse and torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq:\n\nIn November 2001, Col. Morgan Banks, chief psychologist of the SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) program, was sent to Afghanistan. He worked for four months at Bagram. In early 2003, Banks issued guidance for the \"behavioral science consultants\" who helped to devise Guantánamo's interrogation strategy. He has emphatically denied having advocated use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees.\n\nThe United States government through the Department of State makes periodic reports to the United Nations Committee Against Torture. In October 2005, the report focused on pretrial detention of suspects in the War on Terrorism, including those held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and in Afghanistan. This particular report is significant as the first official response of the U.S. government to allegations of widespread abuse of prisoners in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay. The report denies the allegations.\n\nThe McCain amendment was an amendment to the United States Senate Department of Defense Authorization bill, commonly referred to as the \"Amendment on (1) the Army Field Manual and (2) Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading Treatment, amendment #1977\" and also known as the \"McCain Amendment 1977\". The amendment prohibited inhumane treatment of prisoners. The Amendment was introduced by Senator John McCain. On October 5, 2005, the United States Senate voted 90-9 to support the amendment, which was later signed into law by President George W. Bush.\n\nIn May 2010, the BBC reported about nine prisoners who \"told consistent stories of being held in isolation in cold cells where a light is on all day and night. The men said they had been deprived of sleep by US military personnel there.\" When the BBC sought information from the International Committee of the Red Cross about this, the ICRC revealed that it had been informed in August 2009 by US authorities that they maintained a second facility at Bagram, where detainees were held in isolation due to \"military necessity.\" This was an exception to the principle of allowing guaranteed access for all prisoners to the International Red Cross.\n\nThe 2007 documentary \"Taxi to the Dark Side\" (2007), directed by American filmmaker Alex Gibney, focuses on the murder of Dilawar by US troops at Bagram.\n\n\n"}

The company was founded in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1948 by Willi Studer. It initially became known in the 1950s for its professional tape recorders. In the 1990s the company moved into the manufacture of mixing consoles.\n\nManagement, sales, engineering, R&D and customer service were based in Regensdorf, Switzerland, until owners Harman International Industries closed down the Swiss entity in March 2018 transferring the now decentralised operation to China, Hungary, and the US. Manufacturing, marketing, and customer support were part of the Soundcraft facility in Potters Bar, England until Harman closed the Potters Bar facility in June 2016 and moved manufacturing and customer support to Hungary. Studer is currently a subsidiary of Harman International Industries which is owned by Samsung Electronics.\n\nWilli Studer began to make high-tension oscilloscopes in 1948. These products were in production until 1968. In March 1951, Studer introduced the Revox brand name subsidiary.\n\nIn 1990, Studer sold the Studer-Revox group to Motor-Columbus AG, including all subsidiary companies. In 1991, Motor-Columbus split the Studer-Revox Group into separate Studer, Revox and manufacturing-divisions. Motor-Columbus sold several subsidiaries and plants.\n\nThe extensive reorganization culminated in the sale of the Studer group to Harman International Industries in March 1994. The Revox group was excluded and sold to private investors. On March 17, 1994, Harman completed its acquisition and acquired from Motor-Columbus AG 100% of Studer-Revox AG.\n\nHarman paid 100 Swiss Francs (approximately US $70.00) for all of the issued and outstanding stock in Studer-Revox. Harman assumed post-acquisition indebtedness of Studer-Revox of approximately 23 million Swiss Francs (approximately US $16 million). Harman later moved some of its Studer business operations to England and merged them with operations of its Soundcraft subsidiary.\n\nWilli Studer died on March 1, 1996.\n\nIn 1949, Studer branched out into the audio business by modifying imported tape recorders from the United States. By 1950, they had developed their own line of tape recorders, named the Dynavox series. The company has built a variety of 2-track recorder models throughout its history for stereo recording.\n\nSeveral Studer components were sold under the Revox name, with slight modifications, at a lower price. The Revox variants were designed for consumer use, with features such as IR remote control, and the omission of balanced input/output sockets. The core circuitry of the two was otherwise substantially identical. One of the company's models was the Revox A77 recorder, which was introduced in 1967. \n\nStuder designed and produced multitrack recorders. Studer’s first multi-track machine, the model J37, was released in 1964. It recorded 4 tracks on one inch tape. A pair of J37s were used by The Beatles to record \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in 1967. Later analog Studer machines were built in 8, 16, and 24-track configurations using tape widths of up to two inches.\n\nSales of analog machines continued into the early 1990s, when they began to be replaced by digital recorders. In this period, Studer introduced the D820 and D827 multitrack models, which employed the Digital Audio Stationary Head standard. However, digital tape formats eventually fell from favor with the introduction of computerized hard disk drive recording systems and software products such as Pro Tools.\n\nIn the mid 1990s Studer started to develop digital mixing consoles. After introduction of OnAir 2000 with Touch'n Action user interface in 1997, the D950 was the first digital large frame desk Studer introduced in 1998. With Vista Series (Vista 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, V, and X) Studer launched in 2003 the Vistonics user interface with knobs-on-glass technology. Some older Vista models have been discontinued but Vista 1, 5, V, and X remain in production. Vista 5BE (Black Edition) is the latest model of this series continuing the use of x86 CPU technology replacing SHARC based DSP engines.\n\nThe Studer Vista 9M2 (launched September 2013) is a TV broadcast/live production console equipped with the patented Vistonics knobs-on-glass user interface and FaderGlow is used by TV broadcasters including the BBC, RAI, France TV, TV Globo, ABC, NRK, DR and many others. Studer also offers radio broadcast consoles with the Glacier control surfaces (replacing the now discontinued On Air 3000 and 2500 controllers) added to the remaining On Air range that includes the OnAir 1500.\n\n"}

His father was a solicitor and founder of the Plymouth law firm of Foot and Bowden. Isaac was also an active member of the Liberal Party, the Liberal MP for Bodmin before World War II and the Lord Mayor of Plymouth after the war. His elder siblings were barrister Sir Dingle Foot, QC (1905–1978), who subsequently became both a Liberal and Labour MP and Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon (1907–1990), who became Governor of Cyprus (1957–1960) and then the UK representative to the United Nations (1964–1970). His younger siblings were Margaret Elizabeth Foot (1911–1965), Michael Foot (1913–2010), a Labour MP, Cabinet Minister and Leader of the Opposition (1980–1983), Jennifer Mackintosh Highet (born 1916) and Christopher Isaac Foot (born 1917).\n\nHe married an American, Anne (Bailey Farr) in 1936 and they had a son and a daughter.\n\nHe was educated at Forres School, Swanage and then Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. He went on to read jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union in 1931, following in the steps of his elder brother Dingle (1928) and preceding his younger brother Michael (1933). After graduation he joined the family law firm before serving in the Wessex Division, reaching the rank of Major, and also on the HQ Staff of the 21st Army Group during World War II. After the war he rejoined the family law firm and subsequently became the senior partner there following the death of his father in 1960.\n\nFoot was considered by brother Michael as the best orator and the \"ablest member of the family\". He first stood as a Liberal candidate in a 1934 by-election, in the safe Conservative seat of Basingstoke, and ran again there in the 1935 general election. In both the 1945 and 1950 elections, he stood in Bodmin, being defeated by the Conservative Sir Douglas Marshall on both occasions. He remained in the Liberal Party during the long period of its post-war decline and was subsequently made a life peer on 29 November 1967 as Baron Foot, of Buckland Monachorum in the County of Devon.\n\nHe served as Chairman of the UK Immigrants Advisory Service from 1970-78 where he did not hesitate to criticise the Wilson Government for the inadequate fulfilment of their pledges to the persecuted Kenyan and Ugandan Asians. He was also a robust environmental defender of Dartmoor against the expansionist ambitions of Plymouth Council.\n\nHe died aged 90 on 11 October 1999, survived by his wife and children.\n\n"}

The lines, Routes 10, 11, 13, 34, and 36, collectively operate on about of route.\n\nSEPTA's Route 15, the Girard Avenue Line, is another streetcar line that is designated green on route maps but is not part of the subway–surface system.\n\nLike Boston's Green Line and San Francisco's Muni Metro, the SEPTA trolley line is the descendant of a pre-World War II streetcar system. Where Boston and San Francisco's systems use longer, articulated LRT vehicles, Philadelphia uses rigid vehicles roughly four inches longer than the PCC streetcar they replaced. The lines use Kawasaki K-Car LRVs delivered in 1981-82. The cars are similar to those on Routes 101 and 102, SEPTA's suburban trolley routes, which were delivered around the same time. However, the subway–surface cars are single-ended and use trolley poles, while the suburban lines use double ended cars and pantographs for power collection.\n\nStarting from their eastern terminus at 13th Street Station near City Hall, the trolleys loop around in a tunnel under City Hall before stopping at under Dilworth Park at 15th Street station and then realign back under Market Street.\n\nAll five routes also stop at 19th Street, 22nd Street, 30th Street, and 33rd Street, which are all underground stations. From 15th to 30th Streets, they run in the same tunnel as SEPTA's Market–Frankford Line, which runs express on the inner tracks while the trolleys utilize the outer ones.\n\nPassengers may transfer free of charge to the Market–Frankford Line at 13th, 15th, and 30th Streets, as well as to the Broad Street Line at 15th Street. Connections to the Regional Rail are also available via underground passageways connecting 13th and 15th Street stations to Suburban Station, one of the city's main commuter rail terminals.\n\nAfter traveling under the Schuylkill River, the trolley lines provide access to 30th Street Station, a passenger terminal located across the street from the trolley and rapid transit station. Connection is available to Regional Rail, many Amtrak services, and New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line. An underground passageway that connects these two stations is currently closed. The closure was due to passenger safety issues after a passenger attack in the 1990s. In 2016, the 30th Street Station District proposed overhauling both 30th Street Station's SEPTA and trolley stations including, by public demand, the reopening the tunnel that connects the two (currently separate) stations, thus ceasing the need for passengers to resurface, walk outside to cross the busy 30th Street, and then enter the other station. The timeline called for the tunnel overhaul to be part of Phase 1 and thus completed by 2020. \n\nAll routes then stop at 33rd Street, near Drexel University. After this stop, Route 10 diverts from the others and emerges from the tunnel at the 36th Street Portal just south of Market Street, then turns north onto 36th Street and then northwest along Lancaster Avenue and other surface streets. The other four lines make underground stops at 36th and Sansom streets and 37th and Spruce streets on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania before surfacing at the 40th Street Portal near Baltimore Avenue, heading southwest on surface streets.\n\nThe Route 11 line travels along Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia and Main Street in Darby. It crosses a CSX Transportation railroad line at grade, one of very few at-grade crossing between a trolley line and a major freight rail line in the United States. (Another belongs to the TECO streetcar system in Tampa, Florida.)\n\nAll five trolleys can be diverted onto auxiliary surface tracks west of the 40th Street Portal when tunnels are closed due to maintenance, an accident, or some other obstruction.\n\nTracks for Route 10 start at Lancaster Avenue (Route 10) and proceed southbound along 40th Street. At Market Street, the line connects to the Market–Frankford Line at its 40th Street station. The surface tracks continue southbound to Spruce Street, where they split either eastbound or westbound. Westbound tracks run to 42nd Street where they turn south to either Baltimore Avenue (Route 34), Chester Avenue (Route 13), or Woodland Avenue (Routes 11 and 36).\n\nTracks for the other four routes run northbound along 42nd Street, then turning east onto Spruce Street and then north onto 38th Street (US 13). From here, it travels to Filbert Street, then turning left and crossing the 40th Street tracks. When Filbert Street terminates at 41st Street, the tracks turn right, and head north until reaching Lancaster Avenue.\n\nAnother set of diversionary trolley tracks begin near the 49th Street Regional Rail station, connecting Chester Avenue to Woodland Avenue (where Routes 11 and 36 separate) by way of 49th Street.\n\nThe subway–surface lines are remnants of the far more extensive streetcar system that developed in Philadelphia after the arrival of electric trolleys in 1892. Several dozen traction companies were consolidated in 1902 into the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. The PRT funneled the West Philadelphia lines into subway tunnels as they approached the city center. After the PRT declared bankruptcy in 1939, it was reopened as the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), which was absorbed into SEPTA in 1968.\n\nIn October 2006, University of Pennsylvania's class of 1956 funded the construction of an innovative portal for one of the eastbound entrances of the 37th Street station: a replica of a Peter Witt trolley of the kind manufactured by J. G. Brill and Company from 1923–26. Operated by the Philadelphia Transportation Company, these trolleys brought university students to the campus and to Center City until 1956. Routes 11, 34 and 37 ran through the Penn campus on Woodland Avenue and Locust Streets for nearly 65 years. In 1956, the trolley route was buried to enable the university to unify its campus, with Woodland Avenue and Locust Street becoming pedestrian walkways.\n\nThe subway–surface lines has been operating \"Lifeline Service\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 2020, Route 34 was completely suspended, and the remaining routes are bypassing the , , , and stations in the Market Street tunnel. Service on Route 34 resumed on May 17, 2020.\n\nAll routes terminate at 15th Street station between 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. when 13th Street is closed. On Sunday evenings and during unexpected diversions, all routes are diverted to surface streets and terminate at 40th Street station. Former trolley routes, which have since been replaced with bus service, are shaded in gray.\n\n\n"}

Created by Charles Pratt, Jr. and Robert Guza, Jr., the character made her debut on the episode airing on October 1, 2003, portrayed by Kelly Monaco. Sam is the daughter of mob boss, Julian Jerome (William deVry) and powerful attorney Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn), born and given up for adoption when both were teenagers. She arrived in town as a con artist trying to reverse her family's bad luck by destroying the five lucky cards of the \"Dead Man's Hand.\" Upon her arrival she was characterized as a \"sexy bad girl, with a nose for intrigue.\" Since her introduction, the character has matured into a self-assured and confident woman, while still retaining traces of her adventuresome, bad girl ways.\n\nThe role of Sam was originated by former \"Baywatch\" star and \"Playboy's\" April 1997 Playmate of the Month, Kelly Monaco on October 1, 2003. Monaco, who had previously portrayed Livvie Locke on the ABC Daytime soap opera \"Port Charles\", was one of several performers from the cancelled soap to join the cast of a main daytime show. Monaco had also auditioned for ABC Daytime's \"All My Children\" as well as CBS Daytime's \"As the World Turns\", both of which were based in New York at the time, and Monaco's eagerness to stay on the West coast led to her ultimately signing with \"General Hospital\", based in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2005, Monaco joined the first season of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" and was the first champion of what turned into a multi-season competition.\n\nIn August 2009, a casting call was sent out to recast the role of Sam, leaving fans shocked by her possible departure. Despite rumors and speculation, Monaco's co-stars Steve Burton (Jason Morgan) and Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis Davis) denied she was departing from the show. Monaco herself dispelled the rumors, stating there was \"really no doubt\" she would renew her contract; it was merely standard procedure for ABC to release the casting call since she and the network had not signed off on a new contract by a set deadline.\n\nSamantha, also known as Sam is born on May 11, 1980 (Mother's Day) in Chatham, Maine to a 16-year-old Alexis Davidovitch (Nancy Lee Grahn). While at boarding school, Alexis' father, Mikkos Cassadine (John Colicos), forces her to give the child up and later forges documents to make Alexis believe the child is dead. \n\nSam is adopted by Cody McCall (Stanley Kamel) and his wife, Evelyn Bass, who choose adoption based on fear of having another mentally handicapped baby like their first child Danny (then Henri Lubatti). Cody is a con artist and his way of life forces Evelyn to leave when Sam is only three years old, taking Danny with her. Cody raises Sam on his own and teaches her the art of the con. When Sam is 17, she tracks down Evelyn in Bailey's Beach, South Carolina and is shocked to find Danny locked in the basement. When Sam helps Danny escape, he accidentally knocks a candle over that burns down the house, not knowing Evelyn was inside. Sam is arrested for arson, but gets out on bail and goes on the run with Danny to avoid being convicted for Evelyn's murder. A young Sam does her best to care for Danny but eventually resorts to extreme measures to pay his bills. Using skills she learned from Cody, Sam marries several wealthy men, and steals their money so she can care for her brother. During her last attempt at a con as \"Angela Monroe\", Sam finds herself in an abusive situation when her wealthy mark, Bill Monroe, discovers Sam's intentions, and attacks her. Sam ends up killing Bill in self-defense.\n\nSam first appears in Port Charles working with Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) to find the five lucky cards of the \"Dead Man's Hand.\" They have a brief affair, but when Jax's father dies he blames Sam, due to her scheming. Sam then has an affair with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), who is married, and becomes pregnant. His best friend Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) claims to be the child's father to keep Sonny's family together. Jason and Sam bond as Sam prepares to give birth and they decide to raise the child together. She decides to name her daughter Lila after Jason's grandmother, Lila Quartermaine (Anna Lee).\n\nSonny's daughter Kristina Davis (then Kali Rodriguez) is diagnosed with a blood disease, and Sam's daughter is proven to be a donor match. Kristina's mother, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn), begs Sam to induce labor two weeks early in order to donate her child's stem cells. Sam refuses, fearing it could hurt the baby. While arguing with Alexis, Sam collapses and Baby Girl McCall is stillborn. Sam is heartbroken over the loss of her daughter, and angry at Alexis, blaming her for her baby's death. Jason grieves with Sam and helps her through the aftermath; they fall in love, eventually getting engaged. Sam helps deliver a baby girl during a storm to a teenage mother named Bridget Daly. Bridget gives her baby to Sam, as she's unable to provide for it. Sam and Jason plan to adopt baby Hope. Bridget decides to keep the baby, leaving Sam devastated. Sam is accused of kidnapping Kristina soon after, and she and Jason try to find her to prove Sam's innocence. After Sonny's sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan, are also kidnapped, Sam is cleared of suspicion.\n\nJason and Sam are on a trip when they are kidnapped by Allegra Montenegro, played by Meg Bennett, the wife of Executive Producer at the time Robert Guza, Jr. Allegra wants Sam to pose as her daughter, Alicia, and marry Andrew Olsen to help the Montenegros regain their rich lifestyle. The storyline was received as an attempt to win ratings due to Monaco's recent success on the first season of \"Dancing with the Stars\", as Sam is forced to learn to ballroom dance in order to make Andrew believe she is really Alicia. When Andrew is killed, Sam is nearly sent to jail until Alicia is arrested for the murder. Sam is released, and she and Jason return to Port Charles.\n\nAs Sam settles back into her life, Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo) began stalking her. When several Port Charles residents are infected by the encephalitis plague, Danny dies; Sam blames Alexis since she received the last antidote over Danny. After Danny's death, Sam discovers that she was adopted, and her biological mother is Alexis. Sam keeps it to herself, wanting nothing to do with Alexis. However, when Sam is shot by Manny and near death, Jason tells Alexis the truth. Alexis pressures Jason into ending the relationship, but Sam tries to win him back. When all of her efforts fail, she and Alexis get into a heated argument, during which Alexis insults her and calls her derogatory names. Angry, Sam gets drunk and has a one-night stand with Alexis's husband, Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst). Ric later frames Sam for theft, forcing her to go on the run. She and Jason are ambushed by thugs, and Sam appears to kill Diego Alcazar (Ignacio Serricchio) as Kristina watches. Sam and Jason reconcile, and Sam hopes to have a child, but finds out she is infertile from her shooting.\n\nAfter Sam escapes during the Metro Court Hotel hostage crisis and warns the police, television producer Amelia Joffe (Annie Wersching) hires her as the host of the new talk show, \"Everyday Heroes\". However, Amelia is actually looking for revenge on Sam for killing her father, Bill Monroe. Sam does her best to keep her past from coming out and she begins lying to Jason. Meanwhile, Sam learns that Elizabeth Spencer's (Rebecca Herbst) son, Jake, is actually Jason's son. Sam witnesses Jake get kidnapped, but doesn't say anything. After Jake is rescued, Jason finds out about Sam and Jake, and they began a 2-year break up; she also hires actors to scare Elizabeth and Jake in the park. Sam fakes a rescue, but Jason finds out Sam hired the gunmen; he threatens to kill Sam for her out of control actions.\n\nSam seduced Elizabeth's husband Lucky Spencer (then Greg Vaughan) to get revenge on Jason and Liz, but they eventually fall in love. However, once Lucky finds out about Sam's part in Jake's kidnapping, they split up. Meanwhile, Sam is stalked and injured by the Text Message Killer, who is later revealed to be an alive Diego Alcazar. While fleeing from Diego she is struck by a car driven by Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson), who is under the influence of alcohol. Sam forgives Monica, helping her get a lenient sentence to rehab. When Sam and Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson) start their own investigative agency, Jason and Sam begin to grow close again. Sam realizes that a teenage Kristina is becoming rebellious and tries to help her. When Claudia Zacchara (Sarah Joy Brown) has an accident, Sam worries that Kristina is responsible; Jason tells her he thinks it was Michael. When the two teens run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason chase after them. Sam is kidnapped by Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roché), but rescued by Jason, and the two locate Michael and Kristina. After returning to Port Charles, Sam and Jason get back together for the first time in 2 years. Jason is stalked by crazed artist Franco (then James Franco), who kidnaps and threatens Sam to get to Jason. Sam shares with Kristina her experience of being in an abusive relationship after Kristina is beaten by her boyfriend, Kiefer Bauer (Christian Alexander).\n\nAfter Michael is sent to prison, Sam struggles with Jason going to prison so he can protect Michael. Jason is eventually released, and later that year must protect Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil) from the European crime boss The Balkan (Daniel Benzali). During Sonny and Brenda's wedding, Sam is nearly killed in a car bomb set for Brenda, but she survives. Sam has reconstructive surgery so she and Jason can have a baby. Sam and Jason soon become engaged and get married. During their honeymoon, Sam becomes pregnant with Jason's child. Franco shows up and drugs them both, locks Jason in a room, and forces him to watch as he supposedly rapes Sam. Sam discovers she's pregnant after returning home, and a paternity test establishes Jason as the father.\n\nJason's cousin Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) tells Sam that Franco and Jason are fraternal twin brothers, and a new DNA test shows Franco is the father of Sam's baby. Jason is unsure if he can love Franco's child, and Sam moves out. Sam gives birth to a baby boy with the help of John McBain (Michael Easton), but she passes out and is unaware that Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) and Heather switch the baby with the stillborn son of Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano). Sam wakes up, and believes her son is dead. The pain and grief overwhelms her, and she decides to file for a divorce from Jason. Sam continues to confide in John, and they share a flirtation. Jason figures out the truth about Sam's son, but by the time he figures it out, Heather has kidnapped the baby. Jason and Sam reunite and rescue their son, naming him Daniel Edward Morgan. The two reconcile, but Jason disappears after being shot by Cesar Faison (Anders Hove); he is presumed dead, but Sam remains determined to find him. After Jason disappears, Sam finds out that Jason is Danny's biological father.\n\nSam eventually realizes that Jason is not coming back and tries to move on. Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) comes to town, and claims John is a vampire named Caleb Morley. Sam believes Lucy is insane, until a woman named Alison Barrington (Erin Hershey) is murdered, and her son, Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler), claims John is the murderer. Sam is kidnapped by Caleb, but rescued by John, Rafe, and Lucy. Sam later becomes a foster mother to Rafe. Sam meets Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton), Rafe's uncle, who decides to get physical custody of Rafe from Sam. Though the court sides with Silas, he lets Rafe stay with Sam. Meanwhile, Sam finds out that Danny has leukemia, and needs treatment. Silas assists in Danny's recovery, but determines Danny will need a bone marrow transplant. When no one is a match, Sam asks Alexis about her biological father. Alexis admits she doesn't know who Sam's father is, because she never met him again. Alexis undergoes hypnosis to help Sam, and finds out Sam's father's name is \"Julian.\" Sam finds a bone marrow match for Danny to Derek Wells (William DeVry), and Danny recovers. Alexis figures out that Sam's father is Julian Jerome, a mobster presumed dead. Sam and Silas start dating, and Sam finds out that \"Derek\" is actually Julian, who plans to take over Sonny's territory. When Sonny threatens to kill him, Julian uses Danny as leverage to stay alive, in case Danny suffers a setback. Sam is disgusted with her father's actions, and writes him off.\n\nRafe died after being taken off life support following an accident, and Silas accused Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson), Rafe's doctor, of deliberately killing him because Rafe caused a car accident that led to the death of Patrick's son. Sam knew Patrick didn't kill Rafe, which led to her and Silas breaking up. Sam befriended \"Jake Doe\" (Billy Miller), an amnesiac patient at the hospital who had facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. She also started a relationship with Patrick. After Faison is arrested, Sam was taken hostage by a gunman who helped Faison escape. Sam wanted to find the gunman, and realized it was Jake. Though he denied the accusation, Jake was arrested, and Sam confronted him. Jake realized that he had been brainwashed by Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers), and Sam's accusations were correct. Sam forgave him, and helped him get a job and figure out his real identity. Sam got engaged to Patrick, but right after, she found out that \"Jake\" is actually Jason. Sam reeled from the news, trying to process what to do. Jason went to Cassadine Island to confront Helena, and Sam followed him there. Helena continued to taunt Jason, and Sam lashed out, furious at Helena for keeping Jason from her and Danny. Helena retaliated by cursing Sam before supposedly dying. Sam returned to Port Charles, where Patrick realized that Sam was still in love with Jason, and broke off their engagement. Sam was heartbroken, but accepted his decision.\n\nJason and Sam began to reconnect, as Jason started to experience memory flashes while spending time with Sam. When Elizabeth's house was broken into, Jason asked for Sam's help investigating. Sam figured out that Elizabeth and Jason's son, Jake, was responsible. Sam ended up getting seriously injured when she discovered the truth, but Jason was able to rescue her. Though the two reconnected, Sam decided to get a divorce, wanting to not pressure Jason to remember their past. Jason agreed, and the two divorced, but started dating. Jason ends up recovering his memories after getting into an accident, and reunites with Sam. Sam went into hiding with Jason after Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) disappeared, and Jason was accused of killing him. She and Jason figured out that Nikolas faked his death, and tracked him down to Cassadine Island. Before they could bring Nikolas back, they were taken hostage by Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart). Sam and Jason escaped, and managed to free the other hostages. They returned to Port Charles, and cleared Jason's name. Soon after, Sam found out she was pregnant, and was thrilled until she found out that she could have been exposed to malaria. Sam shares her news with Jason; despite the potential risk to the baby, Jason is elated. He proposes to Sam, and they get engaged again. Sam learns she is malaria free, assuring her the baby is healthy thanks to their new friend Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton). She and Jason get married again.\n\nSam eventually starts to bond with Julian and gives her blessing for him to marry Alexis. However, she disowns him again after he lets Alexis get arrested for a crime he committed, then tries to kill her when Alexis exonerates herself. He's put on trial for his crimes, but ends up getting acquitted. Soon after, Julian's car explodes, killing Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig). Sam and Jason investigate; at first, they suspect Sonny, but Jason finds out he's innocent. He and Sam try to find the real killer to prove Sonny's innocence. The clues lead Sam to discover that Morgan was killed by Olivia St. John (Tonja Walker), Julian's sister. Olivia kidnaps Sam and when she tries to escape, she is severely injured by Olivia and left unconscious. Sam survives, but ends up going into labor. Jason finds her, and helps Sam give birth to Emily Scout Morgan. They're immediately taken to the hospital, where Sam ends up in a coma after surgery; she wakes up and recovers\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2017, Jason and Sam began to kiss as 2018 began, but Drew interrupts them. Jason wanted to be happy together with Sam, but he learned that she loves Drew. While although she loved Jason, Sam and Drew decided to start 2018 by getting engaged and decided to get married. But first, Jason and Sam agreed to get a divorce, and they officially divorced, and making her happy with Drew, then on January 22, Drew and Sam were married, and they became co-owners of Aurora Media since they got married for love and business. In early March, in the aftermath of the earthquake, Sam revealed her feelings to her ex-husband Jason that she still loves him, then later in the month, Drew heard her that she had developed feelings for Jason in love, and they decided to be separated by having her dumped him for good. In May 2018, she began a partnership with Curtis by being private investigators for McCall & Ashford.\n\nWhen the character is introduced, Sam is described as \"an adventurous woman trying to reverse her family's bad fortune\", who would immediately interact with character Jasper Jacks (Rademacher). She is independent and scheming. \"Soaps In Depth\" named the character on their list of the 50 naughtiest soap opera vixens in 2009. When she first arrives in town, she is portrayed as a con artist and bad girl, who knew how to get what she wanted. The motivation behind the character's bad girl ways were revealed, when it was discovered that she was raised on the road by a con artist father, Cody McCall, and used cons to provide for her mentally handicapped older brother, Danny McCall. Sam grows close to Jason Morgan during her pregnancy with the child of Sonny Corinthos. Co-star Burton (Jason) later explained: \"It's been a long journey for Jason and Sam. When they first got together, it wasn't really supposed to be that they got together. He was kind of helping her out with her pregnancy. After that whole time they fell in love.\" When the couple broke up in 2008, Monaco said to \"Soap Opera Digest\", \"I feel Sam and Jason was so abruptly ended without any explanation, really, as to the coldness that was so one-sided [on Jason's part]. Of course, Jake came into play, but I felt like Jason and Sam were always strong enough to overcome.\" Sam begins a relationship with Lucky Spencer to get back at Elizabeth. Monaco describes the progression of the relationship to \"Soap Opera Digest\", \"In the beginning it was very calculated and manipulative. Eventually, it turned genuine. [...] finally, she found someone who is trustworthy.\"\n\nThe revelation of Alexis Davis (Grahn) as Sam's biological mother was a turning point in the development of the character. The two characters had a rocky past filled with disdain, but the shocking revelation of their kinship forced the characters to co-exist. The newly formed mother-daughter relationship was very antagonistic in its early stages, but over time the two characters were able to reconcile and put the hate of their past behind them. Now the two characters share a close mother-daughter bond. The revelation of Alexis and Sam as mother and daughter was named the best revelation of the decade by \"SOAPnet\". The unveiling of Alexis as Sam's mother led to widespread speculation as to the identity of Sam's biological father. For years, great fanfare was generated around this mystery in anticipation for the revelation of his identity. \n\nSeven years after Alexis was revealed as Sam's mother, \"General Hospital\" began dropping hints that they were ready to tackle the highly anticipated story of Sam's father. In 2013 \"General Hospital\" head-writer, Ron Carlivati addressed the ongoing mystery of Sam's father in an interview with \"TV Guide's\" Michael Logan. Widespread speculation about the identity of Sam's father was reignited when it was rumored that \"General Hospital\" was looking for a \"name actor\" to cast in the role of Sam's father. Rumors began to circulate naming Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan), Blackie Parrish (John Stamos) and Dr. Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) as potential candidates for Sam's father; Lindstrom having previously worked opposite Monaco as her father on the soap opera \"Port Charles.\" Another rumor emerged that veteran soap actor, Peter Reckell, who played Bo Brady on the NBC soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\" from 1983-2012, would be joining \"General Hospital\" in the role of Evan Jerome. It was widely speculated that Reckell was cast to play Sam's father, linking her to the Jerome crime family that was prominent on \"General Hospital\" in the 1980s. However, after weeks of speculation, Reckell addressed the rumors stating that he wasn't going back to \"Days of Our Lives\" or joining any other soap. In July 2013, ABC unveiled its latest \"General Hospital\" promo which showed Sam asking Alexis for the identity of her father. In the storyline, Sam's young son Danny has leukemia and they are trying to find as many potential bone marrow donors as possible.\n\nFollowing the promo's release, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis), took to her Twitter account to engage fans in a guessing game as to the identity of Sam's father. During the week the promo was released, it was announced that actor William deVry, who formerly starred on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" as Storm Logan, and \"All My Children\" as Michael Cambias was joining \"General Hospital.\" There were reports that deVry had taped scenes with Maura West's Ava Jerome, leading to speculation that deVry could be joining the show as a Jerome and as Sam's father. deVry made his debut on July 30, 2013 under the alias Derek Wells, and it was soon revealed that he was actually Julian Jerome—son of mob boss Victor Jerome who was head of the Port Charles mob in the 1980s. Soon after the real identity of deVry's character was discovered, it was confirmed that deVry had been cast as Sam's father, when it was revealed that Sam's biological father is crime figure Julian Jerome.\n\nWhen Monaco originated the role of Sam, her performance was well received by viewers and the network. In 2006, Monaco was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Sam. She also co-hosted the Daytime Emmy Awards that same year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1914203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914203", "title": "Columbia College Chicago", "text": "Columbia College Chicago\n\nColumbia College Chicago is a private college specializing in arts and media disciplines and located in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1890, it has 6,195 students pursuing degrees in more than 60 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.\n\nColumbia College Chicago is the host institution of several affiliated educational, cultural, and research organizations, including the Center for Black Music Research, the Center for Book and Paper Arts, the Center for Community Arts Partnerships, the Dance Center of Columbia College Chicago, and the Museum of Contemporary Photography.\n\nColumbia College Chicago is not affiliated with Columbia University, Columbia College Hollywood, or any other Columbia College in the United States.\n\nColumbia College Chicago was founded in 1890 as the Columbia School of Oratory by Mary A. Blood and Ida Morey Riley, both graduates of the Monroe Conservatory of Oratory (now Emerson College), in Boston, Massachusetts. Anticipating a strong need for public speaking at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas, Blood and Riley were inspired to open their school in the exposition city, Chicago, and adopt the exposition's name. Blood and Riley became the College's first co-presidents, until Riley died in 1901; Blood served in this capacity until her death in 1927. The women established a co-educational school that \"should stand for high ideals, for the teaching of expression by methods truly educational, for the gospel of good cheer, and for the building of sterling good character\" in the Stevens' Art Gallery Building, 24 East Adams Street.\n\nThe school ran as a sole proprietary business from 1890 to 1904 when the school became incorporated by the state of Illinois. On May 5, 1904, the school incorporated itself again in order to change its name to the Columbia College of Expression, adding coursework in teaching to the curriculum.\n\nWhen Blood died in 1927, George L. Scherger assumed the office of presidency after serving as a former member on the Board of Directors. Under his leadership, Scherger signed the paperwork at the Board's annual meeting on April 14, 1928, to change the School's name to the Mary A. Blood School of Speech Arts. However, by April 30, 1928, the school reverted its name to the Columbia College of Expression by the Board of Directors, George L. Scherger, Herman H. Hegner, and Erme Rowe Hegner. During Scherger's presidency, the College became an official sister institution with the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, a family-run school centered on training its students for teaching kindergarten. As the president of the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, Bertha Hofer Hegner assumed the role as the fourth president of Columbia College of Expression in 1929 when Scherger resigned to become an assistant pastor of St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nHegner served as the institutions' head, although due to illness, her son, Herman Hofer Hegner served as acting president of the institutions from 1930 until 1936. By 1934, College curriculum also focused on the growing field of radio broadcasting. Herman Hofer Hegner hired Norman Alexandroff, a radio programmer, in 1934 to develop a radio curriculum for the Colleges as both institutions were suffering financially. When Bertha Hofer Hegner retired in 1936 due to health reasons, she was made president emeritus of the institutions and Herman Hofer Hegner became the institutions' official president.\n\nDuring Herman Hofner Hegner's presidency, the Columbia College of Expression was advertised under different names including, Columbia College of Speech and Drama, the Radio Institute of Columbia School of Speech and Drama, and Columbia College of Speech, Drama, and Radio. However, the College was never incorporated under any of these names by the state of Illinois. As the radio program gained prominence, Alexandroff was named as the Vice President of the Columbia College of Expression and became a member on the Board of Directors at both institutions by 1937.\n\nThe college left its partnership with the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, named Norman Alexandroff as its president, and filed the Columbia College of Expression as a not for profit corporation on December 3, 1943. On February 5, 1944, the College re-filed as a not for profit corporation and changed its name to Columbia College. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the college broadened its educational base to include television, journalism, marketing, and other mass-communication areas. Alexandroff also oversaw the development of the extension campuses of the School, Columbia College Pan-Americano in Mexico City, Mexico, and Columbia Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California. Both of these campuses became independent of its parent in the late 1950s. Prosperity was short lived, however, and by 1961, the college had fewer than 200 students and a part-time faculty of 25.\n\nNorman Alexandroff remained the president of the College until his death on May 26, 1960, and his son, Mirron (Mike) Alexandroff, assumed the role of President by 1961. Mike Alexandroff had worked at the College since 1947 and as president, he created a liberal arts college with a \"hands-on minds-on\" approach to arts and media education with a progressive social agenda. He established a generous admissions policy so that qualified high school graduates could attend college courses taught by some of the most influential and creative professionals in Chicago. For the next thirty years, Alexandroff worked to build the college into an urban institution that helped to change the face of higher education.\n\nWith this renewed focus on building its academic program, the institution was awarded full accreditation in 1974 from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1984, received accreditation for its graduate programs. In 1975, when the college's enrollment exceeded 2,000, it purchased its first real estate, the building at 600 South Michigan Avenue (the building is now known as the Alexandroff Campus Center). At the time of Alexandroff's retirement in 1992, the college served 6,791 students and owned or rented more than of instructional, performance, and administrative space.\n\nFrom 1992 until 2000, John B. Duff, former commissioner of the Chicago Public Library and former chancellor of the Massachusetts Board of Regents of Higher Education, served as the college's president. On October 28, 1997, the college changed its name to Columbia College Chicago and the institution continued to expand its educational programs and add to its physical campus by purchasing available buildings in the South Loop. This played a significant part in its presence in the South Loop and downtown Chicago. Today, the college's campus occupies almost two dozen buildings and utilizes over 2.5 million square feet.\n\nIn 2000, Dr. Warrick L. Carter became the college's president. An educator, jazz composer, and performing artist, Carter joined the college from The Walt Disney Company, where he spent four years as director of entertainment arts. Previously, he had spent 12 years at Berklee College of Music in Boston, one of the world's-largest independent schools of music, where he served as dean of faculty and then provost and vice president of academic affairs.\n\nThrough 2010, under his leadership, the college created new student-based initiatives such as Manifest, the annual urban arts festival celebrating Columbia's graduating students, and ShopColumbia, a store where students can showcase and sell their work on campus; partnered with local universities to construct the University Center; purchased new campus buildings; added new curricula; and oversaw the college's first newly constructed building, the Media Production Center.\n\nRecently, the college has a growing program of international exchanges, including associations with Dublin Institute of Technology, the University of East London, and the Lorenzo de' Medici Italian International Institute. Through the vast diversity of students and graduates, the school brings a rich vision and a multiplicity of voices to American culture, encouraging students to \"author the culture of their times\".\n\nHowever, Columbia has not been exempt from internal and external criticism in recent years. During the 2011–12 school year, the college administration attempted to implement a set of sweeping changes to the college's curriculum, staffing policies, and overall institutional structure, through an initiative dubbed Blueprint | Prioritization. As the specifics of the changes and cutbacks came to light over the course of the school year, students and faculty from affected departments and majors vocalized their opposition to the cutbacks by staging protests during administrative meetings, mic-checking Interim Provost Louise Love during an open hearing about the proposed cutbacks, and circulating petitions calling for certain decisions, and even the entire process, to be reversed, citing \"union busting\" practices, consistent tuition hikes, and frequent, unexplained personnel changes across the college.\n\nPress coverage and local awareness of the college's troubles surrounding Prioritization increased rapidly after Deanna Issacs, a reporter for the Chicago Reader, was shut out of President Warrick Carter's annual State of the College Address to the student body, which had been advertised as \"open to the public.\" During the meeting, at which the President had been questioned extensively by students about cutbacks and tuition hikes, Carter appeared to lose his temper at one point, aggressively telling a student to \"shut up,\" in his response to a question about his salary, which exceeds $400,000 per year. In addition to the Reader, the grievances voiced over the Blueprint | Prioritization cutbacks received coverage in the \"Chicago Tribune\", the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", and \"Time Out Chicago\".\n\nAs of September 2012, most of the proposed changes from Prioritization had yet to be implemented. Programs and departments that were at one point or another slated for cuts include the Center for Black Music Research, the Chicago Jazz Ensemble, the Ellen Stone Belic Institute for the Study of Women and Gender in the Arts and Media, the Fiction Writing Department (whose Chair was let go without explanation after 20+ years of service in April 2011, only to be reinstated just months later after a student uproar over the firing), the college's recycling program, which employed student workers to collect refuse, and the top-10 ranked Cultural Studies program, one of the few standalone undergraduate programs of its kind in the nation.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, President Warrick Carter announced he would retire a year earlier than expected, stepping down at the end of the 2012–13 academic year.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, Dr. Kwang-Wu Kim became Columbia College's 10th president. Dr. Kim holds a Doctorate of Musical Arts and an Artist Diploma from the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University, where he studied with the legendary pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher and served as Fleisher's teaching associate.\n\nIn 2013, Columbia College Chicago was ranked 13th best Film School in the country by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nColumbia College Chicago is consistently ranked in The Hollywood Reporter's top 25 schools for music composition. In 2018, Hollywood reporter ranked Columbia College Chicago at number 13.\n\nMary A. Blood, 1890–1927\n\nIda Morey Riley, 1890–1901\n\nRev. Dr. George L. Scherger, 1927–1929\n\nBertha Hofer Hegner, 1929–1936\n\nHerman Hofer Hegner, 1936–1944\n\nNorman Alexandroff, 1944–1960\n\nMirron (Mike) Alexandroff, 1961–1992\n\nDr. John B.

The college owns sixteen academic, gallery/performance, administrative, and student residential buildings, and leases additional office and student residential space in four buildings. Most of the campus is contained in an area bounded by Ida B. Wells Drive, State Street, Roosevelt Road, and Michigan Avenue. Many of Columbia's buildings were built in the early 20th century and were acquired by the school as it expanded.\n\nThe college also operates an intensive five-week Semester in Los Angeles program on the premises of Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California, for upper-level (80+ credit hours completed, 3.0 GPA) Cinema Art & Science, Television, Communication and Media Innovation, Music, and Business & Entrepreneurship students.\n\nLocated at 600 S. Michigan Avenue, Columbia College's Main Building was built in 1906–07 by Christian A. Eckstorm, an architect popular for his industrial and warehouse designs, to serve as the headquarters of the International Harvester Company. 600 S. Michigan was a modern skyscraper of its era, built with a steel skeleton, high-speed elevators, electric light, the most advanced mechanical systems available and a floor plan designed to maximize natural light for all of its interior office spaces. The 15-story brick-clad building with classical stone detailing has an Art Deco lobby that retains much of its original marble. In 1937 the building was purchased by the Fairbanks-Morse Company, makers of railroad locomotives, farm equipment and hydraulic systems. It was acquired by Columbia College in 1975. In its early years as the home of Columbia, it was adaptively reused to house classrooms, the library, darkrooms, studios, and an auditorium. When the campus expanded through the acquisition of other buildings, especially after 1990, some of these functions, such as the greatly expanded library, were moved to other locations, and the spaces were again adapted for new uses. The building continues to serve as the administrative center of the College, and houses the Museum of Contemporary Photography on its first two floors, along with the 180-seat Ferguson Memorial Theater, photography darkrooms, three professional television studios, film/video editing facilities, and classrooms.\n\nThe 33 East Ida B Wells Drive (formerly 33 East Congress) Building was built in 1925–26 by noted Chicago architect Alfred S. Alschuler, who designed the 1927 Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The seven-story brick and terra cotta \"Congress-Wabash Building\" was commissioned by Ferdinand W. Peck, Jr., a real estate developer, and initially housed a bank, offices, and recreation rooms that included dozens of pool tables. A national billiards championship was held here in 1938. By the 1940s, the building was known by the name of its major tenant, the Congress Bank. In the 1980s, it became the home of MacCormac College. Columbia leased space in the building starting in 1997 and purchased the structure in 1999. It currently houses administrative offices, classroom space and the college's radio station (WCRX 88.1 FM). The building is home to Columbia's American Sign Language-English Interpretation, Audio Arts & Acoustics, Journalism and Radio departments.\n\n623 South Wabash Avenue was built in 1895, designed by Solon S. Beman, architect of the industrial town of Pullman, one of the 19th century's largest, most complex, and globally famous planned industrial communities for the Pullman Palace Car Company. The ten-story 623 South Wabash building was originally built for the Studebaker Brothers Carriage Company of South Bend, Indiana as its Chicago regional office and warehouse facility. It was later owned by the Brunswick Corporation, makers of wood furnishings and built-in furniture for libraries, universities and a variety of public commercial and governmental facilities. By the late 19th century Brunswick became specialists in designing such entertainment furnishings as bars, billiards tables, and bowling alleys for drinking establishments nationwide. Subsequent owners are unknown. The building was acquired by Columbia in 1983 and now houses classrooms, academic offices, a computerized newsroom, sciences laboratories, art studios and two public gallery spaces. The building is also home to Anchor Graphics and ShopColumbia, a retail venue that sells the work of Columbia students and alumni artists, musicians, filmmakers etc. exclusively.\n\n624 South Michigan Avenue was built by Christian A. Eckstorm in 1908 as an eight-story building to house the Chicago Musical College, a concern headed by Florenz Ziegfeld Sr., father of Ziegfeld Follies producer Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. A seven-story addition was designed and built in 1922 by Alfred Alschuler. The building was renamed the Blum Building and housed the studios of a dance school and boutique women's clothiers. Tenants in the building in the 1920s included Augustus Eugene Bournique's dancing schools and two select women's clothiers, Stanley Korshak's Blackstone Shop and Blum's Vogue. Brick clad with classical detailing, this 15-story building retains its period marble and brass lobby. Columbia College acquired the building in 1990 and it now houses the College's five-story library, classrooms, departmental offices, student and faculty lounges and the College's bookstore\n\n1104 South Wabash Avenue, built in 1891, is on the City of Chicago Landmarks (1996) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1980). Built by William LeBaron Jenney, acknowledged as the inventor of the skyscraper for his fire-proofed metal skeleton-frame designs, the Ludington Building represents his continuing experimentation as the first entirely terra cotta-clad skyscraper. The Ludington Building is also a rare survivor, one of only two extant loft buildings in Chicago built by Jenney.\n\nThis eight-story, steel-frame building, boasting one of the finest examples of a terra-cotta clad façade, was commissioned by Mary Ludington Barnes for the American Book Company (1890), which was owned by her husband, Charles Barnes. At the time, Chicago was a national center for the publishing industry, as demonstrated by this building and many others, particularly those on Chicago's Printers Row, and including the former Lakeside Press Building owned by Columbia College. The American Book Company built the building to house its offices, printing presses, packaging and shipping operations. Its frame was built to withstand the weight and vibrations of the presses, which were originally located on the fourth through sixth floors, and to accommodate the anticipated eight-story addition that was never built. Its status as a manufacturing facility determined its form as a loft building, with a practical and efficient interior that had few elegant original elements. Its location, between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Grand Central Station at Harrison and Wells Streets and the Illinois Central Railroad's Central Station at Michigan Avenue and Roosevelt Road, made it ideal for the distribution of the company's products. \n\nThe Ludington Building was owned by descendants of its original owners until 1960, although it was occupied by many different tenants, including the Pepsodent toothpaste company in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1960, it was sold to Warshawsky and Company, an autoparts firm, for use as a storage facility. The college purchased the building from Warshawsky in 1999. The Ludington currently houses the school's Center for Book and Paper Arts, a portion of the Film and Video Department, the Glass Curtain Gallery and the Conaway Multicultural Center.\n\n1014–16 South Michigan Avenue was built in 1912 by Christian A. Eckstorm A red brick 4-story building with terra cotta detailing, this structure was erected by a developer as a speculative commercial building. During its first 30 years, it housed offices for a shingle distributor, a lumber company and an electrical parts manufacturer. In 1941, the building was rehabilitated for the Sherwood Conservatory of Music, founded in 1895 by William Hall Sherwood, a piano virtuoso, teacher and composer. The school's most famous alumna may be the comedian Phyllis Diller, who was a piano student at the Sherwood School in the 1930s but did not graduate. The building was acquired by Columbia College Chicago in 2007 and now houses the school's music department. The artistic, cultural and performance education tradition of this building, as it was adaptively reused since the 1940s, is continued today in the programs of the Music Center of Columbia College.\n\n72 East 11th Street was built in 1929 by Holabird & Root, architects of notable Chicago skyscrapers such as the Chicago Board of Trade, the Palmolive Building and the 333 North Michigan Avenue Building. 72 East 11th Street, a six- story, limestone-clad Art Deco building, was originally owned by the Chicago Women's Club and housed the organization's meeting rooms, offices and a theater. Rich in history, it was the site for rallies in support of women's voting rights, efforts on behalf of compulsory education laws and fund raising for scholarships at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and a women's dormitory at the University of Chicago. Subsequent owners and uses are unknown. Acquired by Columbia in 1980 as the school's Theater Center, it currently houses a renovated 400-seat theater, classrooms, and space for film and photography studios.\n\nThe Dance Center of Columbia College Chicago is one of the region's education centers.\n\nPresenting companies have included: \nMerce Cunningham Dance Company,\nLucky Plush Productions,\nCloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan,\nKoosil-ja/danceKUMIKO,\nJUMP RHYTHM Jazz Project,\nTroika Ranch,\nWayne McGregor Random Dance, and\nHedwig Dances.\n\n1306 S. Michigan Avenue, the Dance Center Building, was built in 1930 by architect Anker S. Graven. This sleek four-story Art Deco building, clad in limestone, was erected as the Paramount Publix Corporation as a film exchange, a venue for the presentation of films to the independent cinema operators throughout the Midwest who could rent them for exhibition at their theaters. The studio occupied the building up to about 1950, when it was taken over by the Equitable Life Assurance Company. In the 1970s it was known as the Seafarers International Union Building. The City of Chicago took possession of it in a tax sale in 1984, and used it for the Health Department's Environmental Health Clinic. The building was acquired by Columbia College in 1999 for use as the school's Dance Center. After extensive interior renovation and adaptation, the Dance Center opened its state-of-the-art educational and public performance facilities in the fall of 2000.\n\nPrior to the relocation to Michigan Avenue, the Dance Center was located at 4730 North Sheridan Road in a former movie theater in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago. The first floor housed the department office, lobby, dressing rooms, and the \"main space\", the primary dance studio. The second floor, accessed via a metal staircase in the back of the main space, held the ballet studio, the T'Chi room and music recording rooms.\n\nLocated at 1600 South State Street, the Media Production Center (MPC) was completed in 2010 and was the college's first new-construction building in its history. Designed by Studio Gang Architects, the 35,500-square-foot facility serves students in the Cinema Art + Science, Interactive Arts & Media, and Television programs. It contains two film production soundstages, a motion-capture studio, digital labs, animating suites, a fabrication shop, and classrooms. It received a 2010 Citation of Merit in the Distinguished Building category from the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects. It has also received LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nColumbia College Chicago signed onto the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment in 2010. The college has met ACUPCC reporting deadlines that included submitting a formal Climate Action Plan and updating their Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The college has yet to set a climate neutrality date with the ACUPCC.\n\nA Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory was completed in June 2011. The results show total CO2 equivalent emissions of 19,381.1 metric tonnes for the baseline year of 2010.\n\nThe GHG Inventory was updated in May 2013. The total C02e emissions were 9,399 metric tonnes for the 2012 fiscal year. This reduction was due in part to the inclusion of purchased Renewable Energy Credits to offset emissions generated from purchased electricity. In conducting the GHG update, new methodologies were employed, emissions from purchased paper were used, and commuting data was collected from a streamlined transit survey.\n\nIn 2011, the college hired the company Sustainametrics to complete the college's Sustainability Roadmap.\n\nIn 2012, the college decided to consolidate the Recycling Program into a sustainability-based program. The position of Recycling Manager became Sustainability Manager. Other part-time staff from the Recycling Program moved under the Sustainability Manager's direction into this new sustainability program. These part-time positions are responsible for maintaining the campus green spaces and managing diversion efforts such as compost and atypical recycling (batteries, technotrash).\n\nCampus recycling and waste collection is coordinated by its janitorial services contractor.\n\nColumbia College has at least $8 million invested in the oil, gas and coal industry. Ken Gotsch, the former CFO of Columbia, reported that these companies include oil and gas companies Murphy Oil Corporation and Apache Corporation.\n\n\"The Columbia Chronicle\" is the college's award-winning weekly newspaper. Frequency TV is the college's television station. WCRX (88.1 FM) is the college's radio station. These outlets are run by students for class credit in their respective departments. However, students working at \"The Chronicle\" and Frequency TV can get paid for their work. The newspaper has won numerous awards, the most recent in 2009–10 as Best Weekly College Newspaper in the state, midwest and nation.\n\nBroadcast journalism students produce two television news shows that are broadcast each week on Frequency TV: \"Newsbeat\" and \"Metro Minutes\". The student-produced \"Out on a Limb\" comedy television show has been nominated for a local Emmy Award. Radio students work on WCRX producing live mixes by local DJs, their own imaging, PSAs, and carrying select sport games. In 1998–1999, WCRX produced and broadcast \"Entertainment Primetime Weekly\", a show that is produced in newsradio style. It has also broadcast the Emmy Awards.\n\nJournalism students, and others, report and write articles that are published on Chicagotalks.org, a community and citizen journalism website sponsored by the Journalism Department. Journalism Department students in the Magazine Workshop class produce a magazine each semester called \"Echo\".\n\nAEMMP Records is the student-run record label. The staff develops an artist, produces an album, and markets the product throughout the course of an academic year.\n\nOther Columbia College Chicago publications include: \"Hair Trigger\", \"Columbia Poetry Review\", \"South Loop Review\", \"Center for Black Music Research Journal\", \"DEMO\", and\"@LAS\"\n\nIn addition to the academic programs offered at the college, students engage in many extracurricular activities. There are several major organizations on campus run by students. They include XC3ND: Columbia College Show Choir, Producer's Guild of Columbia (PGC), the Student Government Association, the Student Organization Council, the Student Alumni Association, the Student Athletics Association (Renegades), Columbia Urban Music Association, ReachOut, Senior Class, the Student Programming Board, the Asian Student Organization, Students Supporting Israel, Hillel, the International Student Organization, the Columbia College Association of Black Journalists (CCABJ), Hispanic Journalists of Columbia (HJC) and Columbia Pride, the on-campus LGBT student group. Other notable organizations are the Latino Alliance and Black Student Union, two of the oldest student groups on campus. These student organizations work together to provide leadership training and experience to Columbia students so they will be ready to take on leadership roles in their future places of employment.\n\nThe Student Government Association (SGA) consists of an Executive Board, the Senate, and committees. The Executive Board, or E-Board, consists of the President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Communications, Vice President of Finance, and the student representative to the College Board of Trustees.\n\nThe Senate consists of student representatives from each of the colleges academic departments, eight senators \"at-large\" who represent the college community as a whole, two senators who represent the college's vast commuter population, one senators from the Student Organization Council, one senator from the Student Athletics Association, and two senators from the Residence Hall Association.\n\nFrom those Senators there are six committees, each with a different focus.\n\nSGA Senate meetings are open to the public and are held on Tuesdays at 5 p.m. during the academic year.\n\nIn 2013, Animation Career Review ranked Columbia College Chicago as the Midwest's Top Animation and Game Design School. Nationally, Columbia College Chicago is ranked #8.\n\nIn 2010, Gamepro listed Columbia College Chicago in their list of \"6 Game Design Schools to Watch\".\n\nIn 2010, Columbia Journalism students won an Emmy Award in the Student News Feature category for the piece \"Youth Programs Aim to Combat Chicago Violence\"\n\nIn 2011, YouTube chose Columbia College Chicago and the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts to launch the first YouTube Creator Institute programs.\n"}

It is a murder mystery and political thriller set in a near-future federal Europe where no-one can be \"prejudiced from employment for reason of age, race, creed or incompitence \". Consequently, much of the population demonstrates an extreme lack of competence in their occupations.\n\nThe novel tells the story of a detective working for an unnamed secret agency, with a variety of identities within various law enforcement agencies (two examples being Europol and the Police Corruption Investigation Department). His real name remains a mystery but he commonly uses the pseudonym Harry Salt. The story starts with the apparent death of his former mentor (Klingferm) in an apparent elevator accident. He suspects foul play, and his investigations lead him around various states of Europe. In the course of these investigations, he seems to be tracked by an unknown stalker. On the way, he is hindered by the fact that practically everyone he meets has a serious character flaw and/or mental deficiency. Another ongoing problem is his inability to acquire or hang onto a decent pair of shoes, primarily as all shoes in the \"United States of Europe\" are made of vegetable matter. A number of new mental disorders have apparently been classified in the book's universe, such as Sexually Inappropriate Response and Non-Specific Stupidity.\n\nExamples of incompetence in the world around the agent are:\n\nThe plot appears to be based on the film \"The Third Man\".

They clearly avoid areas without vegetation cover and rocks.\n\nThe otters' diets consist mainly of fish (hence, the aquatic environment). However, during the winter and in colder environments, fish consumption is significantly lower and the otters use other resources for their food supply. Their diets can consist of amphibians (mainly frogs and pond turtles), bird predation (mainly anserine species), small rodents, and invertebrates such as water beetles, snails, and crayfish.

{"id": "1914242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914242", "title": "History of cancer chemotherapy", "text": "History of cancer chemotherapy\n\nThe era of cancer chemotherapy began in the 1940s with the first use of nitrogen mustards and folic acid antagonist drugs. The targeted therapy revolution has arrived, but many of the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.\n\nThe beginnings of the modern era of cancer chemotherapy can be traced directly to the German introduction of chemical warfare during World War I. Among the chemical agents used, mustard gas was particularly devastating. Although banned by the Geneva Protocol in 1925, the advent of World War II caused concerns over the possible re-introduction of chemical warfare. Such concerns led to the discovery of nitrogen mustard, a chemical warfare agent, as an effective treatment for cancer. Two pharmacologists from the Yale School of Medicine, Louis S. Goodman and Alfred Gilman, were recruited by the US Department of Defense to investigate potential therapeutic applications of chemical warfare agents. Goodman and Gilman observed that mustard gas was too volatile an agent to be suitable for laboratory experiments. They exchanged a nitrogen molecule for sulfur and had a more stable compound in nitrogen mustard. A year into the start of their research, a German air raid in Bari, Italy led to the exposure of more than 1000 people to the SS \"John Harvey\"'s secret cargo composed of mustard gas bombs. Dr. Stewart Francis Alexander, a lieutenant colonel who was an expert in chemical warfare, was subsequently deployed to investigate the aftermath. Autopsies of the victims suggested that profound lymphoid and myeloid suppression had occurred after exposure. In his report, Dr. Alexander theorized that since mustard gas all but ceased the division of certain types of somatic cells whose nature was to divide fast, it could also potentially be put to use in helping to suppress the division of certain types of cancerous cells.\n\nUsing that information, Goodman and Gilman reasoned that this agent could be used to treat lymphoma, a tumor of lymphoid cells. They first set up an animal model by establishing lymphomas in mice and demonstrated they could treat them with mustard agents. Next, in collaboration with a thoracic surgeon, Gustaf Lindskog, they injected a related agent, mustine (the prototype nitrogen mustard anticancer chemotherapeutic), into a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They observed a dramatic reduction in the patient's tumor masses. Although the effect lasted only a few weeks, and the patient had to return for another set of treatment, that was the first step to the realization that cancer could be treated by pharmacological agents. Publication of the first clinical trials was reported in 1946 in the \"New York Times\".\n\nShortly after World War II, a second approach to drug therapy of cancer began. Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School, studied the effects of folic acid on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a vitamin crucial for DNA metabolism (he did not know the significance of DNA at that time), had been discovered by Lucy Wills, when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by Harriett Kiltie and Yellapragada Subbarow of Lederle Laboratories. These analogues — first aminopterin and then amethopterin (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear — antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies at a time when the commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace. Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the New England Journal of Medicine was met with incredulity and ridicule.\n\nIn 1947, Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Babe Ruth, who was battling nasopharyngeal cancer, became one of the first human subjects of pteroyl triglutamate (also known by its brand name Teropterin, and similar to aminopterin) treatment. Dr. Richard Lewisohn of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York administered the drug, and over the course of several months, Ruth's condition began to improve. However, Ruth died the following year.\n\nIn 1951, Jane C. Wright demonstrated the use of methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer. Wright's group were the first to demonstrate use of the drug in solid tumors, as opposed to leukemias, which are a cancer of the marrow. Several years later at the National Cancer Institute, Roy Hertz and Min Chiu Li then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, discovering that methotrexate alone could cure choriocarcinoma (1958), a germ-cell malignancy that originates in trophoblastic cells of the placenta. In 1960 Wright et al. produced remissions in mycosis fungoides.\n\nJoseph Burchenal, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, with Farber's help, started his own methotrexate study and found the same effects. He then decided to try to develop anti-metabolites in the same way as Farber, by making small changes in a metabolite needed by a cell to divide. With the help of George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion, two pharmaceutical chemists who were working at the Burroughs Wellcome Co. in Tuckahoe, many purine analogues were tested, culminating in the discovery of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which was subsequently shown to be a highly active antileukemic drug.\n\nThe Eli Lilly natural products group found that alkaloids of the Madagascar periwinkle (\"Vinca rosea\"), originally discovered in a screen for anti-diabetic drugs, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The antitumour effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine) was later shown to be due to their ability to inhibit microtubule polymerization alkaloys, and therefore cell division.\n\nThe NCI, headed by Dr. John R. Heller Jr., lobbied the United States Congress for financial support for second-generation chemotherapy research. In response, Congress created a National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center (NCCSC) at the NCI in 1955. This was the first federal programme to promote drug discovery for cancer – unlike now, most pharmaceutical companies were not yet interested in developing anticancer drugs. The NCCSC developed the methodologies and crucial tools (like cell lines and animal models) for chemotherapeutic development.\n\nIn 1965, a major breakthrough in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs \"concurrently\" it would be more difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), vincristine (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.\n\nThis approach was extended to the lymphomas in 1963 by Vincent T. DeVita and George Canellos at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone — known as the MOPP regimen — could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nCurrently, nearly all successful cancer chemotherapy regimens use this paradigm of multiple drugs given simultaneously, called combination chemotherapy or polychemotherapy.\n\nAs predicted by studies in animal models, drugs were most effective when used in patients with tumours of smaller volume. Another important strategy developed from this — if the tumour burden could be reduced first by surgery, then chemotherapy may be able to clear away any remaining malignant cells, even if it would not have been potent enough to destroy the tumor in its entirety. This approach was termed \"adjuvant therapy\".\n\nEmil Frei first demonstrated this effect — high doses of methotrexate prevented recurrence of osteosarcoma following surgical removal of the primary tumour. 5-fluorouracil, which inhibits thymidylate synthase, was later shown to improve survival when used as an adjuvant to surgery in treating patients with colon cancer. Similarly, the landmark trials of Bernard Fisher, chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of Gianni Bonadonna, working in the Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano, Italy, proved that adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival — particularly in more advanced cancer.\n\nIn 1956, C. Gordon Zubrod, who had formerly led the development of antimalarial agents for the United States Army, took over the Division of Cancer Treatment of the NCI and guided development of new drugs. In the two decades that followed the establishment of the NCCSC, a large network of cooperative clinical trial groups evolved under the auspices of the NCI to test anticancer agents. Zubrod had a particular interest in natural products, and established a broad programme for collecting and testing plant and marine sources, a controversial programme that led to the discovery of taxanes (in 1964) and camptothecins (in 1966). Both classes of drug were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of Monroe Wall at the Research Triangle Institute.\n\nPaclitaxel (Taxol) was a novel antimitotic agent that promoted microtubule assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and could only be obtained from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree, which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in ovarian cancer therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol.\n\nAnother drug class originating from the NCI was the camptothecins. Camptothecin, derived from a Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by kidney toxicity: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, irinotecan, won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.\n\nCisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was discovered by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing to try to explain this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.\n\nA second group with an NCI contract, led by John Montgomery at the Southern Research Institute, synthesized nitrosoureas, an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA. Fludarabine phosphate, a purine analogue which has become a mainstay in treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was another similar development by Montgomery.\n\nOther effective molecules also came from industry during the period of 1970 to 1990, including anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins — both of which inhibited the action of topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis.\n\nAs is obvious from their origins, the above cancer chemotherapies are essentially poisons. Patients receiving these agents experienced severe side-effects that limited the doses which could be administered, and hence limited the beneficial effects. Clinical investigators realized that the ability to manage these toxicities was crucial to the success of cancer chemotherapy.\n\nSeveral examples are noteworthy. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause profound suppression of the bone marrow. This is reversible, but takes time to recover. Support with platelet and red-cell transfusions as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics in case of infection during this period is crucial to allow the patient to recover.\n\nSeveral practical factors are also worth mentioning. Most of these agents caused very severe nausea (termed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the literature) which, while not directly causing patient deaths, was unbearable at higher doses. The development of new drugs to prevent nausea (the prototype of which was ondansetron) was of great practical use, as was the design of indwelling intravenous catheters (e.g. Hickman lines and PICC lines) which allowed safe administration of chemotherapy as well as supportive therapy.\n\nOne important contribution during this period was the discovery of a means that allowed the administration of previously lethal doses of chemotherapy. The patient's bone marrow was first harvested, the chemotherapy administered, and the harvested marrow then returned to patient a few days later. This approach, termed autologous bone marrow transplantation, was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, including those with advanced breast cancer. However, rigorous studies have failed to confirm this benefit, and autologous transplantation is no longer widely used for solid tumors. The proven curative benefits of high doses of chemotherapy afforded by autologous bone marrow rescue are limited to both Hodgkin's and selected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who have failed therapy with conventional combination chemotherapy. Autologous transplantation continues to be used as a component of therapy for a number of other hematologic malignancies.\n\nThe hormonal contribution to several categories of breast cancer subtypes was recognized during this time, leading to the development of pharmacological modulators (e.g. of oestrogen) such as tamoxifen.\n\nMolecular genetics has uncovered signalling networks that regulate cellular activities such as proliferation and survival. In a particular cancer, such a network may be radically altered, due to a chance somatic mutation. Targeted therapy inhibits the metabolic pathway that underlies that type of cancer's cell division.\n\nThe classic example of targeted development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has been known for a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.\n\nAnother branch in targeted therapy is the increasing use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. Although monoclonal antibodies (immune proteins which can be selected to precisely bind to almost any target) have been around for decades, they were derived from mice and did not function particularly well when administered to humans, causing allergic reactions and being rapidly removed from circulation. \"Humanization\" of these antibodies (genetically transforming them to be as similar to a human antibody as possible) has allowed the creation of a new family of highly effective humanized monoclonal antibodies. Trastuzumab, a drug used to treat breast cancer, is a prime example.\n\nThe discovery that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination can cure certain cancers ranks as one of the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood ALL, testicular cancer, and Hodgkins disease, previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including testicular cancer, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and some leukemias. It has also proved effective in the adjuvant setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, among others.\n\nThe overall impact of chemotherapy on cancer survival can be difficult to estimate, since improved cancer screening, prevention (e.g. anti-smoking campaigns), and detection all influence statistics on cancer incidence and mortality. In the United States, overall cancer incidence rates were stable from 1995 through 1999, while cancer death rates decreased steadily from 1993 through 1999. Again, this likely reflects the combined impact of improved screening, prevention, and treatment. Nonetheless, cancer remains a major cause of illness and death, and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has proved unable to cure most cancers after they have metastasized.\n\n\n\n"}

She is both the earliest recorded female artist and the first known pastelist working in the English colonies, and is the first portraitist known to have worked in what would become the southern United States.\n\nBoth the date and place of Johnston's birth are unknown; it has been suggested, and is generally accepted, that she was born in northwestern France, near the town of Rennes. Her parents, both French Huguenots, were Francis (possibly Cézar) and Suzanna de Beaulieu, and the family immigrated to London in either 1685 or 1687. In 1694 Henrietta married Robert (possibly William) Dering, fifth son of Sir Edward Dering, Baronet, and his wife Mary; she and her husband then moved to Ireland. It was during this time that Johnston began to draw pastels. Her earliest portraits depicted a number of powerful people to whom she was related by marriage; among these were John Perceval, later to become Earl of Egmont, and one of the Earls of Barrymore. Her earliest surviving pastel dates to 1704.\nDering's husband died in about 1704, leaving Henrietta a widow with two daughters. In 1705 she married again, this time to Anglican clergyman Gideon Johnston, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin then serving as the vicar at Castlemore. Two years later, he was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to serve as commissary of the Church of England in North and South Carolina and the Bahama Islands. He was also to serve as rector of St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Charleston. The couple's time in the colonies was hard; Johnston was frequently writing the Society to request payment of his salary, which was often delayed, and their lives were further hampered by illness, lack of supplies, and distance from family. In one of his letters to his patron Gilbert Burnet, written in 1709, Johnston mentions that \"were it not for the assistance my wife gives by drawing of Pictures (which can last but a little time in a place so ill peopled) I should not be able to live\", indicating that Henrietta had again taken up her drawing to augment the couple's income. Another letter, dated a year later, reveals that she had run out of drawing materials and suffered \"a long and tedious Sickness\". Johnston made one return trip to England, in 1711–1712; her husband, too, returned there once, from 1713 to 1715. He died in a boating accident in 1716, not long after returning to Charleston.\nLittle is known of Johnston's later life in the colonies. She is known to have traveled at some point to New York City, as four portraits dated 1725 exist depicting members of a family from that city. She returned to Charleston at some time before her death in 1729.\n\nJohnston and her second husband are buried together in the cemetery of St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Charleston. One of her daughters by her first marriage, Mary Dering, later became lady-in-waiting to the daughters of George II.\n\nA suggestion has been made that Johnston was related to the painter and dancing master William Dering, who migrated to Charleston from Williamsburg, Virginia in 1749, but this is not generally accepted.\n\nIt is unknown whether or not Johnston studied painting and drawing; however, given the sophistication of her work, it is likely that she did indeed receive some form of training. Similarities between her pastels and the works of Irish artist Edmund Ashfield and of Edward Luttrell indicate that she may have studied with them at some point.\n\nIn pose and coloring, many of Johnston's portraits strongly resemble those of Sir Godfrey Kneller, which at the time were greatly in fashion in the United Kingdom and the colonies. Her pastels from Ireland are drawn in deep earth tones, while those from her time in South Carolina are generally lighter and smaller, due likely to the precious nature of her materials, which had to be imported. The Irish works, which show the most attention to detail of all her works, depict sitters at three-quarter length, as do the earliest of her Carolina pastels. Johnston's American female subjects are usually shown wearing chemises, while the male subjects are drawn mostly in street clothes; some of the latter are depicted wearing armor. Each subject is shown sitting erect, with the head frequently turned at a slight angle from the body and towards the viewer. The faces are typically dominated by large oval eyes. Works dating to after her second husband's death are less finished; details of clothing are less well-defined and colors are less saturated, suggesting either that the artist was running out of materials or that she was working at greater speed to complete commissions.\n\nJohnston usually signed her portraits on their wooden backing, noting her name, the location of completion, and the date of completion in order. A typical signature is the inscription on the reverse of her portrait of Philip Perceval: \"Henrietta Dering Fecit / Dublin Anno 1704.\" Johnston was almost exclusively a portraitist; the only landscapes attributed to her hand are the backgrounds of a pair of children's portraits from New York, which are also her only known portraits of children.\n\nAbout forty portraits by Johnston are known to survive; many have preserved their original frames and backboards, on which her signature may be found. These mostly depict members of her social circle and, later, of her husband's Charleston congregation, such as Colonel William Rhett. Many of her South Carolina portraits depict members of Huguenot families that had settled in the New World, including the Prioleaus, Bacots (including Pierre Bacot and his first wife Marianne Fleur Du Gue) and duBoses. Today, a number of her works are held by the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, which has developed an interactive online exhibition dedicated to her work; other pieces may be seen in the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Greenville County Museum of Art. Johnston is not known to have worked in oils, but one of her portraits was copied at some point by Jeremiah Theus.\n\nNine portraits, each depicting members of the Southwell and Perceval families, were owned by American preservationist Jim Williams and displayed at his Mercer House in Savannah, Georgia. Seven are inscribed \"Dublin, Ireland\" and are dated from 1704 to 1705. They were put up for sale by Sotheby's in 2000, seven with their original frames. Williams protected them from the\nlight in an upstairs dressing room where the shutters were kept closed.\n"}

The area, which was once an important centre for the limestone industry, became the terminus of the Peak Forest Canal. Its pub, the Navigation Inn, was once owned by \"Coronation Street\" actress Pat Phoenix.\n\nThe village lies almost from Whaley Bridge and about southeast of Manchester.\n\nThe village was originally called Bugsworth, from the Old English \"Bucga's Worth\" (\"Bucga's Enclosure\"), but in the early 20th century some residents began to dislike the name of their village; their cause was championed by the local vicar, Dr J R Towers, and the village school headmaster, Mr W T Prescott. As a result of the efforts of these two residents, Bugsworth officially became Buxworth on 16 April 1930.\n\nIn 1999 the local High Peak Borough Council spent £350 to organise a ballot of the 600 members of the local population. The result was 233 to 139 to keep the name as Buxworth. However, the village is still generally referred to as 'Buggy' by locals.\n\nThe Peak Forest Canal terminates here at Bugsworth Basin (the renaming of the village had no effect on the name of the canal basin), which was re-opened on 26 March 2005 having been restored by the Inland Waterways Protection Society, and, once again, the canal now ends at its original terminus. It is used entirely for recreational purposes.\n\nThe canal never reached Peak Forest but limestone from quarries near Dove Holes was, between 1796 and 1922, transported to the basin by way of the Peak Forest Tramway – a distance of some six miles. Its trackbed can still be discerned in places (e.g. at Whitehough, close to Chinley, and just beyond the end of the bypass on the way south to Buxton).\n\nA main railway line (Sheffield to Manchester) passes north of the village. The railway was originally the Midland Railway's main line to London, built in 1867 as part of the extension of its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, and in 1894 the Midland built the line from Dore, which today is the Hope Valley line. Almost as soon as it was built a landslip destroyed the viaduct. Some four hundred men made drainage channels and built a new timber viaduct, which served until 1885 when the present one was built. A tunnel to the north of the station collapsed during building, trapping a gang of navvies, who were close to death by the time they were rescued. In 1903, when the line upgraded to four tracks, the tunnel was opened out into a cutting. \nThere was a station at Buxworth, also originally called Bugsworth, renamed on 4 June 1930, seven weeks after the village was renamed. This closed on 15 September 1958, but the building and parts of the platforms remain to this day. All through the station's existence it has experienced a peculiar anomaly in that reconstructing the collapsed viaduct also involved realigning the railway line a little way to the north. As a result, the tracks have always run past the \"wrong side\" of the station building, where the approach road was originally intended to be, with a new approach road hastily laid where the tracks were originally supposed to be. The old station house is owned by Burnage School For Boys in Manchester and is opened for visits frequently.\n\nThe village is split into two by the Whaley Bridge–Chapel-en-le-Frith bypass (A6), constructed in the 1980s.\n\nJohn Cotton, the last man to be hanged in Derby Gaol in 1898, murdered his wife in Bugsworth basin after drinking heavily in the Rose & Crown (now demolished) at Bugsworth.\n\nBuxworth Primary School, founded in 1884, is the only school remaining in Buxworth. The school is currently headed by Paul Bertram and was previously co-headed by Jennifer Rackstraw and Louise Moore. Their current Ofsted rating is 'Good'.\nBuxworth cricket team, which was founded around 1848, play in the Derbyshire & Cheshire League. Former Buxworth player Alan (Bud) Hill went on to play for Derbyshire for over fourteen seasons, scoring more than 12,000 first-class runs at an average of 30.89.\n\nBuxworth Football Club, nicknamed the Canal Men, play in the Premier division of the Hope Valley Amateur League with Buxworth Reserves competing in the Premier Division.\n\nBrierley Green adjoins Buxworth and in the early 19th century it was the home of the Clayton family. The eldest son, Joel Henry Clayton, emigrated to the US to live with an uncle at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Other members of the Clayton family followed him and eventually they settled in a valley at the foot of Mount Diablo, some 30 miles from San Francisco, California where they founded Clayton. Buxworth and Clayton are now twinned.\n\n"}

He attended high school and enrolled in the University of Lisbon School of Law, but did not finish his degree. Brum do Canto wrote about film; in 1925 he took his first acting role, a part in Rino Lupo's film \"O Desconhecido\". From 1927 to 1929, Brum do Canto wrote for the newspaper \"O Século\". Meanwhile, he edited and/or collaborated on several cinema magazines flourishing at the time (\"Cinéfilo\", \"Kino\" and \"Imagem\").\n\nInterested in the French vanguard, he followed their lead as a director in his first film (\"A Dança dos Paroxismos\"), shot at the end of 1929. The film (produced by Mello, Castello Branco, Lda.) was first shown in November 1930; it was presented again on October 27, 1984 in the \"Cinemateca Portuguesa\", which has its negatives and the only existing copies. Two years later he produced another film, \"Paisagem\", but it was never completed for financial reasons. Until 1935 he shot more minor documentaries as an amateur, turning professional later that year when he assisted director Leitão de Barros on \"As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor\". The following year, Brun do Canto was again assistant director on Chianca de Garcia's \"O Trevo de Quatro Folhas\".\n\nIn 1936–37, after several unsuccessful productions Brum do Canto directed his first feature film, \"A Canção da Terra\"; it was well received at its premiere.

From 1953 to 1959 he interrupted his cinematic career and left his home in Lisbon, establishing himself on Porto Santo Island in Madeira (where he owned large properties) and dedicating himself to agriculture and sport fishing.\n\nBrum do Canto returned to cinema during the next decade with three films. In 1973, the Portuguese audience discovered him as an actor in theatrical plays broadcast by RTP. He acted successfully in Paddy Chayefsky's \"O Grande Negócio\" and Reginald Rose's \"Twelve Angry Men\", both directed by Artur Ramos.

The first appear in the fossil record in the Mississippian period and continue through to the Early Permian.\n\nThe skull is small but very specialised, with large orbits, and large fenestrae. The primitive form \"Ophiderpeton\" has a pattern of dermal bones in the skull similar in respects to the temnospondyls. But in the advanced genus \"Phlegethontia\" the skull is very light and open, reduced to a series of struts supporting the braincase against the lower jaw, just as in snakes, and it is possible that the Aïstopods filled the same ecological niches in the Paleozoic that snakes do today.\nThey had an extremely elongated body, with up to 230 vertebrae. The vertebrae were holospondylous, having only a single ossification per segment. They lacked intercentra, even in the tail, and had are no free haemal arches. The neural arch was low and fused to the centrum. All of these features are very similar to those of the Nectridea, both representing the typical lepospondylous condition.\n\nA recent paper described the internal organization of the aïstopod head, finding that aïstopods retained many fish-like features of the skull and brain, including a persistent extension of the notochord into the head and an open canal between the pituitary gland and the mouth. Because these features are lost early in tetrapod evolution, this may be evidence that aïstopods diverged from other tetrapods soon after the origin of digits.\n\nThe ribs were slender, either single or double-headed, with the head shaped like a letter \"K\". There is no trace of limbs or even limb girdles in any known fossil, and the tail was short and primitive.\n\nEvolutionary relationships with other early tetrapods remain controversial, as even the earliest aistopod, the Viséan species \"Lethiscus stocki\", was already highly specialised. Aïstopods have been variously grouped with other lepospondyls, or placed at or prior to the batrachomorph-reptiliomorph divide. However, a cladistic analysis by Pardo et al. (2017) recovered Aistopoda at the base of Tetrapoda. The group was quite diverse during the Late Carboniferous, with a few forms continuing through to the Permian.\n\nBelow is a cladogram from Anderson \"et al.\" (2003) showing the phylogenetic relationships of aistopods:\n\n\n"}

Meanwhile, Guimarães worked in advertising in Metro Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIn 1952, Manuel Guimarães directed \"Nazaré\", which had the script wrote by the neo-realist writer Alves Redol, portraiting the life of the fishermen from Nazaré. The film had several cuts caused by censorship. \"Vidas Sem Rumo (1956), script by Manuel Guimarães and dialogues by Alves Redol, suffered even worse cuts: about half of the film was cut and entire scenes were removed, becoming an almost unintelligible film.\n\nBeing constantly attacked by the regime, Guimarães opted to direct more commercial movies about sport events, since 1956. In his attempt to return to fiction, (\"A Costureirinha da Sé\" – 1958) Manuel had to accept product placement in the film. His next works were essentially documentaries promoting Portuguese towns and products.\n\nAntónio da Cunha Telles, who meanwhile began to produce the first films of the Portuguese Cinema Novo (New Cinema), became interested in him and accepted to do an executive production and co-production of two of his next films: \"O Crime da Aldeia Velha\" (1964), an adaptation of a Bernardo Santareno play and \"O trigo e o Joio\" (1965) based in the book with the same name, by Fernando Namora, who wrote the script as well.

He was born in Figueira da Foz on February 2, 1939 and died of cancer in Lisbon on February 3, 2003.\n\nJoão César Monteiro was born into a family with anti-clerical and anti-fascist ideals. His family moved to Lisbon when Monteiro was 15 years old to enable him to continue his studies. In 1963, with a grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Monteiro traveled to Great Britain to study at the London Film School (known then as the London School of Film Technique). In 1965 in Portugal, he began work on his first film, \"Quem Espera por Sapatos de Defunto Morre Descalço\" (Who Waits for the Deceased's Shoes Dies Barefoot), which would not be finished for five years due to financial problems. At the same time, he made the short documentary \"Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen\", about the Portuguese poet. Monteiro also wrote film criticism for periodicals like \"Imagem\", \"Diário de Lisboa\" and \"O Século\".\n\nHis first feature film was \"\" (1972). In 1982 he made \"Silvestre\" an adaptation of traditional Portuguese folk stories. \"Silvestre\" was shown at the Venice Film Festival and was an important step in his international recognition. \"À Flor do Mar\" (1986), featuring Laura Morante, was shown at the Salsomaggiore Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Prize. Monteiro returned to the Venice Film Festival in 1989 with \"Recordações da Casa Amarela\" (Silver Lion), a film that marked the introduction of the character João de Deus.

In some of his last films, he played a recurrent protagonist, João de Deus, a remarkably articulated and over-sexualized character whose customary attitudes involved spontaneous streaks of hedonism, scandal and satire. \n\nAlthough a substantial portion of his work was received with perplexity and outrage by the average movie-going audience, he has been recognized by Portuguese and international critics and academicians as one of the most important Portuguese directors, along with Manoel de Oliveira.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He pioneered the study of physiological optics at Dartmouth College, serving as a research professor, then as director of research at the Dartmouth Eye Institute. He conducted important research into aspects of binocular vision, including cyclophoria and aniseikonia. Ames is perhaps best known for constructing illusions of visual perception, most notably the Ames room and the Ames window. He was a leading light in the Transactionalist School of psychology and also made contributions to social psychology.\n\nAdelbert Ames Jr. was born in 1880 in Lowell, Massachusetts. His father, Adelbert Ames, was a general in the Union Army during the Civil War and Reconstruction Governor and Senator from Mississippi; his mother, Blanche Butler Ames, was the daughter of U.S. General Benjamin F. Butler, a controversial military leader, politician, and unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. presidency. Apart from his military and administrative service, General Ames obtained several U.S. patents for pencil sharpeners and other mechanical devices. Ames' sister Blanche Ames Ames was a woman's rights suffragist, and his brother Butler Ames was a politician and Army officer during the Spanish–American War. His son, Adelbert Ames III (1921-2018), was the Charles Anthony Pappas Professor of Neuroscience, Emeritus, at Harvard University. In research papers, Adelbert Ames Jr. is commonly cited as Adelbert Ames II, to prevent his being confused with his father or his son.\n\nAmes attended Philips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, then went to Harvard College, where he earned a law degree, and where his most influential teachers were George Santayana and William James (whose daughter he was also engaged to, but did not marry). After practicing law for a few years, Ames abandoned it to become a painter. For several years, while collaborating with his sister, Blanche Ames (who was also a painter), the two of them tried to determine if the quality of visual art could be improved by the scientific study of vision. Ames set about improving his knowledge of the optical components of the eye, assuming that once he had mastered them, he would return to painting. As it was, his studies mastered him and Ames made vision his life's work.\n\nAmes went to Clark University in 1914 to study physiological optics, making enough of an impression to be made one of the eighteen founding members of the Optical Society of America in 1916. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, he served briefly as a captain in the aviation service, then as the overseer of a machine shop in which prototypes for instruments were developed. While in the army he continued his studies of optics, in part because one of the soldiers in that shop (with whom he became a friend and collaborator) was Charles Proctor, professor of physics at Dartmouth College.\n\nAfter the war, Ames went to Dartmouth College in 1919 to work with Proctor. They decided to construct a large-scale model of the human eye using glass for its various layers, humors, and lens. In 1921, this work led to Ames' first published scientific paper, the award of an honorary Master of Arts degree, and his election as professor of research in a new department of Physiological Optics.\n\nIn 1923, Ames began recruiting staff of what was to become the Dartmouth Eye Institute. From Eastman Kodak Company he recruited lens designer Gordon H. Gliddon. More staff joined the department over the years, including Kenneth N. Ogle, with whom Ames worked on stereopsis and binocular vision. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928.\n\nIn 1935 the Department of Physiological Optics became the Dartmouth Eye Institute under the overall directorship of Alfred Bielschowsky, with Ames serving as its director of research. Ames garnered support for it from various sources including John D. Rockefeller Jr., the Rockefeller Foundation, and the American Optical Company. The institute at various times employed between thirty and forty staff, including researchers, and clinicians who examined patients' eyes and made eyeglasses.\n\nResearch at the institute concentrated on binocular vision, including cyclophoria (the tendency of the eyes to rotate in opposite directions in their sockets) and aniseikonia (in which each eye has a differently sized retinal image of the same object). This latter defect could be corrected by lenses that restored the usual equality of image sizes.\n\nIn 1940, Bielschowsky died unexpectedly. Hermann Burian, an ophthalmologist, worked briefly as acting director, and then was relieved by Walter Lancaster. He was not able to exert the influence he wanted, resigning in 1942. On 10 May 1947 the institute was closed.\n\nAmes is perhaps best known for his eponymous room, window, and chair. These were called \"equivalent configurations\" by Ittelson (1952), defined as \"configurations [in which] identical 'incoming messages' can come from different external physical arrangements. In the absence of other information... equivalent configurations will be perceived as identical, no matter how different they be physically\" (p. 55).\n\nAmes also developed the concept of \"transactional ambiguity\" holding that \"mental set\" or expectation could materially affect one's perception of visual and other stimuli, as with the Ames trapezoid. This hypothesis extended the impact of mental set from the widely believed impact on one's conclusions about stimuli (the eye witness phenomenon) to actual perception of the stimuli itself. If true, it calls seriously into question the value of eye witness reports even by individuals with no prejudices about their observations. In 1941 Ames began to make notes in the morning on his transactional analysis of perception. In 1960 his collaborator Hadley Cantril published an edited selection from these notes, with a Preface, and included Ames' correspondence with John Dewey.\n\nIn 1954, Ames was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Dartmouth. In 1955 he won the Tillyer Medal, awarded by the Optical Society of America. Ames died on July 3, 1955, and was buried at the Dartmouth Cemetery. His name, and that of his siblings, is also inscribed on the gravestone of his parents at the Hildreth family cemetery in Lowell.\n\nIn the address given on the presentation of the Tillyer Medal, the president of the society listed 38 books and scientific papers Ames wrote, and 21 patents awarded to Ames.\n\n\n\n\n"}

St Hilda's is the only girls' school in the Gold Coast region. Its brother school is The Southport School (TSS), also located in Southport, and the only boys' boarding school in the region.\n\nThe school is a member of the Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australia (AGSA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), and the Australian Boarding Schools' Association.\n\nSt Hilda's School was founded in 1912, when the Diocese of Brisbane of the Anglican Church of Australia purchased an older school, Goyte-Lea, from Miss Davenport. Goyte-Lea was established prior to Australian federation in the late 19th century. The School was named after the seventh century Abbess of Whitby Saint Hilda. Saint Hilda was said to have turned serpents into stone, and three stone serpents are the emblem of the school's crest.\n\nThe School's first Headmistress was Catherine Bourne, for whom a series of classrooms are named. The School's motto since establishment is \"Non nobis solum\", Latin for \"Not for Ourselves Alone\".\n\nAlthough always a girls' school, St Hilda's does have 'old boys'. During the Second World War, secondary schools were used as army barracks. In March 1942, St Hilda's evacuated 90 boards to Pikedale homestead near Stanthorpe. The Anglican Church relocated boys from the Church of England Boys' School in Toowoomba, to St Hilda's in April 1942, while St Hildas was also used for a short time by the 135th Medical Regiment. The school returned from Pikedale to Southport in December 1943.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2016 Peter Crawley served as the first male principal of the school.\n\nSt Hilda's is situated on a single, campus, featuring gardens and bushland, at Southport, located one hour's drive south of Brisbane on Australia's Gold Coast. The school comprises a primary school (Pre-Preparatory to Year 6), middle school (Years 7 to 9) and senior school (Years 10 to 12). The whole school is on the one grounds, although the primary school is separate from the middle and senior schools. The middle and senior schools share facilities and teaching staff. The school has two libraries, the Junior School Library and Senior School Library, as well as IT facilities.\n\nBuilt in 1995, the St Hilda's School Sports complex features indoor courts suitable for basketball, netball, badminton, and volleyball; a fitness gym; an artistic and rhythmic gymnastics area including a foam pit, balance beams and vaulting horse; and a 50m heated outdoor swimming pool. The School also has one oval and outdoor tennis and netball courts. The School previously owned hockey fields opposite the Gold Coast Hospital but this land was sold and is now developed as part of the redevelopment of the Gold Coast Hospital precinct.\n\nAs with most Australian schools, St Hilda's uses a [house system] to facilitate in-school competition in sporting and cultural events. A highlight of this competition is the Inter-House Musicals which are held at the Gold Coast Arts Centre. Other competitions include the Inter-House Athletics carnival, Inter-House Cross-Country, Inter-House Swimming carnival, Inter-House Drama Festival and Inter-House Debating.\n\nThe School's Houses are named after Australian plants. In the Middle and Senior schools, the houses are Banksia, Melaleuca and Karragaroo. The corresponding Junior School Houses are Acacia, Tristania and Grevillea.\n\nThe school has one of the largest iPad programs in the world. The school also uses the learning management system 'Blackboard' and is an advanced user of eBooks. It is presently exploring the use of iTunes University.\n\nSt Hilda's is a member of the Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA) and the Andrews Cup, the only such school on the Gold Coast. Members of sporting teams travel to areas throughout South East Queensland to participate in sporting events.\n\nSt Hilda's participates in a Student Exchange Program with a number of schools in the United States of America, England, New Zealand, Scotland, Canada, and South Africa.\nAbout 40 students, in Year 10, participate in the program each year. They travel to the exchange schools for a six-week period.\n\n"}

The most well-known and well-studied species in the genus is \"Cryphonectria parasitica\", the species which causes chestnut blight. The genus was, for a time, considered synonymous with \"Endothia\", but the two are now recognised as distinct. Taxonomic studies in 2006 limited the genus to four species, but a fifth, \"Cryphonectria naterciae\", was described in 2011 from Portugal.\n\nAccording to [(Murr) (And.et And.)] Chestnut blight was first discovered in North America in 1904 on \"Castanea dentata\". By the 1940s it had killed most wild American chestnut trees, which were formerly one of the most abundant species in the eastern U.S.\n\nThe infection takes place through bark wounds. In the early stage, clear yellow-brown spots appear\non the young twigs; the bark then splits open, sinks in and dies out. In the next stage the cambium layer is infected, the tree trunk becomes disformed, the split bark parts start to swell as parasitic fungus produces more peridermia and yellow colored pycnidia start to appear on the bark. Then the tree's leaves wilt and branches start dying off. The release of fungal spores lasts through the whole vegetative season.\n"}

After occasional appearances for the senior side, he spent the 1988–89 season on loan with Serie B club Ancona. He returned to a Torino team that had been relegated, but scored 6 goals as they won the Serie B title and were promoted straight back to Serie A for the 1990–91 season. Under the coach Emiliano Mondonico, he immediately won the Mitropa Cup in 1991, and he reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 1992, also achieving a third-place finish in Serie A during 1991–92 season.\n\nHis skill, talent, and notable performances with Torino attracted attention from larger clubs, as well as his first international call-up for Italy. He was eventually signed by A.C. Milan for a world record of £13 million in 1992, and was a key part of their side during the 1992–93 season under manager Fabio Capello, scoring 7 goals in Serie A as they won the league title, two Italian Supercups in 1992 and 1993, and as they also reached the Champions League Final, only to be defeated by Marseille.\n\nA year after signing for Milan, at the age of 24, Lentini was involved in a serious car crash whilst driving home from a pre-season tournament in Genoa, in August 1993. He fractured his skull and damaged his eye socket and he spent about two days in a light coma. After the crash he never fully recovered his mercurial dribbling skills. Plagued by 'memory loss', periods of blurred vision, and 'dizzy spells' he was tormented by the spectre of what his career once was, when he returned to the pitch at the end of the 1993–94 season. His teammate at the time, Marcel Desailly, was compelled to confess that “You could see the skills, how he was before the accident and after the accident, the balance was completely different”. His career in Milan fizzled out and culminated in a European Cup medal and another Serie A title that season, but this was merely for filling the bench; a paltry return for the world's most expensive signing at the time. The next two seasons would see him make few appearances, although he collected another Italian Supercup with the club, as well as a UEFA Super Cup, in 1994, also receiving runners-up medals in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup and the 1995 UEFA Champions League Final. During his final season with the club, he won a third Serie A medal.\n\nIn 1996, he moved from Milan to Atalanta for a season, helping the club to a mid-table finish alongside Filippo Inzaghi, and he went on to play for six further clubs. He returned to Torino in 1997, spending three seasons with the club, and during the 1998–99 Serie B season, he helped his side to earn to promotion to Serie A the following season, where they once again would face relegation, before playing several seasons in the lower divisions with various other clubs. He subsequently played with Cosenza (2001–03), Cosenza F.C. (2003–04), Canelli (2004–08), Saviglianese (2008–09), and Nicese (2009–11), before ending his career with Carmagnola during the 2011–12 season, at the age of 43.\n\nLentini initially made 2 appearances with the Italy national under-21 football team between 1987 and 1990, making his debut on 29 November 1989; he was a member of the squad that reached the semi-finals of the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, under manager Cesare Maldini, eventually finishing the tournament in third place. Whilst at Torino, he gained his first senior cap for the Italy national football team, in an international friendly in Terni against Belgium on 13 February 1991, which ended in a 0–0 draw. He later become a regular member of Arrigo Sacchi's Italy side during the 1994 FIFA World Cup Qualifying campaign, although he would miss out on the final tournament due to his inconsistent performances following his serious car accident in August 1993. He was capped on 13 occasions in total, making his last appearance on 6 November 1996.\n\nDuring his prime, prior to his road accident in 1993, which later affected his career, Lentini was considered a highly talented prospect, and was known for his pace, mobility, work-rate, physical strength, intelligence, and leadership. Although he was usually deployed as a left winger, he was capable of playing on either flank. In particular, he was highly regarded for his creativity, his excellent technical ability, agility, speed, balance, and his dribbling skills, as well as his crossing ability, which made him an extremely effective attacking threat on the wing, and allowed him to beat opponents in one on one situations and subsequently provide assists for his teammates.\n\nLentini was married to Alexandra Carlsson from Sweden and their son Nicholas was born in 1996.\n\nNicholas is currently a goalkeeper.\n\nMilan\n\nTorino\n"}

The species in this genus are the most well-known of the parasitic catfishes also known as candiru, known for their alleged habit of entering the human urethra.\n\nThere are currently three recognized species in this genus:\n\n\"V. beccarii\" originates from the Orinoco River basin and rivers of The Guianas. \"V. cirrhosa\" is distributed in the Amazon Basin. \"V. sanguinea\" inhabits the Amazon, Orinoco, and Essequibo River basins.\n\n\"V. beccarii\" can be distinguished from other vandelliines by its square or slightly emarginate caudal fin and the colour pattern of two dark bands extending from the dorsal fin and the anal fin and converging onto the caudal fin. \"V. sanguinea\" may grow to 5.3 centimetres (2.1 in) SL. \"V. cirrhosa\" grows up to SL.\n\nThese species are hematophagous (blood-consuming) parasites, like all other members of the subfamily Vandelliinae. \"V. cirrhosa\" uses visual and chemo-sensory orientation to find potential hosts. It is active both during the daytime and nighttime while foraging. \"V. cirrhosa\" enters the gill chambers of larger fish to suck blood. It bites mostly at the ventral or dorsal aorta arteries, and the blood is pumped into its gut by the host's blood pressure; it does not need any special sucking or pumping mechanism to quickly engorge itself with blood, but simply uses its needle-like teeth to make an incision in an artery. \"V. cirrhosa\" is able to engorge itself enormously; the ingested blood is visible through the swollen belly. Some kind of valve or sphincter is likely present to prevent reflux of ingested blood. The time required to engorge itself with blood and leave the host's gill chamber ranges from 30–145 seconds. Some host fish species (\"Colossoma macropomum\") are able to hamper the attacks of \"V. cirrhosa\" by pressing the fish under the bony gill-cover flap, or by using its pectoral fin to press it against the flank or to sweep it from the gill-cover edge. \"V. cirrhosa\" is reputed to be able to enter the urethra of humans urinating under water; presumably it mistakes the urea for water exhausted from gills, however this has never been clinically proven.\n\nWhen inactive, \"V. cirrhosa\" burrows in sandy or soft, muddy bottoms. \"V. beccarii\" has been captured free-swimming.\n"}

The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The character Colonel Race is introduced in this novel.\n\nAnne Beddingfeld is on her own and ready for adventures when one comes her way. She sees a man die in a tube station and picks up a piece of paper dropped nearby. The message on the paper leads her to South Africa as she fits more pieces of the puzzle together about the death she witnessed. There is a murder in England the next day, and the murderer attempts to kill her on the ship en route to Cape Town.\n− \n\nReviews were mixed at publication, as some hoped for another book featuring Poirot, while others liked the writing style and were sure that readers would want to read to the end to learn who is the murderer. A later review liked the start of the novel, and felt that the end did not keep pace with the quality of the start, and the reviewer did not like when the story became like a thriller novel.\n\nNadina, a dancer in Paris, receives a visit from Count Sergius Paulovitch. Both are in the service of \"the Colonel\", an international agent provocateur and criminal. \"The Colonel\" is retiring, leaving his agents high and dry. Nadina has a plan to blackmail the Colonel.\n\nAnne Beddingfeld is an orphan after the sudden death of her archaeologist father. Longing for adventure, she jumps at the chance live in London. Returning from an unsuccessful job interview, Anne is at Hyde Park Corner tube station when a man falls onto the live track, dying instantly. A doctor examines the man, pronounces him dead, and leaves. Anne picks up the note he dropped, which reads \"17.1 22 Kilmorden Castle\". The inquest of L B Carton brings a verdict of accidental death. Carton carried a house agent's order to view Mill House in Marlow, and the next day the newspapers report that a dead woman has been found there, strangled. The house belongs to Sir Eustace Pedler MP. A young man in a brown suit is identified as a suspect, having entered the house soon after the dead woman.\n\nAnne realises the examination of the dead man was oddly done, and becomes suspicious. At Mill House, she finds a canister of undeveloped film and she learns that \"Kilmorden Castle\" is the name of a sailing ship. She books passage on it. On board the ship, Anne meets Suzanne Blair, Colonel Race, and Sir Eustace Pedler. In addition to his secretary, Guy Pagett, Pedler employs Harry Rayburn.\n\nColonel Race recounts the story of the theft of a hundred thousand pounds' worth of diamonds some years before, attributed to the son of a South African gold magnate, John Eardsley, and his friend Harry Lucas. John and his friend were arrested and John's father, Sir Laurence, disowned his son. The war started a week later. John Eardsley was killed in the war and his father's huge fortune passed to his next of kin. Lucas was posted as \"missing in action\". The two men were not tried for the theft. Race reveals that he is the fortunate next of kin.\n\nAnne and Suzanne examine the piece of paper Anne obtained in the Underground station. The paper could refer to cabin 71, Suzanne's cabin, originally booked by a woman who did not appear. Anne connects finding the film roll in Mill House with a film canister containing uncut diamonds that was dropped into Suzanne's cabin in the early hours of the 22nd. They speculate that Harry Rayburn is the Man in the Brown Suit. Anne is attacked as she walks the deck of the ship; Harry Rayburn saves her.\n\nIn Cape Town, Anne is lured to a house at Muizenberg, where she is imprisoned. Anne escapes the next morning and returns to Cape Town. There she finds that Harry is wanted as the Man in the Brown Suit and has gone missing. Pedler offers Anne the role of his secretary on his train trip to Rhodesia; she accepts at the last second, and is reunited on the train with Race, Suzanne, and Pedler, who has another new secretary named Miss Pettigrew.\n\nIn Bulawayo, Anne receives a note from Harry which lures her out to a ravine near their hotel. She is chased and falls into the ravine. Almost a month later, Anne awakens in a hut on an island in the Zambezi with Harry Rayburn, who rescued her. Anne and Harry fall in love. Harry tells her his side of the story. Harry's island is attacked, but the two escape, and Anne returns to Pedler's party. They exchange codes to be used in future communications so that neither can be duped again. Reunited with Suzanne, Anne learns that the diamonds are with luggage sent on with Sir Eustace. She receives a telegram signed Harry telling her to meet him, but not using their code.\n\nAnne instead meets Chichester, alias Miss Pettigrew. She is led to Sir Eustace. Pedler forces Anne to write a note to Harry to lure him to his office. Harry turns up and Pedler is exultant until Anne pulls out a pistol and they capture Pedler. Race turns up with reinforcements and Pedler tries to bluff, but Race lists his crimes and the evidence. Sir Eustace escapes overnight. Anne is somewhat pleased, having a fondness for him. Race tells her that Harry is John Eardsley, not Harry Lucas, and the heir to a fortune he does not want. Harry has found his happiness with Anne, and they marry and live on the island in the Zambezi. Anne receives a letter from Sir Eustace, now living in South America.\n\n\n\"The Times Literary Supplement\" reviewed the novel in its issue of 25 September 1924. The review appreciated the \"thriller-cum-adventure\" style of the book and concluded, \"The author sets so many questions to the reader in her story, questions which will almost certainly be answered wrongly, that no one is likely to nod over it, and even the most experienced reader of romances will fail to steer an unerring course and reach the harbour of solution through the quicksands and shoals of blood, diamonds, secret service, impersonation, kidnapping, and violence with which the mystery is guarded.\"\n\nThe unnamed reviewer in \"The Observer\" (7 September 1924) wrote: \"Miss Christie has done one bold and one regrettable thing in this book. She has dispensed with Hercule Poirot, her own particular Sherlock Holmes, to whose presence and bonhomie and infallibility the success of her previous books has been mainly due.\" After comparing Poirot with Harry Rayburn, the reviewer continued by saying that the book, \"will be something of a disappointment to those who remember \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\". It is an excellent and ingenious complexity, in its way, but it might have been written by quite a number of the busy climbers of who now throng this particular slope of Parnassus. One almost suspects that Miss Christie contemplates exchanging the mantle of Conan Doyle for that of Miss Dell; a hazardous manoeuvre, for the two authoresses are very different in tastes and sympathies.\" The reviewer went on to say that, \"The plan of the book is rather confused. There is a prologue which does not link itself up with the rest of the story for quite a long time; and the idea of giving alternate passages from the diaries of the heroine and of Sir Eustace Pedler is not altogether justified by the glimpses it gives of that entertaining but disreputable character. One of the points on which some readers will have doubts is as to the plausibility of the villain: assuredly he is a novel type in that role. The book, like all Miss Christie's work, is written with spirit and humour.\"\n\nRobert Barnard said about this novel that it was \"Written during and about a trip to Southern Africa, this opens attractively with the heroine and her archeologist father (Agatha's interest in the subject was obviously pre-Max), and has some pleasant interludes with the diary of the baddie. But it degenerates into the usual stuff of her thrillers, and the plot would probably not bear close examination, if anyone were to take the trouble.\"\n\nSome additional blurbs regarding the book, and used by The Bodley Head for advertising subsequent print runs, are as follows:\n\nLike \"The Secret Adversary\", \"The Man in the Brown Suit\" is less a novel of pure detection than it is a thriller typical of its period. It follows the adventures of Anne Beddingfeld who witnesses a man killed in a subway station and the man whose appearance frightened him, as she becomes involved in a world of diamond thieves, murderers, and political intrigue in this tale set in South Africa. Colonel Race makes his first appearance in the novel; he later appears in \"Cards on the Table\", \"Sparkling Cyanide\", and \"Death on the Nile\".\n\nThe book has some parallels to incidents and settings of a round-the-world work trip taken by Christie with her first husband Archie Christie and headed by his old teacher from Clifton College, Major E A Belcher, to promote the forthcoming 1924 British Empire Exhibition. The tour lasted from 20 January to 1 December 1922. It was on the tour that Christie wrote the short stories which would form all of \"Poirot Investigates\" (1924) and most of the contents of \"Poirot's Early Cases\", published in 1974. \n\nDining with the Christies before the trip, Belcher had suggested setting a mystery novel in his home, the Mill House at Dorney and naming the book \"The Mystery of the Mill House\"; and had insisted on being in it as well. He is the inspiration for the central character Sir Eustace Pedler, having been given a title at Archie's suggestion. The Mill House also makes an appearance, albeit located in Marlow.\n\nChristie found Belcher \"childish, mean and somehow addictive as a personality: 'Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace', wrote Agatha of the fictionalised Belcher, a main character in \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". 'I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it is.'\"\n\nThe Man in the Brown Suit (1989) aired in the US on 4 January 1989, adapted by \"Alan Shayne Productions\" in association with Warner Brothers Television. It is set in a later era than the 1920s and many details are changed as a result. At least one review found the story lacking, feeling that those adaptations of Christie's novels shown on PBS fared better than this one aired on CBS in the US.\n\nAdapator: Carla Jean Wagner\nDirector: Alan Grint\n\nMain Cast:\n\n\"The Man in the Brown Suit\" was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 16 July 2007, and, on 3 December 2007 was adapted by \"Hughot\" and illustrated by \"Bairi\" (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by in 2005 under the title of \"L'Homme au complet marron\".\n\n\nFollowing completion in late 1923, \"The Man in the Brown Suit\" was first serialised in the \"London Evening News\" under the title \"Anne the Adventurous\". It ran in fifty instalments from Thursday, 29 November 1923 to Monday, 28 January 1924. There were slight amendments to the text, either to make sense of the openings of an instalment (e.g. changing \"She then...\" to \"Anne then...\"), or omitting small sentences or words. The main change was in the chapter divisions. The published book has 36 chapters whereas the serialisation has only 28 chapters.\n\nIn her 1977 \"\" Christie made a slight mistake with the name of the serialisation and refers to it as \"Anna the Adventuress\" (possibly confusing it with the 1904 book of the same name by E. Phillips Oppenheim). Irrespective of this mistake, the change from her preferred title was not of her choosing and the newspaper's choice was one that she considered to be \"as silly a title as I have ever heard\". She raised no objections, however, as the \"Evening News\" were paying her £500 (£ in current terms) for the serial rights which she and her family considered an enormous sum. At the suggestion of her first husband Archie, Christie used the money to purchase a grey, bottle-nosed Morris Cowley. She later stated that acquiring her own car ranked with dining at Buckingham Palace as one of the two most exciting incidents in her life.\n\nChristie was less pleased with the dustjacket of the book, complaining to the Bodley Head that the illustration, by an unnamed artist, looked as if the incident at the Tube Station occurred in \"mediaeval times\", when she wanted something \"more clear, definite and modern\". The Bodley Head were anxious to sign a new contract with Christie, now recognising her potential, but she wanted to move on, feeling that \"they had not treated a young author fairly.\" The US serialisation was in the \"Blue Book\" magazine in three instalments from September (Volume 39, Issue 5) to November 1924 (Volume 40, Issue 1) with each issue containing an uncredited illustration.\n\nChristie's dedication in the book reads:\n\"To E.A.B. In memory of a journey, some Lion stories and a request that I should some day write the \"Mystery of the Mill House\"\".\n\n\"E A B\" refers to Major E A Belcher (see \"References to actual history, geography and current science\" above).\n\nThe dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead both the front and back flap carried adverts for other Bodley Head novels.\n\n"}
{"id": "1914387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914387", "title": "Vow of silence", "text": "Vow of silence\n\nA vow of silence is a vow to maintain silence. Although it is commonly associated with monasticism, no major monastic order takes a vow of silence. Even the most fervently silent orders such as the Carthusians have time in their schedule for talking. Recently, the vow of silence has been embraced by some in secular society as means of protest or of deepening their spirituality. Silence is often seen as essential to deepening a relationship with God. It is also considered a virtue in some religions.\n\nIn Western Christian traditions such as Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism, the Great Silence is the period of time beginning at the canonical hour of Compline, in which votarists are silent until the first office of the next day, Lauds.\n\nPythagoras imposed a strict rule of silence on his disciples.\n\nDespite the common misconception, no major Christian monasteries or religious orders take such a vow. However, most monasteries have specific times (magnum silentium, work silence, times of prayer, etc.) and places (the chapel, the refectory, etc.) where speaking is prohibited unless absolutely necessary. Even outside of these times and places, useless and idle words are forbidden. In active orders the members speak according to the needs of their various duties.\n\nIn the Indian religions, religious silence is called \"Mauna\" and the name for a sage \"muni\" (see, for example Sakyamuni) literally means \"silent one\". In Buddhism, however, \"one does not become a sage simply because of a vow of silence\" due to the prescription for disciples to also teach the Buddhist doctrine. The vow of silence is also relevant in the training of novices and is often cited as a way to resist the allures of \"samsara\", including those posed by the opposite sex. Buddhist monks who take a vow of silence often carry an iron staff called \"khakkhara\", which makes a metallic noise to frighten away animals. Since they cannot speak, the rattle of the staff also announces their arrival when they start begging for alms.\n\nAnother vow of silence can be made to express a bold statement. This type may be to make a statement about issues such as child poverty. An example of this is The November 30th Vow of Silence for Free The Children in which students in Canada take a 24-hour vow of silence to speak up against poverty and child labour. In the United States, the Day of Silence is the GLSEN’s annual day of action to spread awareness about the effects of the bullying and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students. Students take a day-long vow of silence to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students. The Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996. From 2011 to 2017, the Day of Silence was held on the second Friday in April except for April 11, 2014; in 2018 it was observed on Friday, April 27.\n\nThe 2006 film, \"Little Miss Sunshine\", featured Dwayne, a Nietzsche-reading teenager, taking a vow of silence until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a test pilot. \n\nThe Poopsmith, a character in the long-running Web Series \"Homestar Runner\", has taken a vow of silence, and has only had two speaking roles in the 19 years the series has been running.\n\n\"The Cartoon\", a season 9 episode of \"Seinfeld\", featured Kramer taking a vow of silence.\n\nThe 2009 movie \"\" featured Snake Eyes taking a vow of silence.\n\nThe 2011 movie \"\" featured a Buddhist monk taking a vow of silence as part of the film's plot.\n\nThe 2017 television show \"The Good Place\" featured Jianyu, a Buddhist monk, taking a vow of silence.\n\nThe HBO TV series \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (Season 8, Episode 5) featured a character taking a vow of silence. The episode title was also called \"Vow of Silence\".\n\nIn the book \"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\" \"(ねじまき鳥クロニクル Nejimakitori Kuronikuru)\", perhaps the character Cinnamon Akasaka has taken a vow of silence.\n\n"}

It includes the largest and the smallest vipers in the world. Members are known for their characteristic threat displays that involve inflating and deflating their bodies while hissing and puffing loudly. The type species for this genus is \"B. arietans\", which is also the most widely distributed viper in Africa. Currently, 15 species are recognized.\n\nMembers of the genus are commonly known as African adders, African vipers, or puff adders.\n\nSize variation within this genus is extreme, ranging from the very small \"B. schneideri\", which grows to a maximum of and is perhaps the world's smallest viperid, to the very large \"B. gabonica\", which can attain a length of over and is the heaviest viper in the world.\n\nAll have a wide, triangular head with a rounded snout, distinct from the neck, and covered in small, keeled, imbricate scales. The canthus is also distinct. A number of species have enlarged rostral or supraorbital scales that resemble horns. Their eyes are relatively small. They have large nostrils that are directed outwards and/or upwards. Up to six rows of small scales separate the rostral and nasal scales. All species have a well-developed supranasal sac. The fronts of the maxillary bones are very short, supporting only one pair of recurved fangs.\n\nThese snakes are moderately to extremely stout. Their bodies are covered with keeled scales that are imbricate (overlapping) with apical pits. At midbody, the dorsal scales number 21–46. Laterally, the dorsal scales may be slightly oblique. The ventral scales, which number 112–153, are large, rounded and sometimes have slight lateral keels. Their tails are short. The anal scale is single. The paired subcaudal scales number 16-37 and are sometimes keeled laterally.\n\nPuff adders are found in Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula.\n\n\"Bitis\" species are known for their behavior of inflating and deflating their bodies in loud hissing or puffing threat displays. They are terrestrial ambush predators, and appear sluggish, but can strike with amazing speed. In contrast to the pitvipers of the subfamily Crotalinae, \"Bitis\" species appear to lack heat-sensitive organs and showed no differences in their behavior in laboratory tests towards warm and cool objects that mimicked prey.\n\nAll members are viviparous and some give birth to large numbers of offspring.\n\nAll members of this genus are dangerous – some extremely so. At least six different polyvalent antivenoms are available. Five are produced by Aventis Pasteur (France), Pasteur Merieux (France) and SAIMR (South Africa). All of these specifically protect against \"B. arietans\" and four also cover \"B. gabonica\". At least one protects specifically against bites from \"B. nasicornis\": India Antiserum Africa Polyvalent. In the past, such antivenoms have been used to treat bites from other \"Bitis\" species, but with mixed results.\n\n\"*) Not including the nominate subspecies.\"<br>\n\") Type species.\n\nOther species may be encountered in literature, such as:\n\n\nLenk et al. (1999) used molecular data (immunological distances and mitochondrial DNA sequences) to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among species of \"Bitis\". They identified four major monophyletic groups for which they created four subgenera:\n\n\nFor now, this division is of little consequence as far as the nomenclature is concerned. However, the definition of subgenera within a genus is often the sign of an impending split. Therefore, those interested in these snakes would do well to familiarize themselves with these new subgenera.\n\n"}

As far as the controversies regarding which of the remaining 11, then 12 and then more apostles after that which includes then Saul, later called Paul, Scripture itself does not say. It may very well have been that they continued to follow the Messiah as their head. Indeed, that is what the Bible itself promotes.\n\nThe following are other views on chief apostles and the religions that therefore must flow out of those beliefs. One system in common use today is used by Messianic apostles who believe James \"the Just\" was Chief Apostle, in Jerusalem, following Jesus (they use the Hebrew form of his name, Y'shua, in various spellings) return to his Father in Heaven. A similar system is used by Catholic churches worldwide, varying from Roman Catholics, to Anglican Catholics, to Coptic, Russian etc. Each with a differing view on who is, or was, a Chief Apostle originally, and sometimes, even now.\n\nA similar view introduced by minister Friedrich Krebs and can be compared to the one Apostle Peter had 2,000 years ago amongst the original Apostles (He is seen as the first Chief Apostle in the early church). Before Krebs introduced it, the title was already used in the Catholic Apostolic Church, however with a completely different meaning (as the German word \"Stamm\" means \"tribe\" and was used to describe the working areas (=tribes) of the apostles).\n\n\"Former Chief Apostles:\"\nThe function of the Chief Apostle is to lead the New Apostolic Church. On questions about the faith of New Apostolic Church members, he has the highest authority. Together with the district apostles he determines the policy of the church.\n\nThe Chief Apostle can ordain new apostles or retire them.\n\nOne of the most interesting Chief Apostles was J.G. Bischoff: at Christmas in 1950 he declared his \"Botschaft\" (\"message\"). This teaching announced that he would not die before Jesus Christ's return, during which the chosen people will be taken into His kingdom (the First Resurrection). In 1954 this teaching became official dogma. Those ministers, especially the apostles, who did not preach this message lost their positions and were excommunicated from the New Apostolic Church. The most important \"victim\" of this policy was Peter Kuhlen, the ordained successor to J.G. Bischoff. When Chief Apostle Bischoff died in 1960, his dogma about Christ's return had not been fulfilled. In 2013, Chief Apostle Wilhelm Leber made a statement in which the position of the Church is reviewed and provides that the \"message\" represented a personal position of Apostle Bischoff.\nThe various communities and congregations which evolved out of these conflicts in different countries (Australia, Europe, South-Africa) gathered in 1956 to form the United Apostolic Church.\n"}

The species were unique marsupials, of the order Peramelemorphia (bandicoots and bilbies), that had unusually thin legs yet were able to move rapidly. There are two recognised species of these marsupials, which inhabited dense vegetation on the arid and semi-arid plains of Australia. The distribution range of the genus was later reduced to an inland desert region, where it was last recorded in the 1950s; it is now presumed to be extinct.\n\nThe genus was proposed by William Ogilby in a presentation to the Linnean Society of London of a new species tentatively assigned to a genus of bandicoots, the long-nosed \"Perameles\", and being forwarded to John Gould, then at Sydney, for a more detailed examination. Ogilby submitted a drawing by the collector Major Mitchell, who also supplied extensive remarks on the form and habits of the animal, and identified the unusual pig-like toes of the forelimbs as the basis for a new genus.\nThe collection of the specimen was made at the interior of New South Wales by Mitchell, on the banks of the Murray River.\n\nThe genus name \"Chaeropus\" combines terms derived from Ancient Greek for pig and foot, a reference to the unique characteristic of the forelimbs noted by the describing author. The specific epithet \"ecaudatus\" refers to the absence of a tail, which the single specimen happened to be missing, leading to the unfortunate suggestion by the name that the marsupial did not possess them.\n\nThe recognised synonymy of the genus was published by Theodore S. Palmer in 1904.\nA nomenclatural synonym, \"Chœropus\" [\"Choeropus\"] Waterhouse, G.R. 1841, was published several years after Ogilby as an unjustified emendation; Waterhouse gives the spelling proposed by Ogilby in the same work. \nOldfield Thomas noted the inappropriate epithet \"ecaudatus\" in 1888, substituting the name \"Chœropus castanotis\" proposed by John Edward Gray as the type of the genus, but this was suppressed as a synonym by Palmer.\n\nThe vernacular description, pig-footed bandicoot, was given by Ogilby in his first description, a name ascribed by Mitchell's party.\nEuropeans settlers reported the species as resembling \"small antelopes\", a simile that was reported by Bernard Woodward as persisting until their disappearance around 1900. The names recorded from the Noongar language are boda, woda, and boodal.\nAccording to Indigenous Australian trackers, the pig-footed bandicoot was known as \"\"Landwang\" and \"Tubaija\"\" in their culture.\n\nThis genus was previously placed in the family Peramelidae, along with the bilbies, as the subfamily Chaeropodinae by McKenna and Bell (1997). However, its form is quite distinct from the Peramelidae and bilbies, and recent molecular evidence supports this distinction. It is believed to be the sister group of the rest of the Peramelmorphia and has been assigned to its own family Chaeropodidae.\n\nUntil 2019, both species were grouped under \"C. ecaudatus\" as the pig-footed bandicoot; however, a 2019 study split the genus into two species: the northern pig-footed bandicoot (\"C. yirratji\") and the southern pig-footed bandicoot (\"C. ecaudatus\").\n\nThe arrangement within the Marsupialia, with the treatment proposed in the 2019 revision, may be summarised as,\n\n\nA genus of Peramelemorphia order of marsupials, allied by a monophyletic family, and regarded as exceptional in their morphology. The direct evidence of the two species is limited to twenty nine specimens remaining at museums in Australia and overseas.\nTheir superficial appearance resembled the native bandicoots or kangaroo-rats, although very small and dainty, and comparable to the size of a young rabbit or kitten.\n\nThe feet of forelimbs resemble those of the genus \"Sus\" and the hind legs seen as similar to a horse. \nThe species had a body size of 23–26 cm and a 10–15 cm long tail. In form, they were almost bilby-like on first sight, having long, slender limbs, large, pointed ears, and a long tail. On closer examination, however, it became apparent that the pig-footed bandicoots were very unusual for marsupials. The forefeet had two functional toes with hooves, similar to the cloven hoof of a pig or deer; this is possibly due to juveniles being deposited in the pouch through external stalks, thus relieving them of using the forelimbs while as joeys. The hind feet had an enlarged fourth toe with a heavy claw shaped like a tiny horse's hoof, with the other toes being vestigial:only the fused second and third toes being useful, and that not for locomotion but for grooming.\n\nThey had broad heads, and a long yet slender snout. Their fur was coarse and straight, but not spiny. In color they varied from grizzled grey through fawn to orange-brown, the belly and underparts were white with the fur on the ears being of chestnut color.\n\nThe genus had five pairs of upper and three pairs of lower incisor teeth; the tooth shape differed between the two species. The females of the genus had eight nipples and the opening of the pouch was faced backwards, not forwards as is the case with kangaroos.\n\nDepictions of the species include a lithograph by Henry C. Richter in John Gould's \"Mammals of Australia\", published in the mid nineteenth century. \nAn unpublished illustration by Richter, under the direction of Gould, was discovered in the archives of Knowsley Hall, at one time home to a great patron of natural history, the Earl of Derby.\nThe species \"C. ecaudatus\" was selected by Peter Schouten and Tim Flannery for a series of paintings that illustrated the known information on the species appearance and habits, published in a book surveying the modern extinctions of animals.\nAnother reconstruction of the genus was produced by Schouten to illustrate the species \"C. yirratji\".\n\nThe two species were native to western New South Wales and Victoria, the southern part of the Northern Territory as well as South Australia and Western Australia. \"Chaeropus ecaudatus\" populated semi-arid southern regions of southern Australia, extending to southwest Australia, while \"C. yirratji\" populated sandy environments extending from Western Australia to the deserts in central Australia. They inhabited a wide range of habitat types: from grassy woodland and grassland plains to the spinifex country and arid flats of central Australia. Despite its wide range, the genus had a sparse distribution and was never abundant.\n\nThe number of complete specimens that can be found in museum collections is twenty nine. Historical records of collections in central and western Australia, where it was sometimes locally common, begin with a specimen obtained at the Peron Peninsula during the \"Uranie\" expedition led by Louis de Freycinet in 1818. John Gilbert recorded his observations at dense stands of \"Casuarina\" seedlings (\"Allocasuarina\" species) at the interior of the southwest, beyond Northam, but did not appear in the Avon valley, inland from the new colony at Perth, at new settlements near Toodyay, York, and the Wongan Hills area. On his second collecting expedition in the southwest he recorded the species at King George Sound, on the southern coast of Western Australia.\nThe species was not recorded in the lists produced by the Austin Expedition of 1854, although W. A. Sanford was informed of a frequently seen animal, described as the \"chestnut-eared hog’s-foot\", which Ludwig Glauert suggests was too common to merit notice in Austin's published report. Despite actively searching and collecting information on this animal, the species was not recorded by John Tunney, George Masters or Guy Shortridge in their extensive surveys of western regions during the subsequent decades.\nThe last record of \"Chaeropus\" in the Southwest Australian region was in 1898, at Youndegin, consistent with the disappearance of species in a critical weight range that succumbed to Australia's mammalian faunal collapse (1875–1925).\n\nArchaeological evidence of the genus shows a greater range during Holocene and the earlier Pleistocene epoch. Specimens were uncovered in the first examination of fossil deposits at Mammoth Cave (Western Australia), at the beginning of the twentieth century, and great extension of the known range to eastern Queensland at two sites examined a century later.\nThe appearance in the fossil fauna of eastern Queensland sites demonstrates the replacement of rainforest communities with the open grassy habitat favoured by this genus during the later Pleistocene. \nA survey of mammal fauna in the northeast of South Australia uncovered a fragment in an owl pellet buried beneath sediments.\n\nThe explorer Samuel Albert White was shown the tracks of the animal in 1921 and gained information on it habitat, being found on stony tablelands or at sand dunes in central Australia. and was able to capture one with the assistance of a local Aboriginal woman and her dogs.\nThe increasing rarity of the animal saw it included on a list of prohibited exports, either live or skin, issued by the federal government in 1921.\n\nAccording to Indigenous Australian oral tradition, pig-footed bandicoots were rare even before the arrival of Europeans on the continent and were in a serious decline even as it first came to scientific notice in the middle years of the 19th century. Two specimens of pig-footed bandicoot were obtained by local people in 1857 for Gerard Krefft, who accompanied the Blandowski Expedition. In trying to communicate the species he sought, Krefft showed a drawing to his collectors that showed the absence of a tail; the first specimens he was supplied were bandicoots with the tails removed. Despite the trouble taken in gaining living specimens, Krefft recorded his observations with an apology for eating one of them. Only a handful of specimens were collected through the second part of the 19th century, mostly from northwestern Victoria, but also from arid country in South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. By the start of the 20th century, they had become extinct in Victoria and the south-west of Western Australia. The last certain specimen was collected in 1901. By 1945, \"C. ecaudatus\" was extinct, having vanished from South Australia, and \"C. yirratji\" was reported to be limited to \"a slight foothold in central Australia\". Nevertheless, Aboriginal people report that \"C. yirratji\" survived as late as the 1950s in the Gibson Desert and the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia.\n\nThe cause of the extinction remains uncertain: neither of the two most destructive introduced exterminator species, the fox and the rabbit, had yet arrived in south-west Western Australia when the pig-footed bandicoots disappeared from that area. Feral cats were already common, which may offer an explanation; it is perhaps more likely that the decline was caused by a double habitat change. Firstly, the end of many thousands of years of Aboriginal burning which, being confined to a patchwork of small areas at any one time, had ensured both fresh new growth in the recently burnt areas and adjacent older growth for shelter and as a base for recolonisation. However, Australia's Aboriginal population had declined by around 90% during the 19th century, largely because of the introduction of European diseases, and the remaining Aborigines were often no longer permitted to carry on their traditional land-management and hunting practices. Secondly, following on the heels of the near-extermination of the Aborigines, came the introduction of vast numbers of sheep and cattle, leading to significant changes in soil structure, plant growth, and food availability.\n\nThe species was included in historical modelling of a disease outbreak, a theorised epizootic that was the primary cause of mammalian declines, to which the populations of \"Chaeropus\" would seem to have been highly susceptible. The sudden demise of these marsupials was noted by Hal Colebatch, writing in 1929 that the disappearance was not the result of direct actions of settlers but an unexplained consequence of a natural event.\nThe apparent resilience of some mammals at Kellerberrin, who reappeared after a localised collapse, did not include this genus. \nWhen modelled as a primary factor in their demise, which has no discernible secondary factors, the population had no immunity to the hypothetical epizootic.\n\nAn ethnographic survey of Aboriginal informants from central Australia in 1988 found the animal has not been seen in southern regions for around seventy years, but had persisted in the central desert regions.\n\nFew naturalist had the opportunity to observe and document the behaviour of the two species, one of the few existing accounts suggesting that it moved \"like a broken-down hack in a canter, apparently dragging the hind quarters after it\".\nThis is contradicted by the Aboriginal people of central Australia, who knew it well and reported that if disturbed, it was capable of running with considerable speed by breaking into a smooth, galloping sprint.\n\n\"Chaeropus\" moved with a distinctive gait, exaggerated by their proportionally long and slender limbs that resemble a large grazing mammal like the African antelope. Each forelimb had two functional toes and the rear limb ending in a hoof like toe, with an apparent advantage when used to quickly evade a perceived threat.\nThey were solitary, nocturnal animals that would sleep in their shelter during the day and emerge in the evening to feed, using its keen sense of smell to find food. Depending on the habitat, pig-footed bandicoots used a variety of shelters to hide from predators and for sleeping. John Gilbert found a nest site near Northam, Western Australia that he described as greatly resembling those made by quenda and marl, but with more leaves. In wooded areas and grasslands these ranged from hollow logs and nests made out of grass, while in arid treeless country this animal used to dig short, straight burrows with a nest at the end.\n\nFrom surviving eyewitness reports and analyses of gut contents, dentition, and gut structure of museum specimens, it appears that pig-footed bandicoots were the most herbivorous of the peramelemorphs; analysis based on dental morphology and tooth wear are consistent with a predominately plant-based diet. Captive specimens were fond of meat and Aborigines reported that they ate grasshoppers, ants and termites, the bulk of their diet was almost certainly leaves, roots and grasses. In captivity it was observed that they drank \"a good deal of water\".\n\nTim Flannery suggests that breeding occurred between May and June and that twins may have been the norm for this species. From the size of its pouch and comparison with other marsupials of this size, it can be inferred that pig-footed bandicoots did not carry more than four young per litter.\nCorrespondence to Ludwig Glauert, reporting its disappearance some decades earlier, suggested that the animal was extremely delicate and would die if caught and mishandled.\n"}

He painted, often in tempera, coastal views, abstracts, portraits and still-life. He was also an engraver on wood and copper. In the First World War he was involved in transferring dazzle camouflage designs onto ships for the Royal Navy, and after the war he continued to paint nautical themes.\n\nWadsworth was born on 29 October 1889 in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, and was educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh. He studied engineering in Munich between 1906 and 1907, where he studied art in his spare time at the Knirr School. This provoked a change of course, as he attended Bradford School of Art before earning a scholarship to the Slade School of Art, London. His contemporaries at the school included Stanley Spencer, CRW Nevinson, Mark Gertler, Dora Carrington and David Bomberg.\n\nWadsworth's work was included in Roger Fry's second Post-Impressionism Exhibition at the Grafton Galleries, 1912, in London, but he changed allegiance shortly after through friendship with Wyndham Lewis, and exhibited some futurist-derived paintings at the Futurist Exhibitions at the Doré Gallery. Although a member of the committee that organised a dinner in honour of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1913, he was one of a number of British painters in the nascent avant-garde that became increasingly disenchanted with the Italian's arrogance. By June of the following year, he was in a group of artists, including Lewis, who jeered Marinetti's public performance of The Battle Of Adrianople. He was a signatory of the Vorticist Manifesto published in \"BLAST\" the next month, and also supplied a review of Kandinsky's \"Concerning The Spiritual In Art\" and images to be reproduced in the magazine.\n\nThirty three days after the Vorticist Manifesto was published, war was declared on Germany. Vorticism managed to continue into 1915, with a Vorticist Exhibition, June 1915 at the Doré Gallery and a second edition of BLAST published to coincide with the show. Wadsworth contributed to both, but signed up for the navy shortly after. His fellow vorticist Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was killed at the front and Bomberg and Lewis found that their belief in the purity of the machine age was seriously challenged by the realities of the trenches. Wadsworth spent the war in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on the island of Mudros until invalided out in 1917, transferring dazzle camouflage designs onto allied ships. Known as Dazzle ships, these vessels were not camouflaged to become invisible, but instead used ideas derived from Vorticism and Cubism to confuse enemy U-boats trying to pinpoint the direction and speed of travel. Dazzle camouflage was invented and designed by Norman Wilkinson. Always a fan of modern ships, Wadsworth was to use nautical themes in his art for the rest of his career.\n\nHeralded by the major painting \"Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool\", 1919, Wadsworth moved away from the avant-garde in the 1920s, and adopted a more realistic style. Wadsworth was a member of Unit One. Towards the end of his life his work became increasingly strange and surreal, although Wadsworth never had any formal links with the official Surrealist movement.\n\nWadsworth died in 1949, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery.\n\nThe graphic designer Peter Saville had seen Wadsworth's painting \"Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool\" and was struck by the image. After suggesting the idea and title to Andy McCluskey of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Saville carried the theme over to the sleeve design of their album \"Dazzle Ships\" (1983).\n\n\n"}

His early education was at the London School of Kensington, now known as The Royal College of Art where he studied on the Architectural course under Professor Arthur Beresford Pite (1861-1934) and two years under Professor Lethaby, which brought him into contact with the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nHe was a contributor to the Omega Workshops, but was one of those breaking away with Wyndham Lewis; this breakaway began the Rebel Art Centre, with the Rebel Art Movement, somewhat akin to the Dadaists in Paris. The Rebel Art Movement transformed into the Vorticists several of his illustrations appeared in the issues of the literary magazine \"BLAST\" of which there were only two issues. There was a Manifesto, which not all of the artists involved signed up to; Etchells himself excluded his name from the manifesto. However William Roberts later painted Etchells holding the copy of \"BLAST\" in his work \"The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915\". Roberts wrote to Etchells wanting to confront Lewis about his prominence in the authorship of the magazine, to which Etchells declined since he no longer wanted anything to do with it. He, unlike many of the others from the Vorticists, remained acquainted with Roger Fry.\n\nIn his architectural practice, Etchells produced some modernist buildings, the most well known of is his designs was for 232–4 High Holborn, London (1929–30) for the advertising firm WS Crawford Ltd., a commission he had obtained through his friend Ashley Havinden (1903–73) who was the company’s art director from 1929. This was the first fully modernist office building in central London. Its clean façade was matched by a modern interior, complete with built-in furniture and stainless steel. Etchells main responsibility was the façade.\n\nEtchells's most significant work is his translation of Le Corbusier's \"Vers une architecture\" known in its English title as \"Towards a New Architecture\": This has now been re-translated by John Goodman in his version \"Toward an Architecture\" 2007. Etchells later translated another book of Corbusier's \"Urbanisme\", which in its English translation became \"The City of Tomorrow\". He gradually moved into architecture after a period of book publication, with the Haslewood Press. Later he became a church and conservation architect. He had close associations with John Betjeman who wrote his obituary. Betjeman was a tenant in one of Etchells's flats in Mayfair, this was during the period when Betjeman was a journalist with \"The Architectural Review\". One of his restorations was St Andrew's Church, Plymouth; he also restored St George's Church, Donnington, West Sussex after a fire in 1939, and St James's Church, Abinger Common, Surrey in 1950 after bomb damage during World War II.\n\nHe contributed articles to the journal \"The Studio.\", though often anonymously and to \"Artwork\".\n\nHe was an active member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) and a founding member of the Georgian Group.\n\nIn the 1930s Etchells purchased a weekend cottage in West Challow then called Holme Lea, a Queen Anne property. He lived there between 1939 and 1944, having moved out of London. During that time he acquired and renovated a second smaller house in West Challow into which he, his wife and daughter moved in 1944.\n\nHe was married to Hester Margaret Sainsbury who was a book illustrator, painter and artist known for her performances to music.\n\nMalcolm Dickson - https://aaschool.academia.edu/MalcolmDickson\n\n"}

{"id": "1914502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914502", "title": "Jessica Dismorr", "text": "Jessica Dismorr\n\nJessica Stewart Dismorr (3 March 1885 – 29 August 1939) was an English painter and illustrator. Dismorr participated in almost all of the avant-garde groups active in London between 1912 and 1937 and was one of the few English painters of the 1930s to work in a completely abstract manner. She was one of only two women members of the Vorticist movement and also exhibited with the Allied Artists Association, the Seven and Five Society and the London Group. She was the only female contributor to Group X and displayed abstract works at the 1937 Artists' International Association exhibition. Poems and illustrations by Dismorr appeared in several avant-garde publications including \"Blast\", \"Rhythm\" and an edition of \"Axis\".\n\nDismorr was born at Gravesend in Kent, the fourth of five daughters born to Mary Ann Dismorr, née Clowes, and John Stewart Dismorr, a rich businessman with property interests in South Africa, Canada and Australia. The family moved to Hampstead in the 1890s, where Jessica Dismorr was educated at Kingsley College and where she became head girl. Her mother suffered from extended periods of ill health but her father's income meant the family were free of financial worries and Jessica was able to travel extensively in Europe.\n\nDismorr attended the Slade School of Art from 1902 to 1903, before training under Max Bohm at Etaples in 1904, and at the Académie de La Palette in Paris, between 1910 and 1913, where she studied under Jean Metzinger and was in the circle around the Scottish Colourist, John Duncan Fergusson. In Paris, Dismorr shared a studio with the American artist Marguerite Thompson. In 1911, Dismorr contributed several illustrations to the avant-garde \"Rhythm\" magazine. During July 1912 she showed three landscapes, to favourable reviews, with the Allied Artists Association. Dismorr exhibited with Fergusson and S. J. Peploe in October 1912 at the Stafford Gallery in London. From 1912 to 1914 Dismorr also exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. In 1912 and 1913, Dismorr exhibited Fauvist influenced work with the Allied Artist's Association. The Fauvist influence is said to have resulted from her studies at the Académie de La Palette.\n\nDismorr met Wyndham Lewis in 1913 and by 1914 had become a member of the Rebel Art Centre. She maintained a studio in the Kings Road, Chelsea, London, as well as taking frequent trips to France. Dismorr was a signatory to the Vorticist manifesto published in the first issue of their literary magazine, \"Blast\" in 1914, and also contributed illustrations and a written piece, \"Monologue\", to the second issue in 1915. She shared the group's depiction of the dynamics of the machine and their desire to challenge the public's conservative views on art but little of her work from this period survives. The four works she contributed to the Vorticist exhibition in 1915 are now thought to be lost, as is the original of \"The Engine\" which was reproduced in an edition of \"Blast\". Both the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate hold one example each of Dismorr's work from this period and the collector John Quinn displayed several examples in New York in December 1916. Dismorr exhibited with the Vorticists again in New York in January 1917 at the Penguin Club.\n\nApart from Dismorr, the only other female member of the Vorticist group was Helen Saunders. William Roberts's painting \"The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915\", from 1961–62, shows the seven males dominating the foreground and the two women behind with Dismorr in the doorway being the furthest away. According to Kate Lechmere, the financial backer of \"Blast\" and the Rebel Art Centre, Dismorr had a difficult relationship with Wyndham Lewis, and was, along with fellow artist Helen Saunders, one of the \"little lapdogs who wanted to be Lewis’s slaves and do everything for him\". Lechmere claimed that on one occasion Dismorr stripped naked in Oxford Street to demonstrate she would do anything Lewis asked of her. Dismorr and Wyndham Lewis fell out in 1925 when she refused to purchase some drawings from him when he was short of money but they appeared to have resumed a cordial friendship in 1928 when she did lend him some funds. Robin Ody, a close friend and the executor of Dismorr's will (in which all the beneficiaries were women), summed her up as \"the Edwardian phenomenon of the new woman\". Ody considered that she did not have a physical relationship with Lewis. Lechmere's relationship with Lewis ended bitterly, and she carried out a legal struggle to recover money owed her by him. Lechmere had provided all the funds to pay for the Rebel Art Centre, where the Vorticists first met in 1914—a fact which Lewis had to admit to Christopher Nevinson who had not wanted \"any of these damned women\" in the group.\n\nDuring World War I Dismorr served as a nurse in France and then as a bilingual field officer with the American Friends Service Committee. After the war Dismorr was at the centre of the London avant-garde world, acquainted with both T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, with her poems and illustrations being published in various publications. During 1919 several poems by Dismorr were published in \"The Little Review\" but following a highly critical article by A.Y. Winters she did not submit any more for publication until the 1930s. Early in 1920 Dismorr had a handful of paintings shown, in group shows, at both the Mansard Gallery and the New Art Salon.\n\nFrom 1920 until 1924 she appears to have had no settled home and travelled throughout Europe, spending time in Paris, the Alpes-Maritimes and in both London and Folkestone. She had a nervous breakdown in 1920 and received medical advice not to paint. Lewis suspected that it was her modern style that was causing the doctors concern, and wrote to her that \"the best possible distraction for you would be to paint\".\n\nIn 1924 Dismorr began a series of water colour paintings of music hall performers, a popular subject at the time. In 1925 her first solo exhibition was held at the Mayor Gallery in London. R. H. Wilenski wrote the introduction to the exhibition cataloue. The exhibition included a series of water colours painted in France, Italy, Spain, Scotland and England. A Fauve type composition, \"Pyrenean Town\", was reproduced in reviews of the show and also shown at the Seven and Five Society. Caring for her ill mother left Dismorr little time to paint and throughout 1926 she mostly showed previously displayed works.\n\nBoth her mother and sister Blanche died in 1926 and Dismorr herself was ill during 1927. Dismorr recovered and between 1927 and 1934 exhibited some twenty-six figurative pieces with the London Group. In the early 1930s these included a series of portraits of poets, including Dylan Thomas, Cecil Day Lewis and William Empson.\n\nShe exhibited with Charles Ginner and Barbara Hepworth in the London Group, as well as with Ivon Hitchens and Ben Nicholson in the Seven and Five Society, having joined both groups in 1926. Dismorr showed with the anti-fascist Artists' International Association in the early 1930s.\n\nShe produced several pointillist self-portraits alongside portraits of her mother and female friends. One of these was of the artist Catherine Dawson Giles, whom Dismorr had known since 1904 when they met in Etaples. The two had also travelled together on painting expeditions in Europe in the 1920s. For several years Dismorr had lived at the Giles family home in London. Throughout her final years, Dismorr continued painting and exhibiting her work, which became completely abstract during the late 1930s. She exhibited with the Association Abstraction-Creation. She contributed her work, \"Related Forms\" to \"Axis\" magazine in 1937 (no 8: 25).\n\nDismorr committed suicide by hanging in London on 29 August 1939, five days before Britain declared war on Germany.\n\nA joint exhibition of works by Dismorr and Giles was held in 2000 at the Fine Art Society in London, with a catalogue written by Quentin Stevenson. Pallant House Gallery held an exhibition of the works of Dismorr and her contemporaries in early 2020. The exhibition was curated by the Gallery in partnership with Dr Alicia Foster.\n\nCatherine Heathcock's (unpublished) PhD thesis contains a complete catalogue of Dismorr's works. The letters between Dismorr and Lewis are now held at Cornell University.\n\n\n"}

After his education at Oxford, he inherited a substantial estate in Scotland was married and settled down to a quiet career as a landowning gentleman. However, with the death of his wife, when he was aged 42, he immersed himself in a military (and later political) career, during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nTaylor described Graham as \"tall, square-shouldered, and erect, his limbs sinewy and remarkably strong. His complexion was dark, with full eyebrows, firm-set lips, and an open, benevolent air. His manners and address were frank, simple, and polished\".\n\nThomas Graham was the third and only surviving son of Thomas Græme of Balgowan, in Perthshire and Lady Christian Hope, a daughter of the first Earl of Hopetoun. He was born in 1748, and was educated at home by the Reverend Fraser, minister of Moneydie, and afterwards by James Macpherson, the collector and translator of Ossian's poems. He went up to Christ Church, Oxford in 1766, and the following year he inherited the family estate following the death of his father.\n\nOn leaving college, he spent several years on the Continent, where he learnt French, German and Spanish. On his return to Scotland he applied himself to the management and improvement of his estate, enclosing his lands, erecting farmhouses and offices, granting leases to his tenants, encouraging them to implement improved methods of husbandry, and to cultivate potatoes and turnips on a large scale, which had hitherto been regarded as garden plants. He also set himself to cultivate improved breeds of horses, cattle, and sheep.\n\nIn 1785, he purchased the estate of Lynedoch or Lednock, situated in the valley of the Almond, where he planted trees and oak coppices, and improved the sloping banks bordering the stream. Fond of horses and dogs, and distinguished for his skill in country sports, he rode with the foxhounds, and accompanied the Duke of Atholl—who subsequently became his brother-in-law—in grouse-shooting and deer-stalking on the Atholl moors. He later said that he owed much of that education of the eye with reference to ground and distances, a useful talent for a military man, to his deer-hunting at this period of his life in the Forest of Atholl.\n\nIn a 1772 by-election, Graham stood as a Whig a candidate for Perth, in opposition to James Murray of Strowan, brother of the Duke of Atholl, but was defeated by a majority of only six votes out of 100. He remained active in the political field but withdrew shortly before the general election of 1774, having become engaged to the Honorable Mary Cathcart, second daughter of the 9th Lord Cathcart, whose sister was betrothed to the 3rd Duke of Atholl's son and heir. Two years later in 1774 he married Mary and on the same day her elder sister became Duchess of Atholl. \"Jane,\" wrote Lord Cathcart, \"has married, to please herself, John, Duke of Atholl, a peer of the realm; Mary has married Thomas Graham of Balgowan, the man of her heart, and a peer among princes.\" A solicitous husband, when his wife discovered on the morning of an Edinburgh ball that she had left her jewel-box at Balgowan, Graham rode the to and from Balgowan using relays of horses to ensure that she would have her jewellery at the ball.\nHer portrait by Thomas Gainsborough was highly acclaimed when exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777. The painting now hangs in the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh.\n\nGraham spent the next eighteen years as a quiet country gentleman, spending his time on riding and sports, studying the classics and making occasional visits to London and Edinburgh. When his carriage was stopped in Park Lane, London by a highwayman demanding money, jewels, and watches at gunpoint, while two accomplices seized the horses’ heads, Graham, who was on the opposite side of the carriage, leapt across the ladies to the carriage-door, and collaring the assailant, threw him to the ground. Then, drawing his sword, which at the time formed part of a dress suit, he threatened to run the man through, if his associates holding the horses’ heads attempted to come to his assistance. They immediately fled, and the prostrate highwayman was arrested.\n\nMary Graham's health began to decline, and in the spring of 1792, on the recommendation of her medical adviser, she went to the south of France with her husband and sister. However, during the voyage she died off the coast near Hyères, France on 26June 1792. Her sorrowing husband hired a barge to take the casket to Bordeaux but near Toulouse a group of French soldiers opened the coffin and disturbed the body. He closed the casket and returned home to deposit her remains in a mausoleum, which he built in the churchyard of Methven. Graham would himself be laid in the same tomb fifty years later.\n\nMary Graham is commemorated in a four-part Scottish fiddle tune composed in her honor, entitled \"The Honourable Mrs. Graham of Balgowan.\"\n\nThe loss of his wife preyed deeply upon Graham's mind, and first he set out for twelve-months of foreign travel. However, still overwhelmed by great sorrow, and now in his forty-third year, he tried to drown the thought of his loss by adopting a military career. Before the incident with Mary's coffin near Toulouse, Graham had sympathised with the French and their revolutionary ideals but from that point on he detested them and saw his military career as a way to take revenge.\n\nSir Walter Scott, in his \"The Vision of Don Roderick,\" refers to the romantic motive which led the grieving husband of Mrs. Graham to devote himself to a military career:\n\nIn early 1793 he wrote to Charles O'Hara, seeking passage to Gibraltar, of which the latter was lieutenant-governor and sailed aboard the \"Resistance\" with Lord St Helens, ambassador to Spain. After France declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic on 1February 1793, the British fleet under Admiral Samuel Hood assembled at Gibraltar. On his arrival there, Graham volunteered and went with the navy to Toulon, where he acted as \"aide-de-camp\" to Lord Mulgrave and fought in the defence of the town. According to Sir Gilbert Elliot, Graham \"left the highest character possible both for understanding and courage\".\n\nAt Toulon, Graham distinguished himself by his courage and energy: for instance, on one occasion, when a private soldier was killed, Graham snatched up his musket and took his place at the head of the attacking column. In a general order referring to the repulse of an attack by the French on an important fort, Mulgrave expressed \"his grateful sense of the friendly and important assistance which he had received in many difficult moments from Mr. Graham, and to add his tribute of praise to the general voice of the British and Piedmontese officers of his column, who saw with so much pleasure and applause the gallant example which Mr. Graham set to the whole column, in the foremost point of every attack\".\n\nIt was also at Toulon that Graham first became acquainted with his lifelong friend, Rowland Hill, then a captain, who ultimately became Viscount Hill, and commander-in chief of the British army.\n\nAfter returning home in November 1793, with the support of Henry Dundas, Secretary of State for War, who had married his first cousin the previous year, he was given the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel and raised the first battalion of the 90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers), (Balgowan's 'Grey Breeks,' as they were called), although the addition of a second battalion was to put significant pressure on his finances. Rowland Hill became a major in the regiment, which was first deployed as part of the 1795 Quiberon Expedition. The following year they were dispatched to support the French Royalist Lieutenant-general François de Charette in his struggle with the Republicans.\n\nIn late 1795 the regiment went to Gibraltar on garrison duty, a role Graham soon tired of. He obtained permission to join the Austrian army on the Rhine as British Commissioner. In this capacity he shared in the disastrous campaign of 1796, and afterward assisted Wurmser in the defence of Mantua, when it was besieged by the French under Napoleon. The garrison was reduced to the greatest extremities from want of provisions, and Graham undertook the perilous duty of conveying intelligence to the Imperial General Alvinzi, at Bassano, distant, of their desperate situation.\n\nHe left the fortress wearing a country cloak over his uniform and on 24December, amid rain and sleet, he crossed the Mincio in a boat that was repeatedly stranded due to the darkness. He travelled by foot during the night, wading through deep swamps, and crossing numerous watercourses and the Po, in constant danger of losing his way, or of being shot by the French pickets. At daybreak he concealed himself until nightfall, when he resumed his journey. After surmounting numerous hardships and perils, he at length reached in safety, on 4January, the headquarters of the Austrian general. However, on the 14th the Austrians were defeated and soon after Mantua was forced to surrender.\n\nOn the political front, with the support of the Duke of Atholl, in 1796 he was returned to parliament unchallenged, despite Dundas' wishing to secure the seat for his own son. Graham insisted that Atholl's support had no effect on his independence and he later wrote that at the time he remained firmly in support of the war but \"at the same time never to abandon those Whig principles which had brought about the revolution of 1688.\"\n\nColonel Graham now returned to Scotland, but in the autumn of 1797 he rejoined his regiment at Gibraltar. In the following year he took part, under Sir Charles Stuart, in the capture of Minorca, where he greatly distinguished himself.\n\nHe then repaired to Sicily, and obtained the warmest acknowledgements of the King and Queen of Naples for his effective exertions on their behalf. In 1798 he was entrusted with the charge of the operations against the important island of Malta, which was at that time in the possession of the French. With the local rank of brigadier-general, he had under his command the 30th and 89th Regiments of foot, Alexander Hamilton as his Brigade Major and some corps embodied under his immediate direction.\n\nOwing to the great strength of the island, he was obliged to resort to a blockade, and after a siege lasting nearly two years, the garrison were compelled by famine to surrender in September 1800. Thereafter the island remained an important part of the British Empire until it achieved independence in 1964. Colonel Graham's services were very shabbily acknowledged by the Government of that day, who reserved their patronage and honours for the officers belonging to their own political party.\n\nIn the summer of 1801 he proceeded to Egypt, where his regiment (the 90th) had greatly distinguished itself under Sir Ralph Abercromby, but he did not arrive until the campaign had terminated by the capitulation of the French army. He availed himself of the opportunity, however, to make a tour in that country and in Turkey. He spent some time in Constantinople, whence he travelled on horseback to Vienna—a journey which in later years he used to mention as one of the most agreeable rides he had ever enjoyed.\n\nAfter spending some time in the discharge of his parliamentary duties, and in attending to the improvement of his estates, Colonel Graham was stationed with his regiment in Ireland, and was then sent to the West Indies, where he remained for three years. When the Ministry of \"All the Talents\" was dismissed in 1807, on account of the favour they had shown for the Roman Catholic claims to equal privileges, Colonel Graham supported their policy, and denounced as hypocrisy the cry of \"No Popery\" raised by Mr. Perceval. But his approval of the proceedings of the Whig Ministry, and of Roman Catholic emancipation did not find favour with the Perthshire electors—a small body in those days—and on the dissolution of Parliament in May 1807, Colonel Graham declined to seek re-election, and Lord James Murray was returned without opposition in his stead.\n\nIn 1808 Colonel Graham accompanied Sir John Moore as his aide-de-camp to Sweden, and then to Spain. He served with Moore throughout the whole of his campaign, terminating in the arduous and trying retreat to Corunna, in which Graham's services were especially valuable to the harassed troops. As Sheridan said in the House of Commons, \"In the hour of peril Graham was their best adviser; in the hour of disaster Graham was their surest consolation\".\n\nWhen Sir John Moore received his death-wound at the battle of Corunna, Colonel Graham was at his right hand, and had his left hand on the mane of Sir John's horse. He at once rode away for medical assistance. Before he returned his dying general missed him, and anxiously asked, \"Are Colonel Graham and my aides-de-camp safe?\"—one of his last inquiries. Moore's body was carried to Colonel Graham's quarters, and Graham was one of the select company who witnessed Moore's burial on the rampart of the citadel of Corunna.\n\nAfter his return to England, Colonel Graham was promoted to the rank of major general, and was appointed, in the summer of 1809, to command a division under Lord Chatham, in the fatal Walcheren expedition. An attack of malaria fever, however, compelled him to return home.\n\nOn his recovery he was raised to the rank of lieutenant general, and was sent to Spain, to take command of the British and Portuguese troops in Cádiz, which was at that time closely invested by the French. The British Government attached great importance to the possession of Cádiz, as it was Britain's last stronghold in the Iberian Peninsula. But, as Sir William Napier remarked, while \"money, troops, and a fleet—in fine, all things necessary to render Cádiz formidable—were collected, yet to little purpose, because procrastinating jealousy, ostentation, and a thousand absurdities, were the invariable attendants of Spanish armies and government\".\n\nGeneral Graham resolved to make an effort to raise the siege by attacking the rear of the besieging army, and in February 1811, he sailed from Cádiz with a force of upwards of 4,000 men, accompanied by 7,000 Spanish troops, under General La Pena, to whom, for the sake of unanimity, the chief command was conceded. The allied troops assembled at Tarifa, in the Straits of Gibraltar, and, moving northward, they arrived, on the morning of 5 March, at the heights of Barrosa, which were on the south of Cádiz and of the lines of the besieging army.\n\nOn the instructions of the Spanish general, Graham's force moved down from the position of Barossa to that of the Torre de Bermeja, about half-way to the Santi Petri river, in order to secure the communication across that river. While marching through the wood towards the Bermeja, Graham received notice that the enemy was advancing in force towards the height of Barrosa. As that position was the key of that of Santi Petri, Graham immediately countermarched, in order to support the troops left for its defence; but before the British force could get themselves quite disengaged from the wood, he saw to his astonishment the Spanish troops under La Pena abandoning the Barrosa hill, which the French left wing was rapidly ascending.\n\nAt the same time their right wing stood in the plain on the edge of the wood, within cannon-shot. \"A retreat,\" as he says, \"in the face of such an enemy, already within reach of the easy communication by the sea-beach, must have involved the whole allied army in all the danger of being attacked during the unavoidable confusion of the different corps arriving on the narrow ridge of the Bermeja at the same time. Trusting\", as he says, \"to the known heroism of British troops, regardless of the numbers and position of the enemy\", General Graham determined on an immediate attack.\n\nIn the centre a powerful battery of ten guns, under Major Duncan, opened a most destructive fire upon General Leval's division, which, however, continued to advance in very imposing masses, but was completely defeated by a determined charge of the British left wing; and the eagle of the 8th regiment of light infantry, and a howitzer, were captured by the British. A reserve formed up beyond the narrow valley, across which the French were closely pursued, were the next to share the same fate. Meanwhile, the right wing was no less successful. The French General Ruffin's division, confident of success, met it on the ascent of the hill, and, after a sanguinary conflict, was driven from the heights in confusion, leaving two pieces of cannon in the hands of the British.\n\n\"No expressions of mine\", said General Graham, in his despatch to the Earl of Liverpool, \"could do justice to the conduct of the troops throughout. Nothing less than the almost unparalleled exertions of every officer, the invincible bravery of every soldier, and the most determined devotion to the honour of his Majesty's arms in all, could have achieved this brilliant success against such a formidable enemy so posted\".\n\n\"The contemptible feebleness of La Pena\", says Sir William Napier, \"furnished a surprising contrast to the heroic vigour of Graham, whose attack was an inspiration rather than a resolution—so sure, so sudden was the decision, so swift, so conclusive was the execution\".\n\nThe French lost about three thousand men in this action, and six pieces of cannon and an eagle were captured, along with nearly five hundred prisoners, among whom were Generals Ruffin and Rosseau. The loss on the side of the victors was two hundred killed, and upwards of nine hundred were wounded. Had it not been for the actions of the Spanish general, the victory might have had the effect of raising the blockade of’ Cádiz. \"Had the whole body of the Spanish cavalry\", wrote Graham, \"with the horse artillery, been rapidly sent by the sea-beach to form on the plain, and to envelop the enemy’s left; had the greatest part of the infantry been marched through the pine wood to the rear of the British force, to turn his right, he must either have retired instantly, or he would have exposed himself to absolute destruction; his cavalry greatly encumbered, his artillery lost, his columns mixed and in confusion; and a general dispersion would have been the inevitable consequence of a close pursuit. But the movement was lost\".\n\nLord Wellington, in a dispatch to General Graham, says \"I beg to congratulate you and the brave troops under your command on the signal victory which you gained on the 5th instant. I have no doubt whatever that their success would have had the effect of raising the siege of Cádiz, if the Spanish troops had made any effort to assist them; and I am equally certain, from your account of the ground, that if you had not decided with the utmost promptitude to attack the enemy, and if your attack had not been a most vigorous one, the whole allied army would have been lost\".\n\nThe Spanish general, in order to screen himself from criticism, circulated less damning accounts of his own role in the battle, which General Graham refuted by publishing in Spanish, as well as in English, his dispatch to Lord Liverpool, along with a letter to the British envoy, in vindication of his conduct. Lord Wellington mentions that La Pena was to be brought to a court-martial, where he was acquitted but stripped of command. The Cortez voted to General Graham the title of grandee of the first class; he, however, declined the honour. For his brilliant victory at the Battle of Barrosa he received the thanks of Parliament, in his place as a member of the House of Commons.\n\nShortly afterwards Graham joined the army under Wellington, and was appointed second in command. In January 1812, he took part in the siege and capture of Ciudad Rodrigo, and Wellington declared that he was much indebted to him for the success of the enterprise. Three months later he and his friend General Hill received the Order of the Bath. A problem with his eyes, from which he had been suffering for some time, made it necessary for Graham to return home at this juncture.\n\n\"I cannot avoid feeling the utmost concern,\" wrote Wellington to him, \"that this necessity should have become urgent at this moment, and that I should now be deprived of your valuable assistance\".\n\nAt the general election in October 1812, Graham contested the county of Perth with Mr. Drummond (afterwards Viscount of Strathallan), but though he was supported by a number of influential Tories, he lost the election by a majority of seven votes.\n\nHis visit to Scotland had the effect of restoring his eyesight, and in May 1813, he rejoined the army at Frinada, on the frontiers of Portugal, bringing with him the insignia of the Order of the Garter to Lord Wellington. On 22May the British force quit Portugal and moved upon Vitoria in three divisions. The left wing, which was commanded by Sir Thomas Graham, had to cross three large rivers—the Douro, the Esla, and the Ebro—and had to force positions of great strength among the passes of the mountains, continually pressing round the right wing of the retiring French army. General Graham took a prominent part in the battle of Vitoria (21 June), when the French were beaten \"before the town, in the town, about the town, and out of the town\"; and, by carrying the villages of Gamarra and Abechuco at the point of the bayonet, he intercepted the retreat of the enemy by the high road to Bayonne, and compelled them to turn to that leading to Pampeluna.\n\nHe was shortly after directed to conduct the siege of the strong fortress of San Sebastian, which was defended with great gallantry and skill by General Rey. The first assault, which took place on 25 July, was repulsed with heavy loss, and the siege had in consequence to be raised for a time. It was renewed, however, after the defeat of Marshall Soult in the battles of the Pyrenees, and a second attempt to carry the fortress by storm was made on 31August. The breach was found to present almost insuperable obstacles, and the storming party strove in vain to effect a lodgement. In this almost desperate state of the attack, General Graham ordered a heavy fire of artillery to be directed against the curtain wall, passing only a few feet over the heads of the British troops in the breach. This novel expedient was completely successful. Taking advantage of an explosion on the rampart caused by the fire of the guns, which created confusion among the enemy, the assailants gained a footing on the wall, and after a bloody struggle, which lasted two hours, forced their way into the town.\n\nOn 31August the French troops were forced to retreat from the town to their stronghold on the hill and fortress Urgull. When it seemed that damage to the town and its dwellers was limited, many of the allied rank-and-file as evidenced by local witnesses went on a rampage spree, taking to killing (estimated 1,000 civilians), looting, raping the women and burning almost the whole town to the ground, a mayhem lasting for a week. On 9 September the Governor Rey surrendered the citadel, and the garrison, reduced to one-third of their number, marched out with the honours of war. The reduction of this important place cost the British three thousand eight hundred men in killed and wounded. A candle-lit memorial event is held nowadays every 31 August, mourning these tragic days.\n\nAt the crossing of the Bidasoa separating France and Spain, General Graham commanded the left wing of the British army, and, after an obstinate conflict, succeeded in establishing his troops on French territory. However, the return of the complaint in his eyes, and the general state of his health, obliged him to resign his command and return home. In return for his services, for the third received the thanks of Parliament, and the freedom of the cities of London and Edinburgh was conferred upon him.\n\nHis health recovered enough that early in 1814 he was able to take the command of the British forces in the Netherlands, during which period he supported Bülow's attack on Hoogstraten. On 8March Graham's attempt to carry the strong fortress of Bergen op Zoom by a night attack ended in failure. In his dispatch to Downing Street he wrote:\n\"My Lord, It becomes my painful task to report to your Lordship, that an attack on Bergen-op Zoom, which seemed at first to promise complete success, ended in failure, and occasioned a severe loss to the 1st division, and to Brigadier-General Gore’s brigade. It is unnecessary for me to state the reasons which determined me to make the attempt to carry such a place by storm, since the success of two of the columns, in establishing themselves on the ramparts, with very trifling loss, must justify the having inclined the risk for the attainment of so important an object, as the capture of such a fortress.\"\n\nOn 3May 1814, he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Lynedoch of Balgowan in the County of Perth, but, in keeping with his disinterested and high-minded character, he declined the grant of £2,000 a year, to himself and to his heirs, which was voted as usual to accompany the title. British and foreign honours followed: a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, of the Spanish Order of St. Ferdinand, and of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword. He was raised to the full rank of general in 1821 and nominated colonel of the 58th Foot in 1823, followed by the 14th Foot in 1826, which he exchanged in 1834 for the colonelcy of the Royals. He was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1813, and in 1829 appointed Governor of Dumbarton Castle.\n\nHe was noted for his vigour in his old age. He travelled frequently, visiting Italy, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. In 1841, aged 94, he travelled through France to Genoa and Rome. His riding-horses were sent on to Rome, and he rode frequently in the Campagna. He died at his London home in Stratton Street on 18 December 1843, aged 95, after a very short illness: he rose and dressed himself on the day of his death. He was buried near his family home in a large and specially commissioned stone vault in Methven churchyard.\n\nThe barony of Lynedoch died with him.\n\nIn 1645, Bessie Bell, daughter of the Laird of Kinvaid, was on a visit to Mary Gray, at her father's house at Lednock, now called Lynedoch, when the plague broke out in the country. Taking alarm at the report, the two young ladies, in order to avoid the deadly infection, set to work and built themselves a bower, which they \"theekit wi' rashes\" according to the ballad, in a very retired and romantic spot known as the Burn Braes, about three quarters of a mile west from Lynedoch House. Here they lived in safety for some time, whilst the plague raged with great fury. But, ultimately, they caught the infection from a young gentleman of Perth, who, it is said, was in love with the one or the other. According to custom in cases of plague, the bodies did not receive the ordinary form of sepulture. It seems that they were allowed to lie in the open and \"beik fornenst the sun\", as the ballad avers, until the flesh had disappeared and only the bone skeletons remained, when these were taken with safety and put beneath the green sod of the Dronach-haugh, at the foot of the brae of the same name, and near to the bank of the river Almond.\n\nAfter the Lynedoch estate passed into Graham's possession in 1787, on his return from a pilgrimage abroad he found that the wall erected round the graves by Major Barry half a century before had fallen into a dilapidated state. He had the remains of the wall removed and a neat stone parapet and iron railings, 5 feet high, placed round the spot and covered the graves with a stone slab, on which was inscribed the words, \"They lived, they loved, they died\".\n\nThe valley containing the township of Lyndoch in the Barossa Valley in South Australia was named \"Lynedoch Vale\" by Colonel William Light, Surveyor General of South Australia, in December 1837 in recognition of his esteemed friend, Lord Lynedoch, who was his Captain at the Battle of Barrosa. The nearby ranges were named \"Barrosa Ranges\". Both names were mis-spelt resulting in the unique names Lyndoch and Barossa.\n\nGraham has a house named after him at the English Independent school Wellington College.\n\nGraham is portrayed as a major character in Bernard Cornwell's \"Sharpe's Fury\" published in 2006. Cornwell portrays him as an affable Scottish patriot, who lends assistance to fictional hero Richard Sharpe throughout the novel.\n\n\n\n"}

She studied at the Slade School of Art in 1907, attending three days a week till the Spring term. She later attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts which offered more technical training than the Slade. By 1912 Saunders' work had become \"recognisably Post Impressionist\", and in February her painting \"Rocks, North Devon\" was accepted by The Friday Club (an exhibiting group set up by Vanessa Bell). She exhibited works at Galerie Barbazanges and at the Allied Artists Association.\n\nSaunders exhibited in the Twentieth Century Art exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1914, one of the first British artists to work in a nonfigurative style. In 1915 she became associated with the Vorticists, signing their manifesto in the first edition of the literary magazine \"BLAST\" and contributing to their inaugural exhibition. She and Jessica Dismorr were the only female members. Saunders was fluent in both French and German and during World War I worked in the office of the United Kingdom Government Censor.\n\nSaunders exhibited with the London Group in 1916, but from 1920 she increasingly turned away from the avant-garde and adopted a more realist style, working in still life, landscapes and portraiture, and latterly exhibiting with the Holborn Art Society.\nDespite her long career, fewer than 200 of her works are currently known. She was included in the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University when it hosted an exhibition entitled \"The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914-18\" in late 2010. Saunders died of accidental coal gas poisoning at her home in Holborn, London, on 1 January 1963. Later that year, her sister Ethel donated three of her Vorticist drawings to the Tate Gallery, and one to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. \n\nIn 1996 Richard Cork wrote:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1914528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914528", "title": "Nitrilase", "text": "Nitrilase\n\nNitrilase enzymes (nitrile aminohydrolase; ) catalyse the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids and ammonia, without the formation of \"free\" amide intermediates. Nitrilases are involved in natural product biosynthesis and post translational modifications in plants, animals, fungi and certain prokaryotes. Nitrilases can also be used as catalysts in preparative organic chemistry. Among others, nitrilases have been used for the resolution of racemic mixtures. Nitrilase should not be confused with nitrile hydratase (nitrile hydro-lyase; ) which hydrolyses nitriles to amides. Nitrile hydratases are almost invariably co-expressed with an amidase, which converts the amide to the carboxylic acid. Consequently, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish nitrilase activity from nitrile hydratase plus amidase activity.\n\nNitrilase was first discovered in the early 1960s for its ability to catalyze the hydration of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Although it was known at the time that nitrilase could operate with wide substrate specificity in producing the corresponding acid, later studies reported the first NHase (nitrile hydratase) activity exhibited by nitrilase. That is, amide compounds could also be formed via nitrile hydrolysis. Further research has revealed several conditions that promote amide formation, which are outlined below.\n\nBelow is a list of steps involved in transforming a generic nitrile compound with nitrilase:\n\nMost nitrilases are made up of a single polypeptide ranging from 32-45 kDa, and its structure is an ⍺-β-β-⍺ fold. The favored form of the enzyme is a large filament consisting of 6-26 subunits. Nitrilase exploits the lys-cys-glu catalytic triad which is essential for its active site function and enhancing its performance.\n\nThe structure of a thermoactive nitrilase from P. abyssi consists of a 2-fold symmetric dimer in which each subunit contains 262 residues. Similar to other nitrilases in the nitrilase family, each subunit has an ⍺-β-β-⍺ sandwich fold; when the two subunits come together and interact, the protein forms a ‘super-sandwich’ (⍺-β-β-⍺-⍺-β-β-⍺) structure. In order to dimerize, the C-terminals of each subunit extend out from the core and interact with each other, and this is largely made possible by the salt bridges formed between arginine and glutamate residues.\n\nAlthough the exact binding mechanism to the nitrile substrate still remains unknown, by drawing comparisons between the sequence and structure with other nitrilases, the catalytic triad was determined to consist of Glu 42, Lys 113, and Cys 146. With the aid of protein modeling programs, Glu 42 was observed to be the catalytic base in activating the nucleophile (Cys 146) based on the relatively short distance between the O in Glu and S in Cys. Likewise, Lys 113 was inferred to be the catalytic acid responsible for proton transfer to the substrate.\n\nNitrilases have critical roles in plant-microbe interactions for defense, detoxification, nitrogen utilization, and plant hormone synthesis. In plants, there are two distinguishable groups in regard to substrate specificity: those with high hydrolytic activity towards arylacetonitriles and those with high activity towards β-cyano--alanine. NIT1, 2, and 3 of the \"A. thaliana\" species are examples of the first group of plant nitrilases (arylacetonitrilases) which hydrolyze the nitriles produced during the synthesis or degradation of cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. The arylcetonitrile substrates for these particular enzymes consist of phenylpropionitrile and other products that result from glucosinolate metabolism. NIT4 however, belongs to the second group of plant nitrilases and is critical for cyanide detoxification in plants.\n\nMoreover, microbes could also potentially utilize nitrilase for detoxifying and assimilating nitriles and cyanide that exist in the plant environment. An example of this is the β-cyano--alanine nitrilase by the plant bacterium \"P. fluorescens\" SBW25. Although it is unknown whether this plant bacterium encounters toxic levels of β-cyano-ʟ-alanine in natural settings, nitrilase activity has been observed in cyanogenic plants; thus, it seems that the nitrilase serves as a predominant mechanism for detoxifying cyanide instead of β-cyano-ʟ-alanine. Other bacterial applications of nitrilases produced by plant-associated microorganisms include the degradation of plant nitriles for a carbon and nitrogen source. \"P. fluorescens\" EBC191 hydrolyzes many arylacetonitriles, namely mandelonitrile, which serves as a defense against herbivores.\n"}

If this occurs frequently or repeatedly over an extended period of time, a large number of handles may be marked in-use and thus unavailable, causing performance problems or a crash.\n\nThe term is derived from memory leak. Handle leaks, like memory leaks, are specific instances of resource leaks.\n\nOne cause of a handle leak is when a programmer mistakenly believes that retrieving a handle to an entity is simply obtaining an unmanaged reference, without understanding that a count, a copy, or other operation is actually being performed. Another occurs because of poor exception handling design patterns when programmers do not consider that when an exception occurs and a sub routine is exited prematurely, the cleanup code at the end of the routine may not be executed.\n\nAn example of this might be retrieving a handle to the display device. Programmers might use this handle to check some property (e.g. querying the supported resolutions), and then simply proceed on without ever releasing the handle. If the handle was just a pointer to some data structure with no additional management, then allowing the handle to pass out of scope would not cause an issue. However, in many cases, such handles must be explicitly closed or released to avoid leaking resources associated with them; the exact requirements for what must be done with a handle varies by interface.\n"}

After the United States concluded a friendship treaty with Samoa in 1878, Germany negotiated her own Favorite Nation Treaty in 1879 with the same Samoan faction as the U.S., while later in 1879 the Anglo-Samoan treaty was completed with a rival faction. Contentions among the whites in Samoa, plus native factional strife led to side-choosing that became deadly warring with the introduction of modern weapons.\n\nWashington conference of 1887\n\nTo attempt to resolve some of the problems, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom agreed to a conference at Washington in June 1887. After the surfacing of serious disagreements among the parties, the conference adjourned without results. Fighting by nationals of the three powers with their factional local allies led to a conflict that was only tempered by the Apia hurricane of 1889 that wrecked warships on the verge of hostilities.\n\nTreaty of Berlin of 1889\n\nThe seriousness of the situation was finally recognized and German foreign minister Count Herbert von Bismarck (chancellor Otto von Bismarck's son) proposed to reconvene the adjourned Washington conference of 1887. He invited U.S. and British representatives to Berlin in April 1889. Bismarck's pragmatic approach proposed protection for life, property, and commerce of the treaty participants and relegated native government and their unstable \"kings\" to the Samoans, with which the British concurred. The United States insisted on a three powers authority while preserving native rights. In the Treaty of Berlin of 1889 thus a joint protectorate or condominium was declared, with a European/American chief justice, a municipal council for Apia, and with the \"free right of the natives to elect their Chief or King\" as the signatory to the act, thus the treaty professed to recognize a Samoan independent government.\n\nNo sooner was the native royal figurehead appointed, and after disturbances restored, the other chiefs went into rebellion and civil war ensued. By the end of the 19th century, the failure of the arrangement was freely admitted by the governments of the three powers since the principal protagonists in Samoa acted directly for their own interests, frequently overruling the officials of the condominium. A dissolution of the condominium created by the \"entangling alliance\" was now in play.\n\nThe German government \"had never made a secret of their belief that international control of Samoa was visionary and impractical ... and they began a series of diplomatic moves intended to eliminate it altogether.\" German diplomats in Washington had ascertained during the summer of 1899 that the United States administration was satisfied with obtaining the island of Tutuila with its key asset, the existing coaling station at Pago Pago. With \"partitioning of Samoa\" by then the prevailing understanding, the United States expressed no objections to Britain and Germany \"coming to a preliminary agreement.\"\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II had accepted an invitation to visit England in November 1899 and his government insisted that an agreement on Samoa should be concluded before his departure for Britain. A settlement was reached at London by 9 November and signed on 14 November. It was therefore this Anglo-German agreement on Samoa in tandem with the informal understanding with the United States that partitioned Samoa. It only remained for the three powers to negotiate a tripartite convention in order to secure the approval of the United States to the whole agreement. The Tripartite Convention of 1899 was duly constituted and documents were signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 by the U.S. Secretary of State John Hay, Baron Theodor von Holleben, German ambassador to the United States, and Sir Julian Pauncefote, British ambassador to the United States, with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900.\n\nUnited States:\n\nGerman Empire:\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nThese treaty arrangements of the Tripartite Convention of 1899 stayed in place until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\n\n\n"}

They are small, basically dull green parrots differentiated by patches of other colours, and are commonly known as grass parrots. The genus has some sexual dichromatism, with males having brighter hues.\n\nSometimes the broad-tailed parrots are considered a subfamily. In this case, \"Neophema\" and Bourke's parrot are united in the tribe Neophemini. mtDNA sequence data (Miyaki \"et al.\" 1998) suggests that the former may be correct, but the latter almost certainly is not. Rather, it appears, the group would need to include more closely related forms, such as the budgerigar and the \"Pezoporus\" ground-parrots. However, while Joseph \"et al.\" (2011) also found \"Neophema\" to be related both Bourke's parrot and ground-parrots and form part of the tribe Pezoporini, they are not related to the budgerigar.\n\nThere are 6 or 7 species:\n\n\nDepending on the author, \"Neopsephotus bourkii\" (Bourke's parrot) may also be considered a member of this genus.\n\nThe scarlet-chested parrot, turquoise parrot and elegant parrot are all commonly raised and bred in captivity with a number of unusual colour forms arising. The members of this genus are not altogether easy to keep, being tender birds that may die without apparent cause, succumbing to mobbing by more robust aviary mates or diseases. This has hampered captive propagation efforts, e.g. in the case of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot.\n\nThey are certainly not \"beginner's birds\" and will usually not thrive if they are not provided with a spacious aviary where a small flock can be kept in company of a few other small and harmless birds. It is possible to keep a pair or a single bird in a cage, but they will be sluggish and unhealthy if they are not let out to fly and socialize with humans frequently. Trade in wild-caught specimens is strongly restricted; in any case, these should be rejected because they are extremely tough to accustomize to aviary conditions. It is usually impossible, even for expert aviculturalists, to keep wild-caught birds alive for more than a few months. Captive-bred birds of several species are available, and these are far more hardy, though inexperienced aviculturalists should avoid them nonetheless.\n\nPopular in Australia and internationally, \"Neophema\" are sometimes referred to as 'grass parakeets' in avicultural literature. The most easily bred are Bourke's parrot (as \"Neophema\"), scarlet-chested parrot (\"N. splendida\"), the turquoise parrot (\"N. pulchella\"), and elegant parrot (\"N. elegans\"), the most difficult and uncommon captive is the rock parrot (\"N. petrophila\"). Aside from Bourke's parrot, all are distinguished as predominantly green birds. The orange-bellied parrot has not been commercially available due to rarity and legal restriction.\n\n"}

The West African giraffes once lived in Algeria and Morocco in ancient periods until their extinctions due to the Saharan dry climate. It is isolated in South Sudan, Kenya, Chad and Niger.\n\nAll giraffes are considered Vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN. In 2016, around 97,000 individuals from all subspecies were present in the wild. There are currently 5,195 northern giraffes.\n\nIn the current IUCN taxonomic scheme there is only one species of giraffe with the name \"G. camelopardalis\" and nine subspecies.\n\nThe northern giraffe has two horn-like protuberances known as ossicones on their foreheads. The northern giraffe's are longer and larger than that of the southern giraffes', though bull northern giraffes have a third cylindrical ossicone in the center of the head just above the eyes which are from 3 to 5 inches long.\n\nThe Northern giraffes live in the savannahs, shrublands and woodlands. After local extinctions in various places, the Northern giraffes are the least numerous species and the most endangered. In East Africa, they are mostly found in Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, though rarely in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. There are about 2,000 in the Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon of Central Africa. Once widespread in West Africa, a few hundreds of Northern giraffes are confined at the Dosso Reserve of Kouré, Niger. They are common in both in and outside of protected areas.\n\nThe earliest ranges of the Northern giraffes were in Chad during the late Pliocene. were once abundant in North Africa. They lived in Algeria since early Pleistocene during the Quaternary period. They lived in Morocco until their extinction around the year AD 600, as the dry climate of the Sahara made conditions impossible for the giraffes. They are also extinct in Libya and Egypt.\n\n"}

{"id": "1914545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914545", "title": "FIFA 06", "text": "FIFA 06\n\nFIFA 06, also known as FIFA Soccer 06 (North America), is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based on the game of football. It was released in the United States on 4 October 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Windows, and Nintendo DS. It was later released for PlayStation Portable, Game Boy Advance, and mobile phones.\n\nThis was the last \"FIFA\" edition to be released exclusively on six generation consoles. The taglines for the game were \"You play. They obey.\" and \"The total soccer experience.\"\n\n\"FIFA 06\" was the thirteenth game in the \"FIFA series\" and the tenth in 3D. At the time it was the highest selling game of the FIFA series, ahead of its predecessor \"FIFA 2005\" by over 100,000 copies. In total, \"FIFA 06\" has sold more than 3.6 million copies.\n\nRonaldinho and Wayne Rooney were featured on the cover of the game in the European, Australian, Brazilian and British markets. Freddy Adu and Omar Bravo joined Ronaldinho on the North American cover, while Lukas Podolski was partnered with Ronaldinho on the German edition of the game and Park Chu-Young was on the South Korea cover.\n\nClive Tyldesley and Andy Gray provide commentary for the game's English version.\n\nDevelopers of the FIFA series made a complete overhaul of the game's engine for the 2006 installment of the game, asserting it has improved the control of play, having rewritten more than half the programming code for the game. In addition to a renovation of the game engine which discards the \"ball\" system, developers boast a significantly more involved career mode and the introduction of \"chemistry\" which will determine how good teams play together. This installment broke a short tradition of commentating from John Motson and Ally McCoist, replaced by ITV's Clive Tyldesley and Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray.\n\nCareer mode in FIFA 06 is now a 15-year journey as the manager of a club of the player's choice. The user starts by filling in basic details such as their name, date of birth, and country. From here, the player gets to choose which team they would like to manage; however, only clubs with a 4-star rating or below are selectable unless the player has bought the \"Career Teams\" bundle from the in-game fan shop. In a new addition to the game players now must manage a minimum budget to build the club around. The budget can be spent on players, upgrading staff and coaches at the club and transfer budgets.\n\nPlayers must now also use their best managerial skills to negotiate a sponsor to the club. Sponsors, a new addition to career mode, provide a weekly payment to the club as well as extra bonuses through winning cups and meeting expectations of the club. If the manager does not meet these expectations, they may risk losing their sponsor at the end of the season. Some sponsors within the game are real organisations while others are simply made up.\n\nPlayers also have to manage the expectations of the board, player morale, team chemistry and keeping the club's fans happy. Ultimately, the best solution to all of these areas is to win games. Meeting the expectations of the board will almost guarantee the player a job at the club for the next season while not meeting their expectations will most likely lose the player their job and be forced to find another club. Get sacked too much and the player's career is over.\n\nPlayer morale becomes a large issue to the future of the player's club and their managerial future. Players must keep their squad happy to maintain them at the club and to keep them at their best performances. An unhappy squad can result in players refusing new contracts with the club and eventually leaving, which can be vital to the success of the club. Team chemistry is a result of the squad's morale and how often the current squad plays together. If the team is happy and are regularly playing together, team chemistry will be high. If the current squad is unhappy and hasn't played a game in seasons, team chemistry will be low therefore it is important to keep a balanced squad while maintaining success.\n\n\"FIFA 06\" also introduces staff which help the club. By upgrading the staff, this helps the club to improve depending on the area that has been upgraded. For example, if the user upgrades the negotiator to a higher level, the negotiator will be able to bring better players to the club for less money. Staff upgrades cost money which comes out of the budget.\n\nCareer mode also features a \"manager history\" section which shows your statistics as a manager for each season you play. It includes your season record, where your team finished in the ladder, and any cups the team won. Statistics for the current season are available including leading goalscorers, card recipients, team stats, league standings, and cup competition fixtures. It features three European Cup Competitions: ECC, EFA, and the European Super Cup. The ECC is the game's equivalent to the UEFA Champions League. The EFA is the equivalent to the UEFA Cup. The European Super Cup is of the same name in UEFA competition, which pits the winners of the ECC and EFA in a match right before the following season.\n\nThe \"FIFA 06 Lounge\" is a new introduction into the game. It is an upgraded form of multiplayer mode which allows up to eight human players to compete to see who is the best player over a series of matches. Each player selects a name to be identified as and a team to play as. Players can also change the rules of the game to suit their playing style. Depending on who wins and loses, players are given advantages and disadvantages to play with. Featured styles of matches in the lounge are:\n\nThe mode also includes a leaderboard featuring leading point ratings, points, wins, goals, bookings, clean sheets, offsides, longest winning streak, longest undefeated streak, and longest losing streak. League standings are featured as well as the ability to save the session so players can play at a later date.\n\nTeam management gives the player the ability to edit the game to suit themselves. The mode provides the ability to create a player and edit any player, kit number, squad, and kick takers in the game as well as the ability to transfer players to other clubs and the ability to select players for their international teams.\n\nOne of the new features in \"FIFA 06\" is a special \"retro\" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it features an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the \"FIFA 06\" developers, and a video compilation with a retrospective view at all the games in FIFA series with \"Cobrastyle\" by Teddybears STHLM featuring Mad Cobra playing as the background music.\n\nLike \"NHL 06\", and \"NBA Live 06\", the game also has a classic 16-bit game in the PS2 version - \"FIFA International Soccer\", which was the original game in the series.\n\nIn the extras section is:\n\nThe GameCube version doesn't have the tutorial videos, video previews, or season highlights.\n\n\"FIFA 06\" has introduced challenges for the player to achieve in order to win points and unlock prizes. The challenges are divided up into 10 regions of ten to twelve challenges based on the countries they can be achieved in. There are more than 100 different challenges for the player to achieve on all four difficulty levels, although a fifth difficulty can be achieved, which is legendary.\n\nWith the points earned in the challenges, prizes can be unlocked. Such unlockables in the game include classic player biographies, new camera angles, alternate club kits, stadiums, and videos.\n\nThe game also features a Classic XI team, assembled by EA Sports, consisting of great football legends, and a World XI team, consisting of current superstars, chosen by FIFPro. Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the \"Fan Shop\" with \"FIFA Points\".\n\nThe Classic XI home kit is the same one used by the Allies team in the 1981 football film \"Escape to Victory\". The away kit is also the same shirt used by the Allies team goalkeeper played by Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version of \"FIFA 06\" received a \"Double Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe game was met with positive to very mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 80.69% and 78 out of 100 for the PC version; 80.50% and 80 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 79.80% and 80 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 78.29% and 80 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 73.33% and 77 out of 100 for the PSP version; 66.22% and 75 out of 100 for the DS version; and 49.50% and 70 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version.\n\n"}

Religious mystic experiences are often described as a sudden shift from one cognitive function or another, for instance in the writings of William James. For example, William James described how one can shift from being anxious to calm by the \"phenomena of seership\" or the \"exercise of power\".\n\nCognitive shift (in the development of psychology) is also a term that relates to the understanding that thoughts (i.e. cognitions) play a key role in a person's emotional state and actions (behaviour). It was theorised by earlier behavioral psychologists that individuals were empty vessels and new experiences would be created by being repeatedly exposed and/or rewarded in relation to certain things (such as in rote learning of times tables).\n\nThe cognitive shift however, demonstrated that thoughts also play an integral process. A key experiment placed a rat in a maze and after rotating the maze the rat was able to use pointers around the room in order to find a food reward. This suggested that the rat had used internal cognition in order to influence its behavior to gain a reward. This experiment was performed by Edward C. Tolman and he explained this phenomenon as a cognitive map.\n\nAlso the fact that children, when learning a language, often and quite suddenly begin to apply rules they have learned to new phrases such as saying \"I've drinken all my drink\" after learning \"I've eaten all my food\". This is usually without being taught these rules first and as such demonstrate a key role of cognition in terms of learning. This principal is further illustrated by study conducted by Park, H. I., & Ziegler, N. (2014). Their study illustrates that overall, Cross-linguistics show a connection between language and our ability to conceptualize concepts. Linguistics influence an individual's mind from a very early age. A lot of attention has been given to the topic of bilingual cognition research due to the fact that speaking multiple languages changes the way we evaluate the perceptual attributes of our environment. One of the ways the mind of those who speak different languages differs in experience is what Pavlenko (2011) calls coexistence. By this, he means those who speak multiple languages create and maintain categories that are specific to each language and use them in accordance to the specific languages. Sachs and Coley (2006) provided evidence for co-existence through their investigation of Russian–English bilinguals’ emotional. How the concepts of Jealousy and envy are understood. The results showed that those who speak multiple languages and were tested in English understood envy and jealousy the same way English monolinguals did, while those who also speak multiple languages, but were tested in Russian categorized the understood the emotions in a way similar to Russian Monolinguals. \n\nCognitive shifts may occur after a therapist identifies an underlying fear or response mechanism and assists the client with developing remedial actions via Cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nWith the ingestion of psychedelics people often experience sudden shifts in cognitive association and emotive content. The experience can shift rapidly from negative to euphoric, and in certain cases mimic the schizophrenic condition, as researched by Humphry Osmond and others. \n\n\nKingdon, D. G., & Turkington, D.

It may be named codice_1, codice_2 or codice_3, depending on the version of Windows.\n\nThe tool is named after Doctor Watson of Sherlock Holmes fame, the idea being that it would collect error information (symptoms) following a program crash. The use of the word \"Watson\" has since been expanded to include general end-user feedback services. The original name of this diagnostic tool was \"Sherlock\".\n\nThe information obtained and logged by Dr. Watson is the information needed by technical support personnel to diagnose a program error for a computer running Windows. A text file (usually codice_4) is created whenever an error is detected, and can be delivered to support personnel by the method they prefer. A crash dump file can also be created, which is a binary file that a programmer can load into a debugger. Dr. Watson can be made to generate more exacting information for debugging purposes if the appropriate \"symbol files\" are installed and the symbol search path (environment variable) is set.\n\nWhen a program error occurs in Windows, the system searches for a program \"error handler\". A program error handler deals with errors as they arise during the running of a program. If the system does not find a program error handler, the system verifies that the program is not currently being debugged and considers the error to be unhandled. The system then processes unhandled errors by looking in the registry for a \"program error debugger\" for which Dr. Watson is the default. A third-party debugger can also be used in place of Dr. Watson. The Watcom C Compiler includes a similar crash-analysis tool named \"Dr. Watcom\".\n\nBeginning with Windows XP, Dr. Watson (drwtsn32.exe) was extended with (dwwin.exe) \"Problem Reports and Solutions\". On some versions of Windows the older version (drwatson.exe) may be available by typing \"drwatson.exe\" into the command prompt box or in the 'Search programs and files' box in the Start menu in Windows 7.\n\n\n"}

On 19 September 2013, Wilson was confirmed as a coach on \"The Voice UK\". He was the winning coach for both the fourth and fifth series of the show, being the only coach to win two years consecutively. Wilson left the show after three series, following the show's move to ITV.\n\nWilson was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire to Glynne and TV producer, Geoff Wilson. He has one brother, James.\n\nHe attended Leeds Grammar School after Ghyll Royd primary school, and later attended Leeds Metropolitan University and completed his BA (Hons) degree in Graphic Arts and Design in 2000 before undertaking his master's degree in Art and Design. He then taught at Leeds College of Art and Design for a year before the band's big break.\n\nWilson, with Nick Hodgson and Andrew White, formed the band Runston Parva. After the group failed to land a record deal, the band re-formed as Parva, with their old friends, Simon Rix and Nick Baines, joining the group, following their return from university. The band landed a record deal; they were later dropped following the closure of Mantra Recordings. They had just recently released their debut album \"22\" and their first three singles.\n\nFollowing this, the group decided to re-form for the third time, with intentions to sign a new long-term record label and release new musical material, now named Kaiser Chiefs. Their name was adapted from the South African football team Kaizer Chiefs. James Sandom became their new manager and they soon signed a recording contract with B-Unique Records.\n\nOn 19 September 2013, Wilson confirmed he would replace Danny O'Donoghue as a coach on the third series of \"The Voice UK\" alongside will.i.am, Tom \nJones, and fellow new coach Kylie Minogue, who replaced Jessie J.

He served as a major general in the Polish Army in overall command of Army Poznań during the 1939 German Invasion of Poland.\n\nTadeusz Kutrzeba was born in Kraków, a part of Austria-Hungary, since the 1795 partition of Poland. His father was a captain in the Imperial Austrian Army. In 1896, he was admitted to a military school for children in Fischau near Wiener Neustadt. He then continued his studies in the city of Hranice. Kutrzeba completed his secondary education in 1903. He graduated with distinction from the Military Technical Academy in Mödling and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, in an explosives ordnance unit. On account of his performance in school, he was given the option of choosing the location of his first posting. He chose to return to his native Kraków where he was posted from 1906 to 1910. In 1910, Kutrzeba continued his military education in Vienna, studying engineering, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1911. From 1913 to 1914, he was posted to Sarajevo, where he witnessed the immediate catalyst for the outbreak of the First World War: the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.\n\nDuring the invasion of Poland in 1939, General Kutrzeba commanded the Poznań Army, composed of four infantry divisions (14, 17, 25, 26) and two cavalry brigades (Wielkopolska and Podolska). He devised the Polish counterattack plan of the battle of Bzura and commanded the Poznań and Pomorze Armies during the battle. In the aftermath, he fought his way to Warsaw and arrived in the capital on September 22, where he briefly became the deputy commander of the Warsaw Army. At the behest of major general Juliusz Rómmel (commander of the Warsaw Army), he began capitulation negotiations with the German 8th Army. On September 28, he signed the official surrender documents.\n\nAfter the siege of Warsaw, he was captured by the Germans and spent the rest of the war in several prisoner of war camps: Hohenstein, Königstein and Oflag VII-A Murnau. General Kutrzeba remained a prisoner of war until April 1945, when Oflag VII-A Murnau was liberated by American forces. \n\nIn April 1945 he was called to London, where he was offered the position of Minister of Defense in the Government-in-Exile, which he declined. Instead, he chose to head a historical commission that focused on the Polish Army’s military campaign in September 1939 and the contributions of Polish soldiers fighting in the West from 1939 to 1945.\n\n\nGeneral Kutrzeba was given an opportunity to return to Poland. Due to poor health, however, he was unable to travel. General Kutrzeba died in London on 8 January 1947. Reportedly, the cause of his death was cancer.\n\n\n"}

She also performed at the Asia Song Festival 2005 in Busan, Korea, representing Japan.\n\nIn early 2007, Goto was chosen to be a member of Morning Musume Tanjō 10 Nen Kinentai – a unit created to celebrate Morning Musume's 10th anniversary as a group. Morning Musume Tanjō 10 Nen Kinentai also consisted of Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida, Risa Niigaki and Koharu Kusumi. Their first single, \"Bokura ga Ikiru My Asia\", was released on January 24, 2007. Goto's seventeenth single, , was released on April 11, 2007. On September 19, 2007, Goto's fourth original album \"How to Use Sexy\" was released.\n\nShortly after her brother's arrest, on October 28, 2007, during the final show of her \"G-Emotion II: How to Use Sexy\" tour, Goto suddenly announced to fans that she would be graduating from Hello! Project and leaving Up-Front Agency. Because of her graduation, she would not be able to participate in the Hello! Project 2008 Winter concert tour, previously said to be because of scheduling conflicts. In 2018, Goto revealed that Up-Front Agency had suddenly asked her to leave the company despite already booking her for work, and at the time, she felt that she was unable to say anything. She had originally planned on retiring from the entertainment industry, but reconsidered upon her mother's advice.\n\nLate in 2007, after her sudden Hello! Project graduation, rumors arose the very next day stating that Avex's CEO, Max Matsuura, had shown interest in signing Goto in for Avex. During Goto's brother trial, she disappeared from the media-eye.\n\nGoto's official blog reopened on March 25, 2008. Over the course of several entries, she revealed that she was in Los Angeles, California, taking singing and dancing lessons. On June 19, 2008, Goto had signed with the record label Rhythm Zone under Avex.\n\nMaki debuted with Avex when she participated in the company's shareholders' meeting on June 22, 2008, singing a cover of Whitney Houston's \"Saving All My Love for You.\" She also participated in A-nation'08. At A-nation, she performed the self-written song \"Hear Me\", drawing media attention for the first time since her graduation. She also sang \"Saving All My Love for You\", and a cover of Diana King's \"Shy Guy\".\n\nIn 2008, Goto became involved with The Sweet Black Project, a cross-media collaboration between J-Wave, Avex and Mixi. Goto herself chose the logo and the name, which is meant to reflect the \"positive and negative\" side of the life of today's women. On January 5, 2009, J-Wave premiered \"Sweet Black Girls\", a 15-minute segment hosted by Goto and Ryū as part of the popular radio show \"PLATOn\". The show airs from Monday to Friday and focuses on the life of women in their twenties. 30,000 messages were received during the first week alone.\n\nTo complete the project, Mixi opened a special space for Sweet Black, and Avex launched a web-documentary on YouTube based on Goto's daily routine as a singer. Promotions were met with immediate success, admittedly beyond expectations.\n\nOn January 21, 2009, Goto released her first digital single with Avex, titled \"Fly Away\". The lyrics, penned by Maki herself, are based on Mambo, a story written by Hitomi Kanehara. On February 25, Goto released her second digital single, titled Lady-Rise, also penned by herself. This time, Goto collaborated with Erika Sakurazawa, a Japanese Josei manga author.\n\nOn March 7, 2009, Goto modelled at Tokyo Girls Collection.\n\nGoto released her second mini album, \"One\", on July 28, 2010. This album and on she had begun to use her actual name rather than her \"Sweet Black\" stage name. As promotion for this release, Goto appeared on several television shows. One particular show, \"Kinyoubi no Suma tachi e\", aired a 2-hour special on her life, and included interviews with Goto as well as a performance of one of her new songs, 華詩-hanauta-, written for her mother. This episode reached 19.3% ratings for the show, making it the most watched program of the day.\n\nShe released her third EP, \"LOVE\", on May 5, 2011.\n\nOn June 22, 2011, Goto announced on her official website that she would take an indefinite hiatus from her music career beginning in 2012. She continued to make limited minor appearances at public events, such as Dream Morning Musume's concert and starred in a commercial for \"Monster Hunter\". However, in 2014, Goto relaunched her blog stating that she was not \"resuming activities right now,\" and that she will \"still [be] on hiatus.\"\n\nIn September 2018, Goto made her first television appearance in six years on the variety show \"Trio Idol na Onna\".\n\nGoto's official nickname in Hello! Project is \"Gomaki\", and she is referred to that name sometimes by the press.\n\nIn 1996, Goto's father died from a fall while mountaineering. Two years after joining Morning Musume, at the age of 15, Goto purchased a three-story house for her entire family to live in. However, she was also bullied and decided to drop out of high school.\n\nGoto has two older sisters and a young brother named Yuki Goto, the rapper of EE Jump. After Yuki was arrested on October 20, 2007 for robbery, the magazine \"Flash\" stated that Goto and one of Yuki's accomplices had been romantically involved for some time after meeting at Yūki's wedding in 2005. They have not been in contact with each other since his arrest.\n\nOn January 23, 2010, Goto witnessed her mother, Tokiko Goto, falling from the third story of their house in Edogawa, Tokyo at 11 pm. Tokiko was rushed to the hospital, but died from her injuries on January 24 at 1:13 am.\n\nGoto announced on her blog on July 22, 2014 that she had married. She gave birth to a daughter and a son on December 7, 2015, and March 27, 2017, respectively. In March 2019, Japanese weekly magazines reported Goto having an extramarital affair with her 28-year-old ex-boyfriend, who she met in 2011 and kept in contact through online games. Messages between them had suggested Goto was abused by her husband and planned to divorce him; however, she apologized for the affair on her blog and called the domestic abuse allegations \"misleading.\" Goto's husband is suing the ex-boyfriend for for damages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A tailwind increases the object's speed and reduces the time required to reach its destination, while a headwind has the opposite effect. \n\nIn aeronautics, a headwind is favorable in takeoffs and landings because an airfoil moving into a headwind is capable of generating greater lift than the same airfoil moving through tranquil air, or with a tailwind, at equal ground speed. As a result, aviators and air traffic controllers commonly choose to take off or land in the direction of a runway that will provide a headwind.\n\nIn sailing, a headwind may make forward movement difficult, and necessitate tacking into the wind.\n\nTailwinds and headwinds are commonly measured in relation to the speed of vehicles — commonly air and watercraft — as well as in running events — particularly sprints.\n\nPilots calculate the Headwind or Tailwind Component and the Crosswind Component of local wind before takeoff. The direction of wind at a runway is measured using a windsock and the speed by an anemometer, often mounted on the same post. Headwind and Tailwind are opposite interpretations of the wind component which is parallel to the direction of travel, while Crosswind represents the perpendicular component. Determining the ground speed of an aircraft requires the calculation of the head or tailwind.\n\nAssume:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nformula_4\n\nformula_5\n\nThen\n\nformula_6\n\nformula_7\n\nFor example, if the wind is at 09015 that means the wind is currently from heading 090 degrees with a speed of 15 Knots and the aircraft is taking-off from runway 24; having heading of 240. The pilot prefers the runway side with less than 90 difference from wind direction, in this case Runway 06; heading 060. Here, formula_8.\n\nformula_9\n\nformula_10\n\nThe aircraft is said to have 7.5 knots of crosswind and 13 knots of headwind on runway 06, or 13 knots of tailwind on runway 24.\n\nAircraft usually have maximum tailwind and crosswind components which they cannot exceed. If the wind is at eighty degrees or above it is said to be full-cross. If the wind exceeds 100 degrees it is common practice to takeoff and land from the opposite end of the runway, it has a heading of 060 in the above-mentioned example.\n\n"}

At this time the village had a population 347 people. In the following years many people moved out of Allmenrod and into the bigger town and cities. In most cases this was the cause of the increasing poverty.\n\nIn the First World War there was a big mobilization of soldiers in the village. The total number of casualties resulted in 13 people. Their names were written down on the memorial of the cemetery. In comparison to the bigger towns, Allmenrod was not affected as much by the dearth. This depended on the high number of farms in this village. In the early twenties Allmenrod was connected to the electricity network. In these years the village also received a central water supply.\n\nIn the Second World War 15 villagers lost their lives. On March 29 the village was taken by the 4th Armored Division of the United States.\n\nIn the year 1946 Allmenrod took in more than 100 displaced persons. These were rehoused in many households.

{"id": "1914622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914622", "title": "Emergency landing", "text": "Emergency landing\n\nAn emergency landing is a prioritised landing made by an aircraft in response to an emergency containing an imminent or ongoing threat to the safety and operation of the aircraft or involving a sudden need for a passenger or crew on board to be on land, such as a medical emergency. \n\nIt is usually a forced diversion to the nearest or most suitable airport or airbase, in which air traffic control must prioritise and give way immediately upon the declaration of the emergency.\n\nThere are several different types of emergency landings for powered aircraft: planned landing or unplanned landing. \n\n\nIf there is no engine power available during a forced landing, a fixed-wing aircraft glides, while a rotary winged aircraft (helicopter) autorotates to the ground by trading altitude for airspeed to maintain control. Pilots often practice \"simulated forced landings\", in which an engine failure is simulated and the pilot has to get the aircraft on the ground safely, by selecting a landing area and then gliding the aircraft at its best gliding speed.\n\nIf there is a suitable landing spot within the aircraft's gliding or autorotation distance, an unplanned landing will often result in no injuries or significant damage to the aircraft, since powered aircraft generally use little or no power when they are landing. Light aircraft can often land safely on fields, roads, or gravel river banks (or on the water, if they are float-equipped); but medium and heavy aircraft generally require long, prepared runway surfaces because of their heavier weight and higher landing speeds. Glider pilots routinely land away from their base and so most cross-country pilots are in current practice.\n\nSince 2003, research has been conducted on enabling UAVs to perform a forced landing autonomously.\n\nLarge airliners have multiple engines and redundant systems, so forced landings are extremely rare for them, but some notable ones have occurred. A famous example is the Gimli Glider, an Air Canada Boeing 767 that ran out of fuel and glided to a safe landing in Gimli, Manitoba, Canada on July 23, 1983. On June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Perth flew into a plume of volcanic ash and lost power in all four engines, three of which subsequently recovered, eventually diverting to Jakarta. On April 28, 1988, Aloha Airlines Flight 243 experienced an explosive decompression when approximately 35 square-meters of aluminium skin separated from the fuselage. The flight was successfully diverted to Kahului Airport with only one casualty, flight attendant Clarabelle \"C.B.\" Lansing who was sucked out when the cabin depressurized. \n\nLess than a month later, another 737, TACA Flight 110, lost both engines due to bad weather but was able to make a successful deadstick landing on a grass levee on the grounds of NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility outside New Orleans, with minor injuries to the passengers and minor damage to the aircraft. Investigations drove the engine manufacturer, CFM International, to modify the engine design to prevent future power loss.\n\nOne year later, United Airlines Flight 811, a Boeing 747, suffered a cargo door failure in-flight, separating a section of fuselage with 9 passengers and resulted in cabin depressurization. The plane made a successful emergency landing at Honolulu International Airport. More recently, Air Transat Flight 236 ran out of fuel over the Atlantic Ocean on August 24, 2001 and made a successful forced landing in the Azores. On November 1, 2011 a Boeing 767 LOT Polish Airlines Flight 016 made a belly landing after a central hydraulic system failure at Warsaw, Poland's Frederic Chopin International Airport, with no injuries.\n\nA less successful crash landing involved Southern Airways Flight 242 on April 4, 1977. The DC-9 lost both of its engines due to hail and heavy rain in a thunderstorm and, unable to glide to an airport, made a forced landing on a highway near New Hope, Georgia, United States. The plane made a hard landing and was still carrying a large amount of fuel, so it burst into flames, killing the majority of the passengers and several people on the ground.\n\nAirliners frequently make emergency landings, and almost all of them are uneventful. However, because of their inherent uncertain nature, they can quickly become crash landings or worse. Some notable instances include United Airlines Flight 232, which broke up while landing at Sioux City, Iowa, United States on July 19, 1989; and Air Canada Flight 797, which burned after landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport on June 2, 1983 after a fire started in the cabin.\n\nShannon Airport in Ireland has a high number of emergency landings from trans-Atlantic flights, as it is the first major airport after the eastbound ocean crossing.\n\nOn April 29, 2007, a bird was ingested into the right engine of a Boeing 757 departing Manchester (UK) airport, just as the plane rotated off the runway (flight Thomson 253H). The pilot subsequently made a successful precautionary landing.\n\n"}
{"id": "1914623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914623", "title": "Chesapecten", "text": "Chesapecten\n\nChesapecten is an extinct genus of scallop known from marine strata from the early Miocene to the early Pleistocene of the Eastern United States. \n\nIt flourished in the shallow seas along the Mid-Atlantic during this period. Other scallops lived at the same time, but Chesapectens were the most abundant.\n\nLike some other large scallops, the shells of \"Chesapecten\" are characterized by a pattern of wide ribs which radiate outward from the apex of the shell. A distinctive feature of \"Chesapecten\" is that the radial ribs on its shell are crossed by much smaller, rough, concentric ribs, which follow the contours of the edges of the shell (are \"conmarginal\"). The left valve of \"Chesapecten\" is more convex than the right valve. The adductor muscle scar is large and rounded.\n\nThe geographical distribution of \"Chesapecten\" is limited to the Atlantic coastal plain of North America, where it can be found as far south as Florida, and as far north as Delaware. \n\nOne species of \"Chesapecten\", \"Chesapecten jeffersonius\", is the state fossil of Virginia.\n\n\"Chesapecten\" was the first genus of North American fossil to be described and illustrated; a drawing of \"C. jeffersonius\" appeared in English naturalist Martin Lister's \"Historiae Conchyliorum, Liber III\" in 1687. However, Lister did not give \"Chesapecten\" its name. \"Chesapecten\" was formally named in 1975 by the paleontologists Ward and Blackwater. In 1980, it was assigned to the family \"Pectinidae\" by Harold E. Vokes. The name \"Chesapecten\" comes from the Chesapeake Bay, where eroding cliffs and outcrops along the beaches regularly expose specimens.\n\n\"Chesapecten\" lived on the seabed in coastal waters ranging in depth from a few feet to 130 feet. When not moving, it is assumed to have rested its flatter right valve on the seafloor. It is very likely that \"Chesapecten\" could move suddenly to escape a predator by flapping its valves and using the resulting jet propulsion, in a manner similar to that of almost all living scallops.\n\nDifferent species dominated during different intervals of time: middlesexensis during the Miocene (Eastover Formation); Chesapecten jeffersonius during Early Pliocene (Lower Yorktown Formation, about 4.5 to 4.3 million years ago); and madisonius during Late Pliocene time (Upper Yorktown Formation, about 4 to 3 million years ago).\n\nSpecies in the genus \"Chesapecten\" include:\n\nOnline photo gallery with several pictures of \"Chesapecten nefrens\"<br>\nInformation about \"Chesapecten\" from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility<br>\nImages of \"Chesapecten\" from Google Images\n"}

It was named after Herod Archelaus's Tetrarchy of Judea, but the Roman province encompassed a much larger territory. The name \"Judea\" was derived from the Kingdom of Judah of the 6th century BCE.\n\nAccording to the historian Josephus, immediately following the deposition of Herod Archelaus in 6 CE, Judea was turned into a Roman province, during which time the Roman procurator was given authority to punish by execution. The general population also began to be taxed by Rome. The province of Judea was the scene of unrest at its founding in 6 CE during the Census of Quirinius, the Crucifixion of Jesus circa 30–33 CE, and several wars, known as the Jewish–Roman wars, were fought during its existence. The Second Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE near the end of the First Jewish–Roman War, and the \"Fiscus Judaicus\" was instituted. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135), the Roman Emperor Hadrian changed the name of the province to Syria Palaestina and the name of the city of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina, which certain scholars conclude was an attempt to disconnect the Jewish people from their homeland.\n\nThe first intervention of Rome in the region dates from 63 BCE, following the end of the Third Mithridatic War, when Rome established the province of Syria. After the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus, Pompey sacked Jerusalem and installed Hasmonean prince Hyrcanus II as Ethnarch and High Priest but not as king. Some years later Julius Caesar appointed Antipater the Idumaean, also known as \"Antipas\", as the first Roman Procurator. Antipater's son Herod was designated \"King of the Jews\" by the Roman Senate in 40 BCE but he did not gain military control until 37 BCE. During his reign the last representatives of the Hasmoneans were eliminated, and the huge port of Caesarea Maritima was built.\n\nHerod died in 4 BCE, and his kingdom was divided among three of his sons, two of whom (Philip and Herod Antipas) became tetrarchs ('rulers of a quarter part'). The third son, Archelaus, became an ethnarch and ruled over half of his father's kingdom. One of these principalities was \"Judea\", corresponding to the territory of the historic Judea, plus Samaria and Idumea. \n\nArchelaus ruled Judea so badly that he was dismissed in 6 CE by the Roman emperor Augustus, after an appeal from his own population. Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee and Perea from 4 BCE was in 39 CE dismissed by Emperor Caligula. Herod's son Philip ruled the northeastern part of his father's kingdom.\n\nIn 6 CE Archelaus' tetrachy (Judea, plus Samaria and Idumea) came under direct Roman administration. The Judean province did not initially include Galilee, Gaulanitis (today's Golan), nor Peraea or the Decapolis. Its revenue was of little importance to the Roman treasury, but it controlled the land and coastal sea routes to the \"bread basket\" of Egypt and was a buffer against the Parthian Empire. The capital was at Caesarea Maritima, not Jerusalem. Quirinius became Legate (Governor) of Syria and conducted the first Roman tax census of Syria and Judea, which was opposed by the Zealots. Judea was not a senatorial province, nor an imperial province, but instead was a \"satellite of Syria\" governed by a prefect who was a knight of the Equestrian Order (as was that of Roman Egypt), not a former consul or praetor of senatorial rank. \n\nStill, Jews living in the province maintained some form of independence and could judge offenders by their own laws, including capital offenses, until \"c.\" 28 CE. The Province during the late Hellenistic period and early Roman period was divided into five conclaves, or administrative districts: Jerusalem (ירושלים), Gadara (גדרה), Amathus (עמתו), Jericho (יריחו), and Sepphoris (ציפורין).\n\nThe 'Crisis under Caligula' (37–41) has been proposed as the first open break between Rome and the Jews.\n\nBetween 41 and 44 CE, Judea regained its nominal autonomy, when Herod Agrippa was made \"King of the Jews\" by the emperor Claudius, thus in a sense restoring the Herodian dynasty, although there is no indication that Judea ceased to be a Roman province simply because it no longer had a prefect. Claudius had decided to allow, across the empire, procurators, who had been personal agents to the Emperor often serving as provincial tax and finance ministers, to be elevated to governing magistrates with full state authority to keep the peace. He may have elevated Judea's procurator to imperial governing status because the imperial legate of Syria was not sympathetic to the Judeans.\n\nFollowing Agrippa's death in 44, the province returned to direct Roman control, incorporating Agrippa's personal territories of Galilee and Peraea, under a row of procurators. Nevertheless, Agrippa's son, Agrippa II was designated \"King of the Jews\" in 48. He was the seventh and last of the Herodians.\n\nBetween the years 66-70 follows the Great Revolt.\n\nFrom 70 until 135 Judea's rebelliousness required a governing Roman legate capable of commanding legions. Because Agrippa II maintained loyalty to the Empire, the Kingdom was retained until he died, either in 93/94 or 100, when the area returned to complete, undivided Roman control.\n\nJudaea was the stage of two, possibly three, major Jewish–Roman wars:\n\nBetween 132-135 follows the Bar Kokhba revolt.\n\nUnder Diocletian (284–305) the region was divided into three provinces:\n\n"}

Of this book only fragments survived. Marcellus was accused of maintaining that the Trinity of persons in the Godhead was but a transitory dispensation. According to the surviving fragments, God was originally only one Being (\"hypostasis\"), but at the creation of the universe the Word or Logos went out from the Father and was God's Activity in the world. This Logos became incarnate in Christ and thus constituted the Image of God. The Holy Ghost likewise went forth as third Divine Person from the Father and from Christ according to John 20:22. At the consummation of all things, however (I Corinthians 15:28), Christ would return to the Father and the Godhead would be an absolute unity again.\n\nThe bishops at the First Synod of Tyre in 335 (which also deposed Athanasius) seem to have written to Constantine against Marcellus when he refused to communicate with Arius at Constantine's thirtieth-anniversary celebrations at Jerusalem. Eusebius of Caesarea wrote against him two works: \"Contra Marcellum\", possibly the prosecution document at Marcellus's trial, and \"On the Theology of the Church\" or \"Ecclesiastical Theology\", a refutation of Marcellus's theology from the perspective of Arian orthodoxy.\n\nMarcellus was deposed at Constantinople in 336 at a council under the presidency of Eusebius of Nicomedia, the Arian, and Basil of Ancyra appointed to his see. Marcellus sought redress at Rome from Pope Julius I, who wrote to the bishops who had deposed Marcellus, arguing that Marcellus was innocent of the charges brought against him. The Council of Serdica (343) formally examined his book and declared it free of heresy. But he seems not to have been reinstated in his see when Constantius II, threatened by his brother with war, allowed the restoration of Athanasius of Alexandria and Paul of Constantinople to their sees in 345. However, the synod made Marcellus's student Photinus, who later taught a variation of Marcellus's theology, bishop of Sirmium. In 344, the Synod of Antioch excommunicated Marcellus again and drew up the Macrostich, a creed which listed their beliefs and objections to Marcellus's doctrines (among others).\n\nAthanasius's relations with Marcellus were complex, and communion between them was broken off for a time, but at the end of both their lives, Athanasius resisted Basil of Caesarea's attempts to have him generally condemned, and re-established communion with Marcellus. The Second Ecumenical Council condemned 'Marcellians', but not Marcellus himself.\n\nJ. W. Hanson (1899) and other Universalist Church of America historians read that Marcellus's theology included a belief in universalism, that all people would eventually be saved. He is quoted by his opponent Eusebius as having said \"For what else do the words mean, 'until the times of the restitution' (Acts 3:21), but that the apostle designed to point out that time in which all things partake of that perfect restoration.\" (\"Against Marcellus\" 2:14) However the reference to Acts 3:21 indicates that Eusebius is probably using \"restoration\" \"apokatastasis\" here in the Jewish sense.\n\nAside from the fragments which survive in Eusebius' \"Against Marcellus\", a letter survives in Epiphanius, \"Panarion\" 72.\n\n\n\n"}

It is preceded by the establishment of mindfulness (\"sati\") and leads to energy/effort (\"viriya\") Together, mindfulness, discernment and effort calm the mind, and give way to the onset of the \"jhanas\", which are characterised by the remaining four factors of awakening, namely rapture (\"piti\"), tranquility (\"passaddhi\"), concentration (\"samadhi\") and equanimity (\"upekkha\"). According to the Samyutta Nikaya, this factor is to be developed by paying continuous careful attention (\"yoniso manasikāra bahulīkāro\") to the following states (\"dhammā\"): wholesome and unwholesome (\"kusalā-akusalā\"); blameable and blameless (\"sāvajjā-anavajjā\"); inferior and superior (\"hīna-paītā\"); and, evil and good (\"kaha-sukka\"). An alternate explanation in the nikayas is that this factor is aroused by \"discriminating that Dhamma with wisdom\" (\"taṃ dhamma paññāya pavicināti\").\n\nThe Abhidhamma's Dhammasai even more strongly associates \"dhamma vicaya\" with \"paññā\" (wisdom) in its enumeraton of wholesome states (\"kusalā dhammā\"):\nwhere \"searching the Truth\" is C.A.F. Rhys Davids' translation of \"dhammavicayo\".\n\nIn later Abhidhamma texts and in post-canonical literature (such as those by the 4th-century CE Indian scholar Vasubandhu), \"dhamma vicaya\" refers to the study of \"dhamma\" as physical or mental phenomena that constitute absolute reality (Pali: \"paramattha\"; Skt.: \"paramārtha\").\n\n\n"}

They are solitary and build nests made of mud. Nests are frequently constructed in shaded niches, often just inside of windows or vent openings, and it may take a female only a day to construct a cell requiring dozens of trips carrying mud. Females will add new cells one by one to the nest after each cell is provisioned. They provision these nests with spiders, such as crab spiders, orb-weaver spiders and jumping spiders in particular, as food for the developing larvae. Each mud cell contains one egg and is provided with several prey items. Females of some species lay a modest average of 15 eggs over their whole lifespan . Various parasites attack these nests, including several species of cuckoo wasps, primarily by sneaking into the nest while the resident mud dauber is out foraging.\n\nAs is the case with many insect genera, there are many tropical species. Some common temperate species include the black and yellow mud dauber (\"Sceliphron caementarium\") and \"Sceliphron curvatum\".\n\nLike other solitary wasps, \"Sceliphron\" species are not aggressive unless threatened. They are sometimes regarded as beneficial due to their control of spider populations, though the spiders themselves may be beneficial in controlling pest insects. Species such as \"Sceliphron curvatum\" are invasive in some parts of Europe, where they have been observed to rapidly increase their range in recent years .\n\n\nMud dauber\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1914695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914695", "title": "Rhynochetos", "text": "Rhynochetos\n\nRhynochetos is a genus of ground-dwelling birds in the Kagu family. It contains two species, both endemic to New Caledonia, one of which is extinct. \n\n\"Rhynochetos jubatus\" is the only extant species of this genus and of the family Rhynochetidae. It is closely related to tropic bird of tropical Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans with its closest living relative being the Sunbittern (\"Eurypyga helias\"). Currently there are two described species of \"Rhynochetos,\" however, it has been suggested that the extinct \"Rhynochetos orarius\" and the extant \"Rhynochetos jubatus\" are in fact the same species.\n\n\nKagus are large birds described as something \"between and small heron and a rail\". Adults are about tall with uniform ash-grey plumage with distinct orange-red bills and legs. Characteristic of these birds are long crest feathers. They weigh between , with no significant size difference between males and females.\n\nHerons can look anatomically similar but can be distinguished by the lack of bare red parts and uniform grey plumage.\n\nKagus are endemic to the small New Caledonia Island in the South Pacific, measuring 8,000 square miles. They inhabit remote, dense tropical forest regions in valleys of the southern mountainous region, as well as tall shrublands in lesser numbers. They tend to avoid shallow shrublands and savannah-grassland habitats. Typically, they require a dense canopy layer as well as a thick litter layer in which they forage for food.\n\nThe distribution of Kagus over the island is very fragmented due to a very patchy forest cover. The forests lie of ultrabasic rocks, which tend to have less extensive forest cover. On these rocks, forests are restricted to higher altitudes and along water systems. Dry season fires also contribute to decreasing forest cover and thus further fragmentation of Kagu populations.\n\nKagus have distinct sex-specific songs which they sing in the early morning. These songs can carry for distances of up to 2 km. Mating pairs will often sing duets in the early morning, which may be territorial behavior. Males tend to sing more frequently than females, and solitary songs tend to belong to males more often than females. \n\nKagu calls have been described as strange. They have various quiet hissing sounds and rattling calls. \n\nKagus forage most of the day for food in the litter layer and in low parts of trees and trunks. They are generalists, eating a wide variety of prey, from invertebrates such as earthworms, beetles and snails to lizards and small fish. Their food supply is influenced by seasonality, eating larger prey when there is more food availability, such as in wetter seasons. In drier seasons, Kagus will eat smaller prey such as larvae. In wetter seasons, when food is more available, they will spend less of the day foraging and carry out other activities, such as preening.\n\nKagu pairs nest in large permanent territories. Outside of breeding the male and the female will live separately within their shared territory. There is no well-defined breeding season, however, pairs tend to have more breeding attempts during wetter periods. Some young may remain in their parent's territory for several years, even helping in rearing younger siblings.\n\nKagus raise on average about 1 hatchling yearly. The amount of breeding attempts of Kagus are very variable, with any from 0-7 breeding attempts per year possible until a successful breeding attempt takes place. They will lay and incubate a single egg for about 5 weeks. At 3 days old, the parents will feed the chick during the day and brood at night. This will occur for 2 months, at the end of which the fledgling will be two thirds of its adult body size. The fledgling will typically be fed until it reaches 3.5 to 4 months of age. Kagus have long lifespans, with many living 20 to 30 years in captivity.\n\nPrior to the discovery of the Island by Captain James Cook in 1774, there was a healthy population of both species of \"Rhynochetos\". Following the discovery of the island, various human activities threatened the stability of Kagu populations. The Kagus began being trapped heavily, both for its meat and for its export. The beautiful display of the male led to its export around the world to zoos and museums. Introduced domestic animals, such as cats and dogs are a major threat to the Kagus. They roam free around the island and eat adults, juveniles and eggs. Other human activity, such as logging and hunting has further fragmented their habitat. These birds tend to avoid human settlements; areas with increased human activity tend to have lower numbers. Maintenance of genetic diversity of the Kagus is therefore threatened as further fragmentation is further isolating patches and may decrease migration between the patches. \n\nOiseaux\n\nBird Life International\n\nHandbook of the Birds of the World\n\nAvibase\n\nIUCN Red List\n"}

He was part of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group and the first post-colonial generation of artists in India, like John Wilkins who also broke free from the nationalist Bengal school and embraced Modernism instead, with its post-impressionist colours, cubist forms and brusque, expressionistic styles.\n\nAmong his most noted later paintings were his triptych \"Celebration\", which when sold for Rs 15 million ($317,500) at a Christie's auction in 2002, was not only the highest sum for an Indian painting at an international auction, but also triggered the subsequent great Indian art boom; his other noted works were the 'Diagonal Series', \"Santiniketan triptych\" series, \"Kali\", \"Mahishasura\" (1996). He stayed and worked in Mumbai for much of his life, except for three spells at London, New York, and Santiniketan, each having a distinct impact upon his work. He received several awards during his career including the Padma Bhushan in 2007.\n\nTyeb Mehta was born on 26 July 1925 in Kapadvanj, a town of Kheda district, the Indian state of Gujarat. He was brought up in the Crawford Market neighbourhood of Mumbai, populated by Dawoodi Bohras. At 22 years, during the partition riots of 1947 in Mumbai, while staying at Lehri House, Mohammed Ali Road, he witnessed a man being stoned to death by a mob, this he not only expressed in a drawing but it was to have lasting impact on his work, leading to stark and often disturbing depiction of his subjects.\n\nFor a while initially, he worked as a film editor in a cinema laboratory at Famous Studios, in Tardeo, Mumbai. Later, he received his diploma from Sir J. J. School of Art in 1952, and was part of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group, which drew stylistic inspiration from Western Modernism, and included greats of Indian paintings such as F.N. Souza, S.H. Raza and M.F. Husain.\n\nHe left for London in 1959, where he worked and lived till 1964. Thereafter, he visited the New York City, when he was awarded a fellowship from the John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund in 1968. During the years the artist spent in London, Mehta's style was influenced by the expressionist works of Francis Bacon, but while in New York his work came to be characterised by minimalism. He made a three-minute film, \"Koodal\" (Tamil for 'meeting place'), which he shot at the Bandra slaughter house, it won the Filmfare Critics Award in 1970. He also remained an Artist-in-Residence at the Santiniketan between 1984–85, and returned to Mumbai with significant changes in his work. Common themes of his works were trussed bulls, the rickshaw puller, from here he moved to the \"Diagonal series\", which he created through the 1970s, after accidentally discovering it in 1969, when in a moment of creative frustration he flung a black streak across his canvas. Later in life, he added \"Falling Figures\" made in 1991, based on his experience of witnessing the violent death of a man in the street during the Partition of India riots of 1947, Besides adding several mythological figures into his work, highlighted by the depictions of goddess Kali and demon Mahishasura.\n\nTyeb Mehta held the then record for the highest price an Indian painting has ever sold for at auction ($317,500 USD or 15 million Indian rupees) for \"Celebration\" at Christie's in 2002. In May 2005, his painting \"Kali\" sold for 10 million Indian rupees (approximately equal to 230,000 US dollars) at Indian auction house Saffronart's online auction. A reinterpretation of the tale of demon Mahishasura by Mehta showing goddess Durga locked in an embrace with the demon sold for $1.584 million. In 2008 one of his paintings sold for $2 million.\n\nIn December 2005, Mehta's painting \"Gesture\" was sold for 31 million Indian rupees to Ranjit Malkani, chairman of Kuomi Travel, at the Osian's auction. That made it the highest price ever paid by an Indian for a work of Indian contemporary art at auction in India at the time.\n\nMehta's were the first works by a contemporary Indian artist to sell for over a million dollars, and indicated a burgeoning interest in Indian art by the international market; as a result, Mehta became a cultural hero.\n\nTyeb Mehta spent most of life in Mumbai and later in life stayed at Lokhandwala, Mumbai. He died on 2 July 2009 at a Mumbai hospital following a heart attack. He is survived by his wife, Sakina, their son, Yusuf, and daughter, Himani and a number of grandchildren.\n\nHe received a fellowship from the John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund in 1968, also in the same year, a gold medal for paintings at the first Triennial in New Delhi, and in 1974 the Prix Nationale at the International Festival of Painting in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France, the Kalidas Samman, instituted by the Madhya Pradesh Government, in 1988, the Dayawati Modi Foundation Award for Art, Culture, and Education in 2005, and the Padma Bhushan in 2007. His film 'Koodal' was awarded the Filmfare Critics' Award in 1970.\n\nMehta's work has been exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, England, and the Hirshhorn Museum. A career retrospective is scheduled for later 2009 at the National Gallery of Modern Art, in New Delhi.\n\n\n\n"}

It was located in both the Northern Transvaal, now Limpopo province and Eastern Transvaal, now Mpumalanga province. It must not be confused with the Gaza kingdom which once existed in Mozambique.\n\nGazankulu received self-rule from the central government in 1969, with its capital at Giyani. Gazankulu homeland officially starts at Elim Hospital, near Makhado, from Elim it then heads east towards the Levubu river valley, the villages of Valdezia and Bungeni being the two largest Tsonga settlements in the Levubu river valley, with a combined population of more than 50 000 people, according to the mid-2015 population statistics and stretched down up to the banks of the Sabie River near Skukuza in Hazyview in Mpumalanga. Total length of Gazankulu, from Elim Hospital to Hazyview, was 317 km long, which is a distance equivalent of travelling from Pretoria to Bandelierkop in Limpopo. The homeland consisted of the 'Mainland Gazankulu' which were Elim, Giyani and Malamulele, with 3 large exclaves, which were Bushbuckridge, Tzaneen and Phalaborwa.\n\nBefore the 1913 Land Act, Bushbuckridge, Phalaborwa and Tzaneen were not Tsonga exclaves, they were physically connected with other Tsongas of Elim, Giyani and Malamulele. The 1913 Land Act resulted in 3 large Tsonga exclaves, during the 1960s, Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi fought unsuccessfully against the central government's unilateral land demarcations, which unfortunately resulted in 3 large Tsonga exclaves. Despite Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi's protests at unilateral land demarcations, the central government went ahead to create 3 large Tsonga exclaves, which the Tsonga people opposed unconditionally throughout the 1960s, 1970's and 1980's. Gazankulu shared borders with other black homelands, which were, Venda, Lebowa and Kangwane. These 3 other black homelands, like Gazankulu, also experienced land grabs and unfair land allocations from the central government.\n\nGazankulu had 10 formal townships, which were all created and build by the Apartheid Government from the late 1960s until the late 1980s, they are; Waterval in Elim, Giyani in Giyani, Malamulele in Malamulele, Nkowankowa in Tzaneen, Lulekani in Phalaborwa, Acornhoek in Bushbuckridge, Thulamahashe in Bushbuckridge, Dwarsloop in Bushbuckridge and Mkhuhlu in Hazyview. The above townships were curved out of land owned by local Traditional leaders or tribal chiefs. In Waterval, the land traditionally belong to of the Mukhari-Xilumani clan, in Giyani, the land belong to Hosi Risinga of the Chabalala clan, in Nkowankowa, the land belong to Hosi Muhlava II of the Nkuna clan, in Lulekani, the land belong to Hosi Majeje(M.Ntsan'wisi) of the Maluleke clan, in Thulamahashe, the land belong to Hosi Nxumalo of the Ndwandwe-Zwide clan and in Mkhuhlu, the land belong to Hosi Hoxani of the Nkuna Clan.\n\nGazankulu had 9 district hospitals, which are; Elim Hospital in Elim, Nkhensani Hospital in Giyani, eVuxakeni Psychiatrist Hospital in Giyani, Malamulele Hospital in Malamulele, Letaba Hospital in Tzaneen, Shiluvane hospital in Tzaneen, Tintswalo Hospital in Bushbuckridge, Masana hospital in Bushbuckridge and Matikwana Hospital in Hazyview. In addition, these district hospitals are attached to more than 150 Community Health Centres and clinics. Masana Hospital was later, in 1976, given to Mapulana people, a close neighbour of Tsonga people in Bushbuckridge and is known today as Mapulaneng Hospital. Elim Hospital in Waterval, Masana Hospital in Bushbuckridge and Shiluvane Hospital in Tzaneen were Swiss Mission Hospitals, having established by the Swiss Missionaries who brought Gospel to the Tsonga people.\n\nGazankulu had 16 modern shopping centres, which are; Bindzulani in Nkowankowa; Elim Mall in Elim, Hubyeni Shopping Centre in Elim, Giyani Regional Mall, Masingita shopping complex (Giyani), Masingita Mall (Giyani), Masingata Plaza (Giyani), Malamulele Crossing (Malamulele), Mangalani Shopping complex (Malamulele), Acornhoek Plaza (Bushbuckridge), Acornhoek Mall (Bushbuckridge), Thulamahashe Plaza (Bushbuckridge), Thula Mall in Thulamahashe (Bushbuckridge), Dwaarsloop Mall (Bushbuckridge) and Mkhuhlu Plaza (Hazyview).\n\nThere were two major Industrial Zones in Gazankulu, which were Letaba in Tzaneen and Mkhuhlu in Hazyview. All Investments in the Homeland of Gazankulu were concentrated in these two towns, which were also Industrial Zones in the old Transvaal Province.\n\nThe land of the Tsonga people proper starts from Elim Hospital near Makhado / Louis Trichardt and ends in Skukuza near Hazyview in Mpumalanga Province. From the year 1899 until the 1960s, the land was cut off into small pieces by the Colonial Government until the Tsonga land was reduced to four territories. The cutting off of Tsonga land was in line with the 1913 Land Act, where 13% of South African land was allocated to Homelands.\n\nUnder the leadership of Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi, Gazankulu has successfully resisted forced removal of Tsonga people in the following areas during the 1960s, Elim Shirley community, the central government has already finalised the plan to forcibly remove the Tsonga from Elim Shirley farms and to dump them at an arid place in around Malamulele. Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully challenged the government of the day against the forced removal of the Elim Shirley community, to this day, the Tsonga people at Elim Shirley still enjoy their land rights. Elim Hospital, which was also scheduled to be removed into a village in Malamulele, is today a living Tsonga monument within the Elim Shirley community.\n\nValdezia community, the only remaining Tsonga community in the heart of the Levubu river, was also threatened with forced removal during the 1960s, the central government has already finalised the removal of the entire community to an unknown location. With regards to Valdezia, Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi has issued a warning and declaration of war against the central government, he told Pretoria during the 1970s that \"there will be bloodshed if the central government goes ahead and forcibly remove the people of Valdezia\", the threat to forcibly remove the people of Valdezia went on until 1984 when the South African government announced that \"Valdezia will no longer be removed as originally planned by the central government, rather it will be retained as a detached area of Gazankulu\". For more than 18-years, Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully resisted the forced removal of the people of Valdezia, to this day, the community of Valdezia still enjoy their land rights, which wouldn't be possible today should the central government had gone ahead with forced removal.\n\nRibolla community of Mbhokota, Chavani, Bokisi, Riverplaats and some parts of Nwaxinyamani. As the name suggests, these communities are found on the western, southern and eastern parts of Mount Ribola, a prominent landmark mountain around Elim. Forced removals were a reality in this part of Gazankulu. These lands were collectively known as the \"Tsonga finger\" by the apartheid government and the Tsonga people were to be removed in their great numbers, this is a proud home of the Tsonga people in the Elim area.\nProfessor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully claimed back the \"Tsonga finger\"after the central government failed to forcibly removed the tsonga people. After a successfully land claims by Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi, the land became known as the \"Tsonga finger\" because on the South African map, it looks like a finger.\n\nHowever, after the central government's failure to remove all the Tsonga people from the \"Tsonga finger\", they did manage to remove one Tsonga chief from his land, Hosi Bokisi in 1968. In 2016, a descendant of the late chief Bokisi managed to get back all his grandfather's land that was taken, the old Bokisi has been claimed back and chief Bokisi has demarcated residential stands, next to chavani village, alongside the Elim road.\n\nBungeni community, the largest Tsonga settlement in the Levubu river valley and the most populous Tsonga settlement in the whole Elim area, was, alongside its neighbour, Valdezia community, to be removed from the entire area completely and relocated into unknown location. Professor H.W.E Ntsanwisi successfully claimed back the entire Bungeni community against the central government's intention to forcibly remove them from the entire Levubu valley. To this day, the Bungeni community still enjoy their land rights, a right that wouldn't have been possible if they were removed. The Bungeni community is still waiting for the transfer of the eastern part of Nwaxinyamani village back into its tribal authority, the piece of land was stolen during the 1960s when demarcation was done between Nkhensani tribal authority (people of Chavani village) and Bungeni tribal authority (people of Bungeni). The piece of land that must transferred back to Bungeni is known as Skhosana village, which is today part of nwaxinyamani, during the 1960s, that land belonged to Hosi Makhoma Skhunyani, and if everything goes according to plan, Bungeni new stands, under Hosi Makhoma Skhunyani, will be joined with Skhosana village and form part of Hosi Makhoma's land.\n\nHosi Mtsetweni\n\nDuring the 1960s, many Vatsonga chiefs lost their status as senior chiefs and have their lands greatly reduced when homelands were created and political boundaries demarcated. One of the most important chief in the Elim area to have his land and chieftainship taken away was Hosi Mtsetweni, a fully fledged senior chief with a vast land. After he was de-recognized by the government, he was given to Hosi Bungeni as his headman, his land greatly reduced into a very small village called ka-Mtsetweni 3 km south of Levubu Agricultural plantation. Before he was de-recognized by the government in 1960, he had the same status as Hosi Bungeni, also in terms of land mass. After the 1994 democratic elections, the new government is still trying to solve this problem through its Katla commission.\n\nHosi Bokisi\n\nAnother important chief in the Elim area had his chieftainship interfered with, his land was reduced into a small village on a mountain slope just east of Elim. He was given to Hosi Chavani as his headman. Hosi Bokisi, just like Hosi Mtsetweni, is a fully fledged senior chief of the Bokisi community but was reduced to a status of a headman, his land greatly reduced to few hundred hectares\n\nThis is a paramount chief of all Vatsonga in the whole Makhado area, his jurisdiction covers almost all areas where Tsonga people live in the Makhado area. However, his paramountancy as chief of all Vatsonga in the Makhado area was highly contested by João Albasini, who declared himself chief of all Vatsonga people in the Makhado area. The paramount chieftainship was lost in 1930 upon the death of at waterval Shirley farm, after the death of the great , the whole village of Elim was run and managed by the Swiss Mission Church, known today as Evangelical Presbyterian Church in South Africa (EPCSA). The Swiss missionaries at Elim were responsible for the disappearance of paramount chieftainship since they are the ones that decided that Elim, as a 'Capital' site of the Swiss Mission Church in South Africa, should be run and managed by the Church, as a result, no new chief of the clan was appointed after 1930. The Swiss Mission Church in South Africa was later, during the 1960s, to play a positive role and to the benefit of the chieftainship since they actively opposed the forced removal of the Elim Shirley Community. Between 1930 up until 1995, the chieftainship disappeared from the scene, it was only restored in 1995 by President Nelson Mandela. However, the status of as a paramount chief was not restored, he was only recognised as a senior chief.\n\nHowever, during the 1960s, the apartheid government gave some form of recognition to the chieftainship, the incumbent was given a status of an independent headman without a chief, but a tribal office was not granted until 1995. The land of was greatly reduced in size, only the villages of Elim, Lemana, Shirley, Waterval, Magangeni, eka-Mabobo and were left for him to exercise his authority.\n\nHosi Malele\n\nThe fate that befell hosi Malele and his Wayeni community during the 1960s was rather regrettable. His land was reduced into a small village and his seniority taken away, he was given to Hosi Bungeni as his headman. Malele' land was big and he occupied the rolling hills southeast of Elim known to the apartheid government as \"Bellevue\". Hosi Malele was an independent senior chief with a big land like hosi Bokisi. Today, he is trying to reassert his autonomy by refusing to participate in the Bungeni tribal authority since originally he never reported nor fell under Hosi Bungeni.\n\nHosi Mahatlani Sibisi\n\nJust like hosi Malele of Wayeni, hosi Mahatlani's land became a dumping ground for all communities that were removed from their land by the apartheid government and dumped on his land. The village of Ribungwani and Masakona have taken land that previously fell under hosi Mahatlani's jurisdiction. In 1960, hosi Mahatlani was de-recognised by the apartheid government and handed over to Hosi Bungeni as his Induna. Today, hosi Mahatlani is considered a rebel at Bungeni village because he is refusing to participate in the Bungeni tribal authority as an induna. Just like hosi Mtsetweni, his chieftainship is currently being investigated by the kgatla commission.\n\nHosi Skhunyani\n\nThe land on the beautiful hill east of Nwanancila river known today as Skhosana village (under headman Nwaxinyamani) up until the eastern side of Rivolwa mountain and the village of Bodwe is the land of Headman Skhunyani and his people. They were expelled in 1960 and dumped at a village known today as Bungeni new stands. Headman Skhunyani, along with headman Nwaxinyamani, are the original headmen of Hosi Bungeni and fell under the jurisdiction of Hosi Bungeni from the time they took up the land some centuries ago. Consequently, Skhunyani, known today as Skhosana, is the original land of Hosi Bungeni\n\nGazankulu, as a political entity, no longer exists, it is today part of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. In 1994, Gazankulu was sub-divided into different municipalities cross-cutting linguistic and cultural boundaries, a feature of a new democratic South Africa. The western district of former Hlanganani was allocated to Makhado Local Municipality (130 000 people), the southern part of Hlanganani was divided and allocated to Greater Letaba Local Municipality (45 000 people), while the eastern part of Hlanganani was allocated to Greater Giyani Local Municipality (35 000 people). In total, Hlanganani district lost 80 000 people to both the Greater Giyani and Greater Letaba local Municipalities in 1994, while Makhado local municipality was the biggest beneficiary of the former Hlanganani district, it took more than 130 000 people from the former Hlanganani in 1994 when the district was broken-up. The Greater Giyani Local Municipality was merged with some parts of Bolobedu (Northern Sotho speaking), Malamulele was merged with Thulamela Local Municipality and Lulekani was merged with Namakgale to form a new Municipality with Phalaborwa known as Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. Shiluvane, under Hosi Muhlaba and other Tsonga areas in Ritavi has been merged to form Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality. In Bushbuckridge, the whole area has been merged with Northern Sotho and the Swazi to form Bushbuckridge Local Municipality. \n\nThe population of the former Gazankulu, according to the 2011 census, is spread out as follows; Limpopo 1.1 million or 17% of the province, Mpumalanga 500 000 or 11.5% of the province and Gauteng 800 000 or 4% of the province. Total population is 2,3 million or 5% of South Africa's population. All the Tsonga people working and schooling in Gauteng comes from Gazankulu, so the 800 000 Tsonga people in Gauteng have their homes in Gazankulu, it can, therefore, be assumed that when these Tsonga people return to Limpopo and Mpumalanga during Easter and December holidays, the Tsonga population in both Limpopo and Mpumalanga rises sharply.\n\nDistricts of the homeland and population in the 1991 census. \n\n"}

At the end of the 19th century, it became an important railway hub. Facilities were built to process a large part of agricultural products coming from the areas of the upper Don and Ukraine to send to the central provinces of Russia. It was granted town status in 1926.\n\nDuring World War II, in July 1942, an encirclement of Soviet troops by German forces occurred around the town, resulting in the Soviet troops being captured.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Millerovo serves as the administrative center of Millerovsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Millerovsky District as Millerovskoye Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Millerovsky Municipal District.\n\nThe basis of the town's economy is food grain.\n\nThe Millerovo military airfield is located northwest of the town.

The barrage is opened during a rising high tide to allow the sea water in, then shut as the tide turns. The water stored above the barrage is then forced through an artificial channel to provide water features.\n\nThe nature of artificial whitewater courses necessitates the need for a drop in the river, and enough water flow to provide hydraulics. When this isn't possible (often in flat low-lying areas), electric pumps are used to lift and re-circulate the water to the top of the course. The shapes of these courses are commonly circular or U-shaped.\n\nPumped courses are extremely expensive to run, typically 1-2 megawatts of electrical power are needed to pump 15 cubic metres per second of water down a course with a 5-meter drop in height.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1914717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914717", "title": "Tanglin Trust School", "text": "Tanglin Trust School\n\nTanglin Trust School (TTS) is an international school in Singapore run as a non-profit organisation. Established in 1925, Tanglin Trust School provides British-based learning with an international perspective for students aged 3–18. There are approximately 2,720 students at Tanglin, with 740 in the Infant School, 770 in the Junior School and 1190 in the Senior School and Sixth Form. Each school has its own building and facilities within the one campus. Approximately 60–70% of students in the school are British passport holders, although this is not an admissions requirement. As at May 2014, 54 nationalities are represented. Very few Singaporean students attend the school as the Singapore government's regulations prevent most of its citizens from attending international schools, hence only 4% of the student body of international schools in Singapore are Singaporean.\n\nIn its last four inspections in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, Tanglin Trust School was awarded Outstanding, the highest possible grade under the Ofsted-recognised British Schools Overseas framework.\n\nThe two admissions criteria to enter the school are that a student must have a level of English sufficient to access the curriculum and the school has the capacity to support a students' learning support needs. Waiting lists exist for some year groups. Children of staff and prospective students who have siblings already attending the school are some of those given priority on the waiting lists. A Placement Rights scheme exists to facilitate accelerated entrance into the school. Students may be asked to submit a sample of work, attend an interview or complete an exam depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe English National Curriculum provides the basis for the programmes of study which are enriched to reflect the calibre of students and the school's international setting. Infant School students are aged between 3 and 7 and the curriculum they follow is the Early Years Foundation Stage in Nursery and Reception followed by Key Stage 1 in Years 1 and 2. Students in the Junior School, aged between 7 and 11, follow Key Stage 2 in Years 3 to 6. Students in the Senior School, including those in the Sixth Form, are aged 11 to 18 years. They study Key Stages 3 in Years 7 to 9; Key Stage 4 in Years 10 and 11; and Key Stage 5 in Years 12 and 13. As students progress through Key Stage 3 to 5 of the English National Curriculum, they are presented with a widening choice of subjects to choose from for their General Certificate of Secondary Education (I/GCSE) and A Level or IB examinations.\n\nThe school achieves impressive International Baccalaureate, A-Level and GCSE results enabling graduates to enter their universities of choice in the UK as well as other leading institutions around the world.\n\nAt Tanglin there is a strong belief in the value of learning outside the classroom. The development of the child as a whole is paramount and it is recognised that different students are motivated by different experiences. Hence students can take part in a wide array of co-curricular activities and challenging residential field studies to enrich their learning experience. In addition to year group outdoor education programmes to destinations right across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, there is also a range of curriculum-based and optional discovery programmes including skiing in Switzerland, an adventure week in Western Australia, studying art in Bali, brushing up language skills in Barcelona and even a chance to climb to Everest Base Camp. The school also offers the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Scheme, operating under the Singapore designation of The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA).\n\nSport is an integral part of the Tanglin curriculum. Athletics, basketball, swimming, football, rugby, netball, tennis, gymnastics, badminton, cricket, golf, tee-ball, softball and volleyball are all established activities that have well-developed training programmes in place and offer participants the opportunity to compete in inter-school events, both in Singapore as well as overseas. Sports facilities at the school include: air-conditioned sports halls within each of the schools; an eight-lane 25-metre swimming pool and learner pool; tennis courts; playing fields; running track; athletics facilities and a fitness centre.\n\nTanglin has a sustained commitment to The Athletics Conference Singapore International Schools (ACSIS) sporting structure which underpins the school's continued involvement in local sports. This is further supported through participation in overseas sport at regular tournaments and competitions through the South East Asia Student Activity Conference (SEASAC) and the Federation of British Schools in Asia (FOBISIA), as well as sporting tours to destinations around Asia, the Middle East and Australia.\n\nMoreover, the school embraces the performing arts, with well-established choirs, orchestras, dance show cases and concerts. The performing arts facilities include several performance halls, fully equipped drama and dance studios, a film studio and a state-of-the-art music department which includes practice rooms, a music IT suite supported by iMacs and electronic keyboards, a main rehearsal space for larger groups and a professional recording and performance studio. Tanglin also participates in regional events involving the Arts such as the International Schools Theatre Association (ISTA) events.\n\nTTS Foundation Limited (TTS Foundation) was established in May 2012 and was registered as a charity in June 2013. It was set up as a fundraising entity and is managed by the Development Office at Tanglin. TTS Foundation currently has start-up funding which does not come from school fee income. It was established to support enrichment activities and projects beyond the regular curriculum and to enhance the educational experiences of students at Tanglin Trust School. It does this by administering the Our World Fund which support projects that benefit the school community. These range in nature and size and include a scholarship and awards programme as well as Our World projects. Each project has to qualify individually for funding and must adhere to Tanglin Trust School's mission statement\n\nThe school was founded in 1925 by Anne Griffith-Jones. It is the second oldest International School in Singapore after the Japanese School. When it opened, it operated from premises within the Tanglin Club. It began with five students, but soon began to grow rapidly. At the time, many British expatriates living in Singapore sent their children away to boarding school in Britain at an early age. The school offered the alternative of providing British-style education in Singapore, so parents could postpone boarding school until an older age.\n\nIn 1934, Griffith-Jones opened a second school – the Tanglin Boarding School in the Cameron Highlands (now part of Malaysia). Again this was intended as a nearby alternative for expatriate families living in the region who would otherwise have to send their children to boarding schools in Britain. Many children who attended the school in Singapore up to the age of eight then went on to the boarding school in the Cameron Highlands, which catered for students up to the age of 13. However the school in Singapore continued to flourish.\n\nThe Japanese occupation of the Malay Peninsula in 1942 forced the closure of both schools, as British expatriates in the region (including Griffith-Jones) were interned by the Japanese. The schools reopened after the war. From 1948, the unsafe conditions created by Malayan Emergency meant the school in the Cameron Highlands had to be put under full-time armed guard and children were transported to and from school in armoured vehicles at the end and start of term. The Cameron Highlands School was eventually forced to close by the Federal Government for security reasons in 1950 and the school was sold to the British War Office.\n\nIn 1958, Griffith-Jones retired and sold the private company Tanglin School Ltd to the British European Association (now known as the British Association of Singapore) in Singapore. In 1961, governance of the school was handed over to a non-profit education Trust known as the Tanglin Trust Ltd.\n\nIn 1971, the Trust opened a second British international primary school in Singapore called Weyhill Preparatory School. Three years later the Trust also took over the running of another international school in Singapore called Raeburn Park School, which had been opened in 1954 by the Singapore Harbour Board for the children of its expatriate staff. In 1981, the three schools were merged into one at its present campus on Portsdown Road. Initially, the campus housed two largely separate-functioning infant and junior schools known as Tanglin Infant School and Tanglin Junior School. A separate nursery school (known as Winchester Nursery School) also operated at Alexandra Park for twenty years between 1976 and 1996, but this was moved to the new purpose-built Infant School on the Portsdown Road campus in 1996. In the late-1980s, the administration and curriculum of the schools was centralised under a single Head Teacher and in 1996 the name Tanglin Trust School was adopted.\n\nThe school has an alumni community which is designed to help current and former students stay in touch with each other and with Tanglin. Alumni from schools pre-dating Tanglin Trust School: Tanglin School, Tanglin Preparatory School (TPS), Weyhill Preparatory School (WPS), Raeburn Park School (RPS) and Winchester Nursery are encouraged to reconnect through the Tanglin Alumni community. Additionally there is a Friends of Tanglin network which is open to all current and former teachers, support staff, Governors and parents.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1914718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914718", "title": "Hammerstein (comics)", "text": "Hammerstein (comics)\n\nHammerstein is a fictional robot created by Pat Mills and Kevin O'Neill, who first appeared in 1978 as a member of Ro-Busters in the British comic \"Starlord\" but is best known as the leader of the ABC Warriors in \"2000AD\".\n\nHammerstein is described as a Mark III war droid and was commissioned in the early 21st Century to fight in the Volgan Wars. Hammerstein's right hand is a hammer that is used in hand-to-hand combat while on the back of his left he has a missile launcher. There are tank tracks on his feet to aid mobility. Hammerstein also has two sockets in his waist to attach auxiliary arms but he finds these embarrassing. During combat operations his head has a grim human like face but after he was decommissioned this was replaced with 'civilian' head that features a single square 'eye'.\n\nYears after the Volgan occupation of Western Europe, the United States began a counter-invasion to, officially, liberate the area; unofficially, Earth's oil reserves were running low and they wanted to seize the Volgan's oil reserves. To do this they created expendable robot soldiers - ABC Warriors - designed to wage war across any terrain in any kind of combat, atomic, bacterial or chemical. The first of their number were called Hammersteins. Developed by Howard Quartz's Ro-Busters corporation, they first saw use at Fishguard in 2009, leading the Allied liberation of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first two models were failures. The Mk I robot was an effective killer but could not distinguish between targets on their own, killing civilians as well as Volgan soldiers. When controlled remotely by human soldiers in 2009, the Volgans were able to seize control and redirect them against American forces, driving them back across Wales and causing the American public to protest the use of war-robots. Thousands of Hammersteins were destroyed for fear of Volgan reprogramming. The later Mk II was given an artificial intelligence, with different stories giving different reasons why they failed. In the original \"Ro-Busters\" story, that meant Mk II platoons surrendered to the Volgans instead of fighting; in the later \"ABC Warriors\", the MK II's were said to be given \"genuine moral values\" and had become pacifists, and were killed for trying to convert human soldiers; and in \"Savage\", the MK II's ethical values included the price of collateral damage and they surrendered rather than damage the property values of Virginia Water (a deliberate set-up by the US so the British insurgency groups would be culled).\n\nThe Mk III Hammerstein was given artificial values and emotions such as patriotism, believing the enemy is always evil, and that war is necessary to protect national interests - just enough to stop him slaughtering civilians but not question why he was fighting. Initially, his master program could not accept the secondary programs because of their logical contradictions. His programmer and a 'robopsychologist' tried to get them in sync by forcing him to feel emotions; the first genuine he felt was jealousy that they were a couple, and he murdered them without understanding why.\n\nThe first Mk III Hammerstein would be the template for those that followed. He was field-tested by having him serve with a human regiment; he faced and overcame robophobia from his comrades and came to be a trusted soldier under Sergeant \"Country\" Farmer's command. The human generals were pleased by this and began to withdraw human soldiers & mass-produce robot ones.\n\nHammerstein was promoted to sergeant and began to lead the new war robots; as a result he was one of the few whose movements weren't remotely controlled by human generals. Despite his programming, he showed a paternal interest in the other Hammerstein units under his command and at one point disobeyed orders to save them from Volgan Stalins. He also became disillusioned due to the constant horrors of war and robots being used as cannon fodder by the humans. He once removed the pain barrier - which allowed humans to remotely experience a Warrior's actions but not its pain - from a dying comrade to put him out of its misery; this killed the officer in the process, but nothing was ever proved.\n\nHe was the first ABC Warrior recruited by the mysterious Colonel Lash to work as Martian peacekeepers near the end of the war, and gathered the other recruits. His distrust of humans increased when he was ordered to recruit the Volgan butcher Blackblood and when he discovered that his fellow ABC Warriors were being slaughtered by the humans following victory. Nevertheless, Hammerstein and Colonel Lash took the newly formed team to Mars to tame the devil planet and finally bring peace to its red plains.\n\nFollowing their success, the Warriors returned to Earth and separated. Hammerstein ended up with a new head and a different personality to go with it. He was eventually sold as army surplus to the much feared Ro-Busters Disaster Ltd, which saw him serving alongside the sewer robot Ro-Jaws. After helping to save countless human lives (and once going on a rampage in London after his programming reverted to the war years), Hammerstein and Ro-Jaws thwarted a plot by Ro-Buster's owner to kill all the robots for insurance money. He helped mount a mass robot escape to Saturn Six, a moon taken over by robots years before; he felt he could be made a general on this free world and viewed this as meaning he would not associate with Ro-Jaws anymore. He threw this dream away in order to cover the robots escape, fighting alongside Ro-Jaws and ten other brave robots - entering Saturn Six legend as The Hero Dozen - to cover the other robot's escape. The two of them then walked off with new identity papers singing as they went, admitting that despite their wildly different personality clashes they were still mates and would be stuck walking \"side by side\".\n\nAs the centuries passed, Hammerstein realised war was all he knew, and decided to re-join the army. With a number of other ABC War robots, he was brought into service by Torquemada's Terminator armies during the invasion of the Gothic Empire. After being caught showing mercy to alien civilians, he and two comrades Mad Ronn and Hitaki - were reprogrammed and sent on a suicide mission. The mission was thwarted by Nemesis the Warlock, who reformed the ABC Warriors to help save the Gothic Empire from invasion and later to train the Goths in combat. They re-joined Nemesis as he ventured into the Time Wastes of Termight to find his son, Thoth. With Mad Ronn lost, their numbers were bolstered by Hammerstein's former Ro-Busters comrade Mek-Quake. The team ventured to the end of the world, and lost a second member when Hitaki was killed during the first encounter with the Monad. Adding Ro-Jaws to the team, The Warlock dispatched The Warriors into the Time Wastes alone to repair the damage done by Thoth, and stop the destruction of the planet.\n\nDuring the mission, Hammerstein met and became close to a human female, Terri, who believed herself to be a robot. She had mistaken him for Craig, the father of her baby, and became equally infatuated with the ageing warrior; without the proper modifications, however, Hammerstein had no way to return her affections. The two became fiercely protective of each other, and made plans to find some remote planet and settle down. With Terri's untimely death during the final confrontation with the Monad, Hammerstein realized he was doomed to be an eternal soldier, only finding pleasure in war and destruction.\n\nHe temporarily relinquished command to Deadlock, which saw the Warriors drawn into his quest to bring Khaos to the galaxy. For most of this mission, Hammerstein was bewildered and disgusted by the task and the lunatic excesses of his comrades. The most reluctant of all The Warriors to embrace Khaos, he finally realized that he did not have to obey orders any longer and renounced Deadlock's leadership.\n\nThe Warriors went their own ways. Hammerstein agreed to let Blackblood (now an arms dealer) give him a service, only to find himself welded to a workbench, used for testing new weaponry and deliberately tortured for five years. With the help of Deadlock, Hammerstein escaped and pulled the Warriors together again to stop the Terran ship Hellbringer. During this, it was shown he was loyal to Khaos and had some understanding of it, more so than some of his comrades like Joe.\n\nIn the battle against Hellbringer a demon overloaded his neural net with all the repressed guilt from his long career, almost killing him before he took out his fury on the demon. He also discovered the other Warriors had all known he was being tortured but had deliberately not come to save him, as \"Nobody likes a nice guy!\" - Morrigun even informed him that his innate goodness was against the order of things and this was why bad things happened to him.\n\nHe led the team back to Mars afterwards, initially to tackle a group of zombies calling themselves the Jung Cannibals. They were caught in the Medusa War where Medusa, the planetary consciousness, tried to wipe out her human settlers. Hammerstein struck a deal with the spirit and kidnapped human Mars President D.W. Cobb, though he didn't know Deadlock planned to turn Cobb into a Martian as an act of appeasement.\n\nCobb's 'transformation' sparked a civil war, with the Confederacy of Martian Industries on one side and the Union of Martian Free States on the other. Hammerstein led the ABC Warriors in attempting to force a peace, leading to the Confederacy hiring a seven-strong robot mercenary gang called the Shadow Warriors to assassinate them. The battle saw Hammerstein infected with parasitical brain-eating robot snakes, forced to be killed or let them kill his comrades, and though he escaped the situation he was left severely wounded. He managed to kill the Warrior responsible, Doc Maniacus, with his own snakes.\n\nCurrently, Hammerstein is leading the ABC Warriors to rescue Zippo, a robot comrade from the Volgan War.\n\n\nIn 1995, Pat Mills wrote the Judge Dredd story \"Hammerstein\" which placed the eponymous robot into Dredd's world.\n\nIn this story, Hammerstein rejoined the American army after the Mars mission, serving under General Blood 'n' Guts in President Robert L. Booth's robot armies. Following the great Atomic Wars of 2070, Hammerstein fought in The Battle of Armageddon against the Mega City Judges. Following the robot's defeat, Hammerstein was trapped under the Cursed Earth for decades before emerging, whereupon he faced off against Judge Dredd. Realizing the war was over and the Judges were no longer his enemy, Hammerstein became unsure of his purpose.\n\nHowever, the subsequent story \"ABC Warriors: The Volgan War\" removes this story from continuity by having the original war against the Volgans taking place in 2083, 13 years after the Atomic Wars in Judge Dredd.\n\nHammerstein arguably appeared in the 1995 film \"Judge Dredd\". Although not named, he was identified as an ABC Warrior and his appearance was similar to that of Hammerstein.\n\n"}

The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.\n\nBetween 900 and 1580, up to 1500 Pueblo Indians lived in the area where they hunted game and cultivated food. Native peoples first settled in the area in the late 10th century of the Pueblo II Era, living in dispersed farmstead dwellings at the east side of the Jemez Mountains. Their settlements increased and changed over time in the Pueblo III Era, when they lived in larger, concentrated villages of Otowi, Puye, Shufinne, Tsankawi, Tsirege, and Tyuonyi.\n\nThe Puye Cliffs complex, the largest complex on the Pajarito Plateau, includes two levels of cliff-dwellings and surface and cave dwellings. The two levels of cliff dwellings, the mesa top and reconstructed 'Community House' are accessed by paths and about twelve stairways and ladders cut into the side of the cliff. One level of cliff dwellings is over long and the second is about long.\n\nThe dwellings were carved out of soft volcanic tuff on about a cliff ridge. The rock is relatively soft and can be excavated using wooden tools. The cliff dwellings held about 740 rooms and ruins at the base of the cliff that likely held additional dwellings. On top of the mesa are cave dwellings of the Pueblo II Era around which a multi-storied puebloan village was built. The south portion of the complex had 173 rooms on the ground floor. The total number of rooms is not known, but would include rooms on the northern side of the complex and the upper levels. In the center of the complex was a large plaza.\n\nAbout 1580 (after the end of the Pueblo IV Era) drought finally forced the villagers to leave for locations nearer to the Rio Grande valley. Present day inhabitants of Santa Clara Pueblo, some to the east, are descendants of the Puye. The American Indians living in pueblo in northern New Mexico traditionally speak the Tewa language. The Tewa name 'Puye' can be translated as 'pueblo ruin where the rabbits assemble or meet'.\n\nIn 1907 Edgar Hewett, with the Southwest Society of the Archeological Institute of America, excavated Puye Cliffs. It was the first systematic excavation of a prehistoric pueblo in the Rio Grande valley.\n\nThe cliff dwellings were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966, under the name of \"Puye Ruins.\"\n\nIn 2000, a planned burn of trees in Bandelier National Monument burned out of control. The resulting wildfire, known as the Cerro Grande Fire, eventually claimed , some 250 houses in Los Alamos, and devastated Santa Clara Canyon. Puye Cliff Dwellings site has recently (2009) been reopened to the public. Current information can be obtained from Santa Clara Pueblo.\n\nTours can be scheduled to explore the cliffs and learn of their history.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1914764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914764", "title": "Pons Sublicius", "text": "Pons Sublicius\n\nThe Pons Sublicius is the earliest known bridge of ancient Rome, spanning the Tiber River near the Forum Boarium (\"cattle forum\") downstream from the Tiber Island, near the foot of the Aventine Hill. According to tradition, its construction was ordered by Ancus Marcius around 642 BC, but this date is approximate because there is no ancient record of its construction. Marcius wished to connect the newly fortified Janiculum Hill on the Etruscan side to the rest of Rome, augmenting the ferry that was there. The bridge was part of public works projects that included building a port at Ostia, at the time the location of worked salt deposits.\n\nLegend tells us that the bridge was made entirely of wood. The name comes from Latin \"pons, pontis\", \"bridge,\" and the adjective \"sublicius\", \"resting on pilings,\" from the stem of \"sublicae\", pilings. As a \"sublica\" was a pick, \"sublicae\" implies pointed sticks; that is, the bridge was supported by pilings driven into the riverbed. Julius Caesar’s engineers used this construction to bridge the Rhine.\n\nThe bridge was rebuilt repeatedly. The date of its final disappearance is not known, but it is not in classical times. The Via Latina went over the bridge and connected to the Via Cassia, a road built over an old Etruscan road that led to Veii. The bridge was a favorite resort for beggars, who used to sit upon it and demand alms, hence the Latin expression \"aliquis de ponte\" for a beggar.\n\nThe bridge was downstream from the Pons Aemilius, a good stone bridge with which it is sometimes confused. Between the two, the Cloaca Maxima, or Great Sewer, was effluent into the Tiber.\n\nIn the drawing by Friedrich Polack (published 1896) included with this article the pile bridge is falsely shown as a pile pier. Presumably some structure still existed prior to 1896, which was incorrectly identified. Otherwise the drawing appears to be accurate in the major details.\n\nThe observer is standing on the Via Ostiensis at the foot of the Aventine, which is at his back. The river flows toward him. The stone bridge in evidence is the Pons Aemilius. The Servian Wall goes along the bank of the river, is pierced by the Porta Trigemina (you can see the three openings) and starts up the Aventine. Beyond the gate is the Forum Boarium. In the immediate foreground are the docks, or Navalia.\n\nThe pier is highly unlikely, as any ship tied up at it as shown would be unstable in the full force of the current. Moreover, the masts would have to be shipped for passage under the bridges. One can readily see how unsuitable the river was for sea-going traffic and how necessary the port of Ostia would have been to Rome.\n\nThe opening of the Cloaca Maxima is between the docks and the stone bridge. Beyond the bridge you can just see the Aesculapium on Tiber Island. Looming over the whole scene is the Capitoline, with the temple of Juppiter Capitolinus upon it. The rising ground on the opposite side of the stone bridge is the Janiculum.\n\nThe legend of Publius Horatius Cocles at the bridge appears in many classical authors, most notably in Livy.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Roman monarchy in 509 BC, the exile of the royal family and the king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and the establishment of the Roman Republic, Tarquinius sought military aid to regain the throne from the Etruscan king of Clusium, Lars Porsena. Porsena led his army against Rome in 508 BC. The battle went badly for the Romans, and the Etruscan army surged towards the bridge. The Romans initially fell back. However, Horatius, with the assistance of Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius Aquilinus, sought to buy time and halt the attack by defending the opposite end of the bridge while the Roman soldiers broke the bridge.\n\nIn modern English literature, the story of Horatius at the bridge was re-told by Thomas Babington Macaulay in his poem \"\", published as part of his \"Lays of Ancient Rome\" (1842).\n\nThe Pons Sublicius is also the bridge over which Gaius Gracchus directed his flight when he was overtaken by his opponents (Plutarch, \"Life of Gaius Gracchus\"). Two of his friends attempted to stop them at the bridge, but were themselves killed. Gracchus died violently shortly after in a grove nearby. Roman citizens cheered on the flight of Gracchus but would not assist him. Gracchus' choice of an escape route was probably intended to make use of the magical powers attributed to the bridge, but it failed.\n\nOn the Ides of May, the procession of the Argei went from the temple of Fors Fortuna, built by Servius Tullius, to the pons Sublicius. (There is no reference for this version of events; this ritual is somewhat unclear and may be the same as the Roman Liberalia.) Alternately, Samuel Ball Platner explains that the ritual involved priests travelling to all (27 or 30) of the shrines \"(sacella)\" called Argei in the original 4 regions of Rome before arriving at the Pons Sublicius. The pontiffs and the magistrates were carrying straw effigies of bound men, also called Argei, which the Vestals threw into the Tiber. The Flaminica Dialis was dressed in mourning.\n\nThe ceremony has sometimes been interpreted as an Etruscan magical military tactic, comparable to another in which a Gallic man and woman were buried alive in the Forum Boarium. The Greeks and the Gauls were being ritually buried or drowned, which the superstitious Romans believed had a real effect on their Greek or Gallic enemies. They carried out this type of sacrifice also after major defeats.\n\nThe publication \"Papers of the British School at Rome\", volume 72, 2004, contains an article by Pier Luigi Tucci, \"Eight Fragments of the Marble Plan of Rome Shedding New Light on the Transtiberim\", where he claims that fragments 138a–f and 574a–b of the Forma Urbis, a marble plan of Rome from the time of Septimius Severus, show the right bank of the Tiber, opposite the Aventine. A road appears there, formerly thought to cross the Pons Aemilius, but shown on the \"forma\" crossing another bridge, the last remains of which were removed in the late nineteenth century. This bridge is thought to have been the pons Sublicius. For an update, see Pier Luigi Tucci, ‘The Pons Sublicius: a reinvestigation,’ \"Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome\", volume 56-57 (2011-2012), pp. 177–212\n\n\n"}

The Wallachian army led by Voivod Mircea cel Bătrân (Mircea \"the Elder\") opposed the Ottoman invasion personally led by Sultan Bayezid I \"the Lightning\". The Turkish force heavily outnumbered the Wallachian troops. The legend says that on the eve of the battle, dressed as a peace emissary, Mircea cel Bătrân talked to Bayezid asking him to leave Wallachia and promising him safe passage back. The Sultan proudly insisted on fighting.\n\nThe battle took place probably near the Argeș River, but the exact location is disputed. The Wallachian victory is confirmed by numerous sources and historians.\n\nDuring the battle, a key tactical role was played by the Wallachian archers who severely depleted the Ottoman ranks during their initial attack. Bayezid's vassals, the Serbian lords Stefan Lazarević and Marko Mrnjavčević, two of the greatest knights of the time, participated and fought bravely; Stefan showed great courage, Marko was killed in action.\n\nAn alternative historical view is that the dramatic confrontation lasted not just a single day, but an entire week, being in the first stage a war of positions. The fierce battle ended with heavy casualties for both sides, eventually each army withdrawing from the battlefield. Although Wallachians pushed back the enemy, the Ottomans were able to defend their resulting position relying on the personal guard of the Sultan composed of Janissaries. This was the impregnable position of the Ottoman defense a year later, in the famous Battle of Nicopolis. This tactical innovation became a fundamental element of the Ottoman war strategies until the 18th century. The army of Mircea, sustaining heavy casualties, and unable to break the defense of the Sultan's camp, was finally obliged to withdraw. Because the Ottoman Empire was not able to conquer Wallachia at this time, Rovine remains one of the most important battles in Romanian history.\n\nAn epic description of the confrontation is presented in the poem \"Scrisoarea a III-a\" (\"The Third Letter\") written by the Romanian national poet, Mihai Eminescu. The Dečani chronicle describes the battle and reports that Prince Marko and Constantine Dragaš died fighting. The same source mentions that Marko's brother, Andreja Mrnjavčević, also perished during the fight.\n"}

Researchers observed that when the goat propelled itself forward, it extended its back legs and the front legs were tucked close up to its chest during its first phase. During the second phase the goat raised its back legs near to its chest, while the front legs humerus stayed locked in a persistent location relative to the goat's chest, therefore allowing the elbow to be detained in close proximity to the whole body's center of balance. Extension of the elbow and carpal joints resulted in a vertical translation of the center of mass up the mountain slope.\n"}

He played for the Cyprus national football team, and he is the all-time leading scorer with 32 goals in 85 appearances. \nHe also played for Iraklis, Panathinaikos and Olympiacos in Greece.\n\nBorn in Paralimni, he got his start in professional football playing for hometown side Enosis Neon Paralimni, for whom he scored 17 goals in 25 games in the 1996/97 season and became top goal scorer of Cypriot Championship.\n\nPicked up by Iraklis Thessaloniki in Greece in 1997, his four seasons produced a total of 61 goals in 119 appearances as he also played in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn 2001, in a deal which took three Panathinaikos players to Iraklis, Konstantinou transferred to Panathinaikos for €15 million. It was a successful purchase, but many believed that the young Cypriot striker was worth less than the expenditure of €15 million made by Panathinaikos – the highest figure ever paid for a player in the Greek Superleague. With Panathinaikos, he had the opportunity to play in the Champions League, earning praise for his performances in attack. There he found with the Portuguese players Paulo Sousa and later Robert Jarni, taking Panathinakos a long way in the competition. He scored a beautiful 45m goal in the Nou Camp return in the quarter-final against Barcelona in the Champions 2001/02. Panathinaikos seemed to ensure its marking the semi-finals, as they were needed 3 goals to go to the Spaniards. Barça, however, came back and won 3–1, qualifying for the semi-finals.\n\nIn 2004/05 he had 15 goals. Konstantinou scored against the champions in a 1–0 home win, at the end of the season Konstantinou did not renew with Panathinaikos, because he stated that he was going to continue his footballing career in a league of higher value to gain better experience.\n\nThat summer though, he was not signed by a club overseas and was signed by Olympiacos.\n\nAs an Olympiacos player he won with his team the double for 2005/06 and made it two in his career. At the Greek Cup final in 2005/06, where Olympiacos beat AEK Athens 3–0, Konstantinou scored Olympiacos' first goal. He also notably scored a late strike to make it 1–2 in the early season league victory of Olympiacos against AEK Athens (final score 1–3) and a crowd-pleaser against his former team, Panathinaikos, to make it 3–1 (match ended 3–2). He became for the second consecutive time champion again with Olympiakos in 2007, even though the season was full of personal injuries and bad luck, he still managed to perform well on some important matches, most notably scoring on the away Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk. During the 2007–2008 season, he has suffered from injuries and has lost his starting position to Darko Kovacevic. It was the last season at Olympiakos.\n\nKonstantinou started the 2008–09 season in Greece at Iraklis where he started his career in Greece in 1997. He spent some seasons at Iraklis before going to Panathinaikos back in 1997. Here he played 13 matches of which he scored three goals.\n\nHalfway through the 2008–2009 season, Konstantinou was transferred to Cyprus to play for Omonia. During the 2009–2010 season, he scored several goals for the club, including in derbies against rivals APOEL, Anorthosis, and Apollon. After taking a leadership and mentor role with the team in his first full season in 2010, Konstantinou helped Omonoia to win its 20th Cypriot Championship and in the club he found his couch Takis Lemonis that was also his coach in Olympiacos.\n\nIn Summer 2011, Konstantinou signed a contract with Anorthosis Famagusta.\n\nIn Summer 2012, Konstantinou signed a one-year contract with AEL Limassol.\n\nIn January 2014, he announced his retirement from football as a player.\n\nHe made his international debut against Albania in August 1998 and subsequently averaged almost a goal every other game in his first 35 caps.

At a time when few women were financially self-sufficient, Kerr made her way from Maryland’s Eastern Shore to New York City, where she supported herself as a magazine editor and a writer of more than 500 short stories, 23 novels, several poems and a play that ran on Broadway.\n\nHer bequest to Washington College on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in 1965 stipulated that the proceeds of the $578,000 endowment be used to fund an annual literary prize and to support literary events and scholarships at the college. Since 1968, the college in Chestertown has awarded more than $1.4 million in prize money to promising young writers and has enabled Washington College to bring a succession of the nation’s literary luminaries to the small liberal arts college located just 30 miles from where she grew up.\n\nThe childhood home of Sophie Kerr, a circa 1860 farmhouse on the corner of 5th and Kerr Avenues in Denton, Maryland, still stands. She specifically describes the house in her short story, “Coming Home for Christmas.”\n\nBorn in the Caroline County town of Denton, Maryland, in 1880, Sophie Kerr graduated from Denton High School in 1895 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Hood College and a master's degree from the University of Vermont. She married John DeLoss Underwood, a civil engineer, in 1904 and divorced him four years later.\n\nIn order to support herself, Kerr went into journalism, launching her career in Pittsburgh, Pa. as the women’s page editor at the \"Chronicle Telegraph\" and the \"Pittsburgh Gazette\". Moving to New York, she became managing editor of \"The Woman's Home Companion\". and published her fiction in other popular magazines of the day, including \"Saturday Evening Post\", \"Collier’s Saturday Review of Literature\" and \"McCalls\". From 1920 until her death in 1965 at age 84, Kerr lived in a brownstone residence at 115 East 38th Street, where she created something of a literary salon for her friends in publishing and theater. In 1942, as part of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of co-education at Washington College, she accepted an honorary degree along with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nWhile her fiction is largely unknown to contemporary readers and her books are long out of print, her stories dealt with class and gender issues at work in the first half of the 20th century. “Kerr wrote stories about plucky heroines, young women who rose to the challenge and went for the gusto. They had big dreams and lots of charm and tons of blond curls. For the most part, they were smart and unassuming and hopelessly, wonderfully, kind, but they had ambition. Even her seemingly vapid heroines had hearts of gold and wills of iron hidden under all their finery.”\n\nIn her will, she left the bulk of her estate to Washington College, with the stipulation that half its income would be awarded annually to the senior showing “the most ability and promise for future fulfillment in the field of literary endeavor.” The other half funds scholarships, student publications and a series of visits by renowned writers.\n\nThe Sophie Kerr Prize is awarded each year to a graduating senior at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland who has demonstrated the best ability and promise for future fulfillment in the field of literary endeavor. The prize is announced in New York City. Valued at $65,768 in 2016, it is the nation's largest undergraduate literary prize. Indeed, it is among the largest in the world, exceeding the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, and National Book Critics Circle.\n\nApplicants submit portfolios of what they deem to be their best writing, which may include critical essays, creative nonfiction, poetry, fiction, journalism, stage plays, screenplays, blogging, graphic novels, or other hybrid forms. In a typical year, between 20 and 30 seniors submit portfolios for consideration. In the past, the prize has been awarded for both creative and critical writing. The 2011 Sophie Kerr Prize was awarded to Lisa Jones, an anthropology major who wrote about her life-changing trip to Tanzania. In a break from tradition, Washington College announced the winner at the Poets House in New York City where Sophie Kerr lived for more than 40 years.\n\nThe first Sophie Kerr Prize, valued at $9,000, was awarded to a Washington College senior in 1968.

During the French Revolution Cartellier was part of a team of sculptors who worked on the church of Ste. Geneviève in Paris to convert it to the Panthéon.\n\nAt a time in European history when ancient works were the measure by which all statuary was judged, in 1801 Cartellier obtained wide recognition after exhibiting a plaster version of his statue of \"Modesty\" that was based on the free-standing statue of the Capitoline Venus in Rome. At the Bourbon Restoration he was given the commission to do the bronze equestrian statue of King Louis XIV that can be seen in the \"cour d'honneur\" of Versailles. At the time of his death only the horse had been cast. His son-in-law Louis Petitot completed it with the king's figure.\n\nCartellier sculpted the model for the bronze statue of Dominique Vivant, baron Denon (1747–1825), that adorns his tomb at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. However, Cartellier's best known work came in 1825 when he was commissioned by Vivant's close friends Eugène and Hortense de Beauharnais who wanted him to sculpt a monument for the tomb of their mother, the Empress Joséphine. Cartellier's statue, modeled from Josephine's kneeling image in the painting of the coronation of Napoléon Bonaparte by Jacques-Louis David, can be seen at the Church of Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul in Rueil-Malmaison.\n\nCartellier was made a member of Institut de France, of the Legion of Honor (1808) and decorated with the Order of St-Michel (1824).

Dobson began as a painter, and his early work was influenced by cubism, vorticism, and futurism. After World War I, however, he turned increasingly toward sculpture in a more or less realist style. Throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s he built a reputation as an outstanding sculptor and was among the first in Britain to prefer direct carving of the material rather than modelling a maquette first. The simplified forms and flowing lines of much of his sculptures, particularly his female nudes, showed the influence of African art. From 1946 to 1953 Dobson was Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1953. While Dobson was one of the most esteemed artists of his time, after his death his reputation declined with the move towards postmodernism and conceptual art. However, in recent years a revival has begun. Dobson is now seen as one of the most important British sculptors of the 20th century.\n\nDobson was born in central London and grew up in Clerkenwell. His mother was Alice Mary Owen and his father, who was also named Frank Dobson, was a commercial artist who specialized in bird and flower designs for greeting card companies. The younger Dobson attended school in Forest Gate and then in Harrow. When his father died in 1900, the fourteen year old Dobson was sent to live with an aunt in Hastings. There he attended evening classes at the Hastings School of Art and was then trained as an apprentice with Sir William Reynolds-Stephens. After eighteen months in Reynolds-Stephen's studio, Dobson moved to Devon and then to Cornwall where he lived, for two years, by selling landscape paintings. In 1906 he obtained a scholarship to study at the art institute in Hospitalfield House in Arbroath and studied there for four years. From 1910 to 1912 Dobson attended the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, after which he returned to Cornwall. In Newlyn, he met Augustus John who used his influence and contacts to enable Dobson to stage a one-man show at the Chenil Gallery in London in 1914. In, or around, 1915 Dobson created his first sculpture, a small piece in wood.\n\nIn 1915, during the First World War, Dobson enlisted in The Artists Rifles and served in France from October 1916 as a Lieutenant with the 5th Border Regiment. In January 1917 he developed a duodenal ulcer and returned to England. In April 1918 he married Cordelia Clara Tregurtha, whom he had first met in Newlyn. Dobson was formally invalided out of the Army in November 1918 and by then had already submitted several drawings to the British War Memorials Committee and was commissioned to paint a barrage balloon site on the Thames estuary. The Air Force representatives on the Committee did not approve of the picture and Dobson did not receive any further official commissions. Dobson set up a studio in the Tregurtha family home in Newlyn but towards the end of the war he took a studio in Manresa Road in Chelsea and would live there until the start of the Second World War.\n\nThroughout the 1920s Dobson focused increasingly on sculpture, exhibited work in several influential exhibitions and played a leading role in a number of artistic groups. He was the only sculptor to take part in the 1920 Group X exhibition. Dobson was a founding member of the London Artists Association and spent three years as President of the London Group between 1923 and 1927. He made bronze portraits of several public figures. At the Group X exhibition he exhibited two sculptures and studies of Ben Nicholson and his bronze head of H. H. Asquith was shown at the Leicester Galleries in late 1921. Other subjects included Osbert Sitwell, Lydia Lopokova and Tallulah Bankhead. Dobson exhibited at the Venice Biennale in both 1924 and in 1926, was featured in the 1925 Tri-National Exhibition which visited London, Paris and New York and was also included in the 1926 European artists exhibition that toured America and Canada. In March 1927 he had his first major one-man exhibition when the Leicester Galleries exhibited twenty-three of his sculptures and several bronzes.\n\nIn 1930 the Tate purchased a larger-than-life sculpture from Dobson and erected it outside the gallery on Millbank. During the early 1930s Dobson continued to receive portrait conmmissions, most notably for Sir Edward Marsh and the actress Margaret Rawlings. Dobson worked in other media including textiles and silver, as well. His silver gilt cup, \"Calix Majestatis\", to mark the coronation of George VI and Queen Elizabeth is now in the Royal Collection. During 1933 Dobson fractured his left arm which greatly limited his ability for heavy carving and his last monumental stone carving was to be \"Pax\", which was first shown at the London Group in 1935.\n\nAt the start of World War Two, Dobson and his second wife, whom he had married in 1931, moved to Bristol, where a large retrospective of his work was held in March 1940. Dobson lived in the city throughout the Bristol Blitz and like several other artists painted the ruins of churches destroyed in the bombing. Dobson contacted the War Artists' Advisory Committee and offered his services as both a painter and sculptor. WAAC were reluctant to offer sculpture commissions but eventually did offer Dobson a short-term contract for two portrait busts of Naval personal. Later WAAC commissioned some paintings, including one of workers arriving for work at a factory that had been relocated to a tunnel.\n\nDobson was appointed head of sculpture at the Royal College of Art in 1946, a post he held until his retirement in 1953. For the Festival of Britain site on the South Bank of the Thames in 1951, Dobson created \"London Pride\". The sculpture was originally exhibited as a plaster cast but was later, after Dobson died, cast as a bronze and placed in front of the Royal National Theatre in 1987. Among his last commissions were a bronze head of Sir Thomas Lipton and the zodiac clock on the exterior wall of Bracken House in London.\n\nDobson died in 1963 and his ashes were scattered in the Thames.\n\nIn 1995 the art critic Brian Sewell recalled the great loss of much of Dobson's work after his death: \"After his death, his widow asked me to help her clear the studio at Stamford Bridge, and I was appalled at the destruction that she wrought, smashing to smithereens small clay and terracotta models, tearing fine drawings in red and black chalk, hundreds of them, the fragments in a dustbin, all because the subjects were erotic. I was allowed to save pastel drawings of exotic and rare birds, and watercolours of farmyards and a pastoral life long gone, but for the figures engaged in sexual congress, face to face, head to toe and doggy style as explicit as any by his old friend Eric Gill, Mrs Dobson would accept no plea that they were beautiful, no argument that they were fired by a quality not to be found in the “pure essence” of the torsos that survive, and like a ferociously implacable angel at the Last Judgment, she bent to the business of destruction.\"\n\nFrank Dobson Square was constructed by London County Council in 1963, the year of Dobson's death to commemorate his life and work. The centrepiece of the square was the \"Woman and Fish\" fountain, a sculpture designed and completed by Dobson in 1951.\n"}

It continues the story some two years after the point where \"The Well of Lost Plots\" leaves off.\n\nThe book sees Thursday return from the world of fiction to the alternative Swindon that Fforde introduced in \"The Eyre Affair\"; she is accompanied by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, whose excursion from the world of fiction with Thursday forms the main sub-plot.\n\nThe title is taken from \"Hamlet\" I.iv: \"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark\".\n\nThe story opens with Thursday still in the world of fiction in her job as the Bellman, head of the literary police force Jurisfiction. She is still hunting the Minotaur that escaped in the last book; she is tiring of fiction, however, and longs to return to her own world and get back her husband Landen, who was removed from time by the evil Goliath Corporation in 1947. Despite Landen's non-existence, Thursday still has her son (Friday Next) who is now two years old.\n\nThursday and Friday return to her mother (Wednesday) in Swindon, with Hamlet who is accompanying them on an excursion to the \"Outland\" to find out what people in the real world think of him. Her mother, whose main functions appear to be to make tea and to provide Battenberg cake, has some curious house guests: Emma Hamilton, Otto von Bismarck, and a family of dodos. Both humans are apparently staying for a rest, while Thursday's father (who has now been re-admitted to the time-travelling ChronoGuard) sorts out various parts of history for them.\n\nDespite her earlier transgressions that caused her to flee to the Bookworld in the first place, Thursday gets her job back at SpecOps-27 as a Literary Detective and catches up with her old colleagues. She learns that in her absence, Yorrick Kaine has joined forces with Goliath Corporation and plans to oust the ageing English President George Formby. As Prime Minister, Kaine wields some mysterious persuasive influence over Parliament and the people, and has used it to pass some bizarre laws and to stir up hatred of Denmark. Yorrick has also taken out a hit on her: he has hired an assassin known as \"The Windowmaker\", who is actually Cindy Stoker, the wife of Thursday's longtime friend, Spike.\n\nThursday's father warns her that Kaine's ambitions may cause nuclear armageddon and that it is up to her to stop him. On top of this, she is visited by tearful agents from the Bookworld (Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Emperor Zhark) who tell her that all sorts of things are going wrong without her leadership'; for starters, without its titular character, the play Hamlet has merged with The Merry Wives of Windsor creating a new play called \"The Merry Wives of Elsinore\", which is not nearly as good as either original play (in the words of Emperor Zhark, \"it takes a long time to get funny, and, when it finally does, everyone dies\"). Meanwhile, her most pressing problem is finding reliable childcare for Friday.\n\nGoliath Corporation have decided to become the new world religion to avoid a prophecy (the prophecy states that the Goliath Corporation will fall; Goliath believes that converting itself into a religion will exempt it from destruction, as the prophecy specifies a business). Thursday meets the CEO—at their headquarters in the Isle of Man—and gets a promise that they will un-eradicate Landen in exchange for her forgiveness. Thursday feels duped when she finds that, through some form of mind control, she has formally forgiven them, even though there is no sign of her husband. Then suddenly he is back, but takes a while to stabilise. Thursday must wait patiently for his un-eradication to \"stick\". In the meantime, she embarks on several seemingly impossible tasks, which include smuggling ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into Wales, tracking down an illegal clone of William Shakespeare, and teaching Friday to speak properly.\n\nOn top of all of this, Thursday still has to help the Swindon Mallets win the 1988 Croquet Superhoop final to thwart Kaine and Goliath and avoid the impending end of the world (as foretold by the aforementioned prophecy).\n\nShe succeeds but not without a near-death experience and a visit to the gateway to the Underworld (which turns out to be a planned-but-never-built service station on the M4 motorway). The final chapters contain some curious time paradoxes in which Thursday finds that she has met herself at several other stages in her own lifespan, including one character which had seemed to be an independent character.\n"}
{"id": "1914839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914839", "title": "Glasgow School", "text": "Glasgow School\n\nThe Glasgow School was a circle of influential artists and designers that began to coalesce in Glasgow, Scotland in the 1870s, and flourished from the 1890s to around 1910. Representative groups included The Four (also known as the Spook School), the Glasgow Girls and the Glasgow Boys. Part of the international Art Nouveau movement, they were responsible for creating the distinctive Glasgow Style.\n\nGlasgow experienced an economic boom at the end of the 19th century, resulting in an increase in distinctive contributions to the Art Nouveau movement, particularly in the fields of architecture, interior design and painting.\n\nAmong the most prominent definers of the Glasgow School collective were The Four. They were the painter and glass artist Margaret MacDonald, acclaimed architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (MacDonald's husband), MacDonald's sister Frances and Herbert MacNair. Together, The Four defined the Glasgow Style's fusion of influences including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe. The Four, otherwise known as the Spook School, ultimately made a significant impact on the definition of Art Nouveau. The name, Spook School, or Spooky or Ghoul School, was originally a \"derisive epithet\" given to their work which \"distorted and conventionalized human... form.\"\n\nThe Glasgow Girls is the name now used for a group of female designers and artists including Margaret and Frances MacDonald, both of whom were members of The Four, Jessie M. King, Annie French, Helen Paxton Brown, Jessie Wylie Newbery, Ann Macbeth, Bessie MacNicol, Norah Neilson Gray, Stansmore Dean, Eleanor Allen Moore, De Courcy Lewthwaite Dewar, the silversmith Agnes Banks Harvey and Christian Jane Fergusson. May Wilson and Eliza Bell, among others, continued the tradition of ceramic artistry into the 1940s and 1950s by hand painting various items with floral patterns.\n\nWomen were able to flourish in Glasgow during a \"period of enlightenment\" that took place between 1885 and 1920, where women were actively pursuing art careers and the Glasgow School of Art had a significant period of \"international visibility\". This is sometimes attributed to the \"influential\" and \"progressive\" head of the art school, Fra Newbery, who established an environment in which women could flourish, both as students and as teachers. Women benefited from the new Glasgow Society of Lady Artists (founded 1882) which offered a place for women artists to meet and also had exhibition space. In addition, many art school students and staff were involved in women's suffrage. \"Students took turns between classes stitching up banners\" for the movement.\n\nThe name \"Glasgow Girls\" emerged much later. In the 1960s there was an attempt to give due attention to the work of the city’s women artists to balance the plentiful discussion of the Glasgow Boys. It is thought that the then head of the Scottish Arts Council William Buchanan was the first to use the name in the catalogue for a 1968 Glasgow Boys exhibition. This \"invention\" has been called an \"ironic reference\" to the equivalent men’s grouping. The term Glasgow Girls was emphasised by a major exhibition \"Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920\" organised by Jude Burkhauser in 1990.\n\nThrough the 1880s and 1890s, around the same time that the Spook School was gaining prominence, a collective which came to be known as the Glasgow Boys was interpreting and expanding the canon of Impressionist and post-impressionist painting. Their subject matter featured rural, prosaic scenes from in and around Glasgow. Their colorful depictions attempted to capture the many facets of the character of Scotland.\n\nThe Glasgow Boys consisted of several men, most of whom were trained in, or had strong ties to the city of Glasgow. These men were brought together by a passion for realism and naturalism and this showed through in the pieces they produced. Along with this passion for naturalism, they shared a marked distaste for the Edinburgh oriented Scottish art establishment, which they viewed as oppressive. Driven and motivated by these ideals they embraced change, created masterpieces, and became Scottish icons in the process.\n\nThere were three distinct waves of Glasgow Boys. The leading figures of the first wave were James Paterson (1854–1932) and William York Macgregor (1855-1923), and the group used to meet at Macgregor's studio. The second wave was represented in Joseph Crawhall (1861–1913), Thomas Millie Dow (1848-1919), James Guthrie (1859–1930), George Henry (1858–1943), E. A. Hornel (1864–1933), James Whitelaw Hamilton (1860-1932) and E. A. Walton (1860–1922). The third wave of artists were David Gauld (1865–1936), William Kennedy (1859–1918), John Lavery (1856–1941), Harrington Mann (1864-1937), Stuart Park (1862–1933), William Wells (1872–1923), David Young Cameron (1865–1945), Alexander Ignatius Roche (1861–1923), Arthur Melville (1855–1904), Thomas Corsan Morton (1859-1928), James Nairn (1859–1904), George Pirie (1863-1946) and John Quinton Pringle (1864–1925).\n\nTheir main influences were that of Japanese print, French Realism including Jules Bastien-Lepage, and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, but all of their experiences around the world greatly impacted on and inspired their work, in particular in Spain, North Africa, and Japan. The group was constantly influenced by what they saw in the world around them and strove to display these images by utilizing the techniques of realism and naturalism; they had a passion to depict things as they actually are. This is one of the reasons that the group often chose to work outdoors. Working outdoors allowed them to produce paintings that were as true to nature as possible and it allowed them to paint realistic objects in their natural environment. They painted real people in real places. The production of naturalistic paintings was new to this time period, and thus their techniques were considered to be innovative. Similarly, the pieces often created a sense of movement, an accurate (or naturalistic) depiction of light and shade, and extremely realistic texture. This made them stand out in the art community.\n\nA large collection of work from the Glasgow Boys is held in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, where one room is dedicated to the group. The museum houses more than 60 of the Boys' pieces that were created between 1880 and 1900, arguably the time period in which their best, and most innovative, pieces were produced. More of their works can be found on display at the Burrell Collection, Broughton House, Paisley Museum and Art Galleries, Walker Art Gallery and the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1914845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914845", "title": "Parosmia", "text": "Parosmia\n\nParosmia is a dysfunction with smell detection that is characterized by the inability of the brain to properly identify an odor's \"natural\" smell. What happens instead, is that the natural odor is transcribed into what is most often described as an unpleasant aroma, typically a \"'burned,' 'rotting,' 'fecal,' or 'chemical' smell\". The term is from the Greek παρά \"pará\" and ὀσμή \"osmḗ\". There are rare instances, however, of pleasant odors; this is more specifically called euosmia (Greek).\n\nThere are numerous diseases that parosmia is associated with. In the case study cited above, Frasnelli \"et al.\" examined five patients that endured parosmia or phantosmia, most as a result of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). It is hypothesized that URTIs can result in parosmia because of damage to olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs).\nExposure to harmful solvents has also been linked to parosmia and more specifically damaging ORNs.\nDamage to these neurons could end in the inability to correctly encode a signal representing a particular odor, which would send an erroneous signal to the odor processing center, the olfactory bulb. This, in turn, leads to the signal activating a different trigger, i.e. a different smell, than the stimulating odor, and thus the patient cannot sync the input and output odors. Damage to ORNs describes a peripheral defect in the pathway, but there are also instances where damage to the processing center in the brain can lead to distorted odors as well.\n\nDifferent types of head trauma could also lead to dysfunctions that relate to what the afflicted brain area controls. In humans, the olfactory bulb is located on the inferior side of the brain. Physical damage to this area would alter how the area processes information in a variety of ways, but there are also other types of diseases that can alter how this area works. If the part of the brain that interprets these input signals is damaged, then a distorted output is possible. This would also lead to parosmia. Temporal lobe epilepsy has also led to cases of parosmia, but these were only temporary; the onset of parosmia was a seizure and it typically lasted a week or two after.\nParosmia is also a known symptom for Parkinson's disease, though not ubiquitous for patients with it, and although the specific pathway is undetermined, the lack of dopamine has resulted in documented cases of parosmia and phantosmia.\n\nOne method used to establish parosmia is the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, or UPSIT. \"Sniffin' Sticks\" are another method that can be used to properly diagnose parosmia. These different techniques can also help deduce whether a specific case of parosmia can be attributed to just one stimulating odor or if there is a group of stimulating odors that will generate the displaced smell. One case study performed by Frasnelli \"et al.\" offers a situation where certain smells, specifically coffees, cigarettes, onions, and perfumes, induced a \"nauseating\" odor for the patient, one which was artificial but unable to be aptly related to another known smell. In another case study cited in the same paper, one woman had parosmia in one nostril but not the other. Medical examinations and MRIs did not reveal any abnormalities; however the parosmia in this case was degenerative and only got worse with time. The authors do comment, however, that cases of parosmia can predict regeneration of olfactory senses.\n\nFor most patients afflicted with parosmia, symptoms usually decrease with time. Although there are instances of parosmia affecting patients for years at a time, this is certainly not the majority of cases. There have been experiments done to treat parosmia with L-Dopa, but besides that there are no current treatments other than inducing anosmia or hyposmia to the point where the odors are negligible.\n\n\n"}

The material was recorded, translated, and reworked by the exciseman and folklorist Alexander Carmichael (1832–1912).\n\n\"Carmina Gadelica\" was published in six volumes: Alexander Carmichael himself, with the assistance of family and friends, was responsible for the first two volumes, published in 1900; these were re-edited by his daughter Ella (1870–1928) in 1928. Although Carmichael's correspondence suggests that he planned at least one further volume in the series, he was unable to bring this plan to fruition. Further selections from Carmichael's manuscripts were edited by his grandson James Carmichael Watson (1910–1942) and published as volumes III (1940) and IV (1941). A fifth volume, mostly taken up with song texts, was edited by Professor Angus Matheson (1912–1962) in 1954. The series was rounded off in 1971 with a sixth volume containing a lengthy glossary and indices, edited by Angus Matheson with the assistance of his brother William (1910–1995). In 1992 Floris Press published a one-volume English-language edition with a valuable introduction by Dr John MacInnes (b. 1930). Floris would reprint the entire six-volume series in 2006.\n\nThe origins of the \"Carmina Gadelica\" can be traced to ‘Grazing and Agrestic Customs of the Outer Hebrides’, the second appendix Alexander Carmichael contributed to the \"Report\" of the Napier Commission in 1884. Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier, had requested Carmichael to compose a piece on traditional Hebridean land customs based on the chapter on the subject that he had written for the third volume of William Forbes Skene’s Celtic Scotland. Carmichael rounded off his contribution in an unorthodox manner, presenting a selection of traditional rhymes, prayers, blessings, and songs he had gathered from a wide variety of informants in the islands, intended to illustrate the spiritual refinement and respectability of their crofter reciters. The popularity of ‘Grazing and Agrestic Customs’, and a subsequent paper Carmichael delivered on 24 December 1888 to the Gaelic Society of Glasgow on ‘Uist Old Hymns’, encouraged him to embark upon a much more comprehensive work on the subject.\n\nThe collection was first offered, in 1891, to the Clarendon Press as \"Idylls of the Isles\", then subsequently to Archibald Sinclair's Gaelic publishing company in Glasgow. In both cases, the offer was withdrawn owing to Carmichael's unhappiness with the publisher's plans, and his determination to see the collection through the press on his own terms and according to his own design. Much of the final editing was carried out after Carmichael's retiral from the Inland Revenue in December 1897, with the help of a team of assistants including his daughter Ella Carmichael and his protégés George Henderson (1866–1912), who gave the work its title, and Kenneth MacLeod (1871–1955). The initial letters, adapted from early medieval insular manuscripts and engraved stones, were illustrated by Carmichael's wife Mary Frances Macbean (1838–1928). The book itself, dedicated to Mary Frances, was published in two volumes in October 1900, under the auspices of Walter Biggar Blaikie (1847–1928) in a limited edition of 300 copies, costing 3 guineas a copy. \"Carmina Gadelica\" was a landmark in Scottish art publishing, intended not just as a treasury of lore, but as an object of beauty in itself.\n\nThe first two volumes of \"Carmina Gadelica\" were initially welcomed by reviewers as a monumental achievement in folklore, as well as a lasting testament to their creator: the ‘splendid consummation of the love-labour of a whole diligent life-time’. Although little public criticism was voiced during Carmichael's lifetime, it is clear that other Gaelic folklore collectors and scholars such as Father Allan McDonald, the Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, and Alexander Macbain were uneasy with his earlier treatment of material he had collected. Eventually, Carmichael's editing methods were roundly challenged in 1976 with the publication of Hamish Robertson's article in \"Scottish Gaelic Studies\", \"Studies in Carmichael's \"Carmina Gadelica\"\". Having searched for manuscript copies of charms appearing in the third and fourth volumes, Robertson accused Carmichael of meddling with, altering, and polishing original texts: 'hardly one had not been touched up in some way, sometimes quite drastically'. Robertson's article drew a vigorous rebuff from the Gaelic scholar John Lorne Campbell in the following issue of the journal, although Campbell conceded that '[m]uch of the first three volumes of the \"Carmina\" must be taken as a literary and not as a literal presentation of Gaelic folklore'. Now that Alexander Carmichael's original field notebooks, accompanied by full transcriptions, have been published online under the auspices of the Carmichael Watson Project at the Centre for Research Collections, University of Edinburgh, for the first time the editing processes involved in the creation of \"Carmina Gadelica\" can properly be assessed.\n\nAlthough \"Carmina Gadelica\" remains a controversial text, its volumes have to be read in the context of Carmichael's own times, a period of widespread political strife in the Highlands, when habitual contempt of Gaels, their language and their culture was widespread and publicly expressed. In the words of Gaelic scholar Dr John MacInnes, \"Carmina Gadelica\" is not a monumental exercise in literary fabrication nor, on the other hand, is it a transcript of ancient poems and spells reproduced exactly in the form in which they survived in oral tradition.' Despite its flaws, \"Carmina Gadelica\" remains an indispensable source for the popular culture, customs, beliefs, and way of life of Scottish Gaels in the nineteenth century.\n\n"}

It is applied widely throughout the country and has gained popularity over time, dating from the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe stereotypical image formed as a variation of the dumb blonde/bimbo persona, with references to the Estuary English accent, white stiletto heels, mini skirts, silicone-augmented breasts, peroxide blonde hair, over-indulgent use of fake tan (lending an orange appearance), promiscuity, loud verbal vulgarity and socialising at downmarket nightclubs.\n\n\"Time\" magazine recorded:\n\nIn 2004, Bob Russell, Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester in Essex, appealed for debate in the House of Commons on the issue, encouraging a boycott of \"The People\" tabloid, which has printed several derogatory references to girls from Essex.\n\nThe Essex Women’s Advisory Group was set up in 2010 to combat the negative stereotyping of girls living in Essex by supporting Essex-based women's charities helping those in need as well as by funding projects that promote women and girl's learning and success in science, technology, the arts, sports and business. The charitable fund is administered by the Essex Community Foundation.\n\nOn 6 October 2016, Juliet Thomas and Natasha Sawkins of The Mother Hub launched a campaign on social media to draw attention to the negative definition of Essex girl in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and \"Collins Dictionary\". Their main goal was to raise awareness and to open a dialogue around the derogatory \"Essex girl\" stereotype. Their campaign centred around changing the definition of \"Essex girl\" to \"a girl from or living in Essex\" by encouraging women to use the hashtag #IAmAnEssexGirl and included a petition to change or remove the dictionary definitions.

{"id": "1914875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914875", "title": "The Hollywood Blonds", "text": "The Hollywood Blonds\n\nThe Hollywood Blonds is a name used by several professional wrestling tag teams over the years.\n\nThe original Blonds were Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown who used the name in the 1970s. Rip Rogers and Ted Oates wrestled as The Hollywood Blonds in the mid-1980s in the National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). The name was also adopted by \"Pretty Boy\" Larry Sharpe and \"Dynamite\" Jack Evans, who had a stint in then World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The most well known team to use the \"Hollywood Blonds\" moniker was \"Stunning\" Steve Austin and \"Flyin\" Brian Pillman who used the name as a heel tag team in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992 and 1993 and is often mentioned when talking about great tag teams.\n\nThe team of Buddy Roberts (billed as \"Dale Roberts\") and Jerry Brown were the first to adopt the name \"The Hollywood Blonds\" in wrestling when they began teaming together in 1970 in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Tri-State territory (NWA Tri State promoted in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi).\n\nThe two quickly became one of the top heel acts in the territory with their \"Hollywood superstar\" arrogance and cheating ways. On May 8, 1970, the Blonds won their first title when they won a tournament to crown new NWA United States Tag Team Champions (Tri State version). Their first run with the title was short as Luke Brown and Danny Hodge defeated them three weeks later, but the Blonds managed to regain the gold days after being defeated for them. For the rest of 1970, Roberts and Brown dominated the Tri State tag team scene until losing to Bill Watts and Billy Red Lyons in January 1971. In early 1973, the Blonds became three-time NWA United States Tag Team Champions by defeating Dennis Stamp and Bull Bullinski for the titles. The Blonds held on to the titles until sometime April, when they lost the gold to Rip Tyler and Eddie Sullivan before leaving the promotion by mid-1973.\n\nAfter leaving the Tri State area, Roberts and Brown next popped up in Florida working for Eddie Graham’s Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF). After working their way up the ranks, the duo challenged for and won the top tag team title in the promotion, the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, from the team of Dick Slater and Stan Vachon in March 1974. The Blonds ruled the tag team division over the summer of 1974 until dropping the gold to Dick Slater and Toru Tanaka in the fall (either September or October). After their run with the titles ended, the Blonds moved on to another territory, the most natural territory for the team – NWA Hollywood Wrestling in Los Angeles. The Gene and Mike LeBell territory saw Roberts and Brown win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship four times between December 1974 and August 1975, defeating such teams as Victor Rivera and Louie Tillet, Porkchop Cash and S.D. Jones, John Tolos and Louis Tillet, and the promotion's biggest tag-team attraction Black Gorman and Goliath. During their time in Los Angeles, the Hollywood Blonds were also involved in an angle that saw the Los Angeles version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship shift over to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) as their main tag team title of that day. On August 1, 1975, reigning champions Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi fought the Hollywood Blonds to a no contest, after which the titles were declared vacant. A rematch in Nagoya, Japan saw the Blonds win the North American Tag Team titles on September 22. On October 2, Inoki and Sakaguchi regained the titles and they became more or less exclusive to NJPW after that date.\n\nWhen the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended near the end of 1975, they returned to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine and Gorgeous George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds’ time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title to Buck Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett’s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim Woods for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid-Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks right off the bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25. The Blonds lost the titles to Norvell Austin and Pat Barrett on August 15. After holding the titles two more times, the team lost them for good to Austin and Barrett on September 25, 1977.\n\nShortly after losing the Southern Tag Team titles, Brown and Roberts split up, with Roberts going on to form The Fabulous Freebirds with Terry Gordy and Michael Hayes while Brown kept working as a singles wrestler mainly in the south.\n\nIn 1984, Rip Rogers and Ted Oates adopted the Hollywood Blonds moniker and \"Superstar\" gimmick for a run in the NWA's Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory. Rogers had previously teamed up with Gary Royal and Pez Whatley in a Hollywood Blonds inspired team known as The Convertible Blondes in Angelo Poffo’s International Championship Wrestling (ICW).\n\nThe arrogant heel team defeated Ron Garvin and Oates' storyline brother, Jerry, to win the NWA National Tag Team Championship on September 20, 1984. Rogers and Oates held on to the titles for a little over a month. They lost the titles to The Lightning Express (Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner) on November 1. Not long after losing the titles, Rogers and Oats split up when Rip Rogers left the area to pursue a singles career.\n\nFrom August till October 1984, Dusty Wolfe and Ken Timbs formed The Hollywood Blondes in Florida, with little success.\n\nThe version of The Hollywood Blonds with the greatest exposure worldwide was the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) incarnation consisting of \"Stunning\" Steve Austin and \"Flyin'\" Brian Pillman. Steve Austin and Brian Pillman teamed for the first time in of October 17, 1992 and battled to a draw with Shane Douglas and Brad Armstrong. Austin and Pillman also teamed against and Scott Steiner and Marcus Alexander Bagwell, jobber tag team Chris Sullivan and Tommy Angel, Dustin Rhodes and Brad Armstrong (who was filling in for Barry Windham), Ricky Steamboat and Nikita Koloff, and Steamboat and Douglas. Austin and Pillman temporarily stopped teaming when in late 1992, when the recently heel turned Brian Pillman started teaming with Barry Windham, but when Windham was groomed for a singles push and a run with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and after one last unsuccessful attempt at winning the WCW/NWA World Tag Team Championship from Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas at Starrcade 1992, Pillman and Windham stopped teaming. Windham declared his intention to pursue the NWA world title, and told Pillman he should instead team with Austin. However, the real reason for the team's reunion was that the WCW bookers didn’t have any other immediate plans for Austin.\n\nAt first, the two were just billed as \"Stunning\" Steve and \"Flyin'\" Brian, but the two (with input from Scotty \"Flamingo\" Levy) came up with the idea of The Hollywood Blonds, complete with matching trunks and vests. The duo was immediately thrust into a feud with Shane Douglas and Ricky Steamboat over the NWA and WCW World Tag Team titles, which gave the duo a chance to show off their teamwork and their trademark \"mock filming\" pose that they invented. After a successful move, one of the Blonds would move his hands like he was turning the handle on an old film camera. After winning a match, Pillman or Austin would arrogantly state that \"Your brush with greatness is over\" to further annoy the fans.\n\nOn the March 27, 1993 episode of \"Power Hour\", Austin and Pillman defeated Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas to win their only NWA/WCW World Tag Team Championship. Though Steamboat and Douglas had several rematches, they were unable to recapture the titles. On one night, Austin and Pillman faced an unknown masked team known as \"Dos Hombres\" (literally \"two guys\") who they assumed were a couple of luchadores from Mexico. The match started out rather inconspicuously, until the two masked men started showing moves more consistent with Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas than two luchadores. Dos Hombres won the match, earning them a shot at the titles at Slamboree. However, by the time Slamboree came about, Douglas had been fired by WCW and Steamboat was without a partner. Instead of canceling the already announced steel cage match, Tom Zenk was made to wear the mask of \"Hombre Uno\" and work the match without anyone realizing it wasn’t Douglas under the red and green hood. The Blonds won at Slamboree, thus ending the \"Dos Hombres\" angle.\n\nAfter the feud with Steamboat and Douglas ended, the Blonds were programmed with the recently reformed Four Horsemen, who at the time consisted of Ric Flair, Paul Roma, and Ole and Arn Anderson. Flair had recently returned from a run with then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and been given a talk show segment called \"\"A Flair for the Gold\"\" to give Flair television time before his WWF release allowed him to wrestle for WCW. Pillman and Austin appeared on the show and mocked Flair and Anderson's age. Several weeks later, the Blonds continued their antagonism of Flair and Anderson by mocking them through their own segment called \"\"A Flare for the Old\"\". Austin would stand in the background with a pillow under his shirt for a gut while slowly stroking his chin imitating Arn Anderson. Pillman dressed up in an old bathrobe, put on reading glasses and a grey wig and then cut into Flair for being too old and too scared of the Hollywood Blonds. The impersonation drew Ric Flair back in the ring at \"Clash of the Champions XXIII\", where Flair and Anderson challenged the Blonds for the tag team titles. Despite winning the two out of three falls match, they did not win the titles since the Blonds were disqualified after Barry Windham interfered.\n\nWindham's attack shifted Flair's focus away from the Hollywood Blonds, which in turn meant that Arn Anderson needed a new tag team partner. Not long after the Clash, Paul Roma was introduced as the fourth Horseman and would team with Anderson in the Horsemen/Blonds feud. On July 18, at Beach Blast, Roma and Anderson were beaten by the Blonds, who cheated to retain their titles. Not long after Beach Blast, Pillman injured his ankle and was unable to compete at a scheduled title match at \"Clash of the Champions XXIV\". However, due to WCW taping policies, Arn Anderson and Paul Roma had already been taped as the World Tag Team Champions so the title change had to happen despite Pillman being injured. Austin teamed with \"Lord\" Steven Regal at the Clash where they dropped the titles to Roma and Anderson.\n\nAs soon as the Blonds dropped the titles, the team was again temporarily split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and jobber tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. The Blonds also confronted The Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. The Blonds last match as a team took place on the October 30, 1993 episode of \"Saturday Night\". After the Blonds had defeated a jobber tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker snubbing him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he would put him down. Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and breaking up the Hollywood Blonds for the third and final time.\n\nThe Austin/Pillman feud was never pushed intensely and at times played more for comedy than emotion, a fact underscored by Pillman being more interested in putting Parker in a chicken suit than getting back at Austin.\n\nThey would briefly reunite in the WWF in 1996, but not as the Blonds. Austin by then was using his new \"Stone Cold\" persona, and an injured Pillman was \"The Loose Cannon\" and acted primarily as his sidekick, until Austin turned on Pillman for showing his admiration for Austin's nemesis, Bret Hart.\n\nAccording to WrestlingData.com, a compiler of available win-loss records, The Hollywood Blonds are perfectly balanced at 52-52, with 8 draws.\n\nIn 1999, Lenny Lane and Lodi used the name The West Hollywood Blondes as a play off the old name.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The following year, Cundari and Zanni formed Memory Records and re-released \"Chinese Revenge\". The single proved to be very popular in Italy, selling over 10,000 copies. It also proved to be a minor hit in Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the success of \"Chinese Revenge\", they began writing songs for other bands, including Baby's Gang (\"Happy Song\", \"Challenger\"), and helped fellow Italian band \"Hipnosis\" cover Vangelis' song \"Pulstar\". It was released in 1983, going Top 10 in Germany and Top 20 in Switzerland. The same year, Maiola and Cundari released another single \"Japanese War Game\", under the Koto name, which became another hit.\n\nIn 1985, Koto released \"Visitors\". In an interview with Maiola, he confirmed it was his favourite Koto song. The track contains a sample from Michael Jackson's 1984 hit \"Thriller\". The following year, he released another single, titled \"Jabdah\". Fueled by a music video, the song became a big hit, charting in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Around this time, critics coined the term \"spacesynth\", which combines elements of Italo disco and Space disco. \"Visitors\" and \"Jabdah\" are considered part of the genre. In 1987, a megamix was released, combining elements of their previous four singles.\n\nIn 1990 house and techno music was becoming popular, and Italo disco begun to decline in popularity. Nevertheless, Koto released another single, \"Dragon's Legend\". Containing samples from the 1983 video game \"Dragon's Lair\", the song proved a minor hit in the Netherlands, peaking at No. 20. By now, Memory Records began running into financial problems. In 1989, they remixed their debut single, \"Chinese Revenge\", for a more dance flavour and Maiola composed his next single under the Koto name, the house-flavoured, \"Champion's Cue\". The song was not as popular as their previous singles, as Memory Records began releasing Techno and House music records. This did not prove a success, and the label went broke.\n\nThe rights to Memory Records were acquired by ZYX Music. They asked Dutch composer Michiel van der Kuy (of the spacesynth band Laserdance, best known for their 1986 hit single \"Humanoid Invasion\") to follow the steps of Maiola and Cundari. In 1989, he presented the first full-length Koto album \"Masterpieces\", containing remakes of previous Koto songs, and his own compositions, including \"Time\", \"Minoan War\" and \"Plain\". In the following years, he released more singles, including \"Acknowledge\" (1990), \"Mechanic Sense\" (1992) and \"Mind Machine\" (1992), the main melody of which was clearly inspired by the song \"Disco Maniac\" by Baby's Gang.\n\nIn 1992, Michiel van der Kuy published another Koto album, \"From the Dawn of Time\", composed entirely by himself. He also released two cover albums in 1990 and 1993. After this, Koto fell silent. During this period, it was revealed that Stefano Cundari had died from cancer in 1990.\n\nIn 2001, Maiola bought back the rights to the Koto name, and has released three more singles under that alias. He is now working with Roberto Bisca and Alex Cundari to compose new songs. Their first five singles are included on many Italo disco and '80s compilations and retrospectives.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In his thirties and with a slightly fussy, nervous edge to him, Bowden is intelligent and, at times, quite sly and cunning. He was responsible for thwarting the plans of Jack Schitt and the Goliath Corporation when he substituted a copy of Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven\" in place of the weapons manual that Schitt thought he was accessing. He shares his name with the braking cable on bicycles. Another character is called Sturmey Archer, also a manufacturer of bicycle gears.\n\nHugely intelligent and equally immoral (believes in doing what is morally evil, as opposed to amorality, which would mean not believing in a moral good or evil), Acheron Hades started out as a lecturer in English, teaching, among others, Thursday Next, before he turned to a life of crime. Believed by some to be only half-human, the other half being allegedly demonic or vampiric in nature (he casts no shadow), Acheron possesses a number of mysterious powers (as, indeed, do most of his siblings). He cannot be photographed or recorded in any way, and has shown the ability to know when his name is uttered within a considerable distance (a radius of 1000 yards, and possible further), hence his name is not often spoken aloud (compare Lord Voldemort, or The Chandrian). He has shown an immunity to the effects of most weapons, his only confirmed vulnerability being to silver. Said to have the ability to \"lie in thought, word, action and appearance\" he also possesses formidable powers of deception, including the ability to assume the shape of others and hypnotic persuasive abilities on the \"weaker minded\" (he is unable to hypnotise Thursday). Another ability that possibly follows in this vein is his ability to pass through glass barriers by making the glass soft and pliable through heated touch; after he withdraws his hand the glass reverts to its original state, the only sign of his trespass being the slightly mottled surface of the glass where his hand passed through (shown when Thursday examines the empty Chuzzlewit glass security casing). He appears to possess great strength, at one point easily smashing his way through a wall, although inertia still has an effect on him. Time does not seem to have a proper hold on him either, as when it is stopped around him by Colonel Next, he remains unaffected (this might possibly be why he does not seem to age). He is either very good at guessing or possesses some form of telepathy as he can figure out the personality faults and mental weaknesses of a person within moments.\n\nHades appears as the principal villain of \"The Eyre Affair\". He kidnaps Mycroft Next and steals his Prose Portal, using it to enter stolen original manuscripts of such classic tales as \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" and \"Jane Eyre\", with the aim of extracting characters from them and holding them to ransom. When Thursday rescued the extracted Jane Eyre, Hades escaped into the book, pursued by Thursday. Ultimately, they confronted each other in Thornfield Hall, where Thursday was finally able to eliminate her opponent once and for all.\n\nAcheron is the eldest child of the Hades Family, which is apparently evil as a whole (only one member is mentioned as not really being evil, Lethe, the apparent \"white sheep\" of the family; another brother, Styx Hades, is shown to be more of a nuisance than really evil, committing pranks and not possessing any actual powers). It is also implied that they have been evil for generations; as Acheron's sister Aornis puts it, \"No member of the Hades family has been captured alive for eighty-eight generations.\"\n\nHades has made the occasional appearance in the later books, showing up within Thursday's memories.\n\nBoth 'Acheron' and 'Hades' refer to places in the mythical Greek underworld, as do 'Styx' and 'Lethe'.\n\nHicks is in charge of several divisions of SpecOps in Swindon, including the Literary Detectives to whom Thursday transfers. He is perpetually concerned with the budget and seemingly nothing else. He allows Jack Schitt to have his way at first and seemingly faces up poorly to higher authority, but in \"Something Rotten\" he invents an elaborate cover story for Thursday after her return. He is often practising his putting in his office and coaxes Thursday to join him for a round of golf; she accepts out of gratitude for his alibi. Hicks has several grown children and by \"Something Rotten\" is planning to retire shortly. The name is an allusion to Braxton Hicks contractions near the end of pregnancy.\n\nA Japanese literary tourist and member of JurisFiction. In \"Lost in a Good Book\", she gives Thursday the tools to become a JurisFiction agent herself. After her husband retires, the couple moved into Thornfield Hall in the novel \"Jane Eyre\", where they manage the house, carefully avoiding any appearances in the narrative.\n\nBrother to Thursday and Joffy Next and best friend of Landen Parke-Laine. He fought in the Crimean War and died there during a disastrous battle which occurred after he accidentally sent his unit off in the wrong direction (this mimics the role of Captain Louis Nolan in the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854; Anton directs the Light Armoured Brigade into the teeth of the Russian artillery). After much agonising over whether to tell the truth, Landen finally gave evidence to the inquest about Anton's error, which drove a wedge between him and Thursday, until the two reconciled during the events of \"The Eyre Afair\".\n\nThursday's father and ex-member of SO-12, the ChronoGuard. Went rogue, leading the ChronoGuard to delete him from history by interrupting his conception; however, due to his skills at time manipulation, still exists and drops in on his family from time to time to assist or pass on advice. By the events of \"Something Rotten\", he has rejoined the ChronoGuard, albeit in a reduced capacity. In the end of \"First Among Sequels\", he's reactualised.\n\nBrother of Thursday and Anton Next. He is a minister for the Global Standard Deity, which aims to represent all of the others equally and without prejudice, with the laudable aim of attempting to prevent religious conflict. Cheerful, frequently irreverent almost but (usually) not quite to the point of being irritating and laid-back, he nevertheless has an extremely caring nature and a great deal of wisdom, which serves him well in his chosen vocation. He generally calls Thursday 'Doofus' and used to slap her on the back of the head on a daily basis until she broke his nose to get him to stop, but the two are very close. As of \"Lost in a Good Book\" he is in a relationship with Miles Hawke, an operative with SpecOps-14.\n\nThursday's uncle and husband of Polly. Mycroft is an inventor of strange and unusual devices of varying degrees of use. Some have proved to be important plot devices throughout the series, such as his Prose Portal, which allowed real-world individuals to enter books and the Ovinator, which encourages cooperation. Others, such as his device for erasing memories (which he has no recollection of ever inventing) serve purely as running gags. He has been hunted by the Goliath Corporation, who wished to use his Prose Portal to retrieve fictional weaponry from the Bookworld to sell in the real world. He retired into the Bookworld, living within the Sherlock Holmes series of books, where he occasionally interfered with the narrative, appearing as Holmes' brother. By the time of \"Something Rotten\" he and Polly had returned safely to the real world, having used the memory erasure device to ensure that they were of no use to Goliath.\n\nA brilliant mathematician, Thursday's aunt, and wife of Mycroft. She generally serves as Mycroft's assistant, as she possesses far more common sense than her husband. She was temporarily held hostage within the William Wordsworth poem \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" by Acheron Hades during the events of \"The Eyre Affair\". Enjoys tormenting door-to-door salesmen along with Thursday's mother.\n\nMother to Thursday Next and her brothers. She used to work for SpecOps 3 (and claims to still do so on occasion), but has now become something of a homebody, and is generally found there throughout the novels. She loves her husband, despite his eradication, but has occasional suspicions about his fidelity, particularly regarding his dealings with Lady Emma Hamilton. She herself is not immune to other men, it transpires, as she develops an apparent interest in Otto Bismarck when he stays with her for a few days. On the other hand, having no official husband, she is believed by most to have conceived three children outside of wedlock, something that affects her social life.\n\nThursday's husband, Landen is an award-winning novelist whose books include \"Bad Sofa\", \"Memoirs of A Crimean Veteran\" and \"Once Were Scoundrels\". He served as an officer in the Crimean War (still raging in Fforde's alternate 1985), during which he came into contact with Thursday, with whom he fell in love, and her brother Anton, who became his best friend. During the disastrous battle which became known as the \"Charge of the Light-Armoured Brigade\", Anton was killed and Landen lost a leg. During the subsequent inquest, Landen, after much agonizing, admitted that Anton had made an error that had led to the destruction of their unit. As a result, Thursday left him and refused to speak to him for ten years. They came back into contact during the events of \"The Eyre Affair\", during which Thursday was finally able to forgive Landen and agreed to marry him. Despite his missing leg, he is relied upon in dangerous situations.\n\nDuring the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\", Landen is eradicated from history by a rogue member of the Chronoguard, acting on behalf of the Goliath Corporation, who wish to blackmail Thursday into returning their operative Jack Schitt. He then appears only in Thursday's memories until reactualised during \"Something Rotten\".\n\nHis name is one of Fforde's trademark puns: in the British edition of the board game Monopoly, Park Lane is the second-to-last street on the board and consequently one of the most expensive. As additions to this pun, Landen's late father is named Billden Parke-Laine and his mother is named Houson Parke-Laine.\n\nThursday's pet dodo, brought to life by genetic engineering. Originally she was believed to be male, but revealed to be female during the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\", when she lays an egg. This ultimately hatches, producing her son, Alan. The name is a reference to Dickens's \"Pickwick Papers\".\n\nHead of the Goliath Corporation's internal security service and their Advanced Weapons Division, and thus a man of great power. He showed great interest in Mycroft Next's Prose Portal, hoping to use it to retrieve fictional weaponry, having utterly failed to make the equivalent weapon work in the real world, to the extent that he was willing to work with the criminal Acheron Hades in order to gain access. Once Hades was defeated within \"Jane Eyre\", Schitt used the Prose Portal to enter what he thought was the manual for the plasma rifle that he wanted to retrieve, only to discover that Bowden Cable had slipped a copy of \"The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe inside the manual's dust cover instead. The Portal closed behind him, trapping him there.\n\nHe was ultimately retrieved by Thursday during the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\", after Goliath arranged to have her husband Landen eradicated from history by the Chronoguard in order to blackmail her. She cooperated, only to find herself double-crossed. Schitt, however, never returned to his original position in the corporation; when next seen, during the events of \"Something Rotten\", he has been demoted to a far lesser role within Goliath and makes only a brief appearance.\n\nHis name is a pun on 'jack shit', meaning 'nothing'.\n\nA member of SpecOps 12, the ChronoGuard, Filbert dated Thursday until he experienced a mishap in the timestream and was too embarrassed to tell her. Thursday runs into him again while both are working for SpecOps 5 in pursuit of Acheron Hades. When introduced to \"Snood,\" Thursday assumes he is his father and doesn't discover his true identity until he is killed by Hades.\n\nSpike works for SO-17 and is the sole agent for that department assigned to the Reading area. He deals with undead paranormals and the capturing of Supreme Evil Beings, and occasionally enlists Thursday Next to assist with his work in exchange for money. Later in the series, he marries a woman named Cindy, who he believes to be a librarian, but is in fact an assassin. \"Stoker\" is a reference to Bram Stoker, author of \"Dracula\"; \"Spike\" may be a reference to the shape of the wooden stakes that he uses in his line of work.\n\nSpike is almost on his own against the forces of darkness, yet is arguably the cheeriest person seen in the books: he is jocular, easy-going and is rarely serious or distressed in his work. He loses his cool only rarely; and although he once, seemingly in a fit of depression, considered the possibility of self-sacrifice/suicide, admitting that \"battling the undead was never a bowl of cherries,\" he was in fact trying to trick both Thursday and a Supreme Evil Being. In \"Something Rotten\" he offers to take Thursday's place in the afterworld when she is about to die, now knowing that his wife is an assassin, but Thursday persuades him to stay for the sake of their daughter Betty. Ultimately, his wife gives \"her\" life to save Thursday. He is described as a tall, muscular man with blond dreadlocks and sunglasses. It was once hinted that he suffers from either lycanthropy or vampirism and requires regular \"medication\"; without it he will sometimes lose control of himself and exhibit wolflike behavior, such as eating live mice.\n\nOther members of staff at the Swindon branch of SO-27, appear from time to time and are notable chiefly because their names are puns on Sea Areas known to UK radio listeners from the Shipping Forecast on BBC Radio 4. These characters include Jim Crometty (named after the Sea Area 'Cromarty'); Sergeant Ross ('Ross'); Finisterre ('Finisterre', which was renamed 'FitzRoy' in 2002); Fisher ('Fisher'); Helmut Bight ('German Bight'); Malin ('Malin'); Sole ('Sole'); and the Forty brothers, Jeff and Geoff ('Forties'). Strictly speaking, Crometty does not appear in the book - having been murdered and replaced in the Swindon LiteraTecs team by Thursday.\n\nDr. Runcible Spoon (Professor of English Literature at Swindon University) is named after the utensil with which The Owl and the Pussycat dine on \"mince and slices of quince\" in a nonsense rhyme by Edward Lear.\n\nDetective Inspector Oswald Mandias of Yorkshire CID (the policeman investigating the theft of the Jane Eyre manuscript from the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth) is named after Ozymandias, the eponymous subject of Shelley's 1818 sonnet.\n\nThe head of JurisFiction. During the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\" and \"The Well of Lost Plots\", this position is filled by an unnamed individual who is only ever referred to by his title. He was murdered in the latter, by Libris, weeks from retirement, and replaced by an obedient clone of himself. Following the successful intervention of The Great Panjandrum, the clone was demoted, and Thursday was then asked to assume the role, which she accepted, holding the position for around two years before resigning during the events of \"Something Rotten\". The Bellman is hinted to be the lead character in Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark\". He urges the PROs to \"be careful out there\", quoting the roll-call sergeant from \"Hill Street Blues\".\n\nDue to boundary changes (a reference to the Local Government Commissions) the Cheshire Cat is now technically referred to as the Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat, but still generally known by his original appellation. He serves as an über-librarian to the Grand Library, as well as a high-ranking JurisFiction official. His work is especially significant in \"Something Rotten\", where after years of searching he finds Yorrick Kaine's origin—a self-published novel not even in the Library—and engages Kaine in a Merlin-versus-Madame Mim-esque battle of summoning literary warriors, eventually calling upon the Blue Fairy from \"Pinocchio\" to turn Kaine into a real person.\n\nResident cad within Daphne Farquitt's \"The Squire of High Potternews\", Deane is an accomplished JurisFiction agent who in reality is nothing like his character in his novel. He is a potential target in \"The Well of Lost Plots\" along with Perkins and Havisham, but his disappearance makes him a suspect instead. He is revealed to have been hiding for his own safety with the serving girl he ravishes, with whom he is actually in love. They and Quasimodo help Thursday foil Harris Tweed and his cohorts, and \"Potternews\" is finally granted an Internal Plot Readjustment to allow Vernham and his lover to marry happily. His name presumably derives from the Hampshire village of Vernham Dean.\n\nA reclusive septuagenarian author of trashy romances, Farquitt began writing in the 1930s and has little real variation in plot between her novels. Vernham Deane is one of her characters. Because she is the author of the vanity-published \"At Long Last Lust\", origin of Yorrick Kaine, Kaine starts a campaign against all things Danish in an attempt to destroy every remaining copy of his book (Farquitt having been born in Copenhagen) so he cannot be deleted from within. Hamlet claims to have brought her and tens of thousands of her fans to the Superhoop to stop Kaine's interference, but in reality it was only nine fans and Farquitt remains as elusive as ever.\n\nCordelia is an attractive senior SpecOps agent who works in Public Relations. She spends the whole of \"Lost in a Good Book\" persistently trying to get Thursday to do press interviews regarding the alterations made to the storyline of \"Jane Eyre\" during the events of \"The Eyre Affair\".\n\nThe younger sister of Acheron Hades, who appeared as a villain in \"Lost in a Good Book\". Aornis Hades is a mnemonomorph, a person who can alter memories at will; she can also apparently alter entropy, a concept of science. The general law of entropy, as presented in the book, states that reactions can only become more chaotic; a plate can fall to the ground and shatter, but it cannot reassemble. Aornis lowers entropy, causing extremely large-scale and bizarre coincidences to occur. She held the world to ransom in \"Lost\", giving Thursday the ultimatum that she would stop her plan if Thursday takes her own life. With her plan thwarted at the last minute by the intervention of Colonel Next, Aornis escaped. In \"First Among Sequels\", she is seen imprisoned by the Chronoguard, in a time-loop inside the T.K. Maxx department store.\n\nA mental copy of Aornis, embedded in Thursday's memories, made several appearances during the events of \"The Well of Lost Plots\", often interacting with other 'personas' as recalled by Next. This copy was capable of altering Thursday's memories to suit her own purposes, but was finally defeated when she summoned Thursday's worst memory, which turned out to be a childhood nightmare. The Aornis copy was unable to control it and it destroyed her, and Thursday was left with the reassurance that defeating the real Aornis would now be easy.\n\nThursday claims that Aornis's name is derived from the fact that the Acheron, Lethe, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Aornis rivers are all tributaries to the river Styx. However, in canonical descriptions of the underworld, there is no river by the name Aornis, nor are the other rivers tributary to the Styx- however they do all flow through the Greek Underworld and separate its different regions.\n\nMiss Havisham is a member of the JurisFiction originating in the novel \"Great Expectations\" by Charles Dickens. She was assigned as Thursday Next's mentor when the younger woman first joined JurisFiction and tutored her through her examinations to become a fully fledged agent. A highly respected member of JurisFiction and one of their best operatives, her hobbies included driving powerful cars at terrifyingly high speeds. This hobby was eventually used against her during the events of \"The Well of Lost Plots\", when a car she was driving was sabotaged, causing her to crash. Badly burned, she returned to her novel, where she and Pip staged her death within the novel. She is replaced by a generic understudy, which is understood by all to be 'not the same'.\n\nYorrick Kaine is a fictional character, originating in a highly limited self-published early novel by the author Daphne Farquitt. Kaine became a 'pagerunner', a character who escapes his or her own book and ultimately left the Bookworld altogether for the real world, where he ran for high political office during the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\", only to be thwarted by Thursday and JurisFiction.\n\nBy the events of \"Something Rotten\", Kaine had advanced to the office of Chancellor, making him the second most powerful man in the land. He was using Mycroft Next's invention, the Ovinator, to manipulate Parliament into doing what he wanted. During the events of that novel, where he was made real and ultimately lost the Ovinator, he was removed from power. \"First Among Sequels\" reveals he has been arrested and imprisoned.\n\nMember of the ChronoGuard and former partner of Colonel Next. Appears briefly at the end of \"Eyre Affair\", questioning Thursday about her father. He plays a much larger role in \"Lost in a Good Book\", where he is hired by Goliath to eradicate Landen Parke-Laine. He holds a strong grudge against Thursday Next, and refuses to honor his part of the deal between her and Goliath as revenge for \"what she did to him.\" This action has yet to occur in Thursday's timeline.\n\nAlways clad in blue gingham, 108-year-old Gran Next claims not to be able to die until she's read the ten most boring classics. She helps Thursday realize her bookjumping abilities by having her read \"The Flopsy Bunnies\" aloud over and over. In \"The Well of Lost Plots\" she comes to stay with Thursday in \"Caversham Heights\" and helps her to remember Landen and defeat Aornis's mindworm, assuring her that the real Aornis will be much easier.\n\nGran's identity comes into question later on when Thursday realizes that both her grandmothers are long dead and she's only known Gran Next for about three years. Finally when Thursday is sentenced for her \"Jane Eyre\" fiction infraction—twenty years in blue gingham and having to read the ten most boring classics before she can die—she realizes that Gran is herself seventy years in the future. As friends and yet-unborn family members gather, Thursday reads the last paragraph of \"The Faerie Queene\" to Gran, who dies peacefully.\n\nGran's long life includes many interesting jobs, such as working in many different divisions of SpecOps, spending twenty-four hours as a man and ruling as God Emperor of the Universe.\n\nDavid \"Pinky\" Perkins and Akrid Snell were the lead characters in a set of detective novels and both worked as JurisFiction agents.\n\nPerkins headed up the Grammasite Research facility, in a land appropriated from an unpublished fantasy novel (\"The Sword of the Zenobians\"), which is populated by many fictional creatures who were unable to live safely within their own novels. He was slain when the Minotaur, held captive within the fantasy, was deliberately released to kill him.\n\nSnell worked as the lawyer for JurisFiction. He is the first to contact Thursday by Footnoterphone in \"Lost in a Good Book\", and as head of the JurisFiction legal team defends her at her first hearing in Franz Kafka's \"The Trial\". When contact was lost with Perkins, he, accompanied by Thursday Next, Miss Havisham and Commander Bradshaw, entered the research facility to investigate. When a sample of the misspelling vyrus was released within Perkin's laboratory, Snell stayed behind to attempt to deal with it. He died from his injuries shortly afterwards.\n\nA senior Goliath employee and half-brother of Jack Schitt. Schitt-Hawse is primarily responsible for the eradication from history of Landen Parke-Laine during the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\", in order to blackmail Thursday into retrieving Jack Schitt from inside Poe's \"The Raven\". Thursday agreed to retrieve Schitt, only for Schitt-Hawse to subsequently imprison her, intending to study her bookjumping ability in order to open up new potential markets for the Goliath Corporation within fiction. Thursday was able to escape with the assistance of Miss Havisham and went to live in the Bookworld in order to hide from Goliath.\n\nSchitt-Hawse reappeared briefly in \"Something Rotten\", when Thursday visited the CEO of the Goliath Corporation during a board meeting.\n\nHe is almost invariably accompanied by his henchmen, Mr. Chalk and Mr. Cheese, although by the time of \"Something Rotten\" Cheese has been reassigned to work at a Goliath-owned café.\n\nHis name is a homonym of 'brick shithouse', from the phrase 'built like a brick shithouse'.\n\nBartholomew Stiggins is a Neanderthal and head of the Swindon branch of SpecOps-13. He helped Thursday out during the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\" when she has a run-in, engineered by Aornis Hades, with another Neanderthal. He reappears during \"Something Rotten\", when he accompanies her to the old Goliath laboratory facilities in the hope of finding information that would allow his race to breed successfully, something that was left out when their race was brought back to life through genetic engineering. In return for Thursday's assistance, Stiggins helps her win a critical croquet game by providing a number of Neanderthal players to fill gaps on the team. His name is a reference to Stig of the Dump.\n\nCindy is a professional assassin known as the Windowmaker (the first use of that name was due to a typographical error in a newspaper) who has finished off sixty-seven people (sixty-eight if you count Samuel Pring, but she later admits that was a fluke). In \"Something Rotten\" she has a contract to exterminate Thursday. Cindy is aware that Thursday knows she is an assassin, while Thursday knows Cindy wants to kill her. Spike is oblivious to both of these facts, and is happily married to her. After she is hit on the head by a falling piano stool she offers to replace a dying Thursday on her way to the afterlife, knowing she will never leave prison if she survives or be with Spike or their daughter again, and making up partly for her crimes.\n\nA JurisFiction agent from the real world. He is revealed as being a villain towards the end of \"The Well of Lost Plots\". As a result of his actions, Tweed was banished from the Bookworld and now lives in Swindon. His name is a pun on both a type of rugged woollen cloth called Harris Tweed, and on the \"Eagle\" comics' similar character, Harris Tweed.\n\nWife of Trafford Bradshaw, to whom she has now been married for fifty years (the pair celebrate their golden wedding anniversary at the end of \"Something Rotten\"). As the books never describe her character to any great degree, Melanie remains in the background. Hence, no reader ever discovers that she is, in fact, a gorilla, although she often attempts to dress in standard female clothing, with varying degrees of success. Melanie often babysits Friday Next when Thursday is off on assignment and the two are very close.\n\nThe main character of a series of 1920s adventure stories for boys. An early Booksplorer, Bradshaw now works as an agent for JurisFiction (he is a former Bellman as well) and is considered to be one of their best operatives; his maps, while sometimes incomplete, are a most trusted resource for Bookworld explorers.\n\nThe supposed creator of the BookWorld, and is worshipped as a god. Appears at the end of \"Well\" as a literal deus ex machina, as it is summoned by Thursday through an emergency glass box inside her standard issue equipment. It is unclear of the Great Panjandrum's true nature, and its appearance is based on the appearance of whoever views it; for example, Thursday sees it as a woman in her mid-thirties, like herself, while a noted Jurisfiction sculptor perceived the entity as a fellow stonemason. The Great Panjandrum is a reference to a line of nonsense verse by Samuel Foote.\n\nWanted murderer in the Book World, he escapes and works under the alias of Norman Johnson. In \"Something Rotten\" he is tainted with Slapstick to help track him across fiction, but he uses it to try to kill Thursday several times. Based on the minotaur from Greek mythology.\n\nAssigned to stay with Thursday in the unpublished novel \"Caversham Heights\" during the events of \"Lost in a Good Book\", Randolph and Lola started out as truly generic characters, being sexless, ageless, nameless and with no distinguishing features of any kind. Under Thursday's influence, the pair gradually began to take on more distinctive characteristics, developing personalities, choosing genders, apparent ages and final names, Thursday having initially dubbed them as \"obb\" and \"ibb\" respectively, just to distinguish between them. The two later gained capital letters before changing names. Randolph took on the persona and appearance of a gentleman in his fifties, hoping to be cast in the role of a father figure or kindly mentor. Lola developed as an attractive young woman, aiming for a position as heroine in an adventure-style tale. Although the pair argued constantly, they ultimately realized that they were in love and were instrumental in the reorganization of \"Caversham Heights\" into a book where characters from other novels could take holidays away from the rather repetitious nature of their roles.\n\nJack Spratt is the main character in the unpublished novel \"Caversham Heights\" where Thursday stays as part of the Character Exchange Program during the events of \"The Well of Lost Plots\". He is also the protagonist in his own series of books written by Fforde.\n\nMrs. Tiggy-Winkle is an active JurisFiction agent and their washerwoman. She trains Emperor Zhark and advocates for the appearances of hedgehogs in other works such as mentions in Shakespeare's plays. After Thursday's retirement she helps to run JurisFiction and visits Thursday asking for help.\n\nA ruthless tyrant from a series of sci-fi novels, Zhark begins work at JurisFiction around the same time as Thursday and is apprenticed to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. His conflicts within his books, often involving the lives of millions, are a point of contention requiring the Judgement of Solomon. Often punished for overdoing it, such as when he invades a Western with his armies to save Thursday, accidentally killing the main character. When he learns that his author, Handley Paige, is planning to kill him off, he manages to track him down and convince him otherwise.\n\nMillon is a member of the Amalgamated Union of Stalkers, authorised by SpecOps-33. He has something of a talent for spotting rising stars, having started stalking the legendary actress Lola Vavoom when she was just a bit part player. He is now a Grade 1 stalker, allowed to stalk the very highest level of celebrity, but has, instead, chosen to become Thursday's officially licensed stalker, feeling that she, while not at the highest level as yet, is destined for great things. Having published his autobiography \"A Stalk on the Wild Side\", Millon has attained a not-inconsiderable level of celebrity himself and has his own stalker, Adam Gnusense (who, as an experienced stalker himself, having risen to Grade 3, has recently acquired his own stalker, who he describes as being a Grade 34 loser after catching him rummaging through his dustbins).\n\nMillon is intelligent, polite and has considerable knowledge of conspiracy theories, a resource that Thursday draws upon when trying to locate a clone of William Shakespeare. He accompanied her to Area 21, an area in mid-Wales where the Goliath Corporation had their laboratories, to help out. As this was technically outside the remit of his stalker activities, he asked, in return, if he could be her official biographer, something to which Thursday readily agreed.\n\nMany of the excerpts from fictional works found at the beginning of each chapter have ostensibly been written by de Floss. His name is an allusion to the novel \"The Mill on the Floss\" by George Eliot, which Thursday and Miss Havisham visit on assignment in \"The Well of Lost Plots\".\n\nMade England's President-for-life after his resistance work during the German Occupation, and his song \"When I'm Washing Windows\" becomes the national anthem. In 1988 he is still entertaining whenever possible, and he is the only politician who avoids Yorrick Kaine enough to remain immune to the ovinator and thus oppose Kaine's schemes. He dies of natural causes two days after the Swindon Mallets win the Superhoop croquet championship and serenades the ferryman on his final journey. In real life, George Formby died in 1961, at the age of 56.\n\nNamed after two giants and quite tall himself, John Henry Goliath V is the great-great-grandson of the founder of the Goliath Corporation and its current CEO. He meets with Thursday personally to apologize to her, but in reality he used Goliath's ovinator to convince her to forgive them. His fate after Goliath's loss to the Toast Marketing Board is unknown.\n\nThe Prince of Denmark, from the Shakespeare play. He accompanied Thursday on her return to the real world at the beginning of \"Something Rotten\", as he was concerned at the perception in the Outland that he was an indecisive character. During his time there, he became romantically involved with Lady Emma Hamilton and found a new decisiveness within himself, one that he originally planned to take back into his play and rewrite it from within, portraying himself as a much more dynamic character. Ultimately, however, he came to realise that the flaws in his character are what make his play memorable and much loved, and elected to leave his play as it was. He chose to focus his energies elsewhere, joining JurisFiction as their agent for the Shakespearean and Marlowe plays.\n\nHamlet's Danish origins are a point of contention during Kaine's anti-Denmark campaign, but he bluffs Kaine into thinking he has gathered an army of Daphne Farquitt fans and the Copenhagen-born author herself to save Thursday at a critical moment. As a parting gift, Thursday gave Hamlet Alan the dodo, the tearaway son of her own dodo, Pickwick, to take with him, as Hamlet had proven to be the only one able to get Alan to behave himself.\n\nDaughter of Thursday Next. She first appeared at the very end of \"Something Rotten\", when many of Thursday's as-yet unborn descendants appear. In First Among Sequels, she is shown to be a mathematical genius, having solved Fermat's Last Theorem at the age of nine.\n\nFriday is the son of Thursday and Landen Parke-Laine. While he is an infant during the chronology of the novels, Friday later joins SO-12, the Chronoguard, rising to become head of the department and, according to his grandfather, Colonel Next, a time manipulator of extraordinary skill. As such, he appears as an adult on a couple of occasions in the books, although is unidentified until the end of \"Something Rotten\". As a baby, Friday speaks only Lorem Ipsum, due to his upbringing in the Bookworld. He is close to Melanie Bradshaw, who frequently baby-sat for him.\n\nIn First Among Sequels, Friday is apparently a lazy, slovenly adolescent whom Thursday calls a \"tedious teenage cliché: grunting, sighing at any request, and staying in bed until past midday.\" In actuality, this indolence is a cover for his secret agenda to overthrow Chronoguard, which his future self has found to be corrupt.\n\nThe only surviving clone of William Shakespeare, created in a secret long-abandoned project by Goliath. He is rescued by Thursday, Bowden, Stig, and Spike, and is recruited by JurisFiction to rewrite \"Hamlet\" and \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", which merged in Hamlet's absence. Shgakespeafe appears to be just as talented a writer as Shakespeare; indeed, all of his lines in \"Something Rotten\" are quotes from Shakespeare's plays. He is athletically skilled, having lived much of his life avoiding cloned creatures. His name developed from a typo at Jasper Fforde's keyboard, which he subsequently loved.\n\nA thirteenth-century prophet from Swindon, St Zvlkx's sixth Revealment was a prediction of his own resurrection in 1988, which Joffy Next prepares for by learning Old English to communicate with the saint. Joffy and the Idolatry Friends of St Zvlkx had sold the seer's wisdom to the Toast Marketing Board, which Zvlkx approved of. Over his stay in the twentieth century he is revealed to live nothing like a saintly life, and he is killed by a bus on the way to a bookie's. After Thursday helps the Swindon Mallets croquet team win the Superhoop, fulfilling the seventh and final Revealment, Thursday's father explains that Zvlkx had travelled through time himself, and that his Revealments were in fact bets now worth billions of pounds. Because the bookie's was owned ultimately by Goliath, the Toast Marketing Board took control of the majority of the multinational and ended their reign over England.\n\nJenny is the youngest of Thursday's three children, and ten years old during the time of the 5th novel. She is the only child in Thursday's family not to be named after a day of the week, so that (in Thursday's words) \"one of us should have a semblance of normality\". Jenny never actually makes an appearance during the novel, and is later revealed to be nonexistent, placed in Thursday's mind in an act of vengeance by Aornis Hades. Thursday occasionally remembers this, then forgets that she has remembered. Thursday's family understands this and works to keep 'Jenny' alive to save her from torment.\n\nThursday1-4 is the fictional version of Thursday Next, the main character of the first four books in a bestselling series loosely based on Thursday's adventures in SpecOps and Jurisfiction. Thursday1-4 is portrayed as unnecessarily violent and somewhat sleazy, and the real Thursday describes her as being \"mostly action, and very little thought.\" Despite the books being set several years before, Thursday1-4's apparent age is identical to the real Thursday, a fact that is explained in One of Our Thursdays Is Missing.\n\nThursday5 is the main character in the fifth book of the Thursday Next series. In response to the real Thursday's complaints about her portrayal in the first four books, and her insistence that the fifth book in the series reflect her more sensitive side, the fictional Thursday5 is depicted as overly softhearted and a bit of a hippie. Thursday takes her on as a cadet for training for Jurisfiction, but is consistently frustrated by Thursday5's incompetence and excessive pacifism. Like Thursday1-4, Thursday5 also looks identical to the real Thursday, despite a supposed age difference.\n"}
{"id": "1914895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914895", "title": "Zahir al-Umar", "text": "Zahir al-Umar\n\nZahir al-Umar al-Zaydani, alternatively spelled \"Daher al-Omar\" or \"Dahir al-Umar\" (; \"Ẓāhir āl-ʿUmar az-Zaydānī\", 1689/90 – 21 August 1775) was the autonomous Arab ruler of Palestine in the mid-18th century, while the area was still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire. For much of his reign, starting in the 1730s, his domain mainly consisted of Galilee, with successive headquarters in Tiberias, Arraba, Nazareth, Deir Hanna and finally Acre, in 1746. He fortified Acre, and the city became a center of the cotton trade between Palestine and Europe. In the mid-1760s, he reestablished the port town of Haifa nearby.\n\nZahir successfully withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman governors of the Sidon and Damascus provinces, who attempted to limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of the Eyalet of Egypt and with backing from Russia, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At the peak of his power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.\n\nThe wealth Zahir accumulated through monopolizing Palestine's cotton and olive oil trade to Europe financed his sheikhdom. For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local peasantry. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged Christian and Jewish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants from other parts of the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the Zaydani clan, also patronized the construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine has made him a national hero among Palestinians today.\n\nZahir was born in the village of 'Arrabat al-Battuf in central Galilee. His date of birth is not definitively known, with the years 1686, 1689/90 and 1694 cited by Zahir's contemporary biographers Volney, Mikha'il Sabbagh and Khalil al-Muradi, respectively. According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, 1689/1690 is the most likely year of his birth because he considers Sabbagh to be the most reliable source for Zahir's personal life. The proper transliteration of his given name is \"Ẓāhir\", but in the local dialect of Arabic used in Galilee, his name was pronounced \"Ḍāhir\". Zahir's family, the Zaydani clan, were Sunni Muslim notables from the Qaisi tribal confederation based in the Tiberias area who had strong connections to the Arab-Bedouin tribesmen of Galilee, which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire. Zahir was the youngest of four sons born to Sheikh Umar al-Zaydani; his brothers were Sa'd, Salih \"Abu Dani\" and Yusuf, and his sister was Shammah. Zahir grew up in the village of Saffuriya.\n\nZahir's father and grandfather had both served as the \"multazim\" (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed \"multazim\" of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became the head of the family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that in the event of a default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.\n\nIn 1707, Zahir was involved in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a man. As a result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of Bi'ina was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of Sidon Eyalet sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir played an important role in defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local peasantry throughout the 1720s.\n\nAlong with Sa'd, he also gained prestige among the people of Damascus, with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father. Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghaffar al-Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al-Husayni family, which provided the \"sharifs\" of Damascus at the time; Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to Nazareth because she considered Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune.\n\nIn the late 1720s, Zahir and his brother Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, captured Tiberias and its \"multazim\". Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to Köprülü Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the \"multazim\" of oppression and of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him \"multazim\" of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe. This was the first time a Zaydani \"multazim\" was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon. Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the \"multazim\" of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.\n\nZahir extended his rule southward toward Nazareth and the Marj Ibn Amer plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and Jabal Nablus. Capturing these areas was a drawn-out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in Safad Sanjak, but controlled by the Jarrar clan based in Nablus Sanjak) caused the ruling clans of the Nablus hinterland (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to challenge him. Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, Maghrebi mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents. In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer, killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth. According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.\n\nFollowing his victory at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, including many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops with food and water. Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.\n\nIn 1738, Zahir's forces captured the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule complained that he governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed \"multazim\" of Jiddin's subdistrict.\n\nBi'ina, which was also fortified, withstood a siege by Zahir in 1739, but Zahir later married the daughter of Bi'ina's \"mukhtar\" (headman), and thus brought Bi'ina into his domain. He also acquired the fortress of Suhmata through diplomatic means, further solidifying his rule over northern and eastern Galilee. In 1740, Zahir made an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to end their looting raids in the area. By then, Sa'd had taken control of Deir Hanna and Muhammad ibn Ali captured Shefa-'Amr, entrenching the presence of the Zaydani clan in western Galilee. After negotiations, Muhammad al-Naf'i, the \"multazim\" of Safad, surrendered the city to Zahir. Safad was the administrative seat of the \"sanjak\" and situated on a strategic hill overlooking the Galilee countryside. Zahir later acquired the fortified village of Deir al-Qassi after marrying the daughter of its sheikh, Abd al-Khaliq Salih.\n\nZahir's conquest of the Safad region and western Galilee removed the barriers between him and the Metawali (Shia Muslim) clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir informed the Metawalis' sheikh, Nasif al-Nassar, of his intent to acquire the fortified villages of al-Bassa and Yaroun on the borders between the Zaydani and Metawali sheikhdoms. In response, Sheikh Nasif launched an assault against Zahir and the two sides confronted each other in indecisive skirmishes in the border village of Tarbikha. Zahir then received reinforcements from his Maghrebi cavalry and defeated the Metawalis, pursuing Sheikh Nasif to his headquarters in Tibnin. Zahir's brother Sa'd mediated an end to the fighting and secured a mutual defense pact between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif, whereby the former would receive control of al-Bassa and Yaroun and the Metawalis' support in his confrontations with the governors of Damascus; in return, Sheikh Nasif's sons, who were captured by Zahir's troops, were released, the Metawalis' tax payments to Sidon were reduced by some 25 percent, and Zahir guaranteed his backing of Sheikh Nasif in any confrontation with the governors of Sidon.\n\nZahir, similar to other local strongmen in the Ottoman Empire who did not owe their power to the central Ottoman authorities, was disliked by the Ottoman administration. The Ottoman Sultan sent an order to the governor of Damascus Eyalet, Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, to put an end to Zahir's rule in Galilee. In September 1742, a military force led by the governor of Damascus came to Galilee and laid siege to Tiberias. After 83 days, the siege was lifted due to the departure of the Hajj pilgrim caravan. Using this respite, Zahir reinforced the defenses of Tiberias and Shefa-'Amr. In July 1743, backed by the Bani Saqr, the \"wali\" of Tripoli and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza and Irbid, Sulayman Pasha renewed his expedition, this time seeking to reduce Deir Hanna and sever Tiberias's links to the outside. Sulayman died suddenly in Lubya and Zahir used the opportunity to assault Sulayman's troops, capturing their camp. In 1745, Zahir had a fortress erected on a hill overlooking Saffuriya.\n\nZahir consolidated his authority over Acre in a drawn-out process starting in the 1730s. His Acre-based partner, the Melkite merchant Yusuf al-Qassis, served as an early link between Zahir and the French merchants of Acre. Zahir's first contact with the merchants came in 1731 when he arranged the settlement of debts owed to them by his brother Sa'd. In 1743, To stymie his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali's ambitions in Acre, Zahir had him arrested and executed. In 1743, Zahir requested the tax farm of Acre from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, who, wary of Zahir's growing power in the province, rejected the request. Instead, Zahir took Acre by force in July 1746.\n\nIn the first few years following his takeover of Acre, Zahir resided in the fortress of Deir Hanna in the heart of Galilee. He began fortifying Acre by building walls around the city in 1750. He built other fortifications and buildings in Acre as well. In 1757 he took control of the Mediterranean port villages of Haifa and Tantura, and nearby Mount Carmel, all of which had been part of Damascus Eyalet, unlike most of Zahir's domain at the time, which was in Sidon Eyalet. He also captured the port village of al-Tira, between Tantura and Haifa, at that time. Zahir's stated justification to the Ottoman authorities for conquering Palestine's northern coastal plain was to protect the area from Maltese pirates.\n\nIn late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir maintained ties with, launched an assault on the Hajj caravan as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government), and discredited the governor of Damascus and \"amir al-hajj\", Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.\n\nHusayn Pasha's replacement, Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, who took office in 1760, sought to retrieve control of Haifa from Zahir. Uthman Pasha requested that the governor of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761. The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over with the assistance of an Istanbul-based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high-ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders.\n\nIn 1761, Zahir ordered his son Uthman al-Zahir to assassinate Zahir's brother Sa'd because the latter had been collaborating with Uthman Pasha and the Bani Saqr tribe to kill Zahir and replace him. Sa'd's assassination indirectly led to the first conflict between Zahir and his sons, in this case Uthman. The latter had been promised control over Shefa-'Amr in return for killing Sa'd, but Zahir reneged due to pleas by Shefa-'Amr's residents not to appoint Uthman as their governor. Backed by his full-brothers Ahmad and Sa'd al-Din, who were angered by Zahir's refusal to cede them more territory, Uthman besieged Shefa-'Amr in 1765. However, under Zahir's instructions, the locals in the vicinity defended the town and succeeded in preventing its capture. The three brothers then appealed to Zahir's eldest and most loyal son, Salibi, to intervene on their behalf with Zahir, but Salibi was unable to persuade Zahir to make concessions. The four brothers then attempted to rekindle their alliance with the Bani Saqr, who Zahir had since routed at the Marj Ibn Amer plain in 1762.\n\nThe brothers' efforts to recruit the Bani Saqr failed when Zahir bribed the tribe not to back his sons and subsequently had Uthman imprisoned in Haifa for six months before exiling him to a village near Safad. Meanwhile, in 1765, Zahir had Haifa demolished and then rebuilt and fortified at a site three kilometers to the southeast in 1769. While the old village was situated on a plain, the new town, which remained a port along the Haifa Bay, was built on a narrow strip of land at the northern foot of Mount Carmel to make it easier to defend by land. In May 1766, Uthman renewed his rebellion against Zahir with backing from the Druze clans of Galilee, but this coalition was defeated by Zahir near Safad. This conflict expanded to include competing Druze and Shia factions from Mount Lebanon and Jabal Amil, with Emir Mansur Shihab (the Sunni leader of a Druze faction) and the Metawali, Sheikh Qublan, siding with Zahir, while Emir Yusuf Shihab (the leader of another Druze faction) and Sheikh Nasif sided with Uthman. Mediation by Emir Isma'il Shihab of Hasbaya culminated in a successful peace summit near Tyre between the two factions and a reconciliation between Zahir and Uthman, whereby the latter was granted control of Nazareth.\n\nIn September 1767, conflict between Zahir and his son Ali al-Zahir of Safad commenced over the former's refusal to cede to the latter control of the strategic fortress of Deir Hanna or the village of Deir al-Qassi. Prior to the dispute, Ali had been loyal to Zahir and proven himself effective in helping his father suppress dissent among his brothers and in battles against external enemies. Zahir's forces intimidated Ali into surrendering later that month, and Zahir pardoned and ultimately ceded to him Deir al-Qassi. However, conflict was renewed weeks later with Ali and his brother Sa'id, backed by Sheikh Nasif, Emir Yusuf and Uthman Pasha poised against Zahir, Uthman, Sheikh Qublan and Muhammad Pasha al-Azm, governor of Sidon. With mediation from Ibrahim Sabbagh, Zahir's financial adviser, Zahir settled his dispute with Sa'id, granting the latter control over Tur'an and Hittin.\n\nAli refused to negotiate, gained the backing of Salibi, and the two defeated their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were put to rest for several years (until 1774–75), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.\n\nIn 1768 the central Ottoman authorities partially recognized or legitimized Zahir's \"de facto\" political position by granting him the title of \"Sheikh of Acre, Emir of Nazareth, Tiberias, Safed, and Sheikh of all Galilee\". However, this official recognition was tempered when Yaqub Agha was executed shortly after and Sulayman Agha died in 1770, depriving Zahir of close allies in Istanbul. In November 1770, Uthman Pasha had the governor of Sidon replaced by his son Darwish Pasha and had his other son, Muhammad Pasha, appointed governor of Tripoli Eyalet. Uthman Pasha was committed to ending Zahir's rule, and Zahir's position was left particularly vulnerable with the loss of support in Istanbul. In response to threats from Damascus, Zahir further strengthened Acre's fortifications and armed every adult male in the city with a rifle, two pistols and a sabre. He also moved to mend ties with his sons, who held various tax farms in Galilee, and consolidate his relationship with the Shia clans of Jabal Amil, thereby strengthening his local alliances.\n\nAlthough Zahir was bereft of friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new alliance with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the Hejaz, Ali Bey al-Kabir. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey. Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made it as far as Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.\n\nZahir was surprised and angered by Ismail's reticence to attack. In a unilateral move to impose his authority in Uthman Pasha's jurisdiction, Zahir had his son Ahmad and other subordinate commanders collect taxes from villages in Damascus Eyalet, including Quneitra, while he dispatched his other son Ali on a campaign against the Bani Nu'aym tribe in Hauran, also part of Damascus. In response to Zahir's indignation, Ali Bey sent him 35,000 troops under Abu al-Dhahab in May. Together with Ismail's troops in Jaffa, the Egyptian army captured Damascus from Uthman Pasha in June, while Zahir and his Metawali allies captured the city of Sidon from Darwish Pasha. However, Abu al-Dhahab was persuaded by Ismail that confronting the Ottoman sultan, who carried a high religious authority as the caliph of Islam, was \"truly ... a scheme of the Devil\" and a crime against their religion. A short time after capturing Damascus, Abu al-Dhahab and Ismail subsequently withdrew from the city, whose inhabitants were \"completely astonished at this amazing event\", according to a chronicler of the time period. The sudden turn of events compelled Zahir's forces to withdraw from Sidon on 20 June.\n\nAbu al-Dhahab's withdrawal frustrated Zahir who proceeded to make independent moves, first by capturing Jaffa in August 1771, after driving out its governor Ahmad Bey Tuqan, and shortly thereafter, capturing the cotton-producing Bani Sa'b region (centered around modern-day Tulkarm), which was held by Mustafa Bey Tuqan. Zahir had Jaffa fortified and stationed 2,000 troops there. By the end of August, Zahir remained in control of Jaffa, while Uthman Pasha had restored his control over Ramla and Gaza.\n\nIn an attempt to expand his zone of influence to Nablus, the commercial center of Palestine and its agriculturally-rich hinterland, Zahir besieged Nablus in late 1771. By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful Jarrar clan, who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the \"miri\" (\"hajj\" pilgrimage tax). Nablus was under the \"de facto\" control of the Tuqan and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated.\n\nUthman Pasha had resumed his governorship of Damascus at the end of June 1771 and was determined to eliminate Zahir. To that end, he assembled a coalition that included his sons Darwish Pasha al-Kurji and Muhammad Pasha al-Kurji, who were the governors of Sidon and Tripoli, respectively, and Emir Yusuf Shihab of Mount Lebanon. In late August Uthman Pasha reached Lake Hula at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops. Before Uthman Pasha could be joined by his allies, Zahir and Sheikh Nasif of the Metawalis confronted the governor's troops on 2 September. Ali al-Zahir, Zahir's son and a commander of one of his four battlefield regiments, raided Uthman Pasha's camp, while Zahir's other troops blocked them from the west. Uthman Pasha's troops hastily retreated towards the Jordan River, the only place where they were not surrounded. The overwhelming majority drowned in the river, with only 300–500 survivors, including Uthman Pasha who almost drowned but was rescued by one of his men. The Battle of Lake Hula marked a decisive victory for Zahir, who entered Acre triumphantly with the spoils of Uthman Pasha's camp. He was celebrated by the residents of the city and on the way there, he was given honorary gun salutes by each of his fortified villages on the route between Tiberias and Acre. He also received congratulations from the French merchant ships at the port of Acre. Zahir's victory encouraged Ali Bey to relaunch his Syrian campaign.\n\nFollowing his victory against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, which he did on 13 October. He returned two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at Nabatieh on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, only to have the pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of Deir al-Qamar, while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte. Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.\n\nMuhammad Tuqan captured Jaffa from Zahir in May 1772, the same month that Ali Bey arrived in Acre to seek Zahir's protection after being forced out of Egypt by rival mamluks. In June, the Ottoman loyalist Jazzar Pasha sought to establish himself in Lebanon and took over Beirut from the local Druze chieftains. The Druze had previously been in conflict with Zahir, but due to Jazzar's offensive, the circumstances fostered an alliance between them, Zahir and the Metawali clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir and Ali Bey sought to take back Jaffa and, with help from the Russian Fleet, succeeded after a nine-month siege, in which they exhausted many of their resources. Prior to that, in late October 1772, Zahir and his Lebanese allies captured Beirut from Jazzar, also with Russian naval support.\n\nIn March 1773, Ali Bey left Palestine to reestablish himself in Egypt, but Abu al-Dhahab had him killed when he arrived there. With this came an end to the alliance between Zahir and Ali Bey, which had brought together Egypt and Palestine politically and economically in a way that had not occurred since the early 16th century. While their attempts to unite their territories economically and politically were unsuccessful, their rule posed the most serious domestic challenge to Ottoman rule in the 18th century. As a consequence of Ali Bey's death, Zahir moved to further strengthen his hold over Jaffa and capture Jerusalem, but he failed in the latter attempt. All of Ottoman Syria came under the official command of Uthman Pasha al-Misri in 1774 in order to bring stability to the provinces of the region. Al-Misri did not seek conflict with Zahir and sought to establish friendly terms with him. As such, he convinced the Sublime Porte to officially appoint Zahir as the governor of Sidon as long as Zahir paid all of the taxes the province had owed to the Porte. Al-Misri further promoted Zahir in February by declaring him \"Governor of Sidon, Nablus, Gaza, Ramla, Jaffa and Jabal Ajlun\", although this title was not officially sanctioned by the Porte. In effect, Zahir was the \"de facto\" ruler over Palestine (with the exception of Nablus and Jerusalem), Jabal Amil, and the Syrian coast from Gaza to Beirut.\n\nAl-Misri was recalled to Istanbul in the summer of 1774 and Muhammad Pasha al-Azm was appointed governor of Damascus. Thus, Zahir's governorship of Sidon was left vulnerable because it had largely depended on guarantees from al-Misri. Al-Azm sought peaceful relations with Zahir, but the Sublime Porte, having made peace with Russia and relieving itself from that conflict, aimed to undermine the rebellious rulers of its provinces, including Zahir. Al-Azm managed to secure an official pardon of Zahir from the Porte in April 1775, but not the governorship of Sidon. Meanwhile, conflict between Zahir and his sons had reignited, with Ali of Safad attempting to capture Zahir's villages in Galilee in 1774. Zahir defeated Ali with support from his other son, Ahmad of Tiberias. Afterward, Zahir's rule was again challenged by one of his other sons, Sa'id, later that year. In response to this challenge, Zahir armed and mobilized 300 of Acre's civilian inhabitants to counter Sa'id. Ali continued to undermine Zahir's rule by encouraging defections by Zahir's Maghrebi mercenaries through bribes.\n\nOn 20 May 1775, Abu al-Dhahab, having been encouraged by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al-Ifranj (the French Caravanserai) for safekeeping. On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon. Ali al-Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al-Dhahab's troops approached it a few days later. They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil. Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al-Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re-entered the city two days later and reestablished order with the assistance of Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli. However, the setback of Abu al-Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands.\n\nOn 23 April, the Porte dispatched the Ottoman Navy admiral, Hasan Pasha al-Jazayiri, to blockade Acre. He reached Haifa on 7 August taking Jaffa from Zahir's son-in-law, Karim al-Ayyubi. Hasan Pasha ordered Zahir to pay the \"miri\" dues he owed to the Sublime Porte dating back to 1768. Zahir initially agreed to pay 500,000 piasters of the total amount upfront and a further 50,000 piasters to Hasan Pasha himself to \"spare the blood of the people\". Hasan Pasha apparently accepted Zahir's proposals, but the arrangements fell apart.\n\nThe accounts differ as to exactly how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure was the result of disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the \"miri\" dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the \"miri\" dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.\n\nHasan proceeded to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning fire from the city's artillerymen; al-Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces to refrain from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, Zahir attempted to flee Acre on 21 or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.\n\nFollowing his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih were arrested by Hasan Pasha's men. The Sublime Porte also seized property belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital along with their physician, who was known to be talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.\n\nZahir's sons Uthman, Ahmad, Sa'id and Ali continued to put up resistance, with the latter putting up the longest fight from his fortress in Deir Hanna. The fortress eventually capitulated to the combined forces of Hasan Pasha and Jazzar Pasha on 22 July 1776. Ali fled, but was killed later that year in the area between Tiberias and Safad. By then, the rest of Zahir's sons had been arrested or killed. Abbas was later appointed by Sultan Selim III as the Sheikh of Safad. However, in 1799, when Napoleon invaded Palestine, but withdrew after being defeated in Acre, Abbas and Salih both left Safad with the departing French forces. This marked the end of Zaydani influence in Galilee.\n\nConstantin-François Volney, who wrote the first European biography of Zahir in 1787, lists three main reasons for Zahir's failure. First, the lack of \"internal good order and justness of principle\". Secondly, the early concessions he made to his children. Third, and most of all, the avarice of his adviser and confidant, Ibrahim Sabbagh.\n\nZahir appointed many of his brothers and sons as local administrators, particularly after he consolidated his control over Acre, which became the capital of his territory. Except for Acre and Haifa, Zahir divided the remainder of his territory between his relatives. His eldest brother was appointed to Deir Hanna, and his younger brothers Yusuf and Salih Abu Dani were installed in I'billin and Arraba, respectively. Zahir appointed his eldest son Salibi as the \"multazim\" of Tiberias. Salibi was killed in 1773 fighting alongside Ali Bey's forces in Egypt. His death deeply distressed Zahir, who was around 80 years old at the time. He appointed Uthman in Kafr Kanna then Shefa-'Amr, Abbas in Nazareth, Ali in Safad, and Ahmad in Saffuriya. Ahmad replaced Salibi in Tiberias as well, and also conquered Ajlun and Salt in Transjordan. In addition, Ahmad was given authority over Deir Hanna after Sa'd's death. Zahir appointed his nephew Ayyub al-Karimi in Jaffa and Gaza, while al-Dinkizli was made \"multazim\" in Sidon in 1774. The appointment of Zahir's relatives and close associates was meant to ensure the efficient administration of his expanding realm and the loyalty of his circle. Among their chief functions was to ensure the supply of cotton to Acre. It is not clear if these posts were recognized by the Ottoman government.\n\nZahir had an aide who jointly served in the capacity of \"mudabbir\" (manager) and \"wazir\" (vizier) to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence. This official had always been a Melkite (local Greek Catholic). His first \"wazir\" was Yusuf al-Arqash, followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to Malta. He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh, who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local Greek Orthodox Christian and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite. Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir largely because of the wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in Damietta, Egypt. Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's political adviser, main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials.\n\nThere were other officials in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the \"mufti\" and the \"qadi\". The mufti was the chief scholar among the \"ulama\" (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same \"mufti\" for many years at a time in contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its \"mufti\" replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the \"qadi\" from Palestine's local \"ulama\", but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the \"qadi\" of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who in the last years of his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi. An \"agha\" was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.\n\nZahir's initial military forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen and the local inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The core of his private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of the remainder of his rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from Venice or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.\n\nAccording to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, the two principal conditions Zahir established to foster his sheikhdom's prosperity and its survival were \"security and justice\". Prior to Zahir's consolidation of power, the villages of northern Palestine were prone to Bedouin raids and robberies and the roads were under constant threat from highway robbers and Bedouin attacks. Although following the looting raids, the inhabitants of these agrarian villages were left destitute, the Ottoman provincial government would nonetheless attempt to collect from them the \"miri\" (hajj tax). To avoid punitive measures for not paying the \"miri\", the inhabitants would abandon their villages for safety in the larger towns or the desert. This situation hurt the economy of the region as the raids sharply reduced the villages' agricultural output, the government-appointed \"mutasallims\" (tax farmers) could not collect their impositions, and trade could not be safely conducted due to insecurity on the roads.\n\nBy 1746, however, Zahir had established order in the lands he ruled. He managed to co-opt the dominant Bedouin tribe of the region, the Bani Saqr, which greatly contributed to the establishment of security in northern Palestine. Moreover, Zahir charged the \"sheikhs\" of the towns and villages of northern Palestine with ensuring the safety of the roads in their respective vicinity and required them to compensate anyone who was robbed of his/her property. General security reached a level whereby \"an old woman with gold in her hand could travel from one place to another without fear or danger\", according to biographer Mikhail Sabbagh.\n\nThis period of calm that persisted between 1744 and 1765 greatly boosted the security and economy of Galilee. The security established in the region encouraged people from other parts of the Ottoman Empire to immigrate to Galilee. Conflict between the local clans and between Zahir and his sons remained limited to periodic clashes, while there were no attacks against Zahir's domain from outside forces. While Zahir used force to strengthen his position in the region, the local inhabitants generally took comfort in his rule, which historian Thomas Philip described as \"relatively just and reasonably fair\". According to Richard Pococke who visited the area in 1737, the local people had great admiration for Zahir, especially for his war against bandits on the roads.\n\nIn addition to providing security, Zahir and his local deputies adopted a policy of aiding the peasants cultivate and harvest their farmlands to further guarantee the steady supply of agricultural products for export. These benefits included loans to peasants and the distribution of free seeds. Financial burdens on the peasants were also reduced as Zahir offered tax relief during drought seasons or when the harvest seasons were poor. This same tax relief was extended to newcomers who sought to begin cultivating new farmlands. Moreover, Zahir assumed responsibility for outstanding payments the peasants owed to merchants from credit-based transactions if the merchants could provide proof of unsatisfactory payment. According to historian Thomas Philipp, Zahir \"had the good business sense not to exploit peasants to the point of destruction, but kept his financial demands to a more moderate level.\" He regularly paid the Ottoman authorities their financial dues, ensuring a degree of stability in his relationship with the sultanate.\n\nWhen Zahir conquered Acre, he transformed it from a decaying village into a fortified market hub for Palestinian products, including silk, wheat, olive oil, tobacco and cotton, which he exported to Europe. With cotton in particular, Zahir was able to monopolize the market for it and its foreign export. He did business with European merchants based in Galilee's ports, who competed with one another for the cotton and grain cultivated in the rural villages under Zahir's dominion or influence in Galilee's hinterland and Jabal Amil. Previously, European merchants made direct transactions with local cotton growers, but Zahir, with the help of Ibrahim Sabbagh, put an end to this system of commerce by making himself the middleman between the merchants and the growers living under his rule. This allowed him to both monopolize cotton production and the merchants' price for the product. Zahir's designation of prices for the local cash crops also prevented \"exploitation\" of the peasants and local merchants by European merchants and their \"manipulation of the prices\", according to Joudah. This caused financial losses to the European merchants who lodged numerous complaints to the French and English ambassadors to the Sublime Porte. A formal agreement to regulate commerce between Zahir and the European merchants was reached in 1753. Zahir further encouraged trade by offering local merchants interest-free loans.\n\nThe high European demand for the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his autonomous sheikhdom. This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order to benefit from the customs fees he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom as a result of its position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom.\n\nZahir maintained tolerant policies and encouraged the involvement of religious minorities in the local economy. As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee, Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742, along with Muslims. Zahir did not consider Jews to be a threat to his rule and believed that their connections with the Jewish diaspora would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance in the construction of Jewish homes, schools and synagogues, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area. The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from Aleppo, Cyprus and Smyrna. Many Jews in Safad, which was governed by Zahir's son Ali, moved to Tiberias in the 1740s to take advantage of better opportunities in that city, which at the time was under Zahir's direct rule. The villages of Kafr Yasif and Shefa-'Amr also saw new Jewish communities spring up under Zahir's rule.\n\nZahir encouraged local Christian settlement in Acre, in order to contribute to the city's commercial dynamism in trade and manufacturing. Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.\n\nZahir allowed the Franciscan community of Nazareth to build churches in 1730, 1741 and 1754 on sites Christians associated with Jesus's life. He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth, and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest church in the city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As a testament to the prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built under the auspices of Zahir's less tolerant successors.\n\nA strong relationship existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs and merchant class. Zahir maintained law and order in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skills. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their successful conflict with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab clan under Mulhim Shihab, .\n\nThe relationship between Zahir and the rural sheikhs of the Druze of Mount Lebanon under the Shihab dynasty were mixed. While Sheikh Mansur Shihab of Chouf allied himself with Zahir, his nephew and rival, Yusuf Shihab of the Tripoli region remained supportive of the Ottomans. Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze \"emirs\" of Mount Lebanon, the Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. In the oral traditions of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression. During this period, many Druze villages were either destroyed or abandoned and there was a partial Druze exodus from Galilee, particularly from the villages around Safad, to the Hauran region east of the Jordan River.\n\nZahir's clan belonged to the Qaisi political faction in the centuries-long struggle between the Qais and Yaman confederations. The Ma'an and Shihab dynasties, who ruled Mount Lebanon (and often Galilee) semi-autonomously, also belonged to the Qaisi faction. For the most part, Zahir respected the socio-political system that prevailed in the region he ruled. The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network of marriages between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan. Zahir's own marriages were politically advantageous as they allowed him to consecrate his rule over certain areas or his relationships with certain Bedouin tribes, local clans or urban notables. Zahir had five wives during his lifetime. Among his wives was a woman from the Sardiyah, a Bedouin tribe active in Transjordan and Palestine. Zahir was also married to a daughter of Sayyid Muhammad, a wealthy religious notable from Damascus, a daughter of the \"mukhtar\" (headman) of Bi'ina, and a daughter of the \"mukhtar\" of Deir al-Qassi.\n\nZahir had eight sons from his wives, and according to Tobias Smollett, a daughter as well. His sons, from eldest to youngest, were Salibi, Ali, Uthman, Sa'id, Ahmad, Salih, Sa'd al-Din and Abbas. His daughter's husband's name was Karim al-Ayyubi, who was also Zahir's cousin. By 1773, Zahir had a total of 272 children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nAs Zahir consolidated his power and reduced external threats to his rule in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other in order to secure their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power.\n\nZahir's rule radically changed the landscape of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre and the establishment of the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Claude Reignier Conder wrote that the Ottomans had successfully destroyed the power of Palestine's indigenous ruling families who \"had practically been their own masters\" but had been \"ruined so that there is no longer any spirit left in them\". Among these families were the \"proud race\" of Zahir, which was still held in high esteem, but was powerless and poor. Zahir's modern-day descendants in Galilee use the surname \"Dhawahri\" or \"al-Zawahirah\" in Zahir's honor. The Dhawahri clan constitute one of the traditional elite Muslim clans of Nazareth, alongside the Fahum, Zu'bi and 'Onallas families. Other villages in Galilee where descendants of Zahir's clan live are Bi'ina and Kafr Manda and, prior to its 1948 destruction, al-Damun. Many of the inhabitants of modern-day northern Israel, particularly the towns and villages where Zahir or his family left an architectural legacy, hold Zahir in high regard.\n\nAlthough he was mostly overlooked by historians of the Middle East, some scholars view Zahir's rule as a forerunner to Palestinian nationalism. Among these scholars is Karl Sabbagh, who asserts the latter view in his book \"Palestine: A Personal History\", which was widely reviewed in the British press in 2010. Zahir was gradually integrated into Palestinian historiography. In Murad Mustafa Dabbagh's \"Biladuna Filastin\" (1965), a multi-volume work about Palestine's history, Zahir is referred to as the \"greatest Palestinian appearing in the eighteenth century\". The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) radio station, Voice of Palestine, broadcast a series about Zahir in 1966, praising him as a Palestinian national hero who fought against Ottoman imperialism. Zahir is considered by many Arab nationalists as a pioneer of Arab liberation from foreign occupation. According to Joudah However historians may look at Shaykh Zahir al-'Umar and his movement, he is highly respected by the Arabs of the East. In particular the Palestinians consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian society that has elevated Zahir and his legacy to near-iconic status. These re-readings are not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the ongoing consequences of the Nakba. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a \"little Kingdom,\" as Albert Hourani called it, in most of Palestine for over a quarter of a century.\n\nZahir and his family built fortresses, watchtowers, warehouses, and \"khans\" (caravanserais). These buildings improved the domestic administration and general security of Galilee. Today, many of these structures are in a state of disrepair and remain outside the scope of Israel's cultural preservation laws.\n\nIn Acre, Zahir rebuilt the Crusader-era walls and built on top of various Crusader and Mamluk structures in the city. Among these were the caravanserais of Khan al-Shawarda and its Burj al-Sultan tower and Khan al-Shunah. In 1758, he commissioned the construction of the al-Muallaq Mosque in Acre. He also built the Seraya government house in Nazareth, which served as the city's municipal headquarters until 1991. In Haifa, which Zahir founded, he built a wall with four towers and two gates around the new settlement. Within Haifa, he built the Burj al-Salam fortress, a small mosque, a customs building, and a government residence (\"saraya\"). In Tiberias, he commissioned the building of a citadel (now ruined) and the al-Amari Mosque. The latter was built with alternating white and black stone, typical of the architectural style of Zahir's building works, and a minaret.\n\nFortifications and other structures were built in the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader fortress with the addition of a mosque and \"hamaam\" (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing. Another of his sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader fortress in Saffuriya.\n\nIn Tibnin, in modern-day Lebanon, and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader-era fortresses rebuilt. Zahir fortified the village of Harbaj, although the village and its fort were in ruins by the late 19th century. At Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Zahir built five fountains, one of which remained standing by the 19th century. That remaining fountain was the largest of its kind in Galilee. In the village of I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th-century, semi-autonomous Arab \"sheikh\" of Galilee.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1914908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914908", "title": "Ennoblement", "text": "Ennoblement\n\nEnnoblement is the conferring of nobility—the induction of an individual into the noble class. Currently only a few kingdoms still grant nobility to people among them Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Vatican. Depending on time and region, various laws have governed who could be ennobled and how. Typically, nobility was conferred on individuals who had assisted the sovereign. In some countries (e.g., France under the \"Ancien Régime\"), this degenerated into the buying of patents of nobility, whereby rich commoners (e.g., merchants) could purchase a title of nobility.\n\nMedieval theorists of nobility relied on earlier classical concepts (Platonic, Aristotelian and Christian-Hellenistic) of what personal traits and virtues constitute grounds for ennoblement. In Plato's Republic, he provides for promotion and degradation of citizens according to a strict spiritual meritocracy. In the words of Will Durant, \"If the ruler's son is a dolt he falls at the first shearing; if the boot-black's son is a man of ability the way is clear for him to become a guardian of the state\" (Durant, \"The Story of Philosophy\", 1961, p. 28). In medieval times, heraldic writers cited biblical examples to demonstrate that nobility is not just a matter of descent but of personal virtue: Shem, Ham and Japheth sprang from the same father, yet Ham was ignoble and King David rose from shepherd to become king through sheer faith and soldierly courage. Bartolus defined natural nobility by reference to Aristotle, who in his \"Politics\" explains how some are marked out for freedom by their virtues (and specifically by their capacity to rule), and are so distinguished from the mass of men whose talents fit them only for a servile role. Those free men whose virtues thus fit them to rule Bartolus defines as the natural nobility. With regard to natural nobility, Bartolus applauded Dante Alighieri's argument in his \"Convivio\" that nobility does not derive from ancient riches adorned with fine manners, but is the meed of individual virtue. Bartolus argues that the prince should strive to make his dominion a true mirror of God's own by advancing only those who are naturally noble (see Maurice Keen, \"Chivalry\", p. 149). Geoffroi de Charny, the noted celebrant of knighthood, argued \"God will mark out those who labor valorously, even though they come of little estate\" (\"Livre de chevalrie\", in Oeuvres de Froissart, ed. K. de Lettenhove I, pt. iii, 494, 495). During the Renaissance, the Platonic-Christian humanist belief in virtue as the essence of nobility was summed up in the Latin phrase: \"Virtus vera nobilitas est\" (Virtue is the True Nobility). The counter-revolutionary author Edmund Burke wrote on merit-based promotion: \"...the road to eminence and power, from obscure condition, ought not to be made too easy, nor a thing too much of course. If rare merit be the rarest of all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of probation. The temple of honor ought to be seated on an eminence. If it be opened through virtue, let it be remembered, too, that virtue is never tried but by some difficulty and some struggle.\" Napoleon Bonaparte and Friedrich Nietzsche were later to continue the tradition of promoting a vision of aristocratic meritocracy, although no longer within (and opposed to) the Catholic-chivalric framework.\n\nIn the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ennoblement (\"nobilitacja\") meant an individual's joining the \"szlachta\" (Polish nobility). At first it was granted by monarch, since the late 16th century by the \"sejm\" that gave the ennobled person a coat of arms. Often that person could join an existing noble szlachta family with their own coat of arms. The increase of number of Polish nobility by trustworthy ennoblements was proportionally minimal since the 14th century.\n\nIn the late 14th century, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors—\"bajorai\" (\"nobles\"; see the cognate \"\"boyar\"\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their military service to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men (veldams). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their family names, the Lithuanian pagan given names of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the Goštautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kęsgailos and others. These families were granted their coats of arms under the Union of Horodło (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King Sigismund I the Old confirmed the position of the Lithuanian Council of Lords in state politics and limited entry into the nobility.\n\nAfter the reforms of Tsar Peter the Great in the early 18th century, noblemen in Russia were obliged to serve as civil or military officials. Personal nobility was automatically conferred on all civil and military officials starting with the corresponding rank of captain. Hereditary nobility was conferred on all officials with the rank of colonel (Any given military post had an equivalent civil one, rank-wise). The system was later extended to merchants and industrialists that with a successful career managing a business of moderate size would achieve personal or hereditary nobility.\n\n"}

{"id": "1914920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914920", "title": "Pakistani cricket team in the West Indies in 2005", "text": "Pakistani cricket team in the West Indies in 2005\n\nPakistan toured West Indies for three ODIs and two Tests in May and June 2005. Pakistan got off to a great start in the warm-ups by beating the Antigua & Barbuda President's XI by 248 runs at Antigua and continued with a 59-run win in a low-scoring first match at St Vincent. The West Indian fans were to be disappointed again, though, as their team slumped to two successive losses in the ODIs at Gros Islet – losing the series 0–3, meaning that their home ODI record for 2005 read no wins, eight losses. They recuperated in the Tests, however, giving Pakistan eight and a half days of good cricket before imploding with the bat in the final innings to lose the second Test and thus having to settle with a drawn series, 1–1.\n\nThe Pakistanis beat the President's XI by 248 runs\n\nAt the ARG, Pakistani all-rounder Shahid Afridi was the star as the visitors got off to a great start in their warm-up. A 46-ball century from Afridi and big partnerships with Salman Butt and Shoaib Malik built the foundation for a massive target of 366 for 7. The President's XI was then undone by the spin of Afridi and Malik, Wilden Cornwall the only one who offered some resistance with 46. Afridi, however, took four wickets for six Runs – including two no-balls and a wide — and was undoubtedly Man of the Match.\n\n1st ODI, 18 May 2005\nWest Indies had lost six straight One Day Internationals before this one, and were looking to avoid a seventh straight loss against Pakistan. Despite that, however, the selectors had chosen to rest Brian Lara, West Indies star batsman, for the ODI series, citing that he needed rests for the upcoming Test matches as a reason. However, the game started well for the Windies, Shivnarine Chanderpaul winning the toss and electing to bowl. Wickets fell with reasonable regularity, despite Daren Powell getting punished by Shahid Afridi and Salman Butt early on. Afridi was run out for a typical 24 off 21 balls – good co-operation between Corey Collymore and wicket-keeper Courtney Browne resulted in that, although it would never have been out if Afridi hadn't lost his bat in mid-run. The Pakistan team got runs off Powell, but never got the better of Ian Bradshaw, and his hard work and good swing bowling paid off as he got the wicket of Shoaib Malik for 13, who was deceived attempting a cut shot. The score was then slowly increased by the Pakistan team, who reached 108 for 3 after 25 overs – having lost Salman for 43 after a slice that was well taken by Xavier Marshall at point. But from then on, everything went down for Pakistan. Youhana ran himself out on 30 (133 for 4), and Chris Gayle got the big wickets of Inzamam-ul-Haq (23) and Younis Khan (9) to reduce Pakistan to 153 for 6. Only a ninth-wicket partnership between Abdul Razzaq (22) and Iftikhar Anjum (8*) gave Pakistan hope, as they were all out for 192 in 44.3 overs – a target that most saw as possible, even on an Arnos Vale Stadium ground where the average first-innings score is 207.\n\nHowever, tight and intelligent bowling from Pakistan turned the match on its head. Xavier Marshall never looked comfortable at the crease, scoring three runs off sixteen balls before top-edging a short ball from Naved-ul-Hasan through to Pakistan's young wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal, who was to be one of the stars of the match. Naved-ul-Hasan got another victim with his short balls an over later, as Gayle mistimed it and edged it high to fine leg where Kamran dived thankfully – leaving West Indies at 26 for 2 with Ramnaresh Sarwan and Runako Morton trying to steady the ship. The West Indians were then frustrated by varied bowling from Pakistan, scoring six runs off the next seven overs, before Sarwan decided it was time to attack. He was probably out on 7, but the umpire declined the loud appeal, only for him to edge to slip two overs and two runs later. With the West Indies 44 for 3 after seventeen overs, it was time for captain Chanderpaul to try and save the innings. Instead, everyone fell around him – Runako Morton gone to Shahid Afridi's first delivery of the series, edging it to the keeper for 13, and persistent bowling on the off side paid off for Abdur Razzaq as he got Wavell Hinds to inside edge the ball through to the keeper for 11 – leaving West Indies at 76 for 5. In Razzaq's next over, Chanderpaul was dropped by Inzamam on the first ball, blocked the next three, then inside edged the fifth past his own stumps and into Kamran's waiting gloves. With the score 76 for 6, well behind Pakistan's at the time, it was only a question of whether they could survive 50 overs of this bowling. They couldn't – the last 20 overs were really just a display of pointless cricket. Dwayne Bravo offered some resistance with a gritty 27 that would not have been out of place in a Test match, but eventually was the last man to cave in to the pressure – attempting a big drive, he failed to connect well enough, and Shahid Afridi could catch the ball for Pakistan to win by 59 runs. Man of the Match was Abdul Razzaq, who turned the match with his four wickets and kept the pressure up on a pitch that became more and more difficult to read.\n\n2nd ODI, 21 May 2005\nA West Indies team in deep crisis were trying to avoid the series defeat at Gros Islet against Pakistan. The visitors won the toss and chose to bat on a grassy pitch, paying the price as Shahid Afridi mistimed a big cover drive (which had already given him runs from a six and a four so far in the day), off Daren Powell straight to Wavell Hinds, who took a grateful catch. A couple of overs later, Shoaib Malik attempted a quick single, but Powell was alert and grabbed the ball on his followthrough, pushing down the stumps at the wicketkeeper's end with relative ease and Salman Butt way out of the running to see him run out. \n\nShoaib Malik did struggle in this match, although he did get the runs eventually. Having run out his partner, he proceeded to struggle getting runs up – especially boundaries. Only a gift from Chris Gayle, who dropped a simple catch, ensured that he was still in and able to edge more runs. Yousuf Youhana from the other end, meanwhile, played a more calm and composed knock, before being controversially given out lbw by umpire Darrell Hair on 21 – some commentators argued that the sound heard was Youhana's bat hitting the pad, not the ball. However, a brisk knock from captain Inzamam-ul-Haq steadied the ship, and Shoaib Malik also found his footing eventually – before calling a too quick single, resulting in the second run out of the match and the fifth Pakistani run out of the series. With Shoaib gone for 51, Younis Khan joined Inzamam for a good partnership. It was abruptly shortened, though, when Inzamam got hit on the box by a straight full toss from Gayle, which could well have been lbw. As it was, Inzamam retired for 33, allowing a hard-hitting Abdul Razzaq to come to the crease. A blazing 20 followed before Corey Collymore reaped the rewards with his first ball of a return-spell – clean bowled. Inzamam thus returned to the crease with a runner – he chose Shoaib Malik, the man who had already caused two run outs earlier on in the morning. Three balls later, there could well have been a run-out, but the throw was off target and they saved the wicket. That turned out to be crucial, as Inzamam added a further sixteen runs to the Pakistan tally before slicing a drive off Gayle to backward point and a thankful Dwayne Bravo. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal then slashed a few boundaries to up the run rate, ending with 24 not out off 15 balls, but it was the fast bowler Corey Collymore who had the last laugh in the match – in the very final over, he dug out Younis Khan (caught well by Gayle for 48) and Naved-ul-Hasan (caught and bowled for 1) to finish with three wickets for 40, the best figures of the innings, while Pakistan set a very competitive target of 259, leaving the match hanging in the balance.\n\nThe Pakistan fielding effort started in jittery fashion, giving up three extras – two no-balls and a leg-bye – before letting an edge off Xavier Marshall run away for four. Then, Chris Gayle was suspected caught behind by all Pakistanis on 0, but the umpire turned down the appeal. Xavier Marshall was then out to a catch by Salman Butt for 6, and Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle consolidated – not altogether willingly, as Naved-ul-Hasan served up some accurate swing bowling. Gayle, however, went back on the attack – which cost him dearly against Shabbir Ahmed. Playing across the line to an off-cutter, his off stump was exposed, and he was gone for 43.\n\nWith that, the West Indian innings imploded. Tight bowling frustrated Sarwan and the new batsman, Runako Morton, leading to Sarwan's run out – and when Morton finally found his footing, skipper Chanderpaul was run out for 3. After 25 overs, West Indies were 114 for 4 – with the relative inexperience of Runako Morton and Wavell Hinds at the crease. However, they were 13 ahead of Pakistan's score at the time. It was not to be, though – Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik frustrated them with spin, tying down the run rate, and eventually Afridi deceived the both of them – Morton with a slower ball that he attempted a big heave off, and Hinds with a clever googly. With Bravo looking clueless and gone for a duck, West Indies at one point needed 43 off 18 balls – a hopeless proposition. Shoaib Malik was Man of the Match, despite what many saw as being somewhat shaky at the crease for his 51 and not taking any wickets – some would have argued the case for Inzamam-ul-Haq, who made 51 as well, at a quicker rate, and was injured while batting.\n\n3rd ODI, 22 May 2005\nPakistan put in a second-string line-up in the third ODI, knowing that they had already won the series – opener Yasir Hameed came in for Salman Butt, Bazid Khan for a sore Inzamam-ul-Haq and off-spinner Arshad Khan for Iftikhar Anjum. Opener Xavier Marshall and fast bowler Daren Powell was dropped by the West Indies, young batsman Dwayne Smith and seam bowler Pedro Collins taking their places. However, the changes didn't matter much – Pakistan still won, although in a more relaxed fashion than the first two matches.\n\nAfter early consolidation by Pakistan, with only the odd boundary from Shahid Afridi, the opener pair of Afridi and Yasir Hameed let the West Indies have it. Afridi lifted some massive drives over cover, leaving Pakistan 78 for 0 after ten overs. Yasir Hameed then added another couple of boundaries before hitting a single to leave Afridi on strike. A leg flick from Afridi two balls later saw him well caught by Dwayne Bravo off the bowling of Corey Collymore – out for 56 off 30 balls, but Pakistan were still 87 for 1 after 11 overs. The loss of the wicket stopped Pakistan somewhat, though, as Yasir Hameed didn't seem to have quite good enough control of the seam bowlers Collymore and Ian Bradshaw. They scored twenty off the next thirty-nine balls, Collins and Collymore tying them down enough before Hameed gave an edge that was caught by West Indian keeper Courtney Browne. However, Bazid Khan rebuilt with Yousuf Youhana, pairing up for 96 for the third wicket before Youhana was out caught off the medium pace of Wavell Hinds for 50. Younis Khan (40) and Abdul Razzaq (18) played quick knocks with many quick singles, and the cameo ended with Kamran Akmal, the young wicketkeeper, smacking three sixes off Ian Bradshaw to end with 24 not out off 9 balls. Bradshaw, despite taking two wickets and bowling a maiden over, conceded 78 runs from his ten overs, but all the West Indian bowlers were hit around as Pakistan notched up 303 for 6. Shoaib Malik – the usual number three – did not bat.\n\nSlow accumulation was the word for the West Indian openers Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds, as they were tied down by the Pakistani bowlers – as usual in this series. After ten overs, West Indies were 32 for 0, and needed nearly seven runs an over to win it. Chris Gayle realised the danger, and being gifted a no-ball by Naved-ul-Hasan, he slammed that over for 20 runs to bring the West Indians back on track. Things got more interesting when Wavell Hinds inside edged a pull shot off Abdur Razzaq to the Pakistani wicket-keeper, the score 90 for 1 after 16 overs. Two overs later, the new batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan tried to drive Abdur Razzaq over cover, but Younis Khan took an excellent catch, and many wondered whether the West Indies were about to see another collapse. However, captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul, struggling for form so far in the series, rebuilt well – and even bringing on Shahid Afridi, who had been devastating with the ball so far in the series, had little effect. At the end of 25 overs, the West Indies were 136 for 2, four ahead of the Pakistani score at the same time. \n\nThe West Indians didn't quite get the hang of the spinners, though, and eventually Shoaib Malik got Chanderpaul out caught for 33 – a solid innings from the captain, but he left the team in a struggling position. After that, the spinners tied the West Indians down, along with Gayle suffering from nervous nineties – although he did get his century, it was off 120 balls. With ten overs remaining, Runako Morton finally got his eye in – it was required, as the West Indians needed one hundred runs with seven wickets in hand. They did try – almost a bit too hard, because Morton was caught in the deep by Shabbir Ahmed off the bowling of Shoaib Malik for 27. The new batsman, Dwayne Smith, was gone in the next over, trying to hit across the line to Abdul Razzaq and judged lbw – ending with 0 off 3 balls, exactly what the hosts did not need. Razzaq got his third wicket with that ball, but gave away a few runs to Gayle and the new batsman Dwayne Bravo. Runs came to the new batsman Dwayne Bravo, but never enough to sustain the required rate of eleven per over, and trying to up the rate Chris Gayle launched another drive to cover fielder Younis Khan – out for a great 124, his eleventh one-day century. The new batsman, Courtney Browne, had smacked 39 off 27 balls in the last ODI, and continued in that vein today – smashing an expansive drive over extra cover for the West Indies' first six of the day, giving them some hope. However, with four overs remaining, there were still 43 runs to be hit. The pressure became too great for Dwayne Bravo, as he failed to read Naved-ul-Hasan's slower ball and was clean bowled for 16. That stopped the West Indies effectively, and their innings petered out to 281 all out as Browne (11), Collins (0), and Bradshaw (13) all became prey to the Pakistani bowlers.\n\n1st Test, 26 May 2005 – 29 May 2005\nA weakened Pakistan without Inzamam-ul-Haq (banned), Shoaib Malik (banned) and Yousuf Youhana (a sick father) went in with a bat-heavy team, with five pure batsmen and two all-rounders plus the wicketkeeper against a West Indies team who could field a first-choice eleven – only lacking all-rounder Dwayne Bravo. Nevertheless, Pakistan went in as favourites in most people's eyes, only to go down in spectacular fashion. The West Indians won the toss, and chose to bat first, nearly regretting it as they lost an out-of-form Chris Gayle early on as he was caught in close by Abdul Razzaq off Shabbir Ahmed. Three overs later, Devon Smith – West Indies' other opener – was let off by Test debutant Bazid Khan who fielded at second slip, as he couldn't react to a ball that came towards his stomach. However, Bazid Khan kept his nerve a bit later when he held an edge from the man at the other end, Ramnaresh Sarwan, who was outdone by an away-swinger from Shabbir Ahmed, reducing West Indies to 25 for 2. After a bit of a steady period, where Brian Lara in particular looked in control of the bowlers, another catch went to slip as Yasir Hameed could take the edge off Devon Smith's bat for 19. At lunch, however, Lara (44*) and Chanderpaul (14*) had restored some honour for the West Indies, lifting them to 102 for 3 on what looked like a fast outfield. The two continued after tea, Shabbir Ahmed sending down a particularly poor over with three no-balls, three boundaries and a run four, and Brian Lara eventually raced to a magnificent 130 off 120 balls, with 16 fours and four sixes before being bowled attempting a cover drive. Down the order, Wavell Hinds contributed with 28, wicketkeeper Courtney Browne made 12, and Daren Powell made 10, but Pakistan also served up 24 no-balls to help the West Indian cause. Two wickets with four balls – Powell and Chanderpaul (caught at cover for 92) marked the end of the West Indian fight-back, however, in what shaped up to be an excellent game of Test cricket. With King and Edwards both gone for 3, West Indies were all out for 345.\n\nShahid Afridi then started in the usual way, smacking a six over midwicket with his eighth ball, although Daren Powell bowled well and Fidel Edwards with considerable pace. However, nothing more specific happened, apart from Edwards notching up a 94 mph (151 km/h) delivery, and Pakistan went to stumps on day 1 with 22 for no loss, the match evenly balanced. The second day's cricket was moderately entertaining, though, especially for a crowd that had despaired over the West Indians' poor performance all summer. The 23-year-old Edwards bowled with reasonable accuracy, and although the Pakistanis helped him with some poorly chosen shots, which meant that wickets fell all too regularly. Shahid Afridi was first out, unsurprisingly, edging an outswinger to slip, and the embarrassment continued with no batsman reaching more than Younis Khan's 31. However, Younis's innings was marred by the way he got out. Coming out after lunch with the score 96 for 5, he attempted a pull shot off Edwards' bowling, but mistimed it and ended up with an easy edge to Corey Collymore at midwicket. In short, Pakistan never seemed to take in the dire situation they were actually in, and eventually were all out for 144 – trailing by 201, two short of the follow-on target. However, Shiv Chanderpaul decided to have another go at batting – owing in part to Fidel Edwards' injury and also to the fear of a big come-back, and he decided to send his openers in. It worked well against the new-ball bowlers Naved-ul-Hasan and Shabbir Ahmed, as the West Indies scored 59 for no loss in 16 overs, but Abdul Razzaq precipitated a mini-collapse when he got Devon Smith caught behind for 10. Two overs later, West Indies were 65 for 3, Ramnaresh Sarwan out for 1 and Chris Gayle gone for 50. It could, in fact, have been 65 for 4, had Chanderpaul not been lucky first ball – it was a poor inside-edge that landed between the off stump and the wicketkeeper. However, the West Indies recovered, with Lara making another good score of 48 before missing a drive and being stumped off Shahid Afridi. However, the West Indies were in control at the end of day 2, leading by 369 runs and with 6 wickets in hand.\n\nThe West Indies to push onwards on day three. Wavell Hinds, 28 not out overnight, batted well with captain Chanderpaul to add a further 103 runs before lunch – when Hinds was bowled by Kaneria. The new batsman, wicketkeeper Courtney Browne, only lasted three overs before edging to the young Pakistani keeper Kamran Akmal, who eventually held the catch for 1. Daren Powell, however, hung on with Chanderpaul for long enough that the captain could reach his century, his first against Pakistan and his fourteenth Test ton overall – making 5. Fidel Edwards then made a quickfire 20, Reon King 5 and Corey Collymore a duck, leaving Chanderpaul stranded on 153 not out – his second highest score in Test cricket. However, that was enough to lift the West Indies to 371 – setting Pakistan the highest target in the West Indies since 1930, and the highest in world cricket for 25 years, as they required 572 to win the game.\n\nPakistan, however, got the worst imaginable start. Three balls into the innings, Fidel Edwards served up a ball that Salman Butt felt he had to play at; he came down the ground, edged it, and a beautiful catch from Chris Gayle resulted in Pakistan being one down without scoring a run. Despite Edwards leaving the field an over later, West Indies put on the pressure, and Yasir Hameed and Younis Khan misunderstood each other to cause a run out. Then, Yasir Hameed gave a regulation outside edge to Courtney Browne, who said thank you and held the ball in his gloves as Pakistan were 16 for three after just over five overs – and with Asim Kamal (10 Tests) and Bazid Khan (debutant) at the crease. Luckily for Pakistan, rain intervened, but when the players came back, Corey Collymore bowled a beautiful inswinger that hit Bazid Khan sharply on the pads, and the umpire easily gave him out. 47 for 4, and despite Asim Kamal and Shahid Afridi giving them quick runs – aided by the West Indians giving up a few no-balls – they got to stumps without losing a further wicket, with the score up to 113 for 4. \n\nThe fourth day was dominated by one man – Shahid Afridi. With the West Indies lacking the sting of Fidel Edwards' pace, their bowlers were smacked to all corners by the violent Afridi, who brought up his third Test century off 78 balls – the second fastest in this century – and despite Asim Kamal going for 55 off the bowling of Gayle, there were genuine, if misguided, hopes that Pakistan would win the match. However, those hopes were dashed when Afridi lofted a massive drive straight to captain Chanderpaul – meaning that Pakistan would still need 299 runs for the last four wickets. There was never any threat, and when Abdul Razzaq went for 41 – stumped off the bowling of Chris Gayle after a call that went to the TV umpire – three overs after lunch, the question became how big the win would become. With Chris Gayle removing both Kamran Akmal (bowled for 21) and Danish Kaneria (caught behind for 0) within the space of three balls, West Indies ended up with a surprising 276-run victory.\n\n2nd Test, 2 June 2005 – 6 June 2005\nThe second Test between Pakistan and West Indies, at Kingston in Jamaica, was much more closely contested, but the return of Inzamam-ul-Haq and second-innings ducks for Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul decided the match – and squared the Test series. Pakistan was strengthened by the return of Inzamam-ul-Haq, who came in for Bazid Khan, and also exchanged Shoaib Malik for Salman Butt, while West Indies lacked an injured Fidel Edwards – top wicket taker for the West Indies in the last game – who was replaced by fellow fast bowler Tino Best. Best made his debut in the series, a rather uninspiring one, although he did take four wickets in a frantic spell on the morning of the fourth day.\n\nThe visitors won the toss, and batted first, losing Yasir Hameed as he gave a regulation edge to first slip Gayle off the bowling of Powell. Fellow opener Shoaib Malik lasted for much longer, pairing up with Younis Khan for 27, but looked uncertain at the crease and it was no surprise when he departed for 13. Some inconsistent bowling, particularly from Reon King, and fielding lapses gave Pakistan's star batsmen Younis and Inzamam the edge, however, as they smashed 97 runs in twenty overs with Inzamam doing the brunt of the damage with a 60-ball fifty. A straight ball from Chris Gayle undid him, however, but Asim Kamal continued the work that Younis and Inzamam had started as they fluently and easily brought up 200. Younis eventually got a century, finishing on 106, but Collymore was the pick of the afternoon session – he took three wickets, those of Younis, Asim Kamal and Shahid Afridi, as he had a real workhorse's afternoon and bowled tempting balls that beat the outside edge of the bat numerous times. It could have been even better for the West Indies, had not Tino Best been no-balled when he had Kamran Akmal caught behind, but the first day gave Pakistan the edge as they made 336 for 6.\n\nSix balls into the morning session, Abdul Razzaq was lbw to Corey Collymore, and the West Indians in the crowd hoped for a quick finish. Far from it, as Kamran Akmal and Naved-ul-Hasan added 19 before Naved-ul-Hasan was forced to retire with a smashed hand. That gave the West Indies some hope, as they wrapped up the innings ten overs into the morning session, but those 38 runs conceded could have proven costly. The West Indian reply was anything but cautious, as Chris Gayle started the innings with smashing three fours off the injured Naved-ul-Hasan, who bowled six overs for fifty runs on the day – he was taken off after two overs for 22 with the new ball, then bowled another spell of four overs for 28. They raced to 48 for 0 before Gayle was tricked by an away-swinger from Abdul Razzaq, giving an outside edge to Kamran Akmal. Devon Smith and Ramnaresh Sarwan slowed down, scoring only 11 before Devon Smith was out to a grubber from Abdul Razzaq, so the innings was finely poised at 59 for 2. The new batsman Brian Lara used the time to get his eye in, knowing that the game had gone along a bit too quickly. \n\nHowever, after lunch it was time to open things. Lara smashed runs at a run-a-ball, as the score went from 100 to 200 with 142 Pakistani deliveries, and although Pakistan wrested back some of the initiative with the wicket of Sarwan for 55, it was the West Indians' day. Shiv Chanderpaul hung on with Lara for the fourth wicket, as the pair added 70 in 23.4 overs – but a googly from Danish Kaneria resulted in a thin edge from Chanderpaul, who was out for 28. Thus, the West Indies went to stumps with 275 for 4, Lara unbeaten on 125. The West Indians continued on day 3, wishing to get up a big lead in fairly short time, and getting punished by Shabbir Ahmed – who ripped out Lara (for 153), Courtney Browne (for 0) and Daren Powell (for 14) – all caught behind. Wavell Hinds' fine 63, however, lifted the West Indians to 404 and a lead of 30, but Pakistan had done well to come back from 326 for 4. After the innings break, Pakistan started well, accumulating runs against unthreatening bowling from Powell and Best, but the untiring Collymore came back and had Yasir Hameed caught at slip for 26, although admittedly not with the best of deliveries. Shoaib Malik and Younis Khan continued, however, Malik notching up 64 runs before giving an inside edge off Collymore to Browne, and Collymore was also responsible for the third wicket, Asim Kamal missing a straight one for 0. Then, Courtney Browne dropped Inzamam early on – a mistake that would prove costly, as he went on to make 104 not out, in good partnerships with Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi, as Pakistan moved to 223 for 4 at stumps and wrested control of the game. \n\nAfridi and Inzamam added a further 44 runs for the fifth wicket before Pakistan decided to implode. Tino Best, returning after an opening spell of 5–0–30–0, got Shahid Afridi with his first delivery of the day, edging to Dwayne Smith. In his next over, he served up a beautiful inswinger that had Abdul Razzaq beaten completely, and the ball trickled onto his stumps. And before anyone noticed what had happened, Pakistan had lost five wickets for 28 runs, and Best had figures of 6–1–9–4 in his spell. Inzamam and Danish Kaneria saw it through to lunch, but shortly afterwards, Collymore served up a short ball to the tail-ender Kaneria, who supplied with an edge through to a diving Chris Gayle. Pakistan were all out for 309, setting the West Indies a target of 280 in five sessions – meaning that the match would definitely give a result.\n\nOn a pitch that slowly deteriorated, the chase would be interesting, and it became even more interesting when Chris Gayle edged a short-ball from Shabbir Ahmed to Yasir Hameed at slips, resulting in 27 for 1. Sarwan and Devon Smith recuperated, taking the chase to 38 for 1, before clouds shaded the light from the sun and the batsmen had to go off for poor light. Coming back after a two-hour break, Devon Smith immediately started to hit runs, but Sarwan looked more uncertain as he was possibly caught behind off Kaneria. Three balls later, he became the first West Indies batsman out hit wicket in over two years since Carlton Baugh managed it against Australia, as he stepped backwards to turn a short ball from Kaneria to leg but stepped too far. Then, Pakistan wrested the initiative when Brian Lara – the man who had made 155 earlier on – gave an edge to a ball from Kaneria that spun into him, out for a duck and the West Indies were 48 for 3. The next over from Shabbir Ahmed, however, yielded eight runs before light was again offered to the batsmen. Coming back, West Indies longed for a big partnership, but it was not to be – Kaneria got his third wicket of the day, with a ball that hit low and was given lbw by the umpire, resulting in 56 for 4, with still 224 runs required. It looked hopeless – however, Wavell Hinds, with no respect for Kaneria's figures of 5–1–6–3, smashed him for two fours in an over, as the West Indies plundered him for eleven runs and made the match more interesting for the spectators at least. Hinds and Smith looked to see it through to stumps, adding 38 runs in a little over 12 overs, but when Devon Smith edged a quicker ball from Kaneria through to Karman Akmal for his eighth catch of the Test and Kaneria's fourth wicket of the innings, all looked truly lost. Wavell Hinds also departed before the day ended, edging a wide ball from Abdul Razzaq, and with the score 114 for 6 overnight, everyone just expected the West Indies to meekly roll over, and that they did – losing three wickets within the space of seven balls as Powell, Browne and King were out in succession. Four overs later, Tino Best tried a massive drive off Shabbir Ahmed, and was easily out as Shahid Afridi took the final catch of the game to secure a Pakistan 136-run win. Strangely enough, Pakistan only made use of three bowlers in the second innings, as Naved-ul-Hasan was injured and Shahid Afridi banned for stepping on the pitch.\n\n"}
{"id": "1914921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914921", "title": "Holarctic", "text": "Holarctic\n\nThe Holarctic is the name for the biogeographic realm that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combiningWallace's Palearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North Africa and all of Eurasia (with the exception of the southern Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent), and the Nearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North America, north of Mexico. These regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic realm.\n\nWithin the Holarctic realm, there are a variety of ecosystems. The type of ecosystem found in an area depends on the latitude and local geography. In the far north, a band of arctic tundra circles the shore of the Arctic Ocean. The ground beneath this land is permafrost, frozen year-round. In these difficult growing conditions, few plants can survive. South of the tundra, the boreal forest stretches across North America and Eurasia. This land is characterized by coniferous trees. South of here, the ecosystems become more diverse. Some areas are covered in temperate grassland, while others are covered in temperate forest, dominated by deciduous trees. The southern extent of the Holarctic typically reaches into the desert, which is dominated by plants and animals adapted to the dry conditions (Schultz 2007).\n\nA variety of animal species are distributed across continents, throughout much of the Holarctic realm. These include the brown bear, grey wolf, red fox, wolverine, moose, caribou, golden eagle and common raven.\n\nThe brown bear (\"Ursus arctos\") is found in mountainous and semi-open areas distributed throughout the Holarctic. It once occupied much larger areas, but has been driven out by human development and the resulting habitat fragmentation. Today it is only found in remaining wilderness areas.\n\nThe grey wolf (\"Canis lupus\") is found in a wide variety of habitats from tundra to desert, with different populations adapted for each. Its historical distribution encompasses the vast majority of the Holarctic realm, though human activities such as development and active extermination have extirpated the species from much of this range.\n\nThe red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes\") is a highly adaptable predator. It has the widest distribution of any terrestrial carnivore, and is adapted to a wide range of habitats, including areas of intense human development. Like the wolf, it is distributed throughout the majority of the Holarctic, but it has avoided extirpation.\n\nThe wolverine (\"Gulo gulo\") is a large member of the weasel family found primarily in the arctic and in boreal forests, ranging south in mountainous regions. It is distributed in such areas throughout Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe moose (\"Alces alces\") is the largest member of the deer family. It is found throughout most of the boreal forest through continental Eurasia into Scandinavia, eastern North America, and boreal and montane regions of western North America. In some areas it ranges south into the deciduous forest. \nThe caribou, or reindeer (\"Rangifer tarandus\") is found in boreal forest and tundra in the northern parts of the Holarctic. In Eurasia it has been domesticated. It is divided into several subspecies, which are adapted to different habitats and geographic areas.\n\nThe golden eagle (\"Aquila chrysaetos\") is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).\n\nThe common raven (\"Corvus corax\") is the most widespread of the corvids, and one of the largest. It is found in a variety of habitats, but primarily wooded northern areas. It has been known to adapt well to areas of human activity. Their distribution also makes up most of the Holarctic realm.\n\n\"Leptothorax acervorum\" is a small red holarctic ant widely distributed across Eurasia, ranging from central Spain and Italy to the northernmost parts of Scandinavia and Siberia.\n\nThe continuity of the northern parts of the holarctic results from their shared glacial history. During the Pleistocene, these areas were subjected to repeated glaciations. Icecaps expanded, scouring the land of life and reshaping its topography. During glacial periods, species survived in refugia, small areas that maintained a suitable climate due to local geography. These areas are believed to have been primarily in southern regions, but some genetic and paleontological evidence points to additional refugia in the sheltered areas of the north (Stewart and Lister 2001).\n\nWherever these areas were found, they became source populations during interglacial periods. When the glaciers receded, plants and animals spread rapidly into the newly opened areas. Different taxa responded to these rapidly changing conditions in different ways. Tree species spread outward from refugia during interglacial periods, but in varied patterns, with different trees dominating in different periods (Taberlet and Chedadi 2002). Insects, on the other hand, shifted their ranges with the climate, maintaining consistency in species for the most part throughout the period (Coope 1994). Their high degree of mobility allowed them to move as the glaciers advanced or retreated, maintaining a constant habitat despite the climatic oscillations. Despite their apparent lack of mobility, plants managed to colonize new areas rapidly as well. Studies of fossil pollen indicate that trees recolonized these lands at an exponential rate (Bennet 1986). Mammals recolonized at varying rates. Brown bears, for instance, moved quickly from refugia with the receding glaciers, becoming one of the first large mammals to recolonize the land (Sommer and Benecke 2005). The last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago, resulting in the present distribution of ecoregions.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the continuity of Holarctic ecosystems is the movement between continents allowed by the Bering land bridge, which was exposed by the lowering of sea level due to the expansion of the ice caps. The communities found in the Palearctic and the Nearctic are different, but have many species in common. This is the result of several faunal interchanges that took place across the Bering land bridge. However, these migrations were mostly limited to large, cold-tolerant species (Rodriguez et al. 2006). Today it is mainly these species which are found throughout the realm.\n\nAs the Holarctic is an enormous area, it is subject to environmental problems of international scale. The primary threats throughout the region result from global warming and habitat fragmentation. The former is of particular concern in the north, as these ecosystems are adapted to cold. The latter is more of a concern in the south, where development is prevalent.\n\nGlobal warming is a threat to all the Earth's ecosystems, but it is a more immediate threat to those found in cold climates. The communities of species found at these latitudes are adapted to the cold, so any significant warming can upset the balance. For instance, insects struggle to survive the cold winters typical of the boreal forest. Many do not make it, especially in harsh winters. However, recently the winters have grown milder, which has had a drastic effect on the forest. Winter mortality of some insect species drastically decreased, allowing the population to build on itself in subsequent years. In some areas the effects have been severe. Spruce beetle outbreaks have wiped out up to ninety percent of the Kenai Peninsula's spruce trees; this is blamed primarily on a series of unusually warm years since 1987 (Logan et al. 2003).\n\nIn this case a native species has caused massive disturbance of habitat as a result of climate change. Warming temperatures may also allow pest species to enlarge their range, moving into habitats that were previously unsuitable. Studies of potential areas for outbreaks of bark beetles indicate that as the climate shifts, these beetles will expand to the north and to higher elevations than they have previously affected (Williams & Liebhold 2002). With warmer temperatures, insect infestation will become a greater problem throughout the northern parts of the Holarctic.\n\nAnother potential effect of global warming to norther ecosystems is the melting of permafrost. This can have significant effects on the plant communities that are adapted to the frozen soil, and may also have implications for further climate change. As permafrost melts, any trees growing above it may die, and the land shifts from forest to peatland. In the far north, shrubs may later take over what was formerly tundra. The precise effect depends on whether the water that was locked up is able to drain off. In either case, the habitat will undergo a shift. Melting permafrost may also accelerate climate change in the future. Within the permafrost, vast quantities of carbon are locked up. If this soil melts, the carbon may be released into the air as either carbon dioxide or methane. Both of these are greenhouse gases (Stokstad 2004).\n\nHabitat fragmentation threatens a wide variety of habitats throughout the world, and the Holarctic is no exception. Fragmentation has a variety of negative effects on populations. As populations become cut off, their genetic diversity suffers and they become susceptible to sudden disasters and extinction. While the northern parts of the Holarctic represent some of the largest areas of wilderness left on Earth, the southern parts are in some places extensively developed. This realm contains most of the worlds developed countries, including the United States and the nations of Western Europe. Temperate forests were the primary ecosystem in many of the most developed areas today. These lands are now used for intensive agriculture or have become urbanized. As lands have been developed for agricultural uses and human occupation, natural habitat has for the most part become limited to areas considered unsuitable for human use, such as slopes or rocky areas (Schultz 2007). This pattern of development limits the ability of animals, especially large ones, to migrate from place to place.\n\nLarge carnivores are particularly affected by habitat fragmentation. These mammals, such as brown bears and wolves, require large areas of land with relatively intact habitat to survive as individuals. Much larger areas are required to maintain a sustainable population. They may also serve as keystone species, regulating the populations of the species they prey on. Thus, their conservation has direct implications for a wide range of species, and is difficult to accomplish politically due to the large size of the areas they need (Paquet 1996). With increasing development, these species in particular are at risk, which could have effects that carry down throughout the ecosystem.\n\nThe threats to the Holarctic realm are not going unrecognized. Many efforts are being made to mitigate these threats, with the hope of preserving the biodiversity of the region. International agreements to combat global warming may help to lessen the effects of climate change on this region. Efforts are also underway to fight habitat fragmentation, both on local and regional scales.\n\nThe most comprehensive effort to combat global warming to date is the Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries who sign this protocol agree to cut their collective greenhouse gas emissions by five percent since 1990 by sometime between 2008 and 2012. The vast majority of these nations are found within the Holarctic. Each country is given a target for emission levels, and they may trade emissions credits in a market-based system that includes developing countries as well. Once this period is ended, a new agreement will be written to further mitigate the effects of climate change. The process of drafting a new agreement has already begun. In late 2007, an international meeting in Bali was held to begin planning for the successor to the Kyoto Protocol. This agreement will aim to build on the successes and failures of Kyoto to produce a more effective method of cutting greenhouse gas emissions (UNFCCC). If these efforts are successful, the biodiversity of the Holarctic and the rest of the world will see fewer effects of climate change.\n\nFighting habitat fragmentation is a major challenge in conserving the wide-ranging species of the Holarctic. Some efforts are limited to a local scale of protection, while others are regional in scope. Local efforts include creating reserves and establishing safe routes for animals to cross roads and other human-made barriers. Regional efforts to combat habitat fragmentation take a broader scope.\n\nOne major such effort in the Holarctic is the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. This organization was started in 1997 to help establish a contiguous network of protection for the northern Rocky Mountains, from mid Wyoming to the border between Alaska and Canada's Yukon. It brings together a wide variety of environmental organizations for a shared purpose. The goal of the Initiative is to create a core of protected areas, connected by corridors and surrounded by buffer zones. This will build on the many existing protected areas in this region, with a focus on integrating existing and future human activities into the conservation plan rather than seeking to exclude them (Yellowstone to Yukon). If these efforts are successful, they will be especially beneficial to wide-ranging species such as grizzly bears. If these species can survive, other members of the communities they live in will survive as well.\n\n"}

He served as the keeper (1919–30), then director (1930–48), of the National Galleries of Scotland, and as HM Limner and Painter in Scotland (1948–76).\n\nHe was born at 15 East Road in Kirkwall, Orkney the son of J Scott Cursiter.\n\nHe was educated at Kirkwall Grammar School before moving to Edinburgh, where he studied at Edinburgh College of Art. His early paintings were influenced by cubism, futurism and vorticism. From an early age, he clearly had access to great wealth as his accommodation from 1910 is listed as 28 Queen Street, one of the most prestigious addresses in Edinburgh, and not affordable to the average art student.\n\nDuring First World War he served as an officer in 1st Battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and served in The Battle of the Somme, Amiens and Abbeville. The conditions in the trenches brought on bronchitis and asthma, and he was invalided out to convalesce in the South of France. After recuperating, he returned to the Battalion's base, but was once again hospitalised and in danger of becoming 'unfit for service'. However he managed to continue service by transferring to the 4th Field Ordnance Survey Battalion at 4th Army Headquarters and developed new and faster methods for processing aerial photographs. In particular, he devised a clever method of projecting the photographic negative taken from a spotter plane which replicated the tilt present when the photograph was taken – the technique of single photo-optical rectification. This greatly speeded up the process of rapid fixing of enemy gun emplacements. During the War, he also learned to use radio (becoming President of the Edinburgh Radio Society). He was Mentioned in Dispatches twice and received a military OBE. During the Second World War he initially worked at the Ordnance Survey Department in Southampton (1939–40) and then moved to the same organisation in Edinburgh (1940–1945). He received a military CBE in 1948.\n\nAfter the First World War he adopted a more realist style.\n\nCursiter became an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1927, a full Academician in 1937 and served as Secretary to the Academy from 1953 to 1955. He was the first Secretary of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland and was appointed Keeper of the National Galleries of Scotland in 1930, a post he held until 1948. That same year, he was granted the Freedom of Kirkwall and was appointed as the King's (later to be Queen's) Painter and Limner for Scotland, a position he held until his death.\n\nHe painted watercolour landscapes of East Lothian, Orkney and Shetland, and designed Saint Rognvald Chapel in St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. He is particularly renowned for his portraits and is considered amongst the finest Scottish portraitists of the 20th Century. He painted 'Her Majesty The Queen receiving the Honours of Scotland' in the High Kirk of St Giles in 1953, this painting hangs on the Great Stair, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh.\n\nAberdeen University awarded him an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1959. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1938, a rare accolade for an artist. His proposers were James Pickering Kendall, Leonard Dobbin, James Watt, and Sir Ernest Wedderburn.\n\nCursiter was influential in the campaign to create a Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.\n\nHe died in Stromness in 1976.\n\nHe married Phylliss Hourston in 1910.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1914940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914940", "title": "WLTW", "text": "WLTW\n\nWLTW (106.7 FM, \"106.7 Lite FM\") is an adult contemporary radio station licensed to New York City and serving the New York metropolitan area. WLTW is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts from studios in the former AT&T Building in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan; its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.\n\nThe station first went on the air on January 1, 1961 as WRVR, originally owned by the Riverside Church. WRVR played classical music and some jazz, along with religious programming and public affairs. As time went on, WRVR was a full-time jazz station with a strong audience following but low ratings.\n\nIn mid-1974 Riverside Church looked to cut its losses and sell WRVR, but with a preferred condition that the station's jazz format be preserved. At the same time, classical music-formatted WNCN (104.3 FM, now sister station WAXQ) was in the process of a controversial format change to Album oriented rock, with new call letters WQIV. A group of WNCN audience members formed the non-profit WNCN Listeners Guild and attempted to block the station's then-owner, Starr Broadcasting, from making the format switch. After their efforts failed, the WNCN Listeners Guild partnered with GAF Corporation and briefly entered negotiations with Riverside Church to purchase WRVR and switch its programming to classical. The rock format on 104.3 FM would last less than a year, as GAF announced it would purchase WQIV in July 1975 and restore 104.3 FM to its former call sign and programming.\n\nAs the WNCN/WQIV drama concluded, Sonderling Broadcasting stepped in and bought WRVR from Riverside Church for just over $2 million. Sonderling already owned WWRL (1600 AM), and hoped that it could move WWRL's Urban contemporary format to FM as a counter-move against WBLS (107.5 FM), which had cut into WWRL's ratings. Like the WNCN/WQIV situation, community opposition tried to stop sale of the station. Sonderling ultimately took control of WRVR in October 1976 after over a year of delays. The listeners' protests did prevent the proposed change, and WRVR remained a jazz station under Sonderling ownership. At that time it developed the precursor to what would later become known as the \"smooth jazz\" format. While it played Jazz music, it was allowed to report to Radio & Records Album Oriented Rock chart in the mid to late 1970s.\n\nIn 1978 Viacom announced it was purchasing the Sonderling chain, a sale which took a year-and-a-half to become final. When Viacom took over in 1980, the call letters were changed to WKHK and the station adopted a country music format known as \"Kick 106.7 FM\". The format change took place in the middle of the night and brought many protests from New York jazz fans, who petitioned the FCC to deny the station's license renewal; ultimately the petition was denied. WKHK would suffer from low ratings, as they were unable to compete with WHN (1050 AM), which also had a country music format at the time.\n\nOn January 23, 1984, Viacom dropped country music and turned 106.7 into an MOR station–with new call letters WLTW and on-air branding of \"Lite FM\". Initially they were an easy listening station without anything that would be classified as \"elevator music\". At this point, the station played music from such artists as Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Kenny Rogers, Tony Bennett, Andy Williams, Barry Manilow, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor, and the Stylistics. The station also played softer songs from such artists as Elton John, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Everly Brothers, the Righteous Brothers and Billy Joel. The station wouldn't play any new music except for new songs by artists that were familiar to listeners of the station. With this format change, ratings did increase from its previously low levels.\n\nBy the late 1980s, WLTW started to play songs from such artists as Whitney Houston, Chicago, Foreigner, the Doobie Brothers and Bruce Springsteen. As other competing New York City stations changed their focus, the station stayed with their soft adult contemporary format, even though they were phasing out songs from artists such as Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow, and the Carpenters. At this point, the station's ratings were at or near the top compared with other New York City radio stations.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, with WPAT-FM adapting a Spanish adult contemporary format, WPLJ adapting a hot adult contemporary format, and WMXV switching to a modern adult contemporary format, WLTW segued to a mainstream adult contemporary format with a more uptempo direction than before, and phased out the majority of its soft adult contemporary material.\n\nChancellor bought WLTW and the rest of Viacom's radio group in 1997. In 1999 Chancellor merged with Capstar to form AM/FM, which retained WLTW. Finally, in 2000, AM/FM merged with Clear Channel Communications, which became iHeartMedia in 2014. (Of note, Viacom would not be out of the radio business for long, for when they bought CBS, they also bought their radio properties, which were owned by the radio subsidiary Infinity Broadcasting - which owned WLTW's future competitor, WNEW-FM.)\n\nWLTW was simulcast nationwide on XM Satellite Radio from 2001 to the end of 2003, under the channel name \"Lite.\" WLTW on XM was replaced by The Blend on February 2, 2004. In 2004, all XM music channels went commercial free, and WLTW was replaced with a unique-to-XM channel called Sunny, which had an easy listening format. Since then, Clear Channel has regained the right to air commercials on their XM music channels. Sunny then began carrying commercials, but was still exclusive to XM. After a few format tweaks, Sunny played soft oldies until it became The Pink Channel.\n\nDuring the holiday season (Thanksgiving through Christmas), WLTW has played Christmas music interspersed with its regular playlist. Only on Christmas Day and a few days leading up to it would the station devote all its airtime to holiday music. After the September 11 attacks, Christmas music was seen as a comforting \"feel-good\" format for radio listeners. Already established as a popular station for Christmas music, WLTW began to switch to an all-Christmas format earlier in 2002. After retaining its leadership in market share, and as part of a national trend, the station continued to make the switch earlier in the following years. By 2004, the all-Christmas format ran from Thanksgiving through Christmas, and in 2005, it began on November 18, the week before Thanksgiving (November 24). By all accounts, the gamble paid off; WLTW captured 7.4% of the New York radio audience during the fall of 2005—the biggest market share in WLTW's history and the highest share for all New York stations since the winter of 1995. On November 18, 2006, for the 2nd year in a row the station switched to all Christmas music on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, becoming the first NYC Station to do so. They did so the same day as WALK-FM, a Long Island-based station which shares a good portion of their listening audience. At some points during the 2008 holiday season, WLTW would draw as much as a third of all radio listeners in the New York area. \n\nWLTW usually switches to Christmas music on the Friday before Thanksgiving, like it did in recent years. However, this did not occur in 2019, when the station decided to switch to Christmas music on November 15, instead of November 22, which was the Friday before Thanksgiving.\n\nAs part of Clear Channel's nationwide cost-cutting efforts, WLTW fired station veterans Bill Buchner (mornings) and J.J. Kennedy (evenings) on November 6, 2006. Buchner was replaced with Karen Carson, who co-hosted mornings with fellow WLTW staffer Christine Nagy. WLTW Program Director Jim Ryan has denied these firings were part of the company's cost cutting that were going on at all the other Clear Channel stations in preparation for their conversion the leveraged buyout that took the company from public to private ownership in 2006, but rather from their desire to improve ratings.\n\nThe syndicated Delilah show, distributed by sister company Premiere Radio Networks, replaced Kennedy's local evening lovesongs show on November 20, 2006, bringing the syndicated show to the full New York market for the first time. Prior to WLTW picking her show up, Delilah was only heard in outer portions of the New York market from stations in neighboring areas, such as WEZN-FM. In a departure from her normal format, Delilah and her syndicator are allowing Ryan to program the music on the WLTW's version of Delilah, instead of the selections that are sent to her other affiliates.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, just after April Fool's Day, WLTW removed the \"Lite\" branding and was simply known as \"New York's 106.7.\" This probably took place in reaction to the \"Lite\" brand being associated with an older demographic turning away the younger listeners, as well as increased competition from the new Fresh 102.7. Later in 2007, the Lite-FM branding returned on the station. This was true even though WLTW played \"Livin' on a Prayer\" by Bon Jovi and \"Crazy\" by Gnarls Barkley, just like with most AC stations today. By 2009, most of the hot AC content was toned down in order for competitor WWFS' (now WNEW-FM) shift from hot AC to adult contemporary. In 2011, WWFS switched panels to the hot adult contemporary panel from the adult contemporary panel on Nielsen BDS and later Mediabase, giving WWFS more format similarity to rival WPLJ (owned by Cumulus Media) rather than WLTW or its rimshot rivals (WNBM/WFAF, WKJY or WMGQ, the latter two on 98.3 FM).\n\nFurther cost-cutting efforts by Clear Channel caused the departure of longtime station favorites Al \"Bernie\" Berstein and Valerie Smaldone in early 2008. It was also announced that Program Director Jim Ryan would exit as of May 2008. Chris Conley took over the Program Director Position. Mr. Conley was a programming consultant with McVay Media and long time programming veteran with years in the Adult Contemporary radio format. Chris had a very successful tenure at WBEB B101 FM in Philadelphia. Recently, in addition to his programming duties at WLTW-FM, Mr. Conley has been overseeing programming at sister station WKTU The Beat Of New York. Ms. Morgan Prue, winner of several Music Director Of The Year Awards, stayed on as the station's Music Director and Assistant Program Director Upon Ms. Prue's departure, to pursue a program directorship in Canada, Ms. Jillian Kempton was named Assistant Program Director/Music Director. Jill is now the program director of sister station, in Washington DC, WASH-FM and Ms. Cara Hahn has stepped into the Assistant Program Director role, which she also holds at New York sister station WHTZ.\n\nLite FM has evolved into a more upbeat \"Variety\" station from its earlier \"Soft Rock\" approach with deejays talking over intros, keeping a non stop music flow, and has added a jingle package for the first time in the history of the station. The station uses Reelworld One AC with its own logo. The station is also well known for having somewhat of a lean toward Rhythmic AC compared to most other AC stations owned by Clear Channel, possibly due to the younger-leaning audience in the NY market.\n\nIn May 2011, WLTW returned to XM Satellite Radio, with a full-time simulcast on Channel 13. However, station owner Clear Channel sold off its ownership stake in Sirius XM Radio during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. As a result of the sale, nine of Clear Channel's eleven XM stations, including the simulcast of WLTW, ceased broadcast over XM Satellite Radio on October 18, 2013.\n\nA link to 106.7 FM's days as Riverside Church-owned WRVR remains on WLTW in the present day. A recorded sermon from Riverside Church airs on the station at 5:00 AM on Sunday mornings, as part of WLTW's non-music public affairs programming.\n\nAs a mainstream adult contemporary station, WLTW has historically been one of the top radio stations in New York City. In March 2012, the station finished first with a 7.5 share in the Nielsen Audio numbers, with WCBS-FM and WHTZ-FM finishing in second and third respectively.\n\nWLTW's audience also grows when it switches to Christmas music for the holiday season; in 2017, the station's ratings share increased to 8.8 at the beginning of the season, an increase of .5 year-over-year.\n"}
{"id": "1914942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914942", "title": "The Skyscrapers (wrestling)", "text": "The Skyscrapers (wrestling)\n\nThe Skyscrapers (or just Skyscrapers) were a professional wrestling tag team in World Championship Wrestling in 1989 and 1990 in three distinct forms with members ”Big” Sid Vicious, ”Dangerous” Dan Spivey, \"Mean\" Mark Callous with The Masked Skyscraper making a one night appearance.\n\nIn early 1989, Teddy Long was a referee for the National Wrestling Alliance, but due to a series of questionable calls, including one that cost the Road Warriors their world tag-team titles Teddy Long was fired and took up managing instead.\n\nLong paired Dan Spivey with Sid Vicious, two people who had recently signed with the federation and gave them the name “The Skyscrapers” due to their height.\n\nThe Skyscrapers’ first taste of success came at the 1989 Great American Bash PPV where they first co-won a Two-Ring King of the Hill Battle Royal with Sid being the survivor in one ring and Dan surviving in the other. The rules called for the two to fight each other but manager Teddy Long convinced them to shake hands and share the prize money before getting on the microphone and telling the crowd that what they had that the other tag teams didn't have was unity. Later in the night the Skyscrapers defeated The Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace and Shane Douglas) due to their overwhelming size and power.\n\nThe Skyscrapers quickly became involved in a feud with the Road Warriors, sparked by Teddy Long’s actions while still a referee. The two teams were very evenly matched in power and intensity creating a series of matches that did not favor one team over the other. Spivey and Vicious were disqualified against the Road Warriors at Halloween Havoc 1989 but neither team looked like losers on the night. Shortly after Halloween Havoc the Skyscrapers faced the Steiner Brothers at Clash of the Champions IX in a hard hitting match. A match that was so hard hitting in fact that Sid Vicious suffered a punctured lung due to a broken rib.\n\nWith Vicious out of action Teddy Long brought in another tall () newcomer in the same mold as Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey and dubbed him ”Mean” Mark Callous. The New Skyscrapers immediately picked up the feud with the Road Warriors and kept on having inconclusive matches with them. At Clash of the Champions X the Skyscrapers finally got the better of the Road Warriors, not in the match but afterwards when they beat the Road Warriors down. At this point in time no one had ever been able to physically dominate the Road Warriors, something that pointed that big things had been planned for the Skyscrapers. But big things never happened, in the days before the scheduled Chicago Street Fight at WrestleWar 1990 Dan Spivey suddenly left WCW leaving the bookers to scramble for a replacement. Exactly why he left the federation so suddenly has never been stated.\n\nInstead of cancelling the announced match the bookers turned to Mike Enos, who was working for the American Wrestling Association at the time, and put him under a mask as The Masked Skyscraper. The Road Warriors made short work of Callous and the Masked Skyscraper ending the feud and ending the Skyscrapers run of domination. Callous decided to go on his own for a while but failed in a challenge to WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger. He then quit and joined the WWF, where he became known as The Undertaker.\n\nBy the end of 1990 Dan Spivey and the WCW worked out whatever differences that caused Spivey to leave in the spring and Spivey returned to WCW television. The Skyscrapers briefly reunited at Starrcade 1990 as he and Sid Vicious took on and beat The Big Cat and The Motor City Madman. The match was the only time Spivey and Vicious teamed up to reform the original Sky-Scrapers\n\nIn the WWF/E, Sid Vicious and Mean Mark Callous feuded with each other several times; they would wrestle each other at WrestleMania 13 for the WWF Championship, with Sid Vicious as the WWF Champion Sycho Sid and Mean Mark Callous as The Undertaker, where The Undertaker won the match and the Championship.\n\nBefore becoming a Skyscraper, Spivey had wrestled as \"Golden Boy\" Danny Spivey in the WWF from 1985-88 in a gimmick where with his blonde hair, height and build, yellow trunks and yellow boots saw him labelled by fans as a clone of then WWF Champion Hulk Hogan. He returned to the WWF in 1995 under the name Waylon Mercy, this time with jet black hair, but was used as a jobber-to-the-stars and ended up retiring later in the year. In between his WCW stint and second WWF stint as Mercy he competed in All Japan Pro Wrestling, winning the World Tag Team Championship once with another early 1990s WCW figure, Stan Hansen.\n\nAs for the Masked Skyscraper (Mike Enos), he and his Destruction Crew teammate Wayne Bloom made their way to the WWF in 1991 as Beau (Bloom) and Blake (Enos) Beverly, the Beverly Brothers. Enos also later toured Japan, though with New Japan Pro Wrestling, where Vicious had once challenged for their title in the 1980s.\n"}
{"id": "1914943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914943", "title": "Room Service (Bryan Adams album)", "text": "Room Service (Bryan Adams album)\n\nRoom Service is the tenth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams. The album was released by Polydor Records on September 10, 2004. \"Room Service\" was the first release of new Adams material since the soundtrack album \"\" in 2002 and the first studio album in six years since \"On a Day Like Today\". Adams produced the album and co-wrote the songs with various co-writers, the themes of the songs being varied between street life, touring, truth, love and relationships.\n\n\"Room Service\" was a success entering the charts in more than 15 countries, peaking at number one in Germany and Switzerland and top ten in seven other territories. The album didn't fare as well in the United States, where it was released by Adams without a record company.\n\nFive songs were released from the album in various forms and at various times: \"Open Road\", \"Flying\", \"Room Service\", \"This Side of Paradise\" and \"Why Do You Have to Be So Hard to Love?\"; the first three were released as physical singles internationally and the last two as radio-airplay singles. The album's first single charted within the top twenty on the Canadian Singles Chart, the second within the top forties in Canada and the top hundred in Europe; \"Room Service\" was less commercially successful. The album was nominated for two Juno Awards, for \"CD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year\" and \"Artist of the Year\".\n\nAdams first started working on the album in 2001, but switched his focus on the soundtrack album, \"\" which was scheduled for release in 2002. Adams had started working on the album in The Warehouse Studio, Canada, but he ran out of time because he was about to headline a tour in Europe. He, together with his associates, created a system and decided to do small overdubs while on tour, to see how it worked out. The idea of recording while on tour was mainly due to boredom on Adams' part. With his earlier releases Adams used, in his own words, to \"go kind of nuts, a bit stir crazy\", so he began using his spare time on tour to write and record new songs. \"I tried to make use of the time which is generally spent doing nothing,\" Adams said. He was able to gather enough equipment into a couple of suitcases to create a small studio for himself. They'd normally order a couple of rooms, order room service, and then begin the recording season. Adams believed it to be a better working environment, even when he and the crew moved the gear many times during a season, and they would normally get help from the local staff.\n\nRegarding \"East Side Story\", the opening track, when asked why he picked New York for the song, Adams replied, \"Probably because there is so much street activity there, even though there is an east side to every city, the NY east side, or lower east side, is particularly full of character. It just seemed to paint the picture.\" The second track, \"This Side of Paradise\", is about finding the truth; there were many American radio stations that refused to play the song because of the line \"There ain't no Santa Claus\". The first single, \"Open Road\", was completed over two continents while Adams was touring. \"The basic track was recorded in Vancouver, at the Warehouse studio,\" Adams notes, but the vocals were done in Paris, France and guitarist Keith Scott started working on the song backstage in Lethbridge, Alberta. The music video for the song is not so much about traffic as it is about \"power, authority [...] and anti-establishment\" statements. The album's title track deals \"with the idea that touring can be very lonely\". When writing the song, Adams wanted to make the \"peephole in the hotel door\" so people could know what he was doing, while acknowledging that isn't always like that, \"but you do end up really missing the things you have at home\".\n\nReviews were generally lukewarm to poor. Elysa Gardner of \"USA Today\" gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of four, noted how many of the songs were similar to much of Adams previous work, calling the songs \"solid, digestible meat-and-potatoes rockers delivered in the '80s pop icon's immediately familiar rasp.\"\n\nBBC reviewer Michelle Adamson gave the album a mixed review, claimed the album had a reasonable beginning but quickly descended to its low point on track four, \"Flying\". However, she liked the nearly \"cliché-free lyrics\" of \"I Was Only Dreamin’\" which offered a little variety from the normal Adams treat. Adamson wrote in her conclusion that she felt there was too little to win over new fans, while acknowledging it would sink well in with old ones. David Wild of \"Rolling Stone\" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and noted, \"Adams' approach on \"Room Service\" sounds more hip in theory than in practice -- apparently he recorded the album in assorted hotel rooms and backstage areas while touring in Europe (where he remains in greater demand). The result: a disc that sounds less like Jackson Browne's \"Running on Empty\" (which was recorded in a similar fashion) than a very ordinary Bryan Adams album. [...] For the faithful, at least, \"Room Service\" still delivers.\"\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the record two out of five stars, saying the album \"evaporated\" after listening to it, as no songs were memorable, and because Adams was playing it \"safe\" with this record, no songs were bad nor good, just \"pleasant and professional\". He did, however, conclude that long-time Adams' fans would enjoy it but also ask the question; \"why he even bothers to record new albums if he doesn't have anything new to say?\" British music magazine \"Uncut\" gave it a rating of 2 out of 10—although while noting the album's \"inherently conservative nature\", ending the review with, \"\"Room Service\" is still a better record than you might imagine.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a C−, writing that Adams was still releasing material which \"cuts like a butter knife\", a reference to his earlier single, \"Cuts Like a Knife\" from 1983. Nancy Miller, the reviewer, considered \"Not Romeo, Not Juliet\" to be \"hokey\" and \"Nowhere Fast\" as a \"bland power ballad\".\n\n\"Room Service\" was Adams first studio album to be released in six years, since \"On a Day Like Today\" in 1998. In the US, it was released in the Spring of 2005 and achieved total sales of 44,000 units, the album debuted and peaked at number hundred-and-thirty-four on the \"Billboard\" 200 on the charts issue date of May 28, 2005. \"Room Service\" is Adams lowest charting album in the United States, and his second album to peak within the top two hundreds, the first being \"You Want It You Got It\" in 1982. The album would fall off the chart the following week. In his home country, Canada, the album peaked at number two on October 9, 2004, and remained on the country's chart for two weeks. Despite staying on the Canadian Albums Chart for a short while, it was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). \"Room Service\" also debuted at number one on the European Albums Chart. In the United Kingdom the album debuted at its peak position, number four, and fell off the charts six weeks later on November 6, 2004. The album was certified silver for sales of over 60,000 units on September 24 by the British Phonographic Industry, just four days after its release in the UK. At the 2005 Juno Awards, Adams was nominated for \"Artist of the Year\" and the album was nominated in the category \"CD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year\".\n\nInternationally, \"Room Service\" was a commercial success. The album peaked at number one in two countries: Germany and Switzerland. It also charted within the top ten in four countries: Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Portugal, also reaching the top twenty in Australia, Denmark, Spain and Sweden. France was the album's least successful charting territory, peaking within the top 200 at 200. The album was certified gold in Germany and Switzerland, thanks to sales of over 100,000 and 15,000 units respectively.\n\nThe resulting tour was a success, with almost every concert being sold out. The Room Service Tour continued from 2004 through 2006. Adams toured all round the world playing in countries like India, Pakistan, & Vietnam. In 2006, Adams became the first Western artist to perform in Pakistan, at Karachi.\n\n\n"}

It is told through the point of view of the oldest daughter, Ginny.\n\nLarry Cook is an aging farmer who decides to incorporate his farm, handing complete and joint ownership to his three daughters, Ginny, Rose, and Caroline. When the youngest daughter objects, she is removed from the agreement. This sets off a chain of events that brings dark truths to light and explodes long-suppressed emotions, as the story eventually reveals the long-term sexual abuse of the two eldest daughters that was committed by their father.\n\nThe plot also focuses on Ginny's troubled marriage, her difficulties in bearing a child and her relationship with her family.\n\nThere are many similarities between \"King Lear\" and \"A Thousand Acres\", including both plot details and character development. For example, some of the names of the main characters in the novel are reminiscent of their Shakespearean counterparts. Larry is Lear, Ginny is Goneril, Rose is Regan, and Caroline is Cordelia. The role of the Cooks' neighbors, Harold Clark and his sons Loren and Jess, also rework the importance of Gloucester, Edgar and Edmund in \"King Lear.\"\n\nThe novel maintains major themes present in \"Lear\", namely: gender roles, appearances vs. reality, generational conflict, hierarchical structures (the Great chain of being), madness, and the powerful force of nature.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1914951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914951", "title": "Azuchi Castle", "text": "Azuchi Castle\n\nNiwa Nagahide had responsibility for constructing the castle, which began in 1576 and completed in 1579.\n\nUnlike earlier castles and fortresses, Azuchi was not intended to be a military structure alone, cold, dark, and foreboding. Nobunaga intended it as a mansion which would impress and intimidate his rivals not only with its defenses, but also with its lavish apartments and decorations, flourishing town, and religious life. The keep, called \"tenshu\" (or \"tenshukaku\"), rather than being the center of the castle's defences, was a seven-story building containing audience halls, private chambers, offices, and a treasury, as though it were a royal palace. All seven stories were decorated by Kanō Eitoku. \n\nIn addition to being one of the first Japanese castles with a tower keep, Azuchi was unique in that its uppermost story was octagonal. In addition, the facade of Azuchi, unlike the solid white or black of other castles, was colorfully decorated with tigers and dragons.\n\nThere were five main militaristic features of Azuchi Castle that differentiated it from earlier castle designs. Firstly, it was a massive structure, with the walls of the castle ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 meters in thickness. The second feature of Azuchi Castle is the predominant use of stone. The walls were constructed from huge granite stones fitted carefully together without the use of mortar. A third innovation of the Azuchi Castle was the high central tower, or \"donjon\". The tower allowed for increased visibility for the use of guns against an opposing force. Builder’s plans for the castle show the donjon to be 40 meters, with seven levels. Fourthly, Azuchi Castle had irregularly formed inner citadels. These inner citadels gave defenders ample defensive positions against intruders. \n\nNobunaga chose Azuchi-yama for the location of Azuchi Castle, which rises 100 meters above Lake Biwa. The site was strategically placed at the intersection of three highways converging on Kyoto from the east.\n\nNobunaga desired a full castle town, and built well-defended homes for his generals, a Jōdo-shū Buddhist temple called Jōgon-in, and a number of homes for commoners a short distance away on the shore of the lake. He had trouble convincing people to move into these homes at first, however. In the summer of 1577, he issued a municipal charter, guaranteeing residents immunity from taxes, building or transport levies, and moratoria, and forced all travelers on the Nakasendō highway to stop in the town overnight for lodging, thus bringing business to his town's innkeepers. By 1582, the town's inhabitants numbered roughly 5,000.\n\nIn addition to welcoming many of Nobunaga's powerful political guests, such as Tokugawa Ieyasu and Niwa Nagahide, Azuchi castle also hosted an event in 1579 which has come to be known as the Azuchi religious debate (安土宗論, \"Azuchi shūron\"), taking place between leaders of the Nichiren and Jōdo-shū sects of Buddhism.\n\nIn the summer of 1582, just after Nobunaga's death at Honnō-ji, the castle was taken over by the forces of Akechi Mitsuhide, Nobunaga's betrayer. The castle was set aflame a week or so later, with some accounts claiming this might have been the work of looting townspeople, or of one of Nobunaga's sons.\n\nThe Azuchi-Momoyama Period of Japanese history takes its name, in part, from this castle.\n\nIn 1976, the Japanese architectural historian Akira Naitō published what he believed to be a conclusive summary of the features of Azuchi Castle. He concluded that the \"tenshu\" was 46 meters in height, with a gilded octagonal belvedere on top. An atrium rose from the basement level to the fourth floor ceiling, supposedly influenced by the Jesuits, but with a stupa at the atrium floor center. However, the external design of Azuchi Castle is still debated. Another Japanese Architectural Historian, Miyakami Shigetaka, has accused Naitō of failing to corroborate his theory with enough documentation.\n\nAll that remains of the castle today is the stone base. However, an approximate reproduction of Azuchi, based on illustrations and historical descriptions, stands in Ise Sengoku Village, a samurai theme park near Ise. In addition, a full-scale replica of the top floors of the donjon is on display at the Nobunaga no Yakata Museum near the original castle ruins.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1914965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914965", "title": "W. E. W. Petter", "text": "W. E. W. Petter\n\nWilliam Edward Willoughby \"Teddy\" Petter (8 August 1908, Highgate in Middlesex – 1 May 1968, Béruges) was a British aircraft designer. He is noted for Westland's wartime aeroplanes, the Canberra, the early design of the Lightning, and his last plane, the Folland Gnat.\n\nEdward 'Teddy' Petter was the eldest of the three sons and one daughter of Sir Ernest Petter (co-founder of Westland Aircraft Works) and his wife, Angela Emma. Because his father spent much time in London, Teddy's early childhood was spent mostly with his mother, from whom he inherited a strong religious conviction and firm ethical principles. He was educated at Marlborough College in Wiltshire then Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. During his first two years at Cambridge he focused his studies on subjects relevant to oil engines, the traditional product of Petters Limited, but in his third year he concentrated on aerodynamics and aircraft engineering. In 1929 he was awarded a first class in the mechanical sciences tripos and shared the John Bernard Seely prize in aeronautics.\n\nPetter joined Westland Aircraft Works as a graduate apprentice in 1929 and for the next 2 1/2 years he worked in every department, not seeking any favour despite being the chairman's son. In the drawing office it was noted that he was a very poor draftsman but had good ideas. Years later he said \"I looked on this as sheer drudgery at the time, but knew afterwards that without workshop knowledge I would never have become a designer\".\n\nIn May 1932 he was appointed personal assistant to the managing director, Robert Bruce, a position previously held by Petter's friend and colleague Harald Penrose. Bruce did not welcome the appointment and ignored him, leaving Petter spare time to modify and compete an Austin 7. Despite his interest in sports cars, Petter had no interest in learning to fly. Penrose gave him a flying lesson at this time, but later commented that Petter had a 'lack of the requisite sensitivity coupled with hopeless judgment of speed and distance'.\n\nHis father appointed Petter to the board in May 1934, making him technical director (at the age of 26) in preference over more experienced engineers such as Arthur Davenport and Geoffery Hill. This was not welcomed by the older members of the management, ultimately prompting Bruce and Hill to resign, and placing the older and more experienced Davenport in an intolerable position as his subordinate. One of his first actions as technical director was to terminate development of Hill's Pterodactyl, a pioneering tailless swept-wing aircraft.\n\nHowever, other business decisions by Ernest Petter infuriated Teddy. In July 1935 Ernest Petter convened a shareholders meeting to propose a merger with British Marine Aircraft for the purpose of expanding Westland's workshops. This proposal was thwarted by Teddy and Peter Acland who threatened to resign. But in July 1938 Ernest Petter sold the controlling shares in Westlands to John Brown Ltd, forming Westland Aircraft Limited as a separate company, with Eric Mensforth brought in to share the managing directorship with Peter Acland. Teddy saw the loss of family control of the company as the loss of his birthright, and this dispute would divide the Petter family for years, not being resolved until shortly before Ernest Petter's death in 1954.\n\nThe Air Ministry was initially reluctant to award Westland contracts due to Petter's inexperience, but his reputation as a successful designer was strengthened after it was demonstrated that the automatic slats on the PV 7 were both effective and reliable. As a result, and after internal discussion, the Air Ministry added Westland to the list of bidders for Specification A.39/34 (the replacement for the Hawker Hector army co-operation aircraft). Petter started the design by interviewing the Army Cooperation pilots and ground crew. Based on this information, he placed pilot visibility, the ability to take off and land in small spaces, and ease of ground maintenance as the prime requirements. The resulting design, the Westland P8 (later named the Lysander), was clearly an evolution of Westland's high-winged monoplane designs, but Petter incorporated a number of innovative features including extensive use of extruded sections throughout the airframe, something that would be a feature in his future designs. \n\nThe early flight testing revealed attitude control problems that the wind tunnel tests had not predicted. Petter instructed Penrose to conceal these problems from Ernest Petter. Later, when these problem had been addressed by a larger, variable-incidence tailplane, it was realised that if a landing was aborted and the throttles opened up fully, the Lysander could rear up and stall. While Penrose and RAF test pilots lobbied for modifications, Petter refused because redesign would affect production. Also, in his zeal to reduce weight, Petter had used glider fabric instead of specification Irish linen to cover the wings on the second prototype. This nearly caused a disaster when an RAF Pilot dived it to the limit, causing the fabric on the top surface to tear off.\n\nPetter's next fixed-wing aircraft design was a radical departure from the Westland's typical high-wing fabric-covered airframe. The Westland P9 was a low winged twin-engined aircraft employing the latest technology. It was designed to meet Air Ministry specification F.37/35, which called for a single-seat cannon-armed fighter, at least 40 mph faster than a contemporary bomber and not less than 330 mph at 15,000 ft. To obtain this performance Petter and Davenport chose to minimise drag; the two Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines were fitted in closely streamlined nacelles, and their radiators were fitted inside the wing inboard sections (something that would be later copied in the de Havilland Mosquito and the Hawker Tempest I). In the two prototypes the engine exhaust was routed through the fuel tanks in the wings to reduce parasitic drag. The Air Ministry thought that this was dangerous and insisted that conventional exhaust stacks be fitted.\n\nThe airframe was of thin-walled stressed skin construction, with the rear fuselage skinned in magnesium alloy. Like the Lysander, it made extensive use of extrusions in the airframe. To reduce the landing distance the wing incorporated automatic Handley Page slats coupled to the Fowler Flaps, with the radiator gills also coupled to the flap control, which was advanced at the time.\n\nThe prototype first flew in September 1938, and while it was one of the fastest and most heavily armed fighters of its era, faster than the Spitfire Mk 1, its development was problematic and protracted. The engines overheated, the hydraulic engine controls were imprecise, the slats slammed open, and production was slow. \n\nPetter was frustrated by its lack of operational status in the RAF. In November 1940, he wrote a memo to Sholto Douglas stating \"The Whirlwind is probably the most radically new aeroplane which has ever gone into service... New ideas I am afraid, even with the greatest care, always mean a certain amount of teething trouble... I really do not think these troubles have been any worse than they were on, say, the Spitfire... \" In reply Sholto Douglas wrote, \"... it seems to me that your firm is concentrating on producing large numbers of Lysanders, which no body wants... instead of concentrating on producing Whirlwinds which are wanted badly.\" Shortly after this exchange 263 squadron became operational, but Petter always regretted that the Whirlwind was not available for the Battle of Britain and blamed Eric Mensforth for the delay in production.\n\nBy 1942 Westland was building mostly Spitfires under contract. One of the problems with the early marks of Spitfire was variability of longitudinal stability, leading to aircraft getting dangerously out of control and contributing to the risk of structural failure . Petter made a significant contribution to improving the longitudinal stability of the Spitfire because he was the first to appreciate that aerodynamic modification to the elevator could provide additional stability. On his own initiative he had Penrose collect flight test stick force data and trim curves on a Spitfire at various centre of gravity loadings, then produced a prototype elevator with a bulged aerodynamic section, which produced a 'remarkable' improvement in stability, later being known as the 'Westland Elevator'.\n\nIn 1940, the Air Ministry was motivated by the threat of high altitude bombers such as the Ju86P, to issue a specification for a high altitude interceptor, F4/40, followed by a revision F7/41 in 1941. Petter submitted two designs. His first was an innovative low-drag aircraft (P13), which featured a pair of staggered Merlins in the fuselage, one behind and slightly above the other, driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers. His second submission was a conventional design (P14), describing it as 'a logical development of the successful Whirlwind...\". This was selected and became the Welkin.\n\nSpecification F7/41 required a minimum speed to 415mph at 33,000ft with a maximum ceiling of 42,000ft. The Air Ministry also wanted low altitude manoeuvrability and a +9G ultimate load factor. The speed was equivalent to a Mach number of 0.62 while the loading condition caused Petter to select a thick wing section which would later be demonstrated to have a critical Mach number of 0.6. The significance of the thick wing section may not have been understood by Petterbecause compressibility effects had only started to be encountered by aircraft designers. During test flying the effect of compressibility was experienced by Penrose who wrote, \"In speed runs at the ceiling the wings and fuselage sometimes shook as though the machine was bumping over cobblestones.\" Petter was reluctant to believe Penrose or accept that the wing would not be acceptable for high speed at altitude.\nWhile the cabin pressurisation was innovative and worked well, the heat from the compressor 'was like sitting in an oven'. Petter was unconcerned and reluctant to modify the system, Penrose thought that \"It was the machine's performance which interested him, not that of the pilot\". Petter devised a better method for cooling the cabin only after Penrose developed pneumonia attributed to this problem.\n\nPenrose said later that \"At this time Petter's intellect put him ahead of most contemporary designers as shown by his introduction of pressurization and extensive use of remote electrical controls which subsequently became standard practice. By the time of the Welkin he had learnt the lesson that it takes as long to develop an aeroplane as to design it... Petter was an outstanding organiser and could envisage construction time-scales with greater knowledge than Fearn and Wheeldon. ...it was his lack of understanding people and their motives that became his major failure.\"\n\nWestland's successful manufacture of Spitfires meant that Petter was well thought of by Sir Wilfrid Freeman, chief executive officer at the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) and by N. E. Rowe, its director of technical development. Discussions between all three led to Specification B1/44 for a jet-powered replacement for the Mosquito bomber. Petter developed his proposal for B1/44 as a private venture. This was a 56 ft span medium bomber powered by two Metrovick F.2/4 \"Beryl\" engines located within the fuselage and he persuaded the Westland board to put up capital to manufacture a mockup of the fuselage. This was his fifteenth wartime design study and his final design for Westland. \n\nThroughout his career when under stress, Petter would leave work without warning for periods of up to six weeks. In April 1944 he suddenly left work and it was rumoured that he had travelled to Switzerland, possibly to a monastery or a religious commune. In his absence Mensford switched the design effort from the B1/44 bomber to work on specification N11/44 for a Naval single-seat fighter that would eventually become the Wyvern.\n\nWhen Petter returned he was furious with Mensford. He knew Westland would not have the resources to develop and build both the fighter and the bomber. Also, to avoid the delays in production of the bomber he wanted Mensforth to give him full powers of a chief engineer responsible for every department concerned with its construction. He believed that in his absence the management had conspired to eliminate his project. As a result of this conflict he resigned in June, leaving the company in September 1944. He took with him the B1/44 design proposal and his large database of extrusions with their load capacities.\n\nBy 1944 English Electric was established as a leading manufacturer of modern aircraft, both in terms of quantity and quality. This success was certainly due in part to the drive of the Preston site general manager, Arthur Sheffield. However, the company did not have engineers capable of original aircraft design and to address this deficiency Sir George Nelson, English Electric's chairman, was introduced to Petter, (possibly by Sir Wilfred Freeman or Sir Ralph Sorley). With Petter on board, English Electric was put on the MAP short list to develop Britain's first jet bombers.\n\nPetter started work for English Electric in July 1944. As he was unencumbered by an existing design office, he had the opportunity to personally recruit a team of ambitious young engineers. His first recruit was Frederick Page, who was then a senior aerodynamicist at Hawkers. Petter first discussed the B1/44 proposal with Page in October 1944, and appointed him as his chief stress man the following April.\n\nIn 1945, Petter proposed a study contract to the MAP for a high-speed, high-altitude bomber to an updated specification (B3/45). This was granted in June allowing Petter and Page to establish the basic B3/45 configuration. While the original Westland B1/44 design had incorporated engines inside the fuselage, they realised this was incompatible with the internal fuel and bomb load. Instead they chose engines mounted in nacelles in the wings. Petter later explained that the technical solution was found to lie in the right choice of wing. Swept wings had been considered, but were was found to be unnecessary at the Mach numbers attainable when carrying a useful military load with the thrust available from two contemporary turbojets. The problems that the Welkin had encountered at altitude were avoided by choosing a wing with a low aspect-ratio allowing a modest thickness/chord ratio, together with a light wing-loading. The modest curvature of the wings meant that the intersection with the fuselage and nacelles required no fillets to smooth the flow. By late 1945 the design was sufficiently developed for a brochure to be submitted to the Ministry of Supply (MoS) who awarded a contract for four prototypes in January 1946.\n\nThe study contract in June 1945 enabled Petter to recruit and expand his team. He recruited Dai Ellis and Ray Creasey in 1946 as his aerodyamicists. He recruited Roland Beamont in May 1947 as his chief experimental test pilot; doing this as a means of bypassing Arthur Sheffield's control of the production test pilots and also because both he and Page wanted close integration of the test pilot within the design team. Members of the team Petter put together to develop the Canberra would go on to lead military aircraft development in the U.K for the next four decades, playing significant roles in the development of the Lightning, TSR-2, Jaguar, and the Tornado, some becoming members of the divisional board of directors.\n\nOf this time at Warton, Beamont said \"although Petter was generally thought to be difficult I found him logical and 'ahead of the game' and totally oriented on making an enormous success of the Canberra. That it achieved this was due to his personal ability to recognise the technical argument and act on it correctly.\"\n\nThe aircraft would stay in operation in the RAF for 57 years until June 2006. In the United States, the Martin Company built the design under licence from 1953, as the Martin B-57, which was operated by the United States Air Force (USAF), NASA, the Pakistan Air Force and Taiwan Air Force. While the type was retired by the USAF in 1983, NASA still operates three.\n\nDespite the lack of enthusiasm for manned supersonic flight in postwar Britain (The Miles M.52 was cancelled in February 1946), Petter made provisional sketches for a supersonic fighter in 1946. To achieve a small frontal area and reduce wave drag it had two Rolls-Royce Derwent engines mounted one above the other in the fuselage, echoing his earlier Westland P13 proposal. He lobbied Whitehall on the matter of supersonic flight and in 1948 Handel Davis and a party from the MoS visited Petter in Warton to discuss experimental supersonic development work under specification E.R. 103. This meeting resulted in Petter initiating a design proposal with Page leading the design and Ray Creasey responsible for the aerodynamics. By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40° degree swept wing This proposal was submitted in the November and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric. On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949. To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60° with the ailerons moved to the wingtips. In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing. Hence, by late 1949 the basic configuration of the P.1A Lightning was fixed.\n\nBy late 1949 the relationship between Sheffield's Preston Strand Road engineering works and Petter's design team at Warton had deteriorated. Modifications to the Canberra to incorporate a bomb aimer, camera bays and dual seat for the navigation trainer required a redesign of the front fuselage, which caused disruption in the design office and the workshops. In addition, with the P.1A Lightning design programme ramping up, Petter demanded a separate administration for Warton and an experimental workshop under his control as a condition of his continued service with English Electric. Sir George Nelson was unable to reach a compromise acceptable to both Petter and Sheffield. Page tried to persuade Petter to stay by promising to help in dealing with Sheffield. From December 1949 Petter ceased to take an active part in running Warton, he visited Warton once again to speak to a few people and clear his office. Page took over the day-to-day management until in February 1950, Petter resigned and Page was formally appointed his successor.\n\nThe Lightning remains the only all-British Mach 2 aircraft.\n\nIn the late 1940s Folland Aircraft Limited in Hamble, Hampshire was manufacturing sub-assemblies for other aircraft manufacturers. Henry Folland planned to retire and recruited Petter as chief engineer and deputy managing director. Petter joined Folland in September 1950, succeeding Henry Folland as managing director in July 1951. Although Petter had entered into an anti-poaching agreement with English Electric, a number of his ex-colleagues joined Folland when positions were openly advertised. With a strong team, led by a designer of Petter's pedigree, Folland was now able to win MoS design contracts, such as that for the development of the Red Dean air-to-air missile in mid-1951.\n\nOn 11 July 1951 a delegation from the RAF visited Petter to discuss the requirements for a lightweight interceptor to counter the threat of escorted Russian Tu-4 bombers (AST OR/303). To address this, Petter developed a number of concepts. His early designs used jettisonable engines but by late 1951 he had focussed on more conventional designs; the Fo 139 and Fo 140 (which would eventually be developed into the Midge and Gnat respectively). With concept design work on the light fighter ramping up, Petter decided not to proceed with the Red Dean and the MoS cancelled the contract in November 1951.\n\nPetter sent a brochure describing the Fo.140 to the Air Staff in January 1952, but beyond this, further development of the light fighters was hindered by the lack of engines with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. The Bristol Saturn was cancelled, the AS Viper had insufficient thrust, Rolls Royce did not have a suitable engine and was not willing to develop one. To address this problem Petter approached Stanley Hooker at Bristol in late 1952 to discuss the design of a suitable engine. This meeting would lead to the development of the Orpheus.\n\nBy 1952 Government interest in a light fighter had waned. Despite this Petter began the design and construction of the prototype as a private venture. The Fo 139 design was revised, adopting a shoulder-mounted wing and a low-set tailplane. In common with his previous designs, Petter made use of magnesium alloys in the structure, using material surplus from the RTV2 Missile programme in the construction of the Midge prototype.\n\nIn June 1953 Petter presented his manifesto on light fighter design at the AFITA congress at the Paris Air show. In this paper, titled \"Design for Production\", Petter compared a 2500 kg light fighter with a 7500 kg standard fighter and concluded that although the weight ratio was 3:1, four times as many light fighters could be manufactured for the same cost. To achieve this he explained how the fuselage, wing structure, engine and services could all be simplified.\n\nColonel Johnnie Driscoll, head of the NATO Mutual Weapons Development Program noted Petter's light fighter concept. NATO was interested in ground-attack aircraft that could be operated from improvised airfields and could be manufactured by postwar European industry. Driscoll formalised a NATO requirement in August 1954 that would become the NATO light fighter competition. It was based on Petter's concept but included the requirement to use low-pressure tyres. However, the Gnat was designed to operate from concrete runways and used high-pressure tyres. Petter refused to modify the undercarriage because this would mean bulging the undercarriage doors and spoiling the Gnat's clean aerodynamic lines. Stanley Hooker urged him to 'Just say that you will try to do it', but Petter's moral code would not let him make false claims. As a result, the Gnat was eliminated from the competition in June 1955. Ironically, the Gnat trainer design would show that the wider tyres could be used without increasing drag.\n\nProduction of the Midge progressed to schedule and it was rolled out of the workshop on 31 July 1954, making its maiden flight on 11 August 1954. The Gnat first flew on 18 July 1955 and while it was demonstrated to be a capable aircraft, there was little interest in it in Europe. In November 1955 the Indian government showed an interest in both purchasing and in licensed manufacture. Petter made several visits to India and he and his design team were highly regarded by HAL. An approach was made to him to set up a design team in India.However, his relationship with Indian government officials was antagonistic due to arguments over variations in contract costs.\n\nIn the late 1950s Petter rationalised his senior staff, dismissing those he thought had failed to meet his standards. However at the same time the Macmillan government was rationalising the aircraft industry and made the order for Gnat Trainers conditional on Folland merging with the Hawker Siddely group. Such a merger would effectively make Petter subordinate to Sir Sidney Camm, with whom Petter had a good relationship (Camm had provided Petter with the Hunter wind tunnel data during the development of the Gnat) but the working relationship would be intolerable. At the same period his wife Claude was showing the early signs of Parkinson's disease. These two factors prompted Petter to announce his resignation to the Hawker Siddely board on 11 November 1959, leaving Folland in the December.\n\nThroughout his education at Marborough and Cambridge Petter seems to have led a reclusive life. At Cambridge he had one close friend, John McCowan, with whom he shared an interest in motor cars. It was during a stay at the McCowan family farm that Petter met his future wife Claude, the daughter of Louis Munier a Swiss official at the League of Nations in Geneva. Teddy and Claude were married in August 1933, in her home town near Geneva, with McCowan as their best man. The Petters had three daughters, Camile in 1936, Francoise in 1938 and Jenni in 1945. While living in Dorset in the 1930s he designed his own house, a modern wooden chalet, with oil heating, double glazing and an automatic garage door.\n\nWhen he left Folland he had intended to continue as a consultant engineer, with a limited interest in the Gnat. However, in January 1960 Petter left the aircraft industry completely, stating \"I have finished with aviation completely. I have strong religious interests to which I am now going to give a lot of my time.\"\n\n‌Five years earlier, Claude had been introduced to a 'Father Forget', a former minister of the Reformed Church of France who claimed to be able to cure her Parkinson's disease through communal prayer. With Claude and daughter Jenni, Teddy Petter joined Father Forget's commune in 1960 and moved to Switzerland. There he lived the simple life of a holy man until in May 1968 he died, aged 59, of bleeding from a chronic stomach ulcer. He was buried in Beruges, Poitou-Charentes, in France. Claude died in 1975.\n\n\n\n"}

Montgomery is also one of the few elite closers in baseball history to have four types of baseball pitches. Most top relievers concentrate on two pitches.\n\nMontgomery played collegiate baseball at Marshall University and was later drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft. He made his debut with the Reds on August 1, 1987 at age 25. He pitched a total of 14 games, including one start. He was considered a marginal prospect, and the Reds traded Montgomery to the Royals on February 15, 1988 for Van Snider, an outfielder who would go on to only play 19 games in the majors.\n\nOn April 29, 1990, Montgomery struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 5-2 win over the Texas Rangers. Montgomery became the ninth American League pitcher and the 23rd pitcher in major league history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning.\n\nKansas City installed Montgomery in the bullpen, and he appeared in 45 games, posting a record of 7-2 with a 3.45 earned run average. In 1989 he had a breakout season, winning 7 games and losing 3, saving 18, and posting a 1.37 ERA while acting primarily as a set-up man for Steve Farr. The following season, he became the Royals' closer, a role he held for most of his career.\n\nIn 1993, Montgomery saved 45 games, tying Dan Quisenberry for the Royals' team record and tying him for the league lead with Duane Ward of the Toronto Blue Jays. That year he won the American League Rolaids Relief Man Award. Montgomery was also an All-Star in 1992, 1993, and 1996.\n\nIn 1998, Montgomery collected 36 saves and was named Kansas City Royals Pitcher of the Year following the season. Montgomery lost effectiveness during the season, which he finished with 12 saves and a 6.84 ERA. He retired following the season, and was inducted into the Royals' Hall of Fame in , his first year of eligibility.\n\nFollowing his career, Montgomery appeared in an instructional video titled \"The Fundamentals of Pitching with Jeff Montgomery.\"\n\nMontgomery is involved in many business interests, among them serving as a Vice-President of Union Broadcasting in Kansas City, Missouri.

He is known best for his epigrams. \n\nWilliam Soutar was born on 28 April 1898 in Perth, Scotland, the only child of John Soutar (1871–1958), master joiner, and his wife, Margaret Smith (1870–1954), who wrote poetry. His parents belonged to the United Free Church of Scotland. He was educated at Southern District School, Perth, and at Perth Academy, before joining the wartime Royal Navy in 1916. By the time he was demobilized in November 1918, he was already suffering from what was to be diagnosed in 1924 as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of chronic inflammatory arthritis.\n\nSoutar began to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1919, but switched to English. He did not excel academically, but he began to contribute to the student magazine. His first volume, \"Gleanings by an Undergraduate\" (1923), was published at his father's expense, as were several others. He began to keep a diary on 18 April 1919. During that period he made contact with Hugh MacDiarmid, then in Montrose, and with Ezra Pound. MacDiarmid at this time was abandoning poetry in English in favour of a \"synthetic Scots\", a literary language compiled from dialects and from earlier writers such as Robert Henryson and William Dunbar.\n\nSoutar's work correspondingly altered radically, and he became a leading figure of the Scottish Literary Renaissance, whom posthumous editors would dub \"one of the greatest poets Scotland has produced.\" His family adopted an orphaned cousin of his, seven-year-old Evelyn, in 1927, and this became a spur for him to write also for children. \"Seeds in the Wind\" (1933) was a volume of \"bairn-rhymes\" in Scots.\n\nBy 1930 Soutar was bedridden with his disease. He died in 1943 of tuberculosis, which he had contracted in 1929. He is buried in Perth's Jeanfield and Wellshill Cemetery. His collected poems, edited by MacDiarmid, were published in 1948. His journal, \"The Diary of a Dying Man\", was published posthumously. One form of verse which he used were cinquains (now known as American cinquains), which he preferred to call \"epigrams\". Interest in Soutar's work in Scots and English, and for adults and children, has revived considerably since the 1980s, although none of his verse was in print for his centenary in 1998. In 2014 he was the subject of a BBC radio programme: \"The Still Life Poet\" by Liz Lochhead.\n\nBenjamin Britten set twelve of Soutar's poems for tenor voice and piano in the 1969 song cycle \"Who Are These Children?\" (op. 84).\n\n\n"}

A number of her regular crew were unable to make the trip due to illness as the 1918 flu pandemic had reached her base at Esquimalt. She set out towards the Queen Charlotte Islands from Triangle Island at 5 pm on 29 October 1918. When she made her only distress call at 3 am the next morning, she was estimated to be within visual range of the light at Cape St. James from Triangle Island.

Shells of living specimens found today in the waters around Japan are almost identical to ancient Cambrian fossils.\n\nThe Lingulata have tongue-shaped shells (hence the name Lingulata, from the Latin word for \"tongue\") with a long fleshy stalk, or pedicle, with which the animal burrows into sandy or muddy sediments. They inhabit vertical burrows in these soft sediments with the anterior end facing up and slightly exposed at the sediment surface. The cilia of the lophophore generate a feeding and respiratory current through the lophophore and mantle cavity. The gut is complete and J-shaped.\n\nLingulata shells are composed of a combination of calcium phosphate, protein and chitin. This is unlike most other shelled marine animals, whose shells are made of calcium carbonate. The Lingulata are inarticulate brachiopods, so named for the simplicity of their hinge mechanism. This mechanism lacks teeth and is held together only by a complex musculature.

{"id": "1915005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915005", "title": "Mega Man V (Game Boy)", "text": "Mega Man V (Game Boy)\n\nMega Man V is a video game published by Capcom for the Game Boy handheld game console. It is the fifth game in the Game Boy version of the original \"Mega Man\" series. The game follows the adventures of the protagonist Mega Man as he must defend the Earth from a group of powerful robots from outer space called the Stardroids. \"Mega Man V\" is unique among the Game Boy Mega Man games as it features original bosses rather than recycling those from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) \"Mega Man\" games.\n\n\"Mega Man V\" is an action platformer in which the player selects stages in a non-linear fashion and acquires the weapon of each boss defeated to use as their own. Although it plays nearly identical to other games in the series, \"Mega Man V\" features a new default weapon (the powerful \"Mega Arm\") and introduces Tango, a new assistant character. \"Mega Man V\" received an average to positive critical reception. In 2013, \"Mega Man V\" was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.\n\nThe game opens in an unspecified year in the 21st century (\"20XX AD\"), several months after the events of \"Mega Man IV\" and another failure by the infamous Dr. Wily to conquer the world. Mega Man and his sister Roll are strolling through a grassy field, when they are confronted by a mysterious robot who calls himself Terra. Mega Man attempts to fight Terra, only to find that his \"Mega Buster\" arm cannon has no effect on him. Mega Man is knocked unconscious, and powerful robots calling themselves the \"Stardroids\" attack Earth, defeating numerous robots, including Robot Masters from previous \"Mega Man\" games. Waking up in Dr. Light's laboratory, Mega Man is presented with the new and powerful \"Mega Arm\" to help him fight the Stardroids in his newest mission to save the planet.\n\nAfter defeating all the Stardroids, including Terra, Mega Man finds out that his archenemy Dr. Wily was ordering them to dominate Earth. Mega Man sets off to the mad scientist's new base, the Wily Star (a reference to the Death Star) to stop him. In the base, Mega Man has rematches with four foes from his previous adventures (Enker, Quint, Punk, and Ballade). Wily releases an ancient robot called Sunstar to destroy Mega Man. However, Sunstar attacks Wily instead, and then turns his attention to Mega Man. Mega Man wins the battle and tries to convince Sunstar to be repaired by Dr. Light. However, Sunstar is already too badly damaged, and minutes later he explodes, taking the Wily Star with him. Mega Man escapes using Rush. He walks through a field, pondering the recent events, when Wily makes one last, unsuccessful attack. The game ends with Mega Man chasing Wily off the screen.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Mega Man V\" is largely similar to other games in the \"Mega Man\" series. As the protagonist Mega Man, the player is presented with a set of action and platform-style levels to complete. Mega Man's primary weapon is his staple arm cannon. However, rather than being able to charge and fire a more powerful blast with the trademark Mega Buster, the Mega Arm is used in essentially the same manner. Charging up and releasing the firing button causes Mega Man's arm to detach, strike an enemy, and then reattach. Destroying the boss at the end of each stage adds its special weapon to Mega Man's arsenal for the rest of the game. As each boss is weak to specific weapon, the player is encouraged to complete some stages before others. These bosses are known in game as \"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\", and \"Pluto\", named after the first, second, fourth, and fifth through eighth planets in our Solar System. Pluto was, at the time the game was made, considered a planet, unlike from 2006 and onwards. Terra is named for the Latin word for Earth. Defeating some bosses will allow the player to access Mega Man's robot dog Rush, who can transform into useful \"Coil\" and \"Jet\" modes for easier stage navigation. \"Mega Man V\" also introduces Tango the cat, another robotic pet to help Mega Man. Like the bird Beat from previous installments in the series, Tango will appear on the screen when summoned to attack enemies, transforming into a buzzsaw and ricocheting around the room. As in \"Mega Man IV\", the player can return to Dr. Light between stages to purchase items using \"Power Chips (P-Chips)\" scattered throughout the game.\n\n\"Mega Man V\" breaks an established trend in the \"Mega Man\" games released on the Game Boy handheld. Prior to its release, games in the series on the system featured a set of four \"Robot Masters\" boss characters from their titular NES counterpart and a second set of four from the succeeding NES game in the series. \"Mega Man V\" instead features entirely original enemy characters with the Stardroids, who are all named after the planets in the Solar System: Neptune, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Pluto, Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn and Terra (Earth).\n\"Mega Man V\" was developed by the same third-party company that worked on three of the four previous Game Boy \"Mega Man\" games. According to \"Mega Man\" series artist Keiji Inafune, the fifth installment took the longest time to develop of all five of these titles. Inafune was responsible for the game's character designs after their initial concepts were devised. \"When you have a theme to follow, it can make things easier and harder at the same time,\" Inafune recounted. \"Especially with a theme as vague as space.\" He additionally recalled having \"a lot of reservations\" when designing the Stardroids. Tango was included as a support character not featured in the home console games; his name, like other characters in the series, is part of musical motif. Inafune, who always enjoyed working on animal support characters, was especially pleased to design Tango due to the artist's personal fondness for cats. \"Mega Man V\" is the final installment in the Game Boy line of games based on the original \"Mega Man\" series. Inafune stated, \"In the end, I think we had a lot of fun working on this series\". \"Mega Man V\" was developed with Super Game Boy support, which allows the game to be played with a custom color scheme and border on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was one of the first games available with added support from the peripheral. It was also the last time the classic 8-bit Mega Man sprite was used for a game released on an 8-bit console, and last until \"Mega Man 9\" in 2008.\n\nOverall critical reception for \"Mega Man V\" has been average to positive. While many aspects of the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. \"VideoGames\" summarized, \"If you don't have a \"Mega Man\" game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's \"Mega Man\". If you're thinking 'rehash', you might be right and it's still a pretty fun game, though.\" \"Nintendo Power\" was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, \"especially when you sit down with the Super Game Boy and cruise\". \"GamePro\" was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler.\n\nIn 2008, \"Nintendo Power\" listed \"Mega Man V\" as the 14th best Game Boy or Game Boy Color video game, praising it as the best of a quality series of portable \"Mega Man\" games. \"Game Informer\"s Ben Reeves called it the 11th best Game Boy game due to its relative ambition compared to its Game Boy predecessors. \"Mega Man V\" was available for the similarly named Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan on April 13, 2001 alongside its four Game Boy \"Mega Man\" predecessors. Outside Japan, the game is considered to be quite rare. All five games on the Game Boy were to be released as part of a Game Boy Advance compilation in 2004 titled \"Mega Man Anniversary Collection\", but it was delayed indefinitely, renamed Mega Mania, and eventually cancelled. In 2011, IGN listed the game among titles they wished to see downloadable from the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man V is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console; it came out November 6, 2013 in Japan, on May 22, 2014 in North America. and August 28, 2014 in the PAL Region.\n\nThe characters and plotline for \"Mega Man V\" were incorporated into the \"Mega Man Gigamix\" comic books by Hitoshi Ariga, with the battle against the Stardroids acting as a finale.\n\nThey were also present in the \"Mega Man\" series from Archie Comics, with a full adaptation of \"Mega Man V\" being foreshadowed in various stories but not coming to pass before the series went on indefinite hiatus. The comic storyline takes unique action of linking the Stardroids with \"Mega Man 3\"s Shadow Man and Ra Moon, the primary antagonist of \"Super Adventure Rockman\", as well as giving them a history with the alien robot Duo and Trio, his unnamed antagonist from \"Mega Man 8\". Ra Moon's intent during \"Super Adventure Rockman\" to prepare the Earth for the arrival of its Stardroid creations; when its defeat at Mega Man's hands made this impossible, it sent a signal to the Stardroids aboard their craft, the future Wily Star. Terra appeared briefly in issue 20 of the series while Mega Man was caught up in a time travel adventure, and later during a flashback in which he sent Ra Moon to Earth under the protection of the Kuiper Droids, a group of bodyguard robots of whom Shadow Man is the last surviving member. Dr. Light later witnessed the Stardroids' future invasion in a vision experienced during issue 55, the last issue before the series went on hiatus.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling from 1997 to 2001.\n\nDoring was trained by Taz, Bubba Ray Dudley and Perry Saturn at the ECW House of Hardcore in 1996. Once his training was complete, he joined the ECW roster, facing Taz in his debut match in May 1997. Doring's original gimmick was that of a wrestler who used many unexciting holds and had vertigo, so would not use high-flying moves. When the audience chanted \"boring\", Doring would pretend that they were chanting for him.\n\nIn December 1997, Doring changed his gimmick to that of a womanizer, and formed an unlikely tag team with his fellow House of Hardcore graduate, Roadkill. They were managed by Angelica, his on-screen girlfriend, for six months, until she left ECW in November 1999 to join the World Wrestling Federation as Lita, and then by Elektra until she turned on them in 2000.\n\nDoring and Roadkill quickly embarked on a two-year-long feud with Nova and Chris Chetti. This was followed by a series of matches with Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger and Joey Matthews and Christian York. The team won the ECW World Tag Team Championship on December 3, 2000, at the Massacre on 34 Street pay-per-view, defeating Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido. They held the title until ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001.\n\nAfter this, Doring went to XPW (Xtreme Pro Wrestling) which had the hardcore style that ECW did. He won the XPW television championship.\n\nDoring appeared at the WWE promoted ECW reunion show, ECW One Night Stand 2005 on June 12, 2005. Since then he has competed in try-out matches for the WWE SmackDown brand alongside Roadkill.\n\nOn May 5, 2006, WWE announced through their mobile news service that Doring had signed a contract with them to appear on the upcoming ECW brand. On the premiere June 13 edition of \"ECW\", Doring took part in a battle royal (with the winner facing John Cena at Vengeance). Doring appeared on an episode of \"ECW\" against Mike Knox and lost to him. After losing a match to Rob Van Dam on the August 22 episode of \"ECW\", he and Van Dam were both attacked by the returning Hardcore Holly. Doring wrestled a match of an ECW show in 2006. This was against CM Punk, which Danny would lose. He competed in live events with the likes of Nunzio and one time Kurt Angle, mostly in losing efforts.\n\nHe was released from WWE in December 2006.\n\nDoring appeared at Maryland Championship Wrestling's \"Holiday Homecoming\" event in Glen Burnie, Maryland on December 28, 2006, wrestling as The Sugarmask (as the name suggests, under a mask) in the opening match against D.J. Hyde. After defeating Hyde, he unmasked to reveal himself to the fans. Doring debuted at the January 5, 2008 show of Force One Pro Wrestling, titled \"Badge of Honor\". He won a four-way elimination match, featuring Mike Reed, Nicky Benz, and Rockin' Rebel. At the March 16, 2008 Force One show titled \"Never Surrender\" Doring defeated Breaker Morant to win the Force One Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. He defeated Breaker Morant again at the May 3, 2008 show titled \"Pledge of Allegiance 2: These Colors Don't Run\". On the June 21, 2008, show titled \"Justice For All\" Doring lost the belt, now known as the NWA Force One Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship to Stevie Richards. He was unsuccessful in a rematch, and is yet to return to the promotion since. Also, he wrestled against F.B.I. with Roadkill, defeating F.B.I. on October 6, 2012, in the first House of Hardcore show.\n\nIn June 2015, as Danny Morrison, he served as commentator of House of Hardcore TV.\n\nDoring was frequently known by the nicknames \"Dastardly\" and \"The Danaconda\" during his ECW career and used Soul Coughing's song \"Super Bon Bon\" as his entrance theme song in ECW. He used \"Wham, Bam, Thank You Ma'am\" as his finishing move. He had a variety of signature moves which included a back elbow, the \"Bareback\",\n\nDoring has a wife, and three children; a son, and twin girls.\n\nAs a child and teenager, he dreamed of becoming a professional wrestler, his hero being Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage.\n\nHe is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys and watches them play in free time.\n\nOn December 10, 2016, he represented the Dallas Cowboys Nation in the Metlife stadium.\n\n\n\n"}

Funded by Giovanni Volpi, Serenissima used Ferraris to much success until the founder financed the exiled Ferrari company, ATS. Thereafter, Enzo Ferrari would no longer sell his cars to Serenissima, so the company turned to De Tomaso, ATS, and Maserati. Volpi, and thus Serenissima, halted automobile operations in 1970.\n\nIn 1961, Scuderia Serenissima entered the Formula One World Championship. They first entered a Cooper T51 for Maurice Trintignant at the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, where he finished seventh. In Belgium, Trintignant retired on lap 23 with a broken gearbox after having qualified his car in 19th place. At the 1961 French Grand Prix, Scuderia Serenissima entered two cars. Again the Cooper for Trintignant and a De Tomaso for Giorgio Scarlatti. Trintignant finished in 13th place while Scarlatti retired on lap 15 when his engine broke down. At the German Grand Prix Trintignant retired on lap 12 when his engine broke down. In the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, Scuderia Serenissima again entered two cars, the Cooper for Trintignant and a De Tomaso for Nino Vaccarella. Trintignant finished the race in ninth place and Vaccarella retired on lap 13 when his engine broke down. In 1962, now called Scuderia SSS Republica di Venezia, they entered cars for Nino Vaccarella. In Monaco, Vaccarella failed to qualify for the race. Three races later in Germany, Vaccarella finished in 15th place. At the last race for the Scuderia in Italy Vaccarella finished in 9th place. In 1966 Serenissima supplied engines to McLaren. And at the 1966 British Grand Prix Bruce McLaren finished in sixth place, scoring one World Championship point.\n\nIn 1963, Volpi began developing his own prototype GT car, the Jungla GT. It used a new V8 engine, designed by Alberto Massimino, with closed bodywork by Francesco Salomone (built by Gran Sport). A later open version was built by Fantuzzi.\n\n"}
{"id": "1915045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915045", "title": "Warner Wolf", "text": "Warner Wolf\n\nWarner William Wolf (born November 11, 1937) is an American television and radio sports broadcaster, perhaps best known as a local news sports anchor in Washington, D.C. and New York City, and for his catchphrase \"Let's go to the videotape!\" He was also known for referring to the “foul pole” as the ”fair pole.”\n\nWolf was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Rosemary and Jack Wolf. His father, an actor and comedian who briefly worked as a member of Ted Healy's \"stooge\" act, was born Jewish and his mother converted to Judaism. His earliest experience in broadcasting was on the intercom system of Calvin Coolidge High School in Washington, D.C. in the 1950s. His upbeat, entertaining patter that was to become his trademark made his sports report a welcome treat for the kids. During this period he worked part-time at Baker's Shoe Store downtown, as a salesman. Many customers must have been puzzled at the ball park hawker's refrain of, \"Get your hot dogs, get your hot doggies here\" coming from the back store room. He was simply entertaining the staff and the customers, something he was to continue throughout his long career.\n\nWolf began as a radio broadcaster on April 1, 1961, doing news, weather, and sports for WLSI-AM in Pikeville, Kentucky under the name Ken Wolf. He then moved on to radio jobs in Martinsburg, West Virginia at WEPM, and Washington, D.C. at WTOP-AM before landing a sports television role in 1965 at WTOP-TV (now WUSA) in Washington. There he became very well known and popular as the news sports anchor; he also did play-by-play announcing of local college and professional sports. He retained his job as sports director at WTOP-AM throughout the 1960s, even announcing occasionally on radio broadcasts of Washington Senators games.\n\nIn 1976, Wolf gained an ABC Sports network role, working on \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts and as a host for coverage of football and the Olympics. Wolf's reception in those jobs was mixed, and he decided that he was best at the local news sports anchor role.\n\nStill under contract with ABC, Wolf returned to local sportscasting with a job at WABC-TV in New York in 1976, and then in 1980 moved to rival station WCBS-TV. His move to WCBS-TV resulted in a lawsuit, \"American Broadcasting Co. v. Wolf\", in which ABC alleged that Wolf failed to negotiate in good faith and sought specific performance of their contract which would have kept Wolf off the air for two years. The New York Court of Appeals rejected ABC's argument, although they permitted ABC to seek relief in the form of monetary damages. He also broadcast live sports reports for Israeli television during the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nWolf returned to Washington as the sports anchor at WUSA, the former WTOP-TV, in June 1992. Wolf succeeded Glenn Brenner, who died earlier that year and had replaced Wolf back in 1977 when he joined ABC Sports. He was dismissed in August 1995. Between November 1995 and December 1996, Wolf was the guest host of \"The Tony Kornheiser Show\" on Thursdays on WTEM and sometimes he also flew to New York as a substitute sports anchor on \"Imus in the Morning\" when the regular sports anchor, Mike Breen, was away. Because of his work on \"Imus in the Morning\" and Don Imus' recommendation on the air continuously, Wolf went back to WCBS-TV as the sports anchor on February 3, 1997 (the most recent of his replacements at WCBS, Bernie Smilovitz, had returned to WDIV in Detroit after having been caught in WCBS' infamous 1996 mass firings). During his tenure at WCBS he began uttering his famous phrase \"Let's go to the videotape!\" on a regular basis to switch to a video of the game he was reporting on. \n\nDuring this time he also continued to do some work in radio, giving sports reports on the nationally syndicated \"Imus in the Morning\" program. Wolf broke the news of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the \"Imus\" show, when he saw the World Trade Center on fire from his Lower Manhattan apartment. Wolf also covered the story for WCBS-TV (where he was working at the time).\n\nHe stayed there until May 2004, returning to WABC (AM) in 2006 as the sports reporter for Curtis and Kuby, and continuing, with a two-week hiatus, on the \"Imus in the Morning\" program following Don Imus's arrival at WABC (AM). He served as Imus's sports contributor until November 3, 2016, when Imus decided to replace Wolf with Sid Rosenberg. Wolf sued Imus alleging age discrimination.\n\nOn May 27, 2004 Wolf was fired by WCBS-TV general manager Lew Leone three months before his contract expired, and replaced by a much younger anchor, Chris Wragge. The day after his firing, his picture covered half the front page of the \"New York Daily News\" with the other half being covered by the headline \"WOLF FANS RAISE A HOWL\".\n\nA few months after his firing, which generated much public outcry, Wolf was hired by radio station WABC and he appeared weekday mornings with Curtis Sliwa & Ron Kuby as well as Mark Simone's Saturday morning radio program. When \"Imus in the Morning\" returned to WABC in December 2007, Wolf was not the sports anchor: Tony Powell took that position. But after several weeks Wolf returned to his old position and continued as the morning sports anchor for the \"Imus in the Morning\" show. Wolf also hosted a Saturday sports talk show on 1050 ESPN Radio. Wolf modified his trademark \"Let's go to the videotape!\" to \"Let's go to the audiotape!\"\n\nWolf's final day with the Imus show was November 4, 2016. He stayed at WABC until December 3, when his current contract expired.7.\n\nOn February 7, 2019, Wolf turned himself in and was arrested after he broke letters off a sign at the entrance of Classics Plantation Estates in East Naples, Florida, according to deputies at the Collier County Sheriff's Office. Wolf, a resident of the community, expressed his opinion at homeowners association meetings that the word \"plantation\" was racist. Surveillance video on November 30, 2018 shows a man matching Wolf's description removing the word \"plantation\" from the sign with a tool. Wolf faces a felony charge of criminal mischief, according to the arrest report.\n\nWolf played himself in the film \"Rocky IV\" and has made several other cameo appearances. He is the author of the books \"Let's Go to the Videotape\" and \"Give Me a Break\". Wolf is currently heard Mondays at 7:30 AM on \"Len Berman and Michael Riedel in the Morning\" on WOR AM-710 in New York.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1915047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915047", "title": "Willie Wilson (baseball)", "text": "Willie Wilson (baseball)\n\nWillie James Wilson (born July 9, 1955) is a former professional baseball player. He played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Kansas City Royals, Oakland Athletics, and Chicago Cubs. He was an outfielder known for his speed and ability as an effective leadoff hitter. Wilson's career total of 668 stolen bases currently ranks him in 12th place all-time among major leaguers.\n\nWilson was born in Montgomery, Alabama but moved to Summit, New Jersey at seven years old. He was a highly regarded high school baseball, football, and basketball player at Summit High School. In his senior year, he hit .436 and stole 28 bases in 28 attempts.\n\nWilson was drafted out of high school after signing a letter of intent to play college football at Maryland. The Kansas City Royals picked him in the first round of the 1974 draft. He started his professional career with the Gulf Coast Royals. He moved up to class-A in 1975 for the Waterloo Royals, leading the 1975 Midwest League champions in both RBIs and stolen bases, and in 1976 played for the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. He earned a September call-up in 1976, playing in 12 games. He was mostly used as a pinch runner or defensive replacement, but did start one game on the penultimate day of the season. He had just six at bats, getting one hit and stealing two bases.\n\nWilson began the 1977 season at Triple-A Omaha. In what turned out to be his last minor league action (not counting a stunt appearance in 2009), he batted .281 with 74 stolen bases. He was again called up in September, this time receiving more substantial playing time, batting .324 in 34 at bats with 6 steals.\n\n1978 was Wilson's first full season in the majors. He split the left field job with Tom Poquette, Clint Hurdle and Joe Zdeb, getting the most playing time at the position among the four, while also backing up Amos Otis in center field. Overall, he played in 127 games, but had just 198 at bats while batting .217. Despite his limited playing time, he finished fifth in the American League with 46 stolen bases. He also appeared in three games in the 1978 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, starting Game Four.\n\nWilson started the 1979 season as the Royals' fourth outfielder, but by mid-May he had established himself as the team's starting left fielder. He batted .315 and led the league in stolen bases with 83 and singles with 148, while also finishing seventh in hits and third in triples. On defense, he led the league in range factor and putouts and finished second in assists among left fielders.\n\nIn 1980, Wilson started the year as the starting center fielder when Amos Otis opened the season on the disabled list, and acquitted himself well, posting an above-average range factor and making just one error in 195 total chances for the year in center. He moved back to left when Otis returned in late May, and wound up leading the league in several categories. His 705 official at bats were a major league record until it was surpassed by Jimmy Rollins in 2007. He also led the league in hits, runs scored, triples, and singles, finished second in steals with 79, and had at least 100 hits from both sides of the plate. He won both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards, and was fourth in the AL MVP voting, his best finish.\n\nIn the 1980 American League Championship Series, Wilson batted .308 and tied George Brett for the team lead in runs batted in with four as the Royals swept the Yankees in three straight games. In the 1980 World Series, Wilson batted just .154 and struck out against Tug McGraw for the final out of the Royals six-game loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. This strikeout was Wilson's 12th of the Series, breaking the record of 11 held jointly by Eddie Mathews and Wayne Garrett in the 1958 and 1973 World Series, respectively. Ryan Howard would break Wilson's record by striking out 13 times in the 2009 World Series.\n\nWilson's batting average slipped to .303 in the strike-shortened 1981 season, and most of his other numbers were off from the previous two seasons as well. In the 1981 American League Division Series against the Oakland A's, he batted .308, but failed to score a run, steal a base, or get an extra-base hit in the three-game sweep.\n\nIn 1982, Wilson bounced back to bat .332 and win the AL batting title, the first switch hitter to do so since Mickey Mantle in 1956. Although the Royals missed the playoffs for the first time since 1979, Wilson made his first American League All-Star team that year and winning his second Silver Slugger Award. He led the league in singles for the fourth year in a row and in triples for the second time in three seasons.\n\nIn 1983, Wilson moved to center field in June when the club decided to shuffle their outfield, moving long-time center fielder Otis to right field, and moving Pat Sheridan and Leon Roberts, who had been sharing right field, over to left. In the midst of the shuffle, Wilson had his worst season at the plate to date, batting just .276. Although he still finished third in the league with 59 stolen bases and made the All-Star Team for the second time, his on-base percentage and slugging percentage also hit what were to that point career lows at .316 and .352 respectively. However, Wilson's problems in 1983 were not limited to on-field issues.\n\nAfter the end of the 1983 season, Wilson found himself in a drug scandal along with teammates Willie Aikens, Vida Blue, and Jerry Martin. All four pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug charges (attempting to purchase cocaine) on November 17. They became the first active major leaguers to serve jail time, serving 81 days at the Fort Worth, Texas, Federal Correctional Institution. He was suspended by commissioner Bowie Kuhn for the entire 1984 season, but the suspension was reduced on appeal and he was able to return on May 15. The Royals traded or released the other three, with only Wilson returning to the Royals, and he hit .301 and stole 47 bases after his return.\n\nIn 1985, Wilson batted .278 and led the league in triples for the third time with a career-high 21. He also gained a measure of redemption from his 1980 World Series performance, hitting .310 against Toronto in the 1985 ALCS and .367 against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1985 World Series, helping the Royals to their first World Championship.\n\nWilson remained a fixture in the outfield for the Royals over the next five seasons. Although his hitting wasn't what it once was, he still led the league twice more in triples and continued to finish in the top ten in steals, a run of 11 seasons that lasted until 1988, and may have continued if he didn't miss chunks of the 1989 and 1990 season to injuries. He also continued to play well defensively, leading the league in fielding percentage among center fielders in 1987, and among all outfielders in 1990, when he finished the year without a single error.\n\nWilson left the Royals following the 1990 season as a free agent, and he was signed by the Oakland Athletics. There, he took over the role of Félix José, who had been traded late in 1990, as the fourth outfielder behind Rickey Henderson, Dave Henderson and Jose Canseco. He played 113 games, including at least 19 at all three outfield positions, and batted .238.\n\nIn 1992, Dave Henderson missed most of the season with a hamstring injury, leaving Wilson as the starting center fielder. He played in 132 games, his most since 1988, and batted .270. In his first playoff action since the 1985 World Series, he stole seven bases in the 1992 ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Lou Brock's record for steals in one post-season (Brock stole seven bases each in the 1967 and 1968 World Series). He batted just .227, however, and the A's lost the series in six games.\n\nWilson became a free agent again after the 1992 season, and he signed with the Chicago Cubs. He started 1993 in a center field platoon with Dwight Smith, later splitting time with Sammy Sosa when the latter wasn't playing in right field. He batted .258, but managed just seven stolen bases—a career-low for a full season—and he began the 1994 season on the bench behind Tuffy Rhodes. After playing just 17 games that year, he was released on May 16, ending his major league career.\n\nWilson retired with a .285 career batting average and 668 stolen bases, which ranks 12th all-time. For his career, Wilson hit 13 inside-the-park home runs, the most of any major league player playing after 1950. He topped a .300 batting average five times and also led the league in triples five times, being one of only four players to accomplish the feat. Wilson posted a .987 fielding percentage as an outfielder in the majors.\n\nWilson coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system in 1995 and 1997. He was elected to the Royals Hall of Fame in 2000. In 2003, Wilson was named manager of the London Monarchs of the fledgling Canadian Baseball League, but the league folded halfway through the season. Wilson also came out of retirement in 2009, signing a one-day contract with the Kansas City T-Bones, a team playing in the independent Northern League. He currently runs the Willie Wilson Baseball Foundation in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the China—Kyrgyzstan—Kazakhstan tripoint, east of lake Issyk Kul. Its geologic elevation is , but its glacial cap rises to . For this reason, in mountaineering circles, including for the Soviet Snow Leopard award criteria, it is considered a 7,000-metre peak. \n\nKhan Tengri is the second-highest mountain in the Tian Shan, surpassed only by Jengish Chokusu (means \"Victory peak\", formerly known as Peak Pobeda) (7,439 m). Khan Tengri is the highest point in Kazakhstan and the third-highest peak in Kyrgyzstan, after Jengish Chokusu (7,439  m) and Avicenna Peak (7,134 m). It is also the world's most northern 7,000-metre peak, notable because peaks of high latitude have a shorter climbing season, generally more severe weather and thinner air.\n\nThe name \"Khan Tengri\" literally means \"King Heaven\" in Kazakh and possibly references the deity Tengri. In some other local languages, it is known as \"Khan Tangiri Shyngy\", \"Kan-Too Chokusu\", \"Pik Khan-Tengry\", and \"Hantengri Feng\". (, , Han Táńiri, حان تأڭئرئ; , حان-تەڭىرى; ; , Xiao'erjing: هًا تٍْ قْ لِ فعْ). Local residents named the mountain Khan-Tengri for the unique beauty of snow giants. \nKhan Tengri is a massive marble pyramid, covered in snow and ice. At sunset the marble glows red, giving it the name \"blood mountain\" in Kazakh and Kyrgyz (; ). Located just across the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, 16 km north of Jengish Chokusu, Khan Tengri was originally thought to be the highest peak in the Tian Shan because of its dramatic, steep shape, compared to the massive bulk of Jengish Chokusu. This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapaev Peak () and Gorky Peak (). Anatoli Boukreev considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry.\n\nAlthough it is almost 430 m (1,500 ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher.\n\nPeter Semenov was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).\n\nThe first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by Mikhail Pogrebetsky's Ukrainian team by a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964.

{"id": "1915056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915056", "title": "Abrasion (dental)", "text": "Abrasion (dental)\n\nAbrasion is the non-carious, mechanical wears of tooth from interaction with objects other than tooth-tooth contact. It most commonly affects the premolars and canines, usually along the cervical margins. Based on clinical surveys, studies have shown that abrasion is the commonest but not the sole aetiological factor for development of non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) and is most frequently caused by incorrect toothbrushing technique.\n\nAbrasion frequently presents at the cemento-enamel junction and can be caused by many contributing factors, all with the ability to affect the tooth surface in varying degrees.\n\nThe appearance may vary depending on the cause of abrasion, however most commonly presents in a V-shaped caused by excessive lateral pressure whilst tooth-brushing. The surface is shiny rather than carious, and sometimes the ridge is deep enough to see the pulp chamber within the tooth itself.\n\nWith the presence of non-carious cervical loss due to abrasion, this may lead to consequences and symptoms such as increased tooth sensitivity to hot and cold, increased plaque trapping which will result in caries and periodontal disease, difficulty of dental appliances such as retainer and denture in engaging the tooth, and also it may be aesthetically unpleasant to some people.\n\nIn order for successful treatment of abrasion to occur, the cause first needs to be identified and ceased, e.g. overzealous brushing. Once this has occurred subsequent treatment may involve the changes in oral hygiene or toothpaste, application of fluoride to reduce sensitivity or the placement of a restoration to aid in reducing the progression of further tooth loss.\n\nCause of abrasion may arise from interaction of teeth with other objects such as toothbrushes, toothpicks, floss, and ill-fitting dental appliance like retainers and dentures. Apart from that, people with habits such as nail biting, chewing tobacco, lip or tongue piercing, and having occupation such as joiner, are subjected to higher risks of abrasion.\n\nAbrasion can also occur from the type of dentifrice being utilized as some have more abrasive qualities such as whitening toothpastes. The aetiology of dental abrasion can be due to a single stimuli or, as in most cases, multi-factorial. The most common cause of dental abrasion, is the combination of mechanical and chemical wear.\n\nTooth brushing is the most common cause of dental abrasion, which is found to develop along the gingival margin, due to vigorous brushing in this area. The type of toothbrush, the technique used and the force applied when brushing can influence the occurrence and severity of resulting abrasion. Further, brushing for extended periods of time (exceeding 2-3 min) in some cases, when combined with medium/hard bristled toothbrushes can cause abrasive lesions.\n\nDifferent toothbrush types are more inclined to cause abrasion, such as those with medium or hard bristles. The bristles combined with forceful brushing techniques applied can roughen the tooth surface and cause abrasion as well as aggravating the gums. Repetitive irritation to the gingival margin can eventually cause recession of the gums. When the gums recede, the root surface is exposed which is more susceptible to abrasion.\nComparatively, electric toothbrushes have less abrasive tendencies.\n\nTypes of toothpastes can also damage enamel and dentine due to the abrasive properties. Specific ingredients are used in toothpaste to target removal of the bio-film and extrinsic staining however in some cases can contribute to the pastes being abrasive. \nWhitening toothpastes are found to be one of the most abrasive types of toothpastes, according to the RDA Scale, detailed below. In-home and clinical whitening have been proven to increase the likelihood of an individual experiencing dental abrasion. It is believed that dental abrasion due to the whitening process is caused by a combination of both mechanical and chemical irritants, for example, using whitening toothpaste and at home bleaching kits together. However, if an individual is regimented in their after-whitening care then they can avoid loss of dentine minerals and in turn abrasion can be avoided. (that contribute to developing abrasion).\n\nAnother factor that can contribute to abrasion is alteration of pH levels in the saliva. This can be sugary/ acidic foods and liquids. The reasoning behind this is that an increase in acidity of saliva can induce demineralization and therefore compromising the tooth structure to abrasive factors such as tooth brushing or normal wear from mastication. When the tooth structure is compromised, this is where the mineral content of the saliva can create shallow depressions in the enamel and thus, when brushed can cause irreparable damage on tooth surface. The dental abrasion process can be further stimulated and accelerated through the effects of dental Acid erosion.\n\n\"Relative dentin abrasivity\" (\"RDA\") is a standardised measurement of the abrasive effect that the components of the toothpaste have on a tooth.\n\nThe RDA scale was developed by the American Dental Association (ADA). The RDA scale compares toothpaste abrasivity to standard abrasive materials and measures the depth of cut at an average of 1 millimetre per 100,000 brush strokes onto dentine. This comparison generates abrasive values for the dentifrices that would be safe for daily use. In vitro dental studies showed a positive correlation between the highest RDAs and greater dentin wear.\n\nSince 1998, the RDA value is set by the standards DIN EN ISO 11609. Currently, the claim on products such as toothpaste are not regulated by law, however a dentifrice is required to have a level lower than 250 to be considered safe and before being given the ADA seal of approval. The values obtained depend on the size, quantity and surface structure of abrasive used in toothpastes.\n\nWhile the RDA score has been shown to have a statistically significant correlation to the presence of abrasion, it is not the only contributing factor to consider. Other factors such as the amount of pressure used whilst brushing, the type, thickness and dispersion of bristle in the toothbrush and the time spent brushing are other factors that contribute to dental abrasion.\n\nThere are several reasons to treat abrasion lesion(s) (also known as ‘Class V cavity’) such as:-\nIn order for successful treatment of abrasion to occur, the aetiology first needs to be identified. The most accurate way of doing so is completing a thorough medical, dental, social and diet history. All aspects needs to be investigated as in many cases the cause of abrasion can be multi-factorial. Once a definitive diagnosis is completed the appropriate treatment can commence. \nTreatment for abrasion can present in varying difficulties depending on the current degree or progress caused by the abrasion. Abrasion often presents in conjunction with other dental conditions such as attrition, decay and erosion. Evidence suggest there is a decrease in the effect of dental abrasion with dental erosion when fluoride varnish is applied onto teeth. Successful treatment focuses on the prevention and progression on the condition and modifies the current habit/s instigating the condition.\n\nIf the cause of abrasion is due to habitual behaviours, the discontinuation and change of habit is critical in the prevention of further tooth loss. The correct brushing technique is pivotal and involves a gentle scrub technique with small horizontal movements with an extra-soft/soft bristle brush. Excessive lateral force can be corrected by holding the toothbrush in a pen grasp or by using the non-dominant hand to brush. If abrasion is the result of an ill-fitting dental appliance, this should be corrected or replaced by a dental practitioner and should not be attempted in a home setting.\n\nThe current selection of dentifrice should also be critically analysed and changed to include a less abrasive and gentler paste such as sensitive toothpaste as evidence suggests that a very abrasive toothpaste would lead to loss of tooth structure. A toothpaste containing increased fluoride will also help combat the increased sensitivity and risk to dental decay. Fluoride varnish is known to alleviate hypersensitivity in teeth and can be used as a preventive measure for high risk patients of dental erosion with abrasion because fluoride varnish is reported to have an effect on the surface and subsurface of the tooth.\n\nTreatment in the dental chair may include a fluoride application or the placement of a restoration in more severe cases. If the lesion is small and confined to enamel or cementum, a restoration is not warranted, instead the eradication of rough edges should occur to reduce plaque retentive properties. However, in the case of dental decay, aesthetic concerns or defects close to the pulp a restoration may be completed. Further restorative work may be required when the lesion compromises the overall strength of the tooth or when the defect contributes to a periodontal problem the lesion may be restored.\n\nOnce abrasions has been diagnosed and treated it should be closely monitored to identify further progression or potential relief of symptoms.\n\nIdeal properties of restoration materials particularly for these lesions include:-\nThere are other properties of restoration materials which could be considered appropriate, although not specific to Class V restorations, which includes:-\nDental materials such as amalgam, glass ionomer (GI), resin-modified glass ionomer (a variant of GI) and resin composite are the types of restoration materials available when active treatment by means of restoration is appropriate.\n\nTaking into consideration these factors and their respective dental materials' properties, evidence and studies has shown that resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) restoration material is the recommended restoration material in clinical situations as it performs optimally - provided when aesthetics is not the top priority when restoring these lesions. The surface of such lesions should be roughened prior to its restoration - whether material is GI-based or resin-based - with no need for bevelling of the coronal aspect of the cavity.\n\n"}

{"id": "1915085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915085", "title": "Highland Potato Famine", "text": "Highland Potato Famine\n\nThe Highland Potato Famine () was a period of 19th century Highland and Scottish history (1846 to roughly 1856) over which the agricultural communities of the Hebrides and the western Scottish Highlands () saw their potato crop (upon which they had become over-reliant) repeatedly devastated by potato blight. It was part of the wider food crisis facing Northern Europe caused by potato blight during the mid-1840s, whose most famous manifestation is the Great Irish Famine, but compared to its Irish counterpart it was much less extensive (the population seriously at risk was never more than 200,000 - and often much less) and took many fewer lives (prompt and major charitable efforts by the rest of the United Kingdom ensured relatively little starvation). The terms on which charitable relief was given, however, led to destitution and malnutrition amongst its recipients. A government enquiry could suggest no short-term solution other than reduction of the population of the area at risk by emigration to Canada or Australia. Highland landlords organised and paid for the emigration of more than 16,000 of their tenants and a significant but unknown number paid for their own passage. Evidence suggests that the majority of Highlanders who permanently left the famine-struck regions emigrated, rather than moving to other parts of Scotland. It is estimated that about a third of the population of the western Scottish Highlands emigrated between 1841 and 1861.\n\nOver the 18th century, Highland society had changed greatly. On the eastern fringes of the Highlands, most arable land was divided into family farms with 20 to 50 acres employing crofters (with some land held in their own right, insufficient on its own to give them an adequate living) and cottars (farm workers with no land of their own, sometimes sub-let a small patch of land by their employer or a crofter). The economy had become assimilated to that of the Lowlands, whose proximity allowed and encouraged a diverse agriculture. Proximity to the Lowlands had also led to a steady drain of population from these areas. In the Western Isles and the adjacent mainland developments had been very different. Chieftains who had become improving landlords had found livestock-grazing (generally sheep, sometimes cattle) the most remunerative form of agriculture; to accommodate this they had moved their tenants to coastal townships where they hoped valuable industries could be developed and established an extensive crofting system (see Highland Clearances). Croft sizes were set low to encourage the tenantry to participate in the industry (e.g. fishing, kelp ) the landlord wished to develop. A contemporary writer thought that a crofter would have to do work away from his holding for 200 days a year if his family were to avoid destitution. The various industries the crofting townships were supposed to support mostly prospered in the first quarter of the 19th century (drawing workers over and above the originally intended population of townships) but declined or collapsed over its second quarter. The crofting areas were correspondingly impoverished, but able to sustain themselves by a much greater reliance on potatoes (it was reckoned that one acre growing potatoes could support as many people as four acres growing oats). Between 1801 and 1841 the population in the crofting area increased by over half, whereas in the eastern and southern Highlands the increase in the same period was under 10 percent. Consequently, immediately pre-blight, whilst mainland Argyll had over two acres of arable land per inhabitant, there was only half an acre of arable land per head in Skye and Wester Ross: in the crofting area, as in Ireland, the population had grown to levels which only a successful potato harvest could support.\n\nIn the Scottish Highlands, in 1846, there was widespread failure of potato crops as a result of potato blight. Crops failed in about three-quarters of the crofting region, putting a population of about 200,000 at risk; the following winter was especially cold and snowy and the death rate rose significantly. The Free Church of Scotland, strong in the affected areas, was prompt in raising the alarm and in organising relief, being the only body actively doing so in late 1846 and early 1847; relief was given regardless of denomination. Additionally, the Free Church organised transport for over 3,000 men from the famine-struck regions to work on the Lowland railways. This both removed people who needed to be fed from the area and provided money for their families to buy food. \n\nThe British government took early notice of the crop failure. They were approached for assistance by landowners at the end of the summer of 1846, but any direct subsidies to the landlords were ruled out, as this would have relieved them of their responsibilities to their tenants. Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Assistant Secretary to the Treasury (effectively the senior civil servant at this department) provided the lead. The government was restricted by the common attitudes of the middle of the 19th century: minimal intervention, and there was deep concern to avoid upsetting the free play of normal market forces. Despite the constraints of these ruling economic theories, Trevelyan made completely clear that \"the people cannot, \"under any circumstances\", be allowed to starve\" in a letter of September 1846.\n\nThe government's first action was to ensure that Highland landlord met their responsibilities to provide famine relief to their tenants. Landlord response varied. Some had both the resources and the willingness to do this. Others, typically among the remaining hereditary landowners, were in perilous financial conditions and struggled to meet expectations, some of them being in denial about their lack of ability to do so. The last class, those who had the means to fund relief for their tenants, but chose not to, were put under substantial pressure by the government. Senior relief officers made personal inspections of their properties (the Royal Navy had a steamer to provide transport for this). Formal exhortations were made over the winter of 1846 to those who still did not comply. Threats were added that the government would recover the costs of relief they had provided, even by selling part of the problem estates. By the summer of 1847, even the notorious Colonel John Gordon of Cluny was being acknowledged by the senior relief officer, Sir Edward Pine Coffin as having improved beyond the worst class of landlord.\n\nThe government stationed two meal depots at Portree and Tobermory in the winter of 1846-7 and based a team of relief officers in the affected areas. The depots sold meal only at market prices - any hint of a subsidy went against free market principles. However, the purpose in establishing the depots was to prevent spiralling prices due to local shortages - thereby demonstrating the dilemma in choosing practical, necessary measures that fitted with the contemporary views on political economy. Existing legislation was examined for ways of providing help. Innovative measures were shunned for fear of expanding the role of government. Discretion was allowed to Inspectors of the Poor in providing meal to recipients of casual relief for destitute families. A much larger use of current law was the active encouragement of landowners to apply for loans under the Drainage and Public Works Act. After some extensive streamlining of the cumbersome application process, this channelled money to landlords that allowed them to employ their tenantry to improve the land that they rented. \n\nFollowing on from the Free Church's voluntary efforts, relief committees were set up in Edinburgh in December 1846 and Glasgow in January 1847. By February 1847, the Free Church and the Edinburgh and Glasgow groups combined to form the Central Board of Management for Highland Relief. By the end of 1847 the Relief Committees had raised about £210,000 (roughly equivalent in purchasing power to £17m in 2018) to support relief work. Other groups to organise relief work included the British Relief Association; its efforts were coordinated by Lord Kinnaird and the Earl of Dalhousie. News of the famine led the Scottish diaspora, including Scottish-Americans, to organise relief efforts. The prompt response of the Lowlands (and the much smaller size of the problem) meant that famine relief programmes were better organised and more effective in the Scotland than in Ireland. As in Ireland the export of foodstuffs was not prohibited and in Inverness, Wick, Cromarty and Invergordon, troops were used to quell protests about the \"export\" of grain or potatoes from local harbours.\n\nIn 1847 the crop failure was less extensive, and death rates had returned to normal; thereafter the government left famine relief to the Central Board. Crop failures continued, but at a reduced level, and the charitable relief programme only ceased upon the near-exhaustion of its funds. One modern historian summarises its evolution: \"... gradually it took on the worst features of mid-Victorian philanthropy. At once autocratic and bureaucratic, the Board became a gradgrind employer, paying rock bottom wages in kind for hard labour on public works... \". Relief was not available to those with any disposable capital (which was interpreted to include livestock). The daily ration (of oatmeal or Indian meal) was initially set by the Central Board at per man, per woman and per child. Recipients were expected to work for their rations, leading to the building of \"destitution roads\" and other public works of little (if any) real value. This requirement was not rigorously enforced at first, but potato crops failed to recover to pre-blight levels, and the Central Board became concerned that long-term recipients of the rations would become \"pauperised\". Eleemosynary aid… would be a curse instead of a benefit; and hence it was absolutely necessary to teach the people of the Highlands that they must depend on their resources for the future. To accomplish this object it would be requisite to instruct them in croft husbandry, in developing the treasures of the deep, and in prosecuting the manufacture of kelp. To encourage them to stand on their own feet, the ration was reduced (e.g. to per man), and it would only be given to those doing a full eight-hour day's work. This \"destitution test\", harsh in itself, implemented by Victorian bureaucracy, and policed by officials used to enforcing naval discipline, engendered considerable hostility.\n\nBy 1850, the relief funds were almost exhausted and, with potato blight persisting, there was a growing sense (even within the relief committees) that long-term solutions were needed; the provision of short-term aid had delayed these being adopted. The Destitution Relief Boards announced that their operations would cease at the end of September 1850. In doing so, they expressed two concerns: if the potato crop failed again things would be as bad as in 1846; on the other hand, if the 1850 crop was largely unaffected, the Highlanders would not learn the lesson that the blight should teach them and revert to their old ways, and four years' effort to diversify their sources of food and of income would have gone to waste.\n\nThere were again considerable failures of the potato crop in 1850, and the question then naturally arose as to how the distressed population were to be supported. The Scottish Poor Laws, unlike those in England, allowed relief to be given from the parish poor rates only to the sick and infirm and explicitly forbade any relief being given to the able-bodied poor unable to find work locally. As early as 1848 Sir Charles Trevelyan had advocated that the Scottish Poor Law be amended to allow the able-bodied poor to claim relief; critics countered that the scale of destitution was such that it was clearly unrealistic to expect a large number of unemployed in a distressed parish to be supported solely by rates levied on that parish.\nIn response to inquiries from county officials, the government indicated that it did not intend to make additional funds available now that the charitable relief effort had ended, neither to provide relief \"in situ\" nor to assist emigration from distressed areas. It suggested that a Poor Law clause giving the Poor Law authorities discretion to grant relief to those temporarily unable to work might (somewhat contrary to its wording) be used to provide relief to the able-bodied poor willing but unable to find work. It set up an enquiry under Sir John McNeill, the chairman of the Board of Supervision (of Scottish Poor Law Boards), to investigate the situation and recommend remedies.\n\nHaving carried out his enquiry from February to April 1851, Sir John made his report in July 1851. He ascribed the current difficulties to the sub-division of crofts (or, amounting to the same thing, more than one family being supported by a single croft) in times of prosperity, and to the insularity of the Highlanders. When the kelp industry had collapsed they surely would have sought work elsewhere had they not been separated by habits and language from the majority of the population and regarded the rest of the kingdom as a foreign country. Such emigration as had taken place had been of the prosperous; in replacing them the landlords had discovered tacksmen operating large grazings to be willing to pay higher rents and more reliable in paying them. That discovery had led them to move crofters to more marginal areas to create more grazings.\nThere had been no known deaths by starvation since the cessation of Relief Board operations (to put those in proportion, he noted that total expenditure by the Relief Board on Skye in 1850 was less than half the value of taxed whisky sales on Skye in 1850, gratuitously going on to note that the latter was more than double the value of sales in 1846) and the predicted humanitarian crisis had not materialised. On Skye, where the parochial boards had been giving discretionary relief to the able-bodied in response to the end of Relief Board Operations even before government guidance: \nthe working classes, disabused of the notion that the eleemosynary aid they had been receiving for some years would be permanent, and thrown upon the local resources and their own exertions, have hitherto surmounted the danger, with an amount of relief absolutely trifling. No doubt, suffering must have been endured, the pressure upon all classes must have been severe: but to the latest date to which intelligence has been received, there is no sufficient reason to believe that one life has yet been lost in consequence of the cessation of eleemosynary relief\nConsequently, he concluded that the programme of extensive relief to the able-bodied poor, although well-intentioned, had ultimately been deleterious. He made no recommendation for changes to the Scottish Poor Law to give the able-bodied poor a right to claim parish relief, but recommended all parochial boards to give discretionary relief.\nVarious schemes of improvement had been attempted locally to relieve destitution and had been urged upon him as deserving wider adoption. However, the areas less badly affected by destitution were not those where these schemes had been attempted, but rather those where communications with the rest of the country were relatively good, where there was greater acceptance of seasonal migration in search of work, or where there were significant other sources of income. There was widespread agreement, therefore, that in the short term, prompt and widespread emigration was necessary to the well-being of the population and to their extrication from their current difficulties. Parliament should therefore authorise loans to assist immigration as they had formerly loans to assist improvements in the distressed areas.\n\nWith the population reduced, the area could be made more resilient against future crises by giving crofters greater security of tenure (so giving them some incentive for agricultural improvement), by instruction in agriculture and the management of stock, and by better education. \"Increased and improved means of education would tend to enlighten the people and to fit them for seeking their livelihood in distant places, as well as tend to break the bonds that now confine them to their native localities\", but education should not simply be in the \"three Rs\"; it should also seek to excite a desire for knowledge in which respect education in the Highlands was currently deficient.\n\nThis led to the creation by January 1852 of the Highland and Island Emigration Society by Trevelyan and McNeill .\n\nBlight returned year after year, but never to the same extent as in 1846. As late as 1854, the complete loss of the potato crop was being reported for local blackspots such as the Hebridean communities of Barra and Harris (where the blight was said to be more prevalent than in 1846). In subsequent years blight was usually reported in various localities, but it was always only partial and never as bad as first feared: \"There is some clamour about the potato blight but ... the fear is greater than the hurt\". On Lewis, Sir James Matheson had spent £33,000 in three years to support his tenants; in six of the next thirty years he had to provide similar help, but on a much smaller scale and with a greater likelihood of being repaid: \nMost landlords worked to lessen the effects of the famine on their crofting tenants; forgoing rent, donating to the relief committees, running their own parallel relief operations, funding the introduction of new crops and industries or reviving old ones. However, as it became apparent that crofting at current population levels had long-term problems, they feared that the government would impose some system of permanent relief charged against their estates (either directly or through Poor Law reform). They instead sought to solve or remove the problems by inducing their poorer tenants to migrate to the Lowlands, or emigrate overseas. \n\nThere was theoretical support on the problem of excess population from the work of Malthus, and this certainly had an influence on the management of the Duke of Sutherland's estate. His factor in the Scourie district (Evander McIver) worked both to persuade the landlord to subsidise emigration and to encourage the tenantry to accept the assistance offered. Whilst the second Duke of Sutherland effectively forbade eviction to achieve this, the influence of favourable reports from previous emigrants, coupled with the level of destitution in the community acted as a stimulus for people to leave. Extreme poverty acted as a barrier to emigration - emphasising the importance of financial assistance from the landlord.\n\nThe crofting areas lost about a third of their population between the early 1840s and the late 1850s; losses were higher in the Hebrides and remoter areas of the mainland such as Ardnamurchan with over 40% of inhabitants being evicted by 1856 Some landlords contributed towards 'assisted' emigration (under which over 16,000 crofters were shipped overseas to Canada and Australia), others encouraged their tenants to move by taking a harder line on rent arrears, turf-cutting rights and other practices on which tenants had traditionally been allowed some leeway, but - since crofters had no security of tenure - landlords could simply evict their superfluous tenants. Pine Coffin became alarmed by the extent of evictions in 1848-9, warning of 'the unsettling of the very foundations of the social system'. On Lewis the large-scale voluntary emigration to Canada from the Matheson estates was encouraged by both the carrot (promises of good treatment of volunteers) and the stick (reminders to tenants of their rent arrears and the possibility of their eviction). A witness of it said in the 1880s \"it was voluntary, but everybody knew they had to go, even if they didn't want to\"\n\nBarra was a particularly hard case and in due course a \"cause celebre\"; it had been prosperous, but the hereditary McNeill proprietor had set up a kelp works which had drawn in outsiders; the works had proved uneconomic and to meet its losses the crofters' rents had been raised to unsustainable levels. The kelp works were abandoned, but the high rents retained. 'The poverty of the people is beyond description' wrote their parish priest in 1830. Despite the high rents, McNeill went bankrupt and his trustees in bankruptcy seized and sold most of the islanders' livestock (their main source of income) to pay rent arrears. Barra itself ended up in the hands of John Gordon of Cluny \"the richest commoner in Scotland\"(he died worth £2m in 1858). Colonel Gordon (he was a colonel in the Aberdeenshire Militia ) was notoriously parsimonious in his personal habits but he authorised his factor to reduce rents to realistic levels and attempted various schemes (most notably a deep-water fishery) to improve the lot of the islanders (and his income from the island). These schemes met with little cooperation (and in some cases active opposition) from the islanders, and came to nothing: by 1850 Gordon had owned Barra for ten years, and seen no return for his money. Consequently, the islanders were still both poor and heavily dependent on potatoes. Furthermore, their landlord had no sentimental ties to them or the island, and held that the islanders were largely the authors of their own misfortune: if they had supported his improvements they would not find themselves dependent on the benevolence of others. \n\nPotato blight destroyed any possibility of Barra being self-sufficient. In November 1850 it was reported of that year's cereal crop that \"it might give about 453 bolls of meal, or what would be adequate to the support of the population for about two months; whilst even then there were families who did not possess so many pecks of meal as there were persons in them.\n2 Consequently, the islanders became dependent on the benevolence of others to an extraordinary extent: in 1850 1965 of a population of 2300 received relief. \nGordon attempted to consolidate small crofts into larger holdings better able to support their tenants (his version) or to reduce the number of destitute islanders he would have to support (the view taken by his critics). Some Barra islanders appeared, penniless, ragged, and unable to speak English on the streets of Glasgow just before Christmas 1850 . The tale told on their behalf was that they were only a small part of 132 families evicted from their holdings in May 1850; they squatted on waste land only to be evicted when relief operations ceased in September 1850. They excited public sympathy and Gordon became the target of criticism in Scottish newspapers for having them removed first from their homes and secondly from the island of their birth; the criticism intensified when he indicated he had no intention of assisting them. Gordon denied that he had had anybody evicted \"at this inclement time of year\" and denied all knowledge of why they had left Barra; he would welcome further enquiry as it would show the truth of the matter. He replied to criticism by letting it be known that, prior to the evictions, he had cooperated with the Relief Committee, given them £1000 and spent nearly £2300 in relieving distress in the island; he declared himself willing to lay out more money if anyone could show him where it might effect lasting good. \n\nThe Barra islanders who reached Glasgow do not appear to have given interviews to journalists (and were subsequently claimed by the Barra Parochial Board to have left Barra in July and to be known bad characters). A subsequent party arrived at Inverness and talked to a Gaelic-speaking journalist, giving an account which was markedly different but not significantly more favourable to Gordon. The Inverness party said they had been moved from their crofts two-three years ago: \"Ejectments were made illegally. No summonses of removal were served, nor any steps taken before the judge ordinary, or any other. The bare authority of Colonel Gordon, in a letter to the ground-officer, was that on which their houses were pulled about their ears, to make way for the large farmers to whom their crofts were let\" They had been moved to infertile land; their crops were small or blighted, and they had been living on relief. When the Destitution Board had ceased operation, Gordon had taken over relief, but with inferior and unpalatable meal. They had not been evicted from the island; indeed Gordon's factor had refused them any assistance to leave the island - not even any meal for the journey. They were however convinced that Gordon was deliberately trying to 'disgust them into' leaving. (In contrast to the treatment they had had from Gordon and his agents, they had reached Inverness through multiple kindnesses: An Irish merchant on Barra had given them provisions, the captain of a Board of Northern Lights lighthouse tender had kindly taken them to Tobermory, the townsfolk of Tobermory had fed them lodged them and given them money to pay their fare to Oban; the captain of the Tobermory-Oban packet had refused payment, the people of Oban \"had outdone those of Tobermory in generosity\" .. and so on.) \nIn 1851, the Parochial Board of Barra reported that over half the population wished to emigrate if only they had the means. In May they told the Board of Supervision that they did not have the funds to continue relief to the able-bodied poor - the Board wrote back to say it was their responsibility to do so. Gordon chartered ships and offered free passage to Quebec to his tenants in Barra and South Uist (and to those recently evicted). About 1700 people availed themselves of the offer, but on arrival at Quebec some members of the last shipload signed a statement that they had been induced to emigrate by promises by their landlord (free onward passage to Upper Canada, guaranteed work, the possibility of free land grants) which they now found were illusory. They said twenty of those on the ship had wanted to change their mind about emigrating, but had been dragooned onto the ship by Gordon's factor and a police constable. The emigrants arrived on board half-starving and half-naked (some children \"were\" naked \"Many children of nine and ten years old had not a rag to cover them . Mrs Crisp the wife of the master of ...(the ship) ... was employed the whole of the voyage converting empty bread-bags, old canvases and blankets into coverings for them\"). They arrived in Quebec unable to support themselves and without any means of paying for passage to Upper Canada (where they might be able to find work); the Canadian authorities had to lay out £670 to get them there. Because they had not sailed until August, they arrived too late to be properly settled before the onset of a Canadian winter, for which they remained unprepared. The Vice-President of a Scottish benevolent society in Hamilton, Upper Canada wrote \"the emigrants from Barra and South Uist, amounting to between two and three thousand were the most destitute I ever saw coming to this country. They were actually in a state of nudity on their arrival here and were utterly helpless\"\n\nThe lot of the emigrants from Gordon of Cluny's estates was woeful, and drew a letter of complaint from the Canadian authorities to Gordon's factor but both that letter and contemporary newspaper reports made a comparison with the better treatment of emigrants from other Highland estates by their former landlords. \"The Lewis men were provided ... not only with clothing for the voyage, and a free passage to Quebec, but with a week's rations after arrival … and a free passage to their ultimate destination\" Emigrants from the Duke of Sutherland's estates arrived well clad and fed and with money to buy and stock farms; where their own savings were inadequate the Duke had gifted them money\n\nMcNeill's report did not endorse the argument of papers such as the \"Scotsman\" that the destitution was due to the inherent laziness of the Gael (which contrasted unfavourably with the estimable traits of the 'Teutonic' Lowland Scots who read the \"Scotsman\"), but his comments on the cultural barriers which had hindered timely migration from the congested areas mirrored and reinforced a prevalent assumption that Gaelic culture and language was an unnecessary brake on progress and the long-term happiness and prosperity of the Gaelic-speaking areas could best be secured by making them English-speaking. Two decades after the famine the \"Edinburgh Courant\" noted emigration from Hebridean islands, which was the best cure for their ills, was accelerated by education: \"It is startling enough to be asked to establish and maintain a school system for the purpose of depopulating a district, but we have little doubt this would be the first effect and the best success of the thorough education of the Hebrides\". Consequently, on the other hand \"There is still a prejudice among some of the old people against any but Gaelic education, because they see that it gives their children wings with which they can fly away from the family nest\".\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the famine government resisted arguments that it should subsidise a railway to Oban in order to reduce the isolation of the Hebrides. Only in 1880 did the Caledonian Railway eventually reach Oban as a purely commercial venture. In 1867 the inhabitants of Stornaway got their mail \"via\" a twice-weekly steamer from Greenock . Consequently, it took 74 to 132 hours for letters to reach Stornaway from Edinburgh or London, and any reply had to wait half a week for the next steamer. Complaints that Stornaway was worse served than some other islands were denied by their inhabitants; letters posted in London took as long to reach Barra as they would to reach Bombay. Services to Skye and Lewis improved when the Dingwall and Skye Railway reached Stromeferry in 1870 and began steamer services from a pier there. More generally, better steamships and more frequent services eventually allowed better communication, and the recovery of fishing and cattle-rearing and the greater ease of temporary migration for seasonal work eventually allowed the crofting economy to move from self-sufficiency to one in which enough cash was generated to allow the purchase of imported grain.\n\nIn the 1880s, the technical issue of how to avoid future famines or seasons of destitution in the Highlands became submerged in the political question of how to address the grievances of crofters and cottars (agricultural labourers without land). Landlords had taken to heart McNeill's comments on the need to prevent uncontrolled population growth in crofting areas by preventing sub-division or multiple occupancy of crofts; they had taken much less notice of his view that crofters should be granted secure leases. Consequently, there was growing resentment amongst the crofting communities. In 1882 there were failures of both the potato and cereal harvests in the Hebrides (because of blight and wind damage, respectively); this led to widespread destitution in 1883. There was also unrest among the crofters and formation of a Highland Land League which took its inspiration from the Irish Land League. The Gladstone Government set up the Napier Commission (a \"Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands\" under Lord Napier ) to identify remedies. Napier's report in 1884 recommended security of tenure for crofters paying rents of over £6 a year (of whom there were few) and voluntary emigration for the rest of the population. Napier's recommendations were at odds with the measures adopted in Ireland to resolve the Irish 'land question' and the subsequent Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 was more influenced by the Irish precedents than by the Napier Commission report. In the General Election of 1885, 5 Highland seats had elected 'Independent Liberal' MPs endorsed by the Highland Land League (\"the Crofters' Party\") and thereafter political considerations heavily influenced the Liberal approach to the problems of the crofting region.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1915099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915099", "title": "Pat Haden", "text": "Pat Haden\n\nPatrick Capper Haden (born January 23, 1953) is the former athletic director at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles from August 2010 to June 2016. He played quarterback for the USC Trojans before playing professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Los Angeles Rams from 1976 through 1981. He also played in the World Football League (WFL) for the Southern California Sun in 1975.\n\nHaden is a Rhodes Scholar, was a practicing attorney from 1982 to 1987, and was a partner at Riordan, Lewis & Haden, a private equity firm, from 1987 to 2010. He is also known for his work as a former sportscaster, beginning with CBS Sports in 1982, and ending his career in that field as a color commentator for NBC Sports' Notre Dame football coverage.\n\nBorn in Westbury, New York, to working-class Irish American parents, Haden is the fourth of five children. He had a close relationship with his mother, Helen Haden, who told her children to \"Live your life so that you have standing room only at your funeral.\"\n\nAs a boy, Haden had a boyhood paper route, then worked at a shoe store where he also pushed accessories in order to earn an extra commission. He had the same mentality in sports, where he used smarts and toughness he gained from keeping up with his older brothers to compensate for physical shortcomings. By high school, his parents had moved to Southern California.\n\nHaden played high school football at Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, where he became starting quarterback. He became close friends with teammate J.K. McKay, son of then-USC football coach John McKay; the two were opposites: J.K. was quick-witted and easygoing, while Haden was not. Haden and McKay shared the CIF Southern Section Player of the Year award in 1970. When Haden's parents had to move again, he stayed with the McKays for his senior year of high school. He was highly sought after and was recruited by many schools, including Notre Dame. Haden was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nPrior to College Football Haden and McKay won the CIF championship game in overtime against Lakewood High School. The game was played at the LA Coliseum, where Haden would go on to lead the Trojans to many victories.\n\nHaden and J.K. McKay joined the highly regarded USC Trojans under head coach John McKay; they joined a group of friends in living at an apartment building just off campus. At USC, he made it to three Rose Bowl appearances and won two national championships. In the final game of his college career, the 1975 Rose Bowl, he was named co-Most Valuable Player. Haden also was a recipient of the Today's Top V Award in 1975, which at the time honored five (now ten) senior student-athletes. He was put into the GTE Academic All-American Hall of Fame in 1988. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1995. An athletic and academic stand-out, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship.\n\nIn 1973, he threw for 1,832 yards with 13 TD vs 11 INT. In 1974, he threw for just 988 yards (in part due to 98 fewer pass attempts) but still threw 13 TD vs 11 INT.\n\nHaden played one season in the World Football League, its last, for the Southern California Sun, which allowed him to attend school in England at Oxford University under his Rhodes Scholarship. His decision to go to the United Kingdom for schooling hurt his NFL possibilities, as did a lack of height () and arm strength, and he dropped to the seventh round of the NFL Draft.\n\nHaden made the Los Angeles Rams' roster in 1976 as the third quarterback, behind James Harris and Ron Jaworski. When both Harris and Jaworski were injured, Haden was pressed into duty in the second game of the season. Haden responded by playing mostly mistake-free football, letting running backs Lawrence McCutcheon and John Cappelletti shoulder the offensive load and passing only occasionally. Harris returned to the lineup as starting quarterback and Haden went back to a backup role. In a Monday night game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Harris played poorly in a 20-12 loss, and Rams head coach Chuck Knox was ordered by team owner Carroll Rosenbloom to bench Harris in favor of Haden. This is documented in Knox's autobiography \"Hard Knox: The Life of an NFL Coach\" and William Rhoden's \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback\". At the time of the quarterback change, Harris was the top-rated passer of the National Football Conference. The NFL records show that Harris finished as the NFC's top-rated passer of 1976. Despite the change, the Rams went on to win the NFC Western Division title and a 14–12 upset of the defending NFC champion Dallas Cowboys in the opening round of the NFC playoffs, but the Rams fell to the Minnesota Vikings in the .\n\nThe Rams revamped their quarterback position for the 1977 season. Harris and Jaworski were traded, and the Rams acquired veteran QB Joe Namath from the New York Jets. Namath started the first four games, but it was evident his knees couldn't take it anymore, so the Rams went back to Haden. The Rams took eight victories in the last 10 games, won the NFC West and made the playoffs again. Their first-round opponent was the Vikings at home in the rain, but the Rams lost 14–7 in the . Haden's small hands impaired his ability to grip the wet muddy ball. Haden completed 14 of 32 passes for 130 yards and one touchdown with 3 interceptions while Viking QB Bob Lee was only able to complete 5 of 10 passes for 57 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\nHaden was rewarded with the starting position from day one in 1978. The Rams started fast, winning their first eight games, but tailed off to 12-4, and won their third straight NFC West Division title. Haden threw a pair of touchdown passes and led the Rams to a 34-10 victory against the Vikings in the first round of the playoffs. The defending champion Dallas Cowboys walloped the Rams 28-0 in the on their way to Super Bowl XIII. Haden was voted the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club NFC Player of the Year of the 1978 season.\n\nHaden began the 1979 season as the starter, but a broken finger midway through the season sidelined him in favor of Vince Ferragamo, who led the Rams to Super Bowl XIV.\n\nBecause of Rams' coach Ray Malavasi's policy of giving an injured starter his job back, Haden began the 1980 season as the starter with Ferragamo as the backup. Haden was injured in the Rams season opener against the Detroit Lions. Ferragamo took over as the starter and didn't relinquish the job (despite Haden returning mid-season), passing for a then Rams-record 30 touchdown passes.\n\nFerragamo, however, bolted the Rams for the Canadian Football League. Haden went into the 1981 season as starter, but was injured midway through the season. After the season, while recovering from knee surgery and contemplating retirement, he got a call from CBS about a broadcast job and decided to take it.\n\nAfter spending a few years at CBS, Haden was hired as the color commentator for NBC Sports' coverage of Notre Dame college football, and held similar duties for their Arena Football coverage from 2003 through 2006 and Fox Sports' Bowl Championship Series coverage in 2008. His position as the Notre Dame color commentator is ironic in that he, as USC's quarterback in 1974, helped orchestrate one of Notre Dame's greatest losses (and, conversely, one of USC's greatest wins, known as \"The Comeback\"). The Trojans won 55–24 despite trailing 24–0 at one point and 24–6 at halftime. Haden admits that his mother wanted him to go to Notre Dame and always lights a candle in her memory at the grotto whenever he is on campus.\n\nHaden also was a color man for CBS Sports' college football coverage (being one of a three-man booth with former Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian and play-by-play man Brent Musburger, and later working with Jim Nantz), and provided color commentary for TNT's Sunday night football coverage and Westwood One's radiocasts, primarily working the Sunday night schedule which immediately followed his TV commitments (at the time, TNT and ESPN split the Sunday night games between them, with TNT broadcasting the first half of the season and ESPN the second half).\n\nHaden also called one NFL on CBS game in 1988 and some NFL on CBS games in 1989 during the busier weeks of the 1988 NFL Season and 1989 NFL Season, when the network's seven announcing teams weren't enough to cover the network games.\n\nIn 1987, he joined Riordan, Lewis & Haden, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles that focuses on making investments in growing, profitable businesses with $20 – 200 million in revenue. He has served as a director of a number of RLH portfolio companies including TetraTech, Systems Management Specialists, Data Processing Resources Corporation (formerly NASDAQ: DPRC), The Apothecary Shops, and Adohr Farms. Haden remained a partner at RLH until assuming the position of Athletic Director for the University of Southern California.\n\nHaden replaced Mike Garrett as the USC Trojans athletic director on August 3, 2010. On September 8, 2014, he and USC football coach Steve Sarkisian were reprimanded by Pac-12 Conference commissioner Larry Scott for attempting \"to influence the officiating, and ultimately the outcome of a contest\" during the September 6 game with Stanford. Haden was fined $25,000. On October 11, 2015, Haden placed Sarkisian on leave after a series of incidents culminating in the coach missing a practice during the season. The next day, Haden announced that Sarkisian had been fired.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, Haden announced that he would be stepping down as USC's athletic director effective June 30.\n\nHaden was one of 13 members of the inaugural College Football Playoff selection committee. In September 2014 Haden received criticism and calls to resign from the selection committee by charging onto the field in order to argue with officials regarding a series of penalties during the third quarter of USC's 13-10 victory against Stanford.\n\nHaden received a B.A., magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Southern California, a J.D. from Loyola Law School and a B.A. in economics from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nHaden has served on numerous nonprofit boards. He sits on the boards of the Rose Hills Foundation and the Fletcher Jones Foundation, and has also served on the boards of non-profit organizations including the University of Southern California, the Good Samaritan Hospital, Boys Town of Southern California, the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Los Angeles, and the Crippled Children's Society of Los Angeles. He is former chair of the March of Dimes Reading Olympics in Los Angeles and the Boys Life National Illiteracy Campaign.\n\nHaden is a Board Member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Ronnie Lott and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.\n\nHaden was awarded the Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission in 2003 for his community involvement.\n"}

{"id": "1915104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915104", "title": "Redburn", "text": "Redburn\n\nRedburn: His First Voyage is the fourth book by the American writer Herman Melville, first published in London in 1849. The book is semi-autobiographical and recounts the adventures of a refined youth among coarse and brutal sailors and the seedier areas of Liverpool. Melville wrote \"Redburn\" in less than ten weeks. While one scholar describes it as \"arguably his funniest work\", scholar F. O. Matthiessen calls it \"the most moving of its author's books before \"Moby-Dick\"\".\n\nUnable to find employment at home, young Wellingborough Redburn signs on the \"Highlander\", a merchantman out of New York City bound for Liverpool, England. Representing himself as the \"son of a gentleman\" and expecting to be treated as such, he discovers that he is just a green hand, a \"boy\", the lowest rank on the ship, assigned all the duties no other sailor wants, like cleaning out the \"pig-pen\", a longboat that serves as a shipboard sty. The first mate promptly nicknames him \"Buttons\" for the shiny ones on his impractical jacket. Redburn quickly grasps the workings of social relations aboard ship. As a common seaman he can have no contact with those \"behind the mast\" where the officers command the ship. Before the mast, where the common seaman work and live, a bully named Jackson, the best seaman aboard, rules through fear with an iron fist. Uneducated yet cunning, with broken nose and squinting eye, he is described as \"a Cain afloat, branded on his yellow brow with some inscrutable curse and going about corrupting and searing every heart that beat near him.\" Redburn soon experiences all the trials of a greenhorn: seasickness, scrubbing decks, climbing masts in the dead of night to unfurl sails, cramped quarters, and bad food. \n\nWhen the ship lands in Liverpool he is given liberty ashore. He rents a room and walks the city every day. One day in a street called Launcelott's Hey he hears \"a feeble wail\" from a cellar beneath an old warehouse and looking into it sees \"the figure of what had been a woman. Her blue arms folded to her livid bosom two shrunken things like children, that leaned toward her, one on each side. At first I knew not whether they were alive or dead. They made no sign; they did not move or stir; but from the vault came that soul-sickening wail.\" He runs for help but is met with indifference by a ragpicker, a porter, his landlady, even by a policeman who tells him to mind his own business. He returns with some bread and cheese and drops them into the vault to the mother and children, but they are too weak to lift it to their mouths. The mother whispers \"water\" so he runs and fills his tarpaulin hat at an open hydrant. The girls drink and revive enough to nibble some cheese. He clasps the mother's arms and pulls them aside to see \"a meager babe, the lower part of its body thrust into an old bonnet. Its face was dazzlingly white, even in its squalor; but the closed eyes looked like balls of indigo. It must have been dead for some hours.\" Judging them beyond the point at which medicine could help, he returns to his room. A few days later he revisits the street and finds the vault empty: \"In place of the woman and children, a heap of quick-lime was glistening.\"\n\nOn the docks he meets Harry Bolton, a dandy who claims to be a sailor looking for a job, and Redburn helps him procure a berth on the \"Highlander\" for the return voyage. They become fast friends and make a trip to London where they visit a luxurious private club, Aladdin's Palace, with an exotic environment Redburn struggles to make sense of, concluding it must be a gambling house. The ship soon departs for New York and Bolton's deficits as sailor become apparent. Redburn suspects that Bolton has never been to sea before and Bolton is tormented by the crew. Jackson, after being ill in bed for four weeks, returns to active duty: he climbs to the topsail yard, then suddenly vomits \"a torrent of blood from his lungs\", and falls headfirst into the sea and disappears. The crew never speak his name again. Reaching port, Redburn heads for his home and Bolton signs on a whaler. Redburn later hears that Bolton, far out in the Pacific, fell over the side and drowned.\n\n\nMelville alluded to \"Redburn\" for the first time in a letter to his English publisher in the late spring of 1849, in which he wrote that the novel would be practical rather than follow the \"unwise\" course of his previous novel, \"Mardi\", which had been harshly criticized:\nMelville adopted this more commercial approach to writing as his family obligations increased and his working conditions became more difficult. Living with him in the small house in New York City were his wife, child, mother, sisters, and his brother Allen with \"his\" wife and child. Melville later portrayed himself at this time as being forced to write \"with duns all around him, & looking over the back of his chair—& perching on his pen & diving in his inkstand—like the devils about St. Anthony.\"\n\nThe book is a fictional narrative based loosely on Melville's own first voyage to Liverpool in 1839. The manuscript was completed in less than ten weeks and, without any attempt at polishing it, Melville submitted it to his American publisher Harper & Bros who published it in November 1849. Melville checked the proof sheets, which came out in August, and sent them along to Bentley for publication in England, where it appeared six weeks before the American version. In 1922 it was published as a volume of the Constable edition of Melville's complete works. Since then it has been continuously in print in inexpensive hard cover editions and since 1957 in paperback.\n\nMelville referred to \"Redburn\" and his next book \"White-Jacket\" as \"two \"jobs\" which I have done for money—being forced to it as other men are to sawing wood\". It was reviewed favorably in all the influential publications, American and British, with many critics hailing it as Melville's return to his original style. The critics were divided along national lines when reviewing the scene in Launcelots Hey, the British dubbing it \"improbable\", the Americans \"powerful\". In 1884 William Clark Russell, the most popular writer of sea stories in his generation, praised the book's force and accuracy in print. He also sent Melville a personal letter where, among other items, he said \"I have been reading your \"Redburn\" for the third or fourth time and have closed it more deeply impressed with the descriptive power that vitalises every page.\" John Masefield would later single the book out as his favorite of Melville's works. When \"Redburn\" was praised, Melville wrote in his journal, \"I, the author, know [it] to be trash, & wrote it to buy some tobacco with\". He later complained: \"What I feel most moved to write, that is banned—it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the \"other\" way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches.\"\n\nElizabeth Hardwick finds that passages of the book display a rhetorical brilliance: \"Throughout Melville's writings there is a liberality of mind, a freedom from vulgar superstition, occasions again and again for an oratorical insertion of enlightened opinion.\" She points to the passage in chapter 33 where Melville describes the German immigrants preparing for their voyage to America:\nInterpretations of \"Redburn\" generally fall into two schools. The first, usually called the biographical school, may be found in studies of Melville written in the 1920s by critics such as Raymond Weaver, John Freeman, and Lewis Mumford. Typifying this school's approach is Mumford's statement that:\nBy the 1950s, a second school arose which might be called the \"mythic\" school. Newton Arvin wrote:\n\nThis new approach represented a broad trend that sought to reinterpret American literature—Irving, Cooper, Hawthorne, Twain, James, Faulkner, and Hemingway—in the light of mythic quests and patterns. In one view, \"Redburn\" is \"a stronger indictment of an American embarking upon a voyage of international experience than Henry James would produce and a more ironic and embittered portrait of the young protagonist's incapacity for art than James Joyce would produce.\"\n\nCritics have clarified or called attention to particular points. After some debate in the 1980s when the notion was first proposed, critics seem to agree that Aladdin's Palace is a \"male brothel\", including Elizabeth Hardwick who describes it as \"a strange, fastidiously observed, rococo urban landscape unlike any other dramatic intrusion in Melville's writings or in American literature at the time.\" Following Hardwick, critic Evan Lang Pandya argued that Aladdin's Palace draws on \"fantasies of the blank Arabian signifier, the obscure desert of ambiguities, including sexual ambiguity.\"\n\nIn addition to the social criticism of the Launcelott's Hey incident (Ch. 37), Melville attacks the evils of alcohol and the exploitation of emigrants by shipping services. The chapter \"A Living Corpse\", like Charles Dickens' \"Bleak House\", contains an example of spontaneous human combustion in literature (Ch. 48).\n\n\n\n"}

It serves as a commuter city within the Jakarta metropolitan area, although it has notable trade, business and processing industries. According to the 2018 estimation by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Bekasi (2.93 million) has already overtaken Surabaya (2,89 million) as the second most populous city proper in Indonesia. The city is bordered by Bekasi Regency to the north and the east, Bogor Regency and Depok to the south, and East Jakarta to the west. It is Indonesia's most populous satellite city, and one of the most populous worldwide, but still trails the likes of Incheon and Yokohama.\n\nBekasi is one of the oldest cities in Indonesia, and has a history of being the capital city of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara. At that time, the name of Bekasi was Dayeuh Sundasembawa. The earliest evidence of its existence dates from the 5th century according to the Tugu inscription. During the Dutch East Indies period, Bekasi was a part of Batavia residency. As a dormitory city, many middle-up satellite areas have been developed in Bekasi, complete with their own shopping malls, schools, hospitals, club houses, water park, and shuttle bus services to central Jakarta. The large number of multinational companies, has apparently attracted many expatriates (mainly Japanese and Korean) to settle in Bekasi.\n\nBekasi has already grown to become one of the centre of growth in Indonesia. The city has accounts for 2.11% of total national GDP. Recently, many foreigners (most of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese) have set up their business to take advantage of its dynamism and boost its economy. Bekasi's economy was mainly based on service and manufacturing. \n\nBekasi is one of the most promising property markets in Indonesia, and several high-value developments have transformed its property market. Many of country's big property developers are building apartments, hotels, and shopping malls in the city. In recent years, some residences have developed along the Jatiwarna/Jatibening — East Bekasi toll highway, further to Cibatu in Bekasi Regency. These include Harapan Indah, Summarecon Bekasi, Kemang Pratama and Grand Galaxy City. \n\nPrime business and commercial centres in the western part of city. There are some of financial, restaurants and shopping centres along Jalan Ahmad Yani, Jalan Sudirman, Jalan KH. Noer Alie as well as Harapan Indah Boulevard. Bekasi has the upper-middle class shopping malls which are consist of high-street brands such as Uniqlo, Marks & Spencer, H&M and Cotton On. The largest shopping centre is Grand Metropolitan with over 125,000 m² of floor space. Other shopping centres include Metropolitan Mall, Summarecon Mal Bekasi, Mal Ciputra Cibubur, Mega Bekasi Hypermall, Grand Galaxy Park, Grand Mall, Blu Plaza, BTC Mall, GP Mall, Bekasi Cyber Park, Plaza Pondok Gede, and Lagoon Avenue. Many hotels developed in Bekasi, such as Santika, Horison, Harris, Aston Imperial, Amaris, Amaroossa and Tune Hotel.\n\nIn addition to its numerous residential areas, there are several important industrial areas in the outskirts of Bekasi. Most of them are in Bekasi Regency, rather than the city limits. These include the Jababeka, MM 2100, Bekasi International Industrial Estate (BIIE), Delta Silicon Industrial Park, Lippo Cikarang, Greenland International Industrial City (GIIC) and East Jakarta Industrial Park (EJIP) districts. Many large companies, such as Honda, LG, Converse and Samsung, have factories in Bekasi. Nowadays some 4,000 companies are operating in Bekasi and surrounding areas. It is estimated that approximately 1,000 expatriate workers and over 500,000 labourers are working in the area.\n\nHankook Tire of South Korea is building a US$353 million tire plant in Bekasi and started production in 2014.\n\nThe development of large scale residential areas and industrial parks in Bekasi has been induced by infrastructure development, especially roads, highways and railways.\n\nBekasi is connected by the Trans-Java Highway, the main road across Java. There are three highways connections from the Jabodetabek urban area. The Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road, which has three exits in Bekasi; the Jakarta Outer Ring Road, which provides access to Tangerang, Jakarta and Bogor as well as the new Bekasi-Cawang-Kampung Melayu Toll Road. In 2019, Jakarta-Cikampek elevated toll road will operate to ease traffic in current toll road between Cikunir to West Karawang with a total length of 36.4 kilometres. Owing to its location as a satellite city of Jakarta, heavy rush hour traffic jams have become common on the roads between East Jakarta and Bekasi. \n\nThe government is currently constructing a double track railway connecting Manggarai to Cikarang, which would be finished around 2020. Beside a double track railway, the government also building a 17.9 km light rail transit line connecting East Bekasi-Cawang-Dukuh Atas across Greater Jakarta.\n\nAt present, rapid transit in Bekasi across Greater Jakarta consists of a BRT TransJakarta and a commuter rail KRL Jabodetabek. KRL Jabodetabek serves from Bekasi to Jakarta Kota via Pasar Senen/Manggarai vice versa. Another train service is airport train service connecting the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to Bekasi.\n\nTransJakarta and the Transjabodetabek premium serves commuters from Harapan Indah, Summarecon Bekasi, Bulak Kapal, and Jatiwarna, as well as the feeder buses from Kemang Pratama and Grand Galaxy City to Jakarta city centre. The Trans Patriot operates a route within the city. Damri shuttle bus service is available from the Soekarno–Hatta International Airport to Kayuringin, Harapan Indah and Summarecon Bekasi. Taxis are widely available. The primary means of public transportation is by minibus, called \"angkot\". They serve certain routes throughout the city.\n\nThe main bus terminal is Terminal Bekasi, located in East Bekasi. The other terminals are Pondok Gede, Harapan Indah and Kayuringin.\n\nThe latest official statistic (2018) of Bekasi's population was 2,931,897, giving a density of . Bekasi is inhabited by many different ethnic groups, mostly Betawi and Javanese descent. Sundanese are the largest minority as well as other minorities include Minangkabau, Bataks, and Chinese.\n\nMost citizens in Bekasi adhere to Islam. Other religions include Christianity (Roman Catholicism and Protestantism), Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.\n\nBekasi was the home base of the soccer team Bhayangkara F.C., with Patriot Chandrabhaga Stadium as the home stadium of the club.\n\nBekasi City is divided into 12 districts ('kecamatan'):\n\n\nKalimalang (Greater Bekasi Media)\n\nNotable people from Bekasi include:\n\n"}

In the album's three parts, \"Dogs\", \"Pigs\" and \"Sheep\", pigs represent the people whom Roger Waters considers to be at the top of the social ladder, the ones with wealth and power; they also manipulate the rest of society and encourage them to be viciously competitive and cut-throat, so the pigs can remain powerful.\n\nThe song's three verses each presents a different \"pig\", the identities of which remain a subject of speculation because only the third verse clearly identifies its subject as being morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who is described as a \"house proud town mouse\" who has to \"keep it all on the inside.\" In 1992, on the Westwood One radio special \"Pink Floyd : The 25th Anniversary Special\", Roger Waters told Jim Ladd that the \"Whitehouse\" mentioned had nothing to do with the home of the U.S. President, the White House, after Ladd told Waters he interpreted the last verse as an attack on Gerald Ford, who was US president at the time the song was recorded.\n\nHalfway through the song, David Gilmour uses a Heil talk box on the guitar solo to mimic the sound of pigs. This is the first use of a talk box by Pink Floyd. Gilmour also plays a fretless bass guitar, with a pick, doing two short, syncopated bass solos—one before the first verse, another before the third. When the final verse ends and a guitar solo emerges, the bass line moves into a driving eighth note rhythm, sliding up and down the E minor scale in octaves, beneath the chords of E minor and C major seventh. Roger Waters, usually the band's bassist, played a rhythm guitar track on the song instead.\n\nAlthough it was not made available for commercial purchase, promotional copies were released in Brazil, albeit in an edited form of only four minutes and five seconds in length. In some cassette tape versions of the album, this song was divided into two parts after the first verse, fading out on side one and fading back in on side two, in order to minimize the total length of tape.\n\nThe normal length of the song performed live was roughly 17 minutes (some would top out at 20 minutes), compared with the album length of 11 minutes and 28 seconds. Live renditions basically followed the album version with a few notable differences: an extra guitar solo was played after the second verse, the talk-box solo on guitar was substituted with a Minimoog solo and to the coda were added a quiet Hammond-led section and a crescendo reprise of the guitar solo with aggressive drumming. Waters, who sang on both the studio and live versions of \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\", also added his signature screams throughout live performances of this song during the 1977 tour.\n\nWhile playing on the 1977 tour, Waters shouted a different number for each concert. This purportedly had the purpose of identifying bootleg recordings. Also, Snowy White would play bass guitar while Roger played rhythm electric guitar with his black with white pickguard Fender Stratocaster.\n\nWhen this song was performed in Montreal on 6 July 1977, a disruptive fan angered Waters by throwing a beer bottle onto the stage. While the band played toward the climax of the song's jam section, Waters called the fan onto the stage through the microphone, then spat in his face after pretending to help him up. This concert, of which bootleg recordings exist, has been cited as a catalyst for Pink Floyd's next album, \"The Wall\".\n\nIn 1987, on tour to promote his solo album \"Radio K.A.O.S.\", Waters performed a shortened version of the song, featuring only the first two verses and shorter guitar solos between them as part of an extended Pink Floyd medley.\n\nThe song remained in Waters' setlist for his 2017 Us + Them Tour, once again being played in its entirety and with the anti-Trump images (\"Fuck Trump\" was changed to \"Trump Is a Pig\" on later dates). Waters plays Gilmour's original bass parts rather than rhythm guitar. While the response to the anti-Trump images has been mostly positive, some fans at his shows have booed or even walked out during the song over their anger at the anti-Trump images and political message. Waters responded to the anti-Trump critics saying \"I find it slightly surprising that anybody could have been listening to my songs for 50 years without understanding\" and said to those critics if they didn't like what he was doing \"go see Katy Perry or watch the Kardashians. I don't care.\" Waters also said that, due to his anti-Trump images, he lost sponsors such as American Express who refused to have their company associated with his shows.\n\n\nRecording dates: April and May 1976 at the band's own Britannia Row Studios, Islington, London.\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

Held annually in Cannes, France, it was instituted in 1932 and often regarded as the unofficial time trial championship of the world and as a Classic cycle race. The race was the idea of a Parisian newspaper editor called Gaston Bénac. The beret-wearing sports editor was looking for a race to make a name for \"Paris-Soir\", the biggest French evening paper before the war.\n\nHe and his colleague Albert Baker d'Isy had been inspired by the world road race championship in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1931. That, unusually, had been run as a time trial, and the two were impressed and also, they said, aware that a time-trial cost less to organise than a conventional road race. Baker d'Isy decided the name Grand Prix des Nations.\n\nThere is a dispute over who devised the first route. The American-French writer René de Latour said in the UK magazine Sporting Cyclist that he did; Baker d'Isy says that he did. The route started near the Versailles château and ran round a triangle through Rambouillet, Maulette, Saint-Rémy-les-Chevreuse, Versailles and Boulogne to finish on the Vélodrome Buffalo where the founder of the Tour de France, Henri Desgrange, had become the world's first hour record holder in 1893. There were three hills, one in the first 100 km, plenty of cobbles, and the last 40 km went through the woods of the Vallée de Chevreuse, a popular area for bike riders. The distance was 142 km.\n\nThe introduction of an official time trial champion at the UCI Road World Championships in 1994 and an Olympic individual time trial championship (1996) reduced its importance. With the introduction of the UCI ProTour in 2005, the event was removed from the calendar.\n\nRace distances have varied. Until 1955, it was approximately 140 km; six years later, the distance was 100 km; from 1965 onwards the distance rarely exceeded 90 km, with many events run of around 75 km. The events were in the Vallée de Chevreuse in the Paris area, then near Cannes on the French Riviera; for five years from 1993, it was held at the Madine Lake in the Meuse; from 1998, it has taken place in Seine-Maritime département, two circuits of 35 km around Dieppe.\n\nThe roll of honour includes cycling's greatest time trialists, but the event's history was dominated by two Frenchmen: Jacques Anquetil won nine times, Bernard Hinault five.\n\nBritish amateur woman Beryl Burton competed in 1968, finishing only minutes behind her male rivals.\n"}

The park opened in 1973 and is owned and operated by Cedar Fair, which purchased the park from Hunt-Midwest in 1995. Admission to Worlds of Fun includes access to Oceans of Fun, a water park adjacent to the amusement park.\n\nWorlds of Fun opened on May 2, 1973, at a cost of $10 million. It is situated at the northern edge of a vast industrial complex in the bluffs above the Missouri River in Clay County, Missouri. At the time of its opening, numerous modernization projects across Kansas City were in progress including the opening of Kansas City International Airport, Kemper Arena (now called Hy-Vee Arena) and the Truman Sports Complex. Mid-America Enterprises, seeking to capitalize on the citywide expansion movement, began construction on a new amusement park in 1969. The park was originally planned to complement a hotel and entertainment complex, but a lagging economy during the park's early years derailed the idea.\n\nIn 1974, the first addition to Worlds of Fun was the 4000-seat Forum Amphitheater opened in the Europa section of the park. In 1976, a new section opened in honor of the United States Bicentennial – the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence – and was named Bicentennial Square. The new section included the debut of Screamroller from Arrow Dynamics, which was a replica of the first modern-looping roller coaster, Corkscrew, that opened a year earlier at Knott's Berry Farm.\n\nIn 1982, Oceans of Fun opened next door as the largest water park in the world. Also the same year, a sub-world \"River City\" was opened in Americana bordering the Orient section. Screamroller was transformed into Extremeroller the following year, which featured stand-up trains instead of the original sit-down models making it the first looping, stand-up roller coaster in North America. Several years later in 1989, Worlds of Fun ended the decade with the addition of Timber Wolf, a wooden roller coaster that initially ranked high in several national polls.\n\nCedar Fair LP purchased Worlds of Fun in 1995. The new owners invested $10 million with the addition of Mamba, a D.H. Morgan Manufacturing steel hypercoaster, to the park's attraction lineup in 1998.\n\n\nThe park takes its theme from the Jules Verne book, \"Around the World in Eighty Days\". Worlds of Fun is divided into five major sections (Scandinavia, Africa, Europa, the Orient, and Americana). Rides, attractions, shops, shows, and restaurants are named according to the area theme. Guests enter the park in Scandinavia. In 1997 the Americana \"main entrance\" was closed for the creation of Grand Prix, so the \"back gate\" became the \"main gate\" ever since. The next world to the left is Africa, continuing in a clockwise rotation, guest would then enter the Americana section, followed by the Orient. The Europa section is located in the approximate center of the circle.\n\nWithin Americana, lies the sub-section of Planet Snoopy (the area of the park specifically for young children). Originally added in 1978 as an expansion of Americana, over the years the grounds have changed its identity several times. Initially it was called \"Aerodrome\" (1978–86) with futuristic rides for adults, it then became a children's area called \"Pandamonium!\" (1987–97), then \"Berenstain Bear Country\" (1997–2000), and \"Camp Snoopy\" (2001–2010), and is currently \"Planet Snoopy\", new to the 2011 season. Past sub-sections have also included Bicentennial Square, River City, and Beat Street, which all have been absorbed back into Americana.\n\nDespite the lack of an Australian/Oceanic section, the Australian-themed Boomerang roller coaster is incorporated into Africa.\n\n\n\n\nOceans of Fun is Worlds of Fun's water park. It opened in 1982 as the world's largest water park. It is included with admission to Worlds of Fun, beginning in the 2013 season.\n\nFast Lane is Worlds of Fun's \"two line\" system introduced 2012. For a cost between $30 and $50 (in addition to normal admission charges), visitors receive a wrist band that enables them to bypass the standby line and enter the \"Fast Lane\" line to significantly reduce their wait time.\n\nDuring Halloween Haunt, a similar system named \"Fright Lane\" is sold. Serving the same purpose as Fast Lane, it significantly reduces wait time of select haunted attractions. \"Fright Lane+\" includes a \"Skeleton Key\", a key that grants you special access to secret, intense rooms in six of the eight haunted houses. In addition, holders receive special seating for Ed Alonzo's Psycho Circus of Magic and Mayhem. \"Fright Lane Max\" is a VIP system that allows you special seating at Overlord's Awakening, a meal, limited edition Haunt T-shirts, plus all perks listed above.\n\nIn 2005 Worlds of Fun opened the first on-site resort. The campground is adjacent to the park, and is located \"behind\" Mamba. The Village has 22 cabins and 20 cottages and 82 sites for RVs, complete with electric and TV cable hook ups. Each cabin or cottage can fit 6–8 people.\n\n\"Snoopy's Hot Summer Lights\", which debuted in 2010, was an immersive light and sound experience starring the Peanuts characters. Snoopy's Hot Summer Lights features over 2 million LED lights and a variety of audio soundtracks through the Africa and Europa sections of the park. Along the walkway there were replicas of Snoopy and other characters for guests to view. Snoopy's Hot Summer Lights was a one million dollar investment that used special effects and sound design, custom designed for Worlds of Fun by Emmy Award-Winning RWS and Associates. Snoopy's Hot Summer Lights opened for its original run on June 4 and ran through September 5, 2010.\n\nHalloween Haunt is a Halloween event that takes place during the Halloween season. It is included in the price of admission.\n\n, it features 12 Extreme Haunts, including eight mazes and three scare zones, along with three live shows.\n\nCole Lindbergh, former manager of the park's games department, was featured in a 2011 episode of Public Radio International's \"This American Life\", \"Amusement Park.\" In the nine-minute prologue, host Ira Glass interviews Lindbergh about his management philosophy and plays segments from several YouTube videos he made to promote the park's games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

That first year the firm employed eighteen and built 50 automobile bodies.\n\nOn 22 May 1930 papers were filed to become a corporation, \"Società anonima Carrozzeria Pinin Farina\" headquartered in Turin, Italy, at 107 Corso Trapani.\nDuring the 1930s, the company built bodies for Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Isotta Fraschini, Hispano-Suiza, Fiat, Cadillac, and Rolls-Royce. With its close relationship with Lancia, the pioneer of the monocoque in automobile design, Farina became the first coachbuilder to build bodies for the new technique also known as unibody construction. This development happened in the mid-1930s when others saw the frameless construction as the end of the independent coachbuilder.\n\nIn 1939, World War II ended automobile production, but the company had 400 employees building 150 bodies a month. The war effort against the Allies brought work making ambulances and searchlight carriages. The Pinin Farina factory was destroyed by Allied bombers ending the firm's operations.\n\nAfter the war, Italy was banned from the 1946 Paris Motor Show. The Paris show was attended by 809,000 visitors (twice the pre-war figure), queues stretched from the main gate all the way to the Seine. Pinin Farina and his son Sergio, determined to defy the ban, drove two of their cars (an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 S and a Lancia Aprilia cabriolet) from Turin to Paris, and found a place at the entrance to the exhibition to display the two new creations. The managers of the Grand Palais said of the display, \"the devil Pinin Farina\", but to the press and the public it was the successful \"Turin coachbuilder's anti-salon\".\n\nAt the end of 1945 the Cisitalia 202 Coupé was designed. An elegantly proportioned design with a low hood, it is the car that usually is given credit for establishing Pinin Farina's reputation. The Pinin Farina design was honored in the Museum of Modern Art's landmark presentation \"Eight Automobiles\" in 1951. A total of 170 Coupés were produced by Pinin Farina.\n\nThe publicity of the Museum of Modern Art exhibit brought Pinin Farina to the attention of Nash-Kelvinator managers. The subsequent cooperation with Nash Motors resulted in high-volume production of Pinin Farina designs and provided a major entry into the United States market. In 1952, Farina visited the U.S. for the unveiling of his design for the Nash Ambassador and Statesman lines, which, although they did carry some details of Pinin Farina's design, were largely designed by Nash's then-new in-house styling staff when the original Farina-designed model proved unsuited to American tastes, exhibiting a popular 1950s appearance called \"ponton\". The Nash-Healey sports car body was, however, completely designed and assembled in limited numbers from 1952 to 1954 at Pinin Farina's Turin facilities. Nash heavily advertised its link to the famous Italian designer, much as Studebaker promoted its longtime association with Raymond Loewy. As a result of Nash's million advertising campaign, Pinin Farina became well known in the U.S.\n\nPinin Farina also built the bodies for the limited-series Cadillac Eldorado Brougham for General Motors in 1959 and 1960, assembled them and sent them back to the U.S. There were 99 Broughams built in 1959 and 101 in 1960. A similar arrangement was repeated in the late 1980s when Pininfarina designed (and partially assembled) the Cadillac Allanté at the San Giusto Canavese factory. The car bodies were assembled and painted in Italy before being flown from the Turin International Airport to Detroit for final vehicle assembly.\n\nIt started in 1951 with a meeting at a restaurant in Tortona, a small town halfway between Turin and Modena. This neutral territory was chosen because neither Farina nor Enzo Ferrari wanted to meet at the other's headquarters. Battista’s son, Sergio Pininfarina recalled, \"It is not difficult to imagine how I felt that afternoon when my father, without taking his eyes off the road for one moment told me his decision as we drove back to Turin: \"From now on you'll be looking after Ferrari, from A to Z. Design, engineering, technology, construction—the lot!\"—I was over the moon with happiness.\" \"\n\nSince that meeting the only road-going production Ferraris not designed by Pininfarina are the 1973 Dino 308 GT4 and 2013's LaFerrari. Their relationship was so close that Pininfarina became a partner of Ferrari in \"Scuderia Ferrari SpA SEFAC\", the organization that ran Ferrari's race team from 1961–1989, Pinin was a vice president of Ferrari, and Sergio later sat on Ferrari's board of directors.\n\nFerrari does not sell new cars by Pininfarina in 2018. The last penned by Pininfarina was the Ferrari F12berlinetta which was produced 2012–17.\n\nIn 1954 to 1955 Pinin Farina purchased land in Grugliasco, outside of Turin, for a new factory. \"The factory in no way would look like the one of Corso Trapani. It would be a car no longer on my measurements but on those of my children, built looking like them; I had this in mind and wanted it,\" said Farina.\n\nAround the same time, Alfa Romeo accepted Pininfarina's design over Bertone for the new Giulietta Spider. The Alfa was the first vehicle that Pinin Farina produced in large numbers, in fact Alfa Romeo chose Pinin Farina to produce the Spider in large part because they felt confident that they could produce 20 cars a day for a run of 1,000 bodies. The Spider was a huge success for Alfa Romeo and Pinin Farina. Max Hoffman the importer for the United States said he could sell as many as they could make. In 1958, the first year of production, they produced 1025 units which then expanded to over 4,000 in 1959 the first full year of the new Grugliasco factory.\n\nStarting with the planning for the new plant in Grugliasco in 1956, Farina started to groom his replacements–Sergio his son and Renzo Carli his son-in-law. To his heirs apparent, Farina said of the Corso Trapani facility \"This old plant has reached the limits of its growth. It has no room for expansion and is far from being up to date. If I were alone I'd leave it as it is. But I want you to decide which way to go–to stay as we are or to enlarge. Either way is fine with me. It's your decision to make and I don't want to know what it is. I'm finished and it's your time to take over. The future is absolutely up to you.\" In 1958, upon leaving for a world tour Farina added \"In my family we inherit our legacies from live people–not from the dead.\"\n\nIn 1961 at the age of 68, “Pinin” Farina formally turned his firm over to his son Sergio and his son-in-law, Renzo\nCarli, it was the same year that the President of Italy formally authorized the change of Farina’s last name to Pininfarina and the business took on the same name.\n\nPininfarina was run by Battista's grandson Andrea Pininfarina from 2001 until his death in 2008. Andrea's younger brother Paolo Pininfarina was then appointed as successor.\n\nStarting in the mid-1960s, Pininfarina started to make investments in the science of automotive design, a strategy to differentiate itself from the other Italian coachbuilders.\n\nIn 1966, Pininfarina opened the Studies and Research Centre (\"Studi e Ricerche\") in Grugliasco. The research centre occupied 8,000 sq. metres (2 acres) and employed 180 technicians capable of producing 25 prototypes a year.\n\nThe Calculation and Design Centre was set up in 1967, the first step in a process of technological evolution which, during the 1970s, would take Pininfarina into the lead in automated bodywork design.\n\nThen in 1972 construction of a full-sized wind tunnel was completed. The project was started in 1966. When it opened, it not only was the first wind tunnel with the ability to test full-sized cars in Italy, but also one of the first in the world with this ability. To put this foresight in perspective, GM's full-sized wind tunnel didn't open until 1980.\n\nThe 1980s started a period of expansion for Pininfarina.\n\nIn 1982, the company opened “Pininfarina Studi e Ricerche\" in Cambiano. It was separate from the factory and wind tunnel in Grugliasco, to keep design and research activities independent from manufacturing. On 14 October 2002, Pininfarina inaugurated a new engineering centre. The new facility, which was built at the Cambiano campus, to give greater visibility and independence to the engineering operations.\n\nIn 1983, Pininfarina reached an agreement with General Motors to design and build the Cadillac Allanté. The Allanté project led to the building of the San Giorgio factory in 1985.\n\nIn 1996, Mitsubishi entered into talks for Pininfarina build their new compact SUV, the Pajero, in Italy. While Mitsubishi recognized Pininfarina's expertise in design and engineering, the reason for choosing them was that manufacturing costs were half of those in Germany. After entering into an agreement in 1996, Pininfarina purchased an industrial site at Bairo Canavese near Turin, Italy. in April 1997, Bairo Canavese was dedicated to the production of the new Mitsubishi Pajero Pinin.\nPininfarina Sverige AB in Uddevalla, Sweden, was established in 2003 as a joint venture (JV) between Volvo Cars and Pininfarina to produce a new Volvo convertible that will be sold in Europe and the United States. The JV is owned 60% by Pininfarina and 40% by Volvo. The C70 model designed by Volvo's John Kinsey—was launched on 13 April 2006, sharing the Volvo P1 platform used in the S40.\n\nIn April 2008, after three years of serious losses totaling 115 million euros at the end of 2007, Pininfarina made the first of several moves to raise capital and restructure its enormous debt:\n\nPininfarina announced Piero Ferrari, Alberto Bombassei (chairman of Brembo), and the Marsiaj family (founders of the Sabelt seatbelt company), will join with Vincent Bolloré, a French financier, and Ratan Tata, head of India's Tata Group conglomerate, who already announced their plans to invest. The five would together invest million. Funding would come through the sale of stock to other investors. The Pininfarina family was willing to reduce its share from 55% to 30%, which would still be enough to secure a controlling interest.\n\nOn 31 December 2008, Pininfarina announced a debt restructuring that would require the family to sell its stake in the company. The agreement was made after Pininfarina's value dropped 67 per cent during 2008, and it then had a market capitalization of about €36 million. It had total debts of €598 million at the end of November. Of that amount, €555 million was the subject of the debt restructuring agreement that was agreed on with a consortium of banks.\n\nPincar, Pininfarina's family holding company, announced it has hired investment bank Leonardo & Co. to find a buyer for its 50.6% stake in Pininfarina per the debt restructuring agreement reached in December.\n\nPininfarina released a statement saying that it is still gathering \"possible offers from potential buyers,\" adding it would release more information when it was appropriate.\n\nCompany sources added, the family will not sell its entire 50.7% stake but that Pincar would no longer be a majority shareholder.\n\nAn agreement with creditor banks including Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Mediobanca and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena to restructure net debt of 76 million euros is on track and will be reached in the coming months, said three sources close to the situation. \"The debt situation is stable and the talks are not contentious, so there is no hurry,\" said one of the sources, speaking on condition anonymity. \"The agreement will fix the capital structure for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nWhen finalised, the debt accord will give control of the family's 77 % stake to its creditor banks, ending the Pininfarina family's ownership.\n\nThe deal will close a chapter that began in 2008 when the banks swapped 180 million euros in debt in exchange for a promise of proceeds from a future sale of part of the Pininfarina's family stake.\n\nBut no takers materialised. Potential buyers were not willing to acquire a design company when they can easily contract its services, said one of the people familiar with the situation.\n\nIn a statement released on 15 February, the Cambiano-based company, which owes over million to a number of Italian banks, said its debt repayment date has been extended to 2018, from 2015.\n\nThe agreement, which will be signed in the next few weeks, will also see the company take advantage of interest rates “significantly lower than [current] market rates”. With the new debt restructuring deal with its creditors Pininfarina will remain under the control of the Pininfarina family.\n\nAutomotive News reported Pininfarina projects will be profitable in 2012, thanks in part to debt restructuring. The Italian design studio hasn't be in profit in eight years, but signed a deal in April to restructure million in debt. The move effectively stretched the studio's repayment deadline from 2015 to 2018. At the same time, Pininfarina announced it will likely see an operating loss this year, but a one-time gain of million will result in the net profit. The preceding year, the company lost million in the first quarter, though that figure has dropped to just under million during Q1 2012.\n\nPininfarina also saw its net revenue increase by million.\n\nPininfarina in the black for first time since 2004 Italian design house Pininfarina predicted last May that it would face an operating loss for 2012 but still come out with a net profit. Both predictions came true: the company is reporting an operating loss of 8.2 million euros and a net profit of 32.9 million euros.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the good news came because of a debt restructuring arranged the preceding year that gave the company three more years to repay its million in debt, and a one-time gain of approximately 45 million euros. It is the company's first profit since 2004.\n\nMahindra Group, owner of Indian automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra agreed to buy Italian car designer Pininfarina SpA in a deal worth about 168 million euros.\n\nMahindra group, together with affiliate Tech Mahindra, have 76 % stake from holding company Pincar for 25.3 million euros. The Indian company will offer the same price for the remaining stock. In addition to buying stock, Mahindra will invest 20 million euros in Pininfarina and provide a guarantee to creditors of 114.5 million euros.\n\n\nOn December 10, 2011 Pininfarina announced it would end all automotive production. In truth production ended in November 2010 with the conclusion of the contract to produce the Alfa Romeo Brera and Spider at the San Giorgio plant.\n\nOpened in 1958 with nearly 1,000 employees, by 1960 output exceeded 11,000 car bodies. In 2009 Pininfarina sold the factory to Finpiemonte, the public finance of the Piedmont Region, at the price of 14.4 million euro. Finpiemonte, as part of the deal, leases the plant to Gian Mario Rossignolo at a rent of per year for six years renewable.\n\nThe Grugliasco sale did not include an adjacent structure that houses the wind tunnel.\n\nOpened in 1986 to build Cadillac Allante bodies for General Motors, the same year Pininfarina was first listed on the Stock Exchange in Milan. Automotive production ended at San Giorgio with the conclusion of the Ford production in July 2010, and Alfa Romeo production in November 2010.\n\nFollowing the end of contract manufacturing activities San Giorgio Canavese is being used for production of spare parts for cars manufactured in the past.\n\nPininfarina opened its third manufacturing plant in 1997. Currently Pininfarina leases the plant and 57 employees to the Cecomp Group. This agreement to produce 4,000 electric Bolloré Bluecars runs from 1 April 2011 to 31 December 2013. On 13 September 2013 a new lease agreement was announced, this new agreement will run from 1 January 2014 until the end of 2016.\n\nA joint venture between Pininfarina S.p.A. and Volvo Car Corporation began in 2003. Volvo and Pininfarina S.p.A. have agreed upon the termination of the joint venture agreement regarding Pininfarina Sverige AB and its operations in Uddevalla, Sweden. As of 31 December 2011 the termination this agreement would result in a 30 million euros fee paid to Pininfarina.\n\nOn 25 June 2013 the last Volvo C70 was produced and the Uddevalla assembly plant was closed.\n\nAlthough Pininfarina rarely gave credit to individuals, that policy seems to have changed in recent years and many of the designers of the past have become known. As of 2016 Pininfarina employs 98 people in their design department, down from 185 in 2005.\n\nPininfarina designs, manufactures, assembles, and tests prototypes and production vehicles under contract for other automakers.\n\nAs of 10 December 2011 Pininfarina announced it would end all mass automotive production with the sale of its 40% stake in the Uddevalla, Sweden plant to Volvo in 2013. In the past Pininfarina has produced both cars and car-bodies under contract from other automakers. This production includes Pininfarina-designed cars and vehicles designed by others.\n\nA sortable list of complete cars or car bodies manufactured in one of the five Pininfarina factories:\nBefore the war Pininfarina built car bodies mostly for individual customers, many of the bodies were \"one offs\" and not mass-produced.\nIn addition to production vehicles, Pininfarina creates prototype, show, and custom cars for auto manufacturers, as well as private clients. Most prototypes—such as the Ferrari Mythos, were concept cars, although several have become production models, including the Ferrari 612 Scaglietti and Ferrari F50.\n\nA recent privately commissioned custom example was the Ferrari P4/5 of 2006, a one-car rebody (changing the exterior design) of the Enzo Ferrari according to the client's specifications. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car though the engine, drivetrain and many other components are simply modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo it was derived from. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on 18 August 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September. Another recent prototype is the Pininfarina Nido, a two-seater sub-compact that could possibly make airbags obsolete.\n\nThe Pininfarina B0 solar-electric concept, designed with Bolloré was shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show featuring a range between charges of more than with an electronically limited top speed, and an estimated acceleration to in 6.3 seconds. The car has solar panels on the roof and on the nose, while its battery pack is said to last up to .\n\nOn 15 May 2013 Pininfarina announced the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupé to be revealed on 24 May at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Pininfarina announced this one-off concept car as the first collaboration between BMW and Pininfarina, but in 1949 BMW commissioned Pininfarina design and build a prototype of the BMW 501—it was rejected for being too modern.\nA list of Post WWII cars designed by Pininfarina that went into production.\n\nPininfarina has an area dedicated to the new electric car Pininfarina Bolloré. Batteries are produced by the French Bolloré Group.\n\nPininfarina, has introduced its own electric vehicle concept, the Pininfarina B0 (pronounced \"B Zero\"). The four-seat hatchback features a solid-state lithium-polymer battery, supercapacitors, and a roof- integrated solar panel to achieve a range of . Developed in partnership with the Bolloré Group, the vehicle was slated for limited production in 2009 as the Bolloré Bluecar.\n\nPininfarina displayed a turbine-powered plug-in hybrid called the Cambiano at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.\n\nAt the 2016 Geneva Motor Show Pininfarina revealed the H2 Speed, an electric sports car concept. The H2 Speed is a hydrogen vehicle with two race-specification electric motors which are fed by a hydrogen fuel cell. The hydrogen power unit was designed by Swiss company GreenGT.\n\nOn 27 November 2018, it was announced that Automobili Pininfarina had invested over €20m in Pininfarina design services to support plans for its range of luxury electric cars. This includes design and engineering services for the first Pininfarina-branded performance car which is a luxury electric sports car called the Battista (named after company founder Battista 'Pinin' Farina and originally codenamed PF0). With four electric motors, the car is supposed to be able to reach 100 km/h (62 mph) from a standstill in under two seconds with a top speed of . Automobili Pininfarina plans to reveal the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. Further details on the Battista surfaced on March 4, 2019. It has 1900 horsepower, and only 150 will be built. It is also related to the Rimac C Two.\n\n\n\nPininfarina also works with other companies such as SimpleTech for product design.\n\nOther Pininfarina product designs include the 2006 Winter Olympics torch, cauldron and medals, as well as major appliance collections for Gorenje.\n\nOn December 1999, Pininfarina cooperated with Casio and designed a watch under its label, the G-Shock GE-2000. However, the watch received negative critics from the fans due to its weak strap, which was vulnerable to breaks during normal use.\nPininfarina was a design contractor for the development of the Coca-Cola Freestyle drinks dispenser.\n\nPininfarina Extra, founded in 1986, is the Pininfarina Group design company which does not work in the transport sector.

{"id": "1915133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915133", "title": "Room service", "text": "Room service\n\nRoom service or in-room dining is a hotel service enabling guests to choose items of food and drink for delivery to their hotel room for consumption. Room service is organised as a subdivision within the food and beverage department of high-end hotel and resort properties. It is uncommon for room service to be offered in hotels that are not high-end, or in motels. Room service may also be provided for guests on cruise ships. Room service may be provided on a 24-hour basis or limited to late night hours only. Due to the cost of customized orders and delivery of room service, prices charged to the patron are typically much higher than in the hotel's restaurant or tuck shop, and a gratuity is expected.\n\nRoom service has dated back many centuries in various early forms of rooms service depending on the hotel, early forms had the customer personally go to the receptionists to be provided such services. It was rare for hotels to provide room services, as this was usually a service only high-class hotels have. The Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York which was already a symbol of fame and distinction after its construction during the late 19th century., specifically the new Waldorf which opened in 1931 in another location, this new Waldorf was the first to introduced room service as well as introducing other advancements into the industry such as reservations at the restaurant and full electrical wiring. Nowadays room service is now considered a necessity for any hotel and even to have this type of service become a worldwide occurrence.\n\nTo address clinical issues and reduce mortality rates related to nutritional issues, the Mater Private Hospital Brisbane in Australia, became the first to offer room service in a hospital setting in 2013, providing more appropriate nutrition at an affordable price point. Though as technology advances, hotel customer services continue to evolve, allowing hotels to provide all customers room service and even including more options.\n\nOrganizations tend to have their own standards for room service, as there are no universally held best practices as they differ from business to business and the best practice depends on the guest's perspective, but generally it can be considered the guest's ability to order a meal, the meal being prepared and be served the product in the privacy of their own room as to maximize the customers comfort.\n\nA variety of hotel staff categories work on room service.\nThe role of hotel management in regards to room service is to ensure guest satisfaction and to address any complaints and queries that may arise. Their responsibilities also include recruiting, training and supervising staff, they also manage the budget to maintain financial records, planning maintenance, events and the bookings for rooms, promotions and marketing.\n\nIn addition to making guests feel welcome and providing an enjoyable dining experience, restaurant managers are responsible for processing room service orders accurately and efficiently and ensuring compliance of the relevant health and safety regulations. The restaurant manager is responsible for recruiting, training, supervising staff, managing budgets, menu planning, greeting customer and handling the customers complaints and inquires.\n\nWaiters and waitresses (also known as \"servers\") are responsible for setting up the hotel restaurant, delivering food to rooms, and making sure that guests have everything they need. Waiters and waitress often have to have patience, personality and persistence as their responsibility can often includes greet and escort customers, presenting, understanding and specials the information on the menu, preparation of tables, utensils and glasses and communicating between the kitchen staff. Some servers bringing food to clients' rooms have faced sexual harassment, such as guests making sexual comments.\n\nExecutive chefs also known as head chef are responsible for overseeing the operations that occur in the kitchen. They monitor and maintain the quality of all dishes that are served to customers, create menus, invent new dishes, and supervise the kitchen staff. Their responsibilities tend to be administrative in nature. The executive chef is mostly coordinating the other cooks as well as inspecting the kitchen equipment for sanitary reasons to keep with sanitation policies, they can also hire and train, maintaining food ingredient stocks.\n\nThe kitchen staff are responsible for preparing the food according to service standards and work procedures. They assist chefs as they cook, evaluate the quality of ingredients, and place orders with suppliers. In addition, they schedule the delivery of food or beverages and supervise kitchen production as part of their duties. Kitchen staff usually have a large range of jobs within the fast-paced kitchen, though they are mostly used to assist head cooks and other staff members with the meal preparation. Basic food preparation includes organizing the kitchen and ingredient preparation to make cooking and presenting the meal as efficient as possible, though it also includes washing, cutting and peeling. They also properly store the ingredients in the kitchen, storeroom and cold storage even moving supplies if necessary, proper cleaning and sanitizing of equipment, dishes, floors, counter-tops and cutting boards to maintain sanitation and health standards. \n\nThe housekeeping manager, similar to other manager roles, is responsible for planning, organizing and developing the housekeeping departments. They oversee staffing, training of the staff and scheduling. They manage daily activities such as the cleaning, seating areas, washroom, restaurants, suites and all public areas, guaranteeing customer satisfaction through effective planning and organisation of team members, supervision of housekeeping and grounds keeping staff, maintaining supplies, equipment and budget, recruiting and training staff and even conducting inspections of public areas.\n\nA housekeeping supervisor role is to oversee the activities of the staff that clean the facilities to make sure of the sanitation, orderly and appeal of the rooms is up to high standard in the hotel but can also include other establishments such as hospitals and anything in a similar regard. they may also assist in the duties of other staff members and inspect the work, they also address the complaints and inquires about the housekeeping service as well as recruit and train new staff members. \n\nThe continental breakfast attendant's main role is to provide a hot and cold breakfast buffet service throughout the morning. A continental breakfast usually includes coffee, juice, jam, fruit, and baked goods such as bread and pastries, items chosen because they are shelf-stable, and can be served in portion sizes that are appropriate for large groups of people. The attendant cleans the serving area during the breakfast, refills empty serving dishes or jugs and supplies (e.g., napkins), ensures equipment such as toasters and coffeemakers are functioning well, and answers patron questions. After breakfast, the attendant cleans and prepares the area for the next morning. The attendant may also prepare ingredients, refill beverage dispensers, clean and replenish utensils. Attendants may even do duties similar to a waiter for customers that have special needs. Attendants may have to do paperwork or record-keeping.\n\nThey can serve multiple roles, but the main function is the food runner acts as the \"middle man\" between the customer and the kitchen staff, both delivering food to the correct table as quick as possible, assisting staff with the priority of orders and addressing any customer issue that suddenly arises. Generally any business that serves food to customers have food runners such as bars and coffee shops and even room service, being able to switch between front and back of the house. Food runner's duties are to deliver food, identifying customers questions and complaints and addressing those appropriately, greeting guests, providing and explaining the menu, inspecting the food, clearing and cleaning tables.\n\nHotel security monitor the security system in the restaurant and communal areas of the hotel. They establish and maintain emergency procedures, and identify and implement risk management programs on order to be prepared for an unlikely emergency situation such as food poisoning.\n\n\n\nSome hospitals have started to provide room service for their patients' convenience. Patients are able to order the food of their choice from a menu at a time that is suitable for them. Hospital staff may need to assist patients to ensure that they comply with their dietary restrictions. Visiting guests may order from the room service for a fee.\n\n"}

In 1886, Maulbronn officially became a German town and was an administrative centre until 1938. The return of many displaced persons following the Second World War significantly raised the local population.\n\nOf particular note is the town's monastery, Maulbronn Abbey, which features prominently in Hermann Hesse's novel, \"Beneath the Wheel\". The former Cistercian monastery has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993.\n\nLegend has it that the settlement was founded by monks who followed a mule to a valley with a source of clean water. The valley was also blessed with large deposits of soft sandstone for building. The monks built the original abbey and erected a fountain to honour the mule. The town name means mule fountain.\n\nAccording to legend, the monks of Maulbronn also invented the pasta dish Maultasche.\n\nMaulbronn has a beautiful lake which is called \"Tiefersee\" which stands for \"deep lake\".

{"id": "1915136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915136", "title": "Code-talker paradox", "text": "Code-talker paradox\n\nA code-talker paradox is a situation in which a language prevents communication. As an issue in linguistics, the paradox raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in philosophy of language. \n\nThe term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by Mark Baker to describe the Navajo code talking used during World War II. Code talkers are able to create a language mutually intelligible to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, cryptanalysts were unable to decode messages in Navajo, even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.\n\nBaker solves the paradox with the theory of universal grammar. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language.\n\n\n"}

Grellan was assigned a site to build a church at Achadh Fionnabhrach, by Duach Gallach, a King of Connacht. Duach Gallach granted Grellan the site to build his church after Grellan brought back to life by baptism Duach Gallach's stillborn son, Eoghan Sriabh.\n\nAchadh Fionnabhrach has been ever since called Craobh Ghrealláin (Irish for 'the branch of Grellan'), named after the branch which king Duach and St. Patrick presented to St. Grellan, in token of possession. The king also ordered that seven garments should be given from every chieftain's wife as a tribute to the young cleric.\n\nAfter this Grellan proceeded to the upper third of Connacht and continued to traverse the country but he eventually settled and established a church at Cill Cluaine (or Kilclooney, near present-day Ballinasloe) in Magh Seincheineoil, a territory occupied by the Firbolg and led by Cian d'Fhearaibh Bolg.\n\nThe area was invaded by the Gaelic tribe of Colla da Chrioch from the Kingdom of Oriel, led the semi-legendary figure Maine Mór who was accompanied by his father, Eochaidh Ferdaghiall, and his two sons Breasal mac Maine Mór and Amhalgaidh. His battalions descended on the territory and plundered the country. Acting as an intermediary, Grellan negotiated a peace between the parties. To consummate the peace, Cian d'Fhearaibh Bolg organised a feast to which Amlaff was invited but subsequently taken hostage.\n\nAmlaff was now the bargaining power the Firbolgs held over the Gaels. While in captivity however, Amlaff managed offend a Firbolg official through a romantic entanglement with his wife. Amlaff was killed, and with him died the Firbolg's leverage against the Gaels. With the Gaels expecting a truce, Cian decided to catch them off guard with a surprise attack.\n\nFrom the door of his church, Grellan became aware of the build-up of the Firbolg's weapons. As he was the guarantee between the two factions, this development put him in a precarious situation. Legend states that he prayed to God, who caused the Firbolgs to be swallowed into the earth at the bog of Magh Liach during battle with the Gaels.\n\nGrellan subsequently granted the territory to Maine Mór and his people. The area became known as Uí Maine. The Uí Maine paid tribute to Grellan, who became the patron saint of the clans and families who descended from Maine Mór, including the Ó Ceallaigh (O'Kelly), Ó Madadhan (Madden), Ó Neachtáin (Naughton), Ó Domhnalláin (Donnellan), Ó Maolalaidh (Lally/Mullally) and Ó Fallamháin (Fallon) families.\n\nSt. Grellan's Crozier, or \"Bachall Grealláin\" was given to the Uí Maine with the territory, and was thenceforth borne in their standard on the battlefield. This crozier was in existence up to the early 19th century. The history of the Baċall Ġreallán is recounted by Patrick Egan in his history of \"The Parish of Ballinasloe,\" from the time of the saint, during its time as a treasured relic of the Hy Many, until it was conveyed into the possession of Shane Crannelly as hereditary keeper of the relic, according to John O'Donovan writing in Ballinasloe in 1837. At this time, the Baċall was used as a talisman in depositions. The following year Thomas O'Curry arrived in the bally per the Ordnance Survey to learn that the Crozier of St. Ġreallán had been condemned and discarded. Crannelly's kin had inherited the staff; attended church; heard Father O'Connor's sermon against their family for charging fees to swear oaths on the Baċall; after which the treasure disappeared. Egan concludes the mystery thus \"a treasured relic from the dawn of Christianity in Ireland, though handed down with loving care through thirteen centuries, was in the end put to base use, before finally disappearing from sight, perhaps forever.\"\n\nSt Grellan's Gaelic football club is named after Grellan, as is St Grellan's Terrace, a public housing estate, in Ballinasloe. St Grellan's Boys' National School, now Scoil an Chroí Naofa, was also named in his honour. Also in Ballinasloe, Grellan's Well is located in the townland of Tobergrellan (meaning Grellan's Well).\n\nAlthough rare, Grellan is a boy's first name.\n\n"}

As a teenager, he joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia and was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914. His brother, Veljko, was also involved in the plot. Čubrilović was convicted of treason by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and given a sixteen-year sentence; his brother was sentenced to death and executed. Čubrilović was released from prison at war's end and studied history at the universities of Zagreb and Belgrade. In 1937, he delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he advocated the expulsion of the Albanians from Yugoslavia. Two years later, he became a history professor at the University of Belgrade. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Čubrilović was arrested by the Germans and sent to the Banjica concentration camp, where he remained imprisoned for much of the war.\n\nAs World War II drew to a close, Čubrilović urged the Yugoslav authorities to expel ethnic minorities (particularly Germans and Hungarians) from the country. At war's end, he became a government minister. In his position as Minister of Agriculture, he pushed for the implementation of agricultural reforms. In his later years, he distanced himself from the Pan-Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth and expressed regret over Franz Ferdinand's assassination. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill the Archduke.\n\nVaso Čubrilović was born in Bosanska Gradiška on 14 January 1897. His was a well known family from the region of Bosanska Krajina. He was a relative of Vaso Vidović, a leader of the 1875–77 Herzegovina Uprising who attended the Congress of Berlin. Čubrilović finished primary school in his hometown. He went on to attend the Tuzla High School but was expelled for refusing to stand during the Austro-Hungarian national anthem. He subsequently enrolled in the sixth class of the Sarajevo Gymnasium.\n\nČubrilović had been a member of Young Bosnia prior to the outbreak of World War I. He and his older brother were involved in the conspiracy to assassinate of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914. The younger Čubrilović was the youngest of the conspirators. He was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosanska Dubica on 3 July. The main conspirators were tried in a military prison in Sarajevo. The state attorney charged twenty-two of the accused with high treason and first-degree murder and three with complicity to commit murder. The trial began on 12 October and lasted until 23 October. Čubrilović was only 17 years and six months old at the time. The Čubrilović brothers, Ivo Kranjčević and Neđo Kerović were defended by the lawyer Rudolf Cistler. At the trial, Čubrilović stated that the mistreatment of South Slavs by the Habsburgs motived him to take part in the plot. \"I can state that the monarchy is ruled by the Germans and the Magyars while the Slavs are oppressed,\" he said. Asked if he identified as a Serb or a Croat, Čubrilović declared himself a Serbo-Croat. \"It means I don't consider myself solely a Serb,\" he explained, \"but that I must work for Croatia as well as for Serbia.\" Though the trial ended on 23 October, sentencing did not occur until five days later. Čubrilović was convicted of treason and given a sixteen-year sentence. He had initially been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. When asked his religious beliefs, he identified as an atheist, prompting the judges to add another three years. A further three were added after he refused to express remorse for the Archduke's death and blamed Austria-Hungary for starting the war. His brother Veljko was sentenced to death and hanged.\n\nČubrilović was initially sent to serve out his sentence in Zenica. On 2 March, he and some of his co-conspirators were relocated to the Möllersdorf military prison, near Vienna. They were re-tried in Travnik on 14 June 1915, and had several years added to their sentences. Čubrilović was subsequently moved back to Möllersdorf. On 13 September 1917, the authorities decided to move almost all the surviving conspirators to Zenica prison. He remained imprisoned in Zenica until the end of the war.\n\nČubrilović completed his high school education in Sarajevo in 1919. First, he enrolled at the University of Zagreb to study history, but later transferred to the University of Belgrade, where he received a Bachelor's degree in history in 1922. In 1929, he obtained his Ph.D at the University of Belgrade with a thesis titled \"The Bosnian Uprising 1875–1878\". In the meantime, he had worked as a history teacher at high schools in Sremska Mitrovica, Sarajevo and Belgrade. The historian Vladimir Ćorović subsequently selected Čubrilović as his personal assistant. In 1934, Čubrilović became a docent at the university. From 1921 to 1939, he was an active member of the Agrarian Party.\n\nIn 1937, Čubrilović delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he outlined possible methods the Yugoslav government could use to coerce Albanians into leaving Kosovo. Čubrilović argued that the only way to \"deal\" with the Albanians was to use the \"brute force of an organized state\". \"If we do not settle accounts with them,\" he opined, \"in 20–30 years we shall have to cope with a terrible irredentism.\" He was highly critical of government attempts to colonize parts of Kosovo as he felt they were ineffective. Čubrilović also criticized the government for not having seized the opportunity presented by a 1918–21 revolt among Kosovo Albanians to force them out of the region. He stated that the benefits of the forced expulsion of Albanians outweighed any risk since \"a threat to Yugoslav security would be removed\". He reasoned: \"At a time when Germany can expel tens of thousands of Jews and Russia can shift millions of people from one part of the continent to another, the shifting of a few Albanians will not lead to the outbreak of a world war.\" The content of the lecture was preserved in writing, came into the possession of Yugoslavia's military intelligence service and was preserved at the Military Archive in Belgrade. It was not made public until 1988. In the ensuing decades, Albanian historians have referred to it as evidence of a plot to evict Kosovo's Albanian population, usually claiming it was written at the request of the Yugoslav General Staff. However, there is no evidence to this effect. Professor Sabrina P. Ramet doubts the lecture had much influence on the Yugoslav authorities, who were already long committed to seeing Kosovo Albanians leave the province and emigrate to Turkey.\n\nIn 1939, Čubrilović became a professor at the University of Belgrade. In April 1941, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia, and Čubrilović was arrested by the Gestapo in the coastal town of Risan. From there, he was transferred to Belgrade and imprisoned at the Banjica concentration camp, where he spent much of the war. Once German forces had been forced out of Serbia, Čubrilović became an advisor to Yugoslavia's new communist leader, Josip Broz Tito. The anti-Serb pogroms of World War II, particularly those orchestrated by the Albanians, again directed Čubrilović's attention to the status of Yugoslavia's national minorities. On 17 November 1944, in Belgrade, Čubrilović presented a memorandum titled \"The Minority Problem in the New Yugoslavia\" () to the communist authorities. In it, he advised Tito's government to expel all of Yugoslavia's Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Romanians and Albanians. Indeed, virtually all ethnic Germans living in the country were forced out, as were many Hungarians and Romanians. \"The minority problem,\" Čubrilović wrote, \"if we don't solve it now, will never be solved.\" At the time, such suggestions did not come across as particularly radical given that they coincided with the mass expulsion of Germans from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn early 1945, Čubrilović was appointed Minister of Agriculture in Tito's government. In August of that year, he pushed for the implementation of the Law on State Agricultural Farms, which emphasized the need to undertake economic measures that would rebuild and strengthen Yugoslavia's agricultural sector. Čubrilović was later appointed Minister of Forestry. In 1959, he became a correspondent of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU), and in 1961, he was granted full membership. Čubrilović was also a correspondent of the Yugoslav and Bosnian academies of sciences and arts, and a regular member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1976, he became an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In his later years, Čubrilović distanced himself from the Pan Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth. Referring to Franz Ferdinand's assassination, he said: \"We destroyed a beautiful world that was lost forever due to the war that followed.\" In 1986, he expressed public disapproval of the SANU memorandum, which argued that Yugoslavia's Serbs were being discriminated against and called for a fundamental reorganization of the state. In 1987, the Yugoslav Presidency awarded Čubrilović the Order of the Yugoslav Star. Čubrilović died in Belgrade on 11 June 1990, aged 93. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill Franz Ferdinand. He is interred at the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade's New Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Cardross is in the historic geographical county of Dunbartonshire but the modern political local authority of Argyll and Bute.\n\nCardross Village took its name from the historic parish in which it is located and where King Robert the Bruce lived the final years of his life. The Parish of Cardross stretched in area from the River Leven on the west side of Dumbarton to Camus Eskan (near Helensburgh), and stretched as far north to include the village of Renton in the Vale of Leven.\n\nThe distinction between Cardross village and Cardross Parish is particularly important for students of Scottish history. King Robert the Bruce's documented association with ’Cardross’ occurred three centuries prior to the existence of the modern-day village, and at a time when the name referred to the ecclesiastical parish and its church, Cardross Kirk.\n\nThe original piece of land known as ’Cardross’ is at the eastern edge of the historic parish and the western point of the confluence of the rivers Clyde and Leven at the town of Dumbarton, facing across to Dumbarton Rock and Castle. Today the land is known as “sand point” and sits on the edge of Dumbarton's Levengrove Park. The site of medieval Cardross Kirk, and its remains, sits within Levengrove Park.\n\n\"Cardross\" is a name of Brittonic origin. The first part of the name is the Brittonic or Pictish \"*carden\", generally meaning \"a wild place, a thicket\" (Middle Welsh \"cardden\"). The second is the element \"-rōs\", \"moor, promontory\" (Welsh \"rhos\"). In other words, a thicketed promontory of land.\n\nThe settlement of Cardross developed around a 17th-century church. The mother kirk of Cardross Parish was relocated in 1653, west from its medieval site on the western bank of the River Leven to support a fledgling ferry community on the northern bank of the River Clyde.\n\nModern-day ‘Ferry Road’ runs the short distance between the A814 and the River Clyde at the easternmost extremity of Cardross Village (closest to Dumbarton).\n\nThe new settlement eventually took its name from the church, and the parish that it served, as the 17th-century worshippers headed for the re-located ‘Cardross’ every Sunday.\n\nToday no remains of that original Cardross Village church can be found but the Graveyard is still in use and contains several 17th-century gravestones.\n\nRobert the Bruce purchased the portions of lands of Pillanflatt from the Earl of Lennox, lying on the western bank of the River Leven, Dunbartonshire, in the Parish of Cardross, in 1326. In 1329, he died at the manorial house that he built there.\n\nA field on the bank of River Leven south of the village of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, called the Mains of Cardross, is thought to have been the location of his royal manor, none of which remains today. In 2017, Dumbarton Football Club's proposed new stadium was refused planning permission, with one of the objections being its likely placement on the medieval Bruce site.\n\n north-west of Cardross is a peninsula called Ardmore Point. This privately owned area of land has a nature trail and is considered a Regionally Important Geographical Site (RIGS) due to unique rock formations including an exposed sea cliff. It is a popular fishing and bird-spotting area and grey seals can also be seen here.\n\nThere are a number of businesses, including a sawmill, car mechanic, a Co-operative Food Store, newsagents, pharmacy, post office, plumber's merchant, an Indian style take-away, a couple of hairdressers, soap shop and a jewellers.\n\nArdardan Estate is a working farm with a farm shop, plant nursery and tea room and is situated outside Cardross near Ardmore Point, but closer to the town of Helensburgh.\n\nThe town possesses a golf course, bowling, tennis and football clubs. Paul Lawrie won the Scottish Professional Golf Championship which was held at Cardross Golf Course in 1992.\n\nCardross has its own pre-school and primary school.\n\nCardross railway station has direct links to both and stations on the North Clyde Line; the station is operated by Abellio ScotRail.\n\nA bus service is provided by First Glasgow.\n\nGeilston Garden, a National Trust for Scotland property, is located on the north west edge of the village.\n\nThere is also a ruined church, which was bombed in May 1942 during World War 2. The reason for Cardross being targeted by German bombers remains unclear, locals have speculated buildings in the village might have been mistaken as a shipyard or an oil storage facility.\n\nThe village has two places of worship: Cardross Parish Church (Church of Scotland) and a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to Saint Mahew. The original parish church was bombed during the Second World War and its ruins are located next to the former Church of Scotland manse.\n\nThere are nearly fifty listed buildings/structures in Cardross, two of which are category A.\n\nSome structures of note:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He married Clara, with whom he fathered three children: Robin, Rhonda, and Dana. With Monika, he has his first son Todd. With Felicia, he has his youngest son Handsome. He is now married to Angel. He has 6 grandchildren: Lonna, Jenae, Beau, Chassie, Clarissa and Delilah.\n\nFanning started wrestling in 1964 as Big Jim Vallen. He went to the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the 1970s as Handsome Jimmy Valiant and formed a team with Johnny Valiant that would dominate the tag team scene for a while as WWWF Tag Team champions. In the later 1960s in the WWA, they were managed by Bobby Heenan.\n\nValiant had entered the WWWF as a babyface, originally known as \"Gentleman Jim Valiant,\" but quickly switched to heel. He had title matches against champion Pedro Morales in secondary arenas, such as Philadelphia, and feuded with short-term tag partner Chief Jay Strongbow. Jimmy and his kayfabe brother Johnny held the tag belts and main evented Madison Square Garden against Chief Jay Strongbow and Bruno Sammartino (Strongbow and Sammartino won 2 out of 3 falls, but one fall via disqualification; hence the belts didn't change hands).\n\nDuring the late 1970s – early 1980s, Valiant was a central player in the Memphis, Tennessee wrestling scene. He feuded regularly with Jerry Lawler and teamed with Bill Dundee to dominate the tag team matches of that time. He even recorded a song, \"The Ballad of Handsome Jimmy\", which was used in wrestling arenas as his entry music and became a mainstay on some Memphis radio stations for a few years. Despite the Memphis promotion desperately wanting to keep him in Memphis full-time, even offering to buy him a house in Memphis according to Jerry Lawler's biography, Valiant decided to move on after holding the AWA Southern Heavyweight title for roughly a year. Valiant also spent a brief amount of time in Jim Crockett Promotions in the late 1970s as the heel King James Valiant managed by Lord Alfred Hayes.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Valiant returned as a babyface to NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions as \"Boogie Woogie Man\" Jimmy Valiant and called his fans \"The Street People\". His theme music around this time was \"Boy From New York City\", by The Manhattan Transfer. While in Jim Crockett Promotions, he would sometimes appear in a black bandit-style mask and call himself Charlie Brown from Outta Town. This usually occurred when Valiant was (in kayfabe) banned from wrestling. Charlie Brown was billed as someone other than Valiant, despite \"Brown\" having Valiant's legendarily prodigious beard.\n\nJanuary 1984, Valiant was attacked by Paul Jones and The Assassins. They tied him to the wrestling ring ropes so that Jones could cut his beard off. This led to a grudge match (with hyped supershow called 'Boogie Man Jam '84' in Greensboro, North Carolina. For this match, Dusty Rhodes was in Valiant's corner and tied by a rope to Paul Jones. Valiant defeated Assassin II, who was unmasked and revealed as Hercules Hernandez. Due to the beard cutting attack, he feuded heavily with Paul Jones and his army of wrestlers, from 1984 through to late 1986. This army of wrestlers included The Barbarian, Baron von Raschke, Teijo Khan, and The Assassins. During this three-year feud, Valiant received help from Héctor Guerrero and \"Raging Bull\" Manny Fernandez. Although Jimmy Valiant would lose a Loser Leaves Town Tuxedo Street Fight to Paul Jones at Starrcade 1984 in Greensboro, North Carolina the feud with many from the Paul Jones stable continued, which would come to include Abdullah The Butcher. In 1985, Valiant and Ragin' Bull Manny Fernandez formed a team called \"B and B Connection\" (\"Boogie Woogie\" and \"Bull\"). \n\nDuring The Great American Bash 1986 summer shows, Paul Jones adopted a military style look in his long feud with Valiant and labeled his stable of wrestlers \"The Army\". Valiant would beat Shaska Whatley in a hair vs hair match, but with outside interference lost a hair vs hair match to Paul Jones only weeks later. In the fall of 1986, The Ragin Bull Manny Fernandez, Valiant's best friend accepted Jones' money and turned on Valiant, starting a feud between the two. Paul Jones at this point shortened his army to his newly acquired tag team of Ragin Bull and Rick Rude. The war between Valiant and Paul Jones climaxed at Starrcade 1986 with Valiant putting up the hair of his valet Big Mama against the hair of Paul Jones in a No DQ Match which Valiant won (while the Ragin Bull was placed in a cage above the ring).\n\nIn the late 1980s, he teamed with Hector Guerrero (then masked as Laser Tron) and Bugsy McGraw and feuded with The New Breed. When Jim Crockett Promotions became WCW, Valiant left and returned to Memphis to wrestle in the USWA. In 1990 he twice won the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship from Jerry Lawler, losing it back to him both times.\n\nSince then, Valiant has primarily wrestled in the independent having his most recent match on March 2, 2019 in Johnson City, Tennessee. He now enjoys his time with his wife Angel and training wrestlers at Boogie's Wrestling Camp located in Shawsville, Virginia. Jimmy currently wrestles under the ACW Banner (American Championship Wrestling) around the Roanoke Virginia Area. He has also recently wrestled with George South, Stan Lee and Ricky Morton in ASW Wrestling and New OCW in Ashland, KY with Matty B and Violet Rayne against Beau and Misty James and Scotty Ace.\n\nValiant remains in the wrestling world today with continuing to appear at independent shows signing autographs while his students appear in a few matches on the card. He keeps in touch with fans through his official Weekly website.And he is especially looking forward to stepping into the ring in 2020 and continuing his decades long career officially beginning his 7th decade in the business.\n\nMost recently, Valiant lent his name to a foreword for a fiction novel called \"Only The Beginning\". It is a book set in the 1980s about a girl's life during high school. While the book is not wrestling related, the author Jason Strecker is a personal friend of Valiant's and in the forward Valiant responds to his friendship with the author along with the book's message of being of strong character and doing positive actions for others.

As a senior, he had 3 sacks and 61 tackles on defense, and rushed for over 1,400 yards and 25 touchdowns on offense.\n\nOn November 4, 2009, it was reported that Hagler had suffered a ruptured biceps and would be on injured reserve for the rest of the season. Hagler contributed to the Colts' super bowl victory by recovering a fumble on a kickoff, fumbled by Gabe Reid.\n\nHagler signed with the Seattle Seahawks on August 10, 2010. He was waived at the end of training camp.\n\nHagler re-signed with the Indianapolis Colts on September 29, 2010. He was waived on October 7, but re-signed with the Colts on October 10. During a key week 15 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hagler returned an onside kick from Josh Scobee 41 yards for a touchdown. The Colts ended up winning the game, 34-24, controlling their own destiny from that point on by winning the AFC South crown.\n\n"}

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nA native of Cleveland, Ohio, Mack played college football at the end and tackle positions for the University of Michigan from 1963 to 1965. He was a starter on the 1964 Michigan team that won the Big Ten Conference championship and defeated Oregon State in the 1965 Rose Bowl. He was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player in 1965 and was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 2006.\n\nMack was selected by the Los Angeles Rams with the second pick in the 1966 NFL Draft and played at the left guard position for the Rams for 13 seasons from 1966 to 1978. During his NFL career, Mack played in 11 Pro Bowls and appeared in 184 consecutive games, 162 as a starter, over 13 seasons.\n\nMack was born in 1943 in Cleveland, Ohio, and attended Cleveland Heights High School. He was the son of Ray Mack, a Cleveland native who played Major League Baseball as a second baseman from 1938 to 1947, including eight seasons with the Cleveland Indians. Mack became an Eagle Scout in 1960, and he later became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.\n\nMack enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1962 and played college football for Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1963 to 1965. As a sophomore in 1963, he played at the end position and spent most of the season on the bench. After the 1963 season, Mack switched to the tackle position at the suggestion of Michigan coach Bump Elliott. Mack later referred to the position change as \"the big break of my life,\" an opportunity that \"turned my whole experience in terms of football around.\"\n\nAs a junior, he started seven games at right tackle and won the Meyer Morton Award for the 1964 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 9–1 record, outscored opponents 235–83, and defeated Oregon State in the 1965 Rose Bowl. As a senior, he started seven games at right tackle for the 1965 Michigan team, and he was selected by the Associated Press as a first-team tackle on the 1965 All-Big Ten Conference football team. Mack was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 2006.\n\nWhile attending Michigan, Mack was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.\n\nMack was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round, as the second overall pick, in the 1966 NFL Draft. During Mack's rookie season with the Rams, starter Don Chuy was injured during the fifth game of the season, allowing Mack to move into the lineup. He started eight games during the 1966 season and became a fixture for the Rams at the left guard position for the next 13 seasons. During his NFL career, Mack never missed a game due to injury, appearing in 184 consecutive contests, the third longest streak in Rams history behind Merlin Olsen and Jack Youngblood.\n\nDuring Mack's career with the Rams, the club enjoyed a .720 winning percentage with a won-lost-tie record of 129-48-7, won their division eight times (1967, 1969, and 1973-1978), and reached four NFC championship games. In 1973, the Rams scored led the NFL with 388 points (27.7 points/game). In 1974, the Rams lost to the Minnesota Vikings by four points in the , with a controversial penalty call against Mack costing the Rams a touchdown. The Rams had the ball at the one-yard line on second down when the Vikings' Alan Page made contact with Mack; the referee called illegal procedure on Mack, but replays showed that Mack had not moved. After the game, Mack insisted he had not moved but credited Page with \"a smart play\" in making contact since a penalty, if called against the Vikings, would have been meaningless.\n\nMack was selected to 11 Pro Bowls, the first coming after his second season in 1967. He missed only one Pro Bowl appearance the rest of his career (1976). Mack's 11 invitations earned him a third-place tie with Bob Lilly and Ken Houston for the most selections of all time. Mack was selected first-team All-Pro four times (1969, 1971, 1973, 1974) and second-team All-Pro four times (1968, 1970, 1972, and 1975). In addition he was named All-NFC eight times between 1970 and 1978.\n\nMack announced in late November 1978 that he would retire at the end of the 1978 NFL season. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Mack worked as an engineer, using the engineering degree he received at the University of Michigan.

{"id": "1915182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915182", "title": "Paul Temple", "text": "Paul Temple\n\nPaul Temple is a fictional character created by English writer Francis Durbridge. Temple is a professional author of crime fiction and an amateur private detective. With his wife Louise, affectionately known as 'Steve' in reference to her journalistic pen name 'Steve Trent', he solves whodunnit crimes through subtle, humorously articulated deduction. Always the gentleman, the strongest expletive he employs is \"by Timothy\".\n\nCreated for the BBC radio serial \"Send for Paul Temple\" in 1938, the Temples featured in more than 30 BBC radio dramas, twelve , four British feature films, a dozen novels, and a BBC television series. A \"Paul Temple\" daily newspaper strip ran in the \"London Evening News\" for two decades.\n\nPaul Temple was a professional novelist. While he possessed no formal training as a detective, his background in constructing crime plots for his novels enabled him to apply deductive reasoning to solve cases whose solution had eluded Scotland Yard.\n\nOver the course of each case, Temple eschewed formal interviews or other police techniques, in favour of casual conversations with suspects and witnesses. Yet even this informal style of investigation invariably precipitated attempts by the suspects to hamper him, through traps, ambushes, even assassination attempts. Surviving these, Temple would arrange a cocktail party or similar social event at which he unmasked the perpetrator.\n\nAt the end of each tale, Paul, Steve and Sir Graham Forbes held a \"post mortem\". Here, Paul explained why certain events in the serial took place, which of these had been red herrings, and which had been genuine clues. Some elements of the plot had already been explained during the serial, while others were occasionally never fully explained, due to limitations of time.\n\nThe Paul Temple characters and formula were developed in a succession of BBC radio serials broadcast between 1938 and 1968, with several voice actors portraying the Temples. The longest-running team, and the most popular with audiences, was Peter Coke (pronounced \"Cooke\") and Marjorie Westbury, who starred together in every serial made between 1954 and 1968 — and Marjorie Westbury also co-starred as Steve Temple in every serial aired between 1945 and 1954.\n\nThe radio series was a collaboration between writer Francis Durbridge and BBC producer Martyn C Webster, both of whom worked on every one of the radio broadcasts aired over the thirty years from 1938 to 1968. Durbridge was still at college when he approached Webster, who then was with the BBC's regional service in the Midlands, with his proposal for a mystery series about a gentleman detective.\n\nThe introductory and closing music for the majority of the long-running series was \"Coronation Scot\", composed by Vivian Ellis, though the earliest serials (those aired prior to December 1947) used an excerpt from \"Scheherazade\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nInitially the serials aired only on the BBC's regional service in the Midlands. As they gained in popularity, they were aired nationally instead on the Home Service. But in 1945 they found a new permanent home on the recently founded BBC Light Programme, which too was a national station, where they remained (save for occasional repeats on Home Service) until the final serial in 1968. Repeats of selected serials then continued to be heard on Radio 4 (the new name for the Home Service) during the 1980s, and as late as 1992 (when \"The Spencer Affair\" was repeated to celebrate Francis Durbridge's 80th birthday).\n\nMany of the earliest serials, in which the eponymous hero was played by a wide variety of different actors, have not survived the passage of time (largely because these recordings had no value to the BBC once Peter Coke had become synonymous with the lead character). Several were remade in the 1940s, in abridged form, as feature films. However some of the early radio serials do still exist: including \"Paul Temple Intervenes\" from 1942, featuring the first appearance in the series by Marjorie Westbury, in a supporting role, who would later co-star as Mrs Temple. All but one of the serials starring Peter Coke also exist: since 2003 these have been regularly repeated on digital station BBC Radio 7 (now called BBC Radio 4 Extra). In 2006 the station tracked down the then 93-year-old Coke for a half-hour interview programme, \"Peter Coke and the Paul Temple Affair\"; and the actor had also been interviewed extensively in 1998, for the half hour documentary \"Send For Paul Temple\", an episode in the series \"The Radio Detectives\".\n\nBecause no recordings survive for many of the early serials, in 2006 BBC Radio 4 began recreating them, in as authentic a manner as possible: as mono productions, employing vintage microphones and sound effects, and using the original scripts. In all cases Crawford Logan starred as Paul Temple with Gerda Stevenson as Steve, in place of the original leads. The first of these broadcasts, in August 2006, was a new 8-part production of \"Paul Temple and the Sullivan Mystery\", originally aired in 1947. A new production of \"The Madison Mystery\", from 1949, aired between May and July 2008, followed by the 1947 serial \"Paul Temple and Steve\" in June and July 2010. \"A Case for Paul Temple\", from 1946, was transmitted in August and September 2011. The final such production to date was \"Paul Temple and the Gregory Affair\", aired in 2013 (the longest of all the serials, running to ten episodes). Many of these new productions featured Welsh character actor Gareth Thomas as the head of Scotland Yard. Each of the new recordings was also released on CD.\n\nPaul Temple's catchphrase, \"by Timothy\", first occurred in episode two of the first ever serial, \"Send for Paul Temple\". As spoken by Kim Peacock in the 1940s serials, it made Temple sound like Wilfrid Hyde-White (it was a phrase Hyde-White frequently used, particularly in the BBC radio series \"The Men from the Ministry\"). Interviewed in 2006, Peter Coke said he hated the phrase, because even in the 1950s he thought it sounded old-fashioned.\n\nIn 1998, on the death of author Francis Durbridge, the BBC made a radio documentary about Paul Temple written and presented by noted authority Professor Jeffrey Richards, entitled \"Send For Paul Temple\" (aired on 20 May 1998), which included extracts from surviving recordings held in the BBC sound archives going right back to the first ever serial in 1938.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1952 Paul Temple appeared in four feature films, each an abridged version of one of the early (hence, now lost) BBC radio serials. These films were distributed by Butcher's Film Service based in the North of England (best known as a distributor of Northern comedies, including the fifteen \"Old Mother Riley\" films). All were made in the years \"before\" Peter Coke was cast as the definitive Paul Temple in the radio series in 1954. Marjorie Westbury \"had\" been established in the radio series by this point, but was not cast in these films because she was not a film actress.\n\n\nFrancis Durbridge licensed the television rights in his characters to the BBC, who between 1969 and 1971 produced fifty two colour 50-minute episodes of a drama series entitled \"Paul Temple\". It starred Francis Matthews as Paul Temple, and co-starred Ros Drinkwater as his wife Steve, with George Sewell as Sammy Carson. None of the television scripts were written by Durbridge.\n\nThe 52 episodes, made over 4 seasons, were co-produced with ZDF, a West German television station based in Munich, making it the very first international co-production of the TV era. This made it practicable, in terms of the show's budget, to film location scenes for the series overseas (i.e. in Munich and other cities in West Germany). The episodes were subsequently dubbed into German, using German voice artists, for broadcast by ZDF to German audiences.\n\nOnly 16 of the 52 episodes currently exist in the BBC's television archive with their original English soundtrack, and only 11 of these are in colour (for the other 5, only black and white telerecordings survive); the other 36 episodes are lost. Many of the missing episodes survive, in colour, in ZDF TV's archives in Germany, but with dubbed German soundtracks.\n\nThe theme tune of the television series was composed by Ron Grainer, who composed very many TV themes for the BBC during the 1960s.\n\nMany of the BBC \"Paul Temple\" radio serials were novelised between 1938 and 1989 by Francis Durbridge working with collaborators from his original scripts. The first was \"Send for Paul Temple\" (1938) with John Thewes. 'Thewes' is thought to have been a pseudonym for Charles Hatton, with whom Durbridge collaborated on the following four Temple novelisations up until 1948. All of these were rapidly adapted from the original scripts in order to capitalise on the popularity of the radio serial. Publicity for \"Send for Paul Temple\" described it as \"the novel of the thriller that created a BBC fan-mail record\". Durbridge used a co-author because he regarded himself as a writer of dialogue, a scriptwriter rather than a novelist. The two novels with Douglas Rutherford (\"The Tyler Mystery\", 1957 and \"East of Algiers\", 1959) appeared under the pen name 'Paul Temple'. \"The Tyler Mystery\" is unusual in giving Temple's wife Steve a more central role. \"East of Algiers\" was partly based on the 1947 radio serial \"Paul Temple and the Sullivan Mystery\".\n\n\nBetween 19 November 1951 and 1 May 1971, whilst the character was at the height of his popularity on radio and television, \"Paul Temple\" was adapted as a daily newspaper strip in the London \"Evening News\". The strip was written by (and credited in-page to) Francis Durbridge himself.\n\nUntil 1954 the strip was drawn by Alfred Sindall. From 1954 onward it was continued by Bill Bailey, John McNamara and Philip Mendoza. Selected editions from the strips drawn by John McNamara were reprinted by an obscure South London magazine publisher, Micron, in a short lived series in 1964. At no stage did the strip feature recognisable portraits of the then-current stars of the radio series, Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury.\n\nAll the surviving English-language radio episodes, including the 1940 Canadian remake of \"Send for Paul Temple\", have been released on CD by the BBC.\n\nThe 11 surviving colour episodes held in the BBC archives (featuring Francis Matthews and Ros Drinkwater) from the BBC-tv version of \"Paul Temple\" were released on DVD on 6 July 2009 by Acorn Media UK. A further five black-and-white recordings (of originally colour episodes) were released in April 2012. Many of the lost colour episodes exist in the archives of ZDF, the series' German co-producer, with soundtracks dubbed in German (a bare handful in English). The German language versions have begun to be released on DVD in Germany by Fernsehjuwelen DVD.\n\nIn 2010 Renown Pictures Ltd, new owners of The Butchers Library, released on DVD the feature films \"Send For Paul Temple\", \"Paul Temple Returns\" (a.k.a. \"Bombay Waterfront\") and \"Calling Paul Temple\".\n\nDuring 2011–12 all four \"Paul Temple\" movies were released by Renown. A DVD box set of three was released in November 2011; the fourth film, \"Paul Temple's Triumph\", was released singly, initially to Renown Club members only, in March 2012, but has since become generally available.\n\nStarting in February 2016, all the surviving \"Paul Temple\" radio serials were released on CD across four new BBC box sets. These include the previously unreleased 1959 remake of \"Paul Temple and The Gilbert Case\" and the original 1950 Kim Peacock version of \"Paul Temple and The VanDyke Affair\" (the latter featuring Peter Coke in a supporting role) as well as the remakes made in the 21st century.\n\nIn the Netherlands, several of the radio plays were re-recorded using Dutch actors and the title character's name adapted as Paul Vlaanderen. Alfred Sindall drew the initial strips.\n\nIn Germany, twelve Paul Temple radio serials were adapted between 1949 and 1967, each episode (in common with the BBC serials) ending on a cliffhanger. They were listened to by such huge numbers of people that they earned the sobriquet \"Straßenfeger\" (\"street sweepers\"), because they left the streets practically deserted whenever an episode was broadcast. They were performed by actors of national renown, including Luxembourg-born René Deltgen (who played the title role in 11 of the 12 series), Gustav Knuth, Friedrich W Bauschulte, Pinkas Braun, Heinz Schimmelpfennig, Siegfried Wischnewski, Wolfgang Wahl, Günther Ungeheuer and Paul Klinger amongst others.\n\nAll 11 surviving German radio serials have since been released on CD as audiobooks. Two short-lived comic series by the \"Aachener Bildschriftenverlag\" and the \"Luna-Kriminalromane\" are rare collector's items.\n\nIn 2014, an abridged remake of the lost 1949 version of \"Paul Temple and the Gregory Affair\" was aired and released, followed by a live radio show in 2015 with the cast and the WDR Radio Orchestra, hosted by German Comedian Bastian Pastewka.\n\nIn 2015, all four \"Paul Temple\" feature films were released on DVD.\n\nSeven Italian-language Paul Temple serials were produced by RAI between 1953 and 1977, each with a different voice actor in the title role:\n\nBoth 1961 productions are presumed lost.\n\n"}

In his 2007 article, sociologist Stefan Timmermans called the book \"landmark\".\n\nWhen Strauss came to the medical school of the University of California, San Francisco, he looked for an interesting subject that would also get the attention of medical people. Visiting hospitals, he discovered that dying was a highly problematic issue.\n\nStrauss started field studies and six months later hired Glaser from Columbia University. Both researchers already had personal experience with the subject: Strauss had lost his mother and a friend in recent years, Glaser his father.\n\nStrauss and Glaser suspected early on that the expectation of death by both the dying and the relatives were a key to understanding the interactions between those people. Their choice of hospitals and stations allowed them to compare various kinds of expectations. On a premature infant station, mortality was high but the patients were not aware of their impending deaths, while on an oncology station, dying was slow and differences in the awareness of dying were very pronounced. The typical situations were again different for emergency rooms and geriatrics or pediatrics departments.\n\nOut of these field studies grew \"Awareness of Dying\", a theory on the influence of awareness on the interaction with dying people. It differentiated between closed awareness, suspicion, mutual deception, and open awareness. The field studies had shown that the type of awareness had a significant impact on interaction — for instance, if patients were not aware of their dying, the nursing was often limited to the absolutely necessary in order to prevent open awareness.\n\nThe book was the first application of grounded theory. Only two years later did Glaser and Strauss publish \"The Discovery of Grounded Theory\", a book on the methodology they developed while working on \"Awareness of Dying\".\n\n\n"}
