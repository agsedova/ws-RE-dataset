{"id": "1864379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864379", "title": "The Onion Field", "text": "The Onion Field\n\nThe Onion Field is a 1973 nonfiction book by Joseph Wambaugh, a sergeant for the Los Angeles Police Department, chronicling the kidnapping of two plainclothes LAPD officers by a pair of criminals during a traffic stop and the subsequent murder of one of the officers.\n\nOn the night of March 9, 1963, LAPD officers Ian Campbell (age 31) and Karl Hettinger (age 28), both former Marines, were riding in an unmarked police car. They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood. The two men, Gregory Ulas Powell (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. \"Jimmy Youngblood\", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and \"each had a pistol tucked into his trousers.\" Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who \"calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'\" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Campbell was fatally shot. Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse.\n\nThe killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a capital crime under the state's Little Lindbergh Law. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect. Under the Little Lindbergh Law at that time, kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. Today, kidnapping in California is punishable by life imprisonment, either with or without the possibility of parole depending on the circumstances.\n\nIn April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, the daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino. Mancino was the founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of Sirhan Sirhan, who had been convicted of assassinating presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nMancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded. With Valerie Campbell's help, he collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date.\n\nFollowing this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.\n\nThe group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named \"Ian Campbell Square\" in honor of the slain officer. Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway (California State Route 101) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the \"Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway.\"\n\nAlthough Hettinger escaped, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department, and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a police training video was made using his experience as an example of what to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle.\n\nHettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, he was elected a supervisor of Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of liver disease in 1994 at age 59.\n\nPowell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received life sentences. For each, the lower court sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the California Supreme Court ruled in \"California v. Anderson\" (1972) that California's death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAt a parole board hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state corrections officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a \"vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society\".\n\nOn October 18, 2011, the California State Parole Board denied compassionate release for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled.\nPowell died on August 12, 2012, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. He was 79 years old.\n\nSmith was released in 1982 but returned to prison several times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his parole officer, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' Skid Row area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic, California. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent heart attack at age 76.\n\nThe book was adapted into an 1979 film of the same name directed by Harold Becker. It starred John Savage as Karl Hettinger, James Woods as Gregory Powell, Franklyn Seales as Jimmy Smith, and Ted Danson (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell.\n\nTNT's \"Southland\" season 5 episode 9 titled \"Chaos\" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in \"The Onion Field\".\n\nThe \"Adam-12\" episode \"Killing Ground\" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.\n\n"}

The differing colors are derived from oxidation states of the iron in the mud. As with all hot springs, the heat in the caldera forces pressurized water up through the ground, which is expelled here. Also, rising gasses cause the bubbling action. The bubble action in the mud varies with the seasons. In the early summer, the mud is watery from the high water table due to rain and snow melt. By the end of summer, the mud is much thicker as the water table drops.\n\nSeveral significant geysers erupt near the Paint Pots, notably Fountain Geyser, which usually has several large eruptions a day; Clepsydra Geyser, which is active most of the time except following an eruption of Fountain; and powerful but erratic Morning Geyser, active in the latter part of 2018 following a dormancy of nearly five years.

Current ads feature comedian Rob Riggle.\n\nTypical Holiday Inn Express hotels are built from corporate architectural prototypes, and tend to consist of 60–80 rooms, with a mix of suites and standard rooms in North American properties. Because the chain has been undergoing tremendous growth, the majority of Holiday Inn Express hotels are brand new or newly renovated.\n\nThe original Holiday Inn Express properties were no-frills hotels with rooms comparable in quality to those of an upscale hotel, but there would be no room service, swimming pool, restaurant, bar, health club, meeting facilities or other on-site amenities, offering only continental breakfast and an exercise room. However newer Holiday Inn Express do feature most amenities from the higher-end Holiday Inn brand, such as a restaurant and bar, conference rooms, and even a full fitness center with a swimming pool. A major differentiation is location, with Express properties typically found in suburbs and besides freeways, while the upmarket Holiday Inn has been placed in urban areas (including downtown) and often near tourist attractions.\n"}

We can assume that the objects are being held to that surface by gravity, and that the surface in question is the \"top\" of the desk. This establishes the up and down directions. In humans, the visual sensory system can overpower other sources of environmental information, such as the vestibular system. Conflicting signals are resolved by deference to the information gathered by the eyes. For example, astronauts in a space shuttle may experience space sickness when their vestibular systems are indicating free-fall and their visual sensory systems are indicating no movement. Building visual \"hints\" into the environment allows the visual system to override other senses and provide a solid sense of orientation and motion.\n\n"}

(Lte Volar Airlines) was a charter airline based in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. It operated passenger charter services throughout Europe. Its main base was Son Sant Joan Airport, Palma de Mallorca with hubs at Reina Sofía Airport, Tenerife, Gran Canaria International Airport, Lanzarote Airport, Fuerteventura Airport and Barcelona International Airport. \n\nThe airline was established on 29 April 1987, the founding shareholders being Spanish businessmen and the privately owned airline LTU from Germany. It started operations on 1 November 1987.\n\nFrom 1993 until May 2001, LTU was the sole owner having bought out the other original shareholders. On 24 May 2001, LTU sold the airline to a group of Spanish and Italian businessmen, including the Volare Group. As a result, LTE was rebranded Volar Airlines for two successive years 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn 2005, the airline was renamed back to LTE International Airways. The airline was wholly owned by Gasarer.\n\nFrom July 2008, Lte operated flights between Norwich (UK) and Barcelona, Alicante and Palma de Mallorca, and from Winter 2008-2009 it hoped to fly from Norwich to Tenerife, Las Palmas and Málaga.\n\nOn 16 October 2008, Lte abruptly announced that it was suspending all flights -both regular and charter- due to the financial situation of the company, which made it difficult to meet the next few days' operational expenses.

The aircraft touched down on runway 14 just beyond the touchdown zone, approximately 400 m (1,300 ft) beyond the aiming point. The pilots determined that the rate of deceleration was inadequate and applied full reverse thrust and full manual braking in an effort to stop the aircraft, however the normal braking system malfunctioned and the Captain turned the aircraft onto a level grassed area to the right of the runway where it came to rest. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew, however the Air Accidents Investigation Branch made seven safety recommendations in the final accident report.\n"}
{"id": "1864451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864451", "title": "Supermax prison", "text": "Supermax prison\n\nA super-maximum security (supermax) or administrative maximum (ADX) prison is a \"control-unit\" prison, or a unit within prisons, which represent the most secure levels of custody in the prison systems of certain countries. The objective is to provide long-term, segregated housing for inmates classified as the highest security risks in the prison system—the \"worst of the worst\" criminals—and those who pose an extremely serious threat to both national and global security.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Corrections, an agency of the United States government, \"a supermax is a stand-alone unit or part of another facility and is designated for violent or disruptive inmates. It typically involves up to 23-hour-per-day, single-cell confinement for an indefinite period of time. Inmates in supermax housing have minimal contact with staff and other inmates,\" a definition confirmed by a majority of prison wardens.\n\nLeena Kurki and Norval Morris have argued there is no absolute definition of a supermax and that different jurisdictions classify prisons as supermax inconsistently. They identify four general features that tend to characterize supermax prisons:\n\n\nPrisoners are placed not as a punishment of their crimes but by their previous history when incarcerated or based on reliable evidence of an impending disruption. For example, this could be a prisoner who is a gang leader or planning a radical movement. These decisions are made as administrative protection measures and the prisoners in a supermax are deemed by correctional workers as a threat to the safety and security of the institution itself. \n\nThe amount of inmate programming varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions provide entertainment for their inmates in the form of television, educational and self-help programs. Others provide instructors who speak to inmates through the cell door. Some jurisdictions provide no programming to its inmates. In a supermax, prisoners are generally allowed out of their cells for only one hour a day (one-and-a-half hours in California state prisons). Exercise is done in indoor spaces or small, secure, outdoor spaces, usually alone or in a pair and always watched by the guard. Group exercise is offered only to those who are in transition programs. \n\nInmates receive their meals through ports in the doors of their cells.\n\nPrisoners are under constant surveillance, usually with closed-circuit television cameras. Cell doors are usually opaque, while the cells may be windowless. Furnishings are plain, with poured concrete or metal furniture common. Cell walls, and sometimes plumbing, may be soundproofed to prevent communication between the inmates.\n\nAn early form of supermax-style prison unit appeared in Australia in 1975, when \"Katingal\" was built inside the Long Bay Correctional Centre in Sydney. Dubbed the \"electronic zoo\" by inmates, Katingal was a super-maximum security prison block with 40 prison cells having electronically operated doors, surveillance cameras, and no windows. It was closed down two years later over human rights concerns. Since then, some maximum-security prisons have gone to full lockdown as well, while others have been built and dedicated to the supermax standard.\n\nIn September 2001, the Australian state of New South Wales opened a facility in the Goulburn Correctional Centre to the supermax standard. While its condition is an improvement over that of Katingal of the 1970s, this new facility is nonetheless designed on the same principle of sensory deprivation. It has been set up for 'AA' prisoners who have been deemed a risk to public safety and the instruments of government and civil order or are believed to be beyond rehabilitation. Corrections Victoria in the state of Victoria also operates the Acacia and Maleuca units at Barwon Prison which serve to hold the prisoners requiring the highest security in that state including Melbourne Gangland figures such as Tony Mokbel, and Carl Williams, who was murdered in the Acacia unit in 2010.\n\nIn 1985, the state government of São Paulo created an annex to a psychiatric penitentiary hospital meant to house the most violent inmates of the region and established the Penitentiary of Rehabilitation Center of Taubaté, also known as Piranhão. Previously, high-risk inmates were housed at a prison on Anchieta Island; however, that closed down after a bloody massacre. At Taubaté, inmates spent 23 hours of a day in solitary confinement and spent 30 minutes a day with a small group of seven to ten inmates. Ill-treatment of inmates occurred on a daily basis, causing major psychological impairment. \n\nThroughout the 1990s, and the early-2000s, Brazil faced major challenges with gang structures within its prisons. The gang Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) gained notoriety in the prison system and had new members joining within the prisons. Riots were a common occurrence and the gang culture became uncontrollable, leading authorities to pass the controversial Regime Disciplinar Diferenciado (RDD), a culture founded from disciplinary punishment.\n\nBritain's Her Majesty's Prison Service in England and Wales has had a long history in controlling prisoners that are high-risk. Prisoners are categorized into four main classifications (A, B, C, D) with A being \"highly dangerous\" with a high risk of escaping to category D in which inmates \"can be reasonably trusted in open conditions.\" \n\nThe British government formed the Control Review Committee in 1984 to allow for regulating long-term disruptive prisoners. The committee proposed special units (called CRC units) which were formally introduced in 1989 to control for highly-disruptive prisoners to be successfully reintegrated. Yet a series of escapes, riots, and investigations by authorities saw the units come to a close in 1998. They would soon be replaced by Close Supervision Centres (CSC), which was meant to provide relief for long-term prisons which are still used in the present day. It was reported to hold 60 of the most dangerous men in the UK in 2015.\n\nThe United States Penitentiary Alcatraz Island, opened in 1934, has been considered a prototype and early standard for a supermax prison. Supermax prisons began to proliferate within the United States after 1984. Prior to 1984, only one prison in the U.S. met \"supermax\" standards: the Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. By 1999, the United States contained at least 57 supermax facilities, spread across 30–34 states. The push for this type of prison came after two correctional officers at Marion, Merle Clutts, and Robert Hoffman, were stabbed to death in two separate incidents by inmates Thomas Silverstein and Clayton Fountain. This prompted Norman Carlson, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, to call for a new type of prison to isolate uncontrollable inmates. In Carlson's view, such a prison was the only way to deal with inmates who \"show absolutely no concern for human life\".\n\nIn recent years a number of U.S. states have downgraded their supermax prisons, as has been done with Wallens Ridge State Prison, a former supermax prison in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Other supermax prisons that have gained notoriety for their harsh conditions and attendant litigation by inmates and advocates are the former Boscobel (in Wisconsin), now named the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility, Red Onion State Prison (in western Virginia, the twin to Wallens Ridge State Prison), Tamms (in Illinois), and the Ohio State Penitentiary. Placement policies at the Ohio facility were the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case (\"Wilkinson v. Austin\") in 2005 where the Court decided that there had to be some, but only very limited, due process involved in supermax placement.\n\nThere is only one supermax prison remaining in the United States federal system, ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. It houses numerous inmates who have a history of violent behavior in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day to a less restrictive prison within three years. However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. Residents have included Timothy McVeigh, perpetrator of the Oklahoma City Bombing who was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute on 11 June 2001; Terry Nichols, McVeigh's accomplice; Theodore Kaczynski, a domestic terrorist otherwise known as the Unabomber, who once attacked via mail bombs; Robert Hanssen, an American FBI agent turned Soviet spy; Richard Reid, known as the \"Shoe Bomber\", who was jailed for life for attempting to detonate explosive materials in his shoes while on board an aircraft; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the \"Underwear Bomber\"; Richard Lee McNair, a persistent prison escapee; Charles Harrelson, a hitman who was convicted in 1979 of killing Federal Judge John H. Wood Jr.; and Vito Rizzuto, boss of the \"Sixth Mafia Family\", released on 5 October 2012. The Boston Marathon Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is housed there. Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán was also sent here. Deprivation of social contact and the isolation of inmates have some unintended positive and negative effects.\n\nHowever, many states now have created supermax prisons, either as stand-alone facilities or as secure units within lower-security prisons. State supermax prisons include Pelican Bay in California and Tamms in Illinois. The USP in Marion, Illinois was recently downgraded to a medium-security facility. Some facilities such as California State Prison, Corcoran (COR) are hybrids incorporating a supermax partition, housing or having housed high-security prisoners such as Charles Manson.\n\nThere is no set definition of a supermax prison; however, the United States Department of Justice and the National Institute of Corrections agree that \"these units have basically the same function: to provide long-term, segregated housing for inmates classified as the highest security risks in a state’s prison system.\" When making comparisons between supermax prisons and non-supermax prisons, a clear and consistent definition is crucial. As a result, applying one definition to \"supermax housing\" across all states and jurisdictions is very important. Things to consider include types of prisoners, facility conditions and the purpose of the facility is important to the analysis. \n\nConsequently, it is hard to provide a cost-benefit analysis with varying facilities across the board. In these cases, a cost-benefit analysis would be beneficial in the decision to construct a facility, upgrade an existing facility, or determine whether a facility should be closed down. \n\nBuilding a supermax prison, or even retrofitting an old prison, is very expensive. ADX Florence took $60 million to build in 1994. In 2010, when President Obama wanted to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to the Thomson Correctional Center, costs were expected to be $237 million to renovate, retrofit, and set up the center.\n\nCompared to a maximum security facility, supermax prisons are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times more on average. The 1999 average annual cost for inmates at Colorado State Penitentiary, a supermax facility, was $32,383. Compared with the maximum-security prison, the Colorado Correctional Center's annual inmate cost was $18,549. This is mainly due to the technology needed to further maintain a supermax: high-security doors, fortified walls, and sophisticated electronic systems. There are higher costs for staffing these facilities because more people must be hired to maintain the buildings and facilities. These costs are paid by taxpayers and depend on the jurisdiction of the prison. Federal prisons are provided for by federal taxes, while state prisons are provided for by the state.\n\nFurthermore, there are many costs that are harder to measure. Supermax facilities have had a history of psychological and mental health issues to their inmates. These psychological problems present an additional layer of burden to society. Additional costs to society are incurred when inmates have a hard time readjusting to normal life after release, and inmates may even be more inclined to commit even worse offenses to society.\n\nSupermax facilities better prevent inmates from escaping, and offer greater protections against inmates hurting one another than non-supermax prisons do.\n\nSupermax and Security Housing Unit (SHU) prisons are controversial. One criticism is that the living conditions in such facilities violate the United States Constitution, specifically, the Eighth Amendment's proscription against \"cruel and unusual\" punishments. In 1996, a United Nations team assigned to investigate torture described SHU conditions as \"inhuman and degrading\". A 2011 New York Bar association comprehensive study suggested that supermax prisons constitute \"torture under international law\" and \"cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution\". In 2012, a federal class action suit against the Federal Bureau of Prisons and officials who run ADX Florence SHU (\"Bacote v. Federal Bureau of Prisons\", Civil Action 1:12-cv-01570) alleged chronic abuse, failure to properly diagnose prisoners, and neglect of prisoners who are seriously mentally ill. The suit was dismissed.\n\n\n\n Most of these facilities only contain supermax wings or sections, with other parts of the facility under lesser security measures.\n\n\nIn Brazil, the \"\"regime disciplinar diferenciado\"\" (differentiated disciplinary regime), known by the acronym RDD, and strongly based on the Supermax standard, was created primarily to handle inmates who are considered capable of continuing to run their crime syndicate or to order criminal actions from within the prison system, when confined in normal maximum security prisons that allow contact with other inmates. Since its inception, the following prisons were prepared for the housing of RDD inmates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maximum Insecurity\", an Amazon bestseller by surgeon William Wright, M. D. gives an inside look at the medical system at the Colorado State Penitentiary.\n\nThe movie \"Escape Plan\" starring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jim Caviezel is based on an ocean-based \"supermax facility\".\n\nIn various Marvel Comics, \"The Raft\" is the name of a Supermax prison located near Ryker's Island designed to hold the most dangerous heroes and villains. It subsequently is mentioned in and appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, albeit amended to appear as a floating fully submersible prison.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864452", "title": "Dino Cazares", "text": "Dino Cazares\n\nDino Cazares, (born September 2, 1966) is an American musician, known for being a co-founder and guitarist for industrial metal group Fear Factory. He is also the co-founder of the metal bands Divine Heresy and Asesino. He also popularized the use of digital amp modelling processors for seven and eight string guitars in metal music. Cazares was a co-founding member of super-group Brujeria.\n\nCazares was born in El Centro, California on September 2, 1966. Cazares met singer Burton C. Bell in 1989 and started a group under the name Ulceration, which was renamed to their current name Fear Factory in the following year with Raymond Herrera on drums. The band's first album, \"Soul of a New Machine\", was dedicated to Cazares' mother, Natividad, and older brother, Joey. Before starting Fear Factory, Cazares was in the grindcore band Excruciating Terror, (quit after one month). Co-founded the Mexican death/grind side-project Brujeria formed in 1989 with members of Faith No More, Fear Factory, and others.\n\nWhen Fear Factory split up (temporarily) in 2002, Cazares returned to Brujeria, and released what was supposed to be the first of 13 Demoniaco Brujeria records (one for each member of Brujeria). He formed the band Asesino the same year, it featured himself with Static-X bassist Tony Campos on bass and vocals, and Emilio Marquez on drums. Fear Factory reformed later that year without Cazares. In 2005, Cazares was chosen as a team captain by Roadrunner A&R Monte Conner for the Roadrunner United album for which he wrote 4 songs and contributed with other Roadrunner Records artists.\n\nCazares formed Divine Heresy in 2005, who released their debut album \"Bleed the Fifth\" in August 2007. The band got signed to Roadrunner Records and Century Media, and included Tim Yeung (All That Remains, Hate Eternal, Nile, Vital Remains, Morbid Angel) on drums, Thomas Cummings on vocals and (later on) Joe Payne (Nile) on bass. Cummings was terminated from the band in 2008 and was replaced by Travis Neal. Their second album \"Bringer of Plagues\" was released on July 28, 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Cazares rejoined Fear Factory and has released 3 albums with them since. Divine Heresy has been inactive due to Cazares' commitment to Fear Factory and several departures that took place.\n\nCazares has voiced a minor character in the adult swim TV show \"Metalocalypse\".\n\nIn January 2019 Cazares announced his divorce from Jennifer Pagan Cazares on Twitter.\n\nOn April 7, 2009, Cazares and ex-bandmate Burton C. Bell announced the reconciliation of their friendship, and the formation of a new project with Byron Stroud (Strapping Young Lad) on bass and Gene Hoglan (Death, Strapping Young Lad, Dethklok) on drums. On April 28, this project was revealed to actually be a new version of Fear Factory, minus founding member Raymond Herrera and longtime member Christian Olde Wolbers. Bell, when asked why Herrera and Wolbers were not included, stated that \"Fear Factory's like a business and I'm just reorganizing...We won't talk about [their exclusion].\"\n\nCazares is often identified by his fast alternate picking rhythm guitar technique, timing palm muted triplets and syncopated sixteenth notes with double bass drumming. This has led to a distinctive \"machine-gun\" style identifiable in the music of Fear Factory. In previous Fear Factory albums, Cazares did not play any guitar solos in Fear Factory for stylistic reasons, but can be heard playing them in his other bands. However, the band's 2010 release, Mechanize, has several lead parts and solos.\n\nDino Cazares currently endorses Ormsby Guitars, a company based in Perth, Australia. He announced the partnership in January 2019, as well as a line of signature models, two of these being revealed at the 2019 Winter NAMM Show.\n\nCazares' main guitars in Fear Factory were previously custom-made 7-string Ibanez models with Seymour Duncan Blackouts pickups installed, usually detuned a whole step (A,D,G,C,F,A,D; from Obsolete on) to allow for even lower registers. His main guitar in Asesino is an Ibanez prototype 8-string guitar (standard tuning with two extra basses: (F#,B,E,A,D,G,B, E) loaded with 2 Seymour Duncan Blackout 8 active pickups. Before using Ibanez guitars, his main instrument was a black custom shop ESP M 6-string guitar with a single EMG 81 in the bridge, detuned to B tuning. This can be seen in the video for the song \"Replica\". His first known Ibanez 7-string is an Ibanez Universe UV7SBK \"Silver Dot\", with a modified pick guard to fit a single passive pickup and a volume knob. He was also known to have an Ibanez Universe UV777BK with similar modifications, except with an EMG 7-string prototype instead of a passive pickup.\n\nIn January 2015, Ibanez announced a signature model for Dino Cazares, the DCM100. It is based on the Ibanez RGD platform, including the 26.5\" scale, but features a mahogany body, maple neck with bubinga strip, offset dot inlays, Lo-Pro Edge tremolo, and a single Seymour Duncan Retribution pickup. This guitar makes Cazares one of only 4 Ibanez signature artists to have a signature 7-string guitar.\n\nAfter 22 years with the company, Dino Cazares announced his departure from Ibanez in January 2019.\n\nIn the early days, his guitar tone derived from a modified Marshall JCM800 head with scooped mids and high treble settings to produce the thrashy, chugging tone which has been so influential to the metal genre. After it was stolen, he switched to the Line 6 POD Pro with a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. This setup was used to record Digimortal. Currently with Fear Factory, Cazares endorsed the Line 6 Vetta II HD and POD X3 Pro processor with a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp with Mesa/Boogie oversized Rectifier 4x12 cabinets. When playing live, Cazares mostly uses the speaker cabinets for monitoring, or does not use them at all, since his signal is also run into the venue's PA. In 2011, Cazares replaced the POD X3 Pro for the most recent version, the POD HD Pro. He has also replaced his Mesa/Boogie tube power amp for a Matrix GT800FX 800W solid state power amp, and his Mesa/Boogie Rectifier 4x12 for a custom-built cabinet built by David Laboga. Sometime in 2012 or 2013, Cazares eventually switched from Line6 to Fractal Audio, making use of their Axe-FX II. This was short lived, as he would soon switch to using a Kemper Profiling Amp, an amplifier that could \"profile\" other guitar amps, allowing him to get a tone similar to previous albums.\n\nWith Divine Heresy, he used an old Marshall Valvestate VS100 head, Marshall JCM800, and a Peavey 5150 head boosted with an Ibanez TS-9.\n\nIn 2007, Cazares switched from EMG active pickups to Seymour Duncan AHB-1 Blackout active pickups, which he helped design with Duncan. In 2014, Seymour Duncan announce the Blackout Retribution pickups, which were a signature set of pickups designed with less output and more treble than a standard Blackout set.\n\nA detailed gear diagram of Dino Cazares' 2001 Fear Factory guitar rig is well-documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is affectionately referred to as 'Brindamma', by her fans.\n\nBrinda had much of her initial training from her mother Kamakshi. This training was in the Veenai Dhanammal style, a style of Carnatic Music known for its unhurried, alluring movements, as also for its use of intricate gamakas (graces) in the handling of ragas (modes). Additionally, Brinda trained for a substantial length of time under Kanchipuram Naina Pillai, whose style of music was marked by agility and robustness in laya (rhythm). After her training under Naina Pillai, Brinda learnt from her aunt Lakshmiratnam. Veenai Dhanammal, who was also Brinda's grandmother, herself taught her some compositions.\n\nShe rendered ragas that featured complex patterns and subtle gamakas, such as Begada, Mukhari, Sahana, Suruti, Varali and Yadukulakambhoji. She was a repository of Kshetrayya padams and javalis (romantic compositions rich in musical content) and many rare compositions of the Trinity of Carnatic Music and Patnam Subramania Iyer.\n\nMany talented and popular musicians were attracted by Brinda's musical scholarship and expertise, and trained under her. Carnatic Musicians such as Sangeetha Kalanidhis Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M.S. Subbulakshmi and R K Srikanthan have learnt from her. The musicians Ramnad Krishnan, Aruna Sairam, Chitravina Ravikiran, B. Krishnamoorthy, Chitravina Ganesh, K.N. Shashikiran, Kiranavali Vidyasankar, Geetha Raja and B. Balasubrahmaniyan have been Brinda's full-time students. Her grandson and direct disciple Thiruvarur S. Girish is also an accomplished Carnatic musician. In her earlier years, Brinda performed extensively with her younger sister, T. Muktha and in her later years, with her daughter Vegavahini Vijayaraghavan. Brinda did not wish to record commercially, hence only private recordings of her performances are available. Brinda was also a visiting artist at the University of Washington, Seattle from 1968–69 and 1977-78.\n\n\n"}

A push-pull configuration also helps to stabilize the double bond because the carbon-carbon bond has considerably less double bond character. For instance cyclobutadiene is a very unstable molecule but with both olefinic bonds in push-pull configuration (two ester substituents and two tertiary amine substituents) the molecule is stable indeed.\n\n\n"}

A three-part finale was serialized in \"Monthly Comic Ryū\" in 2007. A four-episode OVA adaptation by AIC tones down the explicit sexual content and deviates entirely from the manga storyline and setting.\n\nIn the near future, a secret society, Nematoda, with ambitions of world domination, hired three men, Professor Akitsu, Professor Himuro, and Professor Wakatsuki, to build the ultimate \"G-Class\" giant robot, Zeorymer. Nearly two decades later, on his deathbed, Professor Akitsu tells his son, Masaki Akitsu, that Zeorymer must not awaken. A short time later, a new student transfers into Masaki's school, named Miku Himuro. She quickly persuades him to meet her adopted father, Professor Himuro, and Masaki is curious to find out what is going on, and what his father meant in his final words. Traveling by a high-speed pod hidden under the city, he meets Professor Himuro in a vast underground facility. Nematoda's General Golshid, aware of the Himuro's appearance in Japan, send a G-Class robot to assault their base and kill them, as they believed they had the only \"Joint\". Himuro compels Masaki to pilot Zeorymer and save them, as he is the only one that can pilot it. Once he agrees, Himuro and his daughter head to an operating room without Masato's knowledge, and he installs a sphere called a \"Dimensional Joint\" - a flawed duplicate of the original - into his daughter's womb, and she is teleported to within Zeorymer's \"eye\". This is necessary to utilise Zeorymer's true abilities - without them, it is simply an outdated G-Class robot. Though Masaki stumbles with the unfamiliar systems, Zeorymer eventually awakens fully, Masaki undergoes a strange and short-lived shift in personality, and with the spherical energy weapon on the back of Zeorymer's hand, destroys its opponent in a single attack.\n\nSoon, Nematoda sends its three newest and most powerful robots after Zeorymer. Finding its pilots at school, they attempt to apprehend them, but Zeorymer is teleported to their location. Masaki's personality shifts again, and Zeorymer fights the three, despite being in the middle of a city, showing no care for civilian casualties. Zeorymer shows its power, being much faster than the fastest of the three, vastly stronger than the strongest of the three, and takes the many, many missiles of the third without damage. Finally, Zeorymer activates both of the spheres on the back of its hands and taps them together, the shockwave cleaving the final robot and several buildings behind it in two. As a result, the city has undergone immense damage, and many of its citizens are surely killed, including all of their schoolmates.\n\nWith Nematoda, General Golshid, seeing the vast power of Zeorymer, elects to pilot the powerful Rose C'est La Vie, a G-Class robot that had crippled test pilots, even at less than full power. Knowing he has little choice Golshid still elects to go, with Rose C'est La Vie at full power. Upon returning to base, Professor Himuro is shown to have collapsed and is dying of an incurable disease, and Masato realised the level of destruction fighting would cause, but strangely didn't care. Suddenly teleported to Zeorymer's cockpit, it's revealed that Masaki is the revived, evil, Professor Wakatsuki, reduced to an embryo and reborn to escape an inevitable death, Miku was Himuro's wife, who had been cheating on her husband with him, had undergone the same process as she had been caught in the same event, and that Himuro was the one to attempt to kill them. Though the three scientists were conspiring against Nematoda while they worked for the organisation, Wakatsuki was planning to betray the others and take Zeorymer for himself. Akitsu and Himuro had stolen the embryos to stop the revival, and Akitsu then took Masaki's embryo and fled from his other colleague as well. However, by activating Zeorymer, the memories and personality of Wakatsuki had been installed into Masaki, though the same was not true of Miku. Following this reveal, Wakatsuki forces himself on Miku, sexually, and uses sex to make her his.\n\nRose C'est La Vie lands and fights Zeorymer. Golshid successfully tears off one of Zeorymer's arms, but it is instantly regenerated in its entirety. He then successfully destroys its cockpit, killing Wakatsuki, to which both cockpit and pilot are regenerated completely. Defeated and nearly destroyed, Golshid is saved by the sudden loss of power of Zeorymer, as the Dimensional Joint had finally failed. With both robots retreating, Wakatsuki installs a new Dimensional Joint into Miku, and upon her awakening, suddenly shifts back to Masaki for a moment. With both Wakatsuki and Miku realising, Wakatsuki reinforces himself and flees. In the midst of coitus with Miku, Masaki comes to the realisation that the \"fake Masaki Akitsu\" was not a fake - it was not Wakatsuki's personality that was installed, just his memories. While that would be enough for a child without memories to become a \"true\" Masaki Wakatsuki, Masaki Akitsu's personality was too strong, and he eventually came to the realisation that he was simply being dragged along by how he thought he should be acting, thanks to Wakatsuki's memories, with Professor Himuro secretly watching. Deep in the base, Himura hovers over a switch, which would destroy the flawed Dimensional Joint in Miku's womb, killing both Miku and Masaki, but accepts that Masaki is not really Wakatsuki, and Miku is not his deceitful wife, feels guilt for considering Miku to only be a tool, and dies of his sickness. Upon finding him, Masaki decides that the only way to escape Zeorymer is by burying it himself, and decides to do so by attacking Nematoda's main base.\n\nArriving at Nematoda's base, Zeorymer's landing destroys many of its defending machines with the resulting shockwave, and makes short work of the remainder. Suddenly, the president of Nematoda appears, piloting a black Zeorymer, powered by the original Dimensional Fault installed into an \"inhuman\" Miku clone, revealing himself to be a second backup of Wakatsuki, but one with advanced aging thanks to the destruction left by the theft of the original Zeorymer affecting his regeneration. After the theft, he had killed the Nematoda president and taken his place. Fighting with Zeorymer and showing that they had equally powerful offensive and regeneration abilities, the two Zeorymer grappled and began to merge. Revealing that Zeorymer's power source was in another dimension, and that as a result, there can only be one Zeorymer, which was the reason that even Masaki couldn't make a perfect Dimensional Joint, despite having Wakatsuki's memories, the two machines merged into one, with the fake Miku collapsing, the original Dimensional Joint installing itself into Miku's womb, and Wakatsuki planning to take over Masaki's body in the process. Though Zeorymer is merged into a half-black, half-white version, Masaki, Miku and Wakatsuki were ejected from it. Wakatsuki fails to understand why, but Masaki enlightens him - Zeorymer reformatted its pilot registry when Masaki started piloting Zeorymer, and was installed with Wakatsuki's memories. Thus, Zeorymer couldn't install Wakatsuki's personality into Masaki's body. Wakatsuki's driven somewhat mad, reveals that he also has a self-destruct for the Joint in Miku's womb, but is shot and killed by Golshid, furious at Wakatsuki's murder of the original Nematoda president. However, there's a massive Deuterium Bomb under the Nematoda base, activated by Wakatsuki's death, which is large enough to destroy the world. However, Zeorymer is strong enough to survive. Rather than escaping, Masaki and Miku plan to absorb all the energy from the bomb's detonation into Zeorymer and into the other dimension. Golshid's expectation is that even Zeorymer will be destroyed, but Masaki says that he and Miku want to live, in this world that they grew up in. As they attempt it, Golshid is shown to have escaped in a pod. Though Masato and Miku succeed, the manga concludes by saying that no-one ever saw the G-Class Robot \"Hades\" ever again.\n\nSet in the near future, a secret feudal monarchy led by an empress and named uses, as a front, a firm 'International Electronic Brains' and has built a set of eight giant robots, each possessing a power based upon the eight elements of earth, fire, water, air, thunder, mountains, the moon and the heavens. However, one of them, Zeorymer of the Heavens, has been stolen and the main character, fifteen-year-old Masato Akitsu, is forced into piloting it with a mysterious girl named Miku Himuro.\n\nZeorymer possesses an energy based weapon called the \"Dimensional Coupler Cannon\" that appears almost telekinetic in nature; by holding its fist in the air, or aiming it at a target, energy strobes across the orb and causes a large explosion to engulf whatever enemy it is directed against. These orbs can also fire beams of golden-hued energy (labeled as the Energy Wave attack) which can cause massive damage, and project a forcefield which seems nearly impenetrable. The robot itself is also incredibly durable: in the third episode, it was struck with a weapon that left an effect similar to that of a nuclear warhead, yet suffered only minimal damage. Zeorymer of the Heavens is able to hover, fly, teleport unspecified distances, and possesses an incredibly potent weapon known as the : when it lifts its arms in the air then lowers them across its chest, slamming its fists together or against the large golden orb on its chest, the robot releases a huge blast of golden energy that, at full power, can cause an explosion visible from space (inferring the power of several gigatons at least, though even on lower settings this final weapon seems equal to most nuclear weapons in scale). When this attack is activated, a mysterious voice, possibly Zeorymer's itself, can be heard saying \"Meiou,\" the attack's name.\n\nThe first of the seven remaining Hau Dragon robots Zeorymer faces is the air-based robot known as Lanstar of the Winds, piloted by Taiha, the lover of Hau Dragon ruler Yuratei. Lanstar is smaller in build but slimmer than Zeorymer, denoting less overall protection but seeming to exhibit greater speed and agility, though they appear to be the same height. Lanstar of the Winds has a pair of huge mechanical wings on its back which seem to be the source of its powers, which are focused around creating and controlling intense air currents. To this end it can generate, at will, \"sharp\" planes of wind, tornadoes, or even release its signature \"Dead Long Fuun\" attack wherein Lanstar projects four streams of incredibly intense air currents that combine into the shape of a serpentine dragon. This intense wind blast creates a vortex of wind so powerful when it strikes a target that it was easily capable of stripping stone and earth from the ground and even causing some damage to Zeorymer's armor. \n\nThe second and third robots encountered by Zeorymer were Breist of the Fire and Gallowin of the Water. They were piloted by two identical twins, who seemed to despise one another, much like water repels fire, though it is the \"fire\" sister Shi-Aen who is more level-headed and controlled while her \"water\" sister Shi-Tau is hotheaded and untamed. Both Briest and Gallowin possessed what appeared to be several unspecified energy weapons - most of which were left unnamed - though they boasted two incredibly powerful combo attacks: Twin Lords and Twin Flare. The former had them use their primary weapons (Gallowin's twin particle beams, the Beam Searchers, and Briest's shoulder mounted Magna Flares) which are fired at one another. When they impact they result in what can only be described as a huge nuclear detonation capable of tremendous damage; next to Zeorymer's final attack it is one of the most powerful seen in the series. The latter attack, Twin Flare, is when the two robots link into one another and form twin beam cannons which, while powerful, pales in comparison to the Twin Lords attack. \n\nThe fourth Hau Dragon robot to attack was Rose C'est La Vie of the Moon, who was piloted by Ritsu, an asexual man who hid his woman-like face behind a steel mask. Rose C'est La Vie was among the most powerful single combatants ever seen in the series and was easily the most powerful Hau Dragon robot besides Zeorymer of the Heavens itself. Rose C'est La Vie was literally loaded with weapons: his chest contained four beam cannons, one beam cannon was hidden in each leg, each of its ten fingers could fire a beam of energy, and when all ten on each hand were combined they formed the Moon Beam Swords, twin energy blades powerful enough to cut through seemingly anything. Finally Rose C'est La Vie possessed a weapon which rivaled even Zeorymer's final attack, known as the J-Kaiser. Parts of Rose C'est La Vie's armor would disconnect and form a gargantuan energy cannon, and three small pods were launched into orbit. They would beam energy down to Rose C'est La Vie, which would project it out as a blast of energy from the J-Kaiser cannon so powerful it left huge craters in the ground and could even shoot a hole through mountains\n\nAfter three failed attempts to destroy Zeorymer, Yuratei finally dispatched her last three remaining robots: Omzack of the Thunder, Dinodilos of the Earth, and Burrstone of the Mountains, piloted by Saiga, Rokfel, and Giso respectively. Giso seemed to have strong feelings for Rokfel, but she seemed to have similar feelings for Saiga. Saiga was, in turn, a sociopathic man who cared for little other than proving himself the most powerful of all and boasted that his robot Omzack was the strongest Hau Dragon machine ever, which would later end ironically for him.\n\nTheir three robots were only featured briefly in the fourth and final episode and so they were not well understood, though some things were made clear: Burrstone was a heavy support robot who mounted over five hundred missiles in various launchers, ranging from normal cruise missiles and guided weapons to hugely powerful atomic bombs capable of destroying several miles of landscape, and also seemed to be incredibly well-armored with huge plates covering its entire body. Dinodilos's powers were ill-defined but it appeared have the ability to, by inserting its huge arms into the ground, control underground magma flows causing geysers of magma and huge earthquakes, and could also have limited control over earth itself. Omzack's powers, despite Saiga's boasts, are in fact never fully shown; while it handily destroyed an entire carrier group in a single massive explosion and was said to possess the \"photon lightning system\", Omzack of the Thunder proved an utter failure in battle because of Saiga's overconfidence and short sightedness.\n\nThe Hau Dragon possessed at least one other mecha - their own flying fortress - but it seemed to be rather helpless without the seven robots to defend it.\n"}

In lower speed aircraft, the effect of the wingtip shape is less apparent, with only a marginal performance difference between round, square, and Hoerner style tips The slowest speed aircraft, STOL aircraft, may use wingtips to shape airflow for controlability at low airspeeds.\n\nWing tips are also an expression of aircraft design style, so their shape may be influenced by marketing considerations as well as by aerodynamic requirements.\n\nWing tips are often used by aircraft designers to mount navigation lights, anti-collision strobe lights, landing lights, handholds, and identification markings.\n\nWing tip tanks can act as a winglet and distribute weight more evenly across the wing spar.\n\nOn fighter aircraft, they may also be fitted with hardpoints, for mounting drop tanks and weapons systems, such as missiles and electronic countermeasures. Wingtip mounted hose/drogue systems allow Aerial refueling of multiple aircraft with separation.\n\nAerobatic aircraft use wingtip mounted crosses for visual attitude reference. Wingtip mounted smoke systems and fireworks highlight rolling aerobatic maneuvers. Some airshow acts feature the pilot touching or dragging the wingtip along the ground.\n\nAircraft with a single main landing gear or very high aspect ratio wings such as gliders, may place small landing gear in the wingtips. Some uncommon designs, like the Rutan Quickie, and Convair XFY placed the main landing gear in the wingtips. Some early World War I aircraft used wooded skids on the wingtips to minimize damage on ground looping incidents.\n\nSeveral amphibious aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina, use retractable wingtips as floats.\n\nMoveable wingtips can affect the controlability of a wing. Wing warping the ends of the wing, produced roll control on the earliest of aircraft such as the Wright Flyer. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie raised and lowered its wingtips in flight to adjust its stability in supersonic and subsonic flight.\n\nWingtips can also house the power plant or thrust of an aircraft. The EWR VJ 101 used tip mounted jets, the V-22 uses tilting wingtip mounted engines, and the Harrier uses wingtip thrust for stability while hovering.\n\nRotary wing aircraft wingtips may be swept or curved to reduce noise and vibration. Some rotary wing aircraft place their propulsion in wingtip tip jets.\n\nThe Boeing 777X will feature 3.5 m (11 ft) folding wingtips supplied by Liebherr Aerospace from Lindenberg. The mechanism was demonstrated for Aviation Week at the Boeing Everett Factory in October 2016. The folding takes 20 seconds to complete.\n\n"}

Lockington became the 13th music director of the Grand Rapids Symphony in January 1999 and stepped down from the post in May 2015 at the end of his 16th season with the orchestra. Prior to his tenure in Grand Rapids, Lockington served as the music director for the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra (1996–2000) and the Long Island Philharmonic (1995–2000). In May 2007, Lockington was named music director of the Modesto Symphony Orchestra in Modesto, California. Since March 2013, Lockington has been the music director of the Pasadena Symphony in Pasadena, California.\n\nLockington was born as David Kirkman Lockington on October 11, 1956 in Dartford, Kent, UK. His father was a podiatrist and an amateur cellist. Lockington followed his father's interest in the cello and started taking cello lessons when he \"was just about 10.\" He completed his education in Great Britain at the University of Cambridge, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts degree as a choral scholar.\n\nAs a boy, Lockington sang in the English National Opera in productions such as the Magic Flute. David was principal cellist of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. At sixteen, he began his career as a cellist and was the Principal Cellist with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain for the last two years in that work.\n\nIn 1978, Lockington moved to the United States from Great Britain. He became a citizen. He came on a scholarship to Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA, where he studied cello performance and conducting. In cello performance, Lockington received a master's degree. In conducting, he studied with Otto-Werner Mueller. After graduating, Lockington served as a cellist with the New Haven Symphony Orchestra and served as assistant principal cellist with the Denver Symphony Orchestra for three years before he turned to conducting.\n\nLockington married violinist Dylana Jenson. They have four children.\n\nFrom January 1999 to May 2015, Lockington served as the Music Director of the Grand Rapids Symphony, Grand Rapids, Michigan. In his fourteen seasons as Music Director, he \"created a lasting legacy of artistic achievements and genuine community enrichment.\" \"The New York Times\" commended the Grand Rapids Symphony, under Lockington's artistic leadership for \"being a model in the Classical music world.\"\nIn May 2005, Lockington Guest Conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke’s at Carnegie Hall. He considers the Grand Rapids Symphony’s seventy-fifth anniversary trip (founded in 1930) to Carnegie Hall \"his greatest achievement.\"\n\nIn 2008, Lockington initiated the successful Grand Rapids Symphony Youth Choruses. Also, at his initiative, the Symphony reached out to new and diverse audiences through its annual community concert “Symphony with Soul.”\n\nFrom May 2007 to March 2013, in addition to his work with the Grand Rapids Symphony, Lockington held the position of Music Director with the Modesto Symphony. He traveled from Grand Rapid to California monthly \"to tend to his responsibilities there.\"\n\nIn the 2015-2016 season, Lockington was named one of three Artistic Partners with the Northwest Sinfonietta in Tacoma, Washington.\n\nDuring Lockington's tenure with the Grand Rapids Symphony, pop music was incorporated into the classical repertoire. It also began collaborating with the Grand Rapids Ballet Company. The Symphony also gained national attention for its Grammy nomination in 2007 for “Invention and Alchemy,” a DVD and CD collaboration with harpist Deborah Henson-Conant.\n\nLockington and the orchestra’s musicians encouraged a relationship with the community by \"a variety of community outreach and educational programs.\" The educational programs included \"a side-by-side concert series that allows high school students to perform with symphony members at their school.\" It also included \"an Artists in Residence partnership that allows symphony members to work with elementary school kids from kindergarten through the sixth grade.\"\n\nDuring Lockington's tenure with the Grand Rapids Symphony, either he or his Associate Conductor John Varineau conducted the Richard and Helen DeVos Classical Series, Casual Classics Series, Edward Jones Coffee Classics, Fox Motors Pops Series, Chase Picnic Pops, and DTE Energy Foundation Family Series concerts, in addition to special events, educational and festival concerts with the Grand Rapids Symphony.\n\nAlso, under Lockington's direction, the Grand Rapids Symphony reached out to the African-American community by creating a \"kind of a gospel chorus.\" The chorus was \"a mixed chorus of community people that want to come together and celebrate performing with the orchestra.” The Grand Rapids Community Gospel Chorus grew to more than one hundred voices. It performed at the annual concert “Symphony With Soul” established by Lockington in 2002 \"to help connect cultures through music.\"\n\nDuring his tenure with the Grand Rapids Symphony, Lockington took the added position of Music Director of the Modesto Symphony Orchestra in California. He traveled to California about once a month \"to tend to his responsibilities there.\" He also Guest Conducted for \"a variety of organizations around the country.\"\n\nOn January 12, 2012, Lockington was in Pasadena, California to conduct the Pasadena Symphony. Laurie Niles, editor of Violentist.com, interviewed him.\n\nAs she watched Lockington direct the youth orchestra, Laurie Niles, the reporter, described Lockington: \"There it was again: His assurance on the podium, his obvious love for the music, his ease of communication, the English accent, and his way of using words like \"penultimate\" when he speaks with kids! As in, \"Please sing the penultimate chord.\" (They looked around in puzzlement for a moment but then figured it out!). He doesn't talk down to kids.\" When one of the kids asked Lockington what were his hobbies, Lockington told about \"doing triathlons\" and a \"three-decade devotion to yoga.\" The latter stemmed from a back injury Lockington suffered in a bad car accident. \"I wanted to make sure that I could continue to move well while I aged,\" he said.\n\nLockington told Niles that \"working with students and youth can be quite helpful in the development of a conductor.\" He added that \"I personally think it's essential. There are a lot of conductors who, in their youth, get to conduct great orchestras through whatever program, or they become an assistant or an associate. But an orchestra at a high level will play itself. Learning how to pull something apart and to be very specific about what's needed, how to get it, and even to hear clearly, it's really instructive.\"\n\nFurthermore, he said that working with students and youth, \"sets up the tone of how you want to lead.\" He said, \"I like the idea of keeping everybody, not exactly guessing, but making sure that people are learning the skills of playing in orchestra: being able to go between the conductor and the page, being in the ensemble, being part of this morphing emotional entity, in time.\"\n\nIn 2012, Lockington guest conducted the Pasadena Symphony Orchestra in California. In 2013, he was appointed Music of the orchestra with an initial three-year contract. He began his tenure as Music Director immediately. His conducting work began with the 2013-14 Classics Series.

{"id": "1864505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864505", "title": "Preta", "text": "Preta\n\nPreta (, \"yi dags\"), also known as hungry ghost, is the Sanskrit name for a type of supernatural being described in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese and Vietnamese folk religion as undergoing suffering greater than that of humans, particularly an extreme level of hunger and thirst. They have their origins in Indian religions and have been adopted into East Asian religions via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as \"hungry ghost\" from the Chinese and Vietnamese adaptations. In early sources such as the \"Petavatthu\", they are much more varied. The descriptions below apply mainly in this narrower context. The development of the concept of the preta started with just thinking that it was the soul and ghost of a person once they died, but later the concept developed into a transient state between death and obtaining karmic reincarnation in accordance with the person's fate. In order to pass into the cycle of karmic reincarnation, the deceased's family must engage in a variety of rituals and offerings to guide the suffering spirit into its next life. If the family does not engage in these funerary rites, which last for one year, the soul could remain suffering as a preta for the rest of eternity.\n\nPretas are believed to have been false, corrupted, compulsive, deceitful, jealous or greedy people in a previous life. As a result of their karma, they are afflicted with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as cadavers or feces, though in more recent stories, it can be anything, however bizarre. In addition to having insatiable hunger for an aversive item, pretas are said to have disturbing visions. Pretas and human beings occupy the same physical space and while humans looking at a river would see clear water, pretas see the same river flowing with an aversive substance, common examples of such visions include pus and filth.\n\nThrough the belief and influence of Hinduism and Buddhism in much of Asia, \"preta\" figure prominently in the cultures of India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.\n\nThe Sanskrit term \"preta\" means \"departed, deceased, a dead person\", from \"pra-ita\", literally \"gone forth, departed\".\nIn Classical Sanskrit, the term refers to the spirit of any dead person, but especially before the obsequial rites are performed, \nbut also more narrowly to a ghost or evil being.\n\nThe Sanskrit term was taken up in Buddhism to describe one of six possible states of rebirth.\n\nThe Chinese term \"egui\" (), literally \"starving ghost\", is thus not a literal translation of the Sanskrit term.\n\nPretas are invisible to the human eye, but some believe they can be discerned by humans in certain mental states. They are described as human-like, but with sunken, mummified skin, narrow limbs, enormously distended bellies and long, thin necks. This appearance is a metaphor for their mental situation: they have enormous appetites, signified by their gigantic bellies, but a very limited ability to satisfy those appetites, symbolized by their slender necks.\n\nPretas are often depicted in Japanese art (particularly that from the Heian period) as emaciated human beings with bulging stomachs and inhumanly small mouths and throats. They are frequently shown licking up spilled water in temples or accompanied by demons representing their personal agony. Otherwise they may be shown as balls of smoke or fire.\n\nPretas dwell in the waste and desert places of the earth, and vary in situation according to their past karma. Some of them can eat a little, but find it very difficult to find food or drink. Others can find food and drink, but find it very difficult to swallow. Others find that the food they eat seems to burst into flames as they swallow it. Others see something edible or drinkable and desire it but it withers or dries up before their eyes. As a result, they are always hungry.\n\nIn addition to hunger, pretas suffer from immoderate heat and cold; they find that even the moon scorches them in the summer, while the sun freezes them in the winter.\n\nThe types of suffering are specified into two main types of pretas, those that live collectively, and those that travel through space. Of the former, there are three subtypes, the first being pretas who suffer from external obscurations. These pretas suffer constant hunger, thirst or temperature insensitivity. The second type of pretas are those who suffer from internal obscurations, who have small mouths and large stomachs. Often, their mouths are so small that they cannot eat enough food to fill the large space in their stomachs and thus remain constantly hungry. The last of the three subtypes are pretas that suffer from specific obscurations like creatures who live on and eat their bodies. The other broad category of pretas that travel through time and space are always scared and have a tendency to inflict pain on others.\n\nThe sufferings of the pretas often resemble those of the dwellers in hell, and the two types of being are easily confused. The simplest distinction is that beings in hell are confined to their subterranean world, while pretas are free to move about.\n\nPretas are generally seen as little more than nuisances to mortals unless their longing is directed toward something vital, such as blood. However, in some traditions, pretas try to prevent others from satisfying their own desires by means of magic, illusions, or disguises. They can also turn invisible or change their faces to frighten mortals.\n\nGenerally, however, pretas are seen as beings to be pitied. Thus, in some Buddhist monasteries, monks leave offerings of food, money, or flowers to them before meals.\n\nIn addition, there are many festivals around Asia that commemorate the importance of hungry ghosts or pretas and such festivals exist in Tibetan Buddhist tradition as well as Chinese Taoist tradition. Countries such as China, Tibet, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and Malaysia engage in hungry ghost festivals, and in China this is usually on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month according to their calendar. Many rituals involve burning symbolized material possessions, such as paper Louis Vuitton bags, thus linking the concept of the preta with the deceased's materialism in their lifetime. Though many pretas or hungry ghosts cling to their material possessions during their human lifetime, some other ghosts represented in the festivals long for their loved ones during their human life. During the festivals, people offer food to the spirits and hope for blessings from their ancestors in return. Thus, the hungry ghost festivals commemorating the pretas are a natural part of some Asian cultures and are not limited to only Hindu or Buddhist belief systems.\n\nIn Hinduism pretas are very real beings. They are a form, a body consisting only of \"vāyu\" (air) and \"akaśa\" (aether), two of the five great elements (classical elements) which constitutes a body on Earth (others being \"prithvī\" [earth], jala [water] and agni [fire]). There are other forms as per the karma or \"actions\" of previous lives where a soul takes birth in humanoid bodies with the absence of one to three elements. In Hinduism an Atma or soul/spirit is bound to take rebirth after death in a body composed of five or more elements. A soul in transient mode is pure and its existence is comparable to that of a deva (god) but in the last form of physical birth. The elements except \"akaśa\" as defined is the common constituent throughout the universe and the remaining four are common to the properties of the planets, stars and afterlife places such as the underworld. This is the reason that Pretas cannot eat or drink as the rest of the three elements are missing and no digestion or physical intake is possible for them. \n\nPretas are crucial elements of Hindu culture, and there are a variety of very specific funerary rituals that the mourning family must engage in to guide the deceased spirit into its next cycle of karmic rebirth. Rice balls, which are said to symbolize the body of the deceased, are offered from the mourning family to the preta whose spirit is often symbolized by a clay mound somewhere in the house. These rice balls are offered in three sets of 16 over one year, which is the amount of time it takes for a preta to complete its transformation into its next phase of life. The rice balls are offered to the preta because in this transient state between cremation and rebirth, the preta is said to undergo intense physical suffering. The three stages are the impure sixteen, the middle sixteen and the highest sixteen that occur over the course of the mourning period. After the physical body of the deceased is cremated, the first six rice balls are offered to ghosts in general, while the next ten are offered specifically to the preta or the spirit of the person who just died. These ten rice balls are said to help the preta form its new body which is now the length of a forearm. During the second stage, sixteen rice balls are offered to the preta, as through each stage of grief it is believed that pretas become even hungrier. At the last and final stage, the preta is said to have a new body, four rice balls are offered and five spiritual leaders of Brahmans are fed so that they can symbolize digesting the sins of the deceased during their life.\n\nWhile there are specific steps that guide the preta into its new life, during the mourning process, the deceased's family must undergo a series of restrictions to assist the preta and ease its suffering. In Indian cultures, food and digestion is symbolic as it separates the food essential for digestion from the waste products, and thus the same logic is applied to sins of the deceased in their living relatives eating and digesting the symbolic rice balls. In engaging in these rituals, the chief mourner of the deceased individual is the symbolic representation of the spirit or preta. During the period of mourning, the chief mourner can only eat one meal a day for the first eleven days following the death, and also not sleep on a bed, engage in sexual activity or any personal grooming or hygiene practices.\n\nIn general in Buddhist tradition, a preta is considered one of the five forms of existence (Gods, humans, animals, ghosts and hell beings) once a person dies and is reborn.\nIn Japan, preta is translated as \"gaki\" (, \"hungry ghost\"), a borrowing from Middle Chinese \"nga kjwɨj\" (, \"hungry ghost\").\n\nSince 657, some Japanese Buddhists have observed a special day in mid-August to remember the \"gaki\". Through such offerings and remembrances (\"segaki\"), it is believed that the hungry ghosts may be released from their torment.\n\nIn the modern Japanese language, the word \"gaki\" is often used to mean spoiled child, or brat.\n\nIn Thailand, \"pret\" () are hungry ghosts of the Buddhist tradition that have become part of the Thai folklore, but are described as being abnormally tall.\n\nIn Sri Lankan culture, like in other Asian cultures, people are reborn as \"preta\" (\"peréthaya\") if they desired too much in their life where their large stomachs can never be fulfilled because they have a small mouth.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864510", "title": "Fred Harvey Company", "text": "Fred Harvey Company\n\nThe Fred Harvey Company was the owner of the Harvey House chain of restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality industry businesses alongside railroads in the western United States. It was founded in 1876 by Fred Harvey to cater to the growing number of train passengers.\nWhen Harvey died in 1901, his family inherited 45 restaurants and 20 dining cars in 12 states. By 1968, when it was sold to Amfac, Inc., the \"Fred Harvey Company\" was the sixth largest food retailer in the United States. It left behind a lasting legacy of good food, dedication to customers, decent treatment of employees, and preservation of local traditions.\n\nThe company traces its origins to the 1876 opening of two railroad eating houses located at Wallace, Kansas, and Hugo, Colorado, on the Kansas Pacific Railway. These cafés were opened by Fred Harvey, then a freight agent for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, who emigrated to the United States from England when he was 17 years old. The café operation ended within a year, but Harvey had been convinced of the potential profits from providing a high quality food and service experience at railroad eating houses. His longtime employer, the Burlington Railroad, declined his offer of establishing a system-wide eating house operation at all railroad meal stops, but the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF) subsequently contracted with Harvey for several eating houses on an experimental basis.\n\nIn 1878, Harvey started the first of his eating house-hotel establishments along the AT&SF tracks in Florence, Kansas. The rapid growth of the Harvey House chain soon followed.\n\nFred Harvey is credited with creating the first restaurant chain in the U.S. Harvey and his company also became leaders in promoting tourism in the American Southwest in the late 19th century. The company and its employees, including the famous waitresses who came to be known as Harvey Girls, successfully brought new higher standards of both civility and dining to a region widely regarded in the era as \"the Wild West\". The popularity of the Harvey Girls grew even stronger in 1946 when Judy Garland starred in the film version of Samuel Hopkins Adams’s novel \"The Harvey Girls\".\n\nDespite the decline of passenger train patronage in the U.S. in the 20th century with the advent of the automobile, the company survived and prospered, by marketing its services to the motoring public. After 1926, Harvey Cars were used in the provision of \"Indian Detours\" services offered from a number of Harvey hotel locations. The company continued to adjust to the trends. In the late 1950s it operated, for the first 15 years, the then-new landmark Illinois Tollway \"Oases\" which were built above the Interstate 294 highway in the Chicago suburbs by Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco). \n\nThe Fred Harvey legacy was continued in the family until the death of a grandson in 1965. Portions of the \"Fred Harvey Company\" have continued to operate since 1968 as part of a larger hospitality industry conglomerate.\nBefore the inclusion of dining cars in passenger trains became common practice, a rail passenger's only option for meal service in transit was to patronize one of the roadhouses often located near the railroad's water stops. Fare typically consisted of nothing more than rancid meat, cold beans, and week-old coffee. Such poor conditions understandably discouraged many Americans from making the journey westward.\n\nThe subsequent growth and development of the \"Fred Harvey Company\" was closely related to that of AT&SF. Under the terms of an oral agreement, Harvey opened his first depot restaurant in Topeka, Kansas, in January 1876. Railroad officials and passengers alike were impressed with Fred Harvey's strict standards for high quality food and first class service. As a result, AT&SF entered into subsequent contracts with Harvey wherein he was given unlimited funds to set up a series of what were dubbed \"eating houses\" along most of the route. At more prominent locations, these eating houses evolved into hotels, many of which survive today. By the late 1880s, there was a Fred Harvey dining facility located every 100 miles along the AT&SF.\n\nAT&SF agreed to convey fresh meat and produce free-of-charge to any Harvey House via its own private line of refrigerator cars, the Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch, and in them food was shipped from every corner of the U.S. The company maintained two dairy facilities (the larger of the two was situated in Las Vegas, New Mexico) to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of fresh milk. When dining cars began to appear on trains, AT&SF contracted with the \"Fred Harvey Company\" to operate the food service on the diners, and all AT&SF advertising proclaimed \"Fred Harvey Meals All the Way\".\n\nHarvey's meals were served in sumptuous portions that provided a good value for the traveling public; for instance, pies were cut into fourths, rather than sixths, which was the industry standard at the time. The Harvey Company and AT&SF established a series of signals that allowed the dining room staff to make the necessary preparations to feed an entire train in just thirty minutes. Harvey Houses served their meals on fine China and Irish linens. Fred Harvey, a fastidious innkeeper, set high standards for efficiency and cleanliness in his establishments, personally inspecting them as often as possible. It was said that nothing escaped his notice, and he was even known to completely overturn a poorly set table. Male customers were required to wear a coat and tie in many of Harvey's dining rooms. The Harvey Houses served many a meal to GIs traveling on troop trains during World War II.\n\nThis mutually beneficial relationship, characterized as one of the most successful and influential business partnerships in the early American West, endured until 1963.\n\nFor the Southwest, Harvey hired architects Charles Whittlesey and Louis Curtiss for influential landmark hotels in Santa Fe and Gallup, New Mexico. The Grand Canyon was the Santa Fe's main tourist destination and a major activity of the Harvey Company. The rugged, landscape-integrated, and culturally appropriate design principles there influenced a generation of subsequent Western U.S. architecture through the National Park Service and Civilian Conservation Corps structures built during the Great Depression and after.\n\nThe Harvey team, with the backing of the Santa Fe, created an entire set of cultural images based on the region's distinctive, and often overlooked, artistic traditions of the Native American residents and the early Spanish settlers in the area. Especially noteworthy were the buildings on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, including lodges, souvenirs shops, and special lookout points, today on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Harvey Houses originated the \"blue-plate special\", a daily low-priced complete meal served on a blue-patterned china plate; an 1892 Harvey menu mentions them, some thirty years before the term became widespread. In addition to the AT&SF, the Harvey Company operated dining facilities for the Gulf Coast & Santa Fe, Kansas Pacific, St. Louis-San Francisco, and the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis railways.\n\nAT&SF maintained and operated a fleet of three passenger ferry boats that connected the railroad with San Francisco by water. Ships traveled the eight miles between the San Francisco Ferry Terminal and the railroad's Point Richmond terminal across the Bay. The service was originally established as a continuation of the company's named passenger train runs such as the \"Angel\" and the \"Saint\". The larger two ships, the \"San Pablo\" and the \"San Pedro\", each featured a newsstand-lunch counter located on the main deck, and a dining room on the upper deck. Meals, sandwiches, sweet rolls, pastries, and coffee were served. AT&SF discontinued ferry service in 1933 due to the effects of the Great Depression.\n\n \nIn 1883, Harvey implemented a policy of employing a female, white-only serving staff. He sought single, well-mannered, and educated American ladies, and placed ads in newspapers throughout the East Coast and Midwest for \"white, young women, 18–30 years of age, of good character, attractive and intelligent\". The girls were paid $18.50 a month, plus room and board, a generous income by the standards of the time.\n\nThe women were subjected to a strict 10 p.m. curfew, administered by a senior Harvey Girl who assumed the role and responsibilities of house mother. The official starched black and white uniform (which was designed to diminish the female physique) consisted of a skirt that hung no more than eight inches off the floor, \"Elsie\" collars, opaque black stockings, and black shoes. The hair was restrained in a net and tied with a regulation white ribbon. Makeup of any sort was absolutely prohibited, as was chewing gum while on duty. Harvey Girls (as they soon came to be known) were required to enter into a one-year employment contract, and forfeited half their base pay should they fail to complete the term of service. Marriage was the most common reason for a girl to terminate her employment.\n\nThe restrictions maintained the clean-cut reputation of the Harvey Girls, and made them even more marriageable. Cowboy philosopher Will Rogers once said, “In the early days the traveler fed on the buffalo. For doing so, the buffalo got his picture on the nickel. Well, Fred Harvey should have his picture on one side of the dime, and one of his waitresses with her arms full of delicious ham and eggs on the other side, ‘cause they have kept the West supplied with food and wives.” However, just the opportunity to leave their homes, enjoy travel, have new experiences, and work outside the home was very liberating for thousands of young women. After the Harvey Houses closed in most cities, many former Girls (and today their daughters and granddaughters) joined in appreciation to carry on their legacy.\n\nIn a mythology that has grown around the Harvey Houses and Harvey Girls, these female employees are said to have helped to \"civilize the American Southwest\". This legend found expression in \"The Harvey Girls\", a 1942 novel by Samuel Hopkins Adams and in the 1946 MGM musical film of the same name which was inspired by it.\n\nHarvey initially balked at the suggestion that in-transit dining facilities be added to all AT&SF trains operating west of Kansas City. Eventually, Harvey agreed to support the railroad in this endeavor, and the \"California Limited\" became the first AT&SF's name trains to feature Harvey Company meal service en route. Later trains, such as the vaunted \"Super Chief\", included dining cars (staffed by \"Fred Harvey Company\" personnel) as part of the standard passenger car complement right from the outset.\n\nA list of some of the 84 Fred Harvey facilities:\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, the \"Fred Harvey Company\" began expanding into other locations beyond the reach of AT&SF, and often away from rail passenger routes. Restaurants were opened in such locations as the Chicago Union Station (the largest facility operated by Harvey), San Diego Union Station, the San Francisco Bus Terminal, and the Albuquerque International Airport; the last of these was established at the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal in 1939, and could accommodate nearly 300 diners.\n\nFrom 1959 until 1975, the Fred Harvey organization operated a series of restaurants in the Illinois Tollway oasis, a set of highway rest stops built on bridges over the tollway. In 1966, Fred Harvey purchased the Furnace Creek Inn, near Death Valley National Park, from U.S. Borax in 1966 after operating it for a decade. The original \"Fred Harvey Company\", as well as the company's close affiliation with AT&SF, lasted until 1968 when it was purchased by the Amfac Corporation of Hawaii. Amfac was renamed Xanterra Parks & Resorts in 2002. In 2006, Xanterra purchased the Grand Canyon Railway and its properties.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first observed at the Crystal Lake Hatchery, Shasta County, California, and has now been reported from Idaho, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska (Bartholomew et al. 1989).\n\nIn addition to the fish host, \"C. shasta\" infects a freshwater polychaete worm (Bartholomew et al., 1997). Actinospores are released from the worm, and infect fish, on contact, in the water column. Neither horizontal (fish to fish), nor vertical (fish to egg) transmissions have been documented under laboratory conditions, suggesting that the worm host is necessary for completion of the life cycle.\n\nSpores are released back into freshwater system after its fish host dies, however the complete life cycle, host and vector interaction is not fully understood (especially the ecology of the polychaete host).\n\nResearch indicates that the potential for infection is enhanced when water temperatures are high, water flow is low, or numbers of infectious \"C. shasta\" are relatively high. Infection rates appear to be higher in or below still water environments than riverine ones.\n\nClinical indications of infection in salmons include lethargy, loss of body mass, darkening of the skin, ascites, exopthalmia and kidney pustules, These symptoms vary from one salmonid species to another, and also depend on life stage of the host.\n\nInternally, infection with \"C. shasta\" affects entire digestive tract, liver, gall bladder, spleen, gonads, kidney, heart, gills, and muscle tissues. Infection with \"C. shasta\" in adult chinook salmon causes mortality through intestinal perforations and co-occurring bacterial infections.\n\nCold temperatures and salinity may reduce progress of disease, but do not eliminate infection. Progression of infection and mortality is temperature dependent, with higher temperature increasing disease progression and resulting in quicker mortality.\n\nSalmonid stocks exhibit variable resistance to \"C. shasta\" (Bartholomew 1998). Resistance is variable and may be compromised by environmental conditions which enhance infectivity. Salmonid stocks which are resistant to \"C. shasta\" are not necessarily resistant to other myxosporean infections, such as \"Myxobolus cerebralis\".\n\n\n"}

Later, a lion escaped from its cage and terrorized the city. However, a fearless young man named Mavrud (now the name of a wine grape) confronted and slew the lion. The king summoned Mavrud's mother to learn the source of such courage. She said she had secretly saved a vine, made wine, and that this was the source of Mavrud's bravery. Khan Krum ordered the vineyards replanted.\n\nIn the original Bulgarian version the legend says it was a monster called the \"lamyata\" (ламята) which was vanquished, according to one book on wine.\n\n"}

Opened by Loew's Theatres as a movie palace in 1929 and closed in 1977, the theater sat empty for decades until a complete renovation was initiated in 2010. The theater reopened to the public on January 23, 2015 as a performing arts venue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 22, 2012.\n\nLoew's Kings Theatre was designed by the architectural firm of Rapp and Rapp. The interior decor was designed by Harold W. Rambusch. It was built and operated by the Loew's Theatres chain, and was one of the five \"Loew's Wonder Theatres\" in the New York metropolitan area. This 3,676 seat house originally presented shows that combined movies and live vaudeville. It opened September 7, 1929, with a program that included the film \"Evangeline\", a live stage show, orchestra and solo pipe organ. The film's star, Dolores del Río made a special live appearance. With the decline of vaudeville, however, the theater soon converted to showing feature films only.\n\nOn August 30, 1977, the Loew's Kings closed. Its final film was \"\". After the time of its closing, when its lavish 1929 interior was almost completely intact, the shuttered theater slowly deteriorated. Extensive physical damage was sustained to the Kings's interior as a result of decades of neglect, water damage and vandalism. The roof was belatedly repaired in 1991, and again in 2007 to halt further deterioration. It has been owned by the City of New York since 1979. After closing, the theater was subject of a film documentary, ''Memoirs of a Movie Palace''.\n\nAfter having been the object of numerous proposals for its restoration over the previous thirty years, the Kings Theatre underwent a complete renovation. The City of New York announced the plan on February 2, 2010, with a goal of returning the theatre to use as a performing arts venue. The $93 million renovation was completed in partnership with a private developer, ACE Theatrical Group of Houston, which had previously overseen major restorations of a number of historic theaters including the Boston Opera House.\n\nThe new managers, ACE Theatrical Group, spent $95 million on the renovation, including over $75,000 just on the restoration of the lobby furniture, which had been saved for four decades by the theater's old manager.\n\nThe theater's interior spaces were restored to their 1929 appearance, and its stage facilities completely rebuilt to modern standards. Restoration work in the auditorium and lobby was underway and nearing completion through late 2014. Diana Ross was the featured artist for the gala reopening performance on February 3, 2015.\n\nWhen the Loew's Kings Theatre opened it was equipped with a Robert Morton theatre pipe organ. The instrument contained 23 ranks of pipes played on an elaborately decorated four manual console, one of Robert Morton's \"Wonder Morton\" designs, installed in all the Loew's Wonder Theatres. The organ was popular with audiences and was featured in performances between film showings. The organ remained in good condition and was played one last time in 1974 prior to its being removed and donated by the Loew's company to New York City's Town Hall. The instrument was never reinstalled however, and most of its pipes and works disappeared while in storage. In 1998, the lavish console was rebuilt for use with a comparable pipe organ in a private home in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nThe Van der Molen family sent a \"Deed of Gift\" for their now 4/26 Wonder Morton to the New York Theatre Organ Society (NYTOS) on July 13, 2011. In 2013 the organ was removed from the family's home and placed in storage for an anticipated return to the restored Kings Theatre. The renovation project budget however did not provide for transport and re-installation of the organ, estimated to cost $650,000. An engineering evaluation determined that the already installed mechanical renovations took up room in the former organ lofts that the pipes would need. It was decided that an electronic organ, played through the theatre's original console, would offer the most feasible solution. In December 2014 ACE agreed to assist in the development of an electronic reproduction of the Wonder Morton. The donated pipe work would be sold or donated to a suitable venue.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

The Academy was founded in 1911 by J. L. Hamill in Bexley, Ohio and moved to its current campus in 1968. Originally an all-boys school, it became coeducational in 1991 when the Board of Trustees decided to admit girls. From its conception, the school expanded over time to a matriculation level of 1,000 students. Columbus Academy students and alumni often refer to the school as \"Academy\".\n\nIn 1911, a group of area businessmen founded the school to provide a local option for boys' secondary education. They adopted the independent country day school philosophy that academic preparation was a cooperative effort between the school and the home. \n\nColumbus Academy's first campus was situated on along Alum Creek. Numerous additions to the \"main house\" were made as the number of students in grades 5-12 grew. Academy's first headmaster, Frank P.R. Van Syckel, instituted a liberal arts program and athletic instruction.\n\nAfter continued enrollment growth and repeated flooding along Alum Creek, the Board approved a 20-year plan for relocation. The school acquired in Gahanna (eight miles northeast of Columbus), raised funds, and built a new campus. The original five-building complex served the school well until the student body exceeded 600 boys. In the mid-'70s, the school undertook a major building program that added a lower school wing and the Schoedinger Theatre. This expansion allowed Kindergarten to be added to the school in the early 1980s. In 1991, the school became a co-educational institution.\n\nThe school is situated on a secluded suburban campus. In 1999 the school built a new library reminiscent of its old Bexley campus, and added large additions to the theatre and Lower and Upper schools in 2004. Beginning in 2003, they added another addition, respectably larger than the last. This addition consisted of a new athletic building, new sports facilities and courts, additional parking lots, a new upper school wing, and a third library (totaling three libraries: one lower school, one middle school, and one upper school).\n\nIn the 2014 - 2015 school year, a ropes course and new playground was added to the Columbus Academy campus.\n\nThe Academy was one of the first schools in the US to field a soccer team and track team. Today, Academy students compete interscholastically and intramurally in football, soccer, track, baseball, basketball, tennis, golf, lacrosse, wrestling, field hockey, swimming, cross country, and other sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Edwards, she was launched 10 October 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Julia Edwards Noyes, whose great-grandfather was the uncle of Midshipman Edwards; and commissioned 24 April 1919 at Boston Navy Yard, Commander P. L. Wilson in command.\n\nIn May 1919 \"Edwards\" carried spare parts for airplanes and seaplanes to St. John's, Newfoundland, as reserves for the historic first transatlantic seaplane flight made by Navy planes. She sailed from Boston, Massachusetts 28 May to report to Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in Europe, for duty with the Food Administration. Arriving at Gibraltar in June, she took part in escorting the naval transport carrying President Woodrow Wilson into Brest, then visited England and Germany before returning to the United States on 25 August.\n\nAssigned to the Pacific Fleet, \"Edwards\" sailed from New York on 17 September 1919 and arrived at the destroyer base at San Diego, California on 13 October where she was placed in reduced commission with a partial complement 1 November 1919. In February 1920 she moved to Puget Sound Navy Yard, but returned to San Diego a year later where she remained in reserve, occasionally putting to sea for target practice. She was placed out of commission 8 June 1922.\n\nRecommissioned 18 December 1939, \"Edwards\" was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol, and after overhaul, left the west coast 22 March for Galveston, Texas. She patrolled the Gulf and east coast until fall, then sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was decommissioned 8 October 1940, and delivered to the British government as one of the destroyers exchanged for bases.\n\nCommissioned in the Royal Navy 8 October 1940 as HMS \"Buxton\" (H96) for service in the third \"Town\" Flotilla, the destroyer served in Canadian waters briefly as the U-boat war intensified; she was then allocated to 6th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, for the vital duty of keeping the supply line open to Britain. \"Buxton\" was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\"/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog. In August 1942, when newer escorts were available, she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS \"Buxton\", assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) based at Halifax. After undergoing refit in Boston from December 1942 to March 1943 she rejoined the WLEF in April, 1943. She was withdrawn from service that August and used as a static training ship at Halifax and then Digby, Nova Scotia, until the end of 1944. She was finally paid off early in 1945.\n\n\n"}

Cochran, 544 U.S. 734 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case involving libel.\n\nThe case began in California with Johnnie Cochran, the famed attorney who represented O. J. Simpson, suing his former client Ulysses Tory for libel and invasion of privacy. Cochran had withdrawn as Tory’s lawyer in a civil rights suit nearly twenty years earlier, and in the late 1990s Tory began picketing Cochran’s office, carrying signs that accused him of being a thief and of accepting bribes. A trial judge ruled that Tory had made false and defamatory statements about Cochran, and instead of awarding him damages, issued an injunction ordering Tory to never again display a sign or speak about Cochran.\n\nTory appealed, arguing that the order was a prior restraint that violated his First Amendment right to free speech. In an unpublished opinion, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the order was constitutional. The California Supreme Court declined to review the case, and on April 24, 2004, Tory filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition was granted, briefing followed and the oral argument took place on March 22, 2005. Cochran died seven days later and the court asked for further briefing.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, the court ruled 7–2 that in light of Cochran's death, the injunction limiting the demonstrations of Ulysses Tory \"amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech\".

The doctrine is grounded in the First Amendment protection of political speech, and \"upon a recognition that the antitrust laws, 'tailored as they are for the business world, are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena.'\"\n\nThe doctrine was set forth by the United States Supreme Court in \"Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.\" and \"United Mine Workers v. Pennington\". The Court later expanded on the doctrine in \"California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited\".\n\nIn \"Noerr\", the Court held that \"no violation of the [Sherman] Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws\". Similarly, the Court wrote in \"Pennington\" that \"[j]oint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition.\" Finally, in \"California Motor Transport\", the Court added that \"the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government [and] [t]he right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.\"\n\nPursuant to this doctrine, immunity extends to attempts to petition all departments of the government. And \"if . . . conduct constitutes valid petitioning, the petitioner is immune from antitrust liability whether or not the injuries are caused by the act of petitioning or are caused by government action which results from the petitioning.\" \n\nUnder the Noerr–Pennington doctrine,\"[a] party who petitions the government for redress generally is immune from antitrust liability.\" Petitioning is immune from liability even if there is an improper purpose or motive.\n\nNoerr–Pennington immunity applies to actions which might otherwise violate the Sherman Act because \"the federal antitrust laws do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from the government.\" The antitrust laws are designed for the business world and \"are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena.\" This was evident in \"Noerr\", where defendant railroads campaigned for legislation intended to ruin the trucking industry. Even though defendants employed deceptive and unethical means, the Supreme Court held that they were still immune. This is because the Sherman Act is designed to control \"business activity\" and not \"political activity.\" With this underpinning, the Court stated, \"[Because] the right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, . . . we cannot, of course, lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms.\" The antitrust laws were enacted to regulate private business and do not abrogate the right to petition.\n\nThe scope of Noerr–Pennington immunity, however, depends on the \"source, context, and nature of the competitive restraint at issue.\"\n\nSince its formulation, the doctrine has been extended to confer immunity from a variety of tort claims, including claims of unfair competition, tortious interference and abuse of process. The Ninth Circuit recently held that \"Noerr–Pennington\" also protects against RICO Act claims when a defendant has sent thousands of demand letters threatening suit.\n\nThere is a \"sham\" exception to the Noerr–Pennington doctrine which holds that using the petitioning process simply as an anticompetitive tool without legitimately seeking a positive outcome to the petitioning destroys immunity. \n\nThe Supreme Court has articulated a two-part test to determine the existence of \"sham\" litigation. First, such suits must be \"objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.\" If that threshold is met, the court will inquire whether the suit demonstrates evidence of a subjective intent to use governmental process to interfere with a competitor's business.\n\nFor example, in \"California Motor Transport v. Trucking Unlimited\", the United States Supreme Court held that the \"Noerr–Pennington\" doctrine did \"not\" apply where defendants had sought to intervene in licensing proceedings for competitors, because the intervention was not based on a good-faith effort to enforce the law, but was solely for the purpose of harassing those competitors and driving up their costs of doing business. The \"sine qua non\" of a \"sham\" proceeding is not the purpose to harm a competitor, but rather the absence of any purpose to actually obtain government action. Thus, initiating an administrative proceeding that one actually hopes to win in order to harm one's competitors is within the ambit of the \"Noerr–Pennington\" doctrine, while initiating a similar proceeding that one does not meaningfully intend to win solely to delay one's business competitors is within the sham exception.\n\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court rejected a purely subjective definition of a \"sham\" lawsuit, and set out a two-part test. Under the first prong of the test, a lawsuit fits within the \"sham\" exception to First Amendment immunity only if the lawsuit is objectively baseless in that \"no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.\" Only if the challenged litigation meets the first prong (\"objectively baseless\") may a court go on to the next prong, which consists of a determination of whether the litigant's subjective motivation in filing the objectively baseless lawsuit was an attempt to interfere with the business of a competitor.\n\n"}

The band were a somewhat unusual feature of Warp Records' 1990s roster: in contrast to the studio-oriented IDM the record label primarily dealt in, the band had a live and organic sound: a smoky mixture of dub, jazz and all tempos of breakbeat from trip hop to drum and bass.

It is commonly known as the squash bug but shares this name with certain other species.\n\nThe adult \"Anasa tristis\" is a greyish-brown, somewhat flattened insect reaching a length of about and a width of . There is often a row of alternate brown and gold spots along the margin of the abdomen. Adults survive for three or four months.\n\n\"Anasa tristis\" can be found on various members of the gourd family Cucurbitaceae, but most often occurs on pumpkins and squashes. Some varieties and cultivars are more susceptible to attack than others. Research has shown that nymphs can grow to adulthood with varying degrees of success on different host plants; 70%, 49%, 14%, 0.3% and 0% survived to maturity on pumpkin, squash, watermelon, cucumber and cantaloupe melon respectively.\n\nIn the southern part of its range, the adult female \"Anasa tristis\" lays two or three batches of about eighteen eggs, but in the northern part of the range it just lays a single batch. The eggs are oval, somewhat flattened and bronze in colour, and are deposited on the underside of the leaves of the host plant. They may be clustered close together or more widely dispersed but are often regularly arranged. The eggs hatch after seven to nine days into nymphs which have five instar stages. The first instar nymphs are green and about in length. Each successive instar is larger and less hairy and grey. The fifth instar is grey, with developing wing pads and about in length. The complete nymphal stage lasts about 33 days.\n\n\"Anasa tristis\" is a true bug that feeds by sucking sap, mainly from the leaves, but sometimes also the fruit. In the process of doing this the insects inject toxic saliva into the plant tissues which causes them to wilt, darken in colour and die. The heavier the infestation, the greater the damage to the plant. Sometimes one plant or part of a plant can be heavily attacked while surrounding plants are untouched. Besides the direct damage their feeding causes to the plant, these insects can act as vectors for cucurbit yellow vine disease caused by the bacterium \"Serratia marcescens\". This disease can kill the plants.\n"}

{"id": "1864652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864652", "title": "Homeward Bound (Turtledove novel)", "text": "Homeward Bound (Turtledove novel)\n\nHomeward Bound (2004) is a science fiction and alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove. It is the eighth and final work in his \"Worldwar series\" fictional universe. It follows the events of the Colonization trilogy and gives some closure to the storylines.\n\n\"Homeward Bound\" begins in 1972 and then flashes forward to 1977, 1982, 1984, 1994, 2012, and finally 2031, when the American starship \"Admiral Peary\" arrives at Tau Ceti and Home, the homeworld of The Race.\n\n\"Homeward Bound\" has multiple meanings in the book. It is a pun in that the Race's home planet is called Home, and many characters are headed there. For characters that are members of the Race, such as Ttomalss, Atvar, and Straha, they are headed home after the failed conquest of Earth. For Kassquit, it is her cultural home although not her biological one. The Earth ship \"Admiral Peary\" is headed to the planet Home, where they will confront the Race and try to demand respect as an independent planet or at least for the United States.\n\nAt the end of the novel, while most of the ship's crew has been in cryogenic sleep and suffered time dilation, they are given the chance to go back to Earth (their home). As the characters arrive, they handle their return as best they can.\n\nThe \"Admiral Peary\" travels at between 0.35 and 0.4 \"c\" and takes a little over 30 years, instead of 24 (the Race's starship velocities are 0.5 \"c\"), to cross the twelve light-years between Earth and Tau Ceti. The ship is named \"Admiral Peary\" for its role as a military exploration ship, after Admiral Robert Peary, who did the same in an Arctic exploration.\n\nWhen the \"Admiral Peary\" arrives in orbit around Home, the Race's planet in the Tau Ceti system, it causes a crisis in the highest levels of the Race. The Race's Emperor Risson and Fleetlord Atvar, sent back to Home with the dubious distinction of being the only Fleetlord not to conquer a planet, argue the merits and drawbacks of attempting to destroy mankind by massive nuclear strikes. Meanwhile, Researcher Ttomalss investigates reports of a major breakthrough by human scientists back on Earth.\n\nThe Race inadvertently cause itself a possible ecological disaster similar to what it caused on Earth with the Race's introduced species into the Earth's ecosystems by letting the humans' caged rats loose on Home. The rats were used for food testing for the humans.\n\nIt comes as a great shock to the Race when a second human starship, the \"Commodore Perry\", arrives in orbit around Home, having traveled the twelve light-years in just five weeks. The faster-than-light drive, which appears to be based on the principle of folding space, allows the crew to return to Earth, which is familiar but still different from how they left it. Another pun is the ship's captain, Nicole Nichols, inspired by \"Star Trek's\" Lieutenant Uhura but playing off the actress's real name. The ship is named \"Commodore Perry\" for its role in opening up the Race's empire to access the US, after Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who did the same with Japan, and the Race fears that other human nations will make their way to Home, especially a recovered Germany.\n\n\nDiplomacy is a major theme of the novel. The humans spend their time trying to convince the Race that they are not dangerous barbarians. However, that mindset of the previously-technologically-superior Race will not be dissuaded. The Americans negotiate from a position of weakness, but both sides know that it is only a matter of time until that position becomes one of greater strength.\n\nWar, a terribly destructive war in which \"millions, and probably billions\" would die on Earth, Home and possibly also on the Empire's two other worlds, is an ever-present possibility, but none of the negotiators on either side is especially warlike, and they are on quite good terms personally. The \"Admiral Peary\" orbits Home, loaded with nuclear missiles that could be launched to rain death and destruction on a world that had not known war for 100,000 years. Even The Race's imperial capital, with the Emperor in his palace, a shrine at the centre of The Race's religion as well a centre of government, might be obliterated, as the Emperor explicitly remarks in one scene. Actually using the missiles is clearly not the Americans' preferred option but is never ruled out.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives of The Race are increasingly driven to the reluctant conclusion that they must launch a war of annihilation against the humans even though they have only a very doubtful chance of winning since waiting would reduce their chance of winning to zero. However, such considerations are rendered moot by the arrival of the FTL Commodore Perry, showing the Race that time has already run out for a pre-emptive war against the \"Tosevites\".\n\nThe younger, newly-arrived Americans behave with a manifest arrogance of power not only towards The Race but even towards their own \"obsolete\" older countrymen and women of the \"Admiral Peary\". However, representatives of The Race, while embarking on a desperate struggle to catch up and achieve FTL flight for themselves, are able to devise a counterdeterrence even with their existing sub-light ships. They come up up with the idea of launching them to hit Earth at half-light speed, causing horrendous damage dwarfing that of nuclear weapons and possibly destroying Earth altogether or rendering it uninhabitable. The threat of so retaliating for a nuclear strike at Home effectively establishes an interstellar version of mutual assured destruction.\n\nStill, the situation remains fragile and precarious at the end, with not only The Race throwing their resources into the effort to achieve FTL flight but also the other human powers on Earth engaged on a similar effort. Members of The Race are especially worried about Germany, which had managed to recover from the terrible blows its war with The Race during the 1960s and, still ruled by the Nazis, would like to get revenge for that destruction. Also are the Soviet Union, which still exists in the mid-21st century and did not undergone perestroika or glasnost, and Imperial Japan, which still retains its pre-1945 nationalist and militarist ideology and never underwent a democratising US occupation.\n\nAs against such dire threats, there is the hope that FTL would open up so many new planets for colonization as to give full satisfaction to everybody's expansionist inclinations, with no need of destructive wars. This hope is voiced by Human as well as \"Lizard\" characters. However, the book ends on a deliberately ambiguous note, with both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios fully feasible in the characters' immediate future.\n\n"}
{"id": "1864657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864657", "title": "Carew Tower", "text": "Carew Tower\n\nCarew Tower is a 49-story, Art Deco building completed in 1930 in the heart of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, overlooking the Ohio River waterfront. The structure is the second-tallest building in the city, and it was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks on April 19, 1994. The tower is named after Joseph T. Carew, proprietor of the Mabley & Carew department store chain, which had previously operated on the site since 1877.\n\nThe complex contains the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza (formerly Omni Netherland Plaza), which is described as a fine example of French Art Deco architecture. The hotel's Hall of Mirrors banquet room was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nHilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nThe tower remained the city's tallest until the completion of the Great American Tower at Queen City Square on July 13, 2010, rising higher than Carew Tower. Previously, Cincinnati had been one of the last major American cities whose tallest building was constructed prior to World War II.\n\nCarew Tower was designed by the architectural firm W.W. Ahlschlager & Associates with Delano & Aldrich and developed by John J. Emery. The original concept was a development that would include a department store, a theater, an office accommodation, and a hotel to rival the Waldorf-Astoria. Emery took on as partner Col. William A. Starrett (Starrett Investment Corp.) and Starrett Brothers, Inc. as general contractors. The building is widely considered to be an early prototype of an urban mixed-use development, a \"city within a city\". New York City's Rockefeller Center, built around the same time, is a more famous example of this concept. The Hotel Emery and an office block belonging to Mabley & Carew were demolished to make the site available for construction.\n\nConstruction began in September 1929, just one month before the stock market crash on October 24 that triggered the Great Depression. Because of this, construction was continued on a modified plan. Art deco themes can be found throughout the building, particularly in the metalwork and grillwork of the elevators and lights. Locally sourced inlaid Rookwood Pottery floral tiles adorn the east and west entrances of the building. Sculpture on the exterior and interior of the building were executed by New York City architectural sculptor Rene Paul Chambellan.\n\nEighteen Louis Grell murals can be found throughout the Hilton Netherland Plaza Hotel on the bottom floor. Ten wall-to-ceiling murals can be found in the hotel's original lobby, now the Palm Court, four Greek Themed murals in the Continental Room and two above the side entry staircase are the work of muralist and painter Louis Grell. The ten murals in the Palm Court represent the recreation and it is believed that the artist representations of Carew Tower can be found worked into each background by Grell. The staircase mural says \"Welcome Travelers\" and the four in the Continental Room represent the four seasons of the year. The massive 90 foot long Apollo Gallery boost another \"Apollo on Chariot\" mural and a large \"Hunt of Diana\" mural by Grell. All murals are believed to be oil on canvas.\n\nThe total cost of the building was US$33 million, which at that time was an enormous sum of money. It took crews only 13 months to complete the construction, working 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.\n\nThrough the 1930s the Netherland Plaza Hotel was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz's National Hotel Management Company.\n\nFrom 1930 until 1960, Carew Tower was the home of the Mabley & Carew department store.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1980, Carew Tower and the neighboring PNC Tower, then called the Central Trust Bank tower, were featured in the opening and closing credits of the daytime soap opera \"The Edge of Night\", since Cincinnati was the stand-in for the show's fictional locale of Monticello. Procter & Gamble, the show's producer, is based in Cincinnati.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1982, it was also featured in the opening and closing credits on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", although the show was produced in Hollywood.\n\nThe building is home to a mixed group of tenants, including a shopping arcade, Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza, and offices. Visitors can access the observation deck located on the 49th floor. On a clear day, visitors can see for miles in all directions, and three states (Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio). Because of its architectural standards, as well as its identity with the city's heritage, Carew Tower was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994.\n\nThe building was originally designed with three towers: the tallest housing offices, the second the hotel, and the third serving as a parking garage which had an elevator rather than traditional ramps for access. The third parking tower was demolished in 1980 due to corrosion from road salt. There was also a turntable for vehicles to assist in pointing delivery trucks in the right direction. The system has since been dismantled.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864670", "title": "Marine iguana", "text": "Marine iguana\n\nThe marine iguana (\"Amblyrhynchus cristatus\"), also known as the sea iguana, saltwater iguana, or Galápagos marine iguana, is a species of iguana found only on the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) that has the ability, unique among modern lizards, to forage in the sea, making it a marine reptile. This iguana feeds almost exclusively on algae, and large males dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone. They mainly live in colonies on rocky shores where they warm after visiting the relatively cold water or intertidal zone, but can also be seen in marshes, mangrove and beaches. Large males defend territories for a short period, but smaller males have other breeding strategies. After mating, the female digs a nest hole in the soil where she lays her eggs, leaving them to hatch on their own a few months later.\n\nMarine iguanas vary in appearance between the different islands and several subspecies are recognized. Although relatively large numbers remain and it is locally abundant, this protected species is considered threatened, primarily from El Niño cycles, introduced predators and chance events like oil spills.\n\nThe marine iguana was first described in 1825 as \"Amblyrhynchus cristatus\" by Thomas Bell. He recognized several of its distinctive features, but believed that the specimen he had received was from Mexico, a locality now known to be erroneous.\n\nIts generic name, \"Amblyrhynchus\", is a combination of two Greek words, Ambly- from \"Amblus\" (ἀμβλυ) meaning \"blunt\" and \"rhynchus\" (ρυγχος) meaning \"snout\". Its specific name is the Latin word \"cristatus\" meaning \"crested,\" and refers to the low crest of spines along the animal's back.\n\n\"Amblyrhynchus\" is a monotypic genus, having only one species, \"Amblyrhynchus cristatus\".\n\nResearchers theorize that land iguanas (genus \"Conolophus\") and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor since arriving on the islands from Central or South America, presumably by rafting. The land and marine iguanas of the Galápagos form a clade, the nearest relatives of which are the \"Ctenosaura\" iguanas of Mexico and Central America. Based on a study that relied on mtDNA, the marine iguana diverged from land iguanas some 8–10 million years ago, which is older than any of the extant Galápagos islands. It has therefore traditionally been thought that the ancestral species inhabited parts of the volcanic archipelago that are now submerged. A more recent study that included both mtDNA and nDNA indicates that the two split about 4.5 million years ago, which is near the age of the oldest extant Galápagos islands (Española and San Cristóbal).\n\nThe marine iguana and Galápagos land iguana remain mutually fertile in spite of being separated by millions of years and assigned to distinct genera. They have been known to hybridize where their ranges overlap, resulting in the so-called hybrid iguana. This is very rare and has only been documented a few times on South Plaza, a tiny island where the usually separated breeding territories and seasons of the two species overlap. The hybrids have intermediate features, stay on land and are infertile.\n\nThe different marine iguana populations fall into three main clades: western islands, northeastern islands and southeastern islands. These can be further divided, each subclade generally matching marine iguanas from one or two primary island, except on San Cristóbal where there are two subclades (a northeastern and a southwestern). However, even the oldest divergence between marine iguana populations is quite recent; no more than 230,000 years and likely less than 50,000 years. On occasion one makes it to another island than its home island, resulting in hybridization between different marine iguana populations. There is one confirmed record of a marine iguana outside the Galápagos Islands; in 2014 an individual appeared on Isla de la Plata near the Ecuadorian mainland.\n\nSeven or eight subspecies of the marine iguana, listed alphabetically, have traditionally been recognized:\n\n\nIn 2017, the first comprehensive taxonomic review of the species in more than 50 years came to another result based on morphological and genetic evidence, including recognizing five new subspecies (three of these are small-island populations that were not previously assigned to any subspecies):\n\n\nEarly visitors to the Galápagos Islands considered the marine iguanas ugly and disgusting. In 1798, captain James Colnett of the British Royal Navy wrote:\n\nOn his visit to the islands in 1835, despite making extensive observations on the creatures, Charles Darwin was revolted by the animals' appearance, writing:\n\nMarine iguanas have a thickset body and relatively short, robust limbs. Adults have a row of spines extending from the nape, along the back to the tail. Males have longer spines, and larger bony plates on the top of their head than females. There are some differences in the spines depending on the island and they are most elaborate on Fernandina (subspecies \"cristatus\"). The scales on the top of the head of the marine iguana are quite conical and pointed. Although less extreme, the same can be seen in the Galápagos land iguanas (genus \"Conolophus\"), while these scales at most are slightly domed in other iguanas. Overall the skeleton of the marine iguana shows many similarities with the chuckwallas (genus \"Sauromalus\"), but this is an example of homoplasy, as the two are not closely related.\n\nMarine iguanas are not always black; the young have a lighter coloured dorsal stripe, and some adult specimens are grey. Dark tones allow the lizards to rapidly absorb heat to minimize the period of lethargy after emerging from the water. The marine iguana lacks agility on land but is a graceful swimmer. Its laterally flattened tail provides propulsion and the row of spines along the back provide stability, while its long, sharp claws allow it to hold onto rocks in strong currents. Adult males vary in colour with the season, becoming brighter when breeding. There are also major differences in the colour of the adult males depending on the subspecies. Males of the relatively small southern islands of Española, Floreana and Santa Fé (subspecies \"venustissimus\" and \"trillmichi\") are the most colourful, with bright pinkish-red and turquoise markings. In comparison, those of the relatively small northern islands of Genovesa, Marchena, Pinta, Wolf and Darwin (\"jeffreysi\", \"hayampi\", \"sielmanni\" and \"nanus\") are almost all blackish without contrasting markings. Other subspecies tend to resemble duller versions of \"venustissimus\" and \"trillmichi\", or are blackish with markings in pale yellowish, ochre, greenish or grey (sooty to near white). It is suspected that the exact algal diet of each population plays a role in their colour. Females show much less variation between the islands and are typically dark with less contrasting colours than the males. In most places, females do not change colour conspicuously between the breeding and non-breeding season, but at least on Española (subspecies \"venustissimus\") they do assume relatively bright male-like colours when nesting, which is possibly related to their need of defending the nest from other females on an island with few suitable sites.\n\nMarine iguanas typically range from in snout-to-vent length and have a tail length from . There are major geographical differences, with those of large islands generally being relatively large in adult size and those of small islands are small in size. In one study, the average snout-to-vent length on Wolf and Darwin Islands (subspecies \"jeffreysi\") was about , and those on Genovesa Island (subspecies \"nanus\") were only slightly larger. In comparison, Santa Cruz marine iguanas (\"hassi\") had an average snout-to-vent length of about , and those of Isabela and Fernandina (\"cristatus\") were only slightly smaller. Other subspecies were of intermediate size, in between the small Wolf, Darwin and Genovesa iguanas and the large Santa Cruz, Isabela and Fernandina iguanas. In another study, the largest were from western San Cristóbal Island (\"mertensi\"), followed by those from Isabela (\"cristatus\", in part), Floreana (\"venustissimus\", in part), eastern San Cristóbal (\"godzilla\"), Fernandina (\"cristatus\", in part) and Santa Cruz (\"hassi\"). The smallest by far were from Genovesa (\"nanus\"), but this study did not include any marine iguanas from Wolf and Darwin Islands. The remaining island populations were of intermediate size.\n\nThe maximum weight of adult males ranges from on southern Isabela to on Genovesa. This difference in body size of marine iguanas between islands is due to the amount of food available, which depends on sea temperature and algae growth.\n\nMarine iguanas are sexually dimorphic with adult males on average being significantly longer and weighing about twice as much as adult females. However, the largest females are only about 20–40% shorter than the largest males. There is a correlation between longevity and body size, particularly for adult males. Large body size in males is selected sexually, but can be detrimental during El Niño events when resources are scarce. This results in large males suffering higher mortality than females and smaller adult males. The mortality rates of marine iguanas are explained through the size difference between the sexes.\n\nFemale marine iguanas reach sexual maturity at the age of 3–5 years, while males reach sexual maturity at the age of 6–8 years. Sexual maturity is marked by the first steep and abrupt decline in bone growth cycle thickness. Marine iguanas can reach an age of up to 60 years, but average is 12 years or less.\n\nReproduction in the marine iguana begins during the last part of the cold and dry season, with breeding from December to March and nesting from January to April. The exact timing varies with location, depending on algae growth and the nutrient-rich Cromwell Current. It occurs earliest on islands like Fernandina, Isabela, Santa Fé and Genovesa, and latest on islands like Española. An adult marine iguana, whether male or female, will typically breed every other year, but if there is plenty of food a female may breed each year.\n\nMarine iguanas live in colonies that typically range from 20 to 500 animals, but sometimes more than 1,000. Their bodies often touch each other, but there are no social interactions like grooming, as commonly seen in social mammals and birds. However, large males defend territories for up to three months during the breeding season, and in this period they sometimes fight other males. A territory can be up to almost , but usually is less than half that size, and occasionally only . A territory often is delimited by geographic features, like boulders or crevices. The territories tend to occur in clusters with several located adjacent to each other, forming a lek, but they can occur singly. Medium-sized males roam areas near the territories of large males or walk along beaches looking for females and small \"sneaky\" males may enter the territories of large males. A male will bob his head, walk on stiff legs, raise the spiny crest along the back and open the mouth, revealing the reddish interior, to threaten another male. In most cases the suitor will turn away, but if he responds with the same behavior a fight ensues. During fights they typically do not bite each other, instead thrusting their heads together in an attempt of pushing the other away. The bony plates on the top of their heads are especially suited for interlocking. Fights between males may last for hours, and are often interrupted by periodic breaks. Once a winner has been established through the headbutting, the loser assumes a submissive position and retreats. In general fights between males are harmless and highly ritualized, but on occasion they will bite and injure each other.\n\nMales are selected by females on the basis of their body size. Females display a stronger preference for mating with bigger males. It is precisely because of body size that reproductive performance increases and \"is mediated by higher survival of larger hatchlings from larger females and increased mating success of larger males.\" Other factors involved in the female's choice of partner are the display frequency by a male (especially head-bobbing), and the quality of a male's territory, although the size of a territory does not affect his mating success. Large territorial males that frequently display also emit higher levels of certain acidic compounds (including 11-Eicosenoic acid) from their femoral pores and they may function as pheromones that enhance their chance of attracting females. Females can move freely between different territories, but when inside one they receive less harassment from the opportunistic non-territorial males. Medium-sized males attempt to mate by force and small males by stealth or force, but they have a low mating success rate compared to the large males that maintain a territory. During courtship, a territorial male nods at the female and if she accepts the male mounts her while holding her by the neck. A mating lasts no more than 20 minutes, typically 3 to 4 minutes, but it is comparatively rapid in the small \"sneaky\" males, which easily are overlooked because their size, general morphology and colours are similar to those of a female. This rapid mating is necessary because large males will chase them out of their territory as soon as they are discovered. During each breeding season, a male will mate with many females if given the chance, but the female only mates once.\n\nRoughly one month after copulation, the female lays between one and six eggs, typically two or three. The leathery white eggs measure about and weigh . This is large for an iguana, and altogether the eggs may weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female. The nest sites can be as much as inland, but typically are much closer to the coast. They are occasionally as little as inland, although they have to be above the high tide water mark. The nest is deep and dug in sand or volcanic ash by the female. On islands where there are few suitable sites and digging is difficult due to a relatively hard soil and many rocks, the female guards the nest for several days after the eggs have been buried, ensuring that they are not dug up by other nesting females. As in males defending their territory from other males, females defending their nest site from other females begin with a threat display. If this fails to scare the opponent away, the fights between females involve much biting and are less ritualized than the territorial fights between males. Where there are more suitable sites and the soil is loose, females are less likely to fight for a location and do not guard their nest after the eggs have been buried. The eggs hatch after about three to four months. The hatchlings are in snout-to-vent length, and weigh . As soon as they emerge from the nest they run for cover, and begin their trip to locations that provides optimum conditions for feeding, temperature regulation and shelter. Some hatchlings have been recorded moving as far as in two days.\n\nThe marine iguana forages almost exclusively on red and green algae in the inter- and subtidal zones. At least 10 genera of algae are regularly consumed, including the red algae \"Centroceras\", \"Gelidium\", \"Grateloupia\", \"Hypnea\", \"Polysiphonia\" and \"Pterocladiella\". In some populations the green algae \"Ulva\" dominates the diet. The algal diet varies depending on algal abundance, individual preferences, foraging behaviour, season and exact island of feeding. Some species with chemical deterrents, such as \"Bifurcaria\", \"Laurencia\" and \"Ochtodes\", are actively avoided, but otherwise algal food choice mainly depends on energy content and digestibility. On Santa Cruz Island, 4–5 red algal species are the food of choice. During neap low tides, however, the usually avoided green algae \"Ulva lobata\" is eaten more often since the preferred red algae is not easily available. Brown algae have occasionally also been recorded in their diet, but marine iguanas are unable to easily digest these and will starve if it is the only type present. A marine iguana typically eats about dry weight or fresh weight of algae per day. At Punta Espinoza on northeastern Fernandina Island it has been estimated that the almost 1,900 marine iguanas eat about 27–29 tonnes (fresh weight) of algae per year, a rate of consumption that is counterbalanced by the very high growth rate of the algae. They may feed on crustaceans, insects, and sea lion feces and afterbirth on rare occasions. The population on North Seymour Island will supplement their diet with land plants, primarily \"Batis maritima\", or other coastal succulents like \"Sesuvium portulacastrum\". These North Seymour iguanas have a higher survival rate during periods where their normal algal food is reduced. However, the hindgut of marine iguanas is specially adapted to algae feeding, likely restricting the possibility of efficiently switching to other plant types. The algae are digested with the help of endosymbiotic bacteria in their gut.\n\nIn the first months after hatching, the juveniles mainly feed on feces from larger marine iguanas, gaining the bacteria needed for digesting algae. It has been suggested that young iguanas up to about two years old are unable to swim, but studies have shown that even newly hatched marine iguanas are good swimmers; they just strongly try to avoid entering the water. At about 1–2 years old the young may voluntarily swim in shallow water and tide pools, but they do not dive.\n\nMarine iguanas can dive as deep as , and can spend up to one hour underwater. When diving to or deeper, they regularly remain submerged from 15 to more than 30 minutes. Most dives are much shorter in duration and shallower than . Individuals foraging near-shore, often less than deep, typically only spend about 3 minutes underwater. Only 5% of marine iguanas dive for algae offshore and these individuals are the large males. The minimum size of these divers vary with island and subspecies, ranging from on Genovesa Island (\"A. c. nanus\") to on Fernandina Island (\"A. c. cristatus\"). They are slow swimmers, averaging just . The highest recorded speed is only about twice that figure and this can typically only be sustained in bursts that last less than a minute. Most females and smaller males feed on exposed algae in the intertidal zone during low tide, retreating once the water returns and starts washing over them. They often scurry back-and-forth repeatedly, running to a patch of algae to take a few bites and then return fast to higher ground to avoid incoming waves. The separation in feeding behavior is advantageous because the large offshore feeding males experience less competition for food from smaller males and females. A few individuals of intermediate size may use both feeding strategies. In general, each marine iguana has a specific feeding site it returns to day after day. Most feed daily, but large offshore feeding males often only every second or third day. During bad weather with high waves marine iguanas do not feed, sometimes for more than a week. Large males often do not feed for several weeks when maintaining a breeding territory, resulting in them losing up to about one-quarter of their weight. It takes many months for them to return to their original weight. In captivity, individuals have remained strong and active even after fasting for as much as 100 days.\n\nForaging behavior changes in accordance to the seasons and foraging efficiency increases with temperature. These environmental changes and the ensuing occasional food unavailability have caused marine iguanas to evolve by acquiring efficient methods of foraging in order to maximize their energy intake and body size. During an El Niño cycle in which food diminished for two years, some were found to decrease their length by as much as 20%. When food supply returned to normal, iguana size followed suit. It is speculated that the bones of the iguana actually shorten as shrinkage of connective tissue could only account for a 10% change in length.\n\nMarine iguanas have several adaptions that aid their feeding. Their flattened tail is the primary means of propulsion in the water. When on the surface, they may use their legs for maintaining balance. Although their partially webbed feet often are mentioned, this webbing is very marginal and no greater in extent than in the green iguana, a species that also shares the flattened tail. Marine iguanas have powerful limbs with long, sharp claws for climbing, holding onto rocks and pulling themselves forward when at the sea bottom (adding to the propulsion provided by the tail). They are buoyant and float to the ocean surface if they are not actively swimming or holding on to rocks underwater. However, they have unusually compact (osteosclerose) limb bones compared to the land iguana, especially those from the front limbs, providing ballast to help with diving.\n\nOther adaptions in marine iguanas are blunt heads (\"flat noses\") and sharp teeth allowing them to easier graze algae off rocks. Together with a few \"Ctenosaurus\" species, it is the only iguana that never has more than three tips (tricuspid) on each tooth. Uniquely, the side-tips on the marine iguana's teeth are quite large, only somewhat smaller than the central tip. It also appears to replace its teeth at a higher rate than other iguanas. As a sea reptile, much salt is ingested. The salt is filtered from their blood and then excreted by specialised cranial exocrine glands at the nostrils, expelled from the body in a process much like sneezing. The marine iguana's cranium has an unusually large nasal cavity compared to other iguanas, which is necessary to accommodate the large salt glands. The head may appear white from encrusted salt.\n\nMarine iguanas have mutualistic and commensal relationships with several other animals. Lava lizards may scurry over marine iguanas when hunting flies, and Darwin's finches, mockingbirds and Sally lightfoot crabs sometimes feed on mites and ticks that they pick off their skin. Marine iguanas typically ignore these visits. When underwater, they are often cleaned by fish, like Pacific sergeant majors that pick off moulting skin. Although there are no apparent benefits to either species, marine iguanas commonly live close together with the much larger Galápagos sea lions. The two species generally ignore each other and an iguana may even crawl over the body of a sea lion.\n\nMarine iguanas are unique as they are marine reptiles that forage on inter- and subtidal algae almost exclusively. They forage in the relatively cold waters around the Galápagos Islands, which typically are between at the sea surface. As their preferred body temperature is from and the temperature declines throughout a foraging trip to the sea, sometimes by as much as , the marine iguana has several behavioral adaptations for thermoregulation. At cold temperatures their muscles are less efficient, but their relatively high temperature preference is also related to the optimal temperature for digesting the algal food in their gut.\n\nAs an ectothermic animal, the marine iguana can spend only a limited time in cold water diving for algae. Afterwards it basks in the sun to warm up. Until it can do so it is unable to move effectively, making it vulnerable to predation. However, this is counteracted by their highly aggressive nature consisting of biting and expansive bluffs when in this disadvantageous state. Their dark shade aids in heat reabsorption. In colder periods with cloudy weather and much wind, juveniles will stay in the lee of rocks, still gaining the heat from the sun. Adults may move inland to low-lying sites with less wind because of bushes and lava ridges but still exposed to direct sun. When in the water and their temperature is falling, their blood circulation is reduced because of a low heart rate of about 30 beats per minute, allowing them to better conserve their warmth. When on land and heating up, the higher heart rate of about 100 beats per minute aids in spreading the heat throughout the body. To conserve heat during the night, they often sleep closely together in groups that may number up to 50 individuals, while others sleep alone below plants or in crevices.\n\nIn general, the time of each foraging trip is directly related to the water temperature; the colder the water the shorter the foraging trip. Additionally, marine iguanas that forage in or near the intertidal zone prefer to do so during low tides, allowing them to remain on land (on rocks exposed by the tide) or return to land faster. Individuals that forage further from the shore by diving are large males, which mainly feed during the hot midday (although it may occur from late morning to early evening), are less affected by the cool water because of their body size and are more efficient swimmers.\n\nUnder the tropical sun, overheating can also be a problem. To avoid this, they pant, and adopt a posture where they face the sun and lift their body up, thereby exposing as little as possible of their body to direct sun and allowing cooling air to pass underneath.\n\nThe marine iguana has a relatively small range and is currently considered vulnerable by the IUCN. Most subpopulations have the same IUCN rating, but those of San Cristóbal, Santiago and Genovesa Islands are considered endangered.\n\nOn some shorelines they can be very numerous with densities as high as 8,000 per kilometer (almost 13,000 per mile), and may reach a higher biomass compared to the area than known from any other reptile. However, their distribution is patchy, and colonies are generally found within of the ocean, naturally limiting their range. The total population for the entire archipelago is estimated to be 200,000–300,000 individuals, although this number is labelled with considerable uncertainty. Most subpopulations have not been surveyed in detail as it is difficult to do this with a high level of accuracy because of their lifestyle and habitat. By far the largest subpopulation—likely including around of all marine iguanas—lives on Fernandina Island, but estimates vary greatly from 15,000 to 120,000 individuals. In contrast, the maximum size of the subpopulations on the islands of San Cristóbal, Darwin and Pinzon is estimated to be 400, 800 and 900, respectively. It is estimated that Marchena Island has 4,000–10,000 marine iguanas, Rabida Island has 1,000–2,000 and Santa Fé Island has 15,000–30,000. Although individuals may on occasion be transferred between islands by ocean currents, marine iguanas are unable to swim between all but the nearest islands in the archipelago because of their slow speed and limited stamina in the relatively cold water.\n\nThe periodic El Niño events reduce the cold water needed for algae to grow and this can drastically reduce the marine iguana population, on some islands with as much as 90%. Population recoveries after El Niños are fast; even when reduced by 30–50%, the population is generally able to recover within four years. However, recoveries can be partially impeded by the invasive brown algae \"Giffordia mitchelliae\". When their food algae (red and green algae) disappears during El Niños, the areas may be taken over by this brown algae, causing starvation among the marine iguanas. With global warming, it is expected that El Niño events will be stronger and occur more frequently.\n\nIntroduced predators, to which they have little or no protection, include animals such as pigs, dogs, cats and rats. Dogs may take adult marine iguanas, while the others may feed on their young or eggs. This inhibits reproduction and the long-term survival of the species. Introduced predators represent a major problem on the islands of Santa Cruz, Santiago, Isabela, Floreana and San Cristóbal where very few marine iguana hatchlings survive. Marine iguanas are ecologically naïve and have not developed efficient anti-predator strategies against the introduced species. For example, the first dogs were introduced to the Galápagos Islands more than 100 years ago, but marine iguanas have not developed an anti-predator strategy against them. In general, native predators represent a less serious threat to the marine iguana. Natural land predators include the Galápagos hawk, short-eared owl, lava gull, herons and Galápagos racer snakes that may take small marine iguanas. When swimming, marine iguanas are occasionally attacked and eaten by sharks, although the two often behave indifferently to each other, even when close together. Of the native predators, the Galápagos hawk is likely the most important, and it may also take weakened adults (not just young), but this hawk is quite rare with a total population numbering only a few hundred individuals. Marine iguanas have anti-predator strategies that reduce the impact of the Galápagos hawk, including an increased vigilance when hearing the alarm call of the Galápagos mockingbird, another species that is sometimes preyed upon by the hawk.\n\nMarine iguanas can easily be approached by humans as they are very tame and generally make little or no attempt to escape. Individuals that have been caught before are only slightly more wary when again encountering humans. Even when repeatedly caught and deliberately mishandled each time, they do not attempt to bite or lash with their tail in self-defense (although the sharp claws can cause painful scratches when the iguana attempts to gain a grip) and only move a few feet once released, allowing themselves to be caught again with ease. Pathogens introduced to the archipelago by humans pose a serious threat to this species. The marine iguana has evolved over time in an isolated environment and lacks immunity to many pathogens. As a result, the iguanas are at higher risk of contracting infections, contributing to their threatened status.\n\nChance events also present a threat, at least locally. For example, the Santa Fé population was reduced by almost as a result of the MV \"Jessica\" oil spill in 2001. Even low-level oiling may kill marine iguanas. It is suspected that the primary cause is the loss of their sensitive gut bacteria. They rely on these bacteria for digesting algae and without them the marine iguanas starve.\n\nThe marine iguana is completely protected under the laws of Ecuador, and is listed under CITES Appendix II. Almost all its land range is in the Galápagos National Park (only the 3% human-inhabited sections in the archipelago are excluded) and all its sea range is in the Galápagos Marine Reserve. Certain coastal roads have lower speed limits to reduce the risk posed by cars, especially to the young. There have been attempts of removing introduced predators from some places, but this has not been without problems. Feral dogs mostly feed on large marine iguanas, but also limit the feral cat population. When feral dogs are removed feral cats can thrive and they feed on small marine iguanas. In 2012, the last black rats were eradicated from Pinzón Island.\n\nStudies and research have been done on marine iguanas that can help and promote conservation efforts to preserve the endemic species. Monitoring levels of marine algae, both dimensionally and hormonally, is an effective way to predict the fitness of the marine iguana species. Exposure to tourism affects marine iguanas, and corticosterone levels can predict their survival during El Niño events. Corticosterone levels in species measure the stress that they face in their populations. Marine iguanas show higher stress-induced corticosterone concentrations during famine (El Niño) than feast conditions (La Niña). The levels differ between the islands, and show that survival varies throughout them during an El Niño event. The variable response of corticosterone is one indicator of the general public health of the populations of marine iguanas across the Galápagos Islands, which is a useful factor in the conservation of the species.\n\nAnother indicator of fitness is the levels of glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid release is considered beneficial in helping animals survive stressful conditions, while low glucocorticoid levels are an indicator of poor body condition. Species undergoing a large measure of stress, resulting in elevated glucocorticoid levels can cause complications such as reproduction failure. Human activity has been considered a cause of elevated levels of glucocorticoid in species. Results of a study show that marine iguanas in areas central to tourism are not chronically stressed, but do show lower stress response compared to groups undisturbed by tourism. Tourism, thus, does affect the physiology of marine iguanas. Information of glucocorticoid levels are good monitors in predicting long term consequences of human impact.\n\nAlthough marine iguanas have been kept in captivity, the specialised diet represents a challenge. They have lived for more than a decade in captivity, but have never bred under such conditions. The development of a captive breeding program (as already exists for the Galápagos land iguana) possibly is a necessity if all the island subspecies are to survive.\n\n"}

It is most commonly known as the snake plant, Saint George's sword, mother-in-law's tongue, and viper's bowstring hemp, among other names. Until 2017, it was known under the synonym Sansevieria trifasciata.\n\nIt is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping rhizome, which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from long and wide, though it can reach heights above in optimal conditions.\n\nThe specific epithet \"trifasciata\" means \"three bundles\".\n\nThe plant exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide using the crassulacean acid metabolism process, which is only present in a small number of plant species. It allows them to withstand drought. The microscopic pores on the plant's leaves, called the stomata and used to exchange gases, are only opened at night to prevent water from escaping via evaporation in the hot sun. As a result, stored oxygen is released at the opening of the stomata at night, unlike most plants which continuously exchange gases during the day.\n\nIt is a weed in some parts of northern Australia.\n\n\"Dracaena trifasciata\" is commonly called \"mother-in-law's tongue\", \"Saint George's sword\" or \"snake plant\", because of the shape and sharp margins of its leaves. It is also known as the \"viper's bowstring hemp\", because it is one of the sources for plant fibers used to make bowstrings.\n\nIt is known as \"hǔwěilán\" (虎尾兰 or 虎尾蘭, \"tiger's tail orchid\") in China; \"lengua de vaca\" (cow’s tongue) in Puerto Rico; \"tora no o\" (とらのお, \"tiger's tail\") in Japan; and \"paşa kılıcı\" (\"pasha's sword\") in Turkey. In Portugal and Brazil, it is known as \"espada de São Jorge\" (\"sword of Saint George\"). In the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium), the plant is also known as \"vrouwentong\" (women's tongue). In Russia it is known as \"тёщин язык\" (\"mother-in-law's tongue\") and \"щучий хвост\" (\"pike's tail\").\n\nLike some other members of its genus, \"D. trifasciata\" yields bowstring hemp, a strong plant fiber once used to make bowstrings.\nIt is now used predominantly as an ornamental plant, outdoors in warmer climates, and indoors as a houseplant in cooler climates. It is popular as a houseplant because it is tolerant of low light levels and irregular watering; during winter it needs only one watering every couple of months. It will rot easily if overwatered. It is commonly recommended to beginners interested in cultivating houseplants for its easy care. \n\nThe NASA Clean Air Study found \"D. trifasciata\" has potential to filter indoor air, removing 4 of the 5 main toxins involved in the effects of sick building syndrome. However, its rate of filtration is too slow for practical indoor use.\n\nIt can be propagated by cuttings or by dividing the rhizome. The first method has the disadvantage that the variegation will be lost.\n\n\"D. trifasciata\" is considered by some authorities as a potential weed in Australia, although widely used as an ornamental, in both the tropics outdoors in both pots and garden beds and as an indoor plant in temperate areas.\n\nThe plant contains saponins which are mildly toxic to dogs and cats and can lead to gastrointestinal upset if consumed.\n\nNumerous cultivars have been selected, many of them for variegated foliage with yellow or silvery-white stripes on the leaf margins. Popular cultivars include 'Compacta', 'Goldiana', 'Hahnii', 'Laurentii', 'Silbersee', and 'Silver Hahnii'. 'Hahnii' was discovered in 1939 by William W. Smith, Jr. in the Crescent Nursery Company, New Orleans, Louisiana. The 1941 patent was assigned to Sylvan Frank Hahn, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe variety \"D. trifasciata\" var. \"laurentii\", together with the cultivars 'Bantel's Sensation' \nand 'Golden Hahni' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit\n\nIn its native range in Africa, a yellow-tipped cultivar is associated with Oya, the female orisha of storms. In Nigeria it is commonly linked with Ogun, the Orisha of war, and is used in rituals to remove the evil eye. In Brazil its common name \"Espada de São Jorge\" links it to Saint George, who by syncretism is also associated with Ogun.\n"}

Toplady, a preacher in the nearby village of Blagdon, was travelling along the gorge when he was caught in a storm. Finding shelter in a gap in the gorge, he was struck by the title and scribbled down the initial lyrics.\n\nThe fissure that is believed to have sheltered Toplady () is now marked as the \"Rock of Ages\", both on the rock itself and on some maps, and is also reflected in the name of a nearby tea shop. The German translation is called \"Fels des Heils\".\n\n\"When my eyes shall close in death\" was originally written as \"When my eye-strings break in death\".\n\nThere has been speculation that, though Toplady was a Calvinist, the words, \"Be of sin the double cure, Save from wrath, and make me pure,\" suggest that he agreed with the teachings of the Methodist preacher under whom he received his religious conversion, and of his contemporary, John Wesley, who taught the \"double cure,\" in which a sinner is saved by the atonement of Jesus, and cleansed from inbred sin by the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Toplady's own published hymnal of 1776, however, contains a variant which reads: \"Be of sin the double cure, Save me from its guilt and power,\".\n\n\"Rock of Ages\" is usually sung to the hymn tune \"Toplady\" by Thomas Hastings or \"Redhead 76\", also called Petra, by Richard Redhead or \"New City Fellowship\" by James Ward. \"Toplady\" is most typical in the United States and \"Redhead 76\" in the United Kingdom, although both tunes circulate in the churches of both countries.\n<poem>\nRock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\nLet the water and the blood,\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed,\nBe of sin the double cure,\nCleanse me from its guilt and power.\n\nNot the labour of my hands\nCan fulfill Thy law's demands;\nCould my zeal no respite know,\nCould my tears forever flow,\nAll for sin could not atone;\nThou must save, and Thou alone.\n\nNothing in my hand I bring,\nSimply to Thy cross I cling;\nNaked, come to Thee for dress;\nHelpless, look to Thee for grace;\nFoul, I to the fountain fly;\nWash me, Saviour, or I die!\n\nWhile I draw this fleeting breath,\nWhen mine eyes shall close in death,\nWhen I soar to worlds unknown,\nSee Thee on Thy judgement throne,\nRock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee.\n</poem>\n\n\n\nThe hymn was a favourite of Prince Albert, who asked it to be played to him on his deathbed, as did Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart. It was also played at the funeral of William Gladstone.\n\nIn his book \"Hymns That Have Helped\", W. T. Stead reported \"when the \"SS London\" went down in the Bay of Biscay, 11 January 1866, the last thing which the last man who left the ship heard as the boat pushed off from the doomed vessel was the voices of the passengers singing \"Rock of Ages\".\n\nThe opening lines of the hymn are used in the chorus of \"Birmingham\" by the band Shovels & Rope.\n\n1980s British rock band Def Leppard were inspired by the ancient hymn's text when a member of a choir left their hymn book in their recording studio. Joe Elliott later wrote the lyrics to their song \"Rock of Ages\" after reading it and in their music video the band members dress up as monks.\n\nThis hymn tune was featured throughout the Westminster location in the game Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate. It is heard from the music boxes as well atop Buckingham Palace at the vantage point. \n\nThis hymn was regarded as one of the Great Four Anglican Hymns of the 19th century.\n\nJohannes Maas, a leader in the faith movement, commented on this hymn, \"The words of this hymn are among the most profound, inspiring, encouraging, sacred, devotional and precious words ever penned.\"\n\nIn his score for \"Altered States\", John Corigliano made reference to this hymn many times, to symbolise the religious struggle of the hero and the memories of his anti-religious father, which figures in one of his hallucinations.\n\nA large rounded stalagtite in Carlsbad Caverns is named \"Rock of Ages.\" Rangers leading tours would stop there, turn out the lights, and lead the group in singing the hymn.\n\nThe hymn has appeared in other languages including German (as \"Fels der Ewigkeit\") and Swedish (\"Klippa, du som brast för mig\").\n\nThere were also Latin translations by William Gladstone as \"Jesus, pro me perforatus\" and by Canadian linguist Silas Tertius Rand as \"Rupes saeculorum, te.\" On reading this version, Gladstone wrote to Rand, \"I at once admit that your version is more exact than mine\".\n\nThis hymn was also translated to Tamil, a south Indian language spoken by nearly by 120 million people. The hymn is included in \"Christhu Sabai Paamalai\", the hymnal of the Church of South India (CSI) headquartered in Chennai. It is titled \"Pilavunda malaye\" and is hymn number 350. \n\nThis hymn was also translated to Telugu, a south Indian language spoken by nearly eighty million people.

In English, his name is sometimes spelled as Iustin Popovich.\n\nPopović was born to Spiridon (a sexton) and Anastasija Popović, in the southern Serbian town of Vranje, the day before the Feast of Annunciation (by the Julian Calendar), on 6 April 1894. At his baptism, he was given the name Blagoje, after the Feast of the Annunciation (Blagovest means Annunciation or Good News). He was born into a priestly family, as seven previous generations (not including his father Spiridon) of the Popovićs (Popović in Serbian actually means \"family or a son of a priest\") were headed by priests.\n\nHe completed the nine-year studies at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Theology in 1914. In the early 20th century the School of St. Sava in Belgrade was renowned throughout the Orthodox world as a holy place of extreme asceticism as well as of a high quality of scholarship. Some of the well-known professors were the rector, Fr. Domentian; Professor Fr. Dositheus, later a bishop; Athanas Popović; and the ecclesiastical composer, Stevan Mokranjac. Still, one professor stood head and shoulders above the rest: the then hieromonk Nikolaj Velimirović, professor of philosophy and theology, the single most influential person in his life.\n\nDuring the early part of World War I, in autumn of 1914, Blagoje served as a student nurse primarily in Shkodër, Niš and throughout Kosovo. Unfortunately, while in this capacity, he contracted typhus during the winter of 1914 and had to spend over a month in a hospital in Niš. On 8 January 1915, he resumed his duties sharing the destiny of the Serbian army from Peć to Skadar(during which one hundred thousand Serbian soldiers died). On January 1, 1916 he entered the monastic order in the Orthodox cathedral of Shkodër and took the name of St. Justin, after the great Christian philosopher and martyr for Christ, St. Justin the Philosopher.\n\nShortly after becoming a monk, Justin, along with several other students traveled to Petrograd, Russia for a year-long study in the Orthodox Seminary there. It was here the young monk Justin first dedicated himself more fully to Orthodoxy and the monastic way of life. He learned of the great Russian ascetics: St. Anthony and Theodosius of the Caves in Kiev, St. Seraphim of Sarov, St. Sergius of Radonezh, St. John of Kronstadt and others.\n\nAfter his year's study and sojourn in Russia, Justin Popović entered the Theological School in Oxford, England at the prompting of his spiritual father Nikolaj. Justin studied theology in London in the period 1916-1926, but his doctoral thesis under the title \"Filozofija i religija F. M. Dostojevskog\" (\"The Philosophy and Religion of Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky\") was not accepted due to its radical criticism of Western humanism, rationalism, Roman Catholicism, and anthropocentrism. It was subsequently printed in 1923 when Popović became the editor of the Orthodox journal \"The Christian Life\". Together with his colleagues from the Oxford University he edited the periodical \"The Christian Life\" for twenty years. \n\nIn 1926 he was promoted to the title of the Doctor of Theology at the Faculty of Theology, University in Athens (his dissertation being \"Problem ličnosti i saznanja po Sv. Makariju Egipatskom\" -\"The Problem of Personality and Cognition According to St. Macarius of Egypt\"). For his course on the \"Lives of the Saints\", Justin began to translate into Serbian the \"Lives of the Saints\" from the Greek, Syriac and Slavonic sources, as well as numerous minor works of the Fathers-homilies of John Chrysostom, Macarius, and Isaac the Syrian. He also wrote \"The Theory of Knowledge According to St. Isaac\". \n\nFrom 1930 until 1932 after a short period as Professor in the Theological Academy of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Prizren, he was an associate of Bishop Joseph (Cvijovich) of Bitola and the man tasked with reorganizing the Church of the Carpatho-Russians in Czechoslovakia. This area had seen an increase in those espousing Uniatism, where previously converted Christians of these regions started their conversion back into the Orthodox religion. \n\nFate brought Nikolaj Velimirović, John Maximovich of Shanghai and San Francisco and Popović together in Bitola. The young Maximovich (a Russian of Serbian ancestry) was the assistant to Fr. Justin at the theological seminary there, while the Bishop of Ohrid was Nikolaj Velimirović.\n\nPopović was chosen, in 1934, as Professor of Dogmatics at the Theological Faculty of St. Sava in Belgrade. As the professor at the University of Belgrade he was one of the founders (1938) of the Serbian Philosophical Society along with a number of noted Belgrade intellectuals, including Branislav Petronijević, Toma Živanović (1884–1971), Miloš Đurić (1892–1967), Prvoš Slankamenac, Vladimir Dvorniković, Jelisaveta Branković, Zagorka Mićić, Kajica Milanov, Nikola Popović and others.\n\nHe was also the professor of Dogmatics at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology of the University of Belgrade from 1934 until 1945, until World War II. In 1945, with the establishment of the communist state and state atheism, Father Justin's anti-communism and efforts to convert others to Christianity had little place.\n\nAfter World War II, Popović was considered ineligible by the Communist party to continue as a professor at the seminary. Together with a few fellow professors, he was ousted from the Faculty in 1945. Popović spent 31 years in the Ćelije Monastery under the continuous surveillance of the Communist Party police. The Communists limited his public appearances within monastic confines. While Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović was never allowed to return to Serbia and Yugoslavia after his deportation in the Dachau concentration camp, Popović was allowed to actively participate in the organization of the Serbian Orthodox Church. This is perhaps because unlike Velimirović, Popović was not a bishop but a hieromonk. \n\nA devoted monk and philosopher of the Eastern Orthodox theology, Justin Popović was a great critic of \"ecumenism, providing it was inclined towards relativization of God's Truth\". (John Meyendorff, professor of the Academy of St. Vladimir now in Scarsdale, New York (associated with Columbia University) - and every bit as much a critic of the \"Catholic novelties\" and the Pope's anti-Christianity. Until the end of his life Father Justin was a dedicated creator, and it is no wonder that his work is considered as \"a great contribution to the Orthodox theology\" and he himself as \"the secret conscience of the Serbian Church and the entire martyr's Orthodox religion\" (according to John N. Karmiris, the Greek academician).His example has been invoked by the Church of Greece (in the strict sense)'s Synod banning prayers with members of other Christian denominations.\n\nFr. Justin died the day after his birthday, 7 April 1979, on the day of the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25 by the Julian Calendar).\n\n\n"}

After growing up in the farm belt during the Great Depression, he envisioned the market for rental vehicles for families who wished to avoid the expense of professional transfer and storage companies and move themselves around the country.\n\nShoen (pronounced \"shown\") was born on February 29, 1916 in McGrath, Minnesota to Sophie (née Appert) and Samuel J. Shoen. His father moved the family to Oregon in 1923 to farm in the Willamette Valley near Shedd. His father was ethnically Scottish and English; his mother was of Swiss and French descent.\n\nShoen worked his way through Oregon State College by running a chain of beauty parlors and barber shops in Corvallis and nearby Albany, and later at Camp Adair north of Corvallis and at the Hanford Reservation in Washington. Sam earned a B.Sc. in General Science (a pre-med degree) from OSC in 1943, and entered the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland. Shoen was suspended from medical school during his fourth year after he \"called out present during a roll-call for an absent classmate\", and never returned.\n\nShoen served in the U.S. Navy as a Hospital Apprentice First Class in Bayview, Idaho and Seattle, and was given a medical discharge in 1945 for rheumatic fever. After starting the U-Haul Company, Shoen earned an LL.B. at the Northwestern College of Law, later known as the Lewis & Clark Law School, in Portland in 1955.\n\nShoen began his career as a barber.\n\nIn 1945, at the age of 29, Shoen co-founded U-Haul with his wife, Anna Mary Carty (1922-1957), in Ridgefield, Washington, just north of Vancouver. Anna Mary was the mother of Shoen's first six children. The company was started with an investment of $5,000. In the early years, the Shoens routinely worked 16-hour days, and reinvested all their earnings back into the business. He began building rental trailers at the Carty Ranch in Ridgefield, owned by his parents-in-law, and splitting the fees for their use with gas station owners whom he franchised as agents. The first U-Haul Rental Agent was a Mobil station on Interstate St. in Portland. These early deals were based on little more than a wink and a nod. He developed one-way rentals and enlisted investors as partners in each trailer as methods of growth. In 1951, Shoen reorganized the U-Haul Trailer Rental Company under a new holding company, ARCOA (Associated Rental Companies of America) Inc.\n\nBy 1955, there were more than 10,000 U-Haul trailers on the road and the brand was nationally known. The corporate offices were in Portland, until a 1967 relocation to Phoenix, Arizona. While distracted to some extent by growing his business, Shoen also managed multiple marriages after the death of his first wife from a congenital heart defect, and eventually had a total of 12 children, each of whom he made a stockholder. Shoen married Suzanne Gilbaugh in 1958, and they had five more children. Shoen divorced Gilbaugh, and married Suzanne Whitmore in 1978 to have one last child. Some observers say that Shoen saw it as his duty to confer upon his children the fruits of his labors, others say it was to avoid taxes. In either case, he had transferred all but 2% of control to his children when 2 of them, Joe and Mark launched a successful takeover of the business in 1986.\n\nIn the 1960s, Shoen diversified his holdings by creating Amerco Inc., from Advanced Management Engineering and Research Company. He pronounced the acronym, \"a miracle.\"\n\nShoen resided in Las Vegas, Nevada. He died on October 4, 1999, at the age of 83, when he crashed his car into a telephone pole near his Las Vegas Valley, Nevada home in what was ruled by the Clark County Coroner's office as a suicide. Shoen was survived by his fifth wife, Carol, and all his children.\n\n"}

Sloane (October 1, 1909 – August 6, 1965) was an American character actor who worked in radio, theatre, films and television. He was also a songwriter and theatre director.\n\nSloane was born in Manhattan October 1, 1909, to Nathaniel I. Sloane and Rose (Gerstein) Sloane. At age seven he played Puck in a play at Manhattan's Public School 46 and decided to become an actor. He completed two years at the University of Pennsylvania, and left in 1927 to join Jasper Deeter's Hedgerow Theatre repertory company. He made his New York stage debut in 1928. Sloane took a Wall Street job as a stockbroker's runner, but when his salary was cut in half after the stock market crash of 1929 he began to supplement his income with radio work. He became the sleuth's assistant on WOR's \"Impossible Detective Mysteries\", played the title character's sidekick, Denny, in \"Bulldog Drummond\" and went on to perform in thousands of radio programs.\n\nSloane married Lillian (Luba) Herman, an actress on stage and radio, January 4, 1933, in Manhattan.\n\nSloane made his Broadway debut in 1935, playing Rosetti the agent in George Abbott's hit comedy, \"Boy Meets Girl\".\n\nSloane was a member of the repertory company that presented the radio news dramatization series \"The March of Time\". \"It was like a stock company, whose members were the aristocrats of this relatively new profession of radio acting,\" wrote fellow actor Joseph Julian. At that time Julian had to content himself with being an indistinguishable voice in crowd scenes, envying this \"hallowed circle\" that included Sloane, Kenny Delmar, Arlene Francis, Gary Merrill, Agnes Moorehead, Jeanette Nolan, Paul Stewart, Orson Welles, Richard Widmark, Art Carney, Ray Collins, Pedro de Cordoba, Ted de Corsia, Juano Hernandez, Nancy Kelly, John McIntire, Jack Smart and Dwight Weist. \"The March of Time\" was one of radio's most popular shows.\n\nSloane's radio work led him to be hired by Orson Welles to become part of his Mercury Theatre. Sloane recorded one program with \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and became a regular player when the show was picked up by a sponsor and became \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Sloane moved with the rest of the company to Los Angeles to continue recording the show after Welles signed his contract with RKO Pictures. Sloane played Mr. Bernstein in Welles's first movie, \"Citizen Kane\". After filming had wrapped, Sloane returned to New York to perform (together with fellow \"Kane\" stars Ray Collins and Paul Stewart) in Mercury Theatre's last play, Richard Wright's \"Native Son\", which had 114 performances from March to June 1941. Although he did not appear in Welles's second film, \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", in 1943 he joined fellow Mercury Theatre alumni Welles, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, and Ruth Warrick in \"Journey into Fear\". In 1947, Sloane also starred as lawyer Arthur Bannister in \"The Lady from Shanghai\", produced and directed by Welles. He played an assassin in Renaissance-era Italy opposite Welles' Cesare Borgia in \"Prince of Foxes\" (1949).\nSloane portrayed a doctor for paraplegic World War II veterans in 1950's \"The Men\" with Marlon Brando (in his film debut).\n\nSloane's Broadway theater career ended in 1960 with \"From A to Z\", a revue for which he wrote several songs. In between, he acted in plays such as \"Native Son\" (1941), \"A Bell for Adano\" (1944), and \"Room Service\" (1953), and directed the melodrama \"The Dancer\" (1946).\n\nIn the 1940s, Sloane was a frequent guest star on the radio theater series \"Inner Sanctum Mystery\" and \"The Shadow\" (as comic relief Shrevie, the cab driver, among other roles), and was in \"The Mysterious Traveler\" episode \"Survival of the Fittest\" with Kermit Murdock. Sloane co-starred with Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie in Universal's 1951 \"The Prince Who Was a Thief\" as a thief who adopts a baby and raises it as his own. In 1953, he starred as Captain Frank Kennelly in the CBS radio crime drama \"21st Precinct\". In 1957, he co-starred in the ninth episode of \"Suspicion\" co-starring Audie Murphy and Jack Warden. In 1958, he played Walter Brennan's role in a remake of \"To Have and Have Not\" called \"The Gun Runners\".\n\nSloane also worked extensively on television. In 1950, for example, he portrayed Vincent van Gogh in The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse's production \"The Life of Vincent Van Gogh.\" Later, in November 1955, he starred in the \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" episode \"Our Cook's a Treasure\". He appeared on the NBC anthology series \"The Joseph Cotten Show,\" also known as \"On Trial\", in the 1956 episode \"Law Is for the Lovers\", with co-star Inger Stevens.\n\nOn March 7, 1959, he guest-starred in an episode of NBC's \"Cimarron City\" titled \"The Ratman\", appearing alongside the show's star, John Smith. Later that same year, Sloane appeared as a guest in \"Stage Stop\", the premiere episode of John Smith's second NBC western series, \"Laramie\".\nIn 1961, Sloane appeared in an episode of \"The Asphalt Jungle\". In the early 1960s, he voiced the title character of \"The Dick Tracy Show\" in 130 cartoons. Beginning in 1964, he provided character voices for the animated TV series \"Jonny Quest\". He also starred in the ABC sci-fi television series \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\", in the episode \"Hot Line\". He wrote the unused lyrics to \"The Fishin' Hole\", the theme song for \"The Andy Griffith Show\". Sloane guest starred on the show in 1962, playing Jubal Foster in the episode \"The Keeper of the Flame\". He starred in both the film and television versions of Rod Serling's \"Patterns\", and in the first season of \"The Twilight Zone\" in the episode \"The Fever\" (S1, Ep.17; Airdate: Jan. 29, 1960). He guest starred as a San Francisco attorney in the 1962 \"Perry Mason\" episode \"The Case of the Poison Pen Pal\".\n\nSloane appeared in Walt Disney's \"Zorro\" series in 1957–1958 as Andres Felipe Basilio, in the \"Man from Spain\" episodes. He also appeared in a few episodes of \"Bonanza\" and an episode in Rawhide.\n\nSloane performed renditions of passages from \"The Great Gatsby\" on the NBC program devoted to F. Scott Fitzgerald in August 1955, part of the \"Biography in Sound\" series on great American authors.\n\nSloane committed suicide by barbiturate overdose at age 55 on August 6, 1965, apparently because he feared he was going blind as a result of glaucoma. He is buried at Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

The opening is an offshoot of the normally staid Four Knights Game and is defined by the moves:\n\nThe theoretician Oskar Cordel reported in 1888 that Leipzig club players used the opening to dangerous effect, but he did not believe it was . Their name for it, \"Gambit Müller und Schulze\", was not after any players by those names, but rather a jocular German equivalent of \"Smith and Jones\", or, \"Tom, Dick, and Harry\". The modern name \"Halloween Gambit\" was given by the German player Steffen Jakob, who explained that \"Many players are shocked, the way they would be frightened by a Halloween mask, when they are mentally prepared for a boring Four Knight's, and then they are faced with Nxe5.\"\n\nWhite's objective is to seize the with pawns and drive back Black's knights. After 4... Nxe5, White usually plays 5. d4 (5.f4 does nothing for his ), after which Black can retreat the attacked knight to either g6 or c6.\n\nWhen Black retreats 5...Ng6, White chases the f6-knight with 6.e5. Then after 6...Ng8 7.Bc4, former world champion Max Euwe recommended 7...d5 8.Bxd5 c6, contending in volume 11 of his opening series that Black has a decisive advantage.\n\nInstead of holding on to the extra piece with the usual 6...Ng8, a more logical continuation according to Eric Schiller is 6...Bb4, giving Black the better game after 7.exf6 Qxf6 with a lead in development and pressure in the center. \nWhen Black retreats 5...Nc6, White chases the knight again with 6.d5. Then Black has 6...Ne5 (the Main line), or 6...Bb4 (Pinski's move).\n\nAfter 6...Ne5, White chases again with 7.f4. Then after 7...Ng6 the game usually continues 8.e5 Ng8 9.d6 cxd6 10.exd6 (see diagram). In this case White's attack is very dangerous, and likely to prevail in practical play, with the threat of Nb5–c7 difficult to defend satisfactorily. Precise defense may theoretically preserve Black's advantage but White has achieved his opening objectives.\n\nGM Larry Kaufman wrote in 2004 that the Müller–Schulze Gambit is by 4...Nxe5 5.d4 Nc6 6.d5 Bb4 7.dxc6 Nxe4 8.Qd4 Qe7, which he attributes to the Polish IM Jan Pinski. In 2003 Pinski analyzed 9.Qxg7 Nxc3+ 10.Be3 Nd5+ 11.c3 Rf8 12.cxb4 Nxe3 13.fxe3 Qxb4+, concluding \"Black is very close to winning\". White may also continue with the less risky 9.Be3.\nA similar gambit can be tried by Black: after 4.g3, Black can play 4...Nxe4 This line is arguably sounder than its White counterpart because White's 4.g3 has weakened the f3-square. Moreover, White cannot play the line recommended by Kaufman with colors reversed, because 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Nc3 d4 7.Bb5 dxc3 8.Nxe5? Qd5 9.Qe2? loses to 9...Qxh1+. However, with the pawn on g3, Nh4 is possible and it should be easier to castle.\n\nThe following speed chess games (played by Brause, a chess computer) show what can befall an unprepared player of the black pieces:\n\n\nThe next game, played in a Halloween Gambit thematic tournament, won the prize for the most spectacular game won by White.\n\n\n"}

The merchant is shunned by the rich but the poor attend him in droves, and learn that the pearl is kept at the home city of the merchant, \"Nine Gates\", rather than being carried on him.

Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with Indian nationalism (swadeshi) and led by Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like E. B. Havell, the principal of the Government College of Art, Kolkata from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the modern Indian painting.\n\nThe Bengal school arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the academic art styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Raja Ravi Varma and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havell attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore, a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \"materialism\" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, \"Bharat Mata\" (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a pan-Asianist model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were Nandalal Bose, M.A.R Chughtai, Sunayani Devi (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), Manishi Dey, Mukul Dey, Kalipada Ghoshal, Asit Kumar Haldar, Sudhir Khastgir, Kshitindranath Majumdar, Sughra Rababi, .\n\nThe Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of modernist ideas in the 1920s. , there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.. \n\nBimal Sil' was a contemporary of Abanindernath Tagore. He painted in water colours. His paintings are found in private collections only.\n\nBengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art & Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Amit Sarkar, Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan and Ratan Acharya. \nSome of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are Jogen Chowdhury, Mrinal Kanti Das, Gopal Sanyal, Ganesh Pyne, Manishi Dey, Shanu Lahiri, Ganesh Haloi Jahar Dasgupta, Samir Aich, Bikash Bhattacharjee, Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and Devajyoti Ray.\nSanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.\n\nR. Siva Kumar, who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.\n\nHis ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition .\n\n\n\n"}

He was a veteran of the War of 1812, and a member of the Whig Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as U.S. Senator from Delaware.\n\nNaudain was born at Snowland or Naudain's Landing, near Leipsic, Kent County, Delaware. He graduated from the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, in 1806. He then studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, graduated in 1810, and began practicing medicine in the Dover area. During the War of 1812 he served as surgeon general of the Delaware Militia.\n\nHis brother, Elias Naudain, was justice of the peace in Leipsic, in Little Creek Hundred during the 1820s. He served in the lower house of the Delaware General Assembly in 1827 and in that same year was commissioned first major of the Fourth Regiment of the Delaware Militia. In 1832 he was elected a delegate to the convention to revise the Delaware Constitution and was later was elected to the Delaware Senate.\n\nThey were sons of Andrew Naudain and Rebecca Snow. Their father farmed and operated a store at Naudain's Landing. Rebecca Snow was from near Leipsic, Delaware and her ancestors came to Delaware in 1635. She inherited the near Leipsic that became known as Snowland or Naudain's Landing, and she and Andrew lived there and are buried there.\n\nNaudain's grandparents were Arnold Naudain and Catharine Allfree. The older Arnold owned a large amount of land, was a member of the legislature in 1763, and was said to have been \"a man of very large stature.\" Naudain's great grandparents were Elias Naudain and Lydia LeRoux. They married in Philadelphia in 1715. He was a mariner, in Delaware by 1717, and described himself as a resident of Appoquinimink Hundred and sometimes as of St. Georges Hundred. In 1735 he acquired farmland known as the \"old Naudain homestead,\" which was located near Taylor's Bridge in Appoquinimink Hundred, and which, except for the period 1816-1827, remained in his descendants' hands into the 20th Century.\n\nElias was the son of another Elias Naudain and Jahel Arnaud. They were both native to La Tremblade, Santonge, France and were naturalized in London in 1682. Jahel Arnaud came to America with her four children about 1686, probably within a year after the death of her first husband, and was one of the first colonists of Narragansett. She married Jacob Ratier there and moved to New York City when the Narragansett Colony disbanded in 1691. She is believed to have lived with her son, Elias, in Delaware after Jacob died in late 1702 and to have died there in 1720 or 1721.\n\nArnold Naudain, the subject of this article, married Mary M. Schee in 1810. She was the daughter of Hermanus Schee and Mary Naudain. According to Ruth Bennett in the\" Naudain Family of Delaware,\" Mary Schee Naudain is described as \"an accomplished and religious woman, a devoted and loving wife and mother. She died in 1860.\n\nTheir eight children included \"James S. Naudain M.D.\" who married Ann Elizabeth Blackiston, both dying young, \"Andrew S. Naudain\" who studied law in the office of John M. Clayton but diverted his efforts to managing the Mt. Airy Plantation while his father served in the U.S. Senate and then went into the leather business in Philadelphia, \"Rebecca A. Naudain\" who married Hugh Alexander and lived in Chicago, and \"Mary H. Naudain\" who married William N. Hamilton M.D, who had attended school in Dublin, London and Jefferson College in Philadelphia. Practicing medicine first in New Castle, Delaware, in 1839 he moved his practice to Odessa. In the early 1850s he was resident physician at Fort Delaware, was a sergeant in the First Delaware Regiment and in the Fifth Delaware Cavalry. He was also Delaware state auditor and a Republican. Other children were \"Elizabeth R. Naudain\" who married James E. Ellis M.D. from West Chester, New York and \"Catherine L. Naudain\" who married a prominent printer of Harrisburg, Adam B. Hamilton, and \"Lydia Frazier Naudain\" who married Clayton A. Cowgill M.D., a surgeon in the Civil War, who in 1867 moved to Florida, where he bought a plantation on the St. John River at Orange Mills. He served as Florida state comptroller after Lydia died.\n\nNaudain established a practice at Cantwell's Bridge, now Odessa, before age 21 and gave medical service in the War of 1812 as surgeon of the Delaware Regiment. While carrying out his medical practice, Naudain was elected to the State House and served there in the 1817 and 1818 sessions and again in the 1826 session, when served with his brother, Elias Naudain from Kent County. Arnold was elected Speaker. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1822, 1824 and 1828, losing each time to Louis McLean. In 1828 he was appointed Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He lost again running for Governor of Delaware in 1832 against Democrat Caleb P. Bennett.\n\nFilling the vacancy left by the resignation of Louis McLane, he was elected by the Delaware General Assembly on January 7, 1830 to the United States Senate and served from his election until he resigned on June 16, 1836. During the 24th Congress he was the Chairman of the Committee on Claims. Naudain was an anti-Jacksonian when first elected, and became associated with the Whigs as that party formed.\n\nNaudain served as a member of the board of trustees at Newark College, later the University of Delaware, from 1833 to 1835. An active Presbyterian layman, Naudain proposed that the University decline the proceeds of a state lottery due to the opposition of his church. As a result, the state threatened to ask the college to return proceeds purchased from the college's endowment, since they had been financed by an earlier lottery. However the board of trustees voted 13-0 against rejecting the lottery proceeds. Naudain was one of seven trustees who refused to vote and subsequently resigned his position on the board.\n\nFeeling his private business suffering, Naudain resigned from the U.S. Senate and resumed the practice of medicine in Wilmington. From 1841 until 1845 he was appointed to the position of Collector of the port and superintendent of Light Houses on the Delaware River. That year he moved to Philadelphia and continued his medical practice there, returning to Delaware in 1857. He was a Freemason, serving at one time as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Delaware.\n\nNaudain died on January 4, 1872, two days shy of his 82nd birthday. He is buried in the Old Drawyer's Presbyterian Churchyard at Odessa, Delaware. He was described as \"a most courteous gentleman, commanding in person, handsome in feature, and neat in attire; and evenly balanced in temperament; an humble, sincere Christian, a delightful companion, as winsome and interesting in old age as in the hey-day of youth.\"\n\nElections were held the first Tuesday of October. Members of the General Assembly took office on the first Tuesday of January. State Representatives had a one-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who took office March 4 for a six-year term. In this case he was initially completing the existing term, the vacancy caused by the resignation of Louis McLane. However, the General Assembly failed to fill the position for nearly a year.\n\n\n"}

He was the Archbishop of Perth from 1981 to 2005 and Primate of the Anglican Church of Australia from 2000 until May 2004. He ordained the first women priests in Australia. In the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours list, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia. He is married to Ann Carnley.\n\nCarnley was born in New Lambton, New South Wales. He studied in Australia at Trinity College, Melbourne and in England at Emmanuel College and St John's College, Cambridge, and became warden of St John's College at the University of Queensland, as well as lecturer in theology at the University of Queensland, before becoming a bishop. As a lecturer in the 1970s he experimented with Process Theology. He holds many honorary doctorates and a Lambeth DD (2012) and is an honorary fellow of Trinity College (Melbourne), Emmanuel College (Cambridge) and St John's College (Cambridge).\n\nCarnley was consecrated a bishop on 26 May 1981 at St George's Cathedral, Perth and installed there as Archbishop of Perth and Metropolitan of Western Australia in the same service. In the 1980s he supported the ordination of women and, on 7 March 1992, he ordained the first women priests in the Anglican Church of Australia at St George's Cathedral, Perth. His sermon on the occasion took as its reference an autobiographical piece by Charlotte Perkins Gilman entitled \"The Yellow Wallpaper\". Carnley used Gilman's account of the self-destruction consequent on a \"benignly prescribed, submissive, middle-class role\" demanded of women in the 19th century to consider the \"implications of the philosophy that women should \"stay in their place, maintaining silence, concealing problems and repressing creativity\". The yellow wallpaper of the title is what the imprisoned protagonist in Gilman's story peels off the walls as she goes mad. Carnley used it as a metaphor for the situation of the women who had been waiting to be allowed to become priests, saying: \"Today, we are peeling away the sickly yellow, faded, silverfish-ridden wallpaper with which the church has surrounded itself and imprisoned women for centuries past in its benign and perhaps well-meaning determination to confine them by role.\"\n\nFrom 2004 he served as co-chair of the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC II) seeking greater unity between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. He served as Distinguished Visiting Professor in systematic theology at the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York City for from 2010 to 2013.\n\nIn 2001, amid questions about the possibility of the church celebrating same-sex marriages, Carnley suggested that the church might be able to bless gay \"friendships\". Later, Carnley acknowledged that the consecration of American Bishop Gene Robinson created controversy in the church, but predicted that the church would not be irreparably split over the issue.\n\nIn \"The structure of resurrection belief\" Carnley outlines several different ways Christians frame their belief in the resurrection of Christ and the way the resurrection frames their faith. He explores notions of the resurrection as an historical event, as an eschatological event and as a non-event. He also explores the role of memory, presence and faith in believing in the resurrection.\n\nWhen Carnley became the Australian primate, his views caused controversy with some, especially in the conservative Diocese of Sydney, where Archbishop Harry Goodhew accused Carnley of breaching church doctrine and betraying the church's belief in the significance of the resurrection and of Jesus Christ himself. Others, including Phillip Jensen, Rector of St Matthias, Centennial Park in Sydney, objected to comments about how the Christian belief in the uniqueness of Christ had been misused to persecute people of other faiths. Some church leaders, especially within the Diocese of Sydney, called for a boycott of Carnley's installation as Primate, but Archbishop Goodhew rejected such calls, which he said would be tantamount to severing relations with the rest of the church.\n\nCarnley says he believes in the uniqueness of Christ: \"I think Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life, but that doesn't mean that other religions don't have any truth at all.\"\n\nHe also says he has an Easter (or resurrection) faith in the real presence of the living Jesus:\n\"The Christian story, which pre-eminently transmits and celebrates the memory of Jesus and God’s revelatory deed in and through his life and death, should lead us beyond itself to a living encounter with the real presence of all that it celebrates and rehearses: him, whom by story we recall, we actually know as the living Spirit of the fellowship of faith.\" He also asserted that the resurrection is \"the miracle of the Christian tradition\".\n\nand a contributor to:\n\n\n"}

The group formed in Pittsburgh's South Oakland neighborhood in 1999 as an informal side project of Dean Swagger, a rock trio that had spent the previous year mainly performing in basements to college party crowds. The original lineup consisted of guitarist Phil Boyd and drummer Paul Quattrone, then nominally students at the University of Pittsburgh. The group made its first appearances at the Halloween weekend in 1999 and played a live set on WPTS 92.1 FM, the University of Pittsburgh college radio station, segments of which later turned up on the group's demo album, \"House on the Hill\" (and, subsequently, its 2002 self-titled release).\n\nBy 2000, the duo had gained a reputation around Pittsburgh for its concerts. \"Modey Lemon\", the group's debut album, appeared in early 2002, and the band supported the album with tours of the US and Europe. The group followed their self-titled release with a brief stint on In the Red Records, which released a double 7 inch record, before recommending the band to Birdman Records owner Dave Katznelson, who then signed the band. Prior to the mid-2003 release of second album \"Thunder + Lightning\", Boyd and Quattrone added Jason Kirker on guitar and Moog synthesizer. Following the US release of \"Thunder + Lighting\" the band signed with Mute Records, which licensed and released the album in the UK and Europe, and via EMI (Mute's parent label) in Japan. The single releases, \"Crows\" (2004, #75) and \"Sleepwalkers\" (2005, #71), each appeared in the UK Singles Chart for one week.\n\nTheir third album \"The Curious City\" was released in August 2005 on Birdman/Mute. \n\nModey Lemon has performed with The White Stripes, The Von Bondies (2002 UK tour), Girl Talk, the Blues Explosion, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Oneida (2005 Europe tour), The Warlocks (2003 UK Tour), Icarus Line (2004 UK tour), Dinosaur Jr. (2005 tour dates in UK/Europe/US), Arctic Monkeys (2009 US tour), and has played festivals such as Glastonbury (2005), ArthurFest (2005), Meredith Music Festival (2003), and Transmusicales (2004).\n\nIn 2006, the band appeared in a 'punk club' scene in the film adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel \"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh\", performing two original songs written for the film as well as two cover songs.\n\nThe band released their fourth album \"Season of Sweets\" on May 12, 2008. The band also completed a tour of the US in June and July that year and a tour of the UK and mainland Europe in September.\n\nIn August 2009 the band supported the Arctic Monkeys in New York City, Boston, and Chicago. \n\nIn October 2009, it was announced that their track \"Become a Monk\" from the band's album \"Season of Sweets\", would be included on the soundtrack of the video game, \"\".\n\nIn 2010 Modey Lemon recorded and released one single \"Wandering Eye b/w Cheetahs for Chariots\" on These Are Not Records and performed once at the University of Pittsburgh's William Pitt Union in spring 2010 before going on indefinite hiatus. \n\nIn 2015, Modey Lemon's first two albums \"House on the Hill\" and Modey Lemon (album) were reissued on vinyl for the first time on A-F Records, Mind Cure Records, and Omentum Records. \n\n\nThe members of Modey Lemon remained active musically after their last performance as a group in spring 2010. \n\nBoyd and Quattrone formed Shockwave Riderz in 2012 with singer Sara Mac. Boyd played drums and sang while Quattrone operated an MPC sampler and effects pedals. The band released 3 singles \"Riderz USA 2013\" (self-released), \"Mountaintop Rock\" (Volcomm Entertrainment), and \"Punisher/Dearest\" (Velocity of Sound). Shockwave Riderz toured the USA with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and !!! in 2013 and again with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in 2014 before disbanding. \n\nQuattrone was active in numerous bands within Pittsburgh in the 2000s. He also was a member of !!! (Chk Chk Chk) for several years before relocating to Los Angeles where he joined Thee Oh Sees and also formed Warm Drag.\n\nBoyd and Kirker formed the rock quartet Old Head in 2012 with Pittsburgh comic book artist and musician Bill Wehmann and musician Mike Layton. The band released the self-titled album \"Old Head\" in 2015 on Omentum Records. Kirker currently lives in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nBoyd has released several solo albums under the name Hidden Twin since 2006. He also performed with the electronic duo TM Eye from 2010-2012 with Pittsburgh producer/musician and operator of Machine Age Studios, Preslav Lefterov. TM Eye released one mix tape \"Ecolectro Mix\" (Deer Skull Records) and two singles \"Deepwater Horizon/Sundown\" (Cass Records) and \"Exposure/Pollution\" (Machine Age Records).

It is made of the milk of goats, sheep, or cows, or a mixture of these. It is slightly crumbly, with at least 46–48% of dry matter containing 44–48% of fat. It is commonly produced in blocks, and has a slightly grainy texture. It is used as a table cheese, in salads, and in baking.\n\nSirene, together with yogurt, is a national food of all the countries in the Balkans, with many national and regional variations. \n\nTraditional dishes using sirene are:\n\nSoups: Potato or vegetable soup with sirene (сиренява чорба). \n\nSalads: Shopska salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, onions and sirene. Ovcharska salad (\"shepherd's salad\") with the above-mentioned vegetables, cheese, ham, boiled eggs and olives. Tomatoes with sirene is a traditional light salad during the summer.\n\nEggs: Fried eggs and omelettes with sirene. There is also a popular kind of boiled eggs over mashed sirene with a sauce of yogurt, garlic, parsley and walnuts (яйца по панагюрски; eggs à la Panagyurishte).\n\nPasta and cornmeal: For breakfast, macaroni or flat noodles (Bulgarian: \"юфка, yufka\") with sirene and sugar are popular. Kachamak (the local variant of cornmeal, polenta or the Romanian mămăligă) is always eaten with sirene.\n\nPastry: The traditional banitsa and other kinds of pastry are also made with sirene.\n\nStuffed peppers are more often stuffed with rice, but are also made with sirene-and-eggs filling.\n\nAlso it is consumed as an appetizer.\n\nMany Balkan and other cheeses are similar to (but not the same as) sirene, and are known by various names. The local consumers of each country are usually well-aware of the differences between the various white cheeses. Part of the differences are that the breeds of sheep and goats in each region are different, and their feed may have specific regional characteristics that affect the taste and texture of cheese made from their milk.\n\n\n"}

Much of Burke's analysis focuses on Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" (\"my struggle\"). Burke (1939; reprinted in 1941 and 1981) identified four tropes as specific to Hitler's rhetoric: inborn dignity, projection device, symbolic rebirth, and commercial use. Several other tropes are discussed in the essay, \"Persuasion\" (Burke: 1969).\n\nOne trope is the idea of the common enemy. Without an enemy with a mindless determination to destroy everything good and beautiful, any state struggles with the economic and social problems of unemployment and poverty. So, the idea of a common enemy is a symbol of the evil against which people must unite, and it distracts the people from politically inconvenient issues by relating all evils to the common rhetorical enemy. According to Burke, this is creating an antithesis. We are born separate individuals and divided by class or other criteria, so identification is a compensation to division. (Burke, 1969, p. 22). He sees this human need to identify with or belong to a group as providing a rich resource for those interested in joining us or, more importantly, persuading us. To promote social cohesion, antithesis makes a simple balancing statement, \"\"We\" do this\" but \"\"They\" do that\". This symmetry creates an expression of conjoined opposites which stigmatises the latter and encourages the former to cohere by only doing \"this\". At first, the enemy may be local politicians or other voices that might criticise the protagonist's actions. Then, all opposing voices are seen as antithetical to unity: without a united voice, the outside enemies will gain the upper hand. If the nation goes to war, fascism requires that everybody in society and every aspect of society is involved in the war effort and machine, so the society fights as one organism under the one leader.\n\n\"All roads lead to Rome.\" In Ancient Rome, this was literally and metaphorically true. All roads did radiate out from the capital of the Empire and all tribute and authority was owed to the Emperors. This is a form of cognitive mapping which associates inspiring ideology and strong leadership with a particular location. Hence, Hitler promoted Munich as the place where all roads must leadgeography materializing the ideology of fascism.\n\nThe unification rhetoric demands a unifying voice: the entire nation must speak as one person. This is the essence of the authoritarian ideal and it produces a totalitarian, one party state.\n\nProjection devices are scapegoating tactics used to personalise the initially vague threats posed by the common enemy. At a social level, the internal problems of unemployment and poor trading performances are directly attributed to the activities of the \"identified others\". Simplification is a particularly effective rhetorical device when dealing with an uncritical population, permitting rhetoricians to rise to power through their persuasive abilities, frequently outmanoeuvering those with expert knowledge who do not communicate well. In this context, Burke (1941) identified Hitler's use of apodictic argumentation where anecdotal experiences are asserted as proof of his social analysis.\n\nIt is usual to define a national ideal or archetype, or class of citizen as a measuring stick by which all other types of people are to be judged. This archetype will be heroic, noble, and dignified to appeal to the vanity in the majority, while the others will be subhuman and easily distinguished by reference to their ethnicity, religion or politics. For this rhetoric to be effective, it must always address existing prejudices. Hitler proposed the Manichean antithesis of superior: inferior through the superiority of \"das Volk\", i.e. the Aryan race, over the inferior races (\"in particular Jews and Negroes\").\n\nWink and others identify symbolic rebirth rhetoric as allowing a people to aspire towards a new utopian society; when the scapegoat is eliminated, a rebirth will occur. The morally negative action of elimination is justified by a positive goal of symbolic rebirth, where all ideals are realised. It will only occur once in the lifetime.\n\nAnother trope is Commercial use. Commercial use rhetoric offers a non-economic interpretation of economic problems that appeals to the class that will benefit the most if the competition is removed. Thus, Burke (1941) identifies Hitler's attribution of Germany's economic difficulties to \"Jewish\" moneylenders, suggesting that if they were removed, \"Aryan\" finance would be in control.\n\nThe following journal articles reference \"The Rhetoric of Hitler's \"Battle\"\":\n\n"}

These bases are typically populated by squadrons, groups or wings, their various support commands, and other tenant commands.\n\nThe term \"Naval Air Station\" is used by many countries' navies, such as the United States Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Navy, and the Indian Navy.\n\nIn the case of the U.S. Navy, similar facilities in the U.S. Marine Corps are known as Marine Corps Air Stations and facilities in the U.S. Coast Guard are known as Coast Guard Air Stations.\n\nThe Argentine Naval Aviation operates four \"Base Aeronaval\" (BAN): from BAN Punta Indio (BAPI) in Buenos Aires Province through BAN Comandante Espora (BACE) and BAN Almirante Zar (BAAZ) in Patagonia to BAN Almirante Quijada (BARD) at Tierra del Fuego. Runways also serve domestic airlines at almost all Argentine military air bases. The Navy operates \"Estacion Aeronaval\" (EAN) (stations) which have smaller crews and are not normally assigned aircraft. These include Ezeiza, Rio Gallegos and Ushuaia.\n\nThe Argentine Naval Prefecture, serving as the Coast Guard, also operates air stations at Posadas, Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata, and Comodoro Rivadavia. Aircraft operating out of these bases are heavily involved in air/sea rescues.\n\nIn Australia, there is one Naval Air Station, \"NAS Nowra\", HMAS \"Albatross\", and the formal Naval Aircraft Repair Yard and apprentice training establishment at HMAS \"Nirimba\" in Schofields, Sydney.\n\nIn 2017, the French Naval Aviation has four naval air stations (BAN), all located in metropolitan territory.\nThe BAN Tontouta was reassigned the French Air Force ; the BAN Nîmes-Garons (and not Nimes-Garron, as indicated by error on the map) is now assigned primarily to the civil aviation (air transport) and on a secondary basis to the Ministry of Interior for Civil Security.\n\nThe United Kingdom has two Royal Naval Air Stations (RNAS), RNAS Yeovilton (HMS \"Heron\") and RNAS Culdrose (HMS \"Seahawk\").\n\nUntil 2006, the former served as the main operating base for the Royal Navy's Sea Harriers, which were based upon the three \"Invincible\" class aircraft carriers. However, upon the withdrawal of the BAe Sea Harrier in that year, no strike aircraft have operated from there. It is believed that all of their successors will be based at RAF Lossiemouth. The site also contains the Fleet Air Arm Museum, that showcases a variety of aircraft from the Royal Naval Air Service (1914–1918) until the present day. RNAS Yeovilton also has RNAS Merryfield as its training and satellite station.\n\nRNAS Culdrose serves a variety of helicopter and fixed-wing squadrons, such as the Sea King and the Jetstream respectively. Among the features at RNAS Culdrose is the \"Dummy deck\" which is used to train pilots to land on ships, the Merlin training facility, and the Fleet Requirements Air Direction Unit. Its satellite airfield is RNAS Predannack.\n\nThe Italy has three Marina Militare NAS: MARISTAELI Catania, MARISTAELI La Spezia Luni and MARISTAER Grottaglie.\n\nIn the United States, a \"Naval Air Station\" (NAS) is an air base of the United States Navy. When located in foreign countries, they are more specifically named \"US Naval Air Stations\" (USNAS), to avoid confusion with naval air stations used by the navies of the host countries.\n\nA slightly lower level of air base in the U.S. Navy is the Naval Air Facility. These facilities normally support smaller numbers of naval aircraft. Permanently based naval aircraft are usually minimal, with the principal focus being on supporting naval aircraft deployed from other installations. Examples are NAF Atsugi, Japan; NAF Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory; NAF El Centro, California; NAF Washington at Andrews AFB, Maryland; NAF Souda Bay, Crete; NAF Misawa at the U.S. Air Force's Misawa AB in Japan; and NAF Mildenhall at the U.S. Air Force's RAF Mildenhall installation in the United Kingdom. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions have resulted in closure of Naval Air Facilities such as NAF Detroit at Selfridge ANGB, Michigan; NAF Lajes at the U.S. Air Force's Lajes AB facility in the Azores; NAF Kadena at the U.S. Air Force's Kadena AB, Japan; NAF Adak, Alaska; and NAF Midway northwest of Hawaii.\n\nThere are also a number of former Naval Air Stations that have been realigned as part of larger Naval Stations (NAVSTA) or redesignated to other functions in the Navy. This includes the former NAS Norfolk, Virginia (now part of NAVSTA Norfolk), the former NAF Mayport, Florida (now part of NAVSTA Mayport), the former NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (now part of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base); and the former NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey (redesignated as Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst). In the case of NAS Memphis, Tennessee (redesignated as Naval Support Activity Mid-South), the airfield and flight line was turned over to local civilian authorities, while the Navy retained the remainder of the installation.\n\nThere are also larger facilities that are similar to Naval Air Stations and possess large airfield facilities, but were actually constructed as part of much larger facilities or were dedicated to research and development activities. This includes NAVSTA Rota, Spain; the recently closed NAVSTA Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; the still active Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, California; and the recently closed Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Navy also operates a number of austere unmanned or minimally manned airfields known as Naval Auxiliary Landing Fields (NALF), Naval Outlying Landing Fields (NOLF), or more simply Outlying Fields (OLF).\n\nIn the United States, a \"Marine Corps Air Station\" is an air base of the United States Marine Corps. When located in foreign countries, they are often identified as \"US Marine Corps Air Stations\" (USMCAS), following their US Navy counterparts (the Marine Corps falling as a service under the Department of the Navy) as that term is used by the navies of other countries.\n\nAs part of Naval Aviation, Marine Corps Air Stations and Marine Corps Air Facilities fill a similar role as Naval Air Stations and Naval Air Facilities for the United States Marine Corps. Marine aviation units are also assigned on occasion as permanently based units to Naval Air Stations, Naval Air Facilities and, in rare cases, to Air Force Bases and Air National Guard Bases as well.\n\nLike the Navy, the Marine Corps also operates a number of austere unmanned or minimally manned airfields known as Marine Corps Auxiliary Landing Fields (MCALF), Marine Corps Outlying Landing Fields (MCOLF), or more simply Outlying Fields (OLF). Since the Marines' flight training is combined with the Navy and the Coast Guard, those fields dedicated to training of student aviators in the southeastern United States remain under Navy control. As a result, the Marine Corps' auxiliary fields support operational Fleet Marine Force (FMF) units for readiness purposes, such as field carrier landing practice (FCLP) for fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft embarking on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard is also part of U.S. Naval Aviation and operates its own Coast Guard Air Stations and Coast Guard Air Facilities, either as stand alone installations on joint civil-military airports or Coast Guard-controlled facilities, or collocated at Naval Air Stations, Air Force Bases, Air National Guard Bases and Army Air Fields. Since the Coast Guard has no aviation facilities located in foreign countries, the service tends not use the term \"U.S. Coast Guard Air Station\" (USCGAS), but will use the term Coast Guard Air Station (CGAS) or more simply, \"AIRSTA.\" The Coast Guard also operates a number of smaller Coast Guard Air Facilities, most of which are limited to rotary-wing operations only and support a limited number of aircraft and personnel.\n\n"}

An alternate version exists, known as the Passion of Peter and Paul (Passio sanctorum Petri et Pauli), with variances in the introductory part of the text. Some versions have been written by a certain Marcellus, thus the anonymous author, of whom nothing further is known and is sometimes referred to as pseudo-Marcellus. The intended Marcellus is doubtless he who after the martyrdom takes the lead in burying St. Peter \"near the Naumachia in the place called the Vatican.\"\n\nThe text is framed as the tale of Paul's journey from the island of Gaudomeleta to Rome, where it also claims that on the way the ship also lands in Melita. It assigns Peter as Paul's brother. It also describes the death of Paul by beheading, an early church tradition.\n\nThe text often includes a letter purporting to be from Pilate, known as Acts of Pilate (or \"Epistle of Pontius Pilate\").\n\nThe \"Passio\", which appears in numerous medieval manuscripts, was known to Jacobus de Voragine who noted in his \"vita\" of the Apostle Peter, \"His martyrdom wrote Marcellus, Linus pope, Hegesippus, and Leo the pope.\" There are two Old English analogues, Ælfric's \"Passio Apostolorum Petri et Pauli\" and the anonymous Blickling Homily 15, \"Spel Be Petrus & Paulus.\"\n\nThe work appears to have been based on the Acts of Peter, with the addition of Paul's presence where before it was only Peter's. The work is dated to around 450 to 550. Latin as well as Greek versions survive, with the latter usually being longer. The Latin versions sometimes end with \"I, Marcellus, have written what I saw.\" This Marcellus is identified as a disciple of Simon Magus, who lived in the 1st century. Because of this obvious anachronism, since the text is clearly written centuries later, scholars have dubbed him Pseudo-Marcellus.\n\n\n"}

The influence of Radiohead was apparent in \"All Roads To Fault\" and \"Ignoto\", where Mullen often sang about technological and mechanical failure, conveying a sense of bewilderment and confusion.

The Daun noble family originated from the Rhineland and derived its name from the ancestral seat at Daun south of the High Eifel range.\n\nHe was intended for the church, but his natural inclination for the army, in which his father and grandfather had been distinguished generals, proved irresistible. In 1718 he served in the War of the Quadruple Alliance in Sicily, in his father's regiment. He had already risen to the rank of \"Oberst\" (Colonel) when he saw further active service in Italy and on the Rhine in the War of the Polish Succession (1734–35). He continued to add to his distinctions in the Turkish War of 1737–39, in which he attained the rank of \"Feldmarschallleutnant\" (Major-General).\n\nIn the War of the Austrian Succession from 1740, Daun distinguished himself by the careful leadership which was afterwards his greatest military quality.\n\nIn Austria's First Silesian War against Prussia, he was present at Chotusitz and Prague, and led the advanced guard of Khevenhüller's army in the victorious Danube campaign of 1743. Field Marshal Count Traun, who succeeded Khevenhüller in 1744, thought equally highly of Daun, and entrusted him with the rearguard of the Austrian army when it escaped from the French to attack Frederick the Great. He held important commands in the battles of Hohenfriedberg and Soor, and in the same year (1745) was promoted to the rank of \"Feldzeugmeister\" (Lieutenant General). After this he served in the Low Countries, and was present at the Battle of Val. He was highly valued by Maria Theresa, who made him commandant of Vienna and a Knight of the Golden Fleece, and in 1754 he was elevated to the rank of \"Feldmarschall\" (Field-Marshal).\n\nDuring the interval of peace that preceded the Seven Years' War he was engaged in carrying out an elaborate scheme for the reorganization of the Austrian army, and it was chiefly through his efforts that the Theresian Military Academy was established at Wiener-Neustadt in 1751. When a Third Silesian War broke out, he was not actively employed in the first campaigns of the war, but in 1757 he was placed at the head of the army which was raised to relieve Prague. On 18 June 1757 Daun decisively defeated Frederick for the first time in his career in the desperately fought Battle of Kolin. In commemoration of this brilliant exploit, the queen immediately instituted a military order bearing her name, and Daun was awarded the first Grand Cross of that order. The union of the relieving army with the forces of Prince Charles at Prague reduced Daun to the position of second in command, and in that capacity he took part in the pursuit of the Prussians and the victory of Breslau.\n\nFrederick now reappeared and won the most brilliant victory of the age at Leuthen. Daun was present on that field, but was not held accountable for the disaster, and when Prince Charles resigned his command, Daun was appointed in his place. With the campaign of 1758 began the war of manoeuvre in which Daun, though missing some opportunities to crush the Prussians through over-caution, at least maintained a steady and cool resistance to the fiery strategy of Frederick. In 1758 Major-General Laudon, acting under Daun's instructions, forced the king to raise the siege of Olmütz (Battle of Domstadtl), and later in the same year Daun himself surprised Frederick at the Battle of Hochkirch and inflicted a severe defeat upon him (14 October). Despite the tactical success and capture of many munitions and supplies that Daun achieved at Hochkirch, his failure to pursue Frederick allowed the Prussians to block his path into Silesia, meaning that his victory counted for little. In the following year the war of manoeuvre continued, and on 20 and 21 November he surrounded the entire corps of General Finck at Maxen, forcing the Prussians to surrender. These successes were counterbalanced in the following year by the defeat of Laudon at Liegnitz, which was attributed partly to the dilatoriness of Daun, and Daun's own subsequent defeat by Zieten's bold attack in the great Battle of Torgau. In this engagement, Daun was so severely wounded that he had to return to Vienna to recuperate. However, Daun and his forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Prussians and were able to retreat in good order.\n\nDaun continued to command until the end of the war, and afterwards worked with the greatest energy at the reorganization of the imperial forces. In 1762 he had been appointed president of the \"Hofkriegsrat\". By order of Maria Theresa, a monument to his memory was erected by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll in the church of the Augustinians, with an inscription describing him as the \"saviour of her states.\" In 1888, the 56th Regiment of Austrian Infantry was named after him. \n\nCalled the Austrian Fabius Cunctator, Daun has been criticized for the dilatoriness of his operations, but wariness was not misplaced when one faced a general like Frederick, who was quick and unpredictable. His inability to exploit a victory, on the other hand, might not be so easily excused. The relationship with his daring general Ernst Gideon von Laudon remained tense.\n\nHis first cousin Eleonora Ernestina married the Marquis of Pombal, the noted Portuguese statesman.\n\nFor an overview of the system of military ranks that existed in the Austro-Hungarian Empire up to the first World War see Comparative military ranks of World War I\n\nSee \"Der deutsche Fabius Cunctator, oder Leben und Thaten seiner Excellentz, des Herrn Leopold Joseph Maria Reichsgrafen von Daun ... \" (S.l.: s.n., 1759–1760), and works dealing with the wars of the period.\n"}

Tailgating, which primarily takes place in the United States and Canada, often involves consuming alcoholic beverages and grilling food. Tailgate parties occur in the parking lots at stadiums and arenas, before and occasionally after games and concerts. People attending such a party are said to be 'tailgating'. Many people participate even if their vehicles do not have tailgates. Tailgate parties also involve people bringing their own alcoholic beverages, barbecues, food etc. which is sampled and shared among fans attending the tailgate. Tailgates are intended to be non-commercial events, so selling items to the fans is frowned upon.\n\nTailgate parties have spread to the pre-game festivities at sporting events besides American football, such as basketball, hockey, association football, and baseball, and also occur at non-sporting events such as weddings, barbecues, and concerts.\n\nTailgating typically involves the consumption of alcoholic beverages or soft drinks and the grilling of various meat products. Popular tailgate party foods include picnic staples such as bratwurst, hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans, and cold salads like coleslaw or potato salad. Some food products were created because of tailgate parties. A brand of pimento cheese, called Palmetto Cheese, got its start at Atlanta Braves tailgate parties.\n\nLawn games such as KanJam, cornhole, ladder golf, Polish horseshoes, Louisville Chugger, Jarts, washer pitching and Sholf are very popular during tailgates and tailgate parties. Lawn games are associated with tailgating primarily because of the simplicity in the game materials. Lawn games carry the connotation of drinking games because of their presence during tailgates. Other games that are often played include beer pong and flipcup. It is also common for fans to bring sports balls such as footballs, soccer balls, and the like to casually play with. Many tailgaters have external stereos or use their car's sound system to play music, and it is not unusual to see some tailgate parties hook up a television set and antenna/satellite to an electric generator so partygoers can watch other sporting events.\n\nIn schools and communities throughout the United States, there are athletic departments, coaches and parents of student athletes who rely on post-game tailgating parties to build community and support for their program and team. Smaller, underfunded programs are assisted by the voluntary participation of parents and friends to feed the team and coaching staff post-competition, which establishes a strong core of support year after year.\n\nIn 2007, the NFL angered many football fans by banning tailgating before the Super Bowl. The NFL cited security risks, though many suspected it had more to do with corporate sponsored events than any real threat. In 2008, an online petition began circulating to encourage the NFL to lift the no tailgating at the Super Bowl policy. Members of the sports media also questioned the validity of NFL's claim that security concerns was the real reason for the ban.\n\nIn April 2019, Ontario Premier Doug Ford's staff announced the legalization of tailgating at sporting events across the province.\n\nIn the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Any Given Sundance\", Homer takes his family to a tailgate party. He makes them get up early in order to be at the stadium hours before the football game, and states that \"the game is nothing\", the tailgate party being the only reason for their being there.\n\nSeason 3 of the Travel Channel original series \"Man v. Food\" had a tailgating special consisting of various segments from previous episodes that featured food that would make an ultimate tailgate party.\n\nA number of television commercials, especially those aired during football games, feature tailgating culture, including those for Bud Light beer and cellphones.\n\nNomadic tailgating is a variant of a traditional tailgate party. With nomadic tailgating, people carry backpack or similar bags, filled with snacks and beverages--usually alcoholic ones, like beer--and roam the tailgate parties that are held before sporting events (usually, football). The nomadic tailgater has no vehicle or \"home base\" of his own. Nomadic tailgating occurs in one of two circumstances: (1) where the nomadic tailgater has too many tailgate parties to attend (i.e., has several friends holding tailgate parties on a single day); or (2) where the nomadic tailgater has no tailgate parties to attend.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864883", "title": "Worldwar series", "text": "Worldwar series\n\nThe Worldwar series is the fan name given to a series of eight alternate history science fiction novels by Harry Turtledove. Its premise is an alien invasion of Earth during World War II, and includes Turtledove's \"Worldwar\" tetralogy, as well as the \"Colonization\" trilogy, and the novel \"Homeward Bound\". The series' time span ranges from 1942 to 2031. The early series was nominated for a Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 1996.\n\n\"Worldwar\" deals with a military invasion that begins on or around May 30, 1942 by a force of aliens that calls itself The Race, a reptilian species. It had reached Earth orbit in December 1941 but delayed the attack for various reasons.\n\nAlthough the Race has the advantage of superior technology, its information on humanity had been collected by robotic probe during the 12th century AD. The invaders are surprised to find that humanity progressed far more rapidly than any other species that they had previously studied and conquered. Contrary to its expectations, at the time of invasion, the Race's technology is only marginally more advanced than 20th-century Earth technology. The commander hesitates, and considers turning back without revealing The Race's presence to the humans but finally decides to avoid the disgrace of that course of action.\n\nThe narrative follows the intersecting fortunes of a large number of human and alien characters. Notably, the series depicts how the Axis and Allied powers must co-operate to fight the alien menace.\n\nAs is gradually revealed, the Race unified its home planet into a single state with a military technology at a level similar to our history's late 20th century. It then had tens of thousands of years of further history, but for most of the time, it fought no wars and so had no incentive or need to develop more advanced weapons. Indeed, for most of the time, it maintained no army at all. Only the discovery of other planets with intelligent beings made the Emperor proclaim a \"Soldier's Time\" and build up an army, and the weapons developed at the last wars when the home planet was unified were quite enough to conquer the other planets. With Earth, it turned out differently since the various human nations were faced with arms some decades ahead of theirs but were soon able to close the gap.\n\nTurtledove approaches the novels' science fiction scenario by focusing less on the technological and fantasy elements that are typically associated with the genre. He shows more concern for the role of more mundane affairs, such as the political repercussions of an alliance between the Allied and Axis powers, the impact the presence of alien creatures has on human society, and the ways in which warfare is paradoxically a hindrance to civilization and simultaneously a catalyst for the progress of civilization. Particular attention is given to the deep dilemma facing the Jews in both Poland and Palestine. The invaders, landing in 1942, stopped the ongoing Holocaust and closed down Auschwitz - for which Jews are understandably grateful; but collaborating with the reptile invaders would brand the Jews as traitors to Humanity.\n\nThe first series is made up of four volumes:\n\nIt ends with neither humanity nor the aliens triumphing. Instead, each side fights to the point that facing mutually-assured destruction, they settle into an uneasy ceasefire. The aliens want to colonize Earth and have nuclear weapons but want to use them only sparingly. They cannot colonize a radioactive wasteland after a full-scale nuclear exchange.\n\nThe invasion ultimately ends when all of the major Allied and Axis powers manage to develop their own nuclear weapons, resulting in a stalemate. The Race is left in control of roughly half the planet, primarily colonial possessions in the Southern Hemisphere: Africa, South and Central America, Australia, and most of Asia aside from the Soviet Union and a few Japanese coastal holdings.\n\nThe second series of novels, set in the 1960s, deals with the interaction between surviving humans and the Race. Opening with the arrival of the colonization fleet, the series ends with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the establishment of a permanently-manned US space station in the asteroid belt. Part of the series focuses on the Reich-Race War of the mid-1960s, when the Greater German Reich and the Race fight a nuclear war.\n\nThe Germans lose and are forced to allow France to become an independent nation again under a new Fourth Republic. Nonetheless, it is a costly victory for the Race: fighting Germany on its own after 20 years of human technological advancement proved to be much more difficult than fighting all free human nations earlier. It is left obvious to both sides that long-term trends are in humanity's favor.\n\nThe Race is also faced with ongoing guerilla wars in much of the territory they conquered, especially by Communists in China and by Islamists in the Arab World. The Race - confirmed Conservative Monarchists who never developed any concept of Republic, and whose only religion is veneration of their Divine Emperor and the ghosts of past Emperors - find it difficult to understand either Communism or Islam, but can't deny that both are highly effective ideologies motivating humans to fight and cause considerable difficulties to their occupiers. \n\nAnother major issue turns out to be ginger - an innocent flavoring in the human cuisine but a powerful narcotic for the Race's metabolism. This creates problems of addiction and helps create new criminal networks involving both humans and rogue members of the Race. Moreover, inhaling ginger causes females of the Race to become sexually active, outside of their normal mating season. This creates new problems, as the Race has no concept whatsoever of sexual activity being private, and when sexually aroused tend to engage in indiscriminate orgies, to the scandal of humans who happen to watch. For their part, members of the Race find it difficult to understand humans' insistence on sex being a private act, and the humans' great annoyance when reptiles walk in on them while engaged in it. \n\n\nThe final novel in the saga deals with humanity reaching the Race's homeworld, \"Home\" (Tau Ceti II).\n\nThe following is a list of some of the major characters from the series.\n\n\n\nNumerous historical characters also appear, some having brief \"cameos\" and others having significant parts in the plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the scientific study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its ultimate fate, as well as the laws of science that govern these areas.\n\nThe term \"cosmology\" was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's \"Glossographia\", and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in \"Cosmologia Generalis\".\n\nReligious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology.\n\nPhysical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.\n\nTheoretical astrophysicist David N. Spergel has described cosmology as a \"historical science\" because \"when we look out in space, we look back in time\" due to the finite nature of the speed of light.\n\nPhysics and astrophysics have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang, followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation; an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago. Cosmogony studies the origin of the Universe, and cosmography maps the features of the Universe.\n\nIn Diderot's Encyclopédie, cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).\n\nMetaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius's observation that a man's place in that relationship: \"He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is.\"\n\nPhysical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as \"celestial mechanics\", the study of the heavens. Greek philosophers Aristarchus of Samos, Aristotle, and Ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories. The geocentric Ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when Nicolaus Copernicus, and subsequently Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, proposed a heliocentric system. This is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology.\nIsaac Newton's \"Principia Mathematica\", published in 1687, was the first description of the law of universal gravitation. It provided a physical mechanism for Kepler's laws and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle—that the bodies on earth obey the same physical laws as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.\n\nModern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with Albert Einstein's publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper \"Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity\" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of World War I). General relativity prompted cosmogonists such as Willem de Sitter, Karl Schwarzschild, and Arthur Eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 Alexander Friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the Great Debate took place, with early cosmologists such as Heber Curtis and Ernst Öpik determining that some nebulae seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.\nIn parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only; while Heber D. Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way.\n\nSubsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the cosmological constant, introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an expanding universe, depending on its value. Thus the Big Bang model was proposed by the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by Edwin Hubble's discovery of the redshift in 1929 and later by the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies.\n\nSince around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the COBE, WMAP and Planck satellites, large new galaxy redshift surveys including 2dfGRS and SDSS, and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing. These observations matched the predictions of the cosmic inflation theory, a modified Big Bang theory, and the specific version known as the Lambda-CDM model. This has led many to refer to modern times as the \"golden age of cosmology\".\n\nOn 17 March 2014, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the detection of gravitational waves, providing strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang. However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the cosmic inflation findings was reported.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, at the \"Planck 2014\" meeting in Ferrara, Italy, astronomers reported that the universe is 13.8 billion years old and is composed of 4.9% atomic matter, 26.6% dark matter and 68.5% dark energy.\n\nReligious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.\n\nCosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion. In modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like dialectics. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:\n\n\nTable notes: the term \"static\" simply means not expanding and not contracting.

It was mostly given to civil servants and military officers, as well as those upon whom the lower rank of an Order had been conferred. The noun \"Edler\" comes from the adjective \"edel\" (\"noble\"), and translated literally means \"noble [person]\". In accordance with the rules of German grammar, the word can also appear as \"Edle\", \"Edlem\", or \"Edlen\" depending on case, gender, and number. \nOriginally, from the Middle Ages, under the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a fief, often in the form of heritable land worked by vassals. To preserve the feudal naming practice, even in cases where upper-ranking bureaucrats received patents of nobility for long service and/or merit, as in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries (see \"noblesse de robe\"), the old practice of denoting a noble with a territorial designation was continued out of a sense of tradition.\n\nThus, landless nobles were created under the formula \"Edler von XYZ\": either the surname or a place-name followed the German preposition \"von\", which, in this context, was taken to denote nobility. The English translation of this is normally \"Noble of XYZ\". Frequently, the nobiliary particle \"von\" (English 'of', or, more commonly, the French \"particule de noblesse\" 'de', meaning the same thing), was represented simply by the abbreviation \"v.\" to specify that it was being used to denote a member of the nobility, and not simply as the ordinary German-language preposition \"von\". \n\nAn example of such a person's name and title is \"Josef Draginda, Edler v. Draginda\". His wife would have been, for example, \"Johanna Draginda, Edle v. Draginda\". Another example is the Austro-Hungarian general Viktor Weber Edler von Webenau, who signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti between Austria-Hungary and the Entente at the end of World War I.\n\nThe wife and the daughters of an Edler were titled \"Edle\".\n\nIn Czech this title is translated and used as \"šlechtic z\".\n\nThe title \"Edler\" was banned in Austria with the abolition of Austrian nobility in 1919. In Germany, when the German nobility was stripped of its privileges under the Article 109 of Weimar Constitution in 1919, the title was transformed into a dependent part of the legal surname. \n\nSince that time, the terms \"Edle\", \"Edler von\" etc. are not to be translated, as they have lost their title status. These terms now appear following the given name, e.g. Wolfgang Gans Edler Herr zu Putlitz. As dependent parts of the surnames (\"nichtselbständige Namensbestandteile\"), the terms \"Edle\", \"Edler von\" etc. are ignored in alphabetical sorting of names, as is the eventual nobility particle, and might or might not be used by those bearing them. The unofficial titles do, however, retain prestige in some circles of society.\n\n"}

LPS began its history as the prep department of Northwestern College, a pre-ministerial college established in 1865. The prep department received its own identity in 1974 as Northwestern Preparatory School (NPS). In 1995, Northwestern College moved to New Ulm, Minnesota and combined with Dr. Martin Luther College to form Martin Luther College. In the same year, Martin Luther Preparatory School (MLPS) of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin was closed and combined with NPS to form Luther Preparatory School.\n\nThe mission of Luther Preparatory School is to prepare and encourage young men and women for the full-time ministry in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.\n\nPrep's mascot is the Phoenix. LPS plays in the Capitol Conference of WIAA. Fall sports include football and soccer for boys, volleyball and tennis for girls, and cross country for both. In the winter, there is boys' and girls' basketball, as well as men's wrestling. Spring sports are baseball, softball, track and field, boys' tennis, girls' soccer, and golf. Luther Prep also offers intramural sports, such as basketball and volleyball.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864909", "title": "Window film", "text": "Window film\n\nWindow film is a thin laminate film that can be installed to the interior or exterior of glass surfaces in automobiles and boats and also to the interior or exterior of glass in homes and buildings. It is usually made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family, due to its clarity, tensile strength, dimensional stability, and ability to accept a variety of surface-applied or embedded treatments.\n\nWindow films are generically categorised by their construction components (dyed, pigmented, metallized, ceramic or nano), by their intended use (automotive, marine or architectural), by substrate type (glass or polycarbonate), and/or by their technical performance (privacy, solar control, safety and security).\n\nWindow film is normally installed by professional service companies but there are also DIY kits widely available.\n\nThe International Window Film Association, founded in 1991, provides unbranded information about window films.\n\nThere are many different grades, shades, colours, and thicknesses of available window films built to offer solutions to a variety of challenges. Window films are a retrofit upgrade for existing glass that can be used to address problems inherent to glazing, including:\n\nWindow films are an extremely cost-effective method to reduce heating and cooling costs in existing buildings by reducing the amount of heat transfer through glazing.\n\nHeat rejection films are normally applied to the interior of flat glass windows to reduce the amount of infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation entering windows. Such films are usually dyed or metalized (which can be transparent to visible light) to convert incoming solar radiation to infrared radiation, which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior. Modern window film technology has created ceramic window films which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration. The ceramic and metallic window films usually cost 50-100+ percent more than regular window film but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent. Ceramic window films cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase by reflecting and absorbing Infrared radiation (radiant heat).\n\nTo keep the sun's heat out of the house, a low-emissivity coating should be applied to the outside pane of glazed windows. If the windows are designed to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.\n\nSecurity films are applied to glass so when the glass is broken it holds together, preventing dangerous shards from flying about, or to make it more difficult for an intruder to gain entry. Typically applied to commercial glass, these films are made of heavy-gauge plastic and are intended to maintain the integrity of glass when subject to heavy impact. The most robust security films are capable of preventing fragmentation and the production of hazardous glass shards from forces such as bomb blasts. Some companies have even experimented with bullet ballistics and multiple layers of security film. Another key application for security window films (safety window films) is on large areas of \"flat glass\" such as storefront windows, sliding glass doors, and larger windows that are prone to hurricane damage. These security films, if applied properly, can also provide protection for vehicles. These security films are often tinted and can be up to 400 micrometers (µm) thick, compared to less than 50 µm for ordinary tint films. If anchored correctly, they can also provide protection for architectural glazing in the event of an explosion. A layer of film (of 100 µm thickness or greater) can prevent the ejection of spall when a projectile impacts on its surface, which otherwise creates small dagger-like shards of glass that can cause injury.\n\nSwitchable films can be switched from opaque to clear by a safe voltage under 36V AC. In its opaque state, it can be perfectly used as a projection screen that is viewable from both sides. 3G switchable film also has UV (100%) and IR (94%) blocking functions and security function.\n\nGraphic design films are generally colored vinyl or frosted. Frosted finish films closely resemble sandblasted or acid-etched glass, while vinyl films are available in a range of colors. Both types of films are commonly used in commercial applications.\n\nPrivacy films reduce visibility through the glass. Privacy film for flat-glass commercial and residential applications may be silvered, offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. It may also be frosted, rendering the window translucent but not transparent. Privacy films for automobiles are available in gradients of darkness, with the darker tints commonly known as \"limo tint.\"\n\nCorrectly applied mirror film can create one-way mirrors. Note that in order to be effective the light differential must be from 6 to 10 times greater to maintain the intended performance. For example, the buildings in a city, during the daytime are difficult to see into, at night however, they can be seen in with ease and if a light is on in the interior space it is easily seen along with the contents.\n\nOther benefits include protection for passengers in the rear of automobiles, protection from UV rays (which have some harmful effects), cooling for pets, greater privacy, reduced chance of theft (because valuables are less visible), reduced glare and reflection on liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and protection for those who have conditions involving photosensitivity or skin sensitivity, such as lupus (SLE). Window film is also considered more effective and practical than stick-on blinds.\n\nProtection from UV light can be accomplished by film that addresses only the UV spectrum. As UV is one of the main sources of fading, it can prolong the life of fixtures and fittings. Basic colorless clear films reject (absorbs) some UV radiation up to 380 nm, and depending on the manufacturer, UV inhibitors are added to the polyester, with specialist films offering protection to 400 nm. Tinted films are necessary for protection to 500 nm.\n\nWindow films filter out over 99% of UV rays to 380 nm, reducing the main factor in fading. However, additional factors such as solar heat, visible light, humidity, and presence or absence of chemical vapors also contribute to fading. Therefore, the greatest protection from fading is offered by tinted or metallised window films that reject large levels of heat and visible light, in addition to UV.\n\nNot all films are suitable for all glass. The absorptance of the glass and the film, the size of the pane, the thickness of the glass, the construction of the window should be considered in terms of single pane, insulated glass, treated (with a low-emissivity coating), laminated or toughened.\n\nAdvice on the appropriate selection of film for the glass is vital to ensure that the glass does not crack as a result of thermal stress. However, it is possible that a pane of glass may break subsequent to the application of an appropriate film, because the pane has been damaged during the glazing of the window, or as a result of movement of the building or other physical stresses that are not apparent at the time of the application of the film.\n\nGlass may crack subsequent to the application of sign writing or if heavy, thermally efficient drapes are hung close to the glass, particularly if the edges of the glass are damaged.\n\nThe chances of glass breakage occurring subsequent to the application of film or sign writing or the hanging of drapes, are very small. However breakage can occur and it is impossible to predict the edge condition of the glass without removing it from the frame – an approach that is not practical.\n\nHeating and cooling systems have energy costs, and window films can be used to increase building insulation.\nModern windows with low-solar-gain glass do not need retrofit films, but since most of the existing windows do not have a low solar heat gain, window films make a lot of sense as a retrofit energy improvement. They can provide thermal comfort and are one of the most cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly energy improvements, especially in hot and mixed climates.\n\nUnder certain conditions, window film will exhibit iridescence also known as Thin film Interference (TFI) and is well known in the Aviation industry. This phenomenon usually occurs at night, when the source of illumination within a building is fluorescent lighting. The amount of iridescence may vary from almost imperceptible to very visible. It most frequently occurs when the film is constructed with scratch resistance protection. When iridescence does occur in window film, the best way to stop it is to prevent the fluorescent light from illuminating the film or to use an alternative type of light.\n\nWindow tints can be used in applications like shopfront windows, office block windows, and house windows. This is often done to increase privacy, and decrease heating and cooling costs. Window tints are used in some energy efficient buildings.\n\nWindow films are also used to apply see-through graphics to glass and other transparent surfaces, to provide advertising, branding, signage and decoration. See-through graphics are most commonly applied using a perforated window film with a graphic visible from one side but not the other side, which remains see-though. Vehicle wraps on buses are perhaps the widest application of see-through graphics.\n\nThe thicker window films known as safety and security window film are designed to perform under extreme conditions, and as such there are specific standard criteria these films should meet, such as American standards ANSI Z.97, CPSC 16 CFR 1201, Cat II (400 ft-lb), and the British Standards BS 6206 (Class A, B, C). The European Committee for Standardization offer the EN12600 standard Classification of Resistance of Glazing to Impact. Often, building codes dictate that a film must have a report verifying that it has met at least one of these standards.\n\nSolar window film is usually subject to less critical testing. However, standards are in place to maintain a level of quality in the industry. The ANSI Standards ASTM E903 and ASTM D1044-93 relate to the solar/UV transmission properties and abrasion resistance, respectively. The larger window film manufacturers use these standards to guarantee the quality of their raw materials and finished products.\n\nAutomobile window tinting reduces the \"Visible Light Transmission\" (VLT) through car windows. This can be problematic at night, or when motorists must be able to see through the windows of other vehicles in order to spot hazards. Police also may want to be able to identify the passengers or any potential threat inside a vehicle. Therefore, in many jurisdictions, there are laws to restrict the darkness of tinting.\n\n\"Factory tint\", done at the time of manufacture is generally not an applied film, but instead is done by dyeing the inside of the glass with a darkened pigment during glass manufacturing, an electrical process known as \"deep dipping.\" The pigment gives the glass a tint, but doesn't provide UV ray protection or heat rejection like most window films do. The average VLT of factory tint is between 15–26%.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864910", "title": "Matthew 1:19", "text": "Matthew 1:19\n\nMatthew 1:19 is the nineteenth verse of the first chapter in the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. It is part of the description of the events surrounding the birth of Jesus. Joseph has found Mary to be pregnant and in this verse considers leaving her.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe New International Version translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:19.\n\nThat this verse refers to Joseph as Mary's husband does not conflict or mean a change in circumstances from , where he is merely her betrothed. The betrothal of the period was a formal arrangement and the couple can reasonably be considered husband and wife while betrothed.\n\nExactly what this verse means by Joseph being a \"just man\" is much discussed. The Greek term is \"dikaios\", and it has variously been translated as just, righteous, upright, and of good character. Brown outlines three basic interpretations. Most of the ancient commentators of the Bible interpreted it as meaning that Joseph was law abiding, and as such decided to divorce Mary in keeping with Mosaic Law when he found her pregnant by another. However, his righteousness was tempered by mercy and he thus kept the affair private. A second view, first put forward by Clement of Alexandria, is held by most modern Christians. This view sees Joseph's righteousness, not in his rigid adherence to the laws, but rather in his mercy itself. By this view the decision to ensure Mary was not shamed was not an exception to Joseph's righteousness, but the proof of it. By this view mercy is more righteous than obedience. A third view is based on the idea that Joseph already knew that Mary's child was divinely conceived. This is in keeping with the Gospel of Luke in which Mary is quickly told how she became pregnant. By this interpretation Joseph's righteousness is his great piety that leads him to quickly accept Mary's story and his desire not to intrude with God's plan for his new wife.\n\nSome scholars have tried to do away with the disquieting word divorce in this verse, and most older translations did so. Since Joseph has just been described as righteous having him consider a divorce could imply that divorce is righteous. Especially in the 19th century, a number of scholars tried to read alternate meanings into the term. One proposal was that it merely meant separate: that the couple would split but that legally they would remain married. However recent discoveries have found that legal avenues for divorce existed at the time in question. One of the clearest pieces of evidence is a divorce record from 111 AD, coincidentally between a couple named Mary and Joseph, that was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Greek word here translated as divorce is \"aphiemi\", and the only other time it appears is in where Paul uses it to describe the legal separation of a man and wife. Almost all modern translators today feel that divorce is the best word. Today, versions that do not use the word \"divorce\" do so for doctrinaire reasons. This verse also provides one of the main scriptural justifications for divorce for churches that accept the practice. Since the marriage in question was never consummated, the divorce Joseph was contemplating does not violate the beliefs of churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church, who reject divorce.\n\nWhat the verse means by \"privately\" is also open to discussion. Rabbinic law from the period gives two methods of divorce for reason of adultery. One was to bring the matter to the village council, which would hold a hearing and, if the allegations were proved, grant a divorce. The second method was to have the evidence presented and approved by two witnesses who would then certify the divorce. By \"quietly\" most scholars believe the verse means that Joseph would take the second option. Gundry argues that the witnesses were necessary to prevent a woman denying that the divorce had taken place. Gundry believes that by \"quietly\" the verse means that even the witnesses would be forgone and the separation would be an entirely private affair.\n\n"}

The duo of Dylan Thomas Moore and Joe Frank on synthesizers later teamed up with Jared Hendrickson (now known as Jared Louche) to create this EP. It was financed by Zalman Fishman, a nightclub owner who founded the now defunct Fifth Colvmn Records. Zalman became involved when he was introduced to Joe Frank through a mutual friend.\n\nThis release was recorded illegally at National Geographic's studios after hours and mixed in Los Angeles by Hilary Bercovici, a friend of Frank's. Dylan and Jared moved to New York City, where they continued Chemlab without Frank until the band's implosion in 1997. The EP showcased Moore's burgeoning talents, his aggressive, experimental programming and Jared Hendrickson's apocalyptic vision of the world. It was noisy yet hooky, the sound a mixture of Ministry, Front 242, Skinny Puppy and such first-wave industrial bands as SPK and Throbbing Gristle yet distinctly their own. It instantly struck a chord in the nascent American machine rock/industrial music scene and became an instant underground hit on dance floors across the country. Hendrickson's aggressive promotion ensured that the EP was reviewed in most of the music magazines and trade journals of the day and the first 1000 vinyl copies sold out very quickly. On the strength of excellent reviews and a strong buzz the band was asked to support Nine Inch Nails on their \"Now I'm Nothing\" tour in the winter of 1991. Moore wrote two songs specifically for that tour, 'Gas Mask' and 'X-Flipped' and although they performed them every night and they very much showed the harder and even more experimental direction the band would take on their subsequent albums, neither song was ever recorded. The tour was a smash success of sold-out shows that solidly planted Chemlab before the exploding underground scene.\n\nIn 1994, the compilation album \"Magnetic Field Remixes\" was released and is essentially a reissue of this EP. The album includes all the songs found on this release, with some from the next album and one previously unreleased track. Some of the tracks found on the compilation have been remixed.\n\nThe first chemlab release showcases a much more industrial sound, with far less guitars used and more unorganised and chaotic noises instrumentally.

It is the third game in the \"Sly Cooper\" franchise. \"Sly 3\" has optional 3-D stages, and comes with a pair of 3-D glasses inside the manual. The game received generally positive reviews from the gaming press.\n\nOn November 9, 2010, \"Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves\" was released on PlayStation 3 as part of \"The Sly Collection\".\n\nNew variations in the game include additional playable characters besides those of Sly, Murray and Bentley. Firstly, Inspector Carmelita Fox is a playable character in some of the mini-games and a few times in the main game. Secondly, some new characters have been introduced, including a shaman named The Guru and a mouse named Penelope. Finally, characters from previous titles, such as Dimitri and the Panda King, are playable as well.\n\nFurthermore, Bentley and Murray have the ability to pick-pocket in this game. \nMurray hoists stunned or unsuspecting guards above his head and shakes them down for coins and loot. The coins must be picked up off the ground after the guard is shaken. Bentley uses a fishing rod-like magnet to reel in coins and loot. When the magnet attaches, Bentley moves away from the guard to pick the pocket. Pickpocketed loot no longer needs to be sold back at the safe house. The amount an item is worth is added immediately to the coin count. Special treasure is absent from the over world.\n\nThe game also contains 3-D sections. 3-D glasses have been distributed with each new copy of the game, and are used in certain parts of the game. However, 3-D effects are optional, allowing the player to view the levels in standard 2-D instead. Some levels are playable in 3-D from the beginning, while other levels require the 3-D feature to be unlocked. The 3-D effect is focused upon certain objects in the background rather than the characters themselves, minimizing the necessary blue/red separation and making it easier for observers without 3-D glasses.\n\nSly 3 features new gameplay elements and skills, such as safe-cracking, searching for clues and objects in paintings, aerial combat, disguises, pirate ship battles, and conversations. However, the removal of clue bottles and vaults was unpopular with players.\n\nTo increase replay value, an offline multiplayer mode is included, along with challenges and extra movies unlocked for specific game completion percentages. The multiplayer games are: Cops and Robbers, Hackathon, Bi-Plane Duel, and Galleon Duel. Challenges are missions that are set with specific standards, along with a Treasure Hunt mission for each world attained at the end of the game.\n\nSet a year after the events of \"\", Sly Cooper, Bentley, Murray, and other unidentified characters attempt to open the Cooper Vault on Kaine Island. Unfortunately, they are intercepted by Dr. M, the owner of the island. Murray and Bentley escape, but a monster grabs Sly. During this scene, Sly's life flashes before his eyes, and the game flashes back.\n\nSly learned that the Cooper Vault was hidden on Kaine Island from one of his father's colleagues, Jim McSweeney. The vault contains the accumulated wealth of the Cooper Clan built up over the centuries. Sly went to find the vault, only to discover that M had built a fortress on the island in an attempt to get at the wealth hidden in the vault. Sly needed additional experts in order to get past Dr. M's extensive security; he needed the Cooper Gang back in action.\n\nFirst, Sly and Bentley seek Murray, who had left the team due to guilt for causing Bentley's leg injury, which would end up paralyzing him. They learn about a mob boss, Octavio, who operates in Venice, Italy, where Murray was. Sly finds Dimitri in a cell at the local police station. He agrees to find Murray if Sly helps him escape. Sly finds Murray, while evading Carmelita Fox, who had become more hateful towards crimes since their last encounter. Murray had become a trainee for a peace-loving figure known as the Guru in order to become more peaceful. Murray refuses to rejoin Sly and Bentley until the canals are clean, the task the Guru gave to him. Sly and Bentley take down Octavio, who had been polluting the canals with tar as part of a scheme to threaten the city into liking opera again. After putting together some plans, they destroy Octavio's comeback recital, but Octavio injures Bentley, making Murray so mad that he quits his training and battles Octavio and defeats him. Octavio is arrested, and Murray rejoins the team.\n\nMurray misses the Guru, so the gang flies to Yuendumu, Northern Territory, Australia, to find the Guru, but construction by miners has taken over the land. Sly finds the Guru, but the Guru won't leave his cell until he has his mystical moon stone and staff. Sly recovers them, Bentley gives them back to the Guru, and the Guru breaks out. He agrees to join the team if Sly and the gang help remove the miners from his land. To do so, they have to destroy the Mask of Dark Earth, an evil demonic mask that makes its wearer a vicious giant and more powerful. While Carmelita goes after Sly, the Mask of Dark Earth gets stuck to her face, and she starts growing at an uncontrollable rate. Sly has to climb up her bootlegs and remove it. After the Mask of Dark Earth is destroyed by Carmelita's mercenaries, the Guru joins the Cooper Gang.\n\nIn need of a robotics combat expert beyond Bentley's abilities, he meets a Dutch mouse named Penelope online. She agrees to join their team if they can take down her boss, the Black Baron, an expert flier who has his own flying competition, which he had never lost. The gang travels to Kinderdijk, Holland, Netherlands, where they enter Sly in the flying competition. While there, they meet Dimitri, who agrees to tell them where to find the competition roster if Sly agrees return the favor. Muggshot, Sly's former enemy in Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, is also flying in the competition, but Sly gets Carmelita to arrest him. After the gang sabotages other teams, Sly beats the Black Baron, who then battles Sly on the wing of a plane. Penelope is revealed to be the Black Baron in costume, and Sly wins the competition. Penelope tells the crew that her reason for being the Baron was because she was too young to enter flying competitions at her current age. Penelope joins the gang without hesitation.\n\nIn need a demolitions expert beyond Bentley's abilities, the team recruits Sly's former enemy, the Panda King. After discovering that he had forsaken his life of crime, they confront him, and he agrees to join if they help him rescue his daughter, Jing King. General Tsao has kidnapped her and plans to force her to marry him. Murray locates and recovers the old team van, aided first by Penelope and then by the Panda King, who recognizes the bond Murray shares with the van is the same he shares with his daughter. General Tsao steals Bentley's laptop and Sly is forced to confront and defeat him to get it back. After finally rescuing Jing King, Tsao summons a stone dragon which grabs Penelope. Sly defeats the dragon and saves Penelope before escaping with the gang while Carmelita arrests General Tsao and escorts him to jail. The Panda King joins the gang.\n\nLater, Dimitri e-mails Sly to remind him the favor he owed him back in Holland, so Dimitri buys tickets for the whole gang for a cruise to Blood Bath Bay in the Caribbean Sea. After learning that his grandfather, Reme Lousteau, had his diving gear and treasure he had collected stolen by a pirate named Black Spot Pete, they attempt to get it back, but find that Captain LeFwee, another dangerous pirate known as the smartest man on the seven seas, had stolen the treasure map. After stealing a ship, they sail to find Reme Lousteau's treasure and gear, and successfully recover it. However, Captain LeFwee ambushes them during the heist and kidnaps Penelope. They prepare an assault on Lefwee's skull keep, which involves taming a giant squid called Crusher. Crusher and the Guru defeat Lefwee's men while Bently frees Penelope. Bentley is injured during the getaway, and Penelope battles Captain LeFwee and knocks him into the harbor, where he is eaten by sharks. Then, Dimitri joins the team as their frogman, and Bentley and Penelope become a couple.\n\nThe game then returns to the present day, where Sly is struggling to escape from one of Dr. M's monsters. Sly realizes that he has been cowardly towards Carmelita and regrets never acting on his affections. Carmelita arrives on the island with armed guards and battles Dr. M, intending to capture both Sly and Dr. M. She defeats the monster, but allows both Sly and Dr. M to escape. The gang works to retrieve Sly's cane, which is the key to the vault, battling Dr. M multiple times in the process. During these events, Dr. M reveals that he used to be partners with Sly's father, but felt he was treated unfairly and wants to steal the Cooper fortune.\n\nAfter fighting security, they finally break into the vault, where Sly sees the history and wealth of his ancestors. Meanwhile, Dr. M breaks into the vault and battles Murray and Bentley first before following Sly. After a one-on-one battle with Dr. M, Sly emerges victorious. After the fight, Dr, M once again compares him to his father, but Sly insists that everyone is an individual, and that he is just himself. Carmelita arrives to arrest them both. However Dr. M shoots a blast towards her, and Sly jumps in front of her as a human shield. Carmelita defeats Dr. M and checks up on Sly. He appears to suffer from amnesia, which Carmelita exploits to pretend that Sly is her partner (called Constable Cooper). Together, they escape, and Dr. M is killed when the entire vault becomes unstable and collapses. The rest of the Cooper Gang finds Sly's cane and calling card next to an alternate opening into the vault. When Sly never returns, the gang splits up, except for Bentley and Penelope, who continue their relationship.\n\nDimitri becomes a rich scuba diver; the Panda King returns to China and starts living two doors down from Jing King, while he screens all her future husbands (so far, she is still unmarried); Murray goes on to complete his training with the Guru and later becomes a professional race car driver with the team van; the Guru, after finishing training Murray, teaches his mystic art to a group of rock stars; and Penelope and Bentley have created a new vault to contain the Cooper wealth that is shielded by lasers, and . In the end, Sly is seen holding hands with Carmelita on a balcony, when Bentley spots them. Sly looks straight at Bentley and winks. This shows that Sly had faked his amnesia to start a relationship with Carmelita.\n\n\"Sly 3\" was well received, having aggregate scores of 83 out of 100 on Metacritic and 84.18% on GameRankings.\n\nComplex's Rich Knight called \"Sly 3\" the best game in the series and the 20th best PlayStation 2 game.\n\nBrian Fleming of Sucker Punch Productions stated in an interview that \"We're broadening ourselves a little bit, taking on some new challenges,\" but also noted that \"I think it's extremely likely that you'll see us return to the \"Sly Cooper\" franchise at some point in the future\". Nate Fox, one of the game designers for Sucker Punch Productions, also stated in a phone interview when questioned about it that he'd love to make another \"Sly\" game, adding to the possibility of a sequel. An Easter egg found in the Sucker Punch game \"Infamous\" shows a movie called \"Sly Cooper 4\" on the building's marquee; there is also a \"Sly Cooper\" symbol on Cole's backpack and back of his pants. Upon completing all three games as part of \"The Sly Collection\" for the PlayStation 3, a movie option is enabled within the game's menus.

The text is unusual in apparently containing no attempt at espousing doctrine, and is likely simply to have been a work of literature rather than theology.\n\nThe text consists of a series of extremely long tales of miracles, such as Andrew riding a cloud to where Peter is, and Peter literally putting a camel through the eye of a needle, turning the traditional metaphor (\"it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven\") on its head. The text appears to have been aimed to be a continuation of the \"Acts of Andrew and Matthias\" (which was a portion of the \"Acts of Andrew\" that was sometimes found as a separate work).\n\n"}

The Hills Hoist and similar rotary clothes hoists remain a common fixture in many backyards in Australia and New Zealand. They are considered one of Australia's most recognisable icons, and are used frequently by artists as a metaphor for Australian suburbia in the 1950s and 1960s. The opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics featured a sequence with giant Hills Hoist robots roaming around the arena. Although originally a product name, the term \"Hills Hoist\" became synonymous with rotary clothes hoists and clothes line in general, throughout Australia.\n\nAs early as 1895 Colin Stewart and Allan Harley of Sun Foundry in Adelaide applied for a patent for an 'Improved Rotary and Tilting Clothes Drying Rack'. In their design the upper clothes line frame tilted to allow access to the hanging lines. Gilbert Toyne of Geelong patented, manufactured and marketed four rotary clothes hoists designs between 1911 and 1946. Toyne's first patented clothes hoist was sold through the Aeroplane Clothes Hoist Company established in 1911. It was Toyne's 1926 all-metal rotary clothes hoist (Australian Patent No. 24553/25) with its enclosed crown wheel-and-pinion winding mechanism that defined clothes hoist designs for decades to follow.\n\nProlific South Australian inventor Gerhard ‘Pop’ Kaesler also designed one, giving his wife Mary the privilege of using a rotary clothesline, some two decades before they went into commercial production in Adelaide. A fellow called Lance Hill bought the metre high wooden prototype model and plans from Pop. Lance Hill began to manufacture the Hills rotary clothes hoist in his backyard in 1945. His wife apparently wanted an inexpensive replacement to the line and prop she had for drying clothes, as she had no room on the line due to her growing lemon tree.\nLance Hill's brother-in-law Harold Ling returned from the war and joined him to form a partnership in 1946. Ling became the key figure in expanding the production and marketing of the Hills Hoists. In 1947 Hills Hoists began manufacturing a wind-up clothes hoist which was identical to Gilbert Toyne's expired 1925 patent with the crown wheel-and-pinion winding mechanism. Initially the clothes hoists were constructed and sold from Lance Hill's home on Bevington Road, Glenunga. Soon production moved to a nearby site on Glen Osmond Road and within a decade the factory had relocated to a larger site at Edwardstown. The company Hills Hoists became Hills Industries in 1958.\n\nA Darwin family reported that the only thing left standing after Cyclone Tracy was their Hills Hoist. The Hills Hoist is listed as a National Treasure by the National Library of Australia. In January 2017, Hills Industries sold the manufacturing and sale rights of its Hills Home Living brands to AMES Australasia, a subsidiary of the American Griffon Corporation.\n\nAs of 2018 Austral ClothesHoists and Daytek Australia are the only Australian manufacturers of rotary clotheslines.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1864948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864948", "title": "Thomas William Holmes", "text": "Thomas William Holmes\n\nThomas William Holmes VC (14 October 1898 – 4 January 1950) was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, during the First World War. Holmes is the youngest Canadian to ever win the Victoria Cross.\n\nAlthough Holmes was born in Montreal, Quebec, his family was from Owen Sound, Ontario. His father's work had taken them to Montreal; however, they returned to Owen Sound when Tommy was about six years old. During his last year of school, he worked for the butcher J.R. Boyd, and just before enlisting Holmes was working on the farm of Templeton Day at nearby Annan, Ontario.\n\nOn 20 December 1915, No. 838301 Tommy Holmes enlisted as a private soldier in the 147th (Grey) Battalion, CEF, at Owen Sound in Grey County. The 147th Battalion was raised by the Grey Regiment, which also later raised the 248th Battalion, CEF. As was common practice at the time, Tommy lied about his age - he was actually 17 years old when he joined-up. He was sworn-in by the 147th Grey Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel G.H. McFarland. \n\nPrior to embarking for England, the battalion trained at Camps Niagara and Borden (today CFB Borden) in Ontario, and at Amherst, Nova Scotia. The battalion was at Camp Borden from 4 July 1916 until 5 October 1916, when it departed for Halifax. Embarkation was delayed, leading to the 147th encamping at Amherst. Finally, on 20 November 1916, Tommy Holmes arrived with the 147th (Grey) Battalion at Liverpool, England. The 147th had sailed in RMS Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic. Like the other 35 CEF battalions that trained at the newly opened Camp Borden in that hot summer of 1916, the 147th (Grey) Battalion was broken-up for reinforcements to units already in the field. Consequently, Tommy Holmes was transferred to the 8th Reserve (Holding) Battalion on 1 February 1917, and then to the 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles on 16 February 1917. \n\nIn April 1917 during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, he received a through-and-through bullet wound from a machinegun in his arm and was temporarily invalided to England. While in hospital, he met up with his older brother Roy, who had enlisted earlier in the 58th Battalion, CEF and who had also been wounded, losing an eye.\n\nHolmes was 19 years old, when as a private serving with the 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles, Canadian Expeditionary Force, he won the Victoria Cross. On 26 October 1917 near Passchendaele, Belgium, he performed a deed for which King George V awarded Tommy the Victoria Cross:\n\"when the right flank of the Canadian attack was held up by heavy machine-gun fire from a pill-box strong point and heavy casualties were producing a critical situation, Private Holmes, on his own initiative and single-handed, ran forward and threw two bombs, killing and wounding the crews of two machine-guns. He then fetched another bomb and threw this into the entrance of the pill-box, causing the 19 occupants to surrender.\"\n\nIt was during the investiture at Buckingham Palace that Holmes admitted to King George V that he had lied about his age and joined the army at age 17.\n\nSergeant Tommy Holmes, VC, returned to Owen Sound after the war to great fanfare and receiving a hero's welcome. On 16 September 1919, he was chosen to be part of the Colour Party for the laying-up of the 147th (Grey) Battalion, CEF Colours in the Carnegie Library, Owen Sound.\n\nAfter the war Holmes was a pilot for the Harbour Commission for fifteen years. In 1936 he and another officer saved the lives of three persons whose auxiliary cabin boat upset in the harbour. In 1935 his home was robbed and the Victoria Cross was stolen. In 1942 Holmes narrowly escaped death when his launch exploded.\n\nHolmes died of cancer on 4 January 1950 and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Owen Sound, Ontario, on 7 January 1950 with full military honours. His memorial service was attended by Victoria Cross winners Henry Howey Robson, Colin Fraser Barron and Walter Leigh Rayfield. Annually on Remembrance Day, a firing party from The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, which perpetuates the 147th (Grey) Battalion, CEF, fires a volley over his grave. Of significance is that two other VC winners are also buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Air Marshal Billy Bishop and Major David Vivian Currie.\n\nA replica of Thomas Holmes VC medal is now on display at the Owen Sound Royal Canadian Legion Branch #6.\n\nIn the 1986, the Owen Sound Armoury, being the Grey County home of The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, was renamed the \"Tommy Holmes, VC, Memorial Armoury.\"\n\n\n"}

It roughly comprises the corridor along the Red River of the North. The Research Corridor is anchored by North Dakota State University (NDSU) and the University of North Dakota (UND). The corridor was established in 2002 by United States Senator Byron Dorgan in an effort to draw research dollars to the state. Since that year, Dorgan has helped to direct $300 million to research in the corridor.\n\nAreas of research at North Dakota State University include nanoscale science and engineering, microsensors (RFID tags), polymers and coatings, agriculture, combinatorial science, and spintronics. Research at NDSU includes the annual $100+ million NDSU research budget, $78.4 million in annual outlays, $234.9 million in annual direct and secondary impacts, as well as research budgets from other enterprises that are a part of the research park. Many of the research projects at NDSU use federally backed grants, including several from the United States Department of Defense.\n\nThe NDSU Research and Technology Park is a 55-acre (223,000 m²) site of innovation and technology; the site sits adjacent to the main NDSU campus. The Research and Technology Park is a public/private partnership between NDSU and private enterprises. As of 2006, the research park employed 511.

The University's agreement with NASA is valued at $25 million. The aircraft's areas of research include tracking pollution, monitoring the hole in the ozone layer, and studying the atmosphere's chemistry.\n\nOne feature of the research park is the Center for Technology Enterprise. The Center is a . building that serves the needs of entrepreneurial endeavors. The center offers venture capital, networking and technical advice, as well as supply services, among others. The building offers wet and dry labs, tenant space, production/manufacturing areas, as well as internet/computer capabilities suitable for expansive research and development. One of the building's major tenants is the Bobcat Company.\n\nResearch at both NDSU and UND has an economic impact on the state of North Dakota. A 2007 study showed that research at UND had a statewide economic impact of $135.7 million. The same study showed that UND research generated a total of 1,649 jobs, of which 728 were on campus. Another 2007 study showed that research at NDSU had a statewide economic impact of $100 million.

Underway again 18 August, she put in at San Diego, California, 22 December and decommissioned there in March 1920. Remaining in the Reserve Destroyer Force until 10 September 1921, she sailed from San Diego that date for the Puget Sound Navy Yard. \"Greene\" returned shortly thereafter to San Francisco, California, arriving 2 December 1921, and decommissioned there 17 June 1922.\n\nRecommissioned 28 June 1940 at San Diego, \"Greene\" was towed to San Francisco and was redesignated AVD-13 6 April 1941 following conversion. She sailed 27 April for the Caribbean and conducted training and tended seaplanes off Puerto Rico and Bermuda.\n\nOne week after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, \"Greene\" sailed for Brazil. Until the summer of 1942 she served as seaplane tender at Natal with one call at Rio de Janeiro for repairs in February 1942. She returned to Charleston, South Carolina 18 July 1942. She escorted a convoy from Norfolk, Virginia to Bermuda and operated in the South Atlantic for the next 6 months as a convoy escort, making two voyages to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBack at Norfolk 26 February 1943, she steamed from there to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, to operate with , one of the new escort carriers designed to hunt German submarines in the North Atlantic. Both warships sailed 23 April to escort a convoy to Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland, and made the eastward passage without incident. On the return leg of the voyage, however, one of the first major engagements between carrier-based aircraft and submarines attempting a rendezvous for mass attack occurred 21 May – 22 May, when \"Bogue\"s planes made six attacks on submarines and sank in 50-40 N., 35-21 W. Twenty-four Germans were captured. During a second antisubmarine patrol from 31 May to 20 June 1943, \"Bogue\" and her escorts, including \"Greene\", sank further submarines: 5 June in 30-18 N., 42-50 W., and in 30-49 N., 33-49 W. one week later. For these two successful antisubmarine operations \"Greene\" received the Presidential Unit Citation. The \"Bogue\" group was the first of a series of offensive antisubmarine warfare patrols in response to the U-Boat assault in the Atlantic.\n\nSubsequently, until the fall of 1943, \"Greene\" escorted a fast troop convoy from Norfolk to the United Kingdom and return, and operated off Bermuda.

He was a prolific composer of band music, his best-known composition being \"The Whistler and His Dog\". In later life, he became a Democratic Party politician from New Jersey, who served on the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders during the 1930s.\n\nHe was born on September 22, 1869 on the second floor of the Lyceum Theater in Saint Joseph, Missouri. He was the son of Samuel Pryor, bandmaster and founder of the original Pryor band, and his wife. Arthur first took up music at a very young age under the tutelage of his father and was playing the valve trombone by age 11. The story goes that whenever he hit a sour note while practicing, his father planted a resounding crack on his head with a violin bow. The boy developed until he was so skilled that he won a place in the John Philip Sousa's band. He was hailed as a prodigy after this.\n\nPryor went on to direct the Stanley Opera Company in Denver, Colorado until joining the John Philip Sousa Band in 1892. He played his first solo with the Sousa Band at age 22 during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During his 12 years with the Sousa Band, Pryor estimated that he played 10,000 solos. From 1895 to 1903, Pryor was assistant conductor of the Sousa Band. During his association with the \"March King\", Pryor toured throughout the USA and Europe. While in Europe, he entertained King Edward VII of England and Czar Nicholas II of Russia with his trombone solos. Once while in Germany, all the trombonists of the German Army bands were ordered to hear him play. They were so amazed at his playing that they insisted on taking his trombone apart, refusing to believe that it was natural. Finally one German said: \"No one can play so well. It is a Yankee trick.\"\n\nIn 1902 after the death of his father, Pryor ended his association with Sousa and took over the reorganized Pryor band; he led its debut at the Majestic Theatre in New York City on November 15, 1903. For 30 years thereafter, Pryor's band was an American institution. He made his first appearance in Asbury Park, New Jersey at the Shore in 1904, where he continued to play until 1930. The Pryor Band toured until 1909, when he decided to settle down and make Asbury Park the home of the band. Also at this time, he became a staff conductor and arranger for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. He organized a second band that played at the entertainment complex of Coney Island, New York, for a number of years.\n\nPryor retired from full-time conducting in 1933. On November 7 of that year, he and Henry W. Herbert were elected to the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders, defeating Director Bryant B. Newcomb and his running mate, Arthur Johnson. Pryor and Herbert would each serve one, three-year term in office. In the 1936 election, they were defeated by Republicans J. Russell Woolley and Edgar O. Murphy.\n\nPryor was married to Maude Russell Pryor. Their son Roger Pryor (1901–1974) also became a bandleader and a film actor. They also had sons Arthur Jr., who became a bandsman and advertising executive, and Samuel Pryor.\n\nThe senior Pryor suffered a stroke on June 17, 1942, and died on June 18 at his home in West Long Branch, New Jersey. Funeral services were conducted June 21, 1942, at the Trinity Episcopal Church, Asbury Park, followed by burial in Glenwood Cemetery, West Long Branch.\n\nPryor composed some 300 works, including marches, novelties, tone poems and three light operas, \"Jinga Boo\", \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and \"On the Eve of Her Wedding Day\". Among his best-known numbers were \"On Jersey Shore\", \"Queen Titania\" and \"The Whistler and His Dog\". He set to work on an opera titled \"Peter and Paul\", with a libretto by L. Frank Baum; the libretto has been lost. It was intended to star Fred Stone and David Montgomery in several roles in several time periods.\n\nDuring his career, Pryor wrote some of today's most well-known trombone literature, including an arrangement of the heralded \"Bluebells of Scotland\", as well as band novelty works such as \"The Whistler and His Dog\", with its piccolo solo, his best-known composition. Much of this literature has been recorded by Ian Bousfield on his CD \"Pryor Engagement\" (Doyen DOY CD212).\n\nIn 1985, thousands of early Pryor scores were discovered by conductor Rick Benjamin. He has played many of Pryor's compositions with his Paragon Ragtime Orchestra.\n\n"}

(stylized as CineMark) is an American movie theater chain owned by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. operating throughout the Americas and in Taiwan. It is headquartered in Plano, Texas, in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. It is the largest movie theatre chain in Brazil, with a 30 percent market share.\n\nCinemark operates theaters under several brands, including its flagship Cinemark, Century Theatres, Tinseltown USA, CinéArts, and Rave Cinemas.\n\nCinemark was started by Lee Roy Mitchell as a chain of theatres in California, Texas, and Utah. It is unclear when Cinemark was first founded. While Cinemark officially claims to have launched in 1984 (and previously claimed a 1983 founding date), online records show Cinemark might have started as early as 1977. The roots of the company date back to the 1960s when brothers J.C. and Lee Roy Mitchell created Mitchell Theatres, Inc. By 1972, the company was named Texas Cinema Corporation. Lee Roy Mitchell then formed a group of theaters under the Cinemark name beginning in 1977. Cinemark Corporation and Texas Cinema Corporation merged operations in June of 1979 creating a portfolio of 25 theaters in Texas and New Mexico under the Cinemark brand. \n\nWith the opening of the Movies 8 on 3912 Hampton Road in Texarkana, Texas in 1987, Cinemark began building theaters with colorful interiors and large video game arcades. The following year, Cinemark introduced its Front Row Joe mascot. This animated cat appeared in policy trailers and on kids' concession products. The mascot was retired in 1998 when Cinemark had begun to open Art Deco-style theatres, and was revived in 2002. In 1992, Cinemark opened a new theater concept called Hollywood USA in Garland, Texas. The following year, Cinemark expanded to Latin America with the opening of a theater in Santiago, Chile. The next year, Cinemark opened four theaters in Mexico. In 1998, Cinemark announced that it would replace its bright color interiors with what Cinemark characterized as a more classic Art Deco design. Through new theatre construction and acquisitions, it became the third largest theatre chain in the United States and the second largest theatre chain in the world. Mitchell's son Kevin Mitchell worked with the company as an executive until leaving in 2007 to found ShowBiz Cinemas. In 2013, Cinemark decided to sell all of its Mexican theaters to Cinemex.\n\nIn the 1990s, Cinemark Theatres was one of the first chains to incorporate stadium-style seating into their theatres. In 1997, several disabled individuals filed a lawsuit against Cinemark, alleging that their stadium style seats forced patrons who used wheelchairs to sit in the front row of the theatre, effectively rendering them unable to see the screen without assuming a horizontal position. The case was heard in El Paso district court as \"Lara v. Cinemark USA\", where a judge ruled that the architecture of Cinemark's theatres violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ruling was later overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Cinemark only had to provide an \"unobstructed view\" of the screen, and that since disabled patrons' view was only awkward and not actually obscured, Cinemark was not violating the law.\n\nIn response, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed their own suit against Cinemark while appealing the appellate court's decision. The DOJ argued that, while Cinemark was not technically violating the ADA, it was nevertheless discriminating against disabled patrons by relegating them to the worst seats in the auditorium. Cinemark responded by filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging misconduct on the DOJ's behalf. Cinemark's lawsuit was thrown out, and the Department of Justice proceeded with its lawsuit. Cinemark ultimately agreed to settle out of court before the court came to a ruling, agreeing with the DOJ that it was in the company's best interest to end litigation before a ruling was issued. Per the terms of the settlement, Cinemark agreed to renovate all existing theatres to provide patrons who used wheelchairs access to rows higher in its theatres, and also agreed that all future theatres would be constructed so as to allow handicapped patrons better access to higher rows. In turn, the Department of Justice agreed not to bring further litigation against the company in relation to the architecture of stadium seating as it applies to the ADA.\n\nOn July 20, 2012, a gunman opened fire during the midnight premiere of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in a Century theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. The gunman, later identified as James Eagan Holmes, who was believed to be acting alone, entered the theater dressed in protective clothing, set off tactical grenades, then opened fire with multiple firearms on the theatergoers. Counting both fatalities and injuries, the attack was the largest mass shooting in terms of number of casualties in United States history at the time. The theater was reopened on January 17, 2013.\n\nThe theater was sued by families of the victims, who alleged the theater should have taken greater measures to prevent the such a shooting. In May 2016, after years of legal debate, a jury took three hours to deliver a unanimous verdict that the theater chain was not liable to any degree for the tragedy that transpired. As the prevailing party in the judgement, Cinemark sought nearly US$700,000 from the plaintiffs to recover litigation expenses. In September 2016, after objections from the victims, Cinemark dropped all claims for reimbursement of legal fees. A separate group of victims were also dismissed in federal court when US District Judge R. Brooke Jackson ruled: \"[James Holmes'] own premeditated and intentional actions were the predominant cause of the plaintiffs' losses.\"\n\nIn the wake of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Cinemark announced that it would no longer allow bags larger than in its theaters as a safety precaution.\n\nEffective March 18, 2020, Cinemark closed all of its 345 theaters across the United States indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cinemark released a statement describing the temporary closure \"as a proactive measure in support of the health and safety of its employees, guests and communities.\"\n\nIn 2008, CEO Alan Stock donated US$9,999 toward the successful passage of California's Proposition 8, an initiative restricting the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples and overturning the California Supreme Court's ruling that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. An ensuing campaign, launched by opponents to the Prop 8 passage, encouraged patrons to see the Gus Van Sant film \"Milk\", starring Sean Penn in the title role of gay-rights activist Harvey Milk, at a competing theater in protest. Others called for a more general boycott.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that company founder Lee Roy Mitchell was \"solidly\" supporting the reelection campaign of US Senator and former presidential candidate Ted Cruz, and that Mitchell and his wife Tandy had donated $1 million to a pro-Cruz Super-PAC.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, Cinemark purchased Century Theatres with a combination of cash and stock bonds. This acquisition added over 80 theatres and many more screens. Some of these theatres were subsequently shut down either being phased out as under performing or replaced with new complexes. The transaction was completed on October 5, 2006. With this purchase, Cinemark heavily strengthened their presence in Northern California and entered Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, and Washington state, though at the transaction both of their locations in Washington state were still under construction. However, Cinemark retains the Century banner and continues to open new locations under that banner.\n\nIn 2009, in order to save the company from a potential bankruptcy, Muvico Theaters sold four theatres to Cinemark: Arundel Mills Egyptian 24 in Hanover, Maryland; Paradise 24 in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Palace 20 in Boca Raton, Florida; and Boynton Beach 14 in Boynton Beach, Florida.\n\nIn November 2012 Cinemark announced it was acquiring Rave Cinemas, the Dallas, Texas–based chain that operates the former Bridge theater with IMAX in Culver City, California for US$240 million. The deal included 32 theaters located in 12 US states, representing 483 screens. Tim Warner, Cinemark's CEO said in a statement \"The acquisition of these high quality assets will further enhance Cinemark's diversified domestic footprint, including the expansion of our presence in the New England market\". The sale was closed on May 29, 2013, but Cinemark was required to sell the Rave Stonybrook 20 + IMAX theater in Louisville, Kentucky, the Rave Ritz Center 16 in southern New Jersey, and either the Rave Hickory Creek 16 in Hickory Creek, Texas or the Cinemark 14 in Denton, Texas. In addition, Cinemark's chairman Lee Roy Mitchell was also required to sell the Movie Tavern Inc. to Southern Theatres. On July 18, 2013, Cinemark found a buyer, Carmike Cinemas, for the Stonybrook 20 & IMAX, Rave Ritz Center 16, and the Rave Hickory Creek 16. With this change, National CineMedia has been replaced with Screenvision at the Stonybrook 20 and Ritz Center 16. Screenvision is already at Hickory Creek, Texas at the time of the announcement of the sale. The sale was closed on August 16, 2013. On September 12, 2013, Southern Theatres announced that they acquired The Movie Tavern from Lee Roy Mitchell after he was required to sell The Movie Tavern after Cinemark bought Rave Cinemas on May 29, 2013. In 2018, Southern sold the Movie Tavern chain to the Marcus Corporation. As part of Southern Theatres' long-term deal with National CineMedia, The Movie Tavern switched from Screenvision to National CineMedia in June 2014. Also, Cinemark purchased Rave Cinemas Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 15, in Los Angeles, in June 2014.\n\n\n"}

She had been sexually assaulted. The case went unsolved for 33 years. During the early years of their inquiry into the assault and murder, the police persisted in investigating one particular suspect, finally charging him in 1979, but he was released in 1980 for lack of evidence.\n\nIn 2008, Jerome Sydney Barrett – not the person they had pursued in the 1970s – was charged with the assault and murder of Marcia Trimble, after DNA evidence recovered from her remains linked him to the crime. Barrett had been arrested just days after Trimble's disappearance, on suspicion of the sexual assault of a local university student, and was still in jail when Trimble's sexually assaulted body was found. Despite this and his convictions for attacks on other women and children, police had not investigated him in relation to Trimble's murder. On July 18, 2009, a jury convicted him for Trimble's sexual assault and murder, and he was sentenced to 44 years in prison.\n\nTrimble's murder occurred soon after two other crimes:\n\nMarcia Trimble disappeared while delivering Girl Scout Cookies in her neighborhood. The case was investigated by local and state police. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) joined the case due to the possibility of kidnapping. Trimble's body was discovered more than a month later. It was found that she had been sexually assaulted before being killed.\n\nInvestigators searched the neighborhood, believing it likely that the murderer was a local resident. Police attention soon focused on Jeffrey Womack, a 15-year-old boy who lived near Marcia's home. Womack was one of the last people to see her alive.\n\nMarcia had come to Womack's house the day of her disappearance. Womack said that he had sent her away because he did not have money to buy cookies. He said that, after he learned of the girl's disappearance, he went to her house to tell the police there what he knew. According to Womack, the police aggressively questioned him and then made him empty out his pockets. Inside the pockets, police found a half roll of pennies, a five-dollar bill, and a condom. This seemed to contradict Womack's testimony that he lacked the money to pay Marcia. The condom suggested to police that he may have sexually abused Marcia. Womack later said that he had the condom because he was having a sexual relationship with a local woman.\n\nAccording to Womack, his mother and a neighbor found out that the police were questioning him and insisted that any further interrogation must be done with a lawyer present.\n\nReporter Demetria Kalodimos believed that Womack's decision to call a lawyer made police more suspicious of him. They felt that an innocent person had no need of a lawyer. Womack's attorney, John Hollins, advised him to stop cooperating with police. After that, Womack refused to discuss the case with either the police or the media.\n\nUnable to obtain a confession, the police resorted to other means to try and gather evidence against Womack. When Womack was 17 years old and working as a bus boy in a restaurant, the police sent an undercover officer into the restaurant to befriend him, but they did not get any incriminating evidence. Womack passed two polygraph tests. In 1980, authorities finally arrested him for Marcia Trimble's murder, but the charge was dismissed for lack of evidence. Many police officers involved in the case continued to believe that he was guilty.\n\nDNA samples were taken from semen collected from Marcia's body, but these samples were stored improperly and deteriorated over time, limiting investigators' ability to identify or exclude suspects. Police collected DNA samples from 96 suspects, including Womack, but none of these samples matched the DNA found in the semen.\n\nInvestigators said they believed more than one man's semen was found inside Marcia's body. Semen also was found on her clothes. Investigators believed Marcia had been lured into a garage and killed there. Her body was found fully clothed next to bags of fertilizer in the garage. Despite having been lying there for a month, there was little decomposition, due to the cool, dry environment.\n\nThe cause of death was determined to be strangulation because Marcia had suffered a broken hyoid bone.\n\nPolice found it difficult to determine how many people were involved in the crime. They believed the perpetrator was a juvenile and someone Marcia knew. Dirt that was found on her shoe was mainly upon the sole, indicating that she had walked into the garage, and had not been dragged into it.\n\nSemen was found on the girl's blouse and pants but not on her underwear. Semen was also found in her vagina, but there was no other sign of rape or penetration. Investigators believed Marcia's attacker was either an adolescent boy or a man with a very small penis. DNA tests seemed to indicate there was semen from as many as four different attackers. One investigator doubted this because the samples had been poorly preserved. \"I'm not confident in the DNA sample that we've got,\" Nashville homicide detective Tommy Jacobs said.\n\nIn 2001, a local paper interviewed Police Captain Mickey Miller, former homicide detective Tommy Jacobs of the Nashville Police, and former FBI agent Richard Knudsen about the unsolved Trimble case. Each had a different theory about what had happened on the evening when Trimble disappeared.\n\nCaptain Miller said that while Trimble was killed in the garage where she was found, that may not have been where she was sexually assaulted. Miller thought that Trimble might have been sexually assaulted at a tree nursery which became part of the investigation. Citing DNA evidence, he also believed that she was sexually assaulted by up to three boys.\n\nJacobs was not sure that Marcia left her home to deliver cookies to Marie Maxwell. He suggested she might have been planning to meet up with Womack. Jacobs said he thought that someone Marcia knew lured her into the garage. He did not know if it was Womack or just an \"adolescent teenager with his hormones blitzing.\" \"The suspect just raped someone. It was probably a new experience for him, and it was a new experience for Marcia. It was a tense situation. Marcia screamed. I don't think the perpetrator wanted to kill her. I think he wanted to gain control of her and make her be quiet.\" In contrast to Miller (his former boss), Jacobs did not believe that Marcia was sexually assaulted by more than one person.\n\nThe FBI's Knudsen posed a different theory. He said that Marcia had walked to Marie Maxwell's home as the woman was pulling into her driveway. Given the timing, Marcia could not have known that Maxwell was returning home unless someone had called to tell her. Just minutes earlier, Maxwell had parked her car in front of a neighbor's driveway to ask a quick question. That house was across the street from the Womack and Morgan homes. If Jeffrey Womack was home during that time, or if he was at Peggy Morgan's house, he could have seen Maxwell's car and called to Marcia. Knudsen placed Womack at the driveway with Marcia.\n\nThe three investigators' theories varied widely, but they concluded that whoever killed Marcia most likely was a juvenile who lived in the neighborhood.\n\nOn June 6, 2008, a Davidson County Grand Jury indicted 60-year-old Jerome Sydney Barrett, charging him with first-degree murder and felony in the case of Marcia Trimble. Barrett had formerly been indicted and convicted for other assaults against women and children. At the time of Marcia's murder, Barrett was working in her neighborhood.\n\nBarrett first took responsibility for the 1975 murder during a private conversation on the rooftop of the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center. During questioning, \"He said he did not rape her. He killed her.\" \"He said his DNA was on her, but not in her.\" Barrett once again claimed to have killed Marcia immediately after he had had an altercation with another jail inmate. It was during this altercation, the convict said, that Barrett claimed to have killed \"four blue-eyed bitches.\"\n\nJournalists revealed that, for more than a decade, investigators had concealed the fact that DNA evidence excluded numerous neighbors as potential suspects. A retired police detective admitted that the men were excluded and that they had not been told of the fact.\n\nIn the early years of the investigation, the use of DNA evidence was new, and investigators did not thoroughly understand its implications. Investigators were not sure the DNA evidence was conclusive for excluding suspects. In addition, detectives admitted to careless handling of Marcia's body, stating that they simply cut her blouse and pants off in the shed without wearing protective gloves.\n\n\nResidents were upset by the fact that the victim was a child, and that the crime took place in an affluent neighborhood. This was at a time when people felt that their children were safe.\n\nThe delay in finding and recovering the girl's body also disturbed people. FBI agents were brought in to assist with the investigation.\n\nAfter Womack's release in 1980, residents continued to be haunted by this unsolved murder. Each year, Nashville media highlighted the story on the anniversary of Marcia's disappearance or of the discovery of her body. The case marked a time of great change in how news was covered by local media, and in the emerging importance of DNA evidence (not well understood in earlier years).\n\nNashville Police Captain Mickey Miller said of the case:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1865004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865004", "title": "Creditanstalt", "text": "Creditanstalt\n\nCreditanstalt (sometimes Credit-Anstalt, abbreviated as CA) was an Austrian bank based in Vienna.\n\nIn 1820, Salomon Mayer von Rothschild established the first bank in Vienna, then the capital of the Austrian Empire. In the course of early industrialisation, the Rothschild bank financed large development projects, such as the building of the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway to the Moravian mining regions. Rothschild also acted as a generous lender to Austrian state chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich and granted copious credits to the Bohemian and Hungarian aristocracy.\n\nThe \"Creditanstalt\" was founded in 1855 by Rothschild's son, Anselm, as the \"K. k. priv. Österreichische Credit-Anstalt für Handel und Gewerbe\" (approximate translation: Imperial royal privileged Austrian Credit Institute for Commerce and Industry). Being very successful, it soon became the largest bank in Austria-Hungary.\n\nAnselm's son, Albert, took control of the \"Credit-Anstalt\" in 1872 and was succeeded in 1911 by his son, Louis. In 1912, the firm's new headquarters in Vienna's \"Innere Stadt\" opened in a lavishly decorated Neoclassical building, which is still preserved to the present day.\n\nThe business situation dramatically changed with Austria's defeat in the First World War and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and empire. In the late 1920s, a principal debtor, the Steyr-Werke AG, faced financial difficulties, with bad loans leading to a drain on finances. In October 1929, the Schober government compelled the allegedly well-financed \"Credit-Anstalt\" to assume liabilities, which together with the simultaneous Wall Street Crash led to the financial imbalance of the then-largest Austrian credit provider.\n\n\"Creditanstalt\" had to declare bankruptcy on 11 May 1931. This was one of the first major bank failures that initiated the Great Depression. In fact, the failure of the \"Creditanstalt\" is what sent shockwaves throughout Europe, quickly spreading the Great Depression. However, Chancellor Otto Ender rescued \"Creditanstalt\" by distributing the enormous share of costs between the Republic, Austria's central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Rothschild family. Nationalization plans advanced by the Social Democrats were rejected. However, the institute was \"de facto\" state-owned after Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß in 1934 ordered the merger of the institute with the \"Wiener Bankverein\", thus changing its name to \"Creditanstalt-Bankverein\". The firm's bankruptcy and its impact in producing a major global banking crisis provided a major propaganda opportunity for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party: it allowed them to further blame Jews for German and international economic and social troubles.\n\nFollowing the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, \"Creditanstalt-Bankverein\" was targeted for both financial and racial reasons. Louis de Rothschild was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the losses suffered by the Austrian state when the bank collapsed. Deprived of his position and property, he migrated to the U.S. in 1939 after more than one year in custody.\n\n\"Creditanstalt-Bankverein\" was later taken over by Deutsche Bank, patronized by Hermann Josef Abs. Though CEO Josef Joham made contact with the Office of Strategic Services, \"Creditanstalt\" also settled the financial issues of several Nazi concentration camps as well as the \"Aryanization\" of Jewish-owned businesses, like the re-establishment of Sascha-Film as Wien-Film Limited.\n\nAfter World War II, the bank was nationalised by Allied-occupied Austria in 1946. It became mainly a commercial bank and was highly involved in Austria's economy, holding stakes in important Austrian companies such as Wienerberger, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, Lenzing AG and Semperit. From 1956 onwards, \"Creditanstalt\" was again partly privatised by issuing 40% in shares, though only 10% in common stock.\n\nIn 1981, the former Social Democratic Minister of Finance Hannes Androsch assumed the office of a general manager, after he had left the Kreisky cabinet. Industrial interests were reduced, while the government ownership share fell to 51%. In the 1980s, \"Creditanstalt\" opened branches in London, New York and Hong Kong, while the international orientation towards East-Central Europe was boosted by the fall of the Iron Curtain upon the Revolutions of 1989. Nevertheless, after several difficult lending operations, \"Creditanstalt\" became an acquisition candidate.\n\nIn 1997, the state-owned shares were sold to Bank Austria (BA), resulting in a crisis in the ruling coalition between the Social Democratic Party and the conservative Austrian People's Party, since \"Creditanstalt\" was considered to be part of the conservative sphere of influence, whereas BA with its roots as Red Vienna's Central Savings Bank (\"Zentralsparkasse\") was considered to be on the political left.\n\nThe merger was not completed until 2002, with the creation of \"Bank Austria Creditanstalt\" (BA-CA), which became part of the German HypoVereinsbank (HVB) group. In 2005, HVB was taken over by the Italian holding company UniCredit. After 153 years, the bank name \"Creditanstalt\" was finally erased in 2008, but it survived in the \"CA Immo\" subsidiary.\n\n\n\n"}

Her mother and father had both served in the army during the Second World War, and later, her father was a local government clerk. In 1952 the family moved into a new council house in the mining village of [[Newarthill]], where her sister was born in 1957. Though she was encouraged by her teachers to study English, Lochhead was determined to go to [[Glasgow School of Art]] where she studied between 1965 and 1970. After graduation Lochhead taught art at High Schools in Glasgow and Bristol, a career at which she says she was \"terrible\"\n\nHaving written poetry as a child and whilst studying at Art School, Liz Lochhead won a BBC Scotland Poetry Competition in 1971 and Gordon Wright published her first collection of Poetry, \"Memo For Spring\" in 1972 under his Reprographia imprint.\n\nIt is often claimed that at this time Lochhead was part of a [[Philip Hobsbaum]] writers' group, a crucible of creative activity – with other members including [[Alasdair Gray]], [[James Kelman]], [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]], [[Aonghas MacNeacail]] and [[Jeff Torrington]], Liz Lochhead has repeatedly claimed this to be an invention. She has however recalled the support and inspiration she drew from the Scottish poetry scene of the early 1970s and meetings with the elder generation - [[Norman MacCaig]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Robert Garioch]] - and with contemporaries such as Leonard, Kelman and Gray. Lochhead went on to produce revue shows with Leonard and Gray, including Tickly Mince, and The Pie of Damocles.

In addition, Jacobs oversaw the design of the various women's licensees. In 1992, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awarded Jacobs with The Women's Designer of the Year Award. In the same year, he designed a \"grunge\" collection for Perry Ellis, leading to his dismissal.\n\nIn the fall of 1993, Jacobs Duffy Designs Inc. launched their own licensing and design company, Marc Jacobs International Company, L.P. In 1994, Jacobs produced his first full collection of menswear. In 1997, Jacobs was appointed Louis Vuitton's creative director, where he created the company's first ready-to-wear clothing line. Jacobs has collaborated with many popular artists for his Louis Vuitton collections, including Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami and most recently American artist Richard Prince and rapper Kanye West,\nIn the spring of 2001, Jacobs introduced his secondary line, Marc by Marc Jacobs. In 2005, Look was the Marc by Marc Jacobs ready-to-wear license holder in Japan with retail value of €50 million. In 2006, Jacobs started a new line of body-splash fragrances in ten-ounce bottles which are distributed by Coty. First being sold only in perfume boutiques, they have become more and more popular. In 2007 filmmaker Loïc Prigent released a documentary film about Jacobs entitled \"Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton\". In February 2008, Jacobs was accused of plagiarizing a scarf design created in the 1950s by Swedish designer Gösta Olofsson. Jacobs settled the matter by offering monetary compensation to Olofsson's son. In 2009, Jacobs launched a shirt, sold at his stores, demanding the legalization of gay marriage. In May 2009, Jacobs co-hosted, with fashion model Kate Moss, a \"model and muse\"-themed gala for the New York City Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.\n\nIn February 2010, Jacobs sued Ed Hardy for infringing on the designs of one of his embroidered handbags. In the course of the Mercedes-Benz Berlin Fashion Week in July 2011 Jacobs was the patron of the young talent award \"Designer for Tomorrow by Peek & Cloppenburg\". The five finalists were selected by Jacob and the juryboard and received a personal coaching by Jacobs. The juryboard and Jacobs appointed the winner of 2011 during the DfT award show. In August 2011, it was reported that Jacobs may succeed John Galliano as creative director of Christian Dior. According to \"The Daily Telegraph\", Jacobs \"firmly laid to rest rumours that he was to move to Christian Dior\" in January 2012, but rumours prevail.\n\nIn February 2013, Jacobs was named the new creative director for Diet Coke. In honor of the brand's 30th anniversary, Jacobs would spend one year where he was slated to give the brand a \"stylish and light-hearted\" makeover. In March 2013, the New York Daily News revealed that the \"faux fur\" used in many Marc Jacobs garments is actually the fur from raccoon dogs from China.\n\nIn October 2013, after the Spring/Summer 2014 show, it was revealed that Marc Jacobs would leave Louis Vuitton to focus on his own line.\n\nOn January 9, 2014 it was announced that Jacobs's new Spring/Summer collection would feature actress/singer Miley Cyrus, photographed by David Sims.\n\nOn February 26, 2014, it was announced that actress Jessica Lange would be the new face of \"Marc Jacobs Beauty\". In addition, it was announced that Lange would be featured in the brand's Summer/Fall print-ad campaign photographed by David Sims, and would also star in a short campaign film directed by Jacobs, to start streaming online May 5, 2014. Previously, Jacobs had dressed and interviewed Lange for \"Love Magazine\"'s fifth anniversary issue, and had her provide a spoken-word version of Happy Days Are Here Again as the soundtrack for his Autumn/Winter 2014 show.\n\nFor the first time Marc Jacobs decided to rely on social media to cast models for Marc by Marc Jacobs's Autumn/Winter 2014 campaign and with its success did so again for Spring/Summer 2015 with photographer David Sims, with models including Aaron Whitty, Abigail Lipp, Amy Woodman, Ana Viktoria, Dylan Stevens, Eb Eunbi, Lindsay Lurgin, MacKenzie Cockerill, Nadia Kishlan, and Toks Adewetan.\n\nIn February 2018, LVMH confirmed that Baja East co-founder John Targon would join Marc Jacobs as \"creative director of contemporary\".\n\nOn August 26, 2019, Jacobs was presented with MTV's first \"Fashion Trailblazer Award\" at the Video Music Awards, in partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America.\nCouncil of Fashion Designers of America:\n\nIn Summer 2013, there were 285 Marc Jacobs retail stores (including Marc by Marc Jacobs & Marc Jacobs Collection) in 60 countries. In December 2013, the new Marc Jacobs flagship store opened in Shanghai.\n\nIn March 2015, Marc Jacobs announced the end of his secondary brand Marc by Marc Jacobs in order to focus on the development of his main label Marc Jacobs and to target to a more luxury-oriented audience.\n\nExplaining his clothes, Jacobs has said \"what I prefer is that even if someone feels hedonistic, they don't look it. Curiosity about sex is much more interesting to me than domination. ... My clothes are not hot. Never. Never.\" The audience for his fashion shows typically includes celebrities like Kim Gordon and Vincent Gallo. Guy Trebay, a critic for \"The New York Times\", in response to Oscar de la Renta's comment that a coat designed by Jacobs closely resembled one that de la Renta had designed thirty years earlier, wrote that \"unlike the many brand-name designers who promote the illusion that their output results from a single prodigious creativity, Mr. Jacobs makes no pretense that fashion emerges full blown from the head of one solitary genius\". Jacobs was one of the first fashion designers to establish this \"street wise aesthetics – a [mash up of] a little preppie, a little grunge, a little couture.\"\nThe Marc Jacobs brand is also known for fine arts driven and avante garde AD campaigns, often featuring a group of cultural icons and artists in lieu of traditional fashion models in minimally staged settings, and photographed by high-profile photographers. In 2015, Jacobs launched a popular lifestyle campaign that featured artists, celebrities, and cultural icons such as Sofia Coppola, Cher, Willow Smith, Winona Ryder, Daisy Lowe, and Anthony Kiedis.\n\nJacobs revisited this approach for the Marc Jacobs Spring 2016 advertising campaign, describing the concept as a fashion story representing a \"series of connected events; a visual narrative. It is a personal diary of people who have and continue to inspire me and open my mind to different ways of seeing and thinking. The spectrum of individuals photographed in our Spring/Summer 2016 ad campaign represent a celebration of my America.\" Adding, \"The people featured in our campaign personify this collection of fashion through their individuality. Collectively, they embody and celebrate the spirit and beauty of equality.\" Dena Silver, from The Observer.com, called it \"the best campaign of the Spring 2016 season.\" She then elaborates about what makes this campaign notable: \"The designer (Marc Jacobs) has handpicked a star studded cast of his family members to model the Americana gear from this collection.\" Adding \"Technically speaking, none of the people in this series of photographs are related to Mr. Jacobs by blood, but rather, they're people who mean a lot to the Marc Jacobs brand.\" The Marc Jacobs Spring 2016 advertising campaign featured Lana Wachowski, Sandra Bernhard, Bette Midler, Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci, Sky Ferreira, Bella Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski as well as lesser known artists Vincent Michaud, Oli Burslem, and Milk, a contestant from RuPaul's Drag Race, as well as several runway models.\n\nJacobs has an ongoing project entitled, \"Protect The Skin You're In\", which has celebrities pose nude, with their breasts and frontal area covered, for T-shirts to raise awareness about melanoma; all sales benefit research at the NYU Langone Medical Center. Some of the celebrities that have posed are Miley Cyrus, Eva Mendes, Kate Upton, Victoria Beckham, Heidi Klum, Hilary Swank, and Naomi Campbell.\n\nOn April 4, 2018, Jacobs proposed to his boyfriend, Charly Defrancesco, via a flashmob while in a Chipotle restaurant. The flashmob did a routine to the song \"Kiss\" by Prince. They were married in a lavish wedding held in New York City on April 7, 2019.\n\nJacobs and Defrancesco purchased a home in Rye, New York in April 2019. The Westchester home was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and is known as the Max Hoffman House.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865101", "title": "Jack McCoy", "text": "Jack McCoy\n\nJohn James McCoy is a fictional character in the television drama \"Law & Order\". He was created by Dick Wolf and Michael S. Chernuchin and portrayed by Sam Waterston from 1994 until the end of the series in 2010. He is the second-longest tenured character on the show (16 seasons), after Lt. Anita Van Buren (17 seasons; portrayed by S. Epatha Merkerson). He appeared in 368 episodes of \"Law & Order\", four episodes of \"\", two episodes of \"\", two episodes of \"\", and the made-for-TV movie \"\".\n\nWaterston's performance as McCoy on the New York–based series was so popular that it resulted in him being declared a \"Living Landmark\" by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with fellow longtime series cast member Jerry Orbach (who portrayed the popular police detective Lennie Briscoe for 12 years).\n\nJack McCoy brings 24 years of experience with him as he is appointed Executive Assistant District Attorney by Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) in the season five premiere episode \"Second Opinion\". He quickly establishes himself as more unconventional and ruthless than his predecessor as Executive Assistant District Attorney, Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty). He often bends—and sometimes breaks—trial rules to get convictions, finds tenuous rationales for charging defendants with crimes when the original charges fail to stick, and charges innocent people to frighten them into testifying against others. McCoy is found in contempt of court 80 times for such behavior, and his tactics occasionally incur negative publicity for the DA's office. His underlying motivation, however, is not, he maintains, corruption, but a sincere desire to see justice done. To that end, McCoy has gone after defendants accused of perverting the justice system to arrange wrongful convictions with just as much determination as his more mundane cases. Such aggressive actions in the courts have earned him the nickname \"Hang 'em High McCoy\". He has subsequently developed a reputation with both colleagues and rival attorneys, once being referred to as \"the top of the legal food chain\" by a rival attorney during a trial.\n\nFollowing the 17th season (2006–2007), Jack McCoy was appointed interim district attorney, taking over from Arthur Branch (Fred Thompson). McCoy's appearance on \"\" on the November 13, 2007, episode \"Blinded\", marked his first appearance in the \"Law & Order\" universe as district attorney. The replacement for his former position is Michael Cutter (Linus Roache), a prosecutor with a penchant for recklessness not unlike McCoy's own in his younger days. This occasionally presents political difficulties for the new district attorney. More than once, McCoy berates Cutter for reckless conduct, in the same manner as he was berated by district attorneys when he was executive assistant district attorney.\n\nIn the season 19 episode \"Lucky Stiff\", McCoy begins his election campaign for New York County District Attorney after serving the last season and a half as interim DA. In the season-19 episode \"Promote This\", in 1991 his wife Ellen (whom he was divorcing) is revealed to have unknowingly employed an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. This causes McCoy political havoc during a murder case where the motive was racism against illegal immigrants of Hispanic descent. In the episode \"Skate or Die\", the place where his final campaign fundraiser would be held is discovered by the organizers to be owned by a man who served a 20-year prison sentence for racketeering. Eventually, the final campaign fundraiser is held at a Chinese seafood restaurant with a kosher section.\n\nMcCoy is hand-picked for the interim DA position by Governor Donald Shalvoy (Tom Everett Scott), and the two initially have a friendly, productive working relationship. By the end of the 18th season, however, McCoy discovers that Shalvoy is involved in a prostitution scandal that is tied to a murder case he is prosecuting. Angered and disappointed, McCoy orders Cutter to start investigating Shalvoy, who retaliates by lending his support to McCoy's opponent in the election. In the last episode of season 19, \"The Drowned and the Saved\", Cutter uncovers evidence that Shalvoy tried to buy a Senate seat for his wife Rita (Alison Elliot), who ordered the murder, and threatens him with public disgrace unless he resigns. McCoy's opponent suddenly has no patron, giving McCoy good prospects for victory. In the opening episode of season 20, McCoy is revealed to have won the election; he serves as DA for the remainder of this final season of \"Law & Order\".\n\nWhile he is a brilliant legal mind, McCoy has more than a few personal demons. He was abused by his father, an Irish Chicago policeman who had also beat Jack's mother, and who eventually died of cancer. McCoy says that his determination and unyielding work ethic are a byproduct of having been harshly punished by his father for losing at anything. He also revealed that his father was a racist who once hit him for dating a Polish girl. McCoy disliked his father, calling him a \"son-of-a-bitch\"; however, he admits he could have easily become like him.\n\nWhile not a nationalist, he cares enough about his heritage to be offended by a lawyer's insinuation that two murder suspects committed the crime because of their \"Irish temper\".\n\nMcCoy has been divorced twice (one ex-wife having been a former assistant) and has an adult daughter, Rebecca, with first ex-wife Ellen. One of his ex-wives left him because he worked too many late nights. A gossip columnist writes that McCoy has not seen or spoken to his daughter since 1997, and McCoy receives an envelope containing pictures of his daughter. He does not open the envelope; rather, he places it in his bottom left desk drawer, next to a bottle of Jim Beam. In \"Fallout\", the last scene shows McCoy meeting his daughter (Jamie Schofield) at a restaurant. During a conversation with (fictional) New York Governor Donald Shalvoy, he mentions Rebecca has taken a job in San Diego, and that she drove up to Los Angeles to meet him there for dinner while he was attending a conference on official business; the governor uses this to try to smear McCoy, wrongly implying that he used public funds to visit Rebecca. In the season-20 episode \"Dignity\", McCoy mentions to EADA Michael Cutter (Linus Roache) and ADA Connie Rubirosa (Alana de la Garza) that his daughter is either pregnant or a new mother, thus making him soon to be or already a grandfather. He also has a nephew, which indicates that he has at least one sibling. By 2008, his nephew had a young daughter.\n\nMcCoy has a reputation for having romantic affairs with his ADAs. Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy) mentions this when they first meet; he tells her he has had affairs with only three of his ADAs, but by the end of the episode, she realizes that he has only had three female ADAs before her. In the episode \"Scoundrels\", McCoy reveals that defense attorney Sally Bell (Edie Falco) had been one of those ADAs. He at one point was revealed to have had a romantic relationship with his frequent courtroom adversary, defense attorney Vanessa Galiano (Roma Maffia). Kincaid initially makes it clear that she is not interested in a romantic relationship, and McCoy agrees to her stipulation. However, throughout the two seasons in which the two characters appear together, they are implied to be having an affair, with the relationship eventually confirmed in the season-9 episode \"Sideshow\", long after the Kincaid character had exited the show. Kincaid is killed in a car accident, a source of ongoing pain for McCoy; her death is implied to be the motivation for his legally questionable prosecution of an alcoholic who has killed several people while driving under the influence. Defense attorneys have used his sexual history against him. Since Kincaid's death, McCoy has kept his relationships with assistants professional, albeit friendly.\n\nMcCoy's affairs with his ADAs have often had explosive consequences. For instance, his former ADA Diana Hawthorne (Laila Robins), with whom he had a sexual relationship, was found to have suppressed evidence so they could win a case, resulting in an innocent man going to prison. During her trial for intentionally engineering the wrongful convictions, Hawthorne claims that the convictions earned McCoy a promotion he was seeking. Ironically, in the same trial, during which McCoy is forced to admit he was having an affair with Hawthorne, he is being represented by Kincaid, with whom he is presently having an affair.\n\nIn \"House Counsel\", McCoy tries to prosecute a mobster for bribing and murdering a juror. The man's lawyer, Paul Kopell (Ron Leibman), is one of McCoy's oldest friends, with whom he had a competitive relationship for years, and he proves to be equally aggressive in his approach to his work. As Kopell repeatedly stymies McCoy's prosecutorial efforts, McCoy takes the position that Kopell is not acting as an independent attorney, but as a participant in organized crime, and eventually prosecutes Kopell for conspiracy in the juror's murder. He tells Kopell's wife Anna (Jessica Walter) that the prosecution is not personal, but she angrily replies that McCoy simply wants the final victory over a rival. By the end of the episode, though he has won the case, McCoy is so troubled that he does not even want to share an elevator with Kincaid.\n\nWhile McCoy was not exactly a part of the 1960s counterculture, he did protest against the policies of the Richard Nixon administration, particularly the Vietnam War. In 1972, he published an article in the \"New York University Law Review\" in defense of Catholic priests who had been opposed to the conflict. He does retain some of the wild streak from his youth; he is a fan of The Clash and he rides a Yamaha motorcycle. He is opposed to the Iraq War.\n\nUnlike his predecessor Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty), McCoy embraces the option of the death penalty, claiming it is a suitable punishment for particularly heinous crimes and a useful threat in plea bargaining. This often leads to heated arguments with his more liberal colleagues. In \"Savages\", when the death penalty has just been restored in New York following the election of Governor George Pataki, Kincaid asks McCoy about the probability of executing an innocent individual. McCoy responds that, with the lengthy prosecution process and opportunities for the defendant to appeal the verdict, the probability of wrongful execution is unlikely. Kincaid asks McCoy if he is able to accept the probability of \"unlikely\"; his hesitation indicates that he has never considered the possibility. In later seasons, his view towards the death penalty has apparently changed: in season 18's \"Executioner\", he is deeply troubled hearing of a gruesomely botched execution in South Carolina, and in season 20's \"Four Cops Shot\", he resists efforts by a U.S. attorney to prosecute a suspect in the murder of a police officer under a federal death penalty statute.\n\nHe has shown mercy on occasion, such as the 1997 episode \"Burned\" in which he prosecutes Terence Lawlor (Sam Huntington), a teenage boy with bipolar disorder, for murdering his sister. The boy's grandfather Carl Anderton (Robert Vaughn), a wealthy CEO (and good friend of Schiff's) who also proved to suffer from the disorder, had attempted to get his grandson to plead guilty and go to jail rather than plead insanity and be committed to a mental institution, fearing that a public revelation of the boy's illness would provide enough evidence to reveal his own illness and affect his reputation. McCoy leads the effort to prevent an unjust punishment for the boy. Similarly, in season seven's \"Deadbeat\", he declines to prosecute a woman who is the sole caregiver for a boy dying of cancer, although he implies that he may do so once the boy has died.\n\nMcCoy was raised Catholic, but does not appear to be in practice, and has not been for some time; he describes himself as a \"lapsed Catholic\". McCoy was educated by the Jesuits. On several occasions, religion has been the subject of various cases. In the episode \"Thrill\", in which two teenaged boys are accused of killing a man for fun, McCoy finds his case particularly complicated when one of the suspects confesses the crime to his uncle, a priest. When the confession tape is labeled privileged, McCoy ignores the bishop's request to preserve the sacrament of reconciliation and instead tries to use the tape as evidence. When Detective Rey Curtis (Benjamin Bratt) tries to dissuade McCoy from doing so, reminding him that he is a Catholic, McCoy responds, \"Not when I'm at work.\"\n\nWhen a man is accused of killing a drug dealer who killed the man's son, a priest (Denis O'Hare) confesses to the crime. Though McCoy personally believes that the priest is covering for the man, he prosecutes the priest, instead. At the end of the episode, McCoy says that he lost his faith after the death of a childhood friend.\n\nMcCoy's unconventional and sometimes ruthless professional conduct has put his job in jeopardy more than once throughout the series. Some of the more serious occurrences are:\n\nMcCoy has appeared in four episodes of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"; however, he is often referred to in the series, and his actions affect the ADAs working with the Special Victims Unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" television critic Ken Tucker has praised \"Law & Order\"s creator Dick Wolf for putting McCoy at the center of \"some of the best episodes of the immortal series' 19th season.\" Tucker elaborates how the character, riding \"herd over a couple of stubborn young bucks — assistant DAs Mike Cutter (Linus Roache) and Connie Rubirosa (Alana de la Garza) — McCoy argues, bellows orders, and croaks with outrage when his charges disobey his legal advice.\"\n\n"}

He has written various books of children's comedy poetry including; \"The Spot on my Bum\", \"The Return of the Spot\", \"Someone's Nicked My Knickers\",Parents, Zits and Hairy Bits, Norah's Nasty Kickers, Fido's Foul Surprise, Don't Wee in the Bath, Terry and Mum, the Dog's Drunk Again! In addition, he is also the author of a trilogy of sword-and-sorcery fantasy novels: \"The Man in the Skirt\", \"Banshee Moon\" and \"The Keeper\".\n\nIn 1997 he began touring promoting his wacky and zany poetry. This has included many performances at schools, libraries and festivals in the UK and beyond, in Germany, Luxembourg and other venues. In addition, his best-selling book, The Spot on My Bum, was translated into Portuguese in 2012 under the title A Borbulha No Rabo, by Portuguese poet Helder Moulder Pereira.\n\nIn April 2018 he co-founded the charity Platform 1 in huddersfield .\n\nGez Walsh burst onto the poetry scene in 1997 armed with his first collection of children's verse, The Spot on My Bum: Horrible Poems for Horrible Children, which was rapidly to become a cult classic. Written in response to his dyslexic son's need for stimulating, approachable reading material, Gez decided to use humour as his tool to encourage interest. Quickly realising he'd hit on a successful method of providing reluctant readers with enthusiasm, Gez's world of laughter sprang into life. Soon it was not only his son enjoying hilarious performances of these poems, but a much wider audience of enthusiasts at schools, festivals, book signings and charity events.\n\nAdding to his range of material for an ever-growing army of fans Gez penned The Return of The Spot: More Horrible Poems for More Horrible Children (1997). Encouraged by this success Gez decided to try and further his appeal by branching out into fiction. In 1998 volume one of the Celtic Chronicles trilogy, The Man in The Skirt, was published and promptly reviewed on popular children's television programme Fully Booked. A year later in 1999 his followers were presented with his next poetry offering, Someone's Nicked My Knickers: Poems to Make Your Toes Curl, then, in 2000, Parents, Zits and Hairy Bits: The World According to Wilf, a big hit with teenagers.\n\nTowards the end of 2001 Fido's Foul Surprise And Other 'Ruff' Rhymes hit the bookshops, closely followed by the second volume of the comedy-horror Celtic Chronicles, Banshee Moon.\n\n2002 saw Gez's sixth potty poetry collection, Norah's Nasty Knickers: Crazy Poems for Cool Kids come into being, receiving a warm reception from fans and generating media interest, while 2003 provided the much-awaited concluding volume to the Celtic Chronicles trilogy in the shape of The Keeper.\n\nAlongside Gez's Potty Poets titles, the first book in the author's new educational series, Fax 4 U, was released, entitled Drugs - Booze, Glue, Cigs and Coffee, too!, part of a set of books aimed at broaching issues facing 21st century young people. The end of the year also heralded the entry of Don't Wee in the Bath, Terry!: Potty Poems with a Capital \"P\", the author's eleventh book.\n\n2004 proved a busy time for Gez. Writing and performing full-time took his unique brand of humour to schools, libraries and festivals around the country with his reputation as a motivator of reluctant readers growing alongside his popularity. Bringing Gez's published work to the dozen mark was the author's most recent poetry collection, Mum, the Dog's Drunk Again! Horribly Potty Poems for Horribly Horrid Kids. This brought Gez to the attention of the nation once more as BBC's Look North televised his comic poetry performance during a World Book Day celebration in a Yorkshire school, while Radio Five Live also featured Gez's antics.\n\nSince the publication of \"Mum, The Dog's Drunk Again\", Gez Walsh has concentrated his writing in other directions. While he continued keeping faith with the Potty Poets brand by working on \"Great Aunt Fanny's Moustache\" which is still forthcoming, Walsh has really been concentrating on his new series of fiction for young adults, Twisted Minds. Volume 1 of this series, The Meeting Room, was originally published initially as a digital book for download only; however, it is due for release in book form in late 2014. In the meantime, two other volumes, Changes and Diva Dave and Fat Sue, have appeared both in book form and as e-books.\n\nWalsh has also developed a stand-up act for adult audiences, and regularly presents the Wednesday afternoon show on Phoenix FM Radio in Calderdale, West Yorkshire. In the summer of 2014 he was appointed as the official \"poet laureate\" of Calderdale.

It allowed users of the Microsoft Windows operating system to change the appearance of their mouse cursor and to allow websites to use customized cursors for visitors. The product installed itself without user permission and is an early example of spyware.\n\nComet Systems was founded in 1997. Its most famous product, Comet Cursor, was released the same year for free. When installed, Comet Cursor changes a user's mouse cursor when they visit participating websites. Websites could use these cursors to display their own brands instead of standard icons. By 1999, there were 55,000 websites using the technology, including Comedy Central, Mattel, and Warner Bros. Banner ads also used the technology. Comet reported 20 million users in 2001, when it integrated a price comparison service in the software.\n\nThe company was criticized for secretly tracking users who installed the software, each of whom was given a unique serial number. In November 1999, the company started distributing its software as part of a package with several versions of RealNetworks' RealPlayer multimedia software. That same month, the RealPlayer was accused of violating the privacy of its users and breaching its own privacy policy by collecting information about what software was installed alongside the RealPlayer. Compounding the issue of spyware, the software installed itself unknowingly on many users' computers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser allowed ActiveX controls, such as Comet Cursor, to install themselves with no user interaction and without asking permission, and users did not realize they had installed Comet Cursor with RealPlayer.\n\nFor these reasons, Comet Cursor was cited as one of the 25 Worst Tech Products by \"PC World\". Although no longer distributed, the product has been blacklisted as spyware by some internet watchdog companies such as Lavasoft and Symantec. Microsoft recommends that users who experience problems with the application uninstall it. FindWhat.com purchased Comet in February 2004, and the Comet Cursor was phased out of their product line.\n"}

() is a Latin phrase literally meaning 'and you, Brutus?' or 'also you, Brutus?', often translated as 'You as well, Brutus?' or 'Even you, Brutus?'. The quote appears in William Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\", where it is spoken by the Roman dictator Julius Caesar, at the moment of his assassination, to his supposed friend Marcus Brutus, upon recognizing him as one of the assassins. The first known occurrences of the phrase are said to be in two earlier Elizabethan plays; \"Henry VI, Part 3\" by Shakespeare, and an even earlier play, \"Caesar Interfectus\", by Richard Edes. The phrase is often used apart from the plays to signify an unexpected betrayal by a friend. \n\nThere is no evidence that the historical Caesar spoke these words. Though the historical Caesar's last words are not known with certainty, the Roman historian Suetonius, a century and a half after the incident, claims Caesar said nothing as he died, but that others reported that Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase , which means 'You too, child?' or 'You too, young man?' to Brutus. Another commonly quoted variation of this Greek sentence in Latin is \"Tu quoque, Brute?\" Contrary to popular belief, the words are not Caesar's last in the play, as he says \"Then fall Caesar!\" right after.\n\nThe name \"Brutus\", a second declension masculine noun, appears in the phrase in the vocative case, and so the \"‑us\" ending of the nominative case is replaced by \"‑e\".\n\nOn March 15 (the Ides of March), 44 BC, the historic Caesar was attacked by a group of senators, including Brutus, who was Caesar's friend and protégé. Caesar initially resisted his attackers, but when he saw Brutus, he reportedly responded as he died. Suetonius mentions the quote merely as a rumor, as does Plutarch who also reports that Caesar said nothing, but merely pulled his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.\nCaesar saying \"Et tu, Brute?\" in Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\" (1599) was not the first time the phrase was used in a dramatic play. Edmond Malone claimed that it appeared in a work that has since been lost—Richard Eedes's Latin play \"Caesar Interfectus\" of 1582. The phrase had also occurred in another play by Shakespeare, \"The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixth, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke\" of 1595, which is the earliest printed version of \"Henry VI, Part 3\".\n\nIt has been argued that the phrase can be interpreted as a curse or warning. One theory states that the historic Caesar adapted the words of a Greek sentence which to the Romans had long since become proverbial: The complete phrase is said to have been \"You too, my son, will have a taste of power,\" of which Caesar only needed to invoke the opening words to foreshadow Brutus' own violent death, in response to his assassination. The poem \"Satires; Book I, Satire 7\" by Horace, written approximately 30 BC, mentions Brutus and his tyrannicide; in discussing that poem, author John Henderson considers that the expression \"E-t t-u Br-u-t-e\", (as he hyphenates it), can be interpreted as a complaint containing a \"suggestion of mimetic compulsion\".\n\n\n"}

It was first published in 1904 by the journal \"Irish Homestead\" and later featured in his 1914 collection of short stories \"Dubliners\".\n\nA young woman, Eveline, of about nineteen years of age sits by her window, waiting to leave home. She muses on the aspects of her life that are driving her away, while \"in her nostrils was the odor of dusty cretonne\". Her mother has died as has her older brother Ernest. Her remaining brother, Harry, is on the road \"in the church decorating business\". She fears that her father will beat her as he used to beat her brothers and she has little loyalty for her sales job. She has fallen for a sailor named Frank who promises to take her with him to Buenos Aires. Before leaving to meet Frank, she hears an organ grinder outside, which reminds her of a melody that played on an organ on the day her mother died and the promise she made to her mother to look after the home. At the dock where she and Frank are ready to embark on a ship together, Eveline is deeply conflicted and makes the painful decision not to leave with him. Nonetheless, her face registers no emotion at all. \n\nLike other tales in \"Dubliners\", such as \"Araby\", \"Eveline\" features a circular journey, where a character decides to go back to where their journey began and where the result of their journey is disappointment and reluctance to travel.\n\n"}

Originally registered on 31 May in Quebec, she sailed to Great Britain and assumed British registry. She made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC), in 1827-1828. In 1829 she transported the first civilian officials and settlers of the Swan River Colony to Western Australia. She then made two voyages transporting convicts to New South Wales, Australia. A fire damaged her irreparably in May 1839.\n\n\"Parmelia\" \"was more of a plain working girl than the great and beautiful lady of the sea\". \"Parmelia\" sailed to London and on 17 November she was transferred from the Quebec to the London register. In 1826 she was used as a troop carrier.\n\nSome time in the first half of 1827, \"Parmelia\" was sold to Joseph Somes, who was also a director of the EIC. For the next year, she operated under charter to the British East India Company, carrying goods and passengers between London and Bengal.\n\nCaptain John Wimble sailed from the Downs on 19 June 1827, bound for Bengal and Madras. \"Parmelia\" arrived at Calcutta on 3 December. Homeward bound, she was at Fultahm, on the Hooghly River, on 18 January 1828. She was at Vizagapatam on 30 January, and Madras on 9 February. She reached Saint Helena on 30 April and arrived at the Downs on 3 July.\n\nIn 1828 the British government, at the urging of Captain James Stirling, decided to establish a colony at the Swan River in Western Australia. was despatched under Charles Fremantle to annex the colony, and it was arranged that a contingent of soldiers, officials and settlers would follow on . Stirling, whom the government had appointed the civil superintendent of the colony, however argued that the passengers and goods to be carried exceeded the capacity of \"Sulphur\", and asked that an additional ship to be chartered. The government reluctantly agreed to the extra cost, chartering \"Parmelia\" in December 1828. It was then arranged that \"Sulphur\" would carry a detachment of the 63rd Regiment, with \"Parmelia\" carrying the civilian officials and settlers.\n\n\"Sulphur\" and \"Parmelia\" sailed from Spithead off Portsmouth, England on 3 or 6 February 1829, sighting their destination on 1 June. Contrary to popular belief, Stirling did not captain \"Parmelia\" (J. H. Luscombe did); on arrival, however, he assumed the duties of pilot. He initially tried to enter Cockburn Sound through a passage that he had discovered in 1827, but was prevented by strong winds and a heavy swell. Instead he chose to remain off Rottnest Island for the night. The following day, he tried to bring \"Parmelia\" into the Sound from the north, against the advice of Fremantle, and ran aground on a sand bank, later to be named Parmelia Bank. Despite the best efforts of the crews to dislodge her, \"Parmelia\" remained on the bank for over 18 hours, finally coming off the bank by herself early the following morning. By that time, she had lost her foreyard, rudder, windlass, spare spars, longboat and skiff, and was leaking at a rate of per hour. \"Parmelia\" then rode out a storm at anchor for three days before finally being brought to a safe anchorage. The passengers were able to disembark on 8 June.\n\n\"Challenger\" was due to depart once \"Sulphur\" and \"Parmelia\" had arrived, but \"Parmelia\" needed repairs that it could not get without access to the skilled labour amongst \"Challenger\" crew. Fremantle therefore took the decision to remain and assist with the repairs, which were completed many weeks later. Later that year, Stirling chartered \"Parmelia\" to bring food supplies from Java. In 1830, she returned to England via Singapore. She carried to Singapore members of the crew of , which had wrecked on 4 March.\n\nCaptain James Gilbert sailed from Sheerness on 28 July 1832. \"Parmelia\" arrived at Sydney on 16 November. She had embarked 200 male convicts and she landed 196, four having died en route. \"Parmelia\" sailed from Sydney late in December 1832 and arrived in Batavia on 29 January 1833. She left Batavia on 5 March, reached Saint Helena on 17 May, and arrived back at Portsmouth on 8 August.\n\nCaptain James Gilbert sailed from Cork on 27 October 1833. \"Parmelia\" arrived at Sydney on 2 March 1834. She embarked 220 male convicts and she landed 218, two convicts having died en route. On 12 April \"Parmelia\" sailed for Manila.\n\n\"Parmelia\" then continued to sail as a London-based transport. She was last listed in 1838 with J. Spence, master, J. Somes, owner, and trade London-transport.\nIn 1839 \"Parmelia\" was refitted to carry migrants to the Americas. She was intended to run between Britain and Quebec, but on 1 May 1839, as her refit was almost complete, a fire in Bank's Yard, at Frank's Queery, Cremyll, destroyed her. Eight days later she was surveyed and declared a constructive total loss. She was then sold for breaking up.\n\nThe Kwinana suburb of Parmelia is named in honour of \"Parmelia\", as is Parmelia Bank.\n\nThe following people embarked \"Parmelia\" when she left Portsmouth in February 1829.\n\n"}

It is similar to the common goldfish, except slightly smaller and slimmer, and is mainly distinguished by its long deeply forked tail. \nComet goldfish tend to have a diverse variety of colors, unlike the common house pet goldfish. \n\nThe comet-tailed goldfish breed was developed in the United States from the common goldfish by Hugo Mulertt, a government worker, in the 1880s. The comet goldfish was first seen in the ponds of the U.S. Government Fish Commission in Washington, D.C.. Mulertt later became a propagator of goldfish and an author of books on goldfish. He introduced the comet onto the fish-keeping market in quantity.\n\nThe comet goldfish can be distinguished from the common goldfish by its long, single and deeply forked tail fin. Comets with yellow, orange, red, white, and red-and-white coloration are common. The red coloration mainly appears on the tailfin and dorsal fin, but can also appear on the pelvic fin.\n\nThe comet is more active than most other goldfish breeds. It is not unusual to see a comet dashing back and forth in its tank, racing around in a playful manner. Due to the comet's hardy and active nature, and the relative ease in caring for them, they are the breed best suited to ponds and outdoor pools. They are often kept with koi in outdoor ponds. Comets have a natural life span of 5 to 14 years and may live even longer in optimal conditions.\n\n\nGoldfish are commonly bred on fish farms in many parts of the world. In most instances, the fish produced are offered for sale to aquarists. However, in North America, there is a demand for goldfish used as bait or \"feeder fish\" to other fish by anglers. Due to the relatively inexpensive prices of comet goldfish, they may also be used as prizes in carnivals or other places of entertainment.\n\n"}

The province has 128 km of coastline, 22,000 ha of lagoons and over 200,000 ha of forest. There is an extensive complex of imperial tombs and temples in Huế.\n\nThe region's history dates back some 2,800 years according to archaeological findings from the Sa Huynh Culture as well as from relics in the region. Đại Việt became an independent nation around 938 BC of which territorial conflict lasts for about four centuries between the Đại Việt and the Champa. The two provinces then changed their names to Thanh and Hóa. In 1307, Đoàn Nhữ Hài was appointed by the emperor, Trần Anh Tông, to administer the area. The people from the north (Thanh Hóa) migrated south and integrated with the people of the Kingdom of Champa. During this time, had the settlement of Hoa Chau Province began, which included the area of present-day Thừa Thiên.\n\nBetween the settlement of Thuận Hóa (1306) to the founding of Phú Xuân (1687), there were conflicts and uncertainties for the local people, which including the fall of the Trần Dynasty to the renaissance of the Hồ dynasty. Thuận Hóa and Phú Xuân became the location of the Đại Việt kingdom once Nguyễn Hoàng was appointed head of Thuận Hóa (1511–1558). Lord Nguyễn Hoàng (1558–1613) established bases at Ai Tu, Tra Bat and Dinh Cat, while his lords moved palaces to (1636), where they would eventually base their operations in Phú Xuân (1687). The Nguyễn lords ruled the area until it taken over the Trinh clan in 1775. The farmers movement led by the Tây Sơn brothers gained momentum in 1771. The Tây Sơn insurgent army won the battle in Phú Xuân to take over the Nguyễn capital in 1786, where they continued north and overthrew the Trinh Dynasty. In Phú Xuân, Nguyễn Huệ appointed himself king, and with internal differences with the Tây Sơn Movement and the death of Nguyễn Huệ (1792), Nguyễn Ánh took advantage of the situation and took over Gia Định with the support of foreign forces. Nguyễn Ánh attached to the Tây Sơn movement and took over Phú Xuân and the throne, thereby choosing the dynasty title of Gia Long (1802). Phú Xuân was again chosen as the capital of Vietnam until 1945's August Revolution. Prior to 1975, the province was known simply as Thừa Thiên.\n\nThe province is known as an area of heavy fighting during the Vietnam War, as it was the second-most northerly province of the South Vietnam, close to the North Vietnamese border (DMZ) at the 17th parallel. More U.S. soldiers died in this province than in any other province in Vietnam (2,893). The Massacre at Huế occurred here; an estimated 2,800 to 6,000 civilians and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) prisoners of war (POWs) were slaughtered by the Việt Cộng. Thừa Thiên-Huế province saw a large influx of North Vietnamese settlers soon after the Vietnam War ended, as with the rest of the former South. This province and neighbouring Quảng Nam Province suffered greatly from flooding in November 1999. \n\nThừa Thiên-Huế Province borders Quảng Trị Province to the north, the city of Đà Nẵng to the east, Quảng Nam Province to the south, and the Savannakhet, Salavan and Sekong provinces of Laos to the west.

It covers and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone. The climate is similar to central Vietnam in general: a tropical monsoon climate. In the plains and in the hills, the average annual temperature is , but in the mountains only (statistical yearbook 2004). The cool season is from November to March with cold northeasterly winds. The lowest average monthly temperature is in January: . In the cool season temperatures can fall to in the plains and the relative humidity is high, between 85 and 95 per cent. Then follows a warmer period from April to September with average monthly temperatures up to in July, reaching up to at times. It is very humid in July but relative humidity is lower, sometimes down to 50 per cent.\n\nThe annual precipitation in the province is but there are important variations. Depending on the year the annual average may be to in the plains and to in the mountains. In some years the rainfall may be much higher and reach more than in the mountains. The rainy season is from September to December—about 70 per cent of the precipitation occurring in those months. Rainfall often occurs in short heavy bursts which can cause flooding and erosion, with serious social, economic and environmental consequences. The floods of November 1999 led to 600 deaths and affected 600,000 homes. (Comité des inondations, 1999).\n\nA remote region known as the \"Green Corridor\" is home to many species. New species of snake, butterfly, and orchid have been found there in 2005 and 2006, as stated by Chris Dickinson of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on 26 September 2007. The scientists discovered 11 new species of plants and animals, including a snake, two butterflies and five leafless orchid varieties. The new snake species is a white-lipped keelback (\"Hebius leucomystax\"). The new butterfly species are the \"\"skipper\"\" from the genus \" Zela\" and the other from Satyrinae. The new plant species also include one in the Aspidistra family, and a poisonous \"Arum\" perennial.\n\nThừa Thiên-Huế is subdivided into 9 district-level sub-divisions:\n\n\n\n\nThey are further subdivided into 8 commune-level towns (or townlets), 105 communes, and 39 wards.\n\nThe average population of the province is 1.143.572, which consist of approximately 567.253 males and 576.319 females. The rural population is approximately 587.516 while the urban population is 556.056 (2015).\nThe retail sales of goods and services (trade, hotel, restaurant, tourism) in the province is 10960.6 billion đồng or 0.9 percent of the country. This is compared with 12.7 percent for Hanoi and 23.5 percent for Ho Chi Minh City (2009). The province has more than 120 km of coastline, which provides for a seafood industry that produces over 40,000 tonnes/year consisting of over 500 species of fish.\n\nThere are more than 100 mines for minerals and non-mineral resources with the majority consisting of limestone, granite and kaolin. Arts (e.g. wood works, fabrics, furnitures, paper arts, pottery), literature (text books), and spicy cuisines (included dry goods, vegetarian food) are the main exports of this region. Exquisite custom-made áo dài (Vietnamese long dress), and nón lá (conical hat) are souvenir items for foreign visitors and overseas Vietnamese. The ability to make toys, design lanterns, form special papers, and figurine-making are native skills. Such fruits as rambutan, jackfruit, lychee, durian, dao, dragon fruit, star fruit, mangosteen, coconut, and kumquat are grown in this area due to sufficient amount of rain received each year.\n\nMany historical buildings are located in Huế, largely a legacy from its time as a capital of the Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945), including the Royal Citadel, the Flag Tower, the Royal Palace, and the Royal Tombs. Huế's Forbidden Purple City was once reserved for the royal family, but was severely damaged during the Vietnam War. Outside the city is the religious site known as Nam Giao Hill (\"Heaven's Altar\"). Hue Brewery Ltd is located on Hương Giang in Huế with a recognizable brand in central Vietnam. The Brewery is jointed owned by the state and private sector and was founded in 1990 with an initial investment of 2.4 million USD with a capacity of 3 million liters/year, which has grown to a capacity of 100 million liters/year in 2007.\n\nVietnam's National Route 1A, which runs the entire length of the nation from north to south, passes through Huế. Huế and Đà Nẵng are the main intermediate stops on the railway line from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. This province is served by two sea ports: Thuan An Port and Chân Mây Port. Phu Bai International Airport, the largest domestic airport in terms of passengers per year is situated 15 km south of Huế. This airport ranks fourth among Vietnam's airports. The government has approved the upgrade of this airport to an international airport with some air links inside Asia. \n\nThis city is home to Huế University (e.g.: Huế Economic University, Huế Medicine University, Huế Pedagogical University, Huế Forestry and Agriculture University, Huế University of Sciences, Huế University of Arts, Huế Conservatory of Music and Huế College of Foreign Languages). As of 2009 the province had 190 schools, 1302 classrooms, 2184 teachers and 36,200 pupils.\n\nThe most famous high school in Thua Thien Hue province is Quốc Học – Huế High School for the Gifted. It is well-known for its high quality of education. Besides, its reputation comes from its ancient structure of France.\n\n\nThe province's name derives from Sino-Vietnamese 承天順化.\n"}

It used a cordite cartridge to move a piston, which cranked the engine. The Coffman system was one of the most common brands; another was the Breeze cartridge system, which was produced under Coffman patents. Most American military aircraft and tanks which used radial engines were equipped with this system. Some versions of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine used in the British Supermarine Spitfire used the Coffman system as a starter. The Hawker Typhoon also used the Coffman system to start its Napier Sabre engine.\n\nCartridge starters used on a number of jet engines, including such engines as the Rolls-Royce Avon, which were used in the English Electric Canberra and Hawker Hunter, used a high gas volume cartridge driving a turbine instead of a piston.\n\nSome Snowcat and similar vehicles used in extreme low temperatures were historically equipped with cartridge start.\n\nThe Coffman device used a large blank cartridge containing Cordite that, when fired, pushed a piston forward. A screw thread driven by the piston engaged with the engine, turning it over. This was in contrast with other type of cartridge starter which acted directly to drive the engine piston down and so turn the rest of the engine over, such as those used on the Field-Marshall agricultural diesel tractor.\n\nThe other systems used during the period were electric motors (such as those used in automobiles today), inertia starters (cranked either by hand or an electric motor) and compressed-air starters, which operated much like Coffman starters but were powered by pressurized air tanks.\n\nShotgun starters are composed of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which is connected to the motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun barrel. The blank cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and engage the starter ring gear on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft.\n\nShotgun starters had several advantages over other starting systems in use at the time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the starter ring gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, and it did not require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.\n\nThe primary disadvantages of the shotgun starter are the need to keep a stock of cartridges, one of which is used for each attempt to start, and the short time that the motor is spun by each cartridge. Compressed-air starters, which use the same type of motor, are usually recharged by an engine-driven compressor, negating the need to carry cartridges, but adding requirements for the compressor and air tank. Hybrid systems can be made simply by adding a cartridge breech or an air tank to an existing system. Air tanks can also be recharged from an external source in an emergency, such as a hand pump or a portable air compressor.\n\nThe Coffman starter was the most common brand of cartridge starters during the mid-1930s, and the name was used as a generic description. Advances in electrical technology have made shotgun starters obsolete for most uses.\n\n\n"}

He served during the reign of Maria Theresa and was a close friend to Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, becoming one of the latter's advisers. Lacy was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHis father, Count Peter von Lacy, was a Russian Field Marshal who belonged to the Irish branch of the de Lacy family and had followed James II into exile. His mother, Countess Margareta Philippina von Lacy, nee von Funcken, was a Baltic German. Franz Moritz was born in St Petersburg, and was educated in Germany for a military career, and entered the Austrian service. He served in Italy, Bohemia, Silesia and the Netherlands during the War of the Austrian Succession, was twice wounded, and by the end of the war was a lieutenant-colonel. At the age of twenty-five he became full colonel and chief of an infantry regiment.\n\nIn 1756 with the opening of the Seven Years' War he was again on active service, and in the first battle (Lobositz) he distinguished himself so much that he was at once promoted major-general. He received his third wound on this occasion and his fourth at the battle of Prague in 1757. Later in 1757 Lacy bore a conspicuous part in the great victory of Breslau, and at Leuthen, where he received his fifth wound, he covered the retreat of the defeated army. Soon after this began his association with Field-Marshal Daun, the new generalissimo of the empress's forces, and these two commanders, powerfully assisted later by the genius of Laudon, made headway against Frederick the Great for the remainder of the war.\n\nLacy, a lieutenant field-marshal at thirty-two, was made chief of staff (quartermaster-general) to Daun in the newly created general staff. They were cautious to the point of timidity since Leuthen and many other bitter defeats had taught the Austrians to respect Frederick; but, having resolved to wear out the enemy by Fabian methods, they were strong enough to persist to the end. Thus for some years the life of Lacy, as of Daun and Laudon, is the story of the war against Prussia. After Hochkirch (October 15, 1758) Lacy received the Grand Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa. In 1759 both Daun and Lacy fell into disfavour for failing to win victories, and Lacy owed his promotion to Feldzeugmeister only to the fact that Laudon had just received this rank for the brilliant conduct of his detachment at Kunersdorf. He shadowed Frederick the Great's Prussian army during the failed Siege of Dresden in 1760. His responsibilities told heavily on Lacy in the ensuing campaigns, and his capacity for supreme command was doubted even by Daun, who refused to give him the command when he himself was wounded at Torgau.\n\nAfter the Treaty of rg a new sphere of activity was opened, in which Lacy's special gifts had the greatest scope. Maria Theresa having placed her son, Emperor Joseph II, at the head of Austrian military affairs, Lacy was made a field marshal, and given the task of reforming and administering the army (1766). He framed new regulations for each arm, a new code of military law, a good supply system. As the result of his work the Austrian army was more numerous, far better equipped, and cheaper than it had ever been before. Joseph soon became very intimate with his military adviser, but this did not prevent his mother, after she became estranged from the young emperor, from giving Lacy her full confidence. His activities were not confined to the army. He was in sympathy with Joseph's innovations, and was regarded by Maria Theresa as a prime mover in the scheme for the partition of Poland. But his self-imposed work broke down Lacy's health, and in 1773, in spite of the remonstrances of Maria Theresa and of the emperor, he laid down all his offices and went to southern France. On returning he was still unable to resume office, though as an unofficial adviser in political and military matters he was far from idle.\nIn the brief and uneventful War of the Bavarian Succession, Lacy and Laudon were the chief Austrian commanders against the King of Prussia, and when Joseph II at Maria Theresa's death, became the sovereign of the Austrian dominions as well as emperor, Lacy remained his most trusted friend. More serious than the War of the Bavarian Succession was the Turkish war which presently broke out. Lacy was now old and worn out, and his tenure of command therein was not marked by any greater measure of success than in the case of the other Austrian generals. His active career was at an end, although he continued his effective interest in the affairs of the state and the army throughout the reign of Joseph's successor, Leopold II. His last years were spent in retirement at his castle of Neuwaldegg near Vienna. He is buried in a mausoleum in the castle grounds.\n\nHis father was Peter Lacy.\n\n\n"}

As Chief Justice, he presided over both the High Court and the Supreme Court, but was constitutionally barred from presiding over, or even sitting on, the Appeal Court. On 3 January 2007, he was sent on leave by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, which had seized power on 5 December 2006. On 19 January, he was formally suspended, pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. This investigation was dropped in December 2008 as part of a deal that involved his formal resignation.\n\nFatiaki was born in Upu village in the district of Motusa, on the island of Rotuma, which enjoys a considerable degree of internal autonomy from Fiji. He moved with his family to Suva, the Fijian capital, for schooling. After attending Marist Brothers Primary School, he went on to study at Marist Brothers High School from 1967 to 1970. He enrolled in the Foundation Programme at the University of the South Pacific for one year, and won the Morris Hedstrom scholarship to study Law at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, from which he graduated in 1976.\n\nFatiaki practiced Law in New Zealand from 1977 to 1979, and in Fiji from 1979 to 1984. He was then appointed to the post of Commissioner for Oaths in Fiji. He later served as \nFatiaki was previously Chairman of the Fiji Law Reform Commission in 1994 and 1995.\n\nFatiaki's appointment was not without controversy. Then Opposition leader Prem Singh objected on the grounds that in the midst of the Fiji coup of 2000, Fatiaki had joined Tuivaga and Justice Michael Scott in advising the then President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to abrogate the constitution, in accordance with the wishes of the Military. Mara refused, and resigned. The three Justices subsequently recognised the Interim Military Government of Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and drafted decrees abrogating the constitution, abolishing the Supreme Court, making the Chief Justice the President of the Appeal Court, and raising the retirement age of the Chief Justice from 70 years to 75. (These changes were later reversed after a High Court decision reinstating the constitution on 15 November 2000 was upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001. Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, a human rights group, said that Fatiaki's participation in such anticonstitutional actions should disqualify him from holding the office of Chief Justice, and suggested that as the judiciary had been thoroughly compromised politically, it would be best for the time being to appoint a Chief Justice from outside of Fiji (the constitution allows members of the judiciary, unlike other government officials, to be non-citizens, and it is not unusual for retired judges from other Commonwealth countries to be appointed to the bench). Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase disagreed, however, and President Ratu Josefa Iloilo (who had taken office on 13 July 2000) appointed Fatiaki on his advice, saying he was confident that Fatiaki would maintain the same standards of integrity that Tuivaga had upheld.\n\nIn the wake of the military coup that deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006, Commodore Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama, the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and Acting President of Fiji, sent Fatiaki on leave. He told the Fiji Times on 7 January that he had been told to go on leave or be dismissed. Earlier, Fatiaki had said just before the coup that the judiciary would uphold the Fijian constitution and would go down with it if it were abrogated, the Fiji Times quoted him on 5 December (the day of the coup) as having told a conference at the Shangri-La's Fijian Resort in Yanuca, Sigatoka that weekend.\n\nFatiaki condemned as a \"disgrace\" the appointment of Anthony Gates as Acting Chief Justice on 16 January, saying it was unconstitutional and compromised the integrity and independence of the judiciary. He criticised fellow-Judge Nazhat Shameem for her role in the decision, saying that she had unlawfully chaired a meeting of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and written to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo on behalf of the JSC, identifying herself as Chair of the JSC, which is in fact a role reserved for the Chief Justice, recommending the appointment of Gates. He condemned this as a disgraceful and cowardly act, which he denounced as a betrayal of his trust and of the judiciary, and said, contrary to assertions from Shameem and interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, that his leave of absence was forced, not voluntary. Attorney-General Khaiyum said that Shameem had chaired the meeting on his orders, not her own initiative.\n\nIn an act of defiance towards his forced leave and the appointment of Justice Gates as Acting Chief Justice, on 18 January 2007 Justice Fatiaki returned to work at his office, saying in interviews:\n\n\"I have never ceased to be the Chief Justice of this nation. I have decided that the time is right for me to come back and I am no longer going to wait for people to recall me. People are telling me that I'm voluntarily on leave, well lets see...I voluntarily also return to the office.\n\nAt this point in time the acting Chief Justice ceases to function because I'm back in my office. The Chief Justice is back in his office and back heading the judiciary where he belongs.\n\nI don't have guns, all I have is my conscience and power of the rule of law. If this government is true to its word and supports the independence of the judiciary then I have nothing to fear at all.\" \n\nAfter this, a team of RFMF soldiers arrived at his office, asking him to leave the premises, followed by a visit to his chambers by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Jahir Khan along with Police's Elite Tactical Response Team officers. It is understood that Khan asked Justice Fatiaki to voluntarily vacate the chambers, and later escorted him to a police vehicle reportedly to drop him at his Suva residence. Interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum later accused him of having tried to illegally remove from his office documents that are subject to an investigation into his alleged role in the 2000 coup, claims that Fatiaki angrily denied. He could not have removed any documents, he said, as two military officers were with him the entire time.\n\nOn 19 January 2007, it was revealed that President Ratu Josefa Iloilo had signed a decree formally suspending Fatiaki, pending an inquiry into allegations that he had been involved in the 2000 coup, to the extent of drafting decrees and giving legal advice to coup frontman George Speight.\n\nFiji Law Society President Devanesh Sharma condemned Fatiaki's suspension and threatened legal action.\n\nOn 22 January, it was announced that on 10 January, a directive from the Prime Minister's Office had banned Fatiaki from leaving Fiji. Parmesh Chand, the chief executive officer of the Prime Minister's Office, informed the Chief Registrar's Office that while Fatiaki was suspended, he would be banned from attending any meetings or conferences abroad. From 20 to 24 January, he had been scheduled to attend international meetings of jurists in Karachi, Pakistan, and in Perth, Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, Fatiaki announced on 22 January that he was preparing to take legal action against his suspension.\n\nFatiaki formally resigned as Chief Justice on 5 December 2008. This came as a part of a deal with the interim government, under which he would receive a full pension and a F$275,000 payout, the state would discontinue its investigation into allegations of abuse of office and corruption while he was Chief Justice, and he in turn would drop (within seven days) all legal proceedings against the interim government. Both sides undertook not to pursue any future legal action against the other.\n\nIn an address to the convention of the Fiji Law Society at Warwick Hotel on the Coral Coast on 2 July 2005, Fatiaki called on the legal profession to uphold standards of integrity. It was important, he said, for the legal profession to be \"\"independent of any centres of power, whether public or private, and of any cause.\"\" He maintained that the most valuable asset of any profession was its collective reputation.\n\nFatiaki has served as a judge on the Supreme Court of Vanuatu.\n\nDaniel Fatiaki is a Roman Catholic and a native of Rotuma, a Fijian Dependency which enjoys a measure of autonomy but is otherwise integrated into Fiji politically and economically despite its cultural divergence (Rotumans are Polynesian, unlike ethnic Fijians, who are predominantly of Melanesian stock). He is the first Rotuman to be appointed to the bench in Fiji, and his appointment as Chief Justice resulted in great public rejoicing on the island.\n\nFatiaki is the son of Anselmo Fatiaki, who was one of the first Rotumans to graduate from university. He has 5 brothers - Seforana, John, Alec, Joachim, and Christopher. He has one sister named Violet. He is married to Martha and has 4 sons. He was made a Companion of the Order of Fiji, together with Sir Vijay Singh, in 2004.\n"}

Other writers that worked on the album are Scott Storch and Dallas Austin.\n\nDifferent subjects are touched upon on \"Missundaztood\". In \"Don't Let Me Get Me\" she tackles teenage angst and \"Just Like a Pill\" she describes her drug abuse as a teenager. Pink's father was sent to serve in the Vietnam war which made such an impression on her that she used the stories of her father in the song \"My Vietnam\". Towards the end of the song is a sonic interpolation of Jimi Hendrix's \"Star Spangled Banner.\" \"Family Portrait\" tackles divorce and its effects.\n\nAccording to VH1's \"Driven\", Antonio \"LA\" Reid of LaFace Records wasn't initially content with the new music Pink was making, because she had made a name for herself with her successful R&B debut.\n\nAt the 2003 Grammy Awards \"Missundaztood\" was nominated for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" and \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\", respectively. At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Get the Party Started\" won in the categories \"Best Female Video\" and \"Best Dance Video\".\nMany of the songs on the album contain strong language, and the song \"18 Wheeler\" in particular, contained many expletives. However, the album was censored in order to avoid a Parental Advisory warning. No uncensored studio versions of \"18 Wheeler\" exist, but P!nk performs the song uncensored during live performances.\n\nIn the US, three different editions of \"Missundaztood\" were released in total. The first edition was the original version released in 2001 with enhanced content on the disc, which—if placed in a computer— allowed users to listen to the international bonus track \"Catch 22\", and granted access to a photo gallery, sing-alongs, and more. This version of the album also contains the original version of the song \"Misery\", in which P!nk sings the second verse of the song. Future pressings of the album featured Steven Tyler performing the second verse. After some time, all pressings of the album included the new version of \"Misery\" and no enhanced content. This revised version of the album is the one that is still available today (some early pressings of this revised version still mistakenly carried the Enhanced CD logo on the disc and in the album's liner notes). A third version, released in 2002, was a limited edition that included a bonus DVD with two music videos and two live performances. The version of the CD included in the limited edition package is the later pressing with no enhanced content and the revised version of \"Misery\". Both the limited edition with the bonus DVD and the enhanced CD versions have since gone out of print. The album was released outside the US with a slightly shuffled track listing and one extra track, \"Catch 22\".\n\nPink was featured on the cover of several magazines, including:\n\n\nBefore releasing her album she contributed to the \"Moulin Rouge!\" soundtrack. Together with Christina Aguilera, Mýa and Lil' Kim, she re-recorded Patti Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\". Under the supervision of record producer and rapper Missy Elliott, they released the song in April 2001. The song became a huge hit around the world, peaking at #1 in 15 countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. It also earned the 4 artists a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. This was Pink's first Grammy Award. In November of the same year she released her album, Missundaztood.\n\nPink embarked on the Party Tour to promote the album, touring clubs and other venues in the United States. She was also the opening act for 'N Sync on the American and European legs of their tour in 2002.\n\n\"Get the Party Started\", written by Linda Perry, was released as the first single from \"Missundaztood\" in October 2001 in the United States and January 2002 in the United Kingdom. The single charted strongly, reaching number four in the US, number two in the UK, and number one in both Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\"Don't Let Me Get Me\", written by Pink and Dallas Austin, was the album's second single in February 2002. The song reached number six on the UK charts and number eight on the US and Australia charts. It also became the second consecutive number-one single from the album in New Zealand.\n\n\"Just like a Pill\", also written by Pink and Dallas Austin, became the third single in June 2002. It reached number eight in the US and became Pink's first UK number-one single. It also reached number two in New Zealand, but in Australia, the song was a radio-only single, thus it did not chart.\n\n\"Family Portrait\" was written by Pink and Scott Storch, released as the final single from \"Missundaztood\" in December 2002 in North America and January 2003 in Europe. The song peaked at number 20 in the US, number five in New Zealand, and number 11 in the UK and Australia.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a rated mean out of 100 from mainstream critics, the album received a score of 72, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe album debuted at number 8 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 220,000 copies in its first week of release, a higher chart and sales debut than that of Pink's first album, \"Can't Take Me Home\" (2000). The album saw its highest sales week in its fifth week, when it was at number ten, selling 323,000 copies. It sold 73,000 copies in its eighth week and rose to number six on the chart; which became its peak position. It was the second biggest selling album by female artist in 2002, behind Avril Lavigne's debut album \"Let Go\". As of July 2014, it had sold 5,628,000 copies in the US. The album is number 157 on Billboards Top 200 Albums of All Time. In the US, the album has been certified 5x Platinum by the RIAA. Worldwide, the album has sold over 13 million copies.\n\nThe album was released on vinyl for the first time in October 2017, alongside her follow-up album Try This and her debut, Can't Take Me Home.\n\nIn the UK the album peaked at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and eventually manage to sell 1.82 million copies, receiving a 6× Platinum certification The success was so huge that as of November 2006, the album was ranked 94th on the Official Charts Company's all-time best-selling albums list. In 2010 it was ranked the 37th best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK.\n\n!scope=\"row\"|Worldwide\n\n"}

While visiting France in August 1914, he joined the French Foreign Legion shortly after the outbreak of World War I. He was one of the group who signed the American Volunteer Corps flag in Paris on October 17, 1914, before departing for Rouen.\n\nHe served on the Western Front until February 1, 1916, when he was wounded for the second time during a German artillery attack.\n\nZinn transferred to the French Aéronautique Militaire on February 14, 1916. He served as gunner and bombardier with Escadrille F-14 from December 12, 1916, until October 21, 1917, often augmenting his bombing duties by taking reconnaissance photographs of enemy lines before returning to base.\n\nZinn was one of the first aviators to attempt to photograph enemy troop positions from the air to assist commanders on the ground. This had previously been done from manned balloons, but they were vulnerable to enemy fire and had to be kept behind the lines. By flying directly over enemy positions and taking photographs, Zinn provided French commanders with a far better view of the battlefield, and the techniques he and others developed soon became standard practice for both sides in the trench warfare style conflict.\n\nHe was decorated twice by the French government for bravery for flying low over enemy lines on these reconnaissance missions.\n\nAlthough not formally assigned to the American Lafayette Escadrille, Zinn was recorded as an observer for the Escadrille, presumably while taking aerial photographs.\n\nAfter the United States entered the war in 1917, Zinn entered the U.S. Army Air Service as a captain and was attached to American GHQ at Chaumont until the Armistice on November 11, 1918. He was one of a small number of Legionnaires who entered the war in August 1914 to survive over four years of active service and over three full years in combat units. Some French Foreign Legion units had close to 100% casualties in the intense trench warfare.\n\nAt the close of war, Zinn remained in Europe leading a team of what could only be called investigators, with the mission to research, locate, recover and identify American Airmen who were listed as Missing in Action. In Blaine Lee Pardoe's book, Lost Eagles: One Man's Mission to Find Missing Airmen in Two World Wars, which is about Zinn's mission after the war, he notes Zinn was highly successful and credits Zinn with being the \"first person to conceive of the idea that missing men could be found, identified, and brought back to the arms of their country and to the hearts of their surviving families. He pioneered the concept of never leaving a man behind.\" This mission he carried through even after he returned home and to this day, his files in the National Archives are among the most requested. His success and methods were so well known that he was employed during World War ll to find more missing American aviators.\n\nZinn returned to the United States after the war and continued flying, including a trip to San Francisco where his biplane was required to fly only over the waters of San Francisco Bay due to a perceived danger to citizens if it traveled over land.\n\n"}
{"id": "1865269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865269", "title": "Elsie Tanner", "text": "Elsie Tanner\n\nElsie Gregory (also Grimshaw, Howard and Tanner) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", played by Pat Phoenix from the series inception in 1960 to 1973 and from 1976 until 1984. Elsie Tanner was one of the original core characters on \"Coronation Street\" and appeared in the first episode. She is considered something of an icon in soap history and regarded as one of \"Coronation Street's\" greatest ever characters.\n\nHer final appearance came in January 1984, when Elsie emigrated to Portugal. Phoenix decided to quit the series in 1983 to pursue other projects.\n\nThree years after leaving, Phoenix died, and a few months later, in the video \"The Lives and Loves of Elsie Tanner\" Anne Cunningham returned as Elsie's daughter Linda, hinting about Elsie's previous passing and including archive footage for flashbacks. However, 24 years later, when Philip Lowrie returned as Elsie's son Dennis Tanner, it was revealed that Elsie had died in a car accident along with Bill Gregory in 2004/2005, meaning that the video is not part of the canon of the show (on which the events have not been mentioned).\n\nIn 2011, it was revealed that she and her son Dennis were related to Eileen Grimshaw and Julie Carp as her cousin, Arnley Grimshaw, was their grandfather.\n\nElsie is dubbed as the \"siren of the street throughout the 1960s\". She is described as being feisty and bolshy, but with a good heart, and is also said to have a passion for men but get hurt by all of them. In her later years she is described as struggling to keep up her glamour and has a series of sleazy one-night stands and dead-end jobs.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Elsie had two adult children, Linda (Anne Cunningham) and Dennis (Philip Lowrie), from her marriage to Arnold Tanner (Frank Crawshaw).\n\nLinda had trouble with her Polish husband Ivan Cheveski (Ernst Walder) and his short temper, but they eventually reconciled and had two sons, Paul (Victoria Elton, Marcus Saville and Nigel Greaves) and Martin (Jonathan Caplan). \"Coronation Street\"'s creator, Tony Warren, had originally planned the character of Dennis to be rather gritty and a real \"bad boy\", but actor Philip Lowrie's charm and knack for comedy led to Dennis becoming much more lighthearted. Dennis was shown to be sneaky and up to shenanigans, and embarked on many \"get rich quick\" schemes to help himself and his mother.\n\nElsie flirted on and off for years with Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), but that ended when he married Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) in 1977. Even after Len's marriage to Rita, she remained a close friend.\n\nElsie married an ex-lover from the war, American serviceman Steve Tanner in 1967 (played by Canadian actor Paul Maxwell). Due to Elsie's massive popularity during the 1960s, Steve was given the same surname so that Elsie would not have to change her name. Elsie emigrated to America with Steve but returned to Coronation Street after they split up. Steve also returned, attempting to win her back, but was found dead at the bottom of a flight of stairs soon after his return. This led many residents to be in the frame for murdering Steve, but it was later revealed that one of Steve's former Servicemen, Joe Donelli (Shane Rimmer), had committed the crime.\nNow a widow, Elsie married Alan Howard in 1970 (Alan was played by Alan Browning, who would become Patricia Phoenix's real-life husband). This marriage was also rocky; shortly after they married, script-writers bankrupted affluent Alan so Elsie would stay in Weatherfield. Eventually, in 1973, the two went to live in Newcastle-upon-Tyne but Elsie returned alone in 1976 as she and Alan had separated and later got divorced. Elsie was also involved with bookie Dave Smith (Reginald Marsh) in the early 1970s, owner of local football team Weatherfield County FC.\n\nAfter her third failed marriage, Elsie surrounded herself with youngsters and acted as mother figure to Suzie Birchall (Cheryl Murray) and Gail Potter (Helen Worth), who lodged with her during the late 1970s. Elsie saw a lot of herself in young Suzie, who was somewhat gregarious and enjoyed the company of men, but it was Elsie's relationship with Gail that was inevitably the strongest.\n\nDuring her time, Elsie took a diverse range of jobs, including shop worker, croupier, machinist, factory supervisor, café worker and model. At the start of the series, Elsie worked in the department store \"Miami Modes\", before moving on to \"Sylvia's Separates\" dress shop in the 1970s. She also worked under Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) alongside Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn), Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie) and Ida Clough (Helene Palmer) at Baldwin's Casuals clothing factory, where she spent some time as supervisor.\n\nIn late 1983, Bill Gregory (Jack Watson) returned to the Street (she had an affair with him more than twenty years earlier and last saw him in 1970) and confessed to Elsie that he was still in love with her. He asked her to marry him and help him run a wine bar in Portugal. After much agonising and thought, she decided to accept Bill's proposal. On the night she left, Elsie walked down the street and old memories filled her head; squabbles with Annie Walker (Doris Speed) and Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) and fights with her son, Dennis. While clutching photographs of Linda and Dennis, she smiled knowing that her life in Coronation Street had left her with no regrets. As she got into the taxi that was to take her to the train station, the driver asked her if she was to be away for long. Giving him a knowing smile, Elsie replied: \"Ah! Now there's a question!\". The taxi drove off into the night as Elsie left Weatherfield forever.\n\nIn Dorothy Catherine Anger's book \"\"Other worlds: society seen through soap opera\"\" she brands Elsie a \"tarty woman\" who has the ability to \"attract men like bees to honey\". In Larry Warren's book \"Left at East Gate a First Hand\", he joked about the probability of UFO landing being \"as unlikely as Elsie Tanner getting into a nunnery\" and branded her as having dubious morals. In the book \"Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps\", Christine Geraghty describes Elsie as having open family situations to deal with in her later years. She stated that Elsie always seemed ill-equipped to offer other characters advice on their love lives when they needed it.\n\nIn 1983, it was announced that Phoenix would be leaving her role of Elsie and was to leave Weatherfield. Her final appearance was screened at the beginning of 1984. Phoenix died of lung cancer in September 1986 at the age of 62. Elsie, her character, died in a car accident, at the age of 81 in 2004 after leaving Weatherfield 20 years earlier, although it was not mentioned in the show until 2011.\n"}
{"id": "1865277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865277", "title": "In re Aimster Copyright Litigation", "text": "In re Aimster Copyright Litigation\n\nIn re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003), was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed copyright infringement claims brought against Aimster, concluding that a preliminary injunction against the file-sharing service was appropriate, because the copyright owners were likely to prevail on their claims of contributory infringement and the fact that the services was capable of having non-infringing user was not enough reason to reverse the district court's decision. The appellate court also noted that the defendant could have limited the quantity of the infringements if he had eliminated an encryption system feature and if it had monitored the use of its systems. This made it so that the defense did not fall within the safe harbor of 17 U.S.C. § 512(i). and could not be used as an excuse to not know about the infringement. In addition, the court decided that the harm done to the plaintiff was irreparable and outweighed any harm to the defendant created by the injunction.\n\nRecording industry owners of copyrights in musical performances brought contributory and vicarious infringement action, a type of secondary liability, against a website operator called Aimster, a company similar to Napster which facilitated the swapping of digital copies of songs over the internet. \n\nOwners of copyrighted popular music claimed that John Deep (\"Deep\")'s \"Aimster\" Internet service was a contributory and vicarious infringer of these copyrights. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Marvin E. Aspen, Jr., granted preliminary injunction for plaintiffs, which shut down Defendant's service until the suit was resolved, Aimster appealed from this preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n\nThe defendants argued that, unlike Napster, they designed their technology in such a way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. Someone who wanted to use Aimster's basic service for the first time to swap files had to download Aimster's software and then had to register on the system. After doing this he might designate any other registered user called a \"buddy\", with whom he might communicate directly whenever both of them were online, and have the capability of interchanging music files. If the user did not designate any buddies, then all the users of the system became automatically his buddies to share files.\n\nThe court held that in this case the users of the systems were the direct infringers, these who are ignorant or more commonly disdainful of copyright and in any event discount the likelihood of being sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement, however companies such as Aimster that facilitate their infringement, even if they are not themselves direct infringers can be liable for copyright violations as contributory infringers. \n\nThe court analyzed that the copyrighted materials might sometimes be shared between users of such a system without the authorization of the holder of the copyright owner and, in this case, fair-use privilege will not make the Aimster a contributory infringer. As mentioned in the \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\", also known as the \"Betamax\" case, the producer of a product which has substantial noninfringing uses is not a contributory infringer, merely because some of the uses actually made of the product are infringing. In that case, a video reproducer machine called Betamax, the predecessor of today's videocassette recorders was at the issue. The court explained about the sale of the Betamax that the ability of a service provider to prevent its customers from infringing is a factor to be considered in determining whether the provider is or not a contributory infringer. \"In re Aimster Copyright Litig.\", 252 F. Supp. 2d 634, Aimster, however, was not able to produce any evidence that its service had ever been used for a noninfringing purpose, instead the facts showed that Aimster encouraged these infringing activities.\n\nThe court rejected Aimster's argument that to prevail the recording industry should prove that some actual loss of money has occurred because of the copying that Aimster service's contribute in producing. The court explained that although the court, in \"Betamax\", emphasized that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had sustained substantial harm from Sony's video recorder, it did so in the context of assessing the argument that time shifting of television programs was fair use rather than infringement. The court believed that Betamax was not hurting the copyright owners because it was enlarging the audience for their programs, as well as advertisements. However it was also clear that even though without proving economic loss, compensation for damages can not be awarded, plaintiff could still obtain statutory damages and an injunction. \n\nThe Court also rejected Aimster's argument that because the court said in \"Betamax\" that mere \"constructive knowledge\" of infringing uses is not enough for contributory infringement, 464 U.S. at 439, 104 S.Ct. 774, and the encryption feature of Aimster's service prevented Deep from knowing what songs were being copied by the users of his system, Aimster lacked the knowledge of infringing uses that liability for contributory infringement requires. The opinion also makes it clear that a service provider that fits within the characteristics of a contributory infringer does not obtain any sort of immunity by using encryption, to avoid knowledge of the unlawful purposes for which the service is being used. Actually, a tutorial for the Aimster software showed as its only examples of file sharing the sharing of copyrighted works, including copyrighted music that plaintiffs. This fact had implied Aimster continued to be affected by Aimster's users. In this sense the tutorial was nothing but an invitation to infringe this copyrighted music, same invitation that the Supreme Court found could not find in the \"Sony\" case.\n\nWillful blindness is knowledge, in copyright law (where indeed it may be enough that the defendant should have known of the direct infringement, see \"Casella v. Morris\"), as it is in the law generally. Another example is \"Louis Vuitton S.A. v. Lee\", 875 F.2d 584, 590 (7th Cir. 1989) (contributory trademark infringement). The doctrine of willful blindness is established in many criminal statutes, which require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully. Courts have held that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately shielding themselves, from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances, understanding that those who behave in such manner should be treated as those who had actual knowledge.\n\nLastly, the court established that the DMCA § 512 \"safe harbors\" were unavailable because Aimster had done nothing to comply reasonably with Section 512(i)'s requirement to establish a policy to terminate repeat infringers and instead even encouraged repeat infringement.\n\nThe opinion was written by Judge Richard Posner, known for his publications on law and economics, and followed closely on the heels of the Ninth Circuit's decision in \"A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.\"\n\nThe decision of the District Court was affirmed, concluding that a preliminary injunction against the file-sharing service was appropriate.\n\nPetition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865281", "title": "Danbury Trashers", "text": "Danbury Trashers\n\nThe Danbury Trashers are a defunct United Hockey League (UHL) ice hockey team that was located in Danbury, Connecticut. They were first established in 2004 as an expansion team named for their owner's business ventures. James Galante purchased the franchising rights for $500,000 and named his 17-year-old son, A. J., president and General Manager. As part of the franchising agreement, Galante invested an additional $1.5 million to upgrade the team's home arena, Danbury Ice Arena, from a 750-seat facility to a 3,000-seat venue.\n\nIn their first season, the Trashers set a league record for penalty minutes. The season witnessed two separate brawls and multiple player suspensions. Danbury finished second in their division and were eliminated in the playoffs by eventual Colonial Cup champions, the Muskegon Fury. In their second year the Trashers won the Eastern Division and eventually reached the finals. Though they would lose the championship, Danbury handed the Kalamazoo Wings their only loss of the playoffs.\n\nAt the end of the team's second season, Galante was arrested on 72 various charges including conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 87 months of imprisonment, and had to forfeit his ownership interests in 25 trash hauling companies. During the same time the Trashers disbanded, citing financial concerns, including travel costs.\n\nThe Danbury Trashers were founded as an expansion team in the United Hockey League (UHL) on April 1, 2004 by James Galante, a garbage disposal mogul, who paid a $500,000 franchise fee to the league. Galante had considered investing in the New Haven Knights prior to the franchise folding. He purchased the franchising rights after seeing the enthusiasm for hockey in Danbury at his son A. J.'s high school games. He also wanted to give A. J. experience in how to manage a professional sports franchise, naming him president and General Manager. A. J. was a 17-year-old high school student at the time and according to UHL commissioner Richard Brosal some around the league thought it was an April Fools' Day joke. After graduating high school Galante attended Manhattanville College while maintaining his organizational duties.\n\nThe new team was named the Trashers, a reference to the elder Galante's main business, with the logo being designed by A. J.'s friends. The Trashers were to play in the Danbury Ice Arena, a 750-seat ice rink, used for the local hockey leagues. As part of the franchising agreement the arena needed the maximum capacity expanded. Galante invested an additional $1.5 million to renovate the arena, turning it into a 3,000 seat facility.\n\nGalante envisioned a physical team with a \"bad-boy image\" and to become the \"Evil Empire of the UHL\". To that end he brought in tough guys, Garrett Burnett, Rumun Ndur, and Brad Wingfield, who previously set a UHL record for penalty minutes (PIMs) during the 2002–03 season with 576. He also brought in skill players such as, Jim Duhart, who led the UHL in scoring the previous season, former National Hockey League (NHL) player Brent Gretzky, and Michael Rupp, who played for the team during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. For the goaltender Galante acquired Scott Stirling, who was the Most Valuable Player of the ECHL the previous season. As for the coaches, Todd Stirling, son of former New York Islanders head coach Steve Stirling and brother of Scott, was named head coach. A. J.'s former high school head coach was hired as an assistant coach. After the team had been assembled The Hockey News picked the Trashers to finish second in the league.\n\nThe Trashers first season began with the team playing around .500 hockey. Then a quarter of the way through the 2004–05 season they went on a seven-game unbeaten streak that moved them into first place in the Eastern Division. The streak was part of nine consecutive games without a regulation loss. This lifted the Trashers into a tie for first place in the league. The winning streak was also witness to one of two brawls during the season. In a game against the Kalamazoo Wings on December 1, Wingfield attempted to instigate a fight after an altercation with a Wings' player. The player refused to fight, but as Wingfield skated away the player grabbed Wingfield's jersey and pulled him back over an outstretched leg. Wingfield's skate caught on the ice as he fell backwards breaking his ankle. The play incited a brawl, where Ndur fought with two players, attempted to kick a linesman, and charged the Wings bench, before the officials were able to subdue him. His actions led to a 20-game suspension by the league, while the Kalamazoo player received 5 games. Upset with the officiating James Galante went down to ice level to voice his opinion. Galante entered the ice via the penalty box where he got into a shouting match with a linesman and allegedly punched him. For his actions Galante was charged with misdemeanor assault and fined by the UHL for leaving the owner's box. The UHL stated that because of the disturbances on the ice they could not determine what actually happened. The linesman was suspended for five games for his part in the altercation. He later asked that the assault charges against Galante be dropped. After this request prosecutors still intended to pursue the charges, but eventually dropped them citing lack of evidence. After the brawl the Trashers went 8–2–0 in their next 10 games. A second brawl occurred months later in a game versus the Adirondack Frostbite. At the end of the brawl, the Trashers' Chad Wagner was being removed from the ice by the linesmen when he broke away, and attacked the Adirondack bench, grabbing their head coach. Compounding the issue two other Trashers' players left the penalty box and skated towards the bench. A third player sucker punched an opponent, breaking his nose. For his part in the brawl, Wagner was banned from the UHL while the two players, who left the penalty box, received 5 and 10 game suspensions respectively, and the third player was suspended for the remainder of the season and playoffs. Head coach Stirling was also suspended three games for not being able to control his players. It was the sixteenth time the league had suspended a Trashers player. Danbury again found success after the brawl going 8–3–0 in their next 11 games.\nOn February 23, 2005, the Trashers again hosted the Adirondack Frostbite. World Wrestling Entertainment superstar John Cena was on hand for what resembled more of a WWE event than a hockey game. The teams combined for 106 penalty minutes in the first period and 6 game-misconducts were issued in the first 10 minutes of the game. The Danbury Trashers would go on to win the game 4-2.\nThe Trashers struggled towards the end of the season having both a four and three game losing streak and posting a 2–6–2 record. Danbury finished the regular season with 95 points, second place in the Eastern Division, 9 points behind Adirondack. They also set a UHL record PIMs at 2,776. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the Frostbite, winning the series four games to two. In the second round Danbury faced the Muskegon Fury who led the Central division with 111 points. The Trashers were eliminated 4–1, by Muskegon who went on to win the league championship, the Colonial Cup. At season's end the Trashers were announced the winners of the UHL's Merchandiser of the Year Award.\n\nIn the off-season the Trashers changed head coaches, bringing in Paul Gillis, who had coached the Quad City Mallards the previous season. Stirling remained with the team in a scouting and consulting role. They also brought in a new goaltender, Sylvain Daigle, who had won three Colonial Cups with the Fury. Daigle was taken by the Port Huron Flags in an expansion draft and traded to Danbury for their top goal scorer Mike Bayrack. They also reached an agreement to have all of their games broadcast on local ESPN Radio affiliated stations and to have select games broadcast on tape delay locally on Comcast Cable.\n\nThe Trashers began the season with two shootout games, winning one and losing the other. Despite earning three out of a possible four points, Gillis was unhappy with the team's performance. His concerns were later proved accurate as Danbury started the year with a 4–5–2 record. The Trashers hovered around the .500 mark going into December where they started the month with a six-game win streak that brought them within five points of first place in Eastern Division. They finished December without a regulation loss going 11–0–3. Danbury finished the season strong with a seven-game win streak in March and finished the year on a six-game win streak. The winning steaks helped Danbury win the Eastern Division finishing with 107 points, nine ahead of Adirondack.\n\nIn the first round the Trashers faced off against Gillis former team, the Mallards. Although the Trashers began the playoffs as the second seed, they had lost both regular season match-ups with the Mallards. Danbury lost the first two games of the seven game series at home and were facing games 3–5 on the road. The Trashers won games three and four to tie the series before losing game five. Facing elimination Danbury won the final two games to win the series 4–2 and advance to the second round. The second round was a rematch with Muskegon. The Trashers took a 3–2 series lead into game 6, which went to triple-overtime before Danbury finally eliminated the defending champions. In the finals the Trashers faced the Kalamazoo Wings, who had not lost a game in the playoffs. Danbury lost game one of the series, but rebounded to defeat the K-wings in game two. It proved to be the only game that the K-Wings lost that year as they won the next three games to capture the championship. During the finals Daigle set a UHL record for most saves in a single playoff year with 511.\n\nIn June 2006, James Galante was charged with 72 various charges including racketeering. One of the charges that pertained directly to the Trashers was wire fraud, which resulted from the interstate faxing of fraudulent salary cap documents. The Trashers had circumvent the UHLs $275,000 annual salary cap, by giving players or their wives no-show positions within one of the disposal companies or giving them housing allowance checks for sums which had already been paid. Estimates were that the Trashers had exceeded the salary cap by $475,000 making the total payroll closer to $750,000. For his part in aiding with violating the salary cap former head coach Stirling was also charged with wire fraud. He pleaded guilty and was given five years of probation. Galante pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), one count of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, and one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud. He was sentenced to 87 months of imprisonment, had to forfeit his ownership interests in 25 trash hauling companies, a Southbury residence, six racing cars, a trailer used to haul them, and $448,153.10 in cash seized from his business office and home.\n\nAmid the controversy the Trashers disbanded. Adirondack failed to secure an arena lease and disbanded, with their closest geographical competitor gone, Danbury folded over financial concerns, including travel costs. The players from both Danbury and Adirondack were placed into a dispersal draft and selected by the remaining teams in the UHL. The team was replaced by the New England Stars, of the North Eastern Hockey League in 2006.\n\n"}

{"id": "1865327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865327", "title": "Honours degree", "text": "Honours degree\n\nHonours degree has various meanings in the context of different degrees and education systems. Most commonly it refers to a variant of the undergraduate bachelor's degree containing a larger volume of material or a higher standard of study, or both, rather than an \"ordinary\", \"general\" or \"pass\" bachelor's degree. Honours degrees are sometimes indicated by \"Hons\" after the degree abbreviation, with various punctuation according to local custom, e.g. \"BA (Hons)\", \"B.A., Hons\", etc.\n\nExamples of honours degree include the \"honors bachelor's degree\" in the United States, the \"bachelor's degree with honours\" in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and India, the \"honours bachelor's degree\" in Ireland, the \"bachelor with honours\" and \"bachelor honours degree\" in New Zealand, the \"bachelor with honours\" and \"honours bachelor's degree\" in Canada and the \"bachelor honours degree\" in Australia. In South Africa the \"bachelor honours degree\" is a postgraduate degree that follows on from the completion of a bachelor's degree. The undergraduate master of arts degree awarded by the ancient universities of Scotland in place of the bachelor of arts may be awarded as an honours or non-honours degree; these are at the same level as equivalent bachelor's degrees. At master's level, the integrated master's degrees in British universities, which students enter at the same level as bachelor's degrees, are also honours degrees.\n\nMany universities and colleges offer both honours and non-honours bachelor's degrees. In most countries where honours degrees are granted, they imply a higher level of achievement than a non-honours degree.\nIn some countries (e.g. Australia), an honours degree may also involve a longer period of study than a non-honours degree. Students who complete all the requirements for a non-honours bachelor's degree but do not receive sufficient merit to be awarded an honours degree would normally be awarded a non-honours degree (sometimes known as a \"pass\", \"general\" or \"ordinary\" degree), although students who do not complete the requirements for an integrated master's honours degree may receive a bachelor's honours degree. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, almost all bachelor's degrees are awarded as honours degrees; in contrast, honours degrees are rarely awarded in the United States.\n\nThe current British undergraduate degree classification system, with its division into first, upper and lower second, and third class honours, was developed in 1918 to distinguish between students on the basis of their academic achievement. The concept of an \"honours\" degree goes back a lot further than this, however, with there being examinations for honours in the original regulations of the University of London in 1839, and Nevil Maskelyne being recorded as taking a bachelor's degree with honours at Cambridge in 1754. Other countries influenced by this system include Australia, Brunei, Canada, New Zealand, Malta, Singapore, South Africa and Hong Kong.\n\nThe consecutive Australian with-honours degree is usually a one to two-year research program, after the completion of a bachelor's degree in the same field. It can also be started as a concurrent program in the fourth year of a four-year bachelor's degree. It is generally considered a postgraduate year because a bachelor's degree can be completed without it. Entry to an honours degree generally requires proven abilities and a distinction (75% or greater average) in the relevant area or the final-year units, and even then is quite competitive.\n\nIn the regular (standalone) honours, the student will complete selected courses within a supervised program of research (field, laboratory, or secondary), and produce a long, high-quality research thesis. This is usually accompanied by a seminar or presentation of the findings to an academic board for marking. In the case of a quality thesis being produced, its findings may be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal or similar publication. Students receiving high marks in their honours program have the option of continuing to candidature of a doctoral program, such as Doctor of Philosophy, without having to complete a master's degree. Honours can be awarded at up to five levels, depending on the awarding institution, and may be indicated in post-nominals in general as \"(Hons)\":\n\nAt the master's level, Monash University has a \"Master of Business with Honours\" program in which students can be awarded an honours classification upon completion.\n\nIn Canada there are two type of honours degree. Some universities, especially in Ontario, award honours after four years of undergraduate study, instead of the three years of a 'general' bachelor's degree. Examples include Queen's University and York University. In those universities, honours students may undertake an honours thesis.\n\nSome other universities, such as Mcgill University, University of Ottawa, Western University, University of British Columbia, Concordia University and Dalhousie University, require students to undertake an honours project in order to graduate \"with\" honours (Latin \"cum honore\", French \"spécialisé\"). In those universities, honours programmes also require a higher degree of specialization than non-honours 'major' degrees, including a supervised research project or thesis, and students are required to maintain a high academic standard.\n\nThesis-based honours degrees prepare students for research-based postgraduate study, and may sometimes allow direct entry into doctoral programs. A four-year bachelor's degree is required for entry to most postgraduate courses in Canada.\n\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, bachelor's degrees are normally awarded \"with honours\" after three years of study. The bachelor's degree with honours meets the requirements for a higher education qualification at level 6 of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications in full, and is a first-cycle, end-of-cycle award on the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area established by the Bologna process.\nStudents can be awarded an \"ordinary\" degree if they achieve the required learning outcomes over a smaller volume of studies than is required for an honours degree, e.g. only passing 300 credits rather than the 360 usually required for an honours degree. In addition to bachelor's degrees, four-year integrated master's degrees, which combine study at the bachelor's and master's levels, are also awarded with honours.\n\nThe University of Oxford does not award honours with its standard BA degree, but considers students who gain a third class degree or better to have \"achieved honours status\".\n\nUniversities in Hong Kong have four degree classifications: first class, second class upper division (or second class division one/I), second class lower division (or second class division two/II), and third class. Bachelor degrees issued in Hong Kong are honour degrees and are abbreviated as B.Sc. (Hons), B.Eng, (Hons), etc. The University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology follow a GPA scale of 4.3, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong follows a GPA scale of 4.0.\n\nA number of honours degrees are offered by the University of Malta, and the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST), usually indicating an extra year of study with an undergraduate dissertation or a specialisation within a three-year programme.\n\nThe \"bachelor honours degree\" is a separate level on the New Zealand Qualifications Framework from the bachelor's degree without honours, as in Australia and Scotland. It may either be a 4-year (480 credit) course or a single-year (120 credit) course following on from a bachelor's degree, and it prepares students for postgraduate study.\n\nIn Scotland, all undergraduate degrees with honours must be of four-year duration. Students can choose to do the honours degree or the general (or pass/ordinary) degree. The first two years of both types of degrees are the same; however, after that, students who pursue the honours route will complete more advanced subjects and a dissertation in their last year, while students who choose to do the general degree will complete their third year at a lower level of specialisation.\n\nEntry into the honours year in Scotland is generally not restricted and students are encouraged to take the honours year as the general/ordinary/pass degree does not provide the same level of depth and specialisation.\n\nStudents enrolling in the honours program but failing to achieve the required academic merit for honours are awarded a pass/ordinary/general degree.\n\nIn Ireland, honours bachelor's degrees are at level 8 of the National Framework of Qualifications and are Bologna first cycle degrees. They normally follow a three or four year (180-240 ECTS credits) course. The higher diploma may be awarded at the same level following a single year of study (60 ECTS credits) and is normally taken following an honours degree as a conversion course. Ordinary (non-honours) bachelor's degrees are at level 7 of the framework and take three years (180 EFTS credits) to complete.\n\nIn South Africa, non-professional bachelor's degrees (BA, BSc, BCom) are three-year degrees (professional degrees such as engineering degrees or medicine are longer). The honours degree is an optional fourth year and is an additional one-year qualification. Usually the honours degree specialises in one subject matter (e.g., mathematics, English). Intake into the honours degree is often highly selective. The bachelor's degree is at level 7 and the honours degree at level 8 on the National Qualifications Framework of the South African Qualifications Authority. Research components must comprise at least 25% of the honours degree.\n\nIn the United States, an honours degree (or honors degree in US spelling) requires a thesis or project work beyond that needed for the normal bachelor's program. Honours programs in the US are taken alongside the rest of the degree and often have a minimum GPA requirement for entry, which can vary between institutions. Some institutions do not have a separate honours program, but instead refer to bachelor's degrees awarded with Latin honours, which may be based either on GPA or class position, as honours degrees.\n\n"}
{"id": "1865329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865329", "title": "Acalypha", "text": "Acalypha\n\nAcalypha is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is the sole genus of the subtribe Acalyphinae. It is one of the largest euphorb genera, with approximately 450 to 462 species. The genus name \"Acalypha\" is from the Ancient Greek () (\"nettle\"), an alternative form of (), and was inspired by the nettle-like leaves. General common names include copperleaf and three-seeded mercury. Native North American species are generally inconspicuous most of the year until the fall when their stems and foliage turn a distinctive coppery-red.\n\nThe genus is distributed mainly in the tropics and subtropics, with about 60% of species native to the Americas and about 30% in Africa.\n\nThe genus includes annuals or perennial herbs, shrubs, and small trees. Most are monoecious, and some are dioecious. Indumentum of simple hair or glands, rarely of stellate hair. The leaves are alternately arranged, undivided, generally petiolate, stipulate; stipels rarely present at apex of petiole or leaf base, caduceus. The blades entire or more frequently dentate or crenate, pinnately or palmately veined. There are several types of inflorescence, terminal or axillary, frequently both, unisexual or androgynous. Male inflorescences spicate, densely flowered, with several flowers at each node subtended by a minute bract. Female inflorescences generally spicate, sometimes racemose or panicle-shaped, with 1–3(–5) flowers at each node, usually subtended by a large bract, increasing and foliaceous in the fruit, generally dentate or lobed; sometimes subtended by a small bract, entire or lobed, non accrescent in the fruit. Androgynous inflorescences usually with female flowers at proximal nodes and male flower at distal nodes. Flowers unisexual, apetalous, disc absent. Male flowers very small, shortly pedicellate, globose in bud; calyx parted into 4 small valvate sepals; stamens 4–8(–16) on a slightly raised receptacle, filaments free or basally connate; anthers with divaricate or pendulous thecae, unilocular, more or less elongated and later becoming vermiform; pollen grains oblate-spheroidal, with 3–5 pseudopores, tectate, psilate; pistillode absent. Female flowers generally sessile or subsessile, pedicellate in a few species; calyx of 3– (4–5) small sepals imbricate, connate at base; ovary of [1–2]3 carpels, surface often muricate, pubescent or papillose; ovules solitary in each cell, anatropes; styles reddish, free or basally connate, several times divided into filiform segment, rarely bifid or entire; staminodes absent. Fruits capsular, small, 3-lobed, soon dehiscing septicidally into 3 bivalved cocci; generally surrounded by the accrescent female bract. Seeds small, ovoid or ellipsoid, usually carunculate, smooth or foveolate; endosperm present, whitish; the embryo straight; cotyledons broad and flat. Allomorphic female flowers present in some species, generally terminal (sometimes median or basal) in the inflorescences; ebracteate, long pedicellate or subsessile; calyx as in the normal female flowers; ovary and fruits 1-2 locular.\nThe genus \"Acalypha\" was described in the \"Species Plantarum\" by Linné (1753), as belonging to the \"monoecia monadelphia\" class along with other \"Euphorbiaceae\" genera such as \"Croton, Jatropha\" and \"Ricinus\". Previously it was also included in the \"Corollarium Generum Plantarum\" (Linné, 1737). Its definition has been changed very little ever since, and it is confirmed as a natural and well specified genus. In its \"Species Plantarum\", Linné sets forth the first three binominal names, i.e. \"A. virginica\" from North America, and \"A. indica\" and \"A. australis\" from Asia; in 1760 he describes a fourth species: \"A. virgata\" from Jamaica. In the same year, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin, as a result from his journey to Caribbean Sea, writes \"Enumeratio Systematica Plantarum\", in which species \"A. villosa\" and \"A. carthagenensis\" from Colombia, and \"A. corensis\" from Venezuela are described. The first \"Acalypha\" iconographies are also shown in the books by Jacquin; there coloured sheets of \"A. villosa\" (Jacquin, 1776), \"A. alopecuroides\" (Jacquin, 1792), \"A. cuspidata, A. diversifolia\" and \"A. macrostachya\" (Jacquin, 1797) can be found.\n\nUntil the late 18th century the outstanding incorporations to the genus were those from Pehr Forsskål, a Linné student, who sets forth six new species in his \"Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica\" in 1775; and also those from Swedish botanist Olof Swartz, author of \"Nova Genera et Species Plantarum seu Prodromus,\" in 1788, where eight new species are published as a result of a journey around Western Indies. In 1789 Antoine de Jussieu also incorporates \"Acalypha\" in his \"Genera Plantarum\". 19th century going on, Antonio José Cavanilles describes six species from Mexico: these were collected by Luis Née, a botanist from Malaspina Expedition (Cavanilles, 1800). One year later, such species are again included in his book Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum together with some excellent monochrome drawings.\"\n\nIn 1804 and 1816, Jean Louis Marie Poiret makes the first compilation of all \"Acalypha\" known species in the \"Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique\" by Jean Baptiste Lamarck (vol. VI and suppl. IV). There he describes forty species, thirteen of them for the first time. In 1805, Carl Ludwig Willdenow compiles and describes thirty nine \"Acalypha\" species in his \"Species Plantarum\", in which the first classification of genus is made. The species are grouped as to whether they are monoecious or dioecious, and to the position of flowers and inflorescences. As an offspring from the American journey made by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland, twelve new \"Acalypha\" species, from Mexico and Colombia, are described by Sigmund Kunth in \"Nova Genera et Species Plantarum\" (1817, 1825).\n\nIn 1826, Kurt Sprengel compiles fifty eighth \"Acalypha\" species in his \"Systema Vegetabilium\", seven of them brand new. He puts them together under a key with characters similar to those used by Willdenow, finally, the herbaceous species are separated from the woody species. During the first half of the 19th century, many new species are published all around the world, with emphasis on the works by Eduard Poeppig (1841) and George Bentham (1839, 1844) about American species.\n\nIn the French botanist Henri Baillon publication \"Étude générale du groupe des Euphorbiacées\" (1858), a large morphological description of genus is made, and a peculiar classification is presented: two sections are considered –“\"Sect. A\"” and “\"Sect. B\"”– depending on whether the inflorescence axis is simple or branched out, and the female flowers calyx consists of three or five sepals. Baillon continued to publish a series of works under the title \"Euphorbiacées américaines\", to be issued in the first volumes of Adansonia journal, between 1860 and 1864. More than fifty new species of \"Acalypha\" are described thereto, most of them from South America, and specially from Brazil.\n\nJohannes Müller Argoviensis, a Swiss botanist specialist in lichens and director of Geneva herbarium, was entrusted with making a good many \"Euphorbiaceae\", \"Acalypha\"genus included, ready for De Candolle’s \"Prodromus\" (Müller Argoviensis, 1866). As a preparation for that public book, he published in \"Flora\" journal a lot of descriptions of new species based on specimens of Hooker herbarium, at Kew Gardens (Müller Argoviensis, 1864). In such a work, Müller for the first time uses a classification of \"Acalypha\" in two sections, i. e. “\"Linostachys\"” and “\"Euacalypha\"”, names which accompany each of the described species. In 1865, he publishes in Linnaea journal a first revision of genus, in which 164 species are gathered –67 of them first time described– and \"Acalypha\" is formally divided into two sections as above referred. The \"Linostachys\" section is based on the homonymous genus from Klotzsch (1846), and includes seven species with pedicellate male flowers and bracts non-increasing in the fruit. The \"Euacalypha\" section incorporates all 157 remaining species, which have sessile female flowers and bracts increasing in the fruit. This latter section is in turn divided into “\"series\"”, “\"subseries\"”, and finally in groups designated by the symbol “§”, mainly according to the relative positions of male and female flowers in inflorescences and depending on whether these are axillary or terminal, unisexual or bisexual. Finally, in De Candolle’s \"Prodromus\" (Müller Argoviensis, 1866) 30 new species are described, thus raising up to 215 the number of accepted species, which are ordered as per such a complex infrasectional classification. Nearly all names of subgeneric taxa from Müller are illegitimate according to the current rules of International Code of Botanic Nomenclature. Müller Argoviensis was also entrusted with the preparation of \"Acalypha\" for the \"Flora Brasiliensis\" of Martius (Müller Argoviensis, 1874), in which 10 new species are described. There he maintains his two sections, but he does not use the infrasectional classification.\n\nFrom 1867 to 1923 no new proposal is made concerning the classification of the high number of species which genus already consists of. This is, however, a plentiful period in discovery and description of new species: ca. 220 are published. We must highlight the work from John Hutchinson (1913) for \"Flora of Tropical Africa\" by Thiselton-Dyer, where he is dealing with 42 species in modern flower format and, for the first time, he introduces a dichotomous identification key.\n\nIn 1894 Ferdinand Pax, one of the most productive collaborators in the Engler German school, publishes 12 new African species of \"Acalypha\". Pax, and the German botanist Käte Hoffmann, were entrusted with preparing the genus for the enormous \"Das Pflanzenreich\", where all species known in the world so far are gathered and ordered (Pax & Hoffmann, 1924). They deem ca. 390 species as valid ones, of which 81 are first time described. Such a work is considered, even now, as the most complete revision of genus worldwide, and the necessary reference point for any taxonomic or local flora study. The infrageneric classification presented by Pax & Hoffmann is based on that from Müller Argoviensis, except in the rank of subgeneric taxa. Moreover, they use series and section categories in an opposite way to Muller’s: the series are described as higher ranked than sections are. So they divide \"Acalypha\" into three subgenera: \"Linostachys\", \"Androcephala\" and \"Euacalypha\". The subgenus \"Androcephala\", single-typed, includes a species from Madagascar with pedicellate female flowers and capituliform male inflorescences. They divide subgenus \"Linostachys\" into three sections, and subgenus \"Euacalypha\" into 8 series and 39 sections. Pax & Hoffmann consider as “sections” the lower category groups, which Müller designates by the symbol §. According to Grady Webster (1967), such “sections” from Pax & Hoffmann are comparable to subsections or series in other \"Euphorbiaceae\" genera. The last input on \"Acalypha\" from Pax & Hoffmann is published in \"Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien\" by Engler & Prantl (Pax & Hoffmann 1931). It is just a synthesis of the treatment given in \"Das Pflanzenreich\", where all species are classified and listed without any description or key.\n\nIn a general paper on \"Euphorbiaceae\" systematics, Isao Hurusawa (1954) sets forth a new classification, where the rank of infrageneric taxa is even raised and a proposal is made to divide \"Acalypha\" into seven subgenera with 19 sections. Grady Webster (1967), in a study of \"Euphorbiaceae\" genera from Southeastern USA, deems inadequate the treatments given by Pax & Hoffmann and Hurusawa; he thinks that by dividing genus into two sections with many infrasectional taxa, such as presented by Müller, the grade of kinship between \"Acalypha\" species seems to be better outlined. Accordingly, Webster compiles \"Acalypha\" species from the United States into ten series, which are based on corresponding “§” groups from Müller.\n\n\"A. hispida\", the chenille plant or red-hot cat's tail, is cultivated as a houseplant for its interesting flowers. It earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, as has \"A. hispaniolae\", the Hispaniola cat's tail. Others are grown for their foliage and a number of cultivars have been developed, such as \"A. wilkesiana\" 'Obovata Cristata' and \"A. wilkesiana\" 'Hoffmannii'.\n\n\"A. bipartita\" is eaten as a vegetable in some parts of Africa, and it is used in basketry and as animal fodder.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865341", "title": "Clara Barton Parkway", "text": "Clara Barton Parkway\n\nClara Barton Parkway is an automobile parkway in the U.S. state of Maryland and the District of Columbia. The highway runs from MacArthur Boulevard in Carderock, Maryland, east to Canal Road at the Chain Bridge in Washington. Clara Barton Parkway is a two- to four-lane parkway that parallels the Potomac River in southwestern Montgomery County, Maryland, and the far western corner of Washington. The parkway provides access to the communities of Cabin John and Glen Echo and several units of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The Maryland portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was constructed from Carderock past Interstate 495 (I-495) to Glen Echo in the early to mid-1960s. The parkway was proposed to continue west to Great Falls and east to Georgetown. However, these proposals never came to fruition and the parkway was extended only to the Chain Bridge in the early 1970s. The Maryland portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was renamed for Clara Barton, the founder of the American Red Cross, in 1989.\n\nClara Barton Parkway begins at an intersection with MacArthur Boulevard in Carderock. MacArthur Boulevard heads west toward Great Falls and the affluent community of Potomac. Clara Barton Parkway heads east as a two-lane highway that expands to a four-lane divided highway ahead of its diamond interchange with an access road to the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center to the north, which features the David Taylor Model Basin, and Carderock Recreation Area of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Canal to the south. East of the naval lab, the two roadways split for the parkway's six-ramp interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway). There is no direct access from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound I-495 or from southbound I-495 to the eastbound parkway. The parkway roadways come together in Cabin John just west of parking areas accessible from the eastbound direction to C&O Canal Lock 10 and C&O Canal Lock 8 and River Center. Access to Cabin John is provided by a diamond interchange to a road connecting the parkway with MacArthur Boulevard in that community.\n\nClara Barton Parkway reduces to one lane eastbound as it crosses Cabin John Creek and meets Cabin John Parkway at a partial interchange featuring ramps from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound Cabin John Parkway and from Cabin John Parkway to eastbound Clara Barton Parkway, which becomes two lanes again. The parkway continues east to its final interchange, which provides access to MacArthur Boulevard in Glen Echo, the location of Glen Echo Park and Clara Barton National Historic Site. The interchange features a U-turn ramp from the eastbound direction to the westbound lanes of the parkway, a tight right-turn ramp from the access road to westbound Clara Barton Parkway, and an unused bridge over the westbound direction. There is no access from MacArthur Boulevard to the eastbound parkway.\n\nEast of Glen Echo, Clara Barton Parkway reduces to a two-lane undivided highway that closely parallels MacArthur Boulevard on the hillside to the north. The parkway passes a pair of parking areas for Little Falls before temporarily expanding to a four-lane divided highway while passing a third parking area for C&O Canal Lock 6. Clara Barton Parkway crosses Little Falls Branch and enters the District of Columbia before reaching its eastern terminus at an intersection with Canal Road and Chain Bridge Road. Canal Road heads east toward Georgetown while Chain Bridge Road crosses the Chain Bridge into Arlington, Virginia to connect with Virginia State Routes 120 and 123.\n\nCommercial vehicles, including trucks, are prohibited from Clara Barton Parkway without a permit from the National Park Service, which maintains the highway. Speed limits on the parkway are from the western terminus to the Carderock interchange, from the Carderock interchange to the Glen Echo interchange, and from the Glen Echo interchange to the Chain Bridge. Clara Barton Parkway operates as a one-way road between the Glen Echo interchange and its eastern terminus at the Chain Bridge Monday to Friday. Traffic flows eastbound only toward Washington from 6:15 a.m. to 10 a.m. and westbound only toward Glen Echo from 2:45 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. Clara Barton Parkway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length.\n\nCongress approved the construction of parkways on both sides of the Potomac River from Great Falls to Fort Washington and Mount Vernon in Maryland and Virginia, respectively, in 1930. Construction on what was originally named the George Washington Memorial Parkway on the Maryland side of the Potomac River was underway by 1961. The parkway was completed from its western end at MacArthur Boulevard to the interchange with Cabin John Parkway, which was not yet completed, in 1964. In 1965, the parkway opened from Cabin John east to the Glen Echo interchange. Extensions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway were proposed in both directions. From the west end, the parkway was to extend to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park site at Great Falls. Going east, the parkway would continue to Georgetown, where it would tie into the western end of the Whitehurst Freeway at its junction with the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The unused bridge at the Glen Echo interchange was constructed and preliminary infrastructure work was done east of the interchange in anticipation of constructing a second carriageway east toward Georgetown. The plans to extend the parkway to Great Falls and Georgetown were abandoned by 1969. The parkway was completed in its present form from the Glen Echo interchange to the Chain Bridge in 1973. Maryland's version of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was renamed for Clara Barton in 1989.\n\n\nAll of the following are filed under Montgomery County, Maryland:\n"}

Infanteriedivision\") – later known as the 12th Volksgrenadier Division – was a Wehrmacht military unit of Nazi Germany that fought during World War II. The division was formed in 1934. It participated in the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the 1940 campaign in France and the Low Countries. In the Soviet Union, the division joined Operation Barbarossa. The division was destroyed in the Soviet Operation Bagration in the summer of 1944. The division was re-activated in September 1944 and posted to the newly created Western Front.\n\nThe division was formed in 1934 from Pomerania's Mecklenburger population, with its home station being in Schwerin. In order to hide Germany's remilitarisation – a breaking of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles – the unit was codenamed \"Infanterieführer II\" to disguise its size. It did not assume its bona-fide designation until the creation of the Wehrmacht was announced in October 1935, where it was redesignated as the \"12th Infantry Division\". Alongside the name change, \"Lieutenant General\" Wilhelm Ulex was placed in charge of the division, before being replaced by \"Major General\" Albrecht Schubert the following October. Schubert was promoted to \"Lieutenant General\" in March 1938. In November, the command over the 89th Infantry Regiment's 1st Battalion was given to Helmuth Beukemann. In July 1939, the division was moved to Koenigsburg, East Prussia as Germany prepared for the upcoming invasion of Poland, ordered into the 1st Army's I Army Corps.\n\nThe 12th Infantry took part in the invasion of Poland.\n\nDuring the 1940 assault on France and the Low Countries, the division helped beat back an Anglo-French assault on an associated Panzer column in the hopes of relieving troops besieged in Belgium during their full-on retreat. Following the campaign, the division remained stationed in the region until May 1941 in an occupational capacity, when it was ordered to return to East Prussia.\n\nIn June 1941 the division joined Operation Barbarossa under Army Group North as an element of the 16th Army. It took part in Army Group North's capture of the Latvian city of Daugavpils, sweeping north-eastward to Leningrad where it was finally stopped in its tracks during the siege effort. During the early months of 1942, the II Army Corps was subject to a Soviet counteroffensive to relieve Leningrad, resulting in five army divisions (the 12th, included) and the SS-Totenkopf division being encircled along with several other elements of the 16th Army in the Demyansk Pocket. With support from Hermann Göring, planes containing supplies were flown in to aid the divisions while they were in the pocket for some 81 days between 8 February and 20 March. Göring would later gloat about his success in freeing the pocket during the Battle of Stalingrad later that year, when a similar airlift concept was applied. While liberated, the 12th Infantry had left the pocket in a much-weakened state.\n\nIn 1943, with the German Army on the retreat, the division fought in the Belarussian city of Vitebsk. This resulting deterioration of effectiveness led to its capitulation during the Soviets' Summer Offensive in July 1944, soon after Army Group Centre's collapse in Operation Bagration. None of the division's men escaped capture; its commanding officer \"Lieutenant General\" Rudolf Bamler, who had been in command for only a few weeks, was also captured, but later chose to work for the Soviets.\n\nThe division was re-activated in September 1944, where it was sent to the newly created Western Front. Again placed under the command of \"Colonel\" Gerhard Engel, the division – at some point being redesignated the \"12th Volksgrenadier Division\" (German: \"12. Volksgrenadier-division\") – was at a strength of some 12,800 men. With Allied forces approaching the Siegfried Line, the division was made a line division against the Siegfried Line near Aachen. On September 15, elements of the division arrived at the command post of LXXXI Corps where; in the evening they were given orders by the 7th Army to continue the defence of Aachen and to launch a counterattack on the building Allied forces crossing the Ruhr, by first staging near Eschweiler. The following day, elements of the 9th Panzer Division were added to the 12th Volksgrenadier, which was now well-equipped – at least in comparison to other, starving divisions. It then proceeded to take command of the immediate area around Düren. A meeting between chiefs of staff of the 12th Volksgrenadier and the 9th Panzer Divisions took place on the evening to decide on how to plan their joint-attack on the river Mausbach set for the following day.\n\nThe division later saw action in the Western Front in the Ardennes as part of the 6th Panzer Army's I SS-Panzer Corps, where it took part in the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest. On January 1, \"Lieutenant General\" Engel was seriously wounded by Allied forces, and \"Colonel\" Rudolf Langhaeuser assumed temporary command until Engel's return in February. When the offensive failed, the 6th Panzer Army left for Hungary, leaving the division behind to fight off the approaching Americans. The division was encircled near Wuppertal with Army Group B within the Ruhr Pocket. On April 12, \"Major General\" Koenig assumed command of the division, having also assumed command of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division. As the Pocket collapsed, Koenig was captured at Wuppertal on April 18.\n\n\n"}

In June 1941 it joined Operation Barbarossa under Army Group Centre. In September it was transferred to Army Group North, and it spent most of 1942 on the Volkhov Front. In December it was transferred back to Army Group Centre for the relief attempt at the Battle of Velikiye Luki.\n\nIn July 1943 it was redesignated as 20th Panzergrenadier Division; by that time it had been given an assault gun battalion to support its infantry.

In March 1939 the division took part in the invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring World War II the division took part in the invasion of Poland in September 1939 where it was part of the German 4th Army. It then took part in the invasion of France in May 1940. In October that year it returned to Germany and was upgraded to a fully motorized division.

It then fought on the Italian Front until the summer of 1944, when it was transferred to the Western Front to help re-establish the front line after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead. Later in the year, it participated in the Battle of the Bulge and then in the defensive actions at Remagen, ultimately surrendering in the Ruhr Pocket in April 1945, shortly before Victory in Europe Day.\n\n\n\n\nThe division has been implicated in a number of war crimes in Italy between September 1943 and August 1944, when up to twenty-two civilians were executed in each incident.\n\nTwo members of the division, Lieutnant Wolfgang Lehnigk-Emden and NCO Kurt Schuster were sentenced to life in prison in absentia by an Italian court for their role in the Caiazzo massacre, the murder of twenty-two civilians at Caiazzo, near Naples, in October 1943 but not extradited. Lehnigk-Emden was captured by Allied forces during the war, confessed the crime but then released by accident. He was found guilty of manslaughter by the \"Bundesgerichtshof \", Germany's highest court but released because of the Statute of limitations had expired. This caused considerable outrage in both Germany and Italy because of the particularly brutal nature of the crime, and was seen as a Miscarriage of justice.\n\n\n\n"}

Held in reserve, it was one of only two divisions considered \"fully combat effective\" by the Army Group North in July of that year.\n\nThe division was redesignated as 61st Volksgrenadier Division in October 1944, and continued fighting in the East under Army Groups North and Center. Evacuated to East Prussia, the division fought in the so-called Heiligenbeil pocket, caught between the advancing Soviets and the Frisches Haff. Once the \"cauldron\" collapsed in March 1945 the division was written off as a loss and its remaining assets were taken over by the 21st Infantry Division while the division staff was withdrawn to Königsberg, all falling into Soviet hands at the end of the war.\n\nEstablished in August 1939 as part of the second wave.

{"id": "1865366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865366", "title": "Goblet cell", "text": "Goblet cell\n\nGoblet cells are simple columnar goblet shaped like epithelial cells that secrete gel-forming mucins, like mucin MUC5AC. The goblet cells mainly use the merocrine method of secretion, secreting vesicles into a duct, but may use apocrine methods, budding off their secretions, when under stress. The term \"goblet\" refers to the cell's goblet-like shape. The apical portion is shaped like a cup, as it is distended by abundant mucus laden granules; its basal portion lacks these granules and is shaped like a stem.\n\nThe goblet cell is highly polarized with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated at the base of the cell and secretory granules containing mucin, at the apical surface. The apical plasma membrane projects short microvilli to give an increased surface area for secretion.\n\nGoblet cells are typically found in the respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts and are surrounded by other columnar cells. Biased differentiation of airway basal cells in the respiratory epithelium, into goblet cells plays a key role in the excessive mucus production, known as mucus hypersecretion seen in many respiratory diseases, including chronic bronchitis, and asthma.\n\nGoblet cells are found scattered among the epithelial lining of organs, such as the intestinal and respiratory tracts. They are found inside the trachea, bronchi, and larger bronchioles in the respiratory tract, small intestines, the large intestine, and conjunctiva in the upper eyelid. In the conjunctiva goblet cells are a source of mucin in tears and they also secrete different types of mucins onto the ocular surface. In the lacrimal glands, mucus is synthesized by acinar cells instead.\n\nGoblet cells are simple columnar epithelial cells, having a height of four times that of their width. The cytoplasm of goblet cells tends to be displaced toward the basal end of the cell body by the large mucin granules, which accumulate near the apical surface of the cell along the Golgi apparatus, which lies between the granules and the nucleus. This gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum staining with hematoxylin. Mucin within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out in the preparation of microscopy samples. However, they stain easily with the PAS staining method, which colours them magenta.\n\nIn mucicarmine stains, deep red mucin is found within goblet cell bodies. Goblet cells can be seen in the examples below as the larger, more pale cells.\n\nThe main role of goblet cells is to secrete mucus in order to protect the mucous membranes where they are found. Goblet cells accomplish this by secreting mucins, large glycoproteins formed mostly by carbohydrates. The gel-like properties of mucins are given by its glycans (bound carbohydrates) attracting relatively large quantities of water. On the inner surface of the human intestine, it forms a 200 µm thick layer (less in other animals) that lubricates and protects the wall of the organ.\n\nDistinct forms of mucin are produced in different organs: while MUC2 is prevalent in the intestine, MUC5AC and MUC5B are the main forms found in the human airway. In the airway, mucus is swept by the cilia of the respiratory epithelium, in a process called mucociliary clearance, and propelled out of the lungs and into the pharynx, which results in the removal of debris and pathogens from the airway. MUC5AC is overexpressed in allergic lung inflammation.\n\nMucins are continuously made and secreted by goblet cells in order to repair and replace the existing mucus layer. Mucins are stored in granules inside the goblet cells before being released to the lumen of the organ. Mucin secretion in the airway may occur via regulated secretion. Secretion may be stimulated by irritants such as dust and smoke, especially in the airway. Other stimuli are microbes such as viruses and bacteria.\n\nAnomalies in the number of goblet cells are associated with changes in the secretion of mucins, which can result in many of the abnormalities seen in asthma patients, such as clogged airways due to mucus hypersecretion, and eventual loss of lung function. Overexpression of MUC5AC alone does not result in the pathophysiology seen in asthma patients; it is the excessive production along with the speed of secretion that leads to the formation of thick mucus that cannot be removed by cilia or coughing action. This, in addition to airway narrowing leads to the clogging of the airways, which can be detrimental to health if not treated.  \n\nThere are other cells that secrete mucus (such as the foveolar cells of the stomach) but these are distinguished histologically from goblet cells.\n\nOral tolerance is the process by which the immune system is prevented from responding to antigen derived from food products, as peptides from food may pass into the bloodstream via the gut, which would in theory lead to an immune response. A paper published in \"Nature\" in 2012 has shed some light on the process and implicated goblet cells as having a role in the process. It was known that CD103-expressing dendritic cells of the lamina propria had a role to play in the induction of oral tolerance (potentially by inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells), and this paper suggests that the goblet cells act to preferentially deliver antigen to these CD103 dendritic cells.\n\nThe excessive mucus production seen in allergic asthma patients is due to goblet cell metaplasia, the differentiation of airway epithelial cells into mucin producing goblet cells. These cells produce the thick mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B, which clog the airway, leading to the airflow obstruction characteristic of asthma.\n\nGoblet cell metaplasia in allergic asthma is due to the action of the cytokine IL-13. IL-13 binds to the IL-4Rα receptor and initiates a STAT6 signalling response. Binding of IL-13 causes phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the IL-4Rα. This results in docking of STAT6 monomers, which themselves are phosphorylated and then subsequently leave the receptor and congregate form STAT6 homodimers in the cytoplasm. These homodimers then enter the nucleus, where they bind to regulatory elements in the DNA, which affects the transcription of certain genes involved in mucus production.\n\nInduction of STAT6 signaling by IL-13 leads to increased of expression of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO-1), which is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids. 15-lipoxygenase acts by binding to phospholipids and yields hydroperoxy and epoxy metabolites. One such metabolite, 15-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (15-HETE), is released intracellularly, where it conjugates to phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid component. 15-HETE-PE induces expression of the mucin MUC5AC.\n\nGoblet cell carcinoids are a class of rare tumors that form as a result of an excessive proliferation of both goblet and neuroendocrine cells. The majority of these tumors arise in the appendix and may present symptoms similar to the much more common acute appendicitis. The main treatment for localized goblet cells tumors is removal of the appendix, and sometimes removal of the right hemicolon is also performed. Disseminated tumors may require treatment with chemotherapy in addition to surgery.\n\nGoblet cells may be an indication of metaplasia, such as in Barrett's esophagus.\n\nStudies of mice given monoclonal antibodies for IL-13 results in decreased expression of goblet cells in asthma patients. Some treatments that use anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies include tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab. These treatments have shown improvements in asthma patients, yet there are still limitations to the use of anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies. Dupilumab is a newer drug that targets the shared receptor of IL-4 and IL-13, IL4Rα. Since IL-4 and IL-13 have interrelated biological activities, Dupilumab is a more effective form of treatment as it targets both interleukins.\n\nThe cells were first noted by Henle in 1837 when studying the lining of the small intestine, seen to be mucus producing by Leydig in 1857 (who was examining the epidermis of fish), and were given their name by Schulze in 1867, Schulze chose the descriptive name \"goblet\" because of the shape of the cell, rather than a functional name, as he remained uncertain as to the mucous-producing function of the cell.\n\nNowadays these cells are used in the laboratories to evaluate the intestinal absorption of drug targets with different kits, such as the CacoGoblet.\n\n\n"}

I-235 runs from the junction of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 in West Des Moines to the separation of the same two interstates in Ankeny. The highway is approximately long.\n\nI-235, which had seen little improvement since its construction in the 1960s, was completely rebuilt and widened in a project that spanned most of the 2000s. Prior to the reconstruction, I-235 had two lanes in each direction with a third lane near downtown; the entire route now has at least three lanes of traffic in each direction, with an additional one or two lanes closer to the heart of the city. The modernized freeway now handles on average between 75,000–125,000 vehicles per day, making it the busiest highway in the state of Iowa.\n\nInterstate 235 begins at the western intersection of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80, known locally as the West Mixmaster. Here, eastbound I-80 exits the highway, which becomes I-235 and joins northbound I-35. From the West interchange, I-235 heads east. Almost immediately is a half-diamond interchange with 50th Street in West Des Moines. later is a partial-cloverleaf interchange with Valley West Drive, which was renamed from 35th Street in 1988 due to its proximity to Valley West Mall and Valley High School.\n\nAt Windsor Heights at a tight partial-cloverleaf interchange I-235 meets 73rd Street / 8th Street. The interchange is particularly tight because of an Iowa Interstate Railroad line just to the east. 73rd Street / 8th Street is actually a single road: north of I-235, 73rd Street follows the Des Moines street numbering plan, while south of I-235, 8th Street follows the older street numbering plan of West Des Moines. \n\nAt the 63rd Street interchange, I-235 picks up a fourth lane of eastbound travel and drops a lane westbound. Now within the city limits of Des Moines, it passes the through the heavily wooded Waterbury neighborhood. Near the 42nd Street interchange, I-235 curves to the south around Theodore Roosevelt High School. later is an interchange with 31st Street, which provides access to Drake University to the north, and to Terrace Hill, the governor's mansion, to the south.\n\nEast of 31st Street, I-235 briefly picks up a fifth lane and drops a lane westbound, creating a 10-lane freeway just west of downtown. This stretch of freeway receives, on average, over 125,000 vehicles per day, making it the busiest stretch of road in the state. \n\nThere are three eastbound interchanges connecting I-235 to downtown Des Moines. Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and 19th Street, a pair of one-way streets, lead traffic to the west of downtown. Keosauqua Way, known locally as Keo Way, enters downtown from the northwest. These interchanges are combined westbound. Closer to the Des Moines River, a combined interchange in each direction filters off the rest of downtown traffic to two destinations: Seventh Street and Sixth Avenue, and Third Street and Second Avenue, each of which are pairs of one-way streets. The fourth lane of traffic drops off at this combined interchange.\n\nAt the Des Moines River, I-235 passes Wells Fargo Arena, the main Iowa Events Center facility, which lies to the south along the western bank and the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden to the north on the eastern bank. On the eastern side of Des Moines, it skirts the northern edge of the East Village, the Iowa State Capitol, and East High School before the interchange with U.S. Route 69. east is an interchange with East University Avenue, which, up to now had been relatively parallel to I-235. East University provides access to the Iowa State Fairgrounds for northbound I-35 and eastbound I-80 traffic.\n\nAt University Avenue, I-235 begins curving to the north, dividing an industrial district to the west and residential areas to the east. to the north, it intersects East Euclid Avenue at a partial-cloverleaf interchange. It continues north for another until it meets Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 again at the East interchange.\n\nThe first section of Interstate 235 to open, from Cottage Grove Avenue to Keo Way, opened on December 14, 1961. Over the next seven years, sections of I-235 opened, spreading east and west toward the interchanges until it was completed on October 30, 1968.\n\nIn October 1963, the Des Moines city council designated I-235 the \"John MacVicar Freeway\" in honor of two former mayors of Des Moines: John MacVicar, Sr., (1896–1900, 1916–1918, 1928) and John MacVicar, Jr., (1942–1948). However, this name is seldom used; most people simply refer to it as I-235.\n\nIn March 2002, a six-year-long project to completely rebuild I-235 and the bridges which cross it began. The first two years consisted of rebuilding most of the bridges which cross it, starting with 42nd Street in West Des Moines. The final four years of the project entailed finishing the remaining bridges, widening, regrading, and repaving the entire length of the highway.\nAn additional part of the highway improvement plan were three pedestrian bridges, located at 40th, 44th, and East 6th Streets. The three bridges were replacements for bridges which were too narrow to accommodate the newly widened highway. These highly visible bridges act as icons, locating the neighborhoods for travelers along the freeway. The design of the I-235 pedestrian bridges was completed by Boston-based bridge designer Miguel Rosales in collaboration with HNTB Engineering. The three bridges, the Edna M. Griffin Memorial Bridge (East 6th Street), the 40th Street Pedestrian Bridge, and the Rider Way Pedestrian Bridge (44th Street) were each completed by 2005.\n\nThe new design utilizes basket-handle steel arches with clear spans of approximately . Inclined cables connect the steel blue arches to the pre-stressed concrete deck. By selecting a tied arch form, the Iowa Department of Transportation was able to keep disruption of traffic to a minimum during construction. An innovative curved screen system is used to enhance security and the appearance of the structure creating a visually appealing experience for pedestrians and bicyclists using the bridge. The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state.\n\n"}

Politically it belongs to the municipality of La Oliva on the island of Fuerteventura. It has an area of . It has been a nature reserve (\"Parque Natural del Islote de Lobos\") since 1982.\n\nThe island is accessible to tourists via a short ferry ride from Corralejo, in the north of Fuerteventura. It has day facilities and weekend homes of local fishermen. At the northeastern end of the island is the Punta Martiño Lighthouse, the lighthouse keeper and his family were the last permanent inhabitants of Lobos, until the light was automated in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1405, Lobos Island served as resupply base for Jean de Béthencourt's conquest of Fuerteventura.\n\nLobos Island (Wolves Island) was named for the large number of sea wolves, also called monk seals, that once lived there. The monk seals were the island's only inhabitants when it was discovered by the Spanish conquerors of the Canaries archipelago in the fifteenth century, but with the arrival of man, these animals were hunted on a massive scale by sailors and fishermen who saw them as a source of food, fat and skin. As a result of this hunting, the species eventually became extinct on the island and its presence now is only occasional.\n\nRecent archaeological findings have concluded that Ancient Rome established a (possibly seasonal) settlement in the island, related with the obtention of purple dye.\n\nIn 1405 Lobos Island served as resupply base for Jean de Béthencourt´s conquest of Fuerteventura. Until 1968 the only inhabitants of the island were the lighthouse keeper and his family, who had the responsibility for operating the Faro de Lobos lighthouse located at Punta Martiño at the northern tip of the island, a prominent local landmark (his name was Antonito; a school in the town of Corralejo was named after him). The island was one of the first natural areas of the Canary Islands to be designated as a natural park in 1982. Later the island was also designated an area of special protection for birds, and many marine species of migratory birds inhabit the island.\n\nLobos Island, like the rest of the Canary Islands, is a volcanic island. Its age is estimated between 6,000 and 8,000 years. The highest point is on the island's volcanic caldera, Montaña La Caldera, above sea level. The island includes a small lake, but the low rainfall creates an arid landscape.\n\nDespite being a desert and a volcanic landscape, Lobos Island has a large number of natural habitats. There are over 130 plant species, including the siempreviva (\"Limonium ovalifolium\"), which is endemic to the island, and the Sea Uvilla (\"Tetraena fontanesii\") which is very attractive because of its shape and color.\n\nLikewise, birds are an important feature of the island: it has a great variety of seabirds that usually nest on cliffs and rocks. Among these species are the shearwater Cinderella, little shearwater and the herring gull. Also in residence are the storm petrel, Bulwer's petrel and yellow-legged gull. In addition to birds a great diversity of fish can be spotted in its waters. Of these abound old fish (Canarian fish), barracuda, hammerhead shark, bream and striped fish.\n\nBecause of its great ecological diversity the site has been designated as a protected zone, the \"Parque Natural del Islote de Lobos\". It has also been declared a special protection area (SPA) for birds.\n\nThe island is a popular location for day trips for tourists visiting from Fuerteventura who have an interest in flora, fauna and geology.\nRegular boat services ferry passengers from Corralejo harbour during daylight hours. To protect the natural landscape from human impact, access is limited to restricted areas and to a series of walking trails, marked by directional signs to protect the conservation areas. The paths take visitors from the boat jetty through a varied landscape, including to the lighthouse at Punto Martino and to the top of the caldera. There is a small, sheltered sea lagoon, Playa de la Concha, with a sandy beach for bathing.\n\nVisitors, before 2007, could ask for authorisation from Fuerteventura local government's environment office to camp on the island, for a maximum of three nights, in one permitted location known as \"El carpintero\" (the carpenter's). Since 2007 it is prohibited to camp on the island.\n\n"}

His good conduct during the engagement was recognised by Rodney, who promoted Carnegie to commander and then aided his rise to Post captain in 1782, whereupon he was given command of the frigate .\n\nTen years later at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, on 22 January 1792, Carnegie had acceded to the earldom and became the Earl of Northesk. He was given a new ship of the line to command in 1796 and having as his first lieutenant Charles Bullen, the start of an excellent professional partnership and close personal friendship. The following year he was caught up in the Nore mutiny but was released by the mutineers to take their demands to London. Like many in the fleet, Northesk had some sympathy with the initial stages of the mutiny, and so when the demands were refused, he resigned his position as untenable following his failure to restore order on his ship or gain concessions from the government.\n\nReinstated by the Admiralty in 1803 with full seniority as a rear-admiral, Northesk was given the 100 gun first rate as his flagship, and after a brief period in the Channel Fleet, was sent south with Sir Robert Calder to join the blockading squadrons off Spain. With him went Captain Bullen. He missed the Calder's action in 1805, and joined Nelson's fleet off Cadiz that same year.\n\nAs the inevitable Battle off Cape Trafalgar came closer, Northesk was largely left out of the planning of the encounter, partly because he was the third most senior admiral present behind Nelson and Collingwood and partly because unlike most of the captains at the battle, Northesk had never worked with Nelson before and was not a member of the famous \"Band of Brothers\".\n\nNonetheless, when battle came Northesk was ready and although his slow ship took some time to reach the fighting, he was heavily engaged with the enormous Spanish 130 gun ship \"Santissima Trinidad\", the \"Britannia\" suffering 52 casualties in the battle. He was greatly rewarded for his service in action, but like many Trafalgar captains, never served at sea again as sufficiently senior posts could not be found abroad. He was however initiated into the Order of the Bath, eventually reaching the position of Knight Grand Cross. He also reached the rank of full admiral, the ceremonial post of \"Rear-Admiral of Great Britain\" and was made Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth later in his career.\n\nHe died in 1831 in London and was buried alongside Nelson and Collingwood in the crypt at St Paul's Cathedral, where his tomb can still be seen.\n\nHe married Mary Ricketts, daughter of William Henry Ricketts, on 9 December 1788 and had nine children:\n\n\n"}

It is computed by dividing the system's total fare revenue by its total operating expenses.\n\nThere are generally two types of fare structures: a simple, flat rate fare structure (pay a fixed fare regardless of time of day and/or travel distance) or a complex, variable rate fare structure (pay a variable fare depending on time of day and/or travel distance). A variable fare structure is typically associated with a higher recovery ratio, though it may simply be the case that such systems are implemented only on more profitable networks or modes such as commuter rail. Variable-rate fares require a higher initial investment in fare ticketing technologies such as the use of contactless smart cards, turnstiles or fare gates, automated ticket machines, as well as IT infrastructure.\n\nThe farebox recovery ratio is the ratio of fare revenue to total transport expenses for a given system. These two figures can be found in the financial statements of the operators. Oftentimes the operator runs multiple modes of transport (e.g. subway and bus), and there is no data for individual modes (segment analysis). In this case the operator is considered as one system, or a group of modes are collectively considered one system.\n\nFare revenue is not the same as \"transport\" or \"operational\" revenue, as there are often secondary sources of revenue such as lockers and paid restrooms. Fare revenue is a subset of transport revenue, which is in turn part of total revenue along with \"non-transport\" or \"non-operational\" revenue.\n\nTotal \"transport\" or \"operational\" expenses are a part of total expenses along with \"non-transport\" or \"non-operational\" expenses.

The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" scored the Genesis version a 5.875 out of 10, criticizing the choppy animation, limited number of moves, and most especially the poor controls, which they said made executing special moves \"too much work to be any fun.\" \"GamePro\" gave negative reviews to both the Genesis and SNES versions, similarly citing poor controls, unimpressive special moves, and sprites which look good in still frame but ugly in animation.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed both ports of the game and gave them two out of five stars. For the Genesis, they stated, \"squint your eyes and you could swear you're playing any of the other many fighting games, that doesn't mean \"Justice League\" is awful, it's just real normal.\" For the SNES version: \"comic book fans and fighting fans should get a kick out of it, but everyone else is likely to yawn.\"\n\n"}

Rodale\n\nJerome Irving Rodale (; August 16, 1898 – June 8, 1971) was a publisher, editor, author, playwright, and founder of Rodale, Inc.\n\nRodale was an early advocate of sustainable agriculture and organic farming in the United States. As an author, his work included several magazines and books, including books featuring different authors, on the subject of health. He popularized the term \"organic\" as a term for growing food without pesticides. Rodale also published works on other topics, including \"The Synonym Finder\".\n\nRodale died after suffering a fatal heart attack while appearing as a guest on a segment of \"The Dick Cavett Show.\" The segment has not been aired. Rodale was taken to Roosevelt Hospital Center and was pronounced dead on arrival at the age of 72.\n\nRodale was born in Manhattan on August 16, 1898, the son of a grocer, and raised on the Lower East Side. His birth name was Cohen, but presuming it would be a handicap in business, he changed it to a non-Jewish-sounding one. He worked as an accountant for New York City 1917-1920, and worked for the Internal Revenue Service 1920-21. His brother Joseph and he co-founded Rodale Manufacturing, a maker of electrical equipment, in New York in 1923. He married Anna Andrews in 1927, she died in 2000 at 95. and had three children: Robert Rodale (1930–1990), Nina Rodale (who married Robert Hale Horstman and then married Arthur Houghton), and Ruth Rodale. Rodale was already concerned with his health at this time, as he had frequent heart murmurs and had been rejected from the Army in World War I for bad eyesight. To improve his health, he read the works of Bernarr Macfadden and invented an exercising device. \nThe Rodale brothers moved Rodale Manufacturing to Emmaus, Pennsylvania, in 1930 to cut costs during the Depression. He founded Rodale Press in 1930, marketing books and magazines. Inspired by his encounter with the ideas of Albert Howard, Rodale developed an interest in promoting a healthy and active lifestyle that emphasized organically grown foods, and established the Rodale Organic Gardening Experimental Farm in 1940. Rodale Press started publishing \"Organic Farming and Gardening\" magazine in 1942. \"Organic Farming and Gardening\" promotes organic horticulture; later, the magazine was retitled \"Organic Gardening\". To Rodale, agriculture and health were inseparable. Healthy soil required compost and eschewing pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Eating plants grown in such soil would then help humans stay healthier, he expounded.\n\nOne of Rodale's most successful projects was \"Prevention\" magazine, founded in 1950, which promotes practices preventing disease rather than trying to cure it later. It pioneered the return to whole grains, unrefined sweets, using little fat in food preparation, folk cures, herbal medicines, and breastfeeding. It also promoted the consumption of higher than typical amounts of nutritional supplements and forgoing nicotine and caffeine. Rodale opposed the consumption of milk and sugar, which he blamed on causing many diseases. He was not a vegetarian and frequently denounced vegetarianism.\n\nRodale was also a playwright, operating the Cecilwood Theater in Fishkill, New York, and the off-Broadway Rodale Theater at 62 East Fourth Street in the East Village. Rodale's plays included \"Toinette\" (1961) and \"The Hairy Falsetto\" (1964).\n\nRodale died of a heart attack at the age of 72 while participating as a guest on an early-evening taping of \"The Dick Cavett Show\" slated to be aired that same night, Tuesday, June 8, 1971. Rodale was still on stage, having finished his interview, and was seated on a couch next to the active interviewee, \"New York Post\" columnist Pete Hamill. Rodale had stated during his just-completed interview on the show, \"I'm in such good health that I fell down a long flight of stairs yesterday and I laughed all the way\", \"I've decided to live to be a hundred\", and \"I never felt better in my life!\" He had also previously said, \"I'm going to live to be 100, unless I'm run down by some sugar-crazed taxi driver.\"\n\nAccording to Dick Cavett, Hamill noticed something was wrong with Rodale, leaned over to Cavett, and said, \"This looks bad.\" According to others, Cavett asked, \"Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?\" Cavett himself said that he \"emphatically\" did not recall saying this, but one of the two physicians in the audience did remember this. The physicians (an internist and orthopedic surgeon, both in residency) rushed onto the stage to try to revive Rodale with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. (During an appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" that originally aired on February 5, 1982, Cavett stated \"firefighters from across the street\" also attended the patient.) Although an electrocardiogram continued to show cardiac activity, they were unsuccessful; Rodale was pronounced dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. The episode was never broadcast, although Cavett has described the story in public appearances and on his blog.\n\nAfter Rodale's death, his son Robert Rodale ran the publishing firm until his own death in a car accident in 1990. That work included editing the high-circulation \"Prevention\" magazine. Robert Rodale had competed in the Olympics in rifle shooting and was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nRodale's granddaughter Maria Rodale became chairman and CEO of Rodale, Inc. She attributes her interest in the organic food movement to growing up on America's first certified organic farm.\nIn October 2017 New York media giant Hearst Corp. announced it would acquire the magazine and book businesses of the 90-year-old Rodale Inc. for an undisclosed price.\n\nMedical experts have described Rodale as a promoter of quackery. For example, Rodale accused sugar of \"causing criminals\", and blamed various diseases including bronchitis and pneumonia on the consumption of bread. He also believed that consumers of cola drinks would become sterile.\n\nRodale was an anti-vaccinationist. He also made dubious claims about cancer. In his book \"Happy People Rarely Get Cancer\" (1970), Rodale stated that \"Negroes get less cancer than whites, for the Negro is a happy race. True, there is their problem of segregation, but the Negro race being what it is, I think a Negro sings just the same, and is not going to let segregation dampen his spirits as much as a similar problem would do to the white person.\"\n\nIt was reported that Rodale took seventy food supplements every day. He was criticized for promoting dubious claims about vitamins supplements. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch commented that the \"Prevention\" magazine was filled with \"nonsense promoting dietary supplements... many articles contained therapeutic claims that would be illegal on product labels.\"\n\nThe \"Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America\", noted that the agricultural establishment \"dismissed Rodale as a quack, crank, a gadfly, and a manure-pile worshiper.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is the only child of Yale mathematician Shizuo Kakutani and his wife Keiko (\"Kay\") Uchida. Her father was born in Japan, her mother was a second-generation Japanese-American who was raised in Berkeley, California. Michiko received her B.A. in English literature from Yale University in 1976, where she studied under author and Yale writing professor John Hersey, among others.\n\nKakutani initially worked as a reporter for \"The Washington Post\", and then from 1977 to 1979 for \"Time\" magazine, where Hersey had worked. In 1979, she joined \"The New York Times\" as a reporter.\n\nKakutani worked as a literary critic for \"The New York Times\" from 1983 until her retirement in 2017. Her periodically harsh reviews of some prominent authors have garnered both attention and, on occasion, criticism. For example, in 2006, Kakutani called Jonathan Franzen's \"The Discomfort Zone\" \"an odious self-portrait of the artist as a young jackass\". Franzen reportedly subsequently called Kakutani \"the stupidest person in New York City\". Another example is that, in 2012, Kakutani wrote a negative review of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's \"Antifragile\". In 2018, Taleb stated in his book \"Skin in the Game\" that \"someone has to have read the book to notice that a reviewer is full of baloney, so in the absence of skin in the game, reviewers such as Michiko Kakutani\" can \"go on forever without anyone knowing\" that they are fabricating and drunk.

Broken into 2 designations, it serves as a bypass of Wilmington; providing a direct route between the Grand Strand and I-40. Officially known as the John Jay Burney Jr. Freeway, it is also known as the Wilmington Outer Loop, Wilmington Bypass and Northern Outer Loop. I-140 is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs between U.S. Route 17 (US 17) near Leland to I-40 near Murraysville. NC 140 travels between I-40 and US 17 in Kirkland.\n\nI-140 begins at a trumpet interchange with US 17 west of downtown Wilmington. From there, it heads north, meeting US 74/US 76. Turning east, it interchanges with Mount Misery Road and Cedar Hill Road. It then crosses the Cape Fear River before interchanging with US 421. Continuing past US 421, I-140 continues in a northeasterly direction where it crosses the Northeast Cape Fear River on the Dan Cameron Bridge. After crossing the river, the route travels in an easterly direction where it meets NC 133 at a folded diamond interchange in Wrightsboro. From NC 133, I-140 continues to the east en route to its eastern terminus in Murraysville at an interchange with I-40, a partial cloverleaf interchange with a flyover ramp from eastbound I-140 to westbound I-40. Here, I-140 ends and the road continues east as NC 140 through an undeveloped wooded area. After passing through the construction area for an interchange with the proposed NC 417 (Military Cutoff Road), NC 140 ends as US 17 merges into the road from a trumpet interchange in Kirkland.\n\nThe most notable feature of the existing route is the bridge spanning the Northeast Cape Fear River. The bridge measures in length with a main span of and of vertical clearance above the river, Rat Island and adjacent marshlands. Its construction consists of precast girders with cast-in-place decks leading to the main span consisting of cast-in-place cantilevered box girder elements. In November 2005, the North Carolina Board of Transportation voted unanimously to name the I-140 bridge across the Northeast Cape Fear River in honor of former Wilmington mayor and businessman Dan Cameron.\n\nIn an effort to protect scenic viewsheds for motorists utilizing the freeway, the Special Highway Overlay District of the New Hanover County Zoning Ordinance was adopted by the County Commission in June 2001. Some of the restrictions of the overlay include the banning the construction of billboards, limiting outdoor storage and increasing setback requirements for structures adjacent to the roadway. Only nine applications for billboards along I-140 were processed and approved prior to its passage.\n\nI-140/NC 140 feature three dedicated or memorialized stretches of freeway.\n\nNCDOT may have tried two attempts to add I-140 in the state. The first appeared in the 1976 AAA map showing a proposed designation of I-140 between Beaucatcher Tunnel (US 70) and I-40 in east Asheville. The following year, the designation was changed to I-240, which would continue through Beaucatcher Tunnel (eventually through the Beaucatcher Cut when established) and replacing NC 191 to reconnect with I-40. It has not been confirmed if NCDOT actually submitted a request or not with AASHTO.\n\nThe second and confirmed preliminary designation was in 1999, when NCDOT submitted a request to AASHTO to designate of US 1 from I-40, in Raleigh, heading westerly to the future US 421 (Sanford Bypass) interchange, in Sanford. On April 17, 1999, the request was disapproved by the committee and has since been dropped.\n\nThe idea of constructing a northern bypass for Wilmington was initially identified by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as a need in 1972. The outer loop was viewed as a means to help relieve traffic congestion along Market Street and the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge through central Wilmington in New Hanover County serving as both an additional crossing of the Cape Fear River and providing for better regional connectivity. However, the project was not included as part of the department's construction schedule until 1989. In 1991, NCDOT initiated the evaluation of a pair of proposed routes for the Northern Outer Loop. The northern routing was to have been approximately in length and resulted in the relocation of 19 homes, 19 businesses, traversed of wetlands, nine potential hazardous waste sites and five historic sites. The southern routing was to have been approximately in length and resulted in the relocation of 58 homes, 8 businesses, traversed of wetlands, seven potential hazardous waste sites and eight historic sites.\n\nIn November 1994, North Carolina Board of Transportation elected to move forward with the southern routing. The initial link between I-40 and US 421 was originally to begin construction in 1998 and open by 2001. Due to significant opposition by both local residents and officials, NCDOT unveiled a revised routing in April 1996 that located the route north of the initial proposal. This revised \"central route\" was selected as the final routing by NCDOT in April 1997. At the time of its announcement, the route was estimated to cost $126.5 million to complete and result in the displacement of 20 homes, 8 businesses, the loss of of wetlands and the loss of of farmland lost. Planning would continue through the late 1990s culminating with the first contract awarded for its construction in November 2000 for the I-40 interchange.\n\nIn 1997 local officials initially stated that an interstate designation was sought for the bypass. In September 2002, the Federal Highway Administration announced that it would grant NCDOT's request and designate the Northern Outer Loop as Interstate 140. The designation was to apply to the initial western segment constructed between I-40 and US 421 and the initial eastern segment constructed between I-40 and US 17. At the time of its announcement, the designation was touted as a significant means to enhance economic development opportunities along its route in addition to potentially serving as a tie-in for moving the proposed eastern terminus of Interstate 74 from Myrtle Beach to Wilmington. Later that month, it was announced the segment east of I-40, would be named the John J. Burney Freeway after the state senator and trustee of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.\n\nThe initial $36.7 million contract for construction of a segment of the eastern leg was awarded by NCDOT to Barnhill Contracting Company in November 2003. Its construction had been delayed due to several conflicts including the handling of stormwater runoff into Futch Creek and a slight redesign of an off-ramp at the Porters Neck Road interchange to avoid a 450-year-old oak tree. Construction of the eastern segment commenced on December 29, 2003. As late as May 2005, NCDOT remained undecided as to whether or not to open only a portion of the road prior to completion of the elevated section due to the bridge section running behind schedule. By summer NCDOT decided to open the first segment of I-140 to traffic on August 22, 2005. Formally dedicated with Governor Mike Easley and U.S. Representative Mike McIntyre in attendance, the segment was located between I-40 and NC 133 (Castle Hayne Road).\n\nIn June 2006, NCDOT announced two additional segments of the I-140 project would open by the end of the month. Costing $187 million to complete, the US 17 expressway segment between Porters Neck Road and I-40 and the segment between NC 133 and US 421 both opened to traffic on June 30, 2006. Concurrent with its opening, the routing of US 17 through Wilmington was also moved to the newly opened expressway. The previous routing of US 17 through Wilmington was changed to U.S. Highway 17 Business, and the US 17 Truck designation was removed from Military Cutoff Road and Oleander Drive upon the opening of the bypass with through trucks being directed to utilize the newly constructed freeway.\n\nOriginally, the freeway was scheduled to be extended from its current terminus at US 421 to US 74-76 first. Construction began on this leg in 2014 and is scheduled to be the final segment of the route to open in 2017. The route was opened on December 15, 2017.\n\nIn 2009, NCDOT announced plans to complete the southern portion of the western leg instead of the central portion requiring construction of a bridge across the Cape Fear River. In response to this decision, city leaders from the town of Navassa filed a discrimination complaint against NCDOT claiming the town is frequently denied funding for infrastructure improvements and other projects. Planning for future construction continued, and in March 2010 NCDOT awarded an $81.7 million contract to Barnhill Contracting Company. The project involved the construction of the segment between the US 74/76 intersection and US 17 south of Leland. Construction of the segment began in March 2010 as a result of receiving partial funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nAs part of the expansion into Brunswick County, NCDOT designed several wildlife crossings to allow for the black bear and other animals to safely cross the corridor in the vicinity of the Battle Royal Natural Heritage Site. The crossings included the extension of four bridges to provide some upland areas from animal crossings along water bodies and the construction of a by wildlife tunnel just north of the US 74-76 interchange. This section of freeway was opened to traffic in September 2014.\n\nWith the opening of the Brunswick segment, a new designation appeared, North Carolina Highway 140 (NC 140). On January 14, 2015, the Certification of Rulemaking was released confirming the establishment of the new designation along, not only the Brunswick segment, but all existing and future sections of the Wilmington bypass. The justification in the paperwork for using NC 140 was it would serve as a temporary designation until the entire bypass was complete and the remaining segments could be submitted to AASHTO approval as I-140. The other rationalization was to provide an alternate designation for the entire Bypass if a proposal by NCDOT to return US 17 to the streets of Wilmington was enacted since only on the New Hanover segment is I-140 concurrent with US 17. NCDOT officials in the summer of 2014 called for returning US 17 to its original routing through Wilmington on Market Street, with the exception of placing a part of it on Military Cutoff Road and Oleander Drive, due to traffic volume on these roads being large enough to merit a route designation, which neither of these roads had. The proposal was endorsed by the Wilmington area Transportation Advisory Committee in August 2014. AASHTO's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering approved the request on May 14, 2015. On May 17, 2017, US 17 was officially rerouted through Wilmington again.\n\nOn December 15, 2017, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held for the final section of I-140 between US 74/US 76 and US 421. However, the segment of road did not officially open to traffic until December 19, 2017, due to the road requiring final construction and cleanup, officially completing I-140 around Wilmington. The section cost $204 million and included two bridges over the Cape Fear River, with of stone and of fill material. Once completed, I-140 was extended west to replace NC 140 between US 17 and US 74/US 76.\n\nIn 2002, the North Carolina Board of Transportation appropriated $10 million for the construction of an interchange at Blue Clay Road. The interchange would serve in providing better access to both Wilmington International Airport and the Cape Fear Community College North Campus, and will be constructed sometime in the unspecified future.\n\nAn interchange is currently being constructed with the proposed NC 417 as part of the extension of Military Cutoff Road. Construction began in 2017 and the interchange is expected to open to traffic in 2022, serving as the northern terminus of NC 417. Work is also slated to begin in 2020 on a northward extension of NC 417 from this interchange as the Hampstead Bypass, concluding in 2025.\n\n"}

It closely resembles the sport of curling, a Scottish sport.\n\nThe game has its origins in western Flanders, Belgium where it is known as 'Trabollen'\n\nThe balls are rolled down a trough shaped dirt or synthetic alley towards a feather that sticks out at a spot located approximately six feet from each lane end. The object of the game is to get the ball as close to the feather as possible. Teams take turns rolling 12 balls (6 for each team) and may knock their opponent's balls out of the way, similar to Bocce. A coin flip determines which team rolls first. Typically, once this first team rolls two or three balls close to the feather, they roll the remainder of their balls so as to stop progressively shorter up the alley. This forces the team that rolls second to throw the balls in a manner that uses the curvature of the lane to weave around the \"blocks\", similar to a sine wave, in order to be able to get closer to the feather than the first team. The team with a ball or balls closest to the feather at the end of the round is awarded 1 point for each ball that is closer than the opponents nearest ball. In the United States, scoring points are not dependent on their location in relation to the feather, other than being closer than the opponent's balls. No extra points are awarded for landing on the feather, which is placed as a visual guide. The game is over when one team scores 10 points.\nThe last featherbowling championship was held in Marseille, France on September 17, 2015. There is a yearly championship awarded to the victor of the league at the Cadieux Cafe in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\n"}

It is a large, deciduous tree, growing well over tall, and can live more than 350 years. The tallest measured shagbark, located in Savage Gulf, Tennessee, is over tall. Mature shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark. This characteristic is, however, only found on mature trees; young specimens have smooth bark.\n\nThe shagbark hickory's nut is edible and has a very sweet taste.\n\nThe leaves are long, pinnate, with five (rarely three or seven) leaflets, the terminal three leaflets much larger than the basal pair. The shagbark hickory is monoecious. Staminate flowers are borne on long-stalked catkins at the tip of old wood or in the axils of the previous season's leaves. Pistillate flowers occur in short terminal spikes. The fruit is a drupe long, an edible nut with a hard, bony shell, contained in a thick, green four-sectioned husk which turns dark and splits off at maturity in the fall. The terminal buds on the shagbark hickory are large and covered with loose scales. Shagbark hickory nuts were a significant food source for the Algonquins. Red squirrels, gray squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, and mice are consumers of hickory nuts. Other consumers include black bears, gray and red foxes, rabbits, and bird species such as mallards, wood ducks, bobwhites, and wild turkey.\n\nThe two varieties are:\n\nSome sources regard southern shagbark hickory as the separate species \"Carya carolinae-septentrionalis\".\n\nThe word \"hickory\" is an aphetic form from earlier \"pohickory\", short for even earlier \"pokahickory\", borrowed from the Virginia Algonquian word \"pawcohiccora\", hickory-nut meat or a milky drink made from it. Other names for this tree are Carolina Hickory, Scalybark Hickory, Upland Hickory, and Shellbark Hickory, with older binomial names of Carya ovata var. fraxinifolia, Carya ovata var. nuttallii, Carya ovata var. pubescens, Hicoria alba, Hicoria borealis, and Hicoria ovata.\n\nShagbark hickory is found throughout most of the eastern United States, but it is largely absent from the southeastern and Gulf coastal plains and lower Mississippi Delta areas. An isolated population grows in eastern Canada as far north as Lavant Township, Canadian zone 4b. Scattered locations of shagbark hickory occur in the mountains of eastern Mexico.\n\nThe nuts are edible with an excellent flavor, and are a popular food among people and squirrels alike. They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the pecan in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n\"C. ovata\" begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\nAndrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood. In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at The Hermitage, his plantation in Tennessee. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandaceae species have large taproots) and nut litter.\n\nHickory nuts were a food source for Native Americans, who used the kernel milk to make corn cakes and hominy.\n\nShagbark hickory wood is used for smoking meat and for making the bows of Native Americans of the northern area. The lumber is heavy, hard, and tough, weighing 63 lb/ cu ft when air-dried, and has been employed for implements and tools that require strength. These include axles, axe handles, ploughs, skis, and drum sticks.\n\nThe bark of the shagbark hickory is also used to flavor a maple-style syrup.\n\nShagbark hickory hybridizes with pecan, \"Carya illinoensis\", and shellbark hickory, \"C. laciniosa\" (\"C. \"x\" dunbarii\" Sarg.). Shagbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the \"Carya\" species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, bitternut, shellbark, and shagbark) have been described, though most are unproductive or have other flaws. A few hican varieties are commercially propagated.\n\n"}

The total length is . At first, I-540 was a short spur connecting Fort Smith and Van Buren to I-40 as one of the original five Arkansas Interstates. The route ran just over to US 271 near the Oklahoma state line. The growing Northwest Arkansas area and the University of Arkansas needed an Interstate connection to Little Rock, and through traffic north to Kansas City had also outgrown the winding US 71 north from I-40. The route was extended north to Mountainburg in the late 1990s on an all-new alignment (going under concurrency with I-40, one of the only auxiliary routes with a concurrency with its parent) with the route being completed to Bella Vista in January 1999. However, the segment north of I-40 became a part of Interstate 49 in 2014.\n\nThe older portion of I-540, completed in the 1970s, connects Interstate 40 southwards to the Oklahoma state line, going through Van Buren and Fort Smith. This particular spur starts at Exit 7 on Interstate 40 (being 7 miles (11 km) east of the state line with Oklahoma). That point marks mile zero on this spur, in keeping with Interstate Highway rules that spur mileage begins at the \"parent\" route. The first 3 miles (5 km) are through Van Buren, before the bridge over the Arkansas River. The remainder, for a grand total of approximately , travels through Fort Smith. AHTD bid a $79 million project in 2013 for I-540 rehabilitation in Fort Smith that includes re-signing the route and renumbering the exits.\n\nBeginning at the I-540 and I-40 junction in Van Buren, the route begins southward along the eastern boundary of Van Buren, with exits numbered sequentially heading south. The segment is largely concurrent with US 71. The first exit along this segment of I-540/US 71 is with US 64 and US 71B (US 71B), which leads west into the Van Buren Historic District and east to Alma. Continuing south, I-540/US 71 passes over Highway 162 (Kibler Road), with no access between the routes. An exit providing access to Highway 59, via Riggs Drive (southbound) or Twin Circle Drive (northbound), is just prior crossing the Arkansas River. After crossing the river, the highways enter Fort Smith and Sebastian County. I-540/US 71 run through a commercial area and has three exits with city collector roads before an exit for Phoenix Avenue, which gives access to Fort Smith Regional Airport. However, this exit does not have any access to southbound I-540/US 71.\n\nNow turning toward the southwest, I-540/US 71 have exits with Highway 45 (Greenwood Road) and Highway 255 (Zero Street). Following these intersections, US 71 departs I-540 southbound toward Texarkana, with US 71B terminating at the parent route at the exit. I-540 begins to pass through a residential area before its final exit at US 271 and Highway 253. Following this exit, the roadway continues but ceases to be I-540, becoming US 271 and entering Oklahoma.\n\nThe Interstate spur opened in phases. According to a 1970 road map of Fort Smith, exits 2-11 (Van Buren through the Zero Street exit) were opened, with later exits (12-14) and the roadway itself still under construction. Portions of the roadway that became I-540 around Fayetteville were built in the early 1970s, but upgraded and extended in the mid-1990s. The highway around Fayetteville originally received US 71 signage until the complete I-540 spur was opened.\n\nOriginally, I-540 running from I-40 to Oklahoma through Fort Smith was originally signed east–west, but with the construction of the spur that ran north through Northwest Arkansas to Bella Vista the entire I-540 was resigned as a north–south road. It is one of the few that have changed this way.\n\nIn the late 1990s, I-540 was extended into Northwest Arkansas. It had been planned since the 1970s as a bypass of U.S. Highway 71. The first section, between Alma and Mountainburg was known as Arkansas Highway 540. Originally, the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) asked the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), who are in charge of Interstate and U.S. Highway route numbering, to allow the Interstate segment between Fort Smith and Bentonville to be named I-49, in order to emphasize plans to extend the route from Shreveport, Louisiana, through Arkansas to Kansas City, Missouri. AASHTO refused and the route opened on January 8, 1999, as a northern extension of I-540. On October 18, 2013, AASHTO approved AHTD's application to designate I-49 across the state, specifically allowing the state to renumber I-540 as I-49. The northern section of I-540 was renumbered I-49 in April 2014.\n\nHighway 540 (AR 540, Ark. 540, and Hwy. 540) was a temporary designation for what would later become Interstate 540 between Alma and Mountainburg in the U.S. state of Arkansas. Traveling a distance of approximately 12 miles, its southern terminus was at I-40 west of Alma and its northern terminus at US 71 in Mountainburg.\n"}

When complete, the route will completely encircle the city, meeting its parent route of Interstate 40 in one location.\n\nThe initial phase of construction is designated Interstate 540, and was completed in January 2007. It runs from Interstate 40 near the RDU Airport to I-87/US 64/US 264 south of Knightdale. The original plan was for the entire route to be designated as part of the Interstate Highway System, possibly renumbering the route to I-640 when the beltway was complete. When it became financially unfeasible to construct the entire route with public funds, it was decided that the remaining portion of the route (approximately 2/3 of the total completed mileage) would be constructed as a toll road and designated as a NC State Route rather than an Interstate Route. The first section of NC 540 was opened in July 2007 extending westward from the western terminus of I-540. Further extensions have carried NC 540 around the western side of Wake County to its current southwestern terminus south of Apex. Future projects are planned to complete the southern leg from Apex to Garner and eastern leg, from Garner to Knightdale, under the same toll system. In particular, the portion south of Garner has been held up due to conflicting interests in choosing a path for the route. No clear timetable exists for completion of these two legs.\n\nWhen completed, the beltway will total in length, surrounding the city of Raleigh and the towns of Apex, Cary, Garner, and Morrisville. The designation from I-540 and NC 540 happens at I-40, in Durham County, where I-540 goes east and NC 540 goes west.\n\nThe beltway is further broken down into four segments:\nI-540 is the designation for the northern part of the perimeter loop around Raleigh (not to be confused with the I-440 Beltline). Interstate 540 begins at Interstate 40 near the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Interstate 540 continues northeast until it reaches Aviation Parkway. Interstate 540 has an interchange with Aviation Parkway and continues along the south side of the Brier Creek neighborhood. About a mile after Aviation Parkway I-540 has an interchange with Lumley Road before having another interchange with US 70. After the US 70 interchange the freeway turns a more easterly direction. Interstate 540 has another interchange with Leesville Road, about 3 miles from the US 70 interchange and then continues toward North Raleigh. As Interstate 540 curves around to its northernmost point it starts to parallel Strickland Road, which is further to the south. The road heads north of Wildwood Green Golf Course and then has interchange with NC 50. Further east I-540 has an interchange with Six Forks Road and then Falls of Neuse Road. After Falls of Neuse Road I-540 starts to turn a more southeastern direction. As it approaches US 1 (Capital Boulevard) I-540 crosses a railroad track owned by CSX on an elevated bridge. Interstate 540 has a somewhat combined interchange between US 1 (exit 16) and Triangle Town Boulevard (exit 17). As I-540 continues east it has an interchange with US 401 (Louisburg Road). Interstate 540 continues just south of the Wake Tech campus. I-540 crosses the Neuse River and then turns south towards Knightdale. I-540 immediately has an interchange with Buffaloe Road (exit 20). I-540 continues south paralleling both the Neuse River and Forestville Road. As I-540 enters Knightdale it has an interchange with US 64 Business. About after the US 64 Business interchange Interstate 540 has its western terminus at Interstate 87/US 64/US 264.\n\nNC 540 is the designation given to the Western Wake Freeway and future Southern and Eastern Wake Freeways. As of January 2013, the North Carolina state route traverses east–west from I-40, in Durham County to NC 55, in Holly Springs. Initially intended to be signed as an extension of the I-540 loop, the first section of the route bears mile markers and exit numbers for the complete Interstate loop, going from 66 to 69. In mid-2012, this section of the beltway became part of the Triangle Expressway.\n\nNo portion of I-540 is tolled. All of NC 540 is tolled except the short segment between I-40 and NC 54. Tolls are implemented by electronic toll collection (ETC) and are enforced by video cameras. Several gantries are located along the route and entrance/exit ramps, where they collect toll via the NC Quick Pass or other interoperable ETC systems. Those that do not participate in the ETC program will receive a bill in the mail and will have 30 days from date on bill before additional fees and civil penalties are applied.\n\nPlanning for the highway originally started in the early 1970s; by 1976, the \"Northern Wake Expressway\" was added to the planning map. In the mid-1980s, realizing that the growth in western Wake County may require more roads than planned, highway planners decided to expand the project as a new beltway around Raleigh. In 1992, construction began on the first section of the Northern Wake Expressway, connecting I-40 with US 70. On January 21, 1997, the freeway opened as Interstate 540.\n\nIn the following ten years, the now known Northern Wake Freeway (so not to be confused with the Triangle Expressway) made several extensions:\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, each additional section of the freeway was designated as Future 540, until it connected with US 1.\n\nOn July 14, 2007, a section of the loop from I-40 west to NC 54 and NC 55 was opened. However, the route is signed not as I-540 but as NC 540. Officials decided to change the designation in early July at the urging of the North Carolina Turnpike Authority (NCTA). Work on the western and southern portions of the beltway, if paid for by state funds, would possibly not open until 2030. At the request of several Wake County mayors, the NCTA in 2006 began studying the use of tolls to complete these portions of the Outer Loop.\n\nThe Authority concluded in early 2007 that it would be financially feasible to build the western section (along with an extended Durham Freeway, which combined would be called the \"Triangle Expressway\") using toll funds. The NCTA apparently never wanted an interstate designation for the Western Wake Parkway. To lessen motorist confusion about where I-540 ended, the route was truncated to the I-40 interchange. All I-540 signs that were put up along the unopened stretch between I-40 and NC 55 were taken down in early July 2007; the new section is now signed as NC 540. (In addition, I-540 as a completed loop would violate the Interstate numbering convention regarding three-digit routes, as spurs begin with an odd number and loops with an even number, and at one point, I-640 — the last remaining available number within the state, as I-240, I-440 and I-840 are already taken — was proposed for the loop.)\n\nWork to build the Western Wake Freeway, which would be renamed the \"Western Wake Parkway\" under the toll proposal, began August 12, 2009, with the Triangle Parkway portion opening in December 2011, and Western Wake portion scheduled to open in two phases in 2012.\n\nIn October 2008, the authority was unable to issue bonds to fund the Western Wake Turnpike project as planned due to market conditions affecting municipal bonds such as those. On July 29, 2009, the Authority closed on a revised $1.01 billion bond plan, consisting of $270 million in toll revenue bonds, $353 million in Build America Bonds, and a $387 million loan from the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act.\n\nGroundbreaking was held on August 12, 2009 at the west end of Interstate 540. \"A dozen dignitaries\" used shovels painted gold as 150 watched.\n\nAfter work began on Western Wake Parkway in 2009, engineering and environmental studies began a year later for the Southern and Eastern Wake Freeways, also known as the Triangle Expressway Southeast Extension. Construction would begin in 2014 and be completed by 2019; however, it was delayed in March 2011 by the enactment of North Carolina Session Law 2011-7 (N.C. S.L. 2011-7), which forbid NCDOT to consider a few alternative routes.\n\nIn 2010, NCDOT made an interchange improvement at I-540/I-40; adding another auxiliary lane from I-540 south to I-40 west, at a cost of $4.8 million.\n\nThe completed Triangle Parkway, the first section of the Triangle Expressway, with its connection to NC 540, opened on December 8, 2011, reestablishing exit 67. Collection of tolls began on January 3, 2012. On August 1, 2012, the first phase of the Western Wake Freeway opened, connecting NC 55 in Morrisville (exit 66) to US 64 in Apex. The next day tolling began on the previously open section from NC 54 to NC 55. The final phase of the tolled section of NC 540, from US 64 to NC 55 north of Holly Springs opened on December 20, 2012. Tolling for this section began January 2, 2013. On April 3, 2017, the Veridea Parkway interchange (exit 55; formally known as Old Holly Springs Apex Road) was opened to traffic; at a cost of $20 million, it was constructed by Blythe Construction and Kimley-Horn. An interchange with the newly extended Morrisville Parkway (exit 64) opened to traffic on February 3, 2020.\n\nA plan approved by the Raleigh city council in November 2013 includes asking for tolls for the existing highway in order to widen it to eight lanes by 2035 or 2040. This would require both state and federal approval. As a temporary solution to increased traffic on the northern section, NCDOT has installed ramp meters on some on-ramps, the first ones in the state.\n\nThe Southern Wake Expressway would connect Holly Springs with Garner. The route for the southern leg known as the Orange Route, has been protected from development by NCDOT since the 1990s, but it would cross habitat for the endangered dwarf wedge mussel. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asked for routes north of the Orange Route to be considered as a way to provide a shorter option, possibly minimizing impacts to natural resources. In September 2010, a new map showed several other routes, including the controversial Red Route, which many Garner-area residents protested in a December 2010 meeting; a total of 3,000 signatures on petitions opposed the route as well.\n\nAfter two years, the General Assembly chose to permit studying the Red Corridor, which meant possible routes could once again be considered. Documents released September 9, 2013 changed the 30-mile project from two phases to a single project, with construction expected to begin in 2018 and be completed by 2022. Public meetings were scheduled in October 2013 for \"Complete 540\".\n\nIn April 2016, the NCDOT announced that Detailed Study Alternative 2 was selected as the preferred alternative for the project. The route goes from west to east and combines the proposed orange, green (southern portion), mint and green (northern portion) corridor segments.\n\n"}

It was written by all four members of the band for their third studio album, \"X&Y\" (2005). The track is built around an organ accompanied by piano and guitar in the first half and an alternative rock style in the second half featuring electric guitar, bass and drums.\n\nIt was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from \"X&Y\" and reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States \"Billboard\" Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US.\n\n\"Fix You\" was critically acclaimed by music critics. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens' home games, during the three stars of the game selection after every Los Angeles Kings home win, and was played at Staples Center as the Stanley Cup was brought on the ice after the Kings' victory in the 2014 Stanley Cup Final. The song is also used for the 2015–16 New York Islanders inaugural season in Barclays Center. In 2013, the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir recorded a mashup cover version of the song, combining it with \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" by Simon & Garfunkel. This single, titled \"A Bridge over You\", claimed the coveted UK Christmas number one spot two years later, in 2015.\n\nThe song was played live at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, California and at One Love Manchester charity concert on 4 June 2017.\n\nWhen writing the song, lead singer Martin originally intended to use a church-style organ for the track. Unable to gain access to the instrument, Martin instead used an old keyboard that his late father-in-law, Bruce Paltrow, gave to his daughter Gwyneth. However, in other instances Martin has claimed that \"Fix You\" is influenced by English alternative rock band Elbow's 2003 anthem \"Grace Under Pressure\".\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song, Martin said: \"My father-in-law Bruce Paltrow bought this big keyboard just before he died. No one had ever plugged it in. I plugged it in, and there was this incredible sound I'd never heard before. All these songs poured out from this one sound. Something has to inspire you, and something else takes over. It's very cloudy.\" Martin also noted that the song is \"probably the most important song we've ever written\".\n\nDuring a track-by-track analysis bassist Guy Berryman admitted that the song takes \"a bit of inspiration\" from Jimmy Cliff's 1969 song \"Many Rivers to Cross\". Berryman also added, \"It becomes its own thing, kind of like points of inspiration that kind of lead you down certain paths. Whenever you want to write a song like someone else, it ultimately ends up sounding like something different anyway.\"\n\nThe song features an organ and piano in the key of E major. It begins as a hushed electric organ ballad, with Martin's falsetto. The song then builds in acoustic guitar and piano, accompanied by a string section during the beginning choruses. The melody shifts to a plaintive three-note guitar line, ringing through a rhythmic upbeat drum tempo. The song transitions to its bridge, which roars into a blend of piano notes, electric & bass guitar riffs, drums, and a singalong chorus with an anthemic feel. A synthesiser joins the music during the second half of the bridge. The song ends with the beginning chorus, with slow, melancholic piano notes being played in the background.\n\nThe message that Martin sings throughout, is of encouragement: \"Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones / And I will try to fix you.\" Michele Hatty of \"USA Weekend\" reported that Martin sings about recovering from grief in the song. Travis Gass of the \"Bangor Daily News\" wrote that Martin offers his sympathies for the downtrodden, with \"When you love someone but it goes to waste / Could it be worse?\".\n\nColdplay released \"Fix You\" in the UK and US on 5 September 2005 as the second single of their third album. The single was pressed with two B-sides: \"The World Turned Upside Down\" and \"Pour Me\". On 14 September 2005, the band released the \"Fix You EP\" in the iTunes Store. In response to Hurricane Katrina, all of the sales went to the American Red Cross Hurricane 2005 Relief and the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences' MusiCares Hurricane Relief Fund. Promotional singles were released in the UK and US.\n\nThe track peaked at number four in the UK Singles Chart on 17 September 2005. As of 30 July 2011, the song had spent 122 weeks on that chart.\nIt peaked at number 59 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 18 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The song also charted on the \"Billboard\" Pop 100 and Hot Digital Songs. The single appeared in Australia's Singles Chart in the number four position on 18 September 2005, after retiring in the 58 spot. It also appeared at number eight on the Irish Singles Chart and spent seven consecutive weeks on the chart. On 14 November 2010, the song re-entered the Australian singles chart at number 37.\n\nIn 2005, Coldplay performed the song live on \"Saturday Night Live\" and the Live 8 event in July. It has also become the anthem for the event.\n\nIn 2009, the song also appeared on Coldplay's live album, \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\".\n\nOn 19 October 2011, the band played the song at the \"Celebrating Steve\" event for Apple employees over a global media stream to all the Apple Stores. This event was also available for Apple customers via the company website. On 4 June 2017, Coldplay performed \"Fix You\" at the \"One Love Manchester\" benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.\n\nThe song received widespread acclaim from music critics. In the \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" review of the album, critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote: \"One of the best is 'Fix You', an unabashedly sentimental song where Martin delivers words of encouragement in a gentle falsetto [...] Proving once more that no band can deliver a stately rock ballad like this one.\" Paul McNamee of \"NME\" magazine wrote: \"It’s a wonderful song that shifts from simple stark piano and voice to a ringing, clattering burst of intent and proto-prog four-part harmony.\" Adrien Begrand of PopMatters in his review of the album, noted the song as the \"best ballad\" off \"X&Y\". In 2005, the song appeared at number two on \"Q\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Tracks of the Year\", and was listed as one of the \"Tracks of the Year\" by \"NME\" in 2005.\n\nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band's first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete.\n\nIn the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of \"X&Y\". The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King's Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin's walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song's finale. The audience sings along with the song's final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\n\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.\n\nThe song appears in \"The Acoustic Album\" (2006). It was performed in 2006 by the New England octogenarian chorus group Young@Heart. The group's performance was led by former chorus member Fred Knittle, who suffered from congestive heart failure and breathed with assistance from an oxygen tank. The performance was originally planned to be a duet between Knittle and Bob Salvini, another former chorus member, but Salvini died shortly before the show. Knittle performed it as a solo, as a tribute to his friend. The performance was initially recorded for a British documentary that aired on Channel 4; footage of the performance was uploaded to YouTube in November 2006 to positive response. An expanded version of the film, titled \"Young@Heart\", debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in US theatres in 2008.\n\n\nThe song was featured in an episode of the American teen drama television series \"The O.C.\", and then in \"Without a Trace\", \"Cold Case\" and \"Brothers & Sisters\". The half part of the song was played over the trailer for the 2006 film \"World Trade Center\". It was also featured in the 2006 movie \"You, Me and Dupree\". The track was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award in the category of Best Song musically and lyrically. The song was also nominated for a UK Festival Award in the category of Anthem of the Summer. On 14 March 2009, the band performed a rendition of the song at the relief concert, Sound Relief, in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe song has been used on the final sequences of the episode \"I'll Try to Fix You\" of the 2012 HBO's television series \"The Newsroom\", as well as an episode of \"Scrubs\", and the final scene of the episode \"Cargo\" of the CBS series \"Cold Case\". The song also briefly featured in the Australian family drama \"Packed to the Rafters\". In 2013, \"Fix You\" was used in the final episode of the first season of British public television Channel 4's comedy-drama \"Derek\". \"Fix You\" was played during an episode of Brothers & Sisters.\n\nOn an episode of the BBC comedy game show \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", the Coldplay song \"Violet Hill\" was used in a segment, and when regular panellist Noel Fielding said that he \"genuinely hated Coldplay,\" host David Tennant then played a snippet of \"Fix You\" and mouthed the line \"\"And I will try...to fix you.\"\" Comedian Catherine Tate also finished the lyrics of the chorus correctly in a different segment of the same episode.\nThe song was also played at the wedding of the Swedish prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist on 13 June 2015, performed by Salem al Fakir.\n\nAmerican ice dance team Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani used the song for their free dance in the 2015-2016 season.\n\nThe song also appeared in the Season Two episode, \"Unfinished Business\", of CBS medical drama Code Black and opening montage for the NHL Centennial Classic on Sportsnet. The song is also used in the introduction of the 2017 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs game, featuring the Nashville Predators and Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nAn arrangement of the song was performed live during the Top 11 elimination episode of the reality television singing competition program \"The Voice\" by Team Gwen (Stefani) members Brennley Brown and Hunter Plake, along with their coach, Stefani, herself, with the episode in question airing on 2 May 2017.\n\nIn the movie \"Yesterday,\" a character says that the Beatles song \"Yesterday\" isn't quite as good as Coldplay's \"Fix You.\"\n\nThe song was also featured in the 2019 Dreamworks film Abominable, in which Yi plays the song on her violin as she guides the Yeti home.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865502", "title": "Wrongfully Accused", "text": "Wrongfully Accused\n\nWrongfully Accused is a 1998 German-American satirical comedy film written, produced and directed by Pat Proft and starring Leslie Nielsen as a man who has been framed for murder and desperately attempts to expose the true culprits. The film is a parody of the 1993 film \"The Fugitive\" and the 1995 film \"The Usual Suspects\".\n\nWorld-famous violinist Ryan Harrison (Leslie Nielsen, who had guest starred in two early episodes of \"The Fugitive\" television series in the 1960s) is seen giving a concert. Afterwards, he goes to a party where he meets Hibbing Goodhue (Michael York), a millionaire who sponsors Harrison's performances, as well as Goodhue's seductive wife Lauren (Kelly Le Brock) and his possible mistress Cass Lake (Melinda McGraw).\n\nThe next evening, he finds a note from Lauren in his car which summons him to the Goodhue residence. When he goes to the Goodhue mansion, he bumps into Sean Laughrea (Aaron Pearl), who has just killed Goodhue (together with an unknown accomplice). A violent fight follows, during which Harrison discovers that Sean is missing an eye, an arm, and a leg, and he overhears the preparations for an operation with the codename \"Hylander\" before he is knocked out. When he wakes up, Harrison finds himself arrested and convicted for the murder of Goodhue. Desperate to prove his innocence, Harrison escapes from his prison transport following an accident. Lieutenant Fergus Falls (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene, takes charge, barks out orders and vows to do whatever it takes to capture the fugitive.\n\nHarrison returns to the Goodhue mansion where he encounters Cass, who is trying to retrieve something from behind a portrait. She tells him she knows he is innocent and believes Lauren is the killer, but refuses to say anything to the police because Lauren is her sister. She provides him with a place to hide and helps him shake his pursuers, but Harrison's opportunities to rest are short and fleeting: Falls seems to find him wherever he goes, and Cass behaves suspiciously, increasing Harrison's doubts of whom to trust.\n\nHarrison gradually begins to piece together the puzzle; he remembers that Sean was present at the party as the bartender and was given a great amount of money by Cass. He also finds that Cass is strangely interested in Sir Robert McKintyre, the secretary-general of the United Nations. Eventually, after investigating Sean's disabilities in a limb replacement clinic, he discovers that Cass, Lauren and Sean are planning an assassination attempt on McKintyre. He manages to follow the group but is caught. Cass shoots Harrison but actually fakes his death, both because she has fallen in love with him and because she wants to stop the assassination, since she has found out that McKintyre is really her father. Goodhue has been murdered by Sean and Lauren because he had come to suspect that his wife was actually a terrorist and had only used him to further her goals.\n\nAt a Scottish festival, Harrison and Cass just barely manage to save McKintyre's life. They are cornered by Lauren, Sean and accomplices, but Fergus Falls and a SWAT team arrive just in the nick of time, arresting the terrorists. Falls officially tells Harrison that he was \"wrongfully accused\", clearing his name and acquitting him. In the last scene, Harrison and Cass are riding on the bow of a cruise ship (spoofing \"Titanic\") and end up bumping their heads on a low bridge.\n\n\n\"Wrongfully Accused\" was released in Germany on July 23, 1998.\n\nThe film opened on August 21, 1998 in 2,062 cinemas. On its opening weekend, it grossed USD $3,504,630 or approximately $1,700 per theatre. \"Wrongfully Accused\"s overall gross was $9,642,860.\n\n\"Wrongfully Accused\" received generally negative reviews. It received a 22% \"rotten\" rating on the Rotten Tomatoes web site based on 32 reviews and a 3.9/10 rating. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJames Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film only one out of four stars and wrote: \"\"Wrongfully Accused\" is a mind-numbingly awful motion picture that has a better chance of making a viewer physically ill than of provoking a genuine laugh. Someone should sit down with Leslie Nielsen and suggest that, for his own good and the good of all those who go to his movies, he should retire. ... Nielsen may be a nice guy, but his increasingly feeble attempts at \"comic\" performances are becoming so painful to watch that I'm starting to dislike the man. ... \"Wrongfully Accused\" has nothing worth laughing at. With as many lame one-liners, visual gags, and puns as this script lobs at the audience, it comes as an absolute shock how humorless the results are. ... It's incomprehensible to think that anyone would find this movie funny—except the quote whores, that is.\"\n\nAnita Gates of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"No one can accuse \"Wrongfully Accused\" of a shortage of jokes. ... Unfortunately, most of the jokes just aren't very funny. ... Maybe Pat Proft [...] works best as part of a team. Maybe he needs one of his old collaborators -- ideally David Zucker or Jim Abrahams -- to turn his concepts into punch lines. Without them, \"Wrongfully Accused\" [...] feels like a tangle of funny ideas all dressed up with nowhere to go. ... Throughout the film, Richard Crenna [...] seems right on the verge of making his Tommy Lee Jones imitation truly great, but he always just misses, maybe because he has only his attitude to work with. ... Even a cameo by the generally fabulous Sandra Bernhard falls flat. Things go better for Lamb Chop, the saccharine little sock puppet whose creator, Shari Lewis, died earlier this month.

It is an important concept in Buddhist praxis (\"Patipatti\"). The word \"bhavana\" normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as \"citta-bhavana\" (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or \"metta-bhavana\" (the development/cultivation of lovingkindness). When used on its own, \"bhavana\" signifies contemplation and 'spiritual cultivation' generally.\n\n\"Bhavana\" derives from the word \"Bhava\" meaning \"becoming\" or the subjective process of arousing mental states.\n\nTo explain the cultural context of the historical Buddha's employment of the term, Glenn Wallis emphasizes \"bhavana\"s sense of cultivation. He writes that a farmer performs \"bhavana\" when he or she prepares soil and plants a seed. Wallis infers the Buddha's intention with this term by emphasizing the terrain and focus on farming in northern India at the time in the following passage:\nIn the Pali Canon \"bhāvanā\" is often found in a compound phrase indicating personal, intentional effort over time with respect to the development of that particular faculty. For instance, in the Pali Canon and post-canonical literature one can find the following compounds:\n\nIn addition, in the Canon, the development (\"bhāvanā\") of \"samatha-vipassana\" is lauded. Subsequently, Theravada teachers have made use of the following compounds:\n\nThe word \"bhavana\" is sometimes translated into English as 'meditation' so that, for example, \"metta-bhavana\" may be translated as 'the meditation on loving-kindness'. Meditation is properly called \"dhyana\" (Sanskrit; Pali: \"jhāna\"), as practiced in \"samādhi\", the 8th limb of the eightfold path.\n\nIn Jainism, \"bhāvana\" refers to \"right conception or notion\" or \"the moral of a fable\".\n\n\n"}

Yale-Lillooet was last contested in the 2005 General Election; in 2009 it was largely replaced by Fraser-Nicola, with the Fraser Canyon portions in the southwest transferred to Chilliwack-Hope and the town of Keremeos in the extreme southeast transferred to Boundary-Similkameen.\n\nThe riding was largely rural and wilderness in character despite its proximity to the Lower Mainland, it spanned the Bridge River-Lillooet, Ashcroft-Thompson Canyon, Fraser Canyon, Nicola and Similkameen Districts.\n\nSince creation its shape remained relatively unchanged despite some minor boundary adjustments, with (e.g.) Ashcroft-Cache Creek joining Cariboo South in some elections and the Similkameen area joined to one of the Okanagan ridings.

It is the most decorated regiment of the Indian Army and in 1979, the 1st battalion was the Commonwealth's most decorated battalion with 245 pre-independence and 82 post-independence gallantry awards, when it was transformed into the 4th battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment. The first battalion of the regiment was officially raised just before the annexation of the Sikh Empire on August 1 1846, by the British East India Company. Currently, the Sikh Regimental Centre is located in Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand. The Centre was earlier located in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe modern Sikh Regiment traces its roots directly from the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian Army like its sister regiments, the numeral prefix (in the case of the Sikh Regiment, 11) was removed and extra battalions were raised, transferred or disbanded to meet army needs. With a humble beginning of two battalions, today the fraternity has grown to a regiment of 19 regular infantry and two reserve battalions strong.\n\nAfter the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-1846), Sikhs who lived in the territory ruled by the Sikh Empire (the Punjab region) began to be recruited into the Bengal Army of the British East India Company. Among the earliest entirely Sikh units of the Bengal Army were the Regiment of Ferozepore (raised in 1846) which later became the 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs, and the Regiment of Ludhiana (also raised in 1846) which later became the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs. After the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-1849) more Punjabis began to be recruited into the Bengal Army, forming regiments such as the 1st Bengal Military Police Battalion, which later became the 45th Rattray's Sikhs. Sikh units generally remained loyal to the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in which many regiments of the Bengal Army (which mainly recruited from Bihar and Awadh) mutinied against their British officers. After the rebellion, troops from Bihar and Awadh were recruited less as they had led the mutiny; the centre of recruitment then shifted to the Punjab and the North-West Frontier, resulting in more Sikhs being recruited into the Bengal Army. A number of new Sikh regiments were raised, such as the 36th Sikhs and 35th Sikhs, both raised in 1887. 21 soldiers of the 36th Sikhs fought in the Battle of Saragarhi against 6,000-10,000 Pashtun tribesmen in 1897 during campaigns in the North-West Frontier, in what is considered by some military historians as one of history's greatest last stands. In 1922 the Indian government reformed the British Indian Army by amalgamating single battalion regiments into multi-battalion regiments; this led to the formation of the 11th Sikh Regiment from the 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs, the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs, the 45th Rattray's Sikhs, the 36th Sikhs, the 47th Sikhs, and the 35th Sikhs. The 11th Sikh Regiment served during World War II and on the partition of India, the regiment was allotted to the newly formed Indian Army, becoming the Sikh Regiment.\n\nAs part of the British Indian Army, Sikh regiments fought in numerous wars all over the world, such as the Second Opium War in China, the Second Anglo-Afghan War, many campaigns on the North-West Frontier, the Western Front, Gallipoli and Mesopotamia campaigns of the First World War, the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and the North African, Italian and Burma campaigns of the Second World War, earning many gallantry awards and battle honours in the process.\n\nDuring the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948, the 1st battalion of the Sikh Regiment was the first unit to be airlifted to Srinagar to aid in the defence of the Kashmir Valley against Pakistani irregular forces. Battalions of the Sikh Regiment also fought in the Sino-Indian War in 1962, the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1965 and 1971, and the Kargil War in 1999.\n\nEnlisted soldiers are recruited mainly from the Sikh landowning castes of Punjab and its surrounding states. They trained in the Sikh Regimental Centre, currently located in Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand. The war cry of the regiment, taken from Sikh scriptures, is \"Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal\". \n\n\nOthers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 5000 Indian soldiers, some belonging to the regiment, mutinied after the storming of the Golden Temple by the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star in 1984. The Sikh Regiment's 9th battalion was disbanded after a large number of its troops mutinied.\n\nAdvanced plans by the British Army to raise a Sikh infantry regiment that would recruit from the UK's Sikh community were scrapped due to accusations by the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) that such a creation could be viewed as racist or sectarian. The plan had many supporters, including Prince Charles.\n\nThe museum of the Sikh Regimental Centre displays a record of the Sikh Regiment in four halls viz., \n\nIn all, the regiment has to its credit 1652 gallantry awards and honours including:\n\nIn addition it has also earned:\n\n21 soldiers of the 36th Sikhs were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit for their actions in the Battle of Saragarhi in 1897:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService = IAF\n\nService =IAF\nService = IAF\nService = Indian Army\nService = Indian Army\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While practicing bankruptcy law during the early 1930s, he negotiated a business deal for a vaudeville performer Ted Lewis, and realized the income potential for acting as an agent.\n\nLazar moved to Hollywood in 1936 but maintained a presence in New York until after World War II when he moved to Los Angeles permanently. After putting together three major deals for Humphrey Bogart in a single day, he was dubbed \"Swifty\" by Bogart, a nickname he disliked.\n\nIn addition to Bogart, Lazar became the agent representing other celebrities, including Lauren Bacall, Truman Capote, Cher, Joan Collins, Noël Coward, Ira Gershwin, Cary Grant, Moss Hart, Ernest Hemingway, Gene Kelly, Madonna, Walter Matthau, Larry McMurtry, Vladimir Nabokov, Clifford Odets, Cole Porter, William Saroyan, Irwin Shaw, President Richard Nixon and Tennessee Williams. Lazar's power became such that he could negotiate a deal for someone who was not even his client and then collect a fee from that person's agent. Oscar Levant said of Lazar, \"Everybody who matters has two agents: his own and Irving Lazar.\" \n\nDuring World War II, Lazar, with Benjamin Landis, suggested to the U.S. Army Air Forces that it produce a play to encourage enlistment and to raise funds for the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The Air Forces commanding general, Henry H. Arnold, agreed and the play \"Winged Victory\" was written by Moss Hart and produced by Hart and Lazar. It was a huge success, playing on Broadway and on tour around the U.S. for over a million people. A film version was produced during the same period.\n\nDuring the 1950s Lazar expanded from Hollywood deal-making to doing book publishing deals.\n\nLazar was an executive producer (with Bernie Brillstein) of John G. Avildsen's \"Neighbors\" (1981), starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, and he was an associate producer on two television miniseries, \"The Thorn Birds\" (1983) and \"Robert Kennedy & His Times\" (1985).\n\nSimon & Schuster editor-in-chief Michael Korda wrote a 1993 \"New Yorker\" profile of Lazar, later incorporated into Korda's book, \"Another Life: A Memoir of Other People\" (Random House, 1999). Korda gave this description of his first view of Lazar, \"The person in question was standing on the other side of the pool, an incongruous, diminutive figure among all the half-naked, oiled, and bronzed bodies. He was totally bald, and his face--what could be seen of it below huge, glittering gold-rimmed Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses--was tanned, like his pate, to the color of a well-cared-for crocodile handbag. He was wearing tiny white shoes, a blue blazer with gold buttons, and white trousers pressed so perfectly, despite the heat, that he looked like a shiny, expensive beach toy that had just been unpacked by some lucky child. He was shouting into a telephone.\"\n\nLazar died in 1993, aged 86, from complications stemming from diabetes, which had cut off circulation to his feet. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Lazar, who was being treated at home via peritoneal dialysis, refused. This refusal hastened Lazar's death. He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles next to his wife, Mary Van Nuys, who had died in January that same year from liver cancer.\n\nAt the time of his death, Lazar was working on his autobiography, \"Swifty: My Life and Good Times\", which was completed by Annette Tapert and published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.\n\nSwifty Lazar appears as a character in Peter Morgan's stage play \"Frost/Nixon\", first staged at the Donmar Warehouse, London on August 10, 2006 and played by actor Kerry Shale. In the play, Lazar negotiates a deal with David Frost on behalf of President Richard Nixon for Frost to interview Nixon. The play is closely based on real-life events. He was also portrayed by Toby Jones in the 2008 film version of \"Frost/Nixon\". Swifty Lazar also appeared, thinly disguised as Irving \"Sneaky\" LaSalle, in George Axelrod's 1956 take on Dr. Faustus, the play \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" where Sneaky as an agent, will get his clients absolutely anything they want for 10% of their soul. The Lazar role was played on Broadway by Martin Gable. Lazar was parodied on \"The Muppet Show\" as Fozzie Bear's agent, Irving Bizarre, who was so short that he appeared only as a top hat atop a pair of shoes.\n\n"}

Traditionally an aqsaqal was the leader of a village or aul until the Soviet times. Acting as advisors or judges, these elders have or had a role in politics and the justice system in countries and tribes. For instance, there are \"aksakals\" courts in Kyrgyzstan. In Uzbekistan, which has traditionally been a more urban society (the Uzbeks being \"sarts\" or town-dwellers, as opposed to nomadic Turks), cities are divided up into \"mahallas\". Each \"mahalla\" has an \"aqsaqal\" who acts as the district leader.\n\nIn 1995, then-President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev announced a decree to revitalize the \"aqsaqal\" courts. The courts would have jurisdiction over property, torts and family law. The \"aqsaqal\" courts were eventually included under Article 92 of the Kyrgyz constitution. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,000 \"aqsaqal\" courts throughout Kyrgyzstan, including in the capital of Bishkek. Akaev linked the development of these courts to the rekindling of Kyrgyz national identity. In a 2005 speech, he connected the courts back to the country's nomadic past and extolled how the courts expressed the Kyrgyz ability of self-governance.\n\n"}

There is a general belief that older vines, when properly handled, will give a better wine. There is no legal or generally agreed definition for \"old\".\n\nGrape vines can grow for over 120 years. After about 20 years vines start to produce smaller crops, and average yields decrease, leading to more concentrated, intense wines. Diseases such as \"dead arm\" can also afflict old vines, in some cases further concentrating the juice. \"Old vines\" might apply to an entire estate, or it might mean only a certain parcel planted before others. In the U.S., the most common use is on Zinfandel, because in California vineyards up to 125 years old are still bearing small amounts of prized Zinfandel fruit.\n\nIn a place where wine production is longstanding, it often means a wine whose vines are thirty to forty years old. Some wine makers insist the vines should be older than this. In newly established wine regions, twenty years might be old. The definition is further complicated by the fact that certain varieties simply do not have economically viable yields when they get truly ancient.\n\nThe oldest known grape-producing vine is a Žametovka vine growing in Maribor in Slovenia, which is known to have been alive in the 17th century; it produces a token of about 35 to 55 kg grapes each year, which is fermented and put into about 100 miniature bottles.\n\nIn the South Tyrol wine region of northeast Italy, a more-than 350-year-old vine of Versoaln planted at Castel Katzenzungen is being used to produce wine with the fruit of the old vine blended with the fruit of younger plantings to produce approximately 500 bottles a year.\n\nThe oldest vine with a fully authenticated minimum age, and thought to be the largest in the world, is known as the Great Vine at Hampton Court Palace in England. It was transplanted under the direction of Lancelot Capability Brown to its current site in 1769. The variety is ‘Shiva Grossa’ (also called Black Hamburg). Contrary to the normal expectation for old vines, it produced its largest crop ever in autumn of 2001, of 383 kilograms (845 lbs).\n\nIn the Barossa Valley, the world's oldest continually producing commercial vineyard that has been authenticated is believed to be the Shiraz vines at Turkey Flat in Tanunda that were originally planted in 1847. Block 42 at the Penfolds Kalimna Vineyard in the Barossa Valley contains Cabernet Sauvignon vines planted in 1888, believed to be the oldest Cabernet vineyard still producing wine. The Barossa Old Vine Charter was established to protect the older vines in the region and prevent them from being removed from the ground.\n\nBecause there is no objective definition, an \"old vines\" wine might or might not show any specific characteristics related to vine age. Generally, the more reputable the producer, the more likely it is to have veracity. Similarly, if a producer sells a \"regular\" and \"old vines\" bottling, it is more likely to represent a perceptible difference in character, if not necessarily in quality. In these ways, \"old vines\" is similar to \"reserve,\" a term that also varies dramatically in its significance and in many countries and regions has no legal definition.\n"}

The bridge is located within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area approximately southeast of Las Vegas, and carries Interstate 11 and U.S. Route 93 over the Colorado River. Opened in 2010, it was the key component of the Hoover Dam Bypass project, which rerouted US 93 from its previous routing along the top of Hoover Dam and removed several hairpin turns and blind curves from the route. It is jointly named for Mike O'Callaghan, Governor of Nevada from 1971–1979, and Pat Tillman, an American football player who left his career with the Arizona Cardinals to enlist in the United States Army and was killed in Afghanistan in 2004 by friendly fire.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, officials identified the US 93 route over Hoover Dam to be dangerous and inadequate for projected traffic volumes.

In March 2001, the Federal Highway Administration selected the route, which crosses the Colorado River approximately downstream of Hoover Dam. Construction of the bridge approaches began in 2003, and construction of the bridge itself began in February 2005. The bridge was completed in 2010 and the entire bypass route opened to vehicle traffic on October 19, 2010. The Hoover Dam Bypass project was completed within budget at a cost of $240 million; the bridge portion cost $114 million.\n\nThe bridge was the first concrete-steel composite arch bridge built in the United States, and incorporates the widest concrete arch in the Western Hemisphere. At above the Colorado River, it is the second highest bridge in the United States after the Royal Gorge Bridge near Cañon City, Colorado, and is the world's highest concrete arch bridge.\n\nIn 1935, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, later AASHTO) authorized a southward extension of U.S. Route 93 from its previous southern terminus in Glendale, Nevada to Kingman, Arizona by way of Las Vegas and Boulder City, crossing the Colorado River on the newly constructed Hoover Dam (also known then as Boulder Dam). Clark County was sparsely populated at the time, with a population of less than 9,000 at the 1930 U.S. Census (compared to an estimated 2 million in 2013). Development in and around Las Vegas in the latter half of the 20th century made Las Vegas and its surrounding area a tourist attraction, and US 93 became an important transportation corridor for passenger and commercial traffic between Las Vegas and Phoenix. In 1995, the portion of US 93 over Hoover Dam was included as part of the CANAMEX Corridor, a high-priority transportation corridor established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This bridge is a key component of the proposed Interstate 11 project.\n\nThrough traffic on US 93 combined with pedestrian and tourist traffic at Hoover Dam itself led to major traffic congestion on the dam and on the approaches to the dam. The approaches featured hairpin turns on both the Nevada and Arizona sides of the dam, and the terrain caused limited sight distances around curves. In addition to traffic safety considerations, officials were also concerned about the safety and security of Hoover Dam, specifically the impact a vehicle accident could have on the dam's operation and the waters of Lake Mead. Officials first discussed the need for a new Colorado River crossing that would bypass the dam in the 1960s. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam, began work on the \"Colorado River Bridge Project\" in 1989, but the project was put on hold in 1995. In 1997 the Federal Highway Administration took over the project and released a draft environmental impact statement in 1998. From 1998–2001 state officials from Arizona and Nevada as well as several federal government agencies studied the feasibility of several alternative routes and river crossings, as well as the feasibility of modifying the roadway over the dam, restricting traffic over the dam, or doing nothing.\n\nIn March 2001, the Federal Highway Administration issued a Record of Decision indicating its selection of the \"Sugarloaf Mountain Alternative\" routing. The project called for approximately of highway in Nevada, of highway in Arizona, and a bridge length of that would cross the river downstream (south) of Hoover Dam. Design work began in July 2001.\n\nSecurity measures implemented following the September 11 attacks prohibited commercial truck traffic from driving across Hoover Dam. Prior to the completion of the bridge, commercial vehicles were required to follow a detour between Boulder City and Kingman via US 95, Nevada State Route 163, the Colorado River crossing between Laughlin, Nevada and Bullhead City, Arizona, and Arizona State Route 68. The detour was long, but only added to the normal journey on US 93.\n\nProject design was by the Hoover Support team, led by HDR, Inc. and including T.Y. Lin International, Sverdrup Civil, Inc., and other specialist contributors.\n\nThe bridge has a length of and a span. The roadway is above the Colorado River and four lanes wide. This is the first concrete-and-steel composite arch bridge built in the United States. It includes the widest concrete arch in the Western Hemisphere and is also the second highest bridge in the nation, with the arch above the river. The twin arch ribs are connected by steel struts.\n\nThe composite design, using concrete for the arch and columns with steel construction for the roadway deck, was selected for schedule and cost control while being aesthetically compatible with the Hoover Dam. Sean Holstege in \"The Arizona Republic\" has called the bridge \"an American triumph\". \"USA Today\" called it \"America's Newest Wonder\" on October 18, 2010.\n\nPedestrian access is provided over the bridge to tourists who wish to take in a different view of the nearby dam and river below, but the dam is not visible for those driving across it. A parking area is provided near the bridge on the Nevada side at what was a staging area during construction. A set of stairs and disabled access ramps lead to the sidewalk across the bridge.\n\nWork began in 2003 on the approaches in both states and the construction contract for the arch bridge was awarded in October 2004. The largest obstacle to the project was the river crossing. The bridge and the bypass were constructed by a consortium of different government agencies and contractors, among them the Federal Highway Administration, the Arizona Department of Transportation, and Nevada Department of Transportation, with RE Monks Construction and Vastco, Inc, constructing the Arizona Approach, Edward Kraemer & Sons, Inc, the Nevada Approach and Las Vegas Paving Corporation undertaking the roadway surfacing on both approaches. The bridge itself was built by Obayashi Corporation and PSM Construction USA, Inc., while Frehner Construction Company, Inc. was responsible for completing the final roadway installations. A permit problem between Clark County and the subcontractor Casino Ready Mix arose in May 2006 over the operation of a concrete-batch plant for the project, and this caused a four-month delay.\n\nConstruction required hoisting workers and up to of materials above the Colorado River using -long steel cables held aloft by a \"high-line\" crane system. High winds caused a cableway failure in September 2006, resulting in a further two-year delay. The approach spans, consisting of seven pairs of concrete columns—five on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side—were completed in March 2008. In November 2008, construction worker Sherman Jones died in an accident.\n\nThe arches are made of 106 pieces—53 per arch—mostly cast in place sections. The arch was constructed from both sides of the bridge concurrently, supported by diagonal cable stays strung from temporary towers. The twin arch spans were completed with the casting of the center segments in August 2009. That same month, the two halves of the arch were completed, and were apart; the gap was filled with a block of reinforced concrete. The temporary cable stays were removed, leaving the arch self-supporting. By December, all eight of the vertical piers on the arch had been set and capped, and at the end of the month the first two of thirty-six steel girders had been set into place.\n\nBy mid-April 2010, all of the girders were set in place, and for the first time construction crews could walk across the structure from Arizona to Nevada. Shortly thereafter, the pouring of the bridge deck began. The bridge deck was fully paved in July, and the high-line cranes were removed from the site as the overall project neared completion. The bridge was completed with a dedication ceremony on October 14, 2010. and a grand opening party on October 16. It was opened to bicycle and pedestrian traffic on October 18 and to vehicular traffic on October 19, a few weeks earlier than estimated. The building of the bridge was featured in episode 5x02 of the TV series \"Extreme Engineering\". The filming of this episode took place before the start of work on the arch.\n\nWhen the bridge opened to traffic, the roadway over Hoover Dam was closed to through traffic, and all visitor access to the dam was routed to the Nevada side; vehicles are still allowed to drive across the dam to the Arizona side following a security inspection, but must return to the Nevada side to return to US 93. The former US 93 route between the dam and its junction with the present US 93 route has been re-designated as Nevada State Route 172. The highway using the bridge was given the added designation of Interstate 11 in 2018, after the completion of the Boulder City freeway bypass.\n\nIn late 2004, the proposed bridge name honoring Mike O'Callaghan and Pat Tillman was announced at a ceremony by the Governor of Nevada, Kenny Guinn, and the Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano. O’Callaghan, a decorated Korean War veteran, was the Governor of Nevada from 1971 through 1979, and he was the executive editor at the \"Las Vegas Sun\" newspaper for many years until his death on March 5, 2004. Tillman had been a football player for Arizona State University and for the Arizona Cardinals. He gave up his multimillion-dollar career in the National Football League to enlist as an infantryman in the U.S. Army, but he was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan on April 22, 2004.\n\nStrong winds gusting across the Black Canyon on September 15, 2006, appear to have been the cause for the collapse of the \"high-line\" crane system that was used to carry workmen and materials at the bridge site. No injuries or fatalities occurred because of this accident. Limited construction work resumed in October 2006, but this accident caused a two-year delay in construction.\n\nThe bridge-construction companies Obayashi Corp. and PSM Construction, USA, Inc. absorbed the cost of the debris removal and the rebuilding of the cranes. The reconstruction contract for the cranes was awarded to Cincinnati's F&M Mafco Inc.\n\nWork was halted when a Las Vegas construction worker, 48-year-old Sherman Jones, was killed. A jack punctured his chest during construction while adjusting a cable used to align temporary concrete towers.\n\nThe first known suicide at the bridge took place on April 7, 2012. Federal officials were unable to persuade the victim not to jump from the pedestrian walkway overlooking the dam. Others have happened since. Representatives of the Nevada Department of Transportation \"are constantly monitoring the situation,\" and were \"planning to discuss potential preventative measures on the bypass bridge\" at their August or September 2012 meeting.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They can be up to 40 cm long (including the tail), are considered a pest in the cereal crops and gardens of India and Sri Lanka, and emit piglike grunts when attacking. The name bandicoot is derived from the Telugu language word \"pandikokku\", which translates loosely to \"pig-rat\". Like the better known rats in the genus \"Rattus\", bandicoot rats are members of the family Muridae. Their fur is dark or (rarely) pale brown dorsally, occasionally blackish, and light to dark grey ventrally. The head-body length is around 250 mm, and the uniformly dark tail is shorter than the head-body length.\n\nThe lesser bandicoot and two other species are nocturnal or most active at twilight. They construct burrows to nest and bear their litters. The number of bandicoot babies can range from two to 18. Their staple diet is grains, fruit, and invertebrates. They are prone to destroying cultivated crops in fields. Of all the three species, the lesser bandicoot is an especially aggressive burrower and has been reported to make tunnels in concrete cellars. These are one of several animals called \"chuchundra\" in the Nepali language. In Sri Lanka, the bandicoot rat is known as \"heen uru-meeya\" හීන් ඌරු මීයා in Sinhala language, the meaning of which directly translates to \"lesser pig-rat\".\nThese rats are also known to inhabit houses in villages and are particularly aggressive when threatened. The controls are done by mechanical (mouse trap etc.), rodenticides and biological control (by introducing rodent diseases etc.)\n\nFemale can have up to 10 litters. Young (10-12 per litter) are born blind and naked. Young reach sexual maturity around 60 days after birth. Lifespan of adults is about 8–9 months.\n\nCommonly, it lives in cultivated plains and gardens and is one of the most destructive pests to crops and cultivation. It digs burrows with characteristic pile of earth around the entrance, hence its name. The burrow system is extensive and elaborate, consisting of numerous chambers (sleeping, storing, etc.), galleries and exits or 'bolt-holes', which are covered with loose earth, facilitating an easy escape during emergencies. The storage chambers are stocked with large amounts of grain, specially during harvest time. Usually, one mole-rat is found in one burrow, except when a mother is with young. It has a habit of erecting its long guard hairs scattered over the back and emitting harsh grunts when disturbed.\n\nIt is a carrier of and spreads many diseases such as;\n\nWarfarin is a first-generation anticoagulant that relies on multiple feeding events to achieve lethality in susceptible rodents. The majority of lesser bandicoot rats are highly susceptible to warfarin, where according to one experiment, one female animal has survived a high dose of active ingredient (79.1 mg kg-1).\n\nTriptolide has been reported to cause sterility in male rats and mice. Triptolide treatment affected the histomorphology of the uterus of these rats by causing a decrease in lumen and columnar cell height and number of uterine glands and ovary by increasing the number of atretic follicles and decreasing the number of developing follicles.\n\nLesser bandicoot rats appear to be averse to scilliroside at all concentrations in food baits. Maximum mortality attained on free-choice feeding on scilliroside is 90% among the individuals.\n\n"}

{"id": "1865606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865606", "title": "Maharbal", "text": "Maharbal\n\nMaharbal (, ; centuryBC) was a Numidian army commander in charge of the cavalry under Hannibal and his second-in-command during the Second Punic War. Maharbal was a very close friend to Hannibal and admired him greatly. He was often critical to the battlefield success of Carthage over Rome. Throughout his Italian campaign Hannibal maintained numerical superiority in cavalry, and thus relied upon them and Maharbal to give his army an advantage.\n\nMaharbal is best known for what he possibly said during a conversation with Hannibal immediately following the Battle of Cannae. According to Livy, Maharbal strongly urged an immediate march on the city of Rome. Hannibal responded by saying \"I commend your zeal, but I need time to weigh the plan which you propose.\" \"Maharbal then replied, \"Assuredly, no one man has been blessed with all God's gifts. You, Hannibal, know how to gain a victory; you do not know how to use it.\" The Latin for the last sentence of the conversation is: \"\"Vincere scis, Hannibal; victoria uti nescis.\"\"\n\nMaharbal was a son of Himilco. He was first mentioned as commanding the besieging force at the siege of Saguntum (219 BC) in the absence of the commander-in-chief Hannibal. According to Livy, he carried on the operations with such vigour that Hannibal's absence was hardly felt. After Hannibal arrived in Italy, he was sent with a body of cavalry to ravage the plains near the Po in northern Italy. He was recalled to join his commander for the battle on the Ticinus (218 BC) where the consul Publius Cornelius Scipio was seriously wounded and his son, Scipio Africanus, first made an appearance in Roman history.\n\nAt Lake Trasimene, 6000 Romans who had escaped from the battle occupied a strong position in one of the neighbouring villages. These survivors were induced to lay down their arms, on receiving from Maharbal a promise of safety. Hannibal, however, refused to ratify the capitulation, alleging that Maharbal had exceeded his powers. He dismissed, without ransom, all those men who belonged to the Italian allies, and only retained the Roman citizens as prisoners of war. Maharbal, despite being a cavalry commander, led Iberian skirmishers and infantry to round up the Romans who had survived the battle. \n\nThe consul Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, who was en route to meet with his co-consul Gaius Flaminius, had sent his cavalry ahead, led by the praetor Gaius Centenius. After the battle of Trasimene, Maharbal (leading a detachment of spear-men and cavalry) successfully intercepted Centinius and his detachment of 4000 cavalry. When Maharbal's force met with Centenius half of the Romans were killed, and the rest retreated. The surviving Roman cavalry were followed to a hill where they eventually surrendered.\n\nAfter this battle, Maharbal was apparently sent with the Numidian cavalry to ravage the rich Falernian plains.\n\nMaharbal's role in this famous battle is uncertain. Roman historians are themselves divided over his presence or absence, and the most reliable of them, Polybius, does not mention his presence at all. According to Livy, Maharbal commanded the right wing of the Carthaginian army at the battle of Cannae, contradicting Polybius's claim that the right wing was commanded by Hanno, son of Bomilcar. Appian agrees with Polybius, however, and assigns Maharbal on that occasion the command of the reserve of cavalry instead.\n\nLivy claims that immediately after the victory, Maharbal urged Hannibal to push on at once with his cavalry upon Rome itself, promising him that if he did so, within five days he should sup in the Capitol. On the refusal of his commander to do so, Maharbal is said to have observed that Hannibal knew indeed how to gain victories, but not how to use them. However, modern historians judge Hannibal's decision more reasonably than did William Smith and his contemporaries. They point to the fact that Hannibal's army was exhausted, that Rome was able to raise fresh legions, that Rome itself was defended by formidable walls, and that Hannibal had no siege machinery.\n\nMaharbal's fate after the Battle of Casilinum, is not known. A person of that name is mentioned by Frontinus as employed by the Carthaginians against some African tribes that had rebelled. However, it is not clear if this is the same Maharbal as Hannibal's cavalry commander. He may have died around the time of the siege of Casilinium, or shortly thereafter.\n\n"}

{"id": "1865634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865634", "title": "John Granger", "text": "John Granger\n\nJohn Granger is a speaker and writer whose principal focus is the intersection of literature, faith and culture. He is most well known as the author of several books analysing J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" novels. He writes a weblog called \"Hogwarts Professor,\" and contributes to podcasts on \"Mugglenet.\"\n\nGranger was born in Corning, New York and grew up in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and the University of Chicago, where he studied classical languages and literature. Granger has a Master of Fine Arts (Creative Writing) from Oklahoma City University and is currently writing his PhD thesis at Swansea University (Wales). Previously he taught Latin and English at The Asheville School, Peninsula College, and Valley Forge Military Academy.\n\nGranger served for 6 years in the US Marine Corps including postings at the Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms, California, and at Camp Butler, Okinawa, Japan. He is married to Mary, is a reader in the Orthodox Church, and has seven children.\n\nDescribed as \"The Dean of Harry Potter Scholars\" his specialisation is iconological literary criticism, reading at four layers: the surface, moral, allegorical, and sublime (anagogical). Writing about \"Harry Potter\" from this perspective, he introduced the 'Eliade thesis' to suggest a textual cause for Potter mania explaining Rowling's use of Christian Symbolism and Rowling's use of literary alchemy. Granger has demonstrated Rowling's use of 'ring composition' or \"chiasmus\" story scaffolding and eye symbolism in the Harry Potter novels, and argued that her eye symbolism in \"Deathly Hallows\" and the King's Cross scene Rowling describes as \"the key\" to the seven novels suggests her baseline theme is \"transformed vision\".\n\nGranger brings the same literary criticism model to the allegorical and anagogical aspects of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga, Suzanne Collins' \"Hunger Games\" trilogy and C. S. Lewis’ \"Chronicles of Narnia.\"\n\nHe has been a featured speaker at Harry Potter conferences in Orlando, Las Vegas, Toronto, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Illinois, San Francisco, Chicago, Chestnut Hill, Washington, D.C., St Andrews and Ottawa in addition to giving talks and classes on symbolist literature and iconological criticism at schools and other venues around the US. Granger has been a guest speaker at the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University, California, Pepperdine, Washington & Lee, La Salle, Cornell, Penn, Yale, University of Chicago, Baylor, St Andrews, the Wade Center at Wheaton College, Loyola, Augustana, UNC, USC, the New York C. S. Lewis Society, New York Public Library, and the Past Watchful Dragons C. S. Lewis Conference. He has given more than 100 radio, newspaper, and television interviews and is featured in the A&E Special 'Secrets of Harry Potter' that is an \"Order of the Phoenix\" DVD Extra.\n\nIn respect to the Harry Potter series, Granger holds, contrary to several Christian critics of the series – including Berit Kjos and Richard Abanes – that the books' magic is incantational rather than invocational, and, as such, require and support a Christian worldview rather than undermine it. Granger has debated Abanes and Catholic Potter critic Michael O’Brien on the Christian content and value of Rowling's work. This argument was later validated by Rowling in her 2007 Open Book Tour, when she commented that she thought the Christian symbolism and content of the \"Harry Potter\" novels was \"obvious\".\n\nLatter-day Saint critics of Granger's exploration of Stephanie Meyers’ Mormonism and its place in her \"Twilight\" novels have dismissed his work as a cursory engagement with Mormonism, uncovering subtlety where none was intended, giving Meyer the benefit of doubts never demanded, and getting Mormon popular culture plain wrong. Granger has been defended by BYU Professor Steven Walker, who Stephanie Meyer has cited as the professor who had the greatest influence on her. Walker, who is also a believing Mormon, has commented that Granger has persuaded him that \"Meyer’s religious thought is so crucial to her fiction that to read it without consideration of the theology is to miss much of the point\", and that Granger's work succeeds in deepening Christian's reading of theology, showing that readers enter fully into the stories because of religious depths and heights which the \"Twilight\" novels share with the best English literature.\n\nGranger first became interested in Harry Potter when his daughter was given a copy of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\". He read the book with the intention of pointing out to his daughter what was wrong with it but instead was impressed by the Christian imagery, classical references, and 'acerbic criticism of muggledom'. Granger's interest grew through discussion with friends in the Port Townsend C. S. Lewis Society. He gave lectures on the subject at the Society and the town's Carnegie Library which lectures were eventually collected into a book, 'Hidden Key to Harry Potter' (Zossima Press, 2002). That book was re-written and re-titled first 'Looking for God in Harry Potter' (Tyndale, 2004, 2006) and now 'How Harry Cast His Spell' (Tyndale, 2008).\n\nThis book in its updated and revised forms argues that the Harry Potter novels are as popular as they are because of their traditional symbolism and spiritual content. Granger believes, following Mircea Eliade, that because forms of entertainment in a secular or profane culture serve a mythic and religious function; the most popular works will be those with transcendent imagery, structure, and meaning.\n\nGranger taught Harry Potter courses on the online Barnes and Noble University and as a guest in their Book Clubs from 2004 to 2007. He has also appeared as a guest in favor of the Harry Potter books on several radio and TV shows, including CNN's Paula Zahn Now, MSNBC, and A&E's The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter (which special is on the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix DVD). Having been the first to note and explain the traditional alchemical and Christian imagery in the novels, he has become involved in the debate with those who criticize Ms. Rowling's novels, critics who believe the adventure stories encourage children to consider paganism and witchcraft as alternative faiths. In The Deathly Hallows Lectures, he explains the predominant eye symbolism of the series finale in light of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's natural theology and the consequent tradition of eye and mirror symbolism in Romantic literature.\n\nOther works (through written contribution or editing) include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865650", "title": "Tropical Storm Amelia (1978)", "text": "Tropical Storm Amelia (1978)\n\nTropical Storm Amelia was a weak but catastrophic tropical storm that was the second-wettest tropical cyclone on record in the continental United States. Amelia developed from a tropical wave that moved through the Atlantic Ocean uneventfully. The disturbance then entered an area of the Gulf of Mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became the first tropical depression of the season, after which it was forecast to make landfall before any significant intensification. However, the tropical depression defied predictions, quickly strengthening into a weak tropical storm just hours before making landfall in Corpus Christi. The storm lasted roughly a day over land before becoming unidentifiable after being active for just under 48 hours. After dissipating, the storm caused a severe flooding disaster in Texas.\n\nAmelia affected the Texas coast for two days which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in from as far away as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33 fatalities with an estimated $110 million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean for the next week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come together two days later due to the influence of anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.\n\nOn July 30, the disturbance turned to the northwest and entered an area of the Gulf with slightly above normal sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear, which favored further development. At this point, the presentation seen on satellite imagery had indicated that a tropical cyclone was beginning to form in the Gulf. After a reconnaissance aircraft went into the system, the cyclone was upgraded into the first tropical depression of the season that afternoon while south of Brownsville, Texas. When it formed, it was moving north-northwest at , which was thought at the time to inhibit further strengthening due to the depression moving onto land. Several hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Amelia, a decision that one forecaster said was made to be on the safe side. Amelia peaked at in wind speed when it was upgraded, with the system beginning to skirt the Texas coast. At peak intensity, the storm had gale-force winds along a diameter of .\n\nAmelia, which never had a well-defined center, went up the coast during the afternoon and evening of July 30, making landfall in Corpus Christi the next day. The system was tracked until passing just west of San Antonio, where it became indiscernible after the morning of August 1. The storm was active for a short span of time — just under two days — forming and dissipating so quickly that, following the storm, there was some controversy about the reliability of the weather forecasters.\n\nWhile the storm was over water, small craft advisories were issued by the Coast Guard in addition to cautioning people on vacation in South Padre Island to avoid the beaches. However, as it was a Sunday evening, most of the ships were already coming into port. As Amelia approached the Texas coast, gale warnings were issued for the area from Brownsville to Port O'Connor on July 30. Due to it forming in close proximity to the coast, warnings were issued as soon as the storm was named. As the state had been in the midst of a severe drought the previous six weeks, there was hope that Amelia would relieve the dry conditions. However, the drought conditions would benefit the floods from the storm due to the ground being rendered so dry that it was unable to soak up all the rain from the storm.\n\nEffects from Amelia as a tropical cyclone ranged from winds in Brownsville to gusts of up to in Corpus Christi. Inland Texas fared much worse, though. The continuous flow of tropical moisture during Amelia's dissipation and remnant stage brought heavy flooding for two to three days, putting 25 counties under flash flood warnings. The orographic effect of the Edwards Plateau enhanced the flooding, leading to rainfall totals as high as in a two-day period. Although the showers stretched into Dallas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, any damages from the storm in these areas are unknown. The final toll from the storm was 33 dead, most of which occurred a week after the storm made landfall, and $110 million in damage. Most of the damage was located in two specific areas: an area consisting of the towns of Albany and Graham, and the Texas Hill Country, although light flooding was reported elsewhere.\n\nIn coastal areas of Texas, damage was limited to the sinking of several shrimp boats and the beaching of sail boats. One ship — the \"Mermaid of the Sea\" — was caught in the middle of the storm. Although it sank, its crew was rescued. A pleasure boat with three occupants and the two-man crew of a beached catamaran were all reported missing, but were later found. Three other people on board a fishing vessel were treated for exposure. Rescue ships were hampered by anchored Mexican boats and surfers in a channel near the Coast Guard station. According to the Coast Guard, all nine ships that had been reported missing in the storm were later accounted for. Along with the ships, an oil drilling rig in the Gulf was ripped from its location and ran aground near Matagorda Island by the storm. The 19 crew members of the rig were rescued by helicopter. As the rig had not yet begun drilling, there was no threat from an oil spill.\n\nIn Port Isabel, there was some flooding on the southeast part of the town which was alleviated when some of the manhole covers were opened. In addition, a tornado was thought to have touched down, causing minor damage. South Padre Island reported power outages after receiving over of rain and the Queen Isabella Causeway was rendered nearly impassable due to rainfall. During its time as a tropical cyclone, there were no deaths linked to Amelia.\n\nThe town of Albany was hit hard when the town drainage system and Hubbard Creek both flooded. The ensuing torrent destroyed 25–30 houses and a dozen businesses and damaged hundreds more while inundating 80% of the town. In addition, all incoming roads were flooded, the pavement on U.S. Route 283 was washed away, and a bridge on U.S. Route 180 buckled, preventing anyone from entering or leaving on land. The town's water supply was contaminated and the electricity and communications were also knocked out. The death toll from Albany was set at nine dead and twelve missing, although the town sheriff said that four people who were missing would likely never be found due to several cave-ins along the creek, possibly burying them up to deep in mud. Rescue efforts here were hampered by overflowing creeks and a lack of communication. The rain was also responsible for carving a deep hole in an earthen dam at nearby Lake Throckmorton, but the water from the dam was safely taken up by a nearby creek. The town of Throckmorton itself was completely evacuated and, like Albany, had its fresh water supply contaminated.\n\nNorth of Albany, the Brazos River also flooded, with the Clear Fork Brazos River becoming wide at one point, despite normally being a dry creek bed. The Brazos overflowing, in addition to the flooding of the nearby Salt Creek, resulted in the west side of Graham — the county seat of Young County where flood victims from Eliasville and South Bend had taken shelter — becoming flooded over to within blocks of the Young County Courthouse. Later, the flood waters were reported to have entered the basement of the courthouse. Effects from the flooding in Graham ranged from 150 houses and 40–50 businesses being inundated to the loss of water and electrical utilities. No fatalities were reported, however, due to the water levels rising gradually, leaving time for residents to evacuate. The crest of the Brazos flood then headed for the Possum Kingdom Lake with a threat of lowland flooding, resulting in evacuations of riverside towns in Parker and Palo Pinto counties, although a report from Palo Pinto said that no flooding was expected. The flooding was alleviated at the Possum Kingdom Lake, as the lake was already down from normal and some of the floodgates there were opened, taking most of the water from the flood. Elm Creek, near Abilene, also swelled, flooding into the town, but the only reported damage there was street flooding. An additional death was reported in the town of Morse.\n\nThe hardest hit area during the storm was the Guadalupe River basin and its tributaries. A sign of the oncoming problem was a wall of water witnessed cascading down the Leona River in Uvalde. Like with Graham, Uvalde was ultimately flooded up to a block away from the courthouse. The Guadalupe River became heavily flooded, rising in one hour. The rapid rise covered a bridge on U.S. Route 281, north of San Antonio and prompted evacuations in a area near the flood plains. The overflowing river was responsible for ten total deaths in Kendall and Kerr Counties and submerging Comfort under seven feet of water, killing four people there. The towns of Welfare and Center Point were also reported to be flooded. In nearby Hunt, a group of military personnel who entered the region to assist with rescues got stranded themselves. After receding, the Guadalupe steadily became filled again, prompting re-evacuations. Near Stonewall, the Pedernales overflowed its banks, covering the area in up to of water and swamping the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. The only overflow to emanate from Mexico was from the Rio Conchos, which dumped its overflowing water into the Rio Grande and subsequently damaged the international bridge between Mexico and the United States in Presidio.\n\nThe worst impact was confined to Bandera County. The impact in the county stemmed from flooding of the Medina River which, infused with high rainfall, produced a 500-year flood. In Bandera, the Medina turned into a wall of water, which destroyed several of the trees along the river in addition to causing various items to litter the roads. In isolated areas, there was an odor from decaying livestock. Two people were witnessed clinging to a roof that was swept into the Medina. A further 100 people were cut off due to the river flood. 10–15 houses were washed away and the courthouse became an evacuation center by virtue of being the only area above the water. Electricity and all phone lines save the Sheriff Department line were knocked out in the city and several houses that were still standing had standing water inside them. At the riverfront Camp Bandina, eight people were reported killed while 100 children escaped by staying at the church camp nearby. The Peaceful Valley Ranch was nearly decimated, with only the building foundations still remaining. Six people were killed by the floods while sleeping while 20 guests and staff rode out the storm by clinging to trees and roofs for six hours. The town of Medina was rendered inaccessible by road after the Medina combined with the Sabinal River. There were also reports of looting in the county, but no arrests were made. One of the survivors of the flooding in this area was former Miss USA Kimberly Tomes, whose family was vacationing at a dude ranch in the area. After leaving and grabbing onto a tree, she witnessed cars and mobile homes passing by.\n\nFollowing the storm, there was some controversy as to the nature of the storms. A cloud seeding project was underway near Albany only hours before the town was hit with flooding. However, the rains were determined to have been tropical in origin. At the request of Governor Dolph Briscoe, President Jimmy Carter declared Kendall, Kerr, and Bandera Counties as disaster areas, allowing citizens in these areas to receive federal aid. All three counties had previously been declared disaster areas due to the prior drought. Later, three more counties — Young, Shackleford, and Haskell — were added to the list. Briscoe described the disaster as one of the worst floods in the history of the state. Evacuation centers were set up in Kerrville, Comfort, and Center Point to allow refugees to wait out the floods. In Bandera, 300 people applied for relief and 200 mobile homes were sent to help the homeless. The cafeteria of the junior high school was used as both a morgue and a Red Cross emergency center. \n\nIn Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped organize a relief effort for the Texas town of the same name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight was funded by the Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.\n\nAmelia and its remnants set several records for rainfall and flooding. The Medina River crested at , breaking the record for flood stage reached on the river that was set in 1919 at as well as breaking the record for water flow, or the rate in which water flows down the river, at 79 billion gallons per day. Additionally, the Brazos River had its highest flooding since 1957. Records were also set for flowing on the Guadalupe, which flowed at 149 billion gallons a day, more than twice the previous record and nearly 1500 times its usual rate of 100 million gallons per day. The storm total of measured at Medina was the wettest known storm total rainfall amount for both the state of Texas and any tropical cyclone impacting the continental United States until Hurricane Harvey in 2017. A 12-hour total of of rain at Abilene was an extreme example of the precipitation.\n\nIn addition, with genesis occurring at a longitude of 97.0°W Amelia holds the record for the westernmost formation of a tropical cyclone in the North Atlantic hurricane database, which dates back to 1851.\n\n\n"}

It lies north-west of Tehran on the main highway to Tabriz and Turkey and approximately from the Caspian Sea. The city is located about 20 kilometers south of the Qaflankuh Mountain Range. At the 2016 census, its population was 521,302 which is the 20th largest city in Iran. The population of Zanjan consists mostly of Iranian Azeris who can also speak the Azerbaijani language. Zanjan is 21733 square kilometers.\n\nZanjan is known for its beautiful handcrafts such as knives, traditional sandals, called charoogh, and malileh, a handcraft made with silver wires. Zanjani artists make many things like various decorative dishes and their special covers as well as silver jewelry. In ancient times, Zanjan was known for its stainless and sharp knives. But this tradition is gradually becoming extinct by introduction of Chinese-made knives into the market which are far cheaper, more abundant and less artistic . Many villagers today are traditional carpet weavers, perhaps Zanjan's most popular handcraft. Zanjan's population boasts the highest level of happiness among the people of 30 other provinces in Iran, according to a detailed survey conducted by Isna.\n\nHamdollah Mostowfi, the Iranian traveler and historian, in his book claims that Zanjan was built by Ardashir I, the first king of the Sassanid Empire and named as \"Shahin\". One important moment in the history of the city was in 1851 when the city became a center for the suppressed Babi religious movement, along with Neyriz and a fortress known as Shaykh Tabarsi. The forces of the central government captured the Babi fort in Zanjan after a long siege on the orders of Grand Vizier (Prime Minister of Iran) Amir Kabir and killed or expelled the Bab's followers. According to Bosworth, who quotes Hamdollah Mostowfi, the inhabitants during the Ilkhanid era spoke \"pure Pahlawi\", a Median or northern form of Persian.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, rainfed agriculture makes up around 42% of Zanjan's land cover and grasslands account for another 37%. The remainder is bareland, irrigated agriculture, forest, orchard and riverbanks. Only 1.07% of the land is urban development.\n\nZanjan has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSk\") with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters, often with snowfall. Precipitation is very low, and mostly falls between October and May.\n\nZanjan's bazaar is a public marketplace that started in Agha Mohammadkhan Ghajar-era in 1784 CE, and completed in 1792 CE during the Fath-Ali Shah-era. Mosques and a bath were added later. This bazaar has 940 shops, which consist of two defined parts, namely Bazaar-e Bala (upper bazaar) and Bazaar-e Paieen (lower bazaar). Vendors are organized by their professions and commodities.\n\nThe central mosque of Zanjan is also known as the Seyyed Mosque (Masjid-e-Seyyed), this was constructed in 1826 during the Qajar-era, by one of Fath-Ali Shah's sons. This mosque was built in the old area of the city and it's the religious center of Zajan.\n\nIt's built on Imam Street. This building holds six naturally preserved human remains called saltmen or “namaki”, which had been discovered in 1993 in the Chehrabad salt mines. These remains are originally from Achaemenian-era. \n\nTofighi's building is related to last parts of Qajar-era and Pahlavi-era. It's built on Imam Street. It was a house of the greatest man of Zanjan that was mayor of city. This building has 2 floors and consists of a symmetrical form.\n\nMatch company is related to Pahlavi's era and located on Safa street. It has a beautiful head. It is the second company of city and constructed before the second world war by Mahmud Shalchi. It has an exclusive brick chimney.\n\nThe old abbey was constructed 200 years ago in the area of Enghelab square which is the most central and oldest part of Zanjan. It initially served as a caravanserai and then for approx. 80 years it was the house of one of Zanjan's scholars, Sheikh Jalal Ashabi. \n\nIt had been uninhabited for 20 years after the passing of the Seikh from 1997. It began to be renovated in 2017 and now serves as a traditional hotel.\n\nThe Sangi Caravanserai (stone caravanserai) is an ancient roadside inn, constructed in Safavi-era and was converted into a restaurant in the 1990s. It's a single story stone building that has four iwans (porches) and a ceiling that is arcuate.\n\nA historical wash-house and Iranian national heritage site, that is currently being used as Zanjan anthropological museum.\n\n•Lead\n\n•Zinc\n\n•Pasteurized milk\n\n•Chemical productions\n\n•Weaving\n\n•Cotton\n\n•Food productions\n\n•Transformator\n\n•Electrical productions\n\nThe most famous handicrafts are knives, charuq (a local style of women's shoes, similar to clodhopper shoes), filigree and gilding.

He principally wrote about the lives of the poor farmers and fishermen, both in his native Norway and among the Norwegian immigrants in the United States.\nHe was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.\n\nBojer was born Johan Kristoffer Hansen in the village of Ørkedalsøren, now the town of Orkanger, Sør-Trøndelag county. The son of unmarried parents, he grew up as a foster child in a poor family living in Rissa near Trondheim, Norway. Bojer learned early the realities of poverty. His early years were spent working on a farm and working as a bookkeeper. After the death of his father in 1894, he took the name Bojer.\n\nHis literary work began with the publication of \"Unge tanker\" in 1893, and continued to gather strength through the 1920s. Because of the range of topics he addressed, he won critical acclaim in Norway. He gained international fame after many of his works were published in foreign languages. Critics generally recognize his best work to be his novel, \"\", (English title: \"The Last of the Vikings\"). This novel powerfully and realistically depicts the lives of fishermen from Trøndelag, who spend the winter fishing in the Lofoten island archipelago within the Arctic Circle near the far north coast of Norway.\nBojer is best remembered for \"The Emigrants\", a major novel dealing with the motivations and trials of Norwegians emigrated on the plains of North Dakota. In 1923, Bojer journeyed to Litchville, North Dakota, to research the lives of the Norwegian immigrants who had settled there. The result of his visit became a novel originally published in Norway as \"Vor egen stamme\". Bojer's novel of Norwegian homesteaders in the 1880s tells of young villagers who leave the Old World to seek a better life. Their trek takes them to homesteads in LaMoure County, south of Litchville, North Dakota, where they find that breaking the sod and surviving blizzards are easier than feeling at home in this new land.\n\n\n\n"}

With about 7,000 inhabitants, it is the seat of the District of Shibam in the Governorate of Hadhramaut. Known for its mudbrick-made high-rise buildings, it is referred to as the \"Chicago of the Desert\" (), or \"Manhattan of the Desert\" ().\n\nThe first known inscription about the city dates from the 3rd century CE. It was the capital of the Hadramawt Kingdom.\n\nIn the 20th century, it was one of the three major cities of the Qu'aiti Sultanate, the others being Al-Mukalla and Ash-Shihr.\n\nThe city was listed with the UNESCO World Heritage List, in 1982.\n\nIn 2008, a tropical cyclone flooded Shibam.\n\nDuring the Yemen Civil War the city suffered some damage after insurgents detonated a car bomb. There was also coalition bombing in the area.\n\nIn 2015 UNESCO listed the city as \"cultural heritage at risk\".\n\nThe town is located in the central-western area of Hadhramaut Governorate, in the desert of Ramlat al-Sab'atayn. Its main road links Sana'a and other cities of western Yemen to the far eastern territories. Nearest towns are Seiyun, seat of an airport, and Tarim, both in the east. Another road, departing from the village of Alajlanya, in the west, links Shibam to Mukalla, the governorate's capital, located by the Indian Ocean.\n\nShibam has a hot desert climate (Köppen: \"BWh\"). At an average temperature of 28.0 °C, June is the hottest month of the year. January is the coldest month, with temperatures averaging .\nShibam, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud brick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which rise 5 to 11 storeys high, with each floor having one or two rooms. This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses originate from the 16th century. Many, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.\n\nShibam is often called \"the oldest skyscraper city in the world\". It is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud.\n\nThe city is surrounded by a fortified wall, giving it the name \"the walled city of Shibam\".\n\nThe nearby town of Tarim contains the tallest structure in the Wadi Hadhramaut valley, the mudbrick minaret of the Al-Mihdhar mosque. It stands at a height of approximately 53.. This is the tallest minaret in the southern Arabian peninsula.\n\nThe mudbrick buildings are frequently threatened by wind, rain, and heat erosion, and require constant upkeep in order to maintain their structures. The city was heavily affected by flooding from a tropical cyclone in 2008. The foundations of many of the buildings in the city were compromised by the flood waters, eventually leading to their collapse. It was also the target of an Al Qaeda attack in 2009.\n\nIn 2015, Shibam was added to the list of World Heritage sites in Danger when violent civil war erupted in Yemen.

With the decline of dancing as a form of entertainment, Dana began a singing career. He is best known for his 1965 recording of the Sid Tepper & Roy C. Bennett song \"Red Roses for a Blue Lady\" that was a Billboard Top Ten hit single. His album of the same title made it into the Top Twenty. Preceding this success as a solo artist, Dana was the lead singer of The Fleetwoods (for live performances only), replacing original vocalist Gary Troxel when Troxel went into the U.S. Navy.\n\nOther hit recordings on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in the 1960s: \"Little Altar Boy\", \"I Will\", \"More\", \"Shangri-La\", \"I Love You Drops\", and \"If I Never Knew Your Name.\" \"I Love You Drops\" was written and recorded by country singer Bill Anderson, and was popular enough to be recorded by others including Don Cherry and Teresa Brewer. He also scored a chart record in 1970 with Neil Diamond's \"Red Red Wine,\" years before it was turned into a number one hit by UB40. His last nationally charted record was Larry Weiss' \"Lay Me Down (Roll Me Out To Sea)\" on the Casino label, which hit the top 20 on Billboard's \"Easy Listening\" survey.\n\nSix Dana songs reached the \"Music Vendor\" (later \"Record World\") charts without appearing in the \"Billboard\" charts.\n\nDana had a brief foray as an actor on three TV appearances, first in 1965 on the series \"Burke's Law\" in the episode \"Who Killed Wimbledon Hastings?\" as Forrest Shea, and then in 1966 on the WWII drama \"Combat!\" in the episode \"Ask Me No Questions\" as Pvt. James. He also appeared in the 1968 television movie \"Shadow Over Elveron\" as Tino.\n\nDana has three children, Steven, Jason and Justin.

In addition to publishing monolingual dictionaries, Langenscheidt also publishes bilingual dictionaries and travel phrase-books.\n\nLangenscheidt has language-to-language dictionaries in many languages, including: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Greek, Ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Chinese and Croatian, and in varying sizes, ranging from small travel pocket dictionaries to large desk sized ones.\n\nThe Langenscheidt Publishing Group was founded on 1 October 1856 by Gustav Langenscheidt, in response to other publishers' refusal to publish self-study materials developed by him for learning French, which he subsequently published under the title \"Unterrichtsbriefe zur Erlernung der französischen Sprache\" (\"Teaching letters for learning the French language\"). These learning materials became very popular and were widely read, so today Langenscheidt can be considered the \"Father of distance education\". From 1867 Langenscheidt Publishing Group had its own printing press.\n\nFrom 1869 Langenscheidt worked with Karl Sachs and Césaire Villatte on the \"Encyklopädisches französisch-deutsches und deutsch-französisches Wörterbuch\" (\"Encyclopedic French-German and German-French dictionary\") and published it in 1880. In 1874, Langenscheidt was awarded the title of professor.\n\nIn 1891, in close collaboration with Eduard Muret and Daniel Sanders, he started working on the English equivalent, the \"Encyklopädisches englisch-deutsches und deutsch-englisches Wörterbuch\" (\"Encyclopedic English-German and German-English dictionary\"). Langenscheidt did not live to see its publication; his son Carl, his successor, published it in 1901.\n\nThe structure for most Langenscheidt dictionaries is the same. Most pocket dictionaries include around 55,000 references designed for tourists or people studying beginning or intermediate foreign languages, while larger desk sized interlanguage dictionaries include around 220,000 references. After the two languages' references conclude, grammatical assistance appears in the Appendix section, including helpful abbreviations, geographical regions, currency values, temperature conversions, and numerical values.\n\n"}

Her father Jacques d'Arc, mother Isabelle Romée, and uncle beg her to stay at home, but she leaves them and travels to Vaucouleurs, where she meets with the governor, Captain Robert de Baudricourt. The dissipated Baudricourt initially scorns Joan's ideals, but her zeal eventually wins him over, and he gives her authority to lead French soldiers. Joan and her army lead a triumphal procession into Orléans, followed by a large crowd. Then, in Reims Cathedral, Charles VII is crowned King of France.\n\nAt the Siege of Compiègne, Joan is taken prisoner while her army attempts to storm the castle. In prison, Joan has another dream in which she sees her visions again. Taken to the interrogation, Joan refuses to sign a retraction, and is condemned as a heretic. In the Rouen marketplace, Joan is burned at the stake. The wood carrier at the execution, bringing in fuel for the burning, dies on the spot from the fumes. In a final apotheosis scene, Joan rises to heaven, where she is greeted by God and the saints.\n\n\nThe film was made in the spring of 1900. It was the first of Méliès's films to surpass 200 meters in length, and the second (after his \"Cinderella\" the previous year) to use changes of scene, with twelve sets employed and that number of scenes, or \"tableaux\", advertised. (\"Cinderella\" was advertised as having twenty \"tableaux\", but they were filmed on only six sets; this division of long scenes into smaller segments for advertising purposes would become Méliès's standard practice. \"Joan of Arc\", by contrast, was advertised with twelve scenes, one per set.) The artist Charles Claudel, who also repainted the interior of the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in 1901 following Méliès's designs, was the set painter for the film. The cameraman was Leclerc, who also worked for Méliès as the pianist at the Théâtre Robert-Houdin.\n\nMéliès's scenario for the film strongly emphasizes Joan's status as a national hero of France and a martyr for the French people; the first scene, in which Joan enters leading a flock of sheep, foreshadows her eventual leading of the French army. The final scene, with its triumphal entry of Joan into heaven and her meeting God, suggests Joan's suitability for Catholic sainthood. (Joan of Arc was beatified by the Church in 1909 and canonized in 1920.)\n\nMost of the film is staged in Méliès's usual theatrical style, with a stationary camera viewing the action from afar, in a long shot, as if viewing a stage spectacle from a seat in the audience. However, the eighth scene, the Siege of Compiègne, is notable for a more modern-looking visual effect: in that scene, actors move much closer to the camera, in the distance of a medium shot. This is the second example, among Méliès's extant films, of experiments with medium shots; the first had occurred the previous year in \"Bagarre entre journalistes\", an installment of Méliès's series \"The Dreyfus Affair\".\n\nAn advertisement for the film claims that \"almost 500 people\" can be seen in the grand parade at Orléans, an effect created by having a moderately sized group of people cross the screen from left to right, go around the north side of the studio, and re-enter, repeating the cycle several times to simulate a much larger crowd.\n\n\"Joan of Arc\" was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 264–275 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a \"pièce cinématographique à grand spectacle en 12 tableaux\". As the film scholar Jacques Malthête has noted, Méliès's descriptions of the film in advertising material never mention that Joan's enemies are English; this omission occurs not only in the English-language materials (where mentioning conflict with the French may have been thought harmful to sales), but also in the French ones (where the omission is less understandable).\n\nThe film was Méliès's second big cinematic success (\"Cinderella\" was the first). It was shown widely in France, and was also exhibited elsewhere, including in Montreal and Havana. In England, the film was distributed by the Warwick Trading Company, which handled English releases of Méliès's films until 1902. In the United States, the Edison Manufacturing Company sold \"dupes\" (illegally duplicated prints) of the film. American film piracy became such a problem for Méliès, especially after the success of his much-pirated 1902 film \"A Trip to the Moon\", that he opened an American branch of his company in New York in 1903, under the direction by his brother Gaston Méliès, for added copyright protection.\n\nThe film was believed lost until 1982, when a hand-colored print with the first scene missing was discovered by the collector René Charles.\n\n"}

The purpose of the organization is to defend the rights of journalists and contribute to the development of press freedom throughout the world. CJFE recognizes that these rights are not confined to journalists and strongly supports and defends the broader objective of freedom of expression in Canada and around the world.\n\nCJFE was established in 1981, and parented initially by the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) (now the Canadian Association of Journalists) as the CIJ Latin American Committee. In 1984 the group's name was changed to the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists. Then in 1998 it became Canadian Journalists for Free Expression. Many of the Centre's members were shocked at the life-threatening conditions for journalists working in Latin America during the early 1980s. From 1979 to 1981, some 150 journalists had been killed or disappeared while in the custody of security forces in the region. Moved to action by this violence against their southern counterparts, the CIJ agreed to form a special committee to campaign against the kidnapping, torture and murder of media workers throughout Latin America. It was thus that the CIJ Latin American Committee came into being.\n\nWorking groups were formed in several cities, including Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Ottawa. Each centre maintained files on violations of freedom of expression for different countries in the region, and a \"Red Alert\" network was set up to react to reports of attacks.\n\nA few years later, the group changed its name to the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists and, with it, began to work in other parts of the world.\n\nThere was another name change - this time to reflect the larger free expression mandate of the organization - as well as a significant expansion of activities of CJFE both in Canada and internationally.\n\nOne of the principal activities of CJFE is the management of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of more than 80 non-governmental organisations that monitors free expression violations around the world and defends journalists, writers and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression.\n\nThe CJFE International Press Freedom Awards, which were launched in 1998, have become the signature event of the organization's press freedom awareness activities in Canada. The gala dinner brings together some of the biggest names in Canadian media to honour colleagues from Canada and around the world who have been persecuted because of their work.\n\nTwo awards are given each year to foreign journalists who overcome great odds to report the news. \nPast award winners include Tunisian journalist and human rights activist Sihem Bensedrine, Canadian photographer Zahra Kazemi, Kazakhstani journalist Lira Baysetova and Iranian journalist Akbar Ganji.\n\nCJFE presents three other awards: the Tara Singh Hayer Press Freedom Award, the Vox Libera Award, and the Integrity Award.\n\nThe Tara Singh Hayer Press Freedom Award honours a Canadian journalist who, through his or her work, has made an important contribution to reinforcing and promoting the principle of freedom of the press in this country or elsewhere. The award is named after the Canadian journalist and editor of the Vancouver-based Indo-Canadian Times who was assassinated in November 1998.\n\nThe Vox Libera Award is given to a non-journalist who has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to the principles of free expression and who has had made an important and sustained contribution - at home or abroad - to those same principles.\n\nThe Integrity Award was developed to recognize and build awareness of the need to protect the rights of \"whistleblowers.\" The recipients of this award are individuals who have acted courageously in the public interest without thought of personal gain, and in doing so risked reprisals in the form of threats to their careers, livelihood, or personal freedom.\n\nCJFE operates the Journalists in Distress Fund for the benefit of working journalists in defence of democracy, human rights, justice and freedom of expression. The fund exists primarily to encourage freedom of expression and the practice of journalism, and to provide humanitarian assistance to journalists whose lives and well-being are threatened.\n\nThe Fund provides financial assistance to journalists and their families whose lives are at risk or whose freedom of expression has been seriously infringed. Examples of fundable expenses are medical costs arising from imprisonment or physical mistreatment, legal costs arising from action taken in the courts against journalists because of their reporting as well as emergency travel costs so that journalists and their families can escape persecution.\n\nAmong other cases, the Journalists in Distress Fund has provided emergency assistance to a trio of persecuted Ethiopian journalists who fled to Kenya; a Thai journalist who, after recovering from a shooting, required money to continue publication of his newspaper; and the wife and child of a disappeared Belarusian journalist, who was said to have been abducted on orders of the government.\n\n"}

In the studio Baker and Rayner co-produced the album with hired session musicians and Hugh Padgham as mixer. \"The Makers\" provided three singles, \"Big Picture\" (June 1990), \"New Kind of Blue\" and \"Daylight\" (1990). An album track, \"Simple Things\", was used for another film directed by Tass, \"The Big Steal\" (September 1990).\n\nIn the following year the group were joined by Michael Barker on drums and toured Australia in support of the United States band, the B-52's. The Makers second studio album, \"Hokey Pokey\", was issued in 1992 by Warner Music Australasia. It provided two singles, \"From Now On\" and \"Perfect Crime\" (1992). The group disbanded soon after as both Baker and Rayner pursued solo careers. Baker's second solo album, \"Prague Radio\" (2004) included two tracks co-written with Rayner, \"It's All Love” and \"Head in the Clouds\".\n\n\n"}

It is based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.\n\nI Marine Expeditionary Force is the largest of the three MEFs in the Fleet Marine Force and is often referred to as the \"Warfighting MEF\" for its consistent involvement and contributions in major armed conflicts. It is presently commanded by Lt. Gen. Joseph Osterman. The deputy commander is Brig. Gen.

Corps, themselves being the first-level sub-unit of a \"field army,\" or a numbered, or named, army (e.g., First U.S. Army, or the Army of the Potomac).\n\nDuring the First World War, the 4th Marine Brigade, as part of the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry Division, came under the U.S. Army I Corps, American Expeditionary Forces. With the expansion of the Marine Corps to six divisions and five air wings during the Second World War, the Marine Corps created two \"Amphibious Corps,\" I Marine Amphibious Corps (later re-designated as III Amphibious Corps) and V Amphibious Corps, continuing the custom begun by the Army. Modern Marine Expeditionary Forces, or MEFs (for a time known as Marine \"Amphibious\" [italics added] Forces, or MABs) continue the U.S. Marine Corps legacy as corps-equivalent organizations designated by Roman numerals.\n\nWhen directed, I MEF deploys and is employed as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) in support of Combatant Commander (COCOM) requirements for contingency response or Major Theater War; with appropriate augmentation, serves as the core element of a Joint Task Force (JTF); prepares and deploys combat ready MAGTF’s to support COCOM presence and crisis response; and supports service and COCOM initiatives as required.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The opera was written in 1945 and first performed in 1947. Apollinaire's play, written in 1903, was revised with a sombre prologue by the time it premiered during World War I in France. For the opera, Poulenc incorporated both the farcical and the serious aspects of the original play, which according to one critic displays a \"high-spirited topsy-turveydom\" that conceals \"a deeper and sadder theme – the need to repopulate and rediscover a France ravaged by war.\"\n\nGuillaume Apollinaire was one a group of poets whom Poulenc had met as a teenager. Adrienne Monnier's bookshop, the \"Maison des Amis des Livres\", was a meeting place for \"avant-garde\" writers including Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Paul Éluard and Louis Aragon. Apollinaire, the illegitimate son of a Polish noblewoman, was described by the critic Edward Lockspeiser as the prominent leader of Bohemian life in Montparnasse. Among his achievements were to bring to prominence the painter the Douanier Rousseau, and to invent the term \"surrealism\", of which he was a leading exponent. In June 1917 the audience for the first performance of Apollinaire's \"drame surréaliste\", \"Les Mamelles de Tirésias\", at a theatre in Montmartre included Jean Cocteau, Serge Diaghilev, Léonide Massine, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Erik Satie, and the young Poulenc. Many years later Poulenc said that though he had been immensely amused by the farcical piece it did not occur to him at the time that he would ever set it to music.\n\nPoulenc first set Apollinaire's words to music in his 1919 song cycle \"La Bestiaire\", and returned to the poet's work for the choral work \"Sept chansons\" (1936). During the 1930s he first thought of setting \"Les mamelles de Tirésias\" as an opera; in 1935 he adapted the script as a libretto, with the blessing of Apollinaire's widow, and began sketching the music in 1939, with most of the composition done in a burst of creativity between May and October 1944. Although the play was written in 1903, by the time of its premiere France was in the thick of the First World War, and Apollinaire had revised the piece, adding a sombre prologue. Poulenc aimed to reflect both the farcical and the serious aspects of the play. The critic Jeremy Sams describes the opera as \"high-spirited topsy-turveydom\" concealing \"a deeper and sadder theme – the need to repopulate and rediscover a France ravaged by war.\"\n\nWith Mme Apollinaire's approval, Poulenc changed the date and setting from those of the original. \"I chose 1912 because that was Apollinaire's heroic period, of the first fights for Cubism ... I substituted Monte-Carlo for Zanzibar to avoid the exotic, and because Monte-Carlo, which I adore, and where Apollinaire spent the first 15 years of his life, is quite tropical enough for the Parisian that I am.\"\n\nKaminski writes that the music, while in the line of Offenbach, Chabrier and Ravel's \"L'heure espagnole\", impresses the listener with its stream of \"miniatures and vignettes\", dances (a valse for Thérèse, a polka for Lacouf and Presto) and pastiches from other lyric music such as ariettes in the style of \"opéra comique\" or chorales (after the duel).\n\nThe opera premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 June 1947 with costumes and décor by Erté. Poulenc recalled, \"The ravishing sets Erté designed for the Opera-Comique with, in the Finale, those lamps in the style of a 1914 restaurant car, were exactly what I was after. As for the ladies' clothes, they were exact copies of the dresses (what at the time were called 'toilettes') that Erté had designed for Poiret's 1912 collection.\"\n\nThe opera was revived in Paris in 1972, followed by Lille in 1985 and Saint-Étienne in 1989. Outside France it was seen in Massachusetts in 1953, Basel in 1957, and at Aldeburgh in 1958 in an arrangement by the composer for two pianos (played by Poulenc and Benjamin Britten; Peter Pears sang the role of Thérèse's husband, transposed to suit his range.). Further local premieres took place in Philadelphia in 1959, New York in 1960, Milan in 1963, London in 1979, Düsseldorf in 1982, Tokyo in 1985, \nand at the Barcelona Liceu in its 2009-2010 season.\n\nIn a short prologue, the theatre director introduces the work, promising the audience a moral piece on the necessity of having children.\n\nThérèse tires of her life as a submissive woman and becomes the male Tirésias when her breasts turn into balloons and float away. Her husband is not pleased by this, still less so when she ties him up and dresses him as a woman.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of drunken gamblers called Presto and Lacouf affectionately shoot one another and are mourned by the assembled townspeople. Thérèse marches off to conquer the world as General Tiresias, leaving her captive husband to the attentions of the local gendarme, who is fooled by his female attire.\n\nOff-stage, General Tiresias starts a successful campaign against childbirth and is hailed by the populace. Fearful that France will be left sterile if women give up sex, the husband vows to find a way to bear children without women. Lacouf and Presto return from the dead and express both interest and scepticism.\n\nThe curtain rises to cries of \"Papa!\" The husband's project has been a spectacular success, and he has given birth to 40,049 children in a single day. A visiting Parisian journalist asks how he can afford to feed the brood, but the husband explains that the children have all been very successful in careers in the arts, and have made him a rich man with their earnings. After chasing the journalist off, the husband decides to raise a journalist of his own, but is not completely pleased with the results.\n\nThe gendarme now arrives to report that, because of overpopulation, the citizens of Zanzibar are all dying of hunger. The husband suggests getting ration cards printed by a tarot-reading fortune-teller. Just such a fortune-teller immediately appears, looking rather familiar under her mask.\n\nThe fortune-teller prophesies that the fertile husband will be a multi-millionaire, but that the sterile gendarme will die in abject poverty. Incensed, the gendarme attempts to arrest her, but she strangles him and reveals herself as none other than Thérèse. The couple reconcile, and the whole cast gathers at the footlights to urge the audience:\n\n\n"}

The title was also released for Macintosh as well as MSX, Amiga, and MS-DOS. As of March 2018, the series has shipped more than 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe player may choose from four campaign scenarios, including \"Battle for the East\" (beginning in 1560), \"Daimyo Power Struggles\" (1560), \"Ambition Untamed\" (1571), and \"Road Towards Unification\" (1582). In each scenario, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, provide a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty. Gameplay is taken in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season, and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. The player may achieve victory through numerous means, among which are forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.\n\nThe player can make many choices during the campaign. According to Evan Brooks of \"Computer Gaming World\": \"One may transfer soldiers between fiefs, go to war, increase taxes (which causes a decrease in peasant loyalty which may lead to rebellion), transfer rice or gold to another fief, raise the level of flood control (which decreases productivity), make a non-aggression pact or arrange a marriage, cultivate (which increases productivity, but decreases peasant loyalty), use a merchant (to buy/sell rice, borrow funds, or purchase weapons), recruit for the military (soldiers or ninja), train the army (which increases fighting efficiency), spy on a rival, expand a town (which increases taxes collected, but decreases peasant loyalty), give food/rice to peasants/soldiers (to raise morale), steal peasants from rival daimyos, allocate military strength, recuperate (even a daimyo can get sick), turn over a controlled fief to the computer for administration, or pass a turn.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony PlayStation Vita\n\nThese were released in Asia (in traditional Chinese versions ), with physically copies for both versions with and without power up kit, on top of the Japanese versions released.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Nobunaga's Ambition\" series has garnered several awards over the years. According to Koei's website, various releases in the series have won \"Log-In\" magazine's \"BHS Prize\", the \"Minister of Post & Telecommunications Prize\", Nikkei BP's 12th, 13th, and 14th annual \"Best PC Software\" awards, and \"CD-ROM Fan\"'s \"Fan of the Year 2001 Grand Prize\".\n\nIn North America, where it was released five years after its Japanese release, critical reception was also positive. The game was positively reviewed by \"Computer Gaming World\", where reviewer Evan Brooks gave it four stars out of five. He introduced the game as \"a detailed economic / diplomatic / political / military simulation of the unification of Japan in the Sixteenth Century.\" He praised the graphics for being \"among the best that this reviewer has ever seen for the IBM\" and the 5x10 hex map battles, and noted that it used role-playing game elements, including assigning various statistics to a selected persona, a time system where each turn represents a year, as the daimyo ages and eventually dies of old age, and a multiplayer option. He stated that he \"thoroughly enjoyed \"Nobunaga's Ambition\"\", concluded with a \"Highly Recommended\" rating, \"Compute!\" similarly praised the IBM PC version, calling it \"one of the best strategic war games ever designed for a personal computer\" and citing the game play, user interface, and documentation.\n\nThe console versions had a more lukewarm reception. Reviewing the SNES version, \"GamePro\" praised the control interface and combat system but opined that the game essentially offers nothing to set it apart from Koei's previous historical simulators. The magazine rated the Genesis version similarly, saying that \"Like all Koei games, Nobunaga has an easy-to-use but detailed menu-driven interface that activates a load of complex commands.\"\n\nIn 1996, \"Next Generation\" listed the series collectively as number 34 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", commenting that, \"Lead designer Shou Kibasawa is a tactical genius who realizes that domestic and military strategies are interconnected, and that fielding armies can only be accomplished after building an infrastructure to support them. As a result, \"Nobunaga's Ambition\" boasts a level of strategic complexity few other series can come close to matching.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865789", "title": "Hurricane Belle", "text": "Hurricane Belle\n\nHurricane Belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August 1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland.\n\nThreatening much of the East Coast of the United States, hurricane warnings were issued from Georgia to Maine. An estimated 500,000 people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. A total of 12 people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100 million. Portions of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont were later declared major disaster areas by then-President Gerald Ford. Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. An unusually well-organized system for the time of year and location, considerable deep convection accompanied it. A possible low-level circulation consolidated within the system by July 31 as it raced west across the Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the Lesser Antilles in early August, convection separated from the system and moved north of the islands while the wave itself continued into the Caribbean Sea. The northern portion of the system eventually reached a point north of the Bahamas on August 5 and grew increasingly organized. Well-defined upper-level outflow became established that evening. A low-level center formed early on August 6 and became a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC while situated roughly 290 mi (465 km) east-northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. Over the next 24 hours, the system remained almost stationary and executed a small counter-clockwise loop. Early on August 7, the depression acquired gale-force winds and became a tropical storm. Accordingly, it was assigned the name \"Belle\". Acquiring a slow northwest trajectory, Belle steadily intensified on August 7. Reconnaissance aircraft investigating the storm revealed the system to have achieved hurricane strength by 18:00 UTC as its pressure fell to 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Additionally, a well-defined eye was present by this time.\nThe cyclone turned northward and accelerated on August 8 while reaching major hurricane status that evening. Early on August 9, Belle achieved its peak intensity with maximum estimated surface winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 957 mb (hPa; 28.26 inHg). At higher altitudes within the storm, recon reported winds up to 150 mph (240 km/h). Turning to just east of due north, Belle began weakening shortly thereafter with its eye becoming obscured. Late on August 9, the hurricane passed within 60 mi (95 km) of Hatteras Island, North Carolina. Contrary to most storms which threaten the northeastern states, Belle did not accelerate tremendously as it neared land. Accordingly, it weakened quickly in response to cooler waters in the region. Around 05:00 UTC on August 10, Belle made landfall as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds along Jones Beach, Long Island, New York. Briefly crossing the Long Island Sound, Belle made a second landfall as a strong tropical storm near Bridgeport, Connecticut. Once inland over New England, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while traversing New Hampshire. The remnants accelerated northeast and later due east across Atlantic Canada before emerging over the Labrador Sea on August 12. While situated between the Azores and Greenland, ex-Belle turned north-northeast and ultimately dissipated south of Iceland on August 15.\n\nOwing to Hurricane Belle's proximity to many states along the Eastern Seaboard, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for the entire coast from Georgia to Maine. Accordingly, evacuations took place in numerous states with an estimated 500,000 people evacuating overall.\n\nOfficials advised residents near the coastline to evacuate to safer areas further inland. Approximately 40,000 vacationing in the Outer Banks evacuated; however, roughly 2,500 residents decided to ride out the storm in their homes. In Kitty Hawk and Nags Head, volunteer firefighters traveled door-to-door urging residents to leave. Schools and hotels across the areas were utilized as shelters for tourists. National Parks across the Outer Banks closed for the duration of the storm. Aircraft at the Marine Corps Camp Lejeune were relocated inland and helicopters were moved to hangars; some helicopters remained available for emergency rescue operations. An estimated 6,200 residents evacuated to Red Cross shelters in the state.\n\nThe majority of evacuations in the country were in New Jersey, with 250,000 residents and tourists relocating. Of this total, 65,000 were from Long Beach Island and 12,000 on the Barnegat Peninsula. With Hurricane Belle expected to make landfall around high tide and a full moon, the forecast storm tide in rivaled that of Hurricane Donna in 1960. This placed roughly 500,000 people in danger and officials in New York immediately began preparations. Police officers handed out sandbags to residents in low-lying areas and National Guard armories and some public schools were used as evacuation centers. Approximately 30,000 evacuated in New York City and Suffolk County, 11,000 of whom utilized the aforementioned shelters. In Staten Island, 225 patients in a local hospital were relocated to a second facility. A flood watch was issued for the Hudson Valley in southern New York ahead of the hurricane on August 8. Advisories from the National Hurricane Center emphasized the flood risk as well. Numerous flights in and out of New York were cancelled, Wall Street was closed, and the United Nations postponed a meeting. Summer tourists evacuated from most beaches but many residents decided to stay. In Connecticut, 52 helicopters and 100 pilots from the National Guard were placed on standby for possible relief missions following the storm.\n\nFarther north in Rhode Island, 10,000 people fled from the coast. Despite evacuation orders, nearly half of the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70 flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.\n\nAcross the Eastern United States, the effects of Belle were less than anticipated. A total of 12 people lost their lives, mostly due to traffic accidents, and damage amounted to $100 million.\n\nHurricane Belle produced a swath of light to moderate, and locally heavy, rain extending from North Carolina into New England. The highest totals were confined to areas closer to the storm's center, with accumulations of common along its track. Notable state maximums included in Massachusetts, in Maryland, in Maine, in New York, in New Jersey, in Connecticut, and in Virginia. Although on the weaker side of the storm, New Jersey saw the highest winds from Belle, with an estimated peak gust of 90 mph (150 km/h) in Ship Bottom. A similar gust was estimated to have occurred in Jones Beach, New York, where Belle made landfall. Hurricane-force gusts also affected portions of Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina. LaGuardia Airport, near New York City, saw sustained winds of with gusts to , while Bridgeport, Connecticut has gusts to 77 mph. Tides of above normal were common from North Carolina to Rhode Island. Atlantic City, New Jersey saw the greatest tides at above mean low-tide, while Battery Park in lower Manhattan saw a peak value of above mean low tide.\n\nNorth Carolina escaped relatively unscathed from the hurricane, with only a few reports of wind damage in the Outer Banks. Windows at a hotel in Nags Head were blown out. Along the North Carolina–Virginia border, five people lost their lives in a car accident on a rain-slicked highway. Minor damage took place in Maryland. Although on the weaker side of the storm, gusty winds knocked down numerous power lines in New Jersey, leaving 10,000 people in the dark and setting off 75 fire alarms, one of which was a relatively large fire forcing the evacuation of a nursing home. Roughly of the Atlantic City boardwalk was damaged or destroyed, with repairs estimated to reach $5 million. Damage to properties in Monmouth and Ocean counties amounted to $3.6 million and $1 million, respectively. On August 21, then-President Gerald Ford issued a major disaster declaration for Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, and Ocean counties, allowing them to receive federal funding.\n\nThe high winds knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000 residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania were called in to assist in restoring electricity. Damage across the island reached $8 million, of which $3 million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000 residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000 people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1 million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August 14.\n\nOwing to heavy rains that preceded the hurricane, widespread small stream flooding took place in New England, particularly in Vermont where then-governor Thomas P. Salmon declared a state of emergency. Flooding in the state was reported as the worst in 30 years, with southern areas of the state seeing the greatest damage. Hardest hit was the town of Chester where 35 of its 85 roads flooded and 5 bridges were washed out. Otter Creek crested at above flood stage. Significant damage also took place in Jamaica, Ludlow, and Londonderry. Two people died in Huntington after the footbridge they were crossing collapsed into the Huntington River. Portions of Route 100 were washed out. Property damage in the state reached $5–10 million. The overall scale of flooding was regarded as a 1-in-10 to 1-in-25 year event. Immediately following the hurricane, a statewide ban on drinking water was imposed with an order to boil it first. This was later lifted on August 23. Salt accumulation along power lines in Rhode Island cut electricity to 8,000 residents on Aquidneck Island. Along the Saint John River in Aroostook County, Maine, flooding caused $2.5 million worth of damage to crops and buildings.\n\nHeavy rains across New Brunswick, Canada, amounting to in Edundston, triggered flooding that damaged crops, homes, and roads. Losses from the event were estimated to be at least $1 million.\n\n"}

Smith\n\nMichael Earl Smith (born August 10, 1965) is an American jockey who has been one of the leading riders in U.S. Thoroughbred racing since the early 1990s, was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2003, and has won the most Breeders' Cup races of any jockey with 26 Breeders' Cup wins. Smith is also the second leading jockey of all time in earnings with over $312 million. In 2018, Smith rode Justify to the Triple Crown, becoming the oldest jockey to win the title at age 52.\n\nSmith was born to George Smith, a one-time jockey, and Vidoll Vallejos in New Mexico; his mother was 19 years old at the time. The older of two sons, Smith's parents divorced when he was still a small child. Smith spent most of his youth on his maternal grandparents' horse farm where he began breaking horses at eight years old.\n\nSmith began riding races in his native New Mexico at age 11, and took out a jockey's license at age 16 in 1982. In the ninth grade, Smith dropped out of Dexter High School. Shortly thereafter, accompanied by his paternal grandfather, he began riding a Midwestern circuit which included races at Hawthorne Race Course in Chicago, Ak-Sar-Ben in Omaha and Oaklawn Park Race Track in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\n\nOn April 17, 1987, Smith married Patrice Lively, daughter of jockey John L. Lively, in Hot Springs. The marriage ended in divorce.\n\nSmith served his apprenticeship at Canterbury Downs in Minnesota before moving to New York in 1989. In 2000, he established his home base in Southern California.\n\nOn January 13, 2019 Mike married Cynthia Naanouh at a private ceremony at St. Rita's Catholic Church in Sierra Madre, California.\n\nIn 1991, Smith became one of the few American jockeys to win a European classic by claiming victory in the Irish 2,000 Guineas aboard Fourstars Allstar (some other American jockeys, notably Steve Cauthen and Cash Asmussen, had won European classics before Smith, but were based in Europe). Also that year he got his big break by becoming leading jockey in New York for the first of three years from 1991 to 1993, with 330, 297 and 313 wins, respectively. The following year, he rode his first Breeders' Cup winner, Lure, in the Breeders' Cup Mile.\n\nThe year after that, 1993, Smith truly arrived as a top jockey, setting a North American record for stakes wins in a year with 62. Among his highlights were a win in the Preakness aboard Prairie Bayou- who was later euthanized after breaking down in the Belmont Stakes while being ridden by Smith – and a successful defense of the Breeders' Cup Mile aboard Lure. That year, he won his first Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey, and also won an ESPY Award as top jockey. In 1994, he broke his own record for stakes wins with 68, 20 of them Grade I races. Several of those wins came while riding that year's Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner, Holy Bull. He also rode two winners in that year's Breeders' Cup, and again won the Eclipse Award as leading jockey. Smith went on to ride two Breeders' Cup winners in both 1995 and 1997.\n\nIn 1994, he was voted the Mike Venezia Memorial Award for \"extraordinary sportsmanship and citizenship\".\n\nThe dangers of Smith's profession became evident in 1998, when he suffered major injuries in two separate spills. A broken shoulder in March took him out of action for two months. Then, in August, while leading the Saratoga meeting, he broke two vertebrae in his back, requiring him to wear a body cast for several months. He came back six months after the fall.\n\nIn 2000, he moved his home base from New York to Southern California. That year he won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award that honors a rider whose career and personal conduct exemplify the very best example of participants in the sport of thoroughbred racing. In 2002, he served as the regular rider for his second Horse of the Year, Azeri. He rode Azeri to a win in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, and also rode Vindication to a win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.\n\nIn 2005, he rode 50–1 longshot Giacomo to victory in the Kentucky Derby. The win, Smith's first in the Derby, was something of a vindication for him. He was aboard Giacomo's sire Holy Bull, the 2–1 favorite in the 1994 Derby, but could finish only 12th after Holy Bull was bumped coming out of the starting gate.\n\nIn 2008, he added two more Breeders' Cup victories first in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies with Stardom Bound, and with the then 4-year-old Zenyatta in the Ladies' Classic. A year later, Smith returned to the Breeders' Cup with Zenyatta, this time to capture the Breeders' Cup Classic. Smith partnered Zenyatta to 16 straight victories of a 19-for-20 career that saw her become the first horse to win two different Breeders' Cup races, and the richest female racehorse with the earnings of $7,304,580.\n\nAfter capturing the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic on Royal Delta in 2011, Smith became the all-time leader for most Breeders' Cup wins, with 17. By 2016, his record rose to 25 Breeders' Cup wins. \n\nSmith was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2003. Smith is one of the jockeys featured in Animal Planet's 2009 reality documentary, \"Jockeys\".\n\nMike Smith earned the 5,000th victory of his Hall of Fame career when he teamed with 2011 sprint champion Amazombie to capture the $150,000 Potrero Grande Stakes (gr. II) at Santa Anita Park on April 7, 2012.\n\nAs he became older, Smith chose to ride fewer but more lucrative races, and his success in doing so, particularly his ability to stay calm in the most high-pressure races, earned him the nickname \"Big Money Mike\". In 2017, Smith became the 14th winner of the Laffit Pincay Jr. Award given by the Hall of Fame jockey it is named for. Recipients are given the award for having served the sport of horse racing \"with integrity, extraordinary dedication, determination, and distinction.\" \"When we started this award back in 2004, Mike Smith was absolutely the sort of person we had in mind as one of our winners,\" Pincay said. \"I only got to ride against him briefly out here, but I've followed his career over the years and he's been a model of consistency, class, and pure athletic ability. He's a star in all senses of the word and it is an honor to honor him.\"\n\nIn 2018, Smith became the rider of Justify, who, after winning two races with the horse in California, won the 2018 Kentucky Derby. In doing so, the horse broke the 136-year-old \"curse of Apollo\" by winning the Kentucky Derby without having raced at 2 years of age. The last time this feat was accomplished was by Apollo in the 1882 race.\n\nTwo weeks later, Justify and Smith won the 2018 Preakness Stakes and then, on June 9th, 2018, at the 150th Belmont Stakes, Justify, ridden by Smith, became the 13th Triple Crown winner. In doing so, Smith, at age 52, became the oldest jockey to win a Triple Crown.\n\nOn December 28th, 2019, Mike Smith surpassed Jerry Bailey for most grade 1 wins by a jockey with 217 wins.\n\n"}
{"id": "1865807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865807", "title": "Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)", "text": "Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)\n\nThe Symphony No. 5 in E minor, Op. 64 by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was composed between May and August 1888 and was first performed in St Petersburg at the Mariinsky Theatre on November 17 of that year with Tchaikovsky conducting. It is dedicated to Theodor Avé-Lallemant.\n\nIn the first ten years after graduating from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1865 Tchaikovsky completed three symphonies. After that he started five more symphony projects, four of which led to a completed symphony premiered during the composer's lifetime.\n\nThe fifth symphony was composed in 1888, between the \"Manfred\" Symphony of 1885 and the sketches for a Symphony in E, which were abandoned in 1892 (apart from recuperating material from its first movement for an \"Allegro Brillante\" for piano and orchestra a year later). As for the numbered symphonies, Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 was composed between Symphony No. 4, which had been completed ten years earlier, and Symphony No. 6, composed 5 years later, in the year of the composer's death.\n\nUnlike its two predecessors, Symphony No. 5 has no clear program. On 15 April 1888, about a month before he began composing the symphony, the composer sketched a scenario for its first movement in his notebook, containing \"... a complete resignation before fate, which is the same as the inscrutable predestination of fate ...\" It is however uncertain how much of this program has been realised in the composition.\n\nLike the Symphony No. 4, No. 5 is a cyclical symphony, with a recurring main theme. Unlike No. 4, however, the theme is heard in all four movements, a feature Tchaikovsky had first used in the Manfred Symphony, which was completed less than three years before No. 5.\n\nThe work is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.\n\nThe Symphony is in four movements:\n\nThe symphony displays an overall tonal trajectory of E minor to E major. The first movement ends in the minor mode, which allows the narrative to continue through the rest of the symphony:\n\nThe recurring main theme is used as a device to unify the four movements of the symphony. This motto theme, sometimes dubbed \"Fate theme\", has a funereal character in the first movement, but gradually transforms into a triumphant march, which dominates the final movement.\n\nA typical performance of the symphony lasts somewhat less than 50 minutes.\n\nMotto Theme, mm. 1–4:\n</score>\n\nPrimary Theme 1 (PT1), mm. 42–50:\n</score>\n\nPrimary Theme 2 (PT2), mm. 116–128:\n</score>\n\nSubordinate Theme (ST), mm. 170–182:\n</score>\n\nMotive X, mm.154–170:\n</score>\n\nIn the exposition of the first movement, the initial tonality (E minor) is relatively unstable. A D major tonality slips in and out E minor as V of the relative major (G major), but not until mm. 128–132 does one hear this as an antagonistic to E minor. The exposition concludes in D major after integrating part of the PT1 into its cadential moment (mm. 194–198). Motive X frames the secondary theme group by preceding the ST and reiterating D major afterwards.\n\nThe development consists of four distinct sections. The first section exhibits a sequence based on the PT1 superimposed with motive X. This is accompanied by a bass line that diatonically descends over an octave and a fifth. The second section develops the head motive from PT1. The shifting meter (from to ), and diminished sonority (m. 261 for example) adds to growing instability. The third section is a brief allusion to the PT2, interrupted by a fugato based on PT1. Motive X returns strongly and insistently in m. 285, going back and forth between G minor and D minor. This can be interpreted as an effort to re-establish sonority in D. The re-transition to recapitulation is rather abrupt, yet a clever use of common tone modulation can be observed.\n\nThe recapitulation of this movement follows the convention of sonata form.\n\nThe second movement begins with the continuation of the tragic sonority in B minor, as if the movement will be in the minor dominant of the tonic of the symphony. Instead, a common chord modulation leads to a D major theme first introduced by a solo horn.\n</score>\nTheme A1 (1st horn):\n</score>\n\nTheme A2 (oboe/horn):\n</score>\n\nTheme B (clarinet in A):\n</score>\n\nThis movement is in a standard ternary form with the A section in D major, the B section alluding to F minor, then a restatement of the A section with different orchestration. Compared to the stable A section, the B section exhibits instability in many ways. For example, the theme begins and remains in V of F minor, even though it could be easily resolved to F minor. Moreover, the segmentation of a theme, fugato texture, and rapid shift of hyper meter contributes to the instability of this section.\n\nIn this movement, the motto theme appears twice: from mm. 99–103 as a structural dominant preparing the return of the A section, and in the coda (mm. 158–166) in G. One could interpret this as a preparation for I, but also as a structural leading tone to the next movement (G → A), especially since the unwinding from the climactic restatement of the motto theme occurs relatively hesitantly and what follows seems to diminish away.\n\nWaltz 1:\n</score>\nWaltz 2 (ob 1):\n</score>\nWaltz 3:\n</score>\nTrio:\n</score>\nThe third movement is a waltz, with some unusual elements, for example, hemiola and unbalanced phrase structure at the outset of the movement. These elements take over the movement in the trio section, which is a scherzo. The scherzo theme initially played by the first violins can be seen as a superimposition of over . Hemiola is used again as a transitional technique (mm. 97–105). The waltz returns, but with the texture from the scherzo.\n\nThe return of the motto theme in the third movement, preceded by a waltz in a major mode, recalls the opening of the symphony, but with a hemiola element:\n</score>\n\nIntroduction – Motto Theme:\n</score>\n\nPT1 (violin I):\n</score>\nPT2:\n</score>\n</score>\n\nST:\n</score>\n\nThe exposition of the last movement begins in E minor, whilst the D major sonority seeks to establish itself. Unlike the first movement, there is an early statement in D major, as well as in V of D major (mm. 86–90, 106–114). A passage of key oppositions, increasing harmonic rhythm, segmentation, and rapid changes of themes culminates at m. 172 with the re-introduction of the motto theme in C major.\n</score>\n\nThe development is very brief, lasting about 60 measures. In the recapitulation, a new melody is superimposed over the texture, but never returns.\n\nThe sixth statement of the motto theme is in E minor, leading to an emphatic Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) in B major. Following this, the coda succeeds in reemphasizing the tonic, using different themes and many cadences in the tonic. Some of the themes used here are the motto theme (m. 474), the countermelody to PT1 (m. 474, superimposed onto the motto theme), PT2 (m. 504), and PT1 from the first movement of the symphony.\n</score>\n\nSome critics, including Tchaikovsky himself, have considered the ending insincere or even crude. After the second performance, Tchaikovsky wrote, \"I have come to the conclusion that it is a failure\". Despite this, the symphony has gone on to become one of the composer's most popular works. The second movement, in particular, is considered to be classic Tchaikovsky: well crafted, colorfully orchestrated, and with a memorable melody for solo horn. The melody, however, was not conceived by Tchaikovsky on his own but taken from the third movement of Joachim Raff's Symphony No. 10 \"Zur Herbstzeit\", which had been written 7 years earlier.\n\nPossibly for its very clear exposition of the idea of \"ultimate victory through strife\", the Fifth was very popular during World War II, with many new recordings of the work, and many performances during those years. One of the most notable performances was by the Leningrad Radio Orchestra during the Siege of Leningrad. City leaders had ordered the orchestra to continue its performances to keep the spirits high in the city. On the night of October 20, 1941 they played Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 at the city's Philharmonic Hall and it was broadcast live to London. As the second movement began, bombs started to fall nearby, but the orchestra continued playing until the final note. Since the war it has remained very popular, but has been somewhat eclipsed in popularity by the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies.\n\nCritical reaction to the work was mixed, with some enthusiasm in Russia. Berezovsky wrote, \"The Fifth Symphony is the weakest of Tchaikovsky's symphonies, but nevertheless it is a striking work, taking a prominent place not only among the composer's output but among Russian works in general. ... the entire symphony seems to spring from some dark spiritual experience.\"\n\nOn the symphony's first performance in the United States, critical reaction, especially in Boston, was almost unanimously hostile. A reviewer for the Boston \"Evening Transcript\", October 24, 1892, wrote:\n\nOf the Fifth Tchaikovsky Symphony one hardly knows what to say ... In the Finale we have all the untamed fury of the Cossack, whetting itself for deeds of atrocity, against all the sterility of the Russian steppes. The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium, delirium tremens, raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!\n\nThe reception in New York was little better. A reviewer for the \"Musical Courier\", March 13, 1889, wrote:\n\nIn the Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony ... one vainly sought for coherency and homogeneousness ... in the last movement, the composer's Calmuck blood got the better of him, and slaughter, dire and bloody, swept across the storm-driven score.\n\n‘Farewell, Amanda’, written by Cole Porter for the 1949 Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn film Adam's Rib, draws liberally from the 4th movement of Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony.\n\nIt is alleged that a fragment of the \"fate\" theme is quoted by Dmitri Shostakovich in his Symphony No. 7 in the \"invasion\" theme of the first movement.\n\nPart of the second movement was given English lyrics under the title \"Moon Love\".\n\nThe beginning of \"Annie's Song\" by John Denver is almost identical to the first horn theme in the second movement, but it seems this was unintentional and only pointed out to Denver by his producer Milt Okun.\n\nAn arrangement of the second movement was used in a prominent 1970s Australian advertisement for Winfield cigarettes.\n\n"}

He is known for making the first transcontinental jet flight in U.S. history and for his service as CEO and chairman of Pan American World Airways from 1969 to 1972.\n\nHalaby was born in Dallas, Texas. His father was Najeeb Elias Halaby, Sr. (March 17, 1878/1880 – December 16, 1928), a Syrian Christian Halaby's paternal grandfather was Elias Halaby, a provincial treasurer or magistrate in Ottoman Syria, who also came to the U.S. in 1891. \n\nHalaby's father worked as an importer, and later as an oil broker; in the mid-1920s he opened Halaby Galleries, a rug boutique and interior-decorating shop, at Neiman Marcus in Dallas, and ran it with his American wife, Halaby's mother, the former Laura Wilkins (April 23, 1889 – April 1987). He died shortly afterward, and his estate was unable to continue the new enterprise. Following Halaby's father's death, Laura Halaby married Urban B. Koen, but they ultimately divorced. Halaby's maternal grandfather was John Thomas Wilkins, who served in the 7th Tennessee Cavalry during the Civil War.\n\nHalaby was a graduate of The Leelanau School, a boarding school in Glen Arbor Township Leelanau County, Michigan, and is enshrined in that school's Hall of Fame. An alumnus of Stanford University (1937) and Yale Law School (1940), he served as a U.S. Navy test pilot in World War II. On May 1, 1945, Halaby made history by making the first transcontinental jet flight in U.S. history. Halaby took off from Muroc AFB, California, and landed at Patuxent River NAS, Maryland, 5 hours and 40 minutes later.\n\nAfter the war he served as the U.S. State Department's civil aviation advisor to King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, helping the king develop Saudi Arabian Airlines. Next, he worked as an aide to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in the late 1940s, then helped Paul Nitze write NSC 68. He joined Laurance Rockefeller's family office in 1953, reviewing investments in civil aviation.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, he served as the second Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) – the future Federal Aviation Administration – appointed by President John F. Kennedy. Halaby was a proponent for the creation of the United States Department of Transportation, which occurred in April 1967 during his time in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While Halaby was the director of the FAA, he also was the lead proponent of the Boeing 2707 Supersonic Jet. President Johnson signed executive order 11149 approving $1 Billion to build a US made SSJ, but eventually the project was cancelled in 1971 because of its cost. \n\nFrom 1969 to 1972, he served as CEO, and chairman after 1970, of Pan American World Airways. As Pan American World Airways chairman, he was present at the christening of the first Boeing 747 aircraft.\n\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Halaby was meeting with President Nixon on November 24, 1971. Three hours later the same day, D.B. Cooper hijacked flight 305 from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington. In his memoir book, he mentions two hijackings, however, he does not mention the D.B. Cooper hijacking nor does he mention that he was meeting with the President of the United States just hour prior to the hijacking.\n\nHalaby was married three times. He married Doris Carlquist in Washington, D.C., on December 24, 1945 and he divorced her in 1977. They had three children: daughter Lisa, who became Queen of Jordan in 1978; son Christian; and daughter Alexa.\n\nHe was married to the former Jane Allison Coates from 1980 until her death in 1996. From 1997 until his death in 2003 at age 87, he was married to Libby Anderson Cater.\n"}

{"id": "1865828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865828", "title": "BitTorrent tracker", "text": "BitTorrent tracker\n\nA BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol. \n\nIn peer-to-peer file sharing, a software client on an end-user PC requests a file, and portions of the requested file residing on peer machines are sent to the client, and then reassembled into a full copy of the requested file. The \"tracker\" server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines, which ones are available at time of the client request, and helps coordinate efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file. Clients that have already begun downloading a file communicate with the tracker periodically to negotiate faster file transfer with new peers, and provide network performance statistics; however, after the initial peer-to-peer file download is started, peer-to-peer communication can continue without the connection to a tracker. \n\nSince the creation of the distributed hash table (DHT) method for \"trackerless\" torrents, BitTorrent trackers have largely become redundant; however, they are still often included with torrents to improve the speed of peer discovery.\n\nPublic or open trackers can be used by anyone by adding the tracker address to an existing torrent, or they can be used by any newly created torrent, like OpenBitTorrent. The Pirate Bay operated one of the most popular public trackers until disabling it in 2009 due to legal trouble, and thereafter offered only magnet links.\n\nA \"private tracker\" is a BitTorrent tracker that restricts use by requiring users to register with the site. The method for controlling registration used among many private trackers is an invitation system, in which active and contributing members are given the ability to grant a new user permission to register at the site, or a new user goes through an interview process.\n\nThere are several circumstances under which it is legal to distribute copyrighted material or parts thereof.\n\n\nThere are also experiments at legally selling content that is distributed over BitTorrent using a \"secure\" tracker system.\n\nTrackers are the primary reason for a damaged BitTorrent \"swarm\". (Other reasons are mostly related to damaged or hacked clients uploading corrupt data.) The reliability of trackers has been improved through two main innovations in the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nMulti-tracker torrents contain multiple trackers in a single torrent file. This provides redundancy in the case that one tracker fails, the other trackers can continue to maintain the swarm for the torrent. One disadvantage to this is that it becomes possible to have multiple unconnected swarms for a single torrent where some users can connect to one specific tracker while being unable to connect to another. This can create a disjoint set which can impede the efficiency of a torrent to transfer the files it describes. Additional extensions such as Peer exchange and DHT mitigate this effect by rapidly merging otherwise disjoint graphs of peers.\n\nVuze (formerly Azureus) was the first BitTorrent client to implement such a system through the distributed hash table (DHT) method. An alternative and incompatible DHT system, known as Mainline DHT, was developed simultaneously and later adopted by the BitTorrent (Mainline), μTorrent, Transmission, rTorrent, KTorrent, BitComet, and Deluge clients.\n\nCurrent versions of the official BitTorrent client, μTorrent, BitComet, Transmission and BitSpirit all share compatibility with Mainline DHT. Both DHT implementations are based on Kademlia. As of version 3.0.5.0, Vuze also supports Mainline DHT in addition to its own distributed database through use of an optional application plugin [MainlineDHT Plugin]. This potentially allows the Vuze client to reach a bigger swarm.\n\nMost BitTorrent clients also use Peer exchange (PeX) to gather peers in addition to trackers and DHT.

It is the second in the \"Simon the Sorcerer\" series of games.\n\nThe Evil wizard Sordid is brought back to life when a magic-book of his is set ablaze and thrown into the middle of a chalkboard pentagram by the father of Runt, a young boy wanting to become a mighty sorcerer. Sordid promises him that he can become his apprentice if he helps him exact his vengeance on Simon.\n\nSeveral months later, Sordid's Fortress of Doom is reconstructed and Sordid has a new robotic body. He sends a magical wardrobe to fetch Simon but it accidentally ends up on the doorstep of Calypso, the wizard Simon had to save in the last game. Simon then starts to look for a fuel called \"mucusade\" which he needs to power the wardrobe in order to get home.\n\nDrafts for the plot had been in the works since August 1993, shortly before the first game was released. Simon Woodroffe wrote the entire story, going over the details for quite some time. The screens were sketched, lined and then colored in.\n\nThe PC sequel was released in a large black box and, like the original, the copy-protected floppy disk version required the manual to be able to play the game. Unlike the disk version, the CD-ROM was not copy-protected, its colour manual fit in the front of the jewel case and also included the full \"talkie\" soundtrack. For this second installment in the series, Brian Bowles became the voice of Simon, making him sound much older, presumably in his late-teens.\n\nThe Amiga version was originally scheduled for release alongside the PC version in 1995, but was cancelled, possibly because of the decline of the Amiga market. The rights for the Amiga release were eventually secured by Epic Interactive Entertainment (now RuneSoft) in 1999, who released it on CD in July 2000 in a DVD-style case.\n\nThe game was released on GOG.com in 2008 and a port for iOS was released in 2009 and discontinued mid-2015, due to lack of iOS 8 and up support.\n\nThe 25th Anniversary Edition was developed by MojoTouch and released on Google Play and Amazon Appstore. in 2013 (then called \"20th Anniversary Edition\") and on the App Store (iOS), Steam and GOG.com in 2018.

The current dam was built in the 1980s and is close to the ruins of the Great Dam of Ma'rib built in the 8th century BC. It was one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world and a central part of the Sabaean and Himyarite kingdoms around Ma'rib.\n\nThere are also other important ancient dams in Yemen such as the Dam of Jufaynah, the Dam of Khārid, the Dam of Aḑra’ah, the Dam of Miqrān and the Dam of Yath’ān. Historically, Yemen has been recognized for the magnificence of its ancient water engineering. From the Red Sea coast to the limits of the Rub' al Khali desert are numerous ruins of small and large dams made of earth and stone.\n\nThe site of the great Dam of Ma'rib, also called the Dam of 'Arim (, \"\"), is upstream (south-west) of the ancient city of Ma'rib, once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Saba’ (, possibly Sheba). The Kingdom of Saba' was a prosperous trading nation, with control of the frankincense and spice routes in Arabia and Abyssinia. The Sabaeans built the dam to capture the periodic monsoon rains which fall on the nearby mountains and so irrigate the land around the city.\n\nRecent archaeological findings suggest that simple earth dams and a canal network were constructed as far back as 2000 BC. The Great Dam of Ma'rib dates back to about the 8th century BC and is counted by some as one of the most wonderful feats of engineering in the ancient world.\n\nThe medieval Arab geographer Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī describes it thus:\nIt is between three mountains, and the flood waters all flow to the one location, and because of that the water only discharges in one direction; and the ancients blocked that place with hard rocks and lead. The water from springs gathers there as well as floodwater, collecting behind the dam like a sea. Whenever they wanted to they could irrigate their crops from it, by just letting out however much water they needed from sluice gates; once they had used enough they would close the gates again as they pleased.\n\nThe historical dam was severely damaged by a Saudi airstrike in the night of May 31, 2015.\n\nThe date of the first construction of a dam at Ma’rib goes back to somewhere between 1750 and 1700 BC. The earliest inscription on the dam is one placed there at the time of its construction or repair of parts of the dam undertaken by Yatha' Amar Watar I, son of Yada' El Zarih I, who reigned in 760–740 BC. The following repair was in the time of Yada' El Bayin II who reigned in 740–720 BC. Renovations were then carried out by Dhamar El Zarih I and Karab El Bayin who reigned in 700–680 BC. All repairs were minor, consisting of essential maintenance, such as removing dirt, or opening water courses, or stopping up gaps. The Makrib Samah' El Yanuf II, son of Dhamar El Watar II, had his name carved into parts of the dam to mark the completion and repair of the dam.\n\nThe dam was composed of packed earth, triangular in cross section, 580 m in length and 4 meters high. It ran between two groups of rocks on either side of the river and was linked to the rock with substantial stonework. The dam's position allowed for a spillway and sluices between the northern end of the dam and the cliffs to the west. Around 500 BC the dam height was increased to 7 meters, the upstream slope (the water face) was reinforced with a cover of stones, and irrigation was extended to include the southern side as well as the northern side.\n\nAfter the end of the Kingdom of Saba', the dam fell under the control of the Ḥimyarites around 115 BC. They undertook further reconstruction, creating a structure 14 meters high with extensive waterworks at both the northern and southern ends, five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a settling pond, and a 1000-meter canal to a distribution tank. These extensive works were not actually finalized until 325 AD and allowed the irrigation of .\n\nThe Muslim historian al-Isfahānī (whose \"Annals\" were completed in 961 CE) maintains that the famous breach of the dam occurred some four hundred years before the rise of Islam, but Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī assigns it to the time of Abyssinian rule.\n\nAncient South Arabian sources report that in about 145 BC, the dam suffered a major breach during the war between the people of Raydān and the Kingdom of Saba’, and that is the very breach that many scholars consider to have caused the \"Sayl al-ˁArim\" (, Flood of the ‘Arim) mentioned in the Quran; it is also mentioned in Arab proverbs which speak about the \"hands of Saba\"' having separated at that time. The fighting between the Raydānites and the Sabaeans delayed the repair of the dam, and this caused devastating losses of crops and fruit, leading large numbers of people to disperse in search of new land capable of supporting life, so huge migrations ensued. It is still uncertain though whether it was that particular breach that caused the \"flood of ˁArim\" or not, since some migrations certainly took place in the 2nd or 3rd centuries CE, and they are also ascribed to the breaking of the Dam of Ma’rib. Generally speaking, the dam was repaired twice shortly before the coming of Islam, once by Sharḥabīl Yaˁfar bin Abī Karab Yasˁad in 450 , and by Abrahah in 543. The inscriptions on the dam explain the costs of repair and the large number of workers involved.\n\nThe archaeology of the Ma'rib Dam shows the effects of siltation behind dams in antiquity, and measures to extend the operational life of the reservoir. The same problems of siltation encountered in the ancient dam was also faced in the construction of the new dam.\n\nDespite the increases in height, the dam suffered numerous breaches (recorded major incidents occurred in 449, 450, 542 and 548) and the maintenance work became increasingly onerous; the last recorded repairs took place in 557.\n\nLocal tales report that the final breach of the dam had been predicted by a king called ‘Imrān, who was also a soothsayer, and later by the wife of the king. According to legend, the breach was caused by large rats gnawing at it with their teeth and scratching it with their nails. In 570 or 575, the dam was again overtopped, and this time left unrepaired. The breaching and destruction of the Dam of Ma’rib was a historical event, and was alluded to in the Quran:\n\nThe consequent failure of the irrigation system provoked the migration of up to 50,000 people from Yemen to other areas of the Arabian Peninsula, and even to the Levant.\n\nA new dam was built in the 1980s, close to the location of the old one, at the expense of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late President of the United Arab Emirates, whose tribe reportedly resettled from Ma'rib to what is now the United Arab Emirates, some time during the 17th century, or in the 6th century, after the collapse of the historical dam. The opening ceremony took place in 1986, in the presence of Sheikh Zayed. The dam was considered by people inside and outside Yemen to have a positive effect on the agriculture and economy of the region of Ma'rib, and the country in general.\n\nThe new dam is high, long, built of earth across the Wadi Dhana at , creating a storage capacity of 398 million cubic meters. The dam site is located upstream of the ruins of the Great Dam. The new dam, like the old, was designed to store water for irrigating the Ma'rib plains. However, the wadi bed at the new dam site consists of alluvial sand and gravel material 30–50 m thick. Seepage that emanates from this dam does not threaten its structure, but results in the loss of water. As a way of capturing the seepage, consideration is being given to rebuilding the ancient Ma'rib dam, both as a functioning structure, and also as a historic monument and tourist attraction. The complexity and volume of work involved in this project make it necessary that several organizations work together under the aegis of UNESCO, using financial contributions from international organizations.\n\nNewly constructed dams in Yemen, such as Batis Dam and Ma'rib, are used to collect water for the population. A newspaper wrote in July 2010: \"The water level in the Ma'rib Dam has risen to 45 million cubic meters as a result of the heavy rainfall in various areas of Yemen in the past two days. Under-Secretary of Ma'rib Governorate, Ali Muhammad al-Fatimid, was briefed Tuesday on the amount of water flowing into the dam and the maintenance of drainage channels and sub systems. The Deputy Director of the Ma'rib Dam Project, Engineer Ahmed al-Arifi, said the water level in the dam on Tuesday rose to 45 million cubic meters, while the water level last April rose to 100 million cubic meters. The gate of the main channel for groundwater was opened in the valley of Ubaida for three months, where the quantity of water flowing amounted to 80 million cubic meters.\"\nThe dam was damaged in an airstrike in 2015. Yemeni officials said that Saudi Arabian coalition forces were responsible for the airstrike.\n\n\n"}

These worms ingest sediments, selectively digest bacteria, and absorb molecules through their body walls. \nMicro-plastic ingestion by Tubifex worms acts a significant risk for trophic transfer and biomagnification of microplastics up the aquatic food chain. The worms can survive with little oxygen by waving hemoglobin-rich tail ends to exploit all available oxygen, and can exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen through their thin skins, in a manner similar to frogs. They can also survive in areas heavily polluted with organic matter that almost no other species can endure. By forming a protective cyst and lowering its metabolic rate, \"T. tubifex\" can survive drought and food shortage. Encystment may also function in the dispersal of the worm.\nThey usually inhabit the bottom sediments of lakes, rivers, and occasionally sewer lines and outlets.\n"}

There were numerous random attacks on revelers over a period of about three and a half hours. There were reports of widespread brawling, vandalism, and weapons being brandished. Damage to local businesses exceeded $100,000. About 70 people were reported injured. Several women were sexually assaulted. One man, Kris Kime, died of injuries sustained during an attempt to assist a woman being brutalized.\n\nIt was Seattle's second serious rioting incident in three years, the first being the 1999 World Trade Organization's Minister Level Conference On World Free Trade. Large crowds and some disturbances occurred during Mardi Gras leading up to the events of Fat Tuesday. The police department's lack of intervention during the disturbance led to allegations of police misconduct. Responses during and after the event by both the Mayor and Chief of Police were met with intense scrutiny. The violence led to a moratorium on large Mardi Gras celebrations in the city and tarnished the neighborhood's reputation.\n\nPioneer Square was often described as the center of Seattle's nightlife at the time with its numerous bars and clubs. The neighborhood had been the site of Mardi Gras celebrations since 1977; with more than 90 civilians and 30 officers injured during disorders in 1979. Festivities on the Friday and Saturday leading up to 2001's Fat Tuesday were broken up by police with the city's bicycle patrol at the forefront of squashing festivities. On Saturday, the Seattle Police Department estimated a total between 4,000 and 6,000 people gathered in the area after midnight. The crowd pelted the officers with rocks and bottles after a suspect was arrested for carrying a handgun. Windows were also smashed before the crowd was dispersed through the use of pepper spray, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades. The heavy-handed tactics led to complaints from event goers. Up to 2,000 people gathered in the neighborhood on Sunday evening with fewer incidents. Celebrations were also violent in Austin, Fresno, and Philadelphia that year.\n\nOver 4,000 party goers initially filled the neighborhood and its bars on Tuesday evening. Police estimated large crowds began forming in the central plaza at 9:00 pm and eventually spilled into the surrounding streets. The celebrations included drinking, dancing, and women baring their breasts for beads. Throngs of men began groping the women as they exposed themselves. Police estimated that the crowd swelled to anywhere between 5,000 and 7,000 people as the evening continued.\n\nSporadic fighting broke out at about 10:40 pm. Police donned riot gear and formed lines but rarely entered the crowd. Some arrests were made at the periphery of the neighborhood's main square. Cars were vandalized and overturned. Small fires were set and the windows of business were shattered. Police were then notified that young men were brandishing handguns and other weapons towards people. By midnight, groups roved through the crowd randomly attacking people along the stretch of Yesler Way between First and Second Avenues. Paramedics were not able to reach some victims due to the lack of police control in the area.\n\nThe police stood by and did nothing as a group assaulted a female teenager; when a bystander, Kris Kime, attempted to protect her, the group beat him to death. Witnesses said Kime was struck and knocked to the ground as he tried to help the frightened woman who had fallen in the melee. Kime died of massive head injuries. About 70 others were reported injured with 2 suffering gunshot wounds.\n\nAt 12:30 am, 25 to 30 young men advanced on a line of police. The police retreated while bottles and other debris were thrown. A team of bicycle officers made a quick charge toward the crowd with pepper spray before retreating. Fighting escalated with little police interference until shots were fired from within the mass of people at 1:30 am. With the assistance of an armored vehicle, police advanced on the crowd with tear gas, pepper spray, and flashbangs. The crowds were finally dispersed shortly after 2:00 am.\n\nThe day after the riot, local newspapers carried a picture of a black man with brass knuckles engaged in an assault which came to symbolize the riot. An editorial in \"The Stranger\" said the incident was racially motivated and that much of the violence was directed at white civilians. Witnesses said gangs of black youth yelled racially charged slurs and sought white victims. Some eyewitnesses said that most of the attackers were black but that race was not a factor in who was victimized. According to the \"Seattle Weekly\", police did not initially see the attacks as solely or even predominately racial violence.\n\nRacial issues overshadowed the sexual assaults that took place. One man was charged with forcibly fondling a woman. A photograph of a partially nude woman being groped by some two dozen men while lying topless and on her back won an award from the National Press Photographer Association despite not being previously published in a newspaper.\n\nIn the wake of the riot, Schell announced a moratorium on Mardi Gras celebrations in Seattle. Schell lost to Greg Nickels and Mark Sidran in the city's 2001 mayoral primary elections. King County Executive Ron Sims called the Mardi Gras riot and the protests at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting \"defining issues\" in Schell's failed bid for reelection. Nickels made Kime's death a political issue in his campaign, saying the certificate of death would hang in his office should he become mayor. He kept the pledge upon taking the office. As mayor, Nickels retained Gil Kerlikowske as police chief despite criticism of the police department's inaction during the incident.\n\nOn the day after the Mardi Gras riot, Seattle experienced the 6.8 M Nisqually earthquake, the worst in 37 years. Its scale caused people to refocus their attention on earthquake recovery and away from the violence. Outside the Seattle area, the incidents attracted little media attention and have largely been forgotten. In 2011, local bars reattempted Mardi Gras celebrations in Pioneer Square. Smaller Mardi Gras events had been held but it was the first to consist of a collaboration between multiple establishments. Another group had considered organizing an event but the permitting process was too restrictive.\n\nKerlikowske originally ordered the police at the scene not to intervene, instead maintaining a perimeter around the growing violence. The City of Seattle acknowledged that the police strategy during the incidents presented a public safety threat, and the City made an almost $2,000,000 settlement with Kime's family. Mayor Paul Schell (who was at asleep at home during the events of Tuesday evening) appointed a three-member task force panel to investigate the cause of the riot. He instructed them not to discuss the lack of police intervention which the public had been concerned about. Initially task force meetings were closed to the public, but protest forced the city to open them to attendance. The Seattle Police Officers' Guild later voted no confidence in the chief, citing the Mardi Gras riot as one of the reasons.\n\nThat night, 21 were arrested. Dozens were later questioned by police after being identified through the use of videotape, photographs, and reports from eyewitnesses. Investigations showed that roughly 75% of the over 100 suspects were black. Many of the suspects had criminal records and were believed to be affiliated with gangs.\n\nThe man photographed and videotaped wearing brass knuckles and beating people, Aaron Slaughter, was sentenced to three years in prison for assaults on a woman and two men. It ran concurrently with a nine-month sentence he received for rendering criminal assistance during a brawl less than three months later.\n\nA 17-year-old, Jerell Thomas, was found guilty in the death of Kime after jurors saw video footage of Thomas hitting Kime in the head three times. He was also convicted of two counts of second-degree assault for attacking two other men with a skateboard. He originally received a 15-year sentence. His conviction was later overturned by a State's Supreme Court decision finding that assailants could not be found guilty of murder if the intent of the assault was not to take a life. In 2006, Thomas avoided a new trial and plead guilty to second-degree manslaughter. He received a 10-year sentence. In December 2009, Thomas was released from prison early. He soon reoffended.\n"}

A lawyer, politician, and judge from Quebec's Beauce region, Cliche also served as head of the Quebec branch of the New Democratic Party.\n\nThe A-73 begins at a roundabout junction with Route 204 in Saint-Georges, tracing the course of the Chaudière River to its junction with Autoroute 20 in Saint-Romuald. Along the way, the A-73 connects the largest cities and towns in Quebec's historic Beauce region. Exit numbers on the A-73 begin at km 43 (which accounts for an as-yet unbuilt section to the Maine border). Initially, much of the A-73 south of the Saint Lawrence River was built as a super-two (one lane in each direction) highway with no median. Work to expand the autoroute to four lanes was completed in 2016. Motorists wishing to continue southward to Maine must currently travel on Route 173, a two-lane highway.\n\nApproaching metropolitan Quebec City, the A-73 meets the A-20 (co-signed as a section of the Trans-Canada Highway) at an interchange just south of the Saint Lawrence River. From here, motorists can take the A-20 east to Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, and the Gaspé Peninsula; and west to Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa (via the A-40 and Ontario Highway 417).\n\nThe A-73 crosses the Saint Lawrence via the Pierre Laporte Bridge—the longest suspension bridge in Canada.\n\nNorth of the river, the A-73 is named for Henri IV (Henri-Quatre), King of France at the time of the city of Québec's founding in 1608.\n\nThe A-73 provides a partial beltway around metropolitan Quebec to the west and north of the central city. At kilometer 134, the A-73 intersects with the A-540, a spur route connecting the A-73 and A-40 with the approach to Jean-Lesage International Airport.\n\nAt kilometer 139, the A-73 meets the A-40 and A-440. From here, motorists can take the A-40 west to Trois-Rivières and Montreal, or the A-440 east to Quebec City centre. North of this interchange, A-73 is signed as a concurrency with the A-40 for .\n\nOnce co-signed with the A-40, the A-73 assumes the name assigned to the A-40. Leclerc was a singer-songwriter, poet, writer, actor and political activist.\n\nThe A-73/40 continues north for three kilometers to a junction with Autoroute 573, a spur route that provides access to the CFB Valcartier military base. At this intersection, the A-73/40 exit the autoroute, which continues as the A-573. From here, the A-73/40 continues due east, bypassing Quebec City to the north. Whereas the A-73/40 uses A-73 distance-based exit numbers prior to the junction with the A-573, past this point, A-40 distance based exit numbers are used. (This anomaly reflects an unbuilt section of the A-40, which would have started at Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures, bypassed Jean-Lesage AIrport to the north, and connected with the present-day A-73/40 at the A-573 interchange.)\n\nThe A-73/40 intersects with the A-740 (a spur route connecting Sainte-Foy with the northern suburbs) at exit 310.\n\nAt exit 313, A-73 exits the autoroute at a cloverleaf interchange. North of the junction, the A-73 continues through Quebec City's northern suburbs. South of the junction, the autoroute is signed as Autoroute 973. The A-973 is a spur route which terminates just north of Quebec City centre. The A-40 continues eastward for another ten kilometers to a terminus with the A-440 just east of the city centre.\nThe most northerly section of the A-73 is named for the Laurentian Mountains, a popular destination for outdoor sports north of Quebec City.\n\nAfter the split with the A-40, the A-73 enters the foothills of the Laurentians. The autoroute provides access to the Stoneham Mountain Resort at kilometer 167 and bypasses Stoneham and Tewkesbury to the east. This stretch is cosigned with Route 175. The A-73 ends at kilometer 182, with a final exit at Boulevard Talbot in Stoneham. The road continues as Route 175, which provides a link between Quebec City and the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region to the north.\n\nCommunity leaders continue to press for Transports Québec to extend the A-73 south to the Maine border. The issue resurfaced during a 2015 by-elections in Beauce-Sud, when Coalition Avenir Québec leader François Legault announced his support for extending the A-73 to Maine as a priority for his party if elected. For its part, Maine continues to debate private financing, construction, and operation of a proposed East-West Highway linking Quebec with the Maritime Provinces. The proposed route, however, would involve connecting with an extended section of Autoroute 10, not the A-73, with the Autoroute 10 crossing some 57 km (35 mi) southwest of it. Maine currently has no plans to convert U.S. Route 201 to Interstate standards, which would provide an all-freeway connection from Quebec City to Interstate 95.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2013, the governments of Quebec and Canada co-funded reconstruction of Route 175 into a partially-controlled access freeway between the end of A-73 in Stoneham and the junction with the A-70 in Saguenay. This prompted speculation that the A-73 designation would be extended further northward into the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. As the reconstructed Route 175 is not fully a controlled-access highway, it does not meet Autoroute design standards. Thus, A-73's terminus remains at Stoneham unless and until corresponding sections of Route 175 are upgraded to controlled-access freeway. Quebec Autoroute 70 remains the only autoroute in Quebec that does not directly connect to any other.\n\n \n\n"}

{"id": "1865916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865916", "title": "Signalling (economics)", "text": "Signalling (economics)\n\nIn contract theory, signalling (or signaling; see spelling differences) is the idea that one party (termed the agent) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the principal). Although signalling theory was initially developed by Michael Spence based on observed knowledge gaps between organisations and prospective employees, its intuitive nature led it to be adapted to many other domains, such as Human Resource Management, business, and financial markets.\n\nIn Michael Spence's job-market signaling model, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring education credentials. The informational value of the credential comes from the fact that the employer believes the credential is positively correlated with having the greater ability and difficulty for low ability employees to obtain. Thus the credential enables the employer to reliably distinguish low ability workers from high ability workers. The concept of signaling is also applicable in competitive altruistic interaction, where the capacity of the receiving party is limited. \n\nSignalling took root in the idea of asymmetric information (a deviation from perfect information), which says that in some economic transactions, inequalities in access to information upset the normal market for the exchange of goods and services. In his seminal 1973 article, Michael Spence proposed that two parties could get around the problem of asymmetric information by having one party send a signal that would reveal some piece of relevant information to the other party. That party would then interpret the signal and adjust his or her purchasing behaviour accordingly—usually by offering a higher price than if she had not received the signal.\nThere are, of course, many problems that these parties would immediately run into.\n\nIn the job market, potential employees seek to sell their services to employers for some wage, or price. Generally, employers are willing to pay higher wages to employ better workers. While the individual may know his or her own level of ability, the hiring firm is not (usually) able to observe such an intangible trait—thus there is an asymmetry of information between the two parties. Education credentials can be used as a signal to the firm, indicating a certain level of ability that the individual may possess; thereby narrowing the informational gap. This is beneficial to both parties as long as the signal indicates a desirable attribute—a signal such as a criminal record may not be so desirable.\n\nMichael Spence considers hiring as a type of investment under uncertainty analogous to buying a lottery ticket and refers to the attributes of an applicant which are observable to the employer as indices. Of these, attributes which the applicant can manipulate are termed signals. Applicant age is thus an index but is not a signal since it does not change at the discretion of the applicant. The employer is supposed to have conditional probability assessments of productive capacity, based on previous experience of the market, for each combination of indices and signals. The employer updates those assessments upon observing each employee's characteristics. The paper is concerned with a risk-neutral employer. The offered wage is the expected marginal product. Signals may be acquired by sustaining signalling costs (monetary and not). If everyone invests in the signal in the exactly the same way, then the signal can't be used as discriminatory, therefore a critical assumption is made: the costs of signalling are negatively correlated with productivity. This situation as described is a feedback loop: the employer updates his beliefs upon new market information and updates the wage schedule, applicants react by signalling, and recruitment takes place. Michael Spence studies the signalling equilibrium that may result from such a situation. He began his 1973 model with a hypothetical example: suppose that there are two types of employees—good and bad—and that employers are willing to pay a higher wage to the good type than the bad type. Spence assumes that for employers, there's no real way to tell in advance which employees will be of the good or bad type. Bad employees aren't upset about this, because they get a free ride from the hard work of the good employees. But good employees know that they deserve to be paid more for their higher productivity, so they desire to invest in the signal—in this case, some amount of education. But he does make one key assumption: \"good-type employees pay less for one unit of education than bad-type employees\". The cost he refers to is not necessarily the cost of tuition and living expenses, sometimes called out of pocket expenses, as one could make the argument that higher ability persons tend to enroll in \"better\" (i.e. more expensive) institutions. Rather, the cost Spence is referring to is the opportunity cost. This is a combination of 'costs', monetary and otherwise, including psychological, time, effort and so on. Of key importance to the value of the signal is the differing cost structure between \"good\" and \"bad\" workers. The cost of obtaining identical credentials is strictly lower for the \"good\" employee than it is for the \"bad\" employee. The differing cost structure need not preclude \"bad\" workers from obtaining the credential. All that is necessary for the signal to have value (informational or otherwise) is that the group with the signal is positively correlated with the previously unobservable group of \"good\" workers. In general, the degree to which a signal is thought to be correlated to unknown or unobservable attributes is directly related to its value.\n\nSpence discovered that even if education did not contribute anything to an employee's productivity, it could still have value to both the employer and employee. If the appropriate cost/benefit structure exists (or is created), \"good\" employees will buy more education in order to signal their higher productivity.\n\nThe increase in wages associated with obtaining a higher credential is sometimes referred to as the “sheepskin effect”, since “sheepskin” informally denotes a diploma. It is important to note that this is not the same as the returns from an additional year of education. The \"sheepskin\" effect is actually the wage increase above what would normally be attributed to the extra year of education. This can be observed empirically in the wage differences between 'drop-outs' vs. 'completers' with an equal number of years of education. It is also important that one does not equate the fact that higher wages are paid to more educated individuals entirely to signalling or the 'sheepskin' effects. In reality, education serves many different purposes for individuals and society as a whole. Only when all of these aspects, as well as all the many factors affecting wages, are controlled for, does the effect of the \"sheepskin\" approach its true value. Empirical studies of signalling indicate it as a statistically significant determinant of wages, however, it is one of a host of other attributes—age, sex, and geography are examples of other important factors.\n\nTo illustrate his argument, Spence imagines, for simplicity, two productively distinct groups in a population facing one employer. The signal under consideration is education, measured by an index y and is subject to individual choice. Education costs are both monetary and psychic. The data can be summarized as:\n\nSuppose that the employer believes that there is a level of education y* below which productivity is 1 and above which productivity is 2. His offered wage schedule W(y) will be:\n\nWorking with these hypotheses Spence shows that:\n\n\nIn conclusion, even if education has no real contribution to the marginal product of the worker, the combination of the beliefs of the employer and the presence of signalling transforms the education level y* in a prerequisite for the higher paying job. It may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labor, without this necessarily being true.\n\nFor a signal to be effective, certain conditions must be true. In equilibrium, the cost of obtaining the credential must be lower for high productivity workers and act as a signal to the employer such that they will pay a higher wage.\n\nIn this model it is optimal for the higher ability person to obtain the credential (the observable signal) but not for the lower ability individual. The table shows the outcome of low ability person l and high ability person h with and without signal S:\n\nThe structure is as follows:\nThere are two individuals with differing abilities (productivity) levels.\n\nThe premise for the model is that a person of high ability (h) has a lower cost for obtaining a given level of education than does a person of lower ability (l). Cost can be in terms of monetary, such as tuition, or psychological, stress incurred to obtain the credential.\n\nFor the individual:\n\nThus, if both individuals act rationally it is optimal for person h to obtain S but not for person l so long as the following conditions are satisfied.\n\nEdit: note that this is incorrect with the example as graphed. Both 'l' and 'h' have lower costs than W* at the education level. Also, Person and Person are not clear.\n\nEdit: note that this is ok as for low type \"l\": formula_3 , and thus low type will choose Do not obtain credential.\n\nEdit: For there to be a separating equilibrium the high type 'h' must also check their outside option; do they want to choose the net pay in the separating equilibrium (calculated above) over the net pay in the pooling equilibrium. Thus we also need to test that: formula_4 Otherwise high type 'h' will choose Do not obtain credential of the pooling equilibrium.\n\nFor the employers:\n\nIn equilibrium, in order for the signalling model to hold, the employer must recognize the signal and pay the corresponding wage and this will result in the workers self-sorting into the two groups. One can see that the cost/benefit structure for a signal to be effective must fall within certain bounds or else the system will fail.\n\nLeland and Pyle (1977) analyze the role of signals within the process of IPO. The authors show how companies with good future perspectives and higher possibilities of success (\"good companies\") should always send clear signals to the market when going public; the owner should keep control of a significant percentage of the company. To be reliable, the signal must be too costly to be imitated by \"bad companies\". If no signal is sent to the market, asymmetric information will result in adverse selection in the IPO market.\n\nWaldfogel and Chen (2006) demonstrate the importance of brands in signalling quality in online marketplaces.\n\nSignalling has been studied and proposed as a means to address asymmetric information in markets for \"lemons\". Recently, signalling theory has been applied in used cars market such as eBay Motors. Lewis (2011) examines the role of information access and shows that the voluntary disclosure of private information increases the prices of used cars on eBay. Dimoka et al. (2012) analyzed data from eBay Motors on the role of signals to mitigate product uncertainty. Extending the information asymmetry literature in consumer behavior literature from the agent (seller) to the product, authors theorized and validated the nature and dimensions of product uncertainty, which is distinct from, yet shaped by, seller uncertainty. Authors also found information signals (diagnostic product descriptions and third-party product assurances) to reduce product uncertainty, which negatively affect price premiums (relative to the book values) of the used cars in online used cars markets.\n\nIn internet-based hospitality exchange networks such as BeWelcome and Warm Showers, hosts do not expect to receive payments from travelers. The relation between traveler and host is rather shaped by mutual altruism. Travelers send homestay requests to the hosts, which the hosts are not obligated to accept. Both networks as non-profit organizations grant trustworthy teams of scientists access to their anonymized data for publication of insights to the benefit of humanity. In 2015, datasets from BeWelcome and Warm Showers were analyzed. Analysis of 97,915 homestay requests from BeWelcome and 285,444 homestay requests from Warm Showers showed general regularity — the less time is spent on writing a homestay request, the less is the probability of being accepted by a host. Low-effort communication aka 'copy and paste requests' obviously sends the wrong signal. \n\nMost signalling models are plagued by a multiplicity of possible equilibrium outcomes. In a study published in the \"Journal of Economic Theory\", a signalling model has been proposed that has a unique equilibrium outcome. In the principal-agent model it is argued that an agent will choose a large (observable) investment level when he has a strong outside option. Yet, an agent with a weak outside option might try to bluff by also choosing a large investment, in order to make the principal believe that the agent has a strong outside option (so that the principal will make a better contract offer to the agent). Hence, when an agent has private information about his outside option, signalling may mitigate the hold-up problem.\n\n"}

{"id": "1865924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865924", "title": "Geist", "text": "Geist\n\nGeist () is a German noun with a degree of importance in German philosophy. Its semantic field corresponds to English ghost, spirit, mind, intellect. Some English translators resort to using \"spirit/mind\" or \"spirit (mind)\" to help convey the meaning of the term. \n\n\"Geist\" is also a central concept in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's 1807 \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (\"Phänomenologie des Geistes\"). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of world history of the late 18th century, include Weltgeist \"world-spirit\", Volksgeist \"national spirit\" and Zeitgeist \"spirit of the age\".\n\nGerman \"Geist\" (masculine gender) continues Old High German \"geist\", attested as the translation of Latin \"spiritus\". \nIt is the direct cognate of English \"ghost\", from a West Germanic \"gaistaz\". Its derivation from a PIE root \"g̑heis-\" \"to be agitated, frightened\" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening (c.f. English ghastly) apparitions or ghosts, and may also have carried the connotation of \"ecstatic agitation, \"furor\"\" related to the cult of Germanic Mercury. \nAs the translation of biblical Latin \"spiritus\" (Greek πνεῦμα) \"spirit, breath\" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the Holy Spirit (Old English \"sē hālga gāst\" \"the Holy Ghost\", OHG \" ther heilago geist\", Modern German \"der Heilige Geist\").\nThe English word is in competition with Latinate \"spirit\" from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.\n\nThe German noun much like English \"spirit\" could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead, to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the \"spirit of wine\", i.e. ethanol. \nHowever, its special meaning of \"mind, intellect\" never shared by English \"ghost\" is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French \"esprit\".\nIn this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.\n\"Geist\" could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.\nIt is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of \"geistlich\" \"spiritual, pertaining to religion\" vs. \"geistig\" \"intellectual, pertaining to the mind\" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts is made by the adjective \"geisterhaft\" \"ghostly, spectral\".\n\nNumerous compounds are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as \"Geistesgegenwart\" = \"présence d'esprit\" (\"mental presence, acuity\"), \"Geistesabwesenheit\" = \"absence d’esprit\" (\"mental absence, distraction\"), \"geisteskrank\" \"mentally ill\", \"geistreich\" \"witty, intellectually brilliant\", \"geistlos\" \"unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous\" etc. \nIt is from these developments that certain German compounds containing \"-geist\" have been loaned into English, such as \"Zeitgeist\".\n\nGerman \"Geist\" in this particular sense of \"mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit\" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain \"Geist\" as a German loanword.\n\n\"Geist\" is a central concept in Hegel's \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (\"Phänomenologie des Geistes\"). According to Hegel, the \"Weltgeist\" (\"world spirit\") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history. \"Weltgeist\" is effected in history through the mediation of various \"Volksgeister\" (\"national spirits\"), the great men of history, such as Napoleon, are the \"concrete universal\".\n\nThis has led some to claim that Hegel favored the great man theory, although his philosophy of history, in particular concerning the role of the \"universal state\" (\"Universalstaat\", which means a universal \"order\" or \"statute\" rather than \"state\"), and of an \"End of History\" is much more complex.\n\nFor Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by \"Geist\" or \"absolute spirit\", by a \"ruse of reason\" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the teleological principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.\n\n\"Weltgeist\", the world spirit concept, designates an idealistic principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained objective reality as its product. (See metaphysical objectivism) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle all paid homage, amongst other things, to the concept of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.\n\n\"Weltgeist\" \"world-spirit\" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of \"secularism, impiety, irreligiosity\" (\"spiritus mundi\"), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of \"man of the world\", \"mundane or secular person\".\nAlso from the 17th century, \"Weltgeist\" acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of \"world-spirit\" or \"world-soul\" (\"anima mundi, spiritus universi\") in the sense of Panentheism, a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction between magnet and iron or between Moon and tide.\n\nThis idea of \"Weltgeist\" in the sense of \"anima mundi\" became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, \"der Geist\" on its own could refer to this concept, as in Christian Thomasius, \"Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes\" (1709).\nBelief in a \"Weltgeist\" as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of Goethe, in the later part of the 18th century.\n\nAlready in the poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the \"Weltgeist\" \nappears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of Nature.\n\n\"Weltgeist\" in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of God and can be attributed agency and will. \nHerder, who tended to prefer the form \"Weltengeist\" (as it were \"spirit of worlds\"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:\nThe term was notably embraced by Hegel and his followers in the early 19th century.\nFor the 19th century, the term as used by Hegel (1807) became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing world history:\n\nHegel's description of Napoleon as \"the world-soul on horseback\" (\"die Weltseele zu Pferde\") became proverbial.\nThe phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in a letter written on 13 October 1806, the day before the Battle of Jena, to his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer:\nI saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.\n\nThe letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.\nIt is used without attribution by Meyer Kayserling in his \"Sephardim\" (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in \"Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen\", who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's \"bad jokes\" (\"schlechte Witze\").\nThe phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century.\n\n\"Volksgeist\" or \"Nationalgeist\" refers to a \"spirit\" of an individual people (\"Volk\"), its \"national spirit\" or \"national character\". The term \"Nationalgeist\" is used in the 1760s by Justus Möser and by Johann Gottfried Herder. The term \"Nation\" at this time is used in the sense of \"natio\" \"nation, ethnic group, race\", mostly replaced by the term \"Volk\" after 1800.\nIn the early 19th century, the term \"Volksgeist\" was used by Friedrich Carl von Savigny in order to express the \"popular\" sense of justice.\nSavigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an \"esprit des nations \" used by Voltaire. and of the \"esprit général\" invoked by Montesquieu.\n\nHegel uses the term in his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of History\".\nBased on the Hegelian use of the term, Wilhelm Wundt, Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal in the mid-19th-century established the field of \"Völkerpsychologie\" (\"psychology of nations\").\n\nIn Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, Schlegel and the Brothers Grimm. In the history of cultures, Herder. In the history of the State or political history, Hegel. In the field of law, Savigny and in the field of psychology Wundt. This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to Romanticism as it is commonly known.\nThe concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology George W. Stocking, Jr., \"… one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist.\"\n\nThe compound \"Zeitgeist\" (;, \"spirit of the age\" or \"spirit of the times\") similarly to \"Weltgeist\" describes \nan invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history.\nThe term is now mostly associated with Hegel, contrasting with Hegel's use of \"Volksgeist\" \"national spirit\" and \"Weltgeist\" \"world-spirit\", \nbut its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to Herder and Goethe.\nThe term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to a fashion or fad which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of architecture.\n\nHegel in \"Phenomenology of the Spirit\" (1807) uses both \"Weltgeist\" and \"Volksgeist\" but prefers the phrase \"Geist der Zeiten\" \"spirit of the times\" over the compound \"Zeitgeist\".\n\nHegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a \"free and ethical culture\".\n\nThe term has also been used more widely in the sense of an intellectual or aesthetic fashion or fad.\nFor example, Charles Darwin's 1859 proposition that evolution occurs by natural selection has been cited as a case of the \"zeitgeist\" of the epoch, an idea \"whose time had come\", seeing that his contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, was outlining similar models during the same period. \nSimilarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of logical positivism in the 1920s, leading to a focus on behaviorism and blank-slatism over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s, the shift from behaviorism to post-modernism and critical theory can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic \"zeitgeist\".\n\"Zeitgeist\" in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his \"theory of leadership\" and in other publications describing models of business or industry.\nMalcolm Gladwell argued in his book \"Outliers\" that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.\n\n\n\n"}
