They opened on 2 November 1959, the same day as the M1, making them the oldest motorway services in Britain. The facilities were originally managed by Blue Boar, a local company that had run a nearby petrol station before the M1 opened. Roadchef bought the services from Blue Boar in 1995.\n\nThe main building was designed by Harry Weedon, the architect for Odeon Cinemas, while the layout and general buildings were designed by coordinating architect Owen Williams. The main building was not ready on opening, so food was served from temporary sheds. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but due to the site's reputation as a truck stop, was redesigned in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service. The services became a meeting place for rock bands in the 1960s, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, as it provided a convenient place to sit down and eat a meal in the early hours of the morning. In the 1970s, the quality of the services declined and the food came in for harsh criticism from journalists and artists, such as Roy Harper. Since purchase in 1995, Roadchef have refurbished the premises. They have promoted its history, including the association with a north / south divide, and its regular use by 1960s rock musicians. A number of events took place to celebrate the 50th anniversary in November 2009, including a musical about the services.\n\nThe services are named after the nearby Watford Gap, a crossing point of the limestone ridge just north of the village of Watford; the name is unrelated to that of the town of Watford in Hertfordshire. Watford Gap is considered by some to be on a dividing line that separates the north and the south of England.\n\nThe services are in Northamptonshire, England close to the village of Watford about to the south east of Rugby and about to the north west of London. They are situated between junctions 16 and 17 of the M1 with a single site for each direction on the motorway linked by a footbridge. The name comes from the nearby Watford Gap, the narrowest and lowest point in the limestone ridge that crosses England diagonally from the Cotswolds to Lincoln Edge. In Roman Britain, Iter II, later named Watling Street, crossed the gap; Thomas Telford considered the route unsuitable for coach traffic due to the presence of quicksand. Today, this is reflected in the modern road network by the A5 suddenly turning left towards Kilsby near the services. Similarly, the Grand Union Canal (which runs immediately behind the northbound vehicle park) avoided the gap by the Crick Tunnel. Consequently, the Roman Road at Watford Gap was largely untouched by previous engineering works when the M1 was constructed, and the engineers were able to build over it.\n\nIn popular culture, the Watford Gap is often considered to be a dividing line that separates the north and the south of England. The phrase \"north of the Watford gap\" may be shortened to \"north of Watford\", inviting confusion with the larger town of Watford further south in Hertfordshire. Roadchef have suggested that the services' name should be included in the Oxford English Dictionary as an expression of the divide between the north and south.\n\nThe services, the first of its kind in the UK, opened at the same time as the new motorway on 2 November 1959. They evolved from discussions during 1955 and 1956 by the Ministry of Transport over what facilities should be present on new motorways. Civil engineer Owen Williams visited the United States to see what existing rest areas were available, and based his designs on these. Watford Gap was chosen as one of four pilot sites, though by 1958 the Ministry had decided only this and Newport Pagnell services would open with the motorway.\n\nThe land on which the services were built belonged to the Thorntons of Brock Hall, who had owned the manor since 1625. The family had previously attempted to block the Grand Union Canal and the main London – Birmingham railway across the gap, without success. Brock Hall was eventually sold in 1969 and converted into flats.\nThe structure was built on the site of derelict farm buildings. There were different designers for different parts of the service area, with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect. An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams-Ellis was rejected in favour of a more functional and conservative modernist design by Owen Williams. When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds. The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell. In practice, however, both service areas were unrestricted. The first owners of the services were Blue Boar Limited, a family company that owned a nearby petrol station on the A5. Although the official name has always been Watford Gap, the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening.\n\nThe original buildings at Watford Gap were designed by Harry W Weedon and Partners, already well known for their work for Odeon Cinemas. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but the Ministry were unhappy about the services' reputation as a truck-stop, dating back to Blue Boar's popularity with HGV drivers. They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service, which they hoped would \"lose at least some of the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver's facility\". Food was criticised for being expensive, though Tam Galbraith disputed this, noting he could buy steak and kidney pie with chips, buttered roll and a cup of tea at Watford Gap for 4s 2d (£ today).\n\nBy the 1970s, a combination of the recession, overpriced food, and fear of football hooligans had greatly reduced the services' popularity. The quality of the food declined substantially and, because of its prominent location, the services became a byword for poor catering. Roy Harper wrote a song criticising the food at the Watford Gap on his 1977 album, \"Bullinamingvase\", writing: \"Watford Gap, Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap\". The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food, as did an EMI board member who was also a non-executive director of Blue Boar. Harper defended his decision to write the song, claiming the food was \"junk. Absolute junk\". In 1989, one journalist claimed the services had some of the worst food found on the road network, adding \"if I threw the toast out of the window, it would probably still be bouncing up the M1.\" Roadchef purchased the motorway businesses from Blue Boar in 1995 and have since improved facilities. In 2011 and 2012 it was rated as 3 stars by quality assessors at Visit England.\n\nRoadchef celebrated the services' 50th anniversary on 2 November 2009 by selling cups of tea at 1959 prices. A road sign was erected pointing to \"The North\" and \"The South\" on the same day. As part of the anniversary celebrations, local film-maker and composer Benjamin Till created a musical about Watford Gap. The show featured stories from eighty people who had worked or been associated with the services, including local residents who remembered the services opening.\n\nThough the Ministry of Transport was adamant that the services should not be destinations in their own right, they did acquire a reputation for being a popular place for motorists to visit. During the 1960s, the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career. Jimi Hendrix heard so much about \"Blue Boar\", as the services were then popularly known, that he thought it was a London nightclub. Gerry Marsden, leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring, saying it was good for \"a quick stop and a quick nosh.\" The Floyd's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am, while The Zombies' Chris White thought the services were \"the feeding trough of the beat boom\". Harper claimed \"everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit-down at 2am\".\n\nThe services' association with 1960s musicians is remembered in a set of photographs published in 2008 of the Stones stopping at Watford Gap on the way to ATV Studios, Birmingham in 1963. In 2009, Roadchef paid a former employee £1,000 for autographs he had collected while working there, including those of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Dusty Springfield and Cliff Richard. In July 2011, music journalist Peter Paphides presented \"Late Nights at the Blue Boar\", a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the connection between the services and Britain's 1960s rock bands.\n\n\n"}

It was a subsidiary of National Express before being sold in May 2009 to NedRailways. In October 2009, it was rebranded as Abellio London.\n\nIn June 1998, National Express commenced operating routes C1 and 211 under the Travel London brand, using the same symbol and typeface as sister brand Travel West Midlands. In August 2000 National Express sold the business to Limebourne Buses, who in July 2001 sold out to Connex. In February 2004, National Express repurchased the business. Further expansion in 2005 saw the purchases of the London bus operations of Tellings-Golden Miller with a depot in Byfleet and various Surrey County Council contracts.\n\nTravel London operated contracts on behalf of Transport for London, Surrey County Council, and Kingston University. Operations were split between three registered companies; Travel London Limited, Travel London (West) Limited, and Travel London (Middlesex) Limited. The Surrey routes were rebranded as Travel Surrey in September 2007.\n\nIn November 2007, National Express announced plans to re-brand all of their operations under a new unified National Express identity. Travel London was to be rebranded as National Express London however this was shelved and all bus operations retained their existing identities.\n\nIn May 2009, National Express sold Travel London to NedRailways. The sale included 66 routes, 36 Transport for London tendered services and 30 Surrey County Council and Kingston University routes. All vehicles, depots and staff were included.\n\nOn 30 October 2009 the businesses were rebranded as Abellio London and Abellio Surrey.\n\nTravel London Limited operated garages at Beddington Cross, Queenstown (Battersea) and Walworth Road, operating 66, 82 and 98 buses respectively (246 in total) when the company was renamed.\n\nBeddington Cross operated London Buses routes 3, 152, 157, 434, G1, P13, and night route N3, and was opened by Connex in 2000 to house their newly won route 3.\n\nQueenstown operated routes 35, 156, 211, 452, C3, 24-hour route 344 and night route N35.\n\nWalworth Road operated routes 40, 100, 129, 188, 343, 381, C1, night routes N343 and N381.\n\nOriginally a site acquired by the London County Council for its electric trams, it was known as Camberwell Tram depot until 1950 when its name was changed to Walworth with the arrival of buses. This was to avoid confusion with Camberwell Garage located opposite the Walworth garage. Major rebuilding took place during the 1950s to repair bomb damage from the World War II during which time some buses were worked out of Camberwell.\n\nIn the late 1960s the garage assumed operation of the Red Arrow routes with MBAs and later LSs until its closure in 1985. Following the closure of the Victoria and Ash Grove garages, from 1987 Walworth operated the Red Arrow routes for a short time until the Waterloo garage was ready.\n\nDuring the early 1990s the garage once again re-opened, this time for the Londonlinks operation of routes 78 and 176. The Cowie Group undertook a major restructure a few years later which once again saw closure of Walworth garage in 1997. The garage was owned by the Go-Ahead Group and they leased it out.\n\nThe garage lay dormant for the next six years until late 2003 when work started on refurbishing the garage for Travel London, who needed more garage space after some contract wins including routes 381, 452 and N381.\n\nTravel London won the contract for route 407, starting from 31 October 2009.

{"id": "2079003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079003", "title": "Meconopsis", "text": "Meconopsis\n\nMeconopsis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It was first described by French botanist Viguier in 1814 who named it as poppy-like (from Greek \"mekon\" poppy, \"opsis\" alike). The species have attractive flowers and have two distinct ranges. The 40 or so (depending on classification) species are found in the Himalayas. Within the Himalayan types there is much debate as to what constitutes a particular species as many readily hybridise with each other and produce viable seed. It is likely that some individually named species are in fact a single species but with an under-appreciated morphological diversity.\n\nA large proportion of species are monocarpic and as such are notoriously difficult to maintain in cultivation.\n\n\"Meconopsis grandis\", known as the blue poppy, was thought to be the national flower of Bhutan. However, in 2017, after three years of study conducted by the National Biodiversity Centre, Bhutan, and the Blue Poppy Society in Japan, it was found that the national flower of Bhutan was misidentified as \n\"Meconopsis grandis\". \"Meconopsis grandis\" is not found in Bhutan and the earlier Blue Poppy was named based on specimens collected in 1933.\n\nThrough field experience and studies, the National Biodiversity Centre noticed the differences. A new species was discovered and it was given a Dzongkha name ‘Gakyid (དགའ་སྐྱིད)’. The name was inspired by the concept of Gross National Happiness. So the new species is named as \"Meconopsis gakyidiana\"\n\nAnother two new species of blue poppy were also discovered in addition to the national flower of Bhutan. They are named as \"Meconopsis merakensis\" and \"Meconopsis elongata\". The new species can be found in Merak (མེ་རག), Sagteng (སག་སྟེང་) and Haa (ཧཱ) regions in Bhutan.\n\nIn the late spring of 1922, a British Himalayan expedition, led by legendary mountaineer George Leigh Mallory, discovered the plant on their failed attempt to reach the summit of the then-unconquered Mount Everest. The flowers were introduced to much excitement at the Royal Horticultural Society's spring show of 1926. However, since they are difficult to grow, the species has become fabled over the decades. In 2009, horticulturalist and author Bill Terry published his \"gardening memoir\", \"Blue Heaven\", about the plant.\n\nBlue poppies do not produce opium.\n\nHimalayan varieties have the reputation for being difficult to grow from seed, but when germinating new plants, using fresh seeds will help. On the other hand, the Welsh Poppy is sometimes considered a weed, albeit a handsome one, due to its vigorous self-seeding. It comes as a surprise to many that poppies are available in shades of blue. These plants are available in a variety of strong colours, including blue, red, orange, purple, white and yellow depending on species and cultivar.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Meconopsis\" has been affected by the invasive golden root mealybug. Damping off may occur on seedling grown plants.\n\n"}

The album was recorded and produced by Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker, mixed by Ylwizaker at Beep Jam Studio and mastered by Audun Strype at Strype Audio.\n\n\"Perdition City\" continues the experimentation heard on \"Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" and \"Metamorphosis\", containing elements of trip hop, jazz, ambient music, spoken word and electronica, the combination being described as \"moody\", \"atmospheric\", and \"cinematic in scope\". The album received positive reviews upon release, with Kerrang! noting, \"This ain't rock 'n roll. This is evolution on such a grand scale that most bands wouldn't even be able to wrap their tiny little minds around it.\"\n\nThe \"Metamorphosis\" EP, issued in September 1999, showcased Ulver's new electronic sound, delving into what would become the foundation for all future records,\n\nNow consisting of only two members — Rygg and Ylwizaker — the duo started to incorporate field recordings into their work. During the making of \"Perdition City\" Ylwizaker would hang microphones outside the window of his 5th floor apartment to capture the sounds of the inner city streets.\n\nSubtitled \"\"Music to an Interior Film\"\", \"Perdition City\", and companion EP’s \"Silence Teaches You How to Sing\" and \"Silencing the Singing\", represent the transition to the band's work in film scores, largely inspired by the results of electronic programming and digital sound manipulation they had experimented with during the recording of \"Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\". In response to the subtitle, Rygg adds, \"We mean just what we say, an abstract \"inner movie\". It wouldn't be wise to comment on anything afterwards in case there would be a hidden message.\" Leonards Lair state that \"Perdition City\" is “much more than background music, which is capable of adding atmosphere to a film, but taken out of context as a standalone piece is ultimately worthless. This music is too obtrusive, and to be frank, too good for a soundtrack.“\n\nExpanding on the photography included in the \"Perdition City\" booklet, Rygg comments, \"We didn't consciously think of taking the listener into a concrete city, it's more of a metaphor and abstract. A friend of mine who has written books and taken many photographs inspired me to capture weird pictures. We then compiled the best of them to support the story the lyrics make. We tried to make an anti-aesthetic whole that would create a documentary feeling.\"\n\nPrinted in the sleeve note is states: \"This is for the stations before and after sleep. Headphones and darkness recommended.\" Rygg adds, “Darkness is always fascinating, as well as the great void. It doesn’t matter under which aesthetic circumstances this void appears. It is always there and that was important for us to realize on \"Perdition City\": the void is even over the voice. (…) It is funny you call us criminal alchemists. Indeed in our lyrics there are enough criminal and alchemical aspects, or fascinating borderline topics, to be more concrete. That all takes place in the dead city, or better: in a centre, an imagined location of nowhere and nothing.”\n\nRygg, commenting in Unrestrained magazine in 2007, said, \"It's like I say, we only have three consistent albums. I think \"Nattens madrigal\" is one, I think \"Perdition City\" is one, and I think this new one [\"Shadows of the Sun\"]. They all sound pretty dead set. We were heavily into stuff like Amon Tobin, Warp Records, et cetera, and that certainly influenced the sound of that one.\" Continuing, “[Making film soundtracks] was more painstaking work than we thought. It's exciting work, but it's also more commercially orientated. You can apply your own tastes and your own vision, of course, but only to a certain extent. It always comes down to what the director and producers have in mind. And I respect that, as they are the ones with lots of money at stake. As a musician, it's an advantage if you get involved early in the process, before the editing is done because then you can cross edit sounds and images for better momentum or what have you. Whereas if the stuff is already edited, it can be difficult to get it to fit. Also, you have to learn to put your ego aside because the film itself is obviously the priority, so it's not like making an album. It's not music on its own terms. It's an underscore, aimed more at the subconscious experience. In a cinema context, you're not really supposed to listen to the music, but feel it.\"\n\nWriting for AllMusic, William York commented positively, “Fifth album, \"Perdition City\" is an album of moody, atmospheric electronica, built up around basic down-tempo beats and noir-ish electronic piano harmonies, and then fleshed out with various blips and bleeps, static noises, samples, and occasional vocals.” Additionally, Johnathan Hill highlighted the album's \"jazz-tinged\" moments, noting that the \"rich and varied instrumental passages\" allowed for a greater level of depth to the band's musical explorations.\n\nConversely, David M. Pecoraro from Pitchfork rated the album 2.6/10 and declared, “Who knows? Maybe \"Perdition City\" was nothing more than a well-intentioned but ultimately ill-advised experiment for these guys. Ulver might want to consider a return to their metal roots.”\n\n\"Catalept\" is a remix of \"Prelude\" from the film \"Psycho\".\n\n"}

They and many other US entertainment industry figures were subsequently blacklisted, which denied Maltz employment in the industry for many years.\n\nAlbert Maltz was the third of three sons born to Bernard Morris Maltz, a Russian immigrant born in modern-day Lithuania, and Lena Schereaschetsky (later Sherry), also an immigrant from a Russia-controlled area. Born into an affluent Jewish family, in Brooklyn, New York, Maltz was educated at Columbia University, where he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity and the class of 1930, and the Yale School of Drama. He became a communist in 1935 out of conviction, later telling an interviewer: \"I also read the Marxist classics. I still think it to be the noblest set of ideals ever penned by man... Where else in political literature do you find thinkers saying that we were going to end all forms of human exploitation? Wage exploitation, exploitation of women by men, the exploitation of people of colour by white peoples, the exploitation of colonial countries by imperialist countries. And Marx spoke of the fact that socialism will be the kingdom of freedom, where man realizes himself in a way that humankind has never seen before. This was an inspiring body of literature to read.\" Although Maltz later learned of and criticized Soviet repression, one 2009 analysis maintains, \"he remained sympathetic to the anti-fascism of both the Soviet Union and the CPUSA during the 1930s,\" saying in a 1983 interview \"the Communist party in the United States was leading the educational and organizational struggle.\"\n\nIn February 1946 Maltz published an article (written in October 1945) for \"The New Masses\" titled \"What Shall We Ask of Writers?\" in which he criticized fellow Communist writers for producing lower-quality work, owing to their placing political concerns above artistic ones. He also referred positively in his article to the work of James T. Farrell, a Trotskyist. \nThis article brought upon Maltz venomous attacks from fellow CPUSA members, both in print and in person at party meetings. He was accused of \"Browderism\" and in order to retain his good standing with the party he had to humiliate himself by publishing in the \"Daily Worker\" a rebuttal of his own article. Furthermore, he \"publicly denounced himself onstage at a writer's symposium chaired by party members.\"\n\nNearly 30 years after Maltz's death, the 'Albert Maltz Affair' still was a subject of discussion among scholars of Marxist movements and of the Hollywood Ten. John Sbardellati of the University of Waterloo argued in the journal \"Cold War History\" that \"by reigning [sic] in Albert Maltz, the Party rejected its earlier, more accommodating approach to popular culture, and in doing so, unwittingly forfeited a large measure of its cultural influence\" and that this shift contributed to the rapid decline of \"social problem films\" that had emerged early in the post-war era (p. 489). Writing in the \"Journal of American Studies\", Colin Burnett argues, \"The immediate attacks on Maltz by critics like Mike Gold were motivated primarily by the view that a properly Marxist aesthetics must follow the Leninist–Zhdanovite theory of 'art as a weapon',\" though Burnett proposes \"a reexamination of the 'para-Marxist' theory of art [Maltz] developed to clarify the role of leftist criticism and the 'citizen writer' ... in light of debates about art and literature in the journal \"New Masses\" (1926–48), as well as in international Marxist aesthetics.\"\n\nDuring the 1930s, Maltz worked as a playwright for the Theater Union, which was \"an organization of theater artists and [pro-Communist] political activists who mounted professional productions of plays oriented towards working people and their middle-class allies.\" In 1932, his play \"Merry Go Round\" was adapted for a film. At the Theater Union he met Margaret Larkin (1899–1967), whom he married in 1937. He won the O. Henry Award twice: in 1938 for \"The Happiest Man on Earth\", a short story published in \"Harper's Magazine\", and in 1941 for \"Afternoon in the Jungle\", published in \"The New Yorker\". His collection of short fiction \"The Way Things Are, and Other Stories\" was published in 1938, as was his novella \"Seasons of Celebration\", included in \"The Flying Yorkshireman and Other Novellas\", a multi-author compilation released as a May 1938 Book of the Month Club selection. These writings and his 1940 novel \"The Underground Stream\" are considered works of proletarian literature. During this time, Maltz's play \"Private Hicks\" appeared in William Kozlenko's 1939 curated collection \"The Best Short Plays of the Social Theater\", along with such plays as Clifford Odets' \"Waiting for Lefty\", \"The Cradle Will Rock\" by Marc Blitzstein, and \"The Dog Beneath the Skin\" by W.H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood.\n\nIn 1944 he published the novel \"The Cross and the Arrow\", about which Jerry Belcher noted that it was \"a best seller chronicling German resistance to the Nazi regime. It was distributed in a special Armed Services Edition to more than 150,000 American fighting men during World War II.\" In 1970 he published a new collection of short stories \"Afternoon in the Jungle\".\n\nWhile still pursuing his career as a writer of published fiction and stage drama, he branched out into writing for the screen. After working on Casablanca, Maltz's first screenwriting credit was for \"This Gun for Hire\" (1942). For his script for the 1945 film \"Pride of the Marines\", Maltz was nominated for an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. During this period, he also received two Academy Awards for documentary or documentary-style films: the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1942 for \"The Defeat of German Armies Near Moscow\" and a special Oscar in 1945 for \"The House I Live In\", a 10-minute film with singer-actor Frank Sinatra opposing anti-Semitism through the use of a staged incident of young bullies chasing a Jewish boy, prompting Sinatra to speak and sing about why such behavior is wrong.\n\nIn 1947 Maltz became one of the Hollywood Ten, who refused to answer questions before the House Un-American Activities Committee about their Communist Party membership. On the day that Maltz appeared before the committee, October 28, 1947, he and fellow writers Dalton Trumbo and Alvah Bessie not only refused to answer the committee's central question, but also \"challenged the committee's constitutionality and berated its activities,\" according to a reporter for \"The Dallas Morning News\" Washington Bureau. For refusing to respond, each was cited for contempt by Congress, sentenced to jail and fined, although Maltz was the only one in the group whose citation was made the subject of a record vote (a decision in which each member's vote is recorded by name), approved 346 to 17; Trumbo's citation was part of a standing vote (votes counted but not individually named), 240 to 15, and the remaining eight were cited via voice vote. When the jail sentences and fines were finalized, June 29, 1950, \"maximum sentences of a year in jail and $1,000 fine were imposed on Ring Lardner Jr., Lester Cole, Maltz, and Bessie\", while Herbert Biberman and Edward Dmytryk received equal fines but six-month jail sentences; four additional members were set for later punishment.\n\nLike the others, Maltz was blacklisted by studio executives, beginning with an announcement from the president of the Motion Picture Association of America that fifty of the field's top executives had met for two days and decided to drop all ten men from their payrolls, to hire \"no known Communists\" in future, and to refuse to rehire any of the blacklisted men \"until he is acquitted or has purged himself of contempt and declared under oath that he is not a Communist.\" Work that debuted between the 1947 citation and 1950 assignment of sentence received some attention — almost exactly one year after his contempt citation, a \"Film Daily\" critics' poll named his \"The Naked City\" one of the top five screenplays of the 1947-48 season — but once jailed and fined, Maltz struggled to get work or credit. His screenplay for \"Broken Arrow\" won the 1951 Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Western. However, due to his blacklisting at the time, fellow MPAA screenwriter Michael Blankfort agreed to put his own name on the script in place of Maltz's as the only way to get it accepted by any of the Hollywood movie studios, and as such, Blankfort was named the winner. His last assignment for some years was \"The Robe\" (1953), although he didn't receive a credit until decades later.\n\nDuring the early years of the blacklisting, Maltz continued as a published writer of fiction. A 1949 Frank X. Tolbert review of Maltz's \"The Journey of Simon McKeever\" notes that the author's notoriety likely will lead the book to be \"read keenly and even X-rayed to see if it might furnish a clue to the question the writer wouldn't answer.\" Praising the novel as a \"beautiful\" novel and \"an eloquent criticism of the way we treat our old people\" in the form of a \"stream of consciousness story about a few days in the life of a 73-year-old arthritic in a rest home on a $60 pension,\" a man who \"has made good wages all his life\" but is \"too generous to have saved any money,\" living in an old-age home Tolbert describes as \"like something Charles Dickens would have cooked up if he were a twentieth-century author\" — Tolbert concludes that \"if [this book] is 'un-American' in its philosophy, then so are the doctrines of old Doc Townsend and most of the other pension planners.\"\n\nIn 1960, years after appearing in \"The House I Live In\", Sinatra engaged him to write a screenplay for \"The Execution of Private Slovik\". The decision led to considerable public pressure on Sinatra, including an incident in which popular conservative actor John Wayne publicly challenged presidential hopeful John F. Kennedy, then a senator for Massachusetts, as to whether he approved of his \"crony\" Sinatra's choice, stating that Kennedy's opinion mattered \"because Mr. Kennedy is the one who is making plans to run the administrative government of our country.\" In the same article, Ward Bond disparaged Sinatra and others who employed blacklisted writers as \"members of the recent trend of what might be called a 'Hire the Commies' Club.\" Sinatra initially parried attempts to persuade him to fire Maltz, stating that the writer was hired \"because he was the best man for the job — it had nothing to do with his politics,\", but in the end Sinatra was pressured into dismissing Maltz from the project, with columnist Dorothy Kilgallen crediting chiefly the intervention of Kennedy's father, Joe — \"unquestionably anti-Communist, Dad Kennedy would have invited Frank to jump off the Jack Kennedy presidential bandwagon if he hadn't unloaded Maltz\" —, although she also noted that Col. Parker \"was on the verge of pulling Elvis off the upcoming Sinatra spectacular if there was any chance of guilt by association.\"\n\nMaltz and other members of the Hollywood Ten attempted again in 1960 to fight the blacklist, this time by filing an anti-trust suit claiming the studios had conspired illicitly in restraint of trade by enforcing the unofficial blacklist through mutual pressure not to employ the affected creative personnel. Coverage of the suit noted that the plaintiffs \"include three winners of Oscars, the highest artistic award of the movie industry\" — at least two of which were won for pseudonymous writing (\"The Defiant Ones\" and \"Inherit the Wind\" are named) — and that while use of the anti-trust laws for civil rights suits was \"unusual,\" it was \"not unique.\"\n\nMaltz was finally employed again on \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" (1970), which was a vehicle for the popular actors Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine. He worked on additional screenwriting projects in his later years, not all of which came to fruition; a 1972 article on Martin Rackin notes his intention to film a Modigliani biography he co-wrote with Maltz, while a 1978 Henry Fonda profile indicates his plans to revive a script of Maltz's \"The Journey of Simon McKeever\", previously set to star Walter Huston but shelved due to the blacklist, then revived for Spencer Tracy but abandoned when the star died before shooting began. Fonda said in a separate interview, \"When it was brought to me, I fell in love with the story. Jane heard me talking enthusiastically about it, and she asked to read the script. 'Dad, I'd like to play the doctor'... you know she must like it, because her role is small — she'll work only four days.\" Although the project at that time had advanced to the point that filming locations convenient to Henry Fonda's beekeeping hobby had been identified, the film never was made. Maltz's last writing credit (as John B. Sherry) is for \"Hangup\" (1974).\nIn 1991, in the course of correcting screen credits for blacklisted screenwriters, the Writers Guild of America officially recognized Maltz as the only credited screenwriter for \"Broken Arrow\". The guild's vote was unanimous.\n\nOne of Maltz's literary agents was Maxim Lieber, whom he visited in Warsaw, Poland, after Lieber fled the States in 1950. Maltz referred to him as \"my friend and former agent.\" In his later years, Maltz reached out to others outside the United States, once offering to take any royalties owed him by the Soviet Union and give them to Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to alleviate the dire conditions then being imposed on him by the USSR. Solzhenitsyn expressed his appreciation via the press, observing that Soviet authorities were unlikely to allow him to accept the offer and disputing Soviet cultural minister Furtseva's claims that the Russian author was \"well off and has bought more than one car,\" insisting instead that for the seven years previous the Soviet government had denied him both money and housing, such that, \"My only car, which I had been using for nine years, was sold to prolong my existence and I have not gotten any other car.\"\n\nMaltz died April 26, 1985, at the age of 76 from complications from a stroke he'd suffered nine months before. In an interview given a few weeks after Maltz's death, actor Kirk Douglas — who claimed to have broken the blacklist by publicly hiring Trumbo in 1959 to improve the \"Spartacus\" script — said of the 10, \"I felt badly about those people. They weren't trying to overthrow their government. I didn't share their beliefs, any more than I am in sympathy with the opinions of Vanessa Redgrave. But I support her suit against the Boston Symphony [for cancelling 1982 performances based on Redgrave's support of the Palestine Liberation Organization]. That's a blacklist.\"\n\nIn Jay Roach's \"Trumbo\", Maltz is part of a composite character, Arlen Hird (Louis C.K.).\n\n\nThis filmography is based on the Internet Movie Database listings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079037", "title": "Armadillo World Headquarters", "text": "Armadillo World Headquarters\n\nArmadillo World Headquarters (sometimes called simply The 'Dillo) was a music venue and nightclub in Austin, Texas, from 1970 to 1980. It was located at 505 Barton Springs Road in Austin. After its demolition, it was replaced by a 13-story office building.\n\nIn 1970, Austin's flagship rock music venue, the Vulcan Gas Company, closed, leaving the city's nascent live music scene without an incubator. One night, Eddie Wilson, manager of the local group Shiva's Headband, stepped outside a nightclub where the band was playing and noticed an old, abandoned National Guard armory. Wilson found an unlocked garage door on the building and was able to view the cavernous interior using the headlights of his automobile. He had a desire to continue the legacy of the Vulcan Gas Company, and was inspired by what he saw in the armory to create a new music hall in the derelict structure. The armory was estimated to have been built in 1948, but no records of its construction could be located. The building was ugly, uncomfortable, and had poor acoustics, but offered cheap rent and a central location. Posters for the venue usually noted the address as 525½ Barton Springs Road (Rear), behind the Skating Palace (approximate coordinates 30.258 −97.750).\n\nThe name for the Armadillo was inspired by the use of armadillos as a symbol in the artwork of Jim Franklin, a local poster artist, and from the building itself. In choosing the mascot for the new venture, Wilson and his partners wanted an \"armored\" animal since the building was an old armory. The nine-banded armadillo (\"Dasypus novemcinctus\") was chosen because of its hard shell that looks like armor, its history as a survivor (virtually unchanged for 50 million years), and its near-ubiquity in Central Texas. Wilson also believed the building looked like it had been some type of headquarters at one time. He initially proposed \"International Headquarters\" but in the end it became \"World Headquarters.\"\n\nIn founding the Armadillo World Headquarters, Wilson was assisted by Jim Franklin, Mike Tolleson, an entertainment attorney, Bobby Hedderman from the Vulcan Gas Company and Hank Alrich. Funding for the venture was initially provided by Shiva's Headband founder's father, Dan Perskin, and Mad Dog, Inc. an Austin literati group that included Bud Shrake.\n\nThe Armadillo World Headquarters officially opened on August 7, 1970 with Shiva's Headband, the Hub City Movers, and Whistler performing. The hall held about 1,500 patrons, but chairs were limited, so most patrons sat on the floor on sections of carpet that had been pieced together.\nThe Armadillo caught on quickly with the hippie culture of Austin because admission was inexpensive and the hall tolerated cannabis use. Even though illicit drug use was flagrant, the Armadillo was never raided. Anecdotes suggest the police were worried about having to bust their fellow officers as well as local and state politicians.\nSoon, the Armadillo started receiving publicity in national magazines such as \"Rolling Stone\". In a story from its September 9, 1974 edition, \"Time magazine\" wrote that the Armadillo was to the Austin music scene what The Fillmore had been to the emergence of rock music in the 1960s. The clientele became a mixture of hippies, cowboys, and businessmen who stopped by to have lunch and a beer and listen to live music. At its peak, the amount of Lone Star draft beer sold by the Armadillo was second only to the Houston Astrodome. The Neiman Marcus department store even offered a line of Armadillo-branded products.\n\nThe unique blend of country and rock music performed at the hall became known by the terms \"The Austin Sound,\" \"Redneck Rock,\" progressive country or \"Cosmic Cowboy.\" Artists that almost single-handedly defined this particular genre and sound were Michael Martin Murphey, Jerry Jeff Walker and The Lost Gonzo Band. Many upcoming and established acts such as Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Ray Charles, Stevie Ray Vaughan and ZZ Top played the Armadillo. Freddy Fender, Freddie King, Frank Zappa, Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, The Sir Douglas Quintet all recorded live albums there. Bruce Springsteen played five shows during 1974. The Australian band AC/DC played their first American show at the Armadillo with Canadian band Moxy in July 1977. The Clash played live at The Armadillo with Joe Ely on October 4, 1979 (a photo from that show appears on the band's \"London Calling\" album) and the Austin punk band The Skunks.\n\nDespite its successes, the Armadillo always struggled financially. The addition of the Armadillo Beer Garden in 1972 and the subsequent establishment of food service were both bids to generate steady cash flow. However, the financial difficulties continued. In an interview for the 2010 book Weird City, Eddie Wilson remarked:\n\n\"\"People don’t remember this part: the months and months of drudgery. People talk about the Armadillo like it was a huge success, but there were months where hardly anyone showed up. After the first night when no one really came I ended up crying myself to sleep up on stage.\"\"\n\nThis predicament was blamed on a combination of large guaranteed payments for the acts, cheap ticket prices, and poor promotion. The club finally had to lay off staff members in late 1976 and file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1977. Another factor in the club's demise was that it sat on of land in what soon became a prime development area in the rapidly growing city. The Armadillo's landlord sold the property for an amount estimated between $4 million and $8 million.\n\nThe final concert at the Armadillo took place on December 31, 1980. The sold-out New Year's Eve show featured Asleep at the Wheel and Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen. Some reports say the show ended at 4 am, while others claim that the bands played until dawn. The contents of the Armadillo were sold at auction in January 1981, and the old armory was razed for a high-rise office building.\n\nWith the success of the Armadillo and Austin's burgeoning music scene, KLRN (now KLRU), the local PBS television affiliate, created \"Austin City Limits\", a program showcasing popular local, regional, and national music acts.\n\nThe Armadillo Christmas Bazaar began in 1976 at the Armadillo, and is still held annually during the Christmas season. The Bazaar was another attempt to improve cash flow for the hall. When the Armadillo closed, the Bazaar first moved to Cherry Creek Plaza (1981–1983), and then on to the Austin Opry House (1984–1994). In 1995, the Bazaar settled at the Austin Music Hall for twelve years. Due to remodeling of the Austin Music Hall, the Bazaar had to move its 2007 show to the Austin Convention Center and is currently at the Palmer Events Center. The Bazaar has become one of the top-ranked arts and crafts shows in the nation with a long waiting list of artisans who wish to show their work.\n\nOn August 19, 2006, the City of Austin dedicated a commemorative plaque at the site where the Armadillo once stood. Co-founder Eddie Wilson was on hand and stated: \"\"It is still on the lips and minds of a lot of people 26 years after it closed. This is noteworthy for me because of the zero-tolerance mentality, and now the city erected a memorial that glorifies the things of the past that are not accepted today.\"\" \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079038", "title": "The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)", "text": "The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel is a musical with music by Frank Wildhorn and lyrics and book by Nan Knighton, based on the novel of the same name by Baroness Orczy. The show is set in England and France during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. The story is a precursor to the spy fiction and the superhero genres, where a hero hides under a mild-mannered alias.\n\nThe musical ran on Broadway from 1997 through January 2000 in several theatres, in several revised versions. It also had a US National tour.\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" started as a workshop with Carolee Carmello as Marguerite and directed by Nick Corley, following a concept album (and Top 40 Adult Contemporary Hit - \"You Are My Home\").\n\nThe musical debuted on Broadway at the Minskoff Theatre on October 7, 1997 in previews, officially on November 9, 1997. Directed by Peter H. Hunt, it starred Douglas Sills (Sir Percy Blakeney), Christine Andreas (Marguerite St. Just), Terrance Mann (Citizen Chauvelin), Marine Jahan (Madame St. Cyr), Tim Shew (St. Cyr), Elizabeth Ward (Marie), Philip Hoffman (Tussaud), James Judy (Dewhurst), Sandy Rosenberg (Lady Digby), Pamela Burrell (Lady Llewellyn), Gilles Chiasson (Armand St. Just), Ed Dixon (Ozzy), Allen Fitzpatrick (Farleigh), Bill Bowers (Leggett), Adam Pelty (Elton), Ron Sharpe (Hal), William Thomas Evans (Hastings), Dave Clemmons (Ben), R.F. Daley (Neville), David Cromwell (Robespierre/Prince of Wales/Fisherman), Ken Labey (Grappin), Eric Bennyhoff (Coupeau), Jeff Gardner (Mercier), James Dybas (Jessup), Melissa Hart (Helene), and Alison Lory (Chloe).\n\nIn June shortly before the Tony Awards were announced, the show was slated to close. The show's fans known as \"The League\" decided it should have another try. With falling ticket sales, the show ushered in new producers and reopened with Sills and two new leads, Rex Smith and Rachel York and a vastly rearranged production in October 1998 (a year after the previous opening). The show closed at the Minskoff Theatre on May 30, 1999. It had a mini-tour of a scaled-down version in the Summer of 1999 with three new leads. The revised version (called the 3.0 version) opened on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on September 7, 1999, closing on January 2, 2000 for a grand total of 772 performances and 39 previews. The cast starred Ron Bohmer, Marc Kudisch and Carolee Carmello. Like Wildhorn's two other big budget Broadway efforts (\"Jekyll & Hyde\" and \"The Civil War\"), the musical closed having lost money.\n\nA US National tour began on February 20, 2000, through April 1, 2001, directed and choreographed by Robert Longbottom with Douglas Sills re-creating his role and with Amy Bodnar as Marguerite and William Paul Michals as Chauvelin. Sills was replaced by Robert Patteri and finally Ron Bohmer.\n\nThe musical has had numerous regional US productions and has been produced in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, Mexico, Malta, and Norway, among others.\n\nIt has also been produced by the Japanese Takarazuka Revue, which had previously commissioned \"Never Say Goodbye\" from Frank Wildhorn in 2006, under the guidance of Wildhorn himself. Wildhorn also penned two additional songs exclusively for the Takarazuka production of the show, \"A Piece of Courage\" and \"Days of Glory\". The show ran from June to October 2008 and was performed by the group's Star Troupe. It starred Kei Aran as Percy, Asuka Tono as Marguerite, and Reon Yuzuki as Chauvelin. It was performed again by the Revue from April to June 2010, this time by the Moon Troupe. Hiromu Kiriya and Yuki Aono starred as Percy and Marguerite, respectively, with Masaki Ryuu and Rio Asumi double-cast as Chauvelin. It was then again performed by the Star Troupe, from March to June 2017, starring Yuzuru Kurenai as Percy, Airi Kisaki as Marguerite and Makoto Rei as Chauvelin.\n\nThe show was also produced in Mexico City by Bernstein-Peralta Productions. It opened at Teatro Nextel del Parque on November 27, 2014 and closed on December 16, 2014. It ran for 16 performances including 1 preview. It was directed by Ricardo Diaz and the cast featured Irasema Terrazas, Luis Rene Aguirre, Yolanda Orrantia and Efrain Berry.\n\nIn October 2015 on an airing of \"Frank Wildhorn & Friends\" on PBS's 66th & Broadway, Wildhorn announced the musical has been in talks to be revived again in the next years.\n\nThe following is the current version, The Scarlet Pimpernel 4.0.\n\nThe play opens at La Comédie Française, an elegant theatre where Marguerite St. Just is performing in her final show (\"Storybook\"). As she announces to the crowd her marriage to wealthy English aristocrat Sir Percy Blakeney, Citizen Chauvelin, a fanatical agent of the French republican revolutionaries, closes the theatre before the performance is finished. Percy, Marguerite, and her brother, Armand, leave for England, and Chauvelin oversees the execution of the Marquis de St.-Cyr by guillotine in the miserable streets of Paris (\"Madame Guillotine\").\n\nPercy and Marguerite wed in England (\"Believe\"). However, on the night of their wedding, Percy learns that his wife betrayed the Marquis de St.-Cyr, his friend, to the revolutionary government (\"Wedding Dance\"). Heartbroken, Percy is torn between his love for Marguerite and the knowledge of what she has done (\"Prayer\"). The Blakeneys' marriage grows cold.\n\nPercy determines to make amends for his friend's death by saving other innocents from the guillotine. He takes on the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel and convinces some of his friends (subsequently called \"bounders\") to join him in his daring rescue attempts; Armand, Marguerite's brother, insists on being included (\"Into the Fire\"). The band pretend to be inane fops, effectively throwing off any suspicions about the identity of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Under Percy's strict orders, Marguerite is told nothing of this.\n\nOver the next five weeks, the League rescues many potential victims of the guillotine in Paris (\"The Rescue\"). The furious Robespierre orders Chauvelin to discover the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel with the help of a Belgian spy named Grappin (Percy in disguise). Frustrated, Chauvelin vows to succeed (\"Falcon in the Dive\").\n\nBack in England, Marie, Marguerite's old costume designer and best friend, has come to the Blakeney estate and is painting Percy's portrait. The Blakeneys' maids gossip about the Scarlet Pimpernel with Percy, who continues his foppish act (\"Scarlet Pimpernel Transition\"). Marguerite cannot understand how Percy is so drastically different from the man whom she married (\"When I Look At You\").\n\nInformed that she has a visitor in the garden, Marguerite goes outside. Percy looks out at her in awe, yet remains confused about how he should act around her (\"When I Look At You (Reprise)\"). Marguerite's visitor turns out to be Chauvelin, who attempts to convince her to join him in his mission to unmask the Pimpernel, as the French believe he is a member of the Blakeney's circle. Percy joins the conversation and perplexes Chauvelin with his ridiculous ways. When Percy leaves, Chauvelin tries to remind Marguerite of the fiery passion they once shared for the Revolution and each other (\"Where's the Girl?\"). Marguerite rejects Chauvelin's advances and sends him away.\n\nArmand, just returned from a trip for the League, tells Marguerite that he is going on another trip, this time to France. She becomes upset because she believes that Armand is putting himself in danger—and because he is the only one whom Marguerite feels truly loves her. Marguerite begs Armand to stay, but after trying to comfort her, he leaves, taking Marie back to Paris with him to assist the League (\"You Are My Home\").\n\nPercy tells his remaining men that the Prince of Wales, suspicious of their trips to France, wants to meet with them. To allay the Prince's suspicions, Percy shows the League how it is a man's duty to dress elegantly and flamboyantly, and they all display the latest fashion (\"The Creation of Man\"). At the palace, the League convinces the Prince that they have nothing to do with the Pimpernel's activities.\n\nChauvelin arrives to meet with the Prince but is brushed aside so that the League can help the Prince select his attire for the royal ball that night. Having received a note from Chauvelin, Marguerite meets him at the palace, and Chauvelin once again enlists her aid. Armand has been captured in France, and Chauvelin threatens to have him guillotined if Marguerite refuses to help find the Pimpernel (\"Marguerite's Dilemma (Instrumental)\"). Both Marguerite and Chauvelin wonder if they can trust each other; Percy finds them talking and wonders if he, too, can trust his wife (\"The Riddle\").\n\nAt the Prince's ball (\"Entr'acte (Instrumental)\"), Percy and the other guests discuss the Pimpernel, who they all know is there that evening (\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\"). Percy then recites a poem he has created in honor of the Pimpernel, and the guests join in (\"They Seek Him Here\").\n\nMarguerite, desperate, convinces one of Percy's men to ask the Pimpernel to meet her on the footbridge at one o'clock (\"The Gavotte\"). She informs Chauvelin of the plan and goes to the footbridge. Percy comes but remains hidden in the shadows, keeping his identity concealed. Marguerite tells him of Chauvelin's plans and explains that she betrayed the Marquis de St.-Cyr under coercion. Torn, Marguerite begs the Pimpernel to escape before Chauvelin arrives, but the Pimpernel promises to save Armand and sends Marguerite away. Overjoyed, Percy now understands why he has loved Marguerite all along—and that she has always remained the same (\"She Was There\"). Chauvelin arrives, but Percy's antics fluster him into leaving without discovering the Pimpernel's identity. The League then sets out for France to save Armand.\n\nStill unaware of the Pimpernel's identity, Marguerite does the same. Disguised as a tart, Marguerite attempts to uncover information about her brother, but she is quickly recognized and apprehended by Chauvelin (\"Storybook (Reprise)\"). While Chauvelin admires Marguerite's courageous efforts, he is angry that she was defying his threats, and he sends her to prison with Armand.\n\nUnable to get access to Marguerite and Armand, Grappin poses a plot to Chauvelin to have Armand lead them to the secret harbor that the League uses, where they can capture the entire group. Grappin tries to convince Chauvelin to let him dispose of Marguerite, but Chauvelin orders him to stick to the plan. Alone, Chauvelin rages over his failure to win Marguerite back (\"Where's the Girl? (Reprise)\").\n\nThe League meets with Percy, Marie, and Tussaud (Marie's fiancé) in Paris to try to find a way to save Marguerite and Armand. Unable to get close to them, even disguised as Grappin, Percy starts to think the situation is almost hopeless. He vows to go it alone, not wanting the rest of the League to continue to risk themselves, but they reassuredly state they will stand by him (\"Into the Fire (Reprise)\").\n\nIn prison, Armand assures Marguerite that the Pimpernel will save them. Refusing to believe it, Marguerite mourns the loss of Percy and of her life (\"I'll Forget You\"). However, the two are \"rescued\" by \"League members\" and set off for the League's harbor at the coastal town of Michelon, having no idea that Chauvelin is on their trail. On the way, Marguerite learns her husband's secret identity.\n\nAt Michelon, Marguerite and Armand discover that a guillotine has been erected at the harbour. Chauvelin and his soldiers arrive, and when Marguerite desperately calls for Percy to run, Chauvelin finally begins to suspect who his adversary truly is.\n\nGrappin turns up and informs Chauvelin that the Pimpernel—who Grappin confirms is Sir Percy Blakeney—is heading for Calais. Chauvelin sends some of his men off to intercept the Pimpernel but still keeps soldiers to assist him. When Percy \"accidentally\" lets his identity slip, he and Chauvelin duel. Marguerite steps in several times to help Percy, but Chauvelin still wins (\"The Duel\"). Percy is then immediately guillotined.\n\nConfident in his triumph, Chauvelin sends most of his remaining soldiers away to carry the news to Robespierre, leaving only a small squad. However, to Chauvelin's utter bewilderment, Percy stands up from the guillotine unharmed. The head that fell is, in fact, a wax one that Marie (who, having married Tussaud, is revealed to be Marie Tussaud) created to fool Chauvelin. The whole duel and execution was but a ruse to lull Chauvelin into a sense of overconfidence and send the majority of his forces away. The remaining soldiers turn out to be the League in disguise.\n\nPercy's men tie up Chauvelin and leave him with planted evidence incriminating him as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Percy, Marguerite, Armand, and the bounders then set off for England. Marguerite and Percy confide in each other the true love that they have always had for each other (\"Believe (Reprise)\").\n\n\n(**) five principal vocal parts <br>\n(*) eight sub-principal vocal parts\n\nAct I\n\nAct II\nHowever, changes were made to the song list after a number of previews on Broadway:\nAct I\n\nAct II\n"}

It was the last title developed by Imagitec for the Jaguar before the company ended their relationship with Atari Corp., who would discontinue the platform in April 1996.\n\nWhen the databases of the Override mainframe supercomputer began mutating and blocking the I-Way computer network, the player is tasked in piloting an antivirus tank vehicle and enter into the virtual world to clear out the network, eliminate computer viruses and eradicate the mutated databases. The game was originally announced in late 1994 under a different title.\n\n\"I-War\" received mixed to negative reception when it was originally released.\n\n\"I-War\" is a shooter game that is primarily played in a first-person perspective, where the player takes control of an antivirus tank vehicle in order to enter into the virtual world of a worldwide computer network nicknamed \"I-Way\" and fight computer viruses, in addition of destroying mutated databases and collect datapods as main objectives through 21 different levels, each one increasing in scope and complexity as the player progresses through the game, with later levels introducing new enemy types and weapons that can be equipped for the player's tank. Before starting the game, the player has the option to choose between three different types of tanks, with each having their own advantages and disadvantages. There are three difficulty levels that the player can choose at the options menu, while other settings are available by entering a cheat code. There is also a two-player versus mode.\n\nDuring gameplay, the player can change the camera angles by pressing their respective number on the controller's keypad, in addition of activating a level map and other features. Unlike other games in the genre that were released for the system such as \"Cybermorph\" and \"Hover Strike\", the levels in \"I-War\" are sorted into enclosed chambers with one-way teleportation in order to avoid repeating levels. Once the set number of mutated databases are destroyed and collecting the number of datapods within the respective level, the player has to come back to the starting point and enter into the Data Link bonus rounds, which involves grabbing datapods in an attempt to gain an extra life by either increasing or decreasing the tank's speed, while also acting as transition points to upper levels. After completing the level, the player can choose to save or not their progress, which is kept via the cartridge's internal EEPROM, while high-scores and other setting changes are automatically saved internally. If all lives are lost, the game is over.\n\nIn the future and after 20 years of being in development, the Override mainframe supercomputer, which is buried on the South Pole in order to keep its core at very low temperatures from overheating, went online on schedule and its main function is to handle information of the ever-increasingly complex internet, called I-Way, through advanced processing capabilities that the technology inside of the supercomputer offers and as such, society started depending on it and worked for years without exhibiting issues until its databases started mutating and computer viruses began to clog the I-Way, leading to delays, slow information transfers, among other issues that brings the Override to the point of self-destruction as a result of the now-mutated databases. In response to the situation, the player is assigned to pilot an antivirus tank vehicle in order to destroy mutated databases and viruses that are clogging the I-Way, in addition of collecing datapods. After traversing multiple nodes, the player finally arrives to the Override Central Block and destroys the boss database by overloading it with viruses, saving I-Way in the process until next time.\n\n\"I-War\" was originally advertised under the name \"Redemption\" in late 1994 and was also known internally as \"Dreadnaught\", with plans to be originally released around the second quarter of 1995. The music was composed by Alastair Lindsay. Development of the game was completed on December 11, 1995, a few days before release. It was the last title produced by Imagitec Design for the Jaguar, as the developer started having issues with Atari during this period. The game was showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari.\n\n\"I-War\" received mixed to negative reception since its release.\n\nIn 1997, two years after its release, the game's trademark was abandoned.\n\n"}

A former editor of the \"London Evening Standard\", she became editor of the \"Today\" programme on BBC Radio 4 in 2017.\n\nSands was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent in 1961, to parents in the Colonial Service. Sands is the younger sister of Kit Hesketh-Harvey (of musical duo Kit and The Widow). She was educated at Kent College, Pembury (then a Methodist, now interdenominational) independent day and boarding school for girls. She later attended Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\nSands trained on \"The Sevenoaks Chronicle\" as a news reporter, before moving to the \"Evening Standard\", initially as editor of the Londoner's Diary, before taking further posts as features editor and associate editor. She joined \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 1996 as deputy editor, under Charles Moore, later assuming responsibility for the Saturday edition.\n\nSands was appointed the first female editor of \"The Sunday Telegraph\" in June 2005, succeeding Dominic Lawson. Her plan for the November 2005 relaunch of the paper was that it should be \"like an iPod – full of your favourite things\". However the makeover was not well regarded by senior management and in an abrupt move, after just eight months and 20 days in post, Sands was sacked as editor of the newspaper on 7 March 2006 by Andrew Neil and replaced by Patience Wheatcroft. Subsequently, many of her changes under her editorship were reversed (including changes to the title font).\n\nIn April 2006, Sands was appointed consultant editor on the \"Daily Mail\".\n\nIn August 2006, Sands wrote an article about the emo musical genre, which stated that Green Day and My Chemical Romance encourage self-harm among teenagers. Upon hearing about this article while on tour in the UK, My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way led a chant of \"fuck the \"Daily Mail\"\" (as Sands's article ran in this newspaper) during one of their live shows. \"Kerrang!\" magazine, in particular, took offence at the article.\n\nIn February 2008 she was appointed editor-in-chief of the UK edition of \"Reader's Digest\". In February 2009 it was announced that she would be taking up the role of deputy editor on \"London Evening Standard\". She became editor of the \"London Evening Standard\" following Geordie Greig's departure for \"The Mail on Sunday\" in March 2012.\n\nIn January 2017, she was appointed editor of the BBC Radio 4 \"Today\" programme and took up her appointment later in the year. Sands resigned from the post in late January 2020, the day after major cuts to BBC News were announced. She is not due to leave the programme until September.\n\nSands has written three novels: \"Playing the Game\" (2003), \"Hothouse\" (2005) and \"The Villa\" (2006).\n\nSands's first marriage was to the actor Julian Sands, with whom she had a son. Her second marriage was to Kim Fletcher, a former editorial director of the Telegraph group and editor of \"The Independent on Sunday\", with whom she has two children.\n"}

Traditional PSTN phones are used as VoIP phones with analog telephone adapters (ATA).\n\nA VoIP phone or application may have many features an analog phone doesn't support, such as e-mail-like IDs for contacts that may be easier to remember than names or phone numbers, or easy sharing of contact lists among multiple accounts. Generally the features of VoIP phones follow those of Skype and other PC-based phone services, which have richer feature sets but (because they rely on mainstream operating systems' IP support) latency-related audio problems.\n\nAs mainstream operating systems became better at voice applications with appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees and 5G handoff (IEEE 802.21 etc.) becomes available from wireless carriers, tablets and smartphones became the dominant interfaces. iPhone, Android and the QNX OS used in 2012-and-later BlackBerry phones are widely capable of VoIP performance. They also typically support the USB but not Ethernet or Power over Ethernet interfaces. The smartphone became the dominant VoIP phone because it works both indoors and outdoors and shifts base stations/protocols easily to trade off access costs and call clarity and other factors personal to the user, and the PoE/USB VoIP phone was thus the transitional device.\n\nA VoIP telephone consist of the hardware and software components. \nThe software requires standard networking components such as a TCP/IP network stack, client implementation for DHCP, and the Domain Name System (DNS).\nIn addition, a VoIP signalling protocol stack, such as for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Skinny Call Control Protocol (Cisco), and Skype, is needed.\nFor media streams, the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in most VoIP systems. For voice and media encoding, a variety of coders are available, such as for audio: G.711, GSM, iLBC, Speex, G.729, G.722, G.722.2 (AMR-WB), other audio codecs, and for video H.263, H.263+, H.264. User interface software controls the operation of the hardware components, and may respond to user actions with messages to a display screen.\n\nTo enable the VoIP communications, the SIP/RTP packets should be utilised and STUN client would be the key component for VoIP communications with management of the SIP/RTP packets. \nA Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) client is used on some SIP-based VoIP phones as firewalls on network interface sometimes block SIP/RTP packets. Some special mechanism is required in this case to enable routing of SIP packets from one network to other. STUN is used in some of the sip phones to enable the SIP/RTP packets to cross boundaries of two different IP networks. A packet becomes unroutable between two sip elements if one of the networks uses private IP address range and other is in public IP address range. Stun is a mechanism to enable this border traversal. There are alternate mechanisms for traversal of NAT, STUN is just one of them. STUN or any other NAT traversal mechanism is not required when the two SIP phones connecting are routable from each other and no firewall exists in between.\n\nDHCP client software simplifies connection of a device to an IP network. The software automatically configures the network and VoIP service parameters.\n\nThe overall hardware may look like a telephone or mobile phone. A VoIP phone has the following hardware components\n\nThere are several Wi-Fi enabled mobile phones and PDAs that have pre-installed SIP client software, or are capable of running IP telephony clients, including most smartphones.\n\nAnalog telephone adapters provide an interface for traditional analog telephones to a voice-over-IP network. They connect to the Internet or local area network using an Ethernet port and have jacks that provide a standard RJ11interface for an analog local loop.\n\nAnother type of gateway device acts as a simple GSM base station and regular mobile phones can connect to this and make VoIP calls. While a license is required to run one of these in most countries these can be useful on ships or remote areas where a low-powered gateway transmitting on unused frequencies is likely to go unnoticed.\n\nSome VoIP phones also support PSTN phone lines directly.\n\n\n\n"}

Whale oil from the bowhead whale was sometimes known as train oil, which comes from the Dutch word \"traan\" (\"tear\" or \"drop\").\n\nSperm oil, a special kind of oil obtained from the head cavities of sperm whales, differs chemically from ordinary whale oil: it is composed mostly of liquid wax. Its properties and applications differ from those of regular whale oil, and it sells for a higher price.\n\nEarly industrial societies used whale oil in oil lamps and to make soap. In the 20th century it was made into margarine. With the commercial development of the petroleum industry and vegetable oils, the use of whale oils declined considerably from its peak in the 19th century into the 20th century. In the 21st century, with most countries having banned whaling, the sale and use of whale oil has practically ceased.\n\nWhale oil was obtained by boiling strips of blubber harvested from whales. The removal is known as \"flensing\" and the boiling process was called \"trying out\". The boiling was carried out on land in the case of whales caught close to shore or beached. On longer deep-sea whaling expeditions, the trying-out was done aboard the ship in a furnace known as a trywork and the carcass was then discarded into the water.\n\nBaleen whales were a major source of whale oil. Their oil is exclusively composed of triglycerides, whereas that of toothed whales contains wax esters. The bowhead whale and right whale were considered the ideal whaling targets. They are slow and docile, and they float when killed. They yield plenty of high-quality oil and whalebone, and as a result, they were hunted nearly to extinction.\n\nWhale oil has low viscosity (lower than olive oil), is clear, and varies in color from a bright honey yellow to a dark brown, according to the condition of the blubber from which it has been extracted and the refinement through which it went. It has a strong fishy odor. When hydrogenated, it turns solid and white and its taste and odor change.\n\nThe composition of whale oil varies with the species from which it was sourced and the method by which it was harvested and processed. Whale oil is mainly composed of triglycerides (molecules of fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule). Oil sourced from toothed whales contains a substantial amount of wax esters (especially the oil of sperm whales). Most of the fatty acids are unsaturated. The most common fatty acids are oleic acid and its isomers (18:1 carbon chains).\n\nWhale oil is exceptionally stable.\n\nThe use of whale oil had a steady decline starting in the late 19th century due to the development of superior alternatives, and later, the passing of environmental laws. In 1986, the International Whaling Commission declared a moratorium on commercial whaling, which has all but eliminated the use of whale oil today. The Inuit of North America are granted special whaling rights (justified as being integral to their culture), and they still use whale oil as a food and as lamp oil. See Aboriginal whaling.\n\nWhale oil was used as a cheap illuminant, though it gave off a strong odor when burnt and was not very popular. It was replaced in the late 19th century by cheaper, more efficient, and longer-lasting kerosene. Burning fluid known as camphine was the dominant replacement for whale oil until the arrival of kerosene.\n\nIn the US, whale oil was used in cars as a constituent of automatic transmission fluid until it was banned by the 1973 Endangered Species Act. It was also a major component of tractor hydraulic fluid (like the ubiquitous JDM Type 303 Special Hydraulic Fluid) until its withdrawal in 1974.\n\nIn the UK, whale oil was used in toolmaking machinery as a high-quality lubricant\n\nAfter the invention of hydrogenation in the early 20th century, whale oil was used to make margarine, a practice that has since been discontinued. Whale oil in margarine has been replaced by vegetable oil.\n\nWhale oil was used to make soap. Until the invention of hydrogenation, it was used only in industrial-grade cleansers, because its foul smell and tendency to discolor made it unsuitable for cosmetic soap.\n\nWhale oil was widely used in the First World War as a preventive measure against trench foot. A British infantry battalion on the Western Front could be expected to use 10 gallons of whale oil a day. The oil was rubbed directly onto bare feet in order to protect them from the effects of immersion.\n\nThe pursuit and use of whale oil, along with many other aspects of whaling, are discussed in Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\". In the novel, the preciousness of the substance to contemporary American society is emphasized when the fictional narrator notes that whale oil is \"as rare as the milk of queens.\" John R. Jewitt, an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nootka people on the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1802–1805, describes how whale oil was used as a condiment with every dish, even strawberries.\n\nFriedrich Ratzel in \"The History of Mankind\" (1896), when discussing food materials in Oceania, quoted Captain James Cook's comment in relation to \"the Maoris\" saying \"No Greenlander was ever so sharp set upon train-oil as our friends here, they greedily swallowed the stinking droppings when we were boiling down the fat of dog-fish.\"\n\n"}

After success with Lille OSC, where he scored against Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League, Cheyrou attracted interest from a number of clubs around Europe, most notably Liverpool. Gérard Houllier had the player scouted for several months by scout David Murray before deciding to sign him in the summer of 2002 for £4.5 million (€6.5m).\n\nOn signing him, Houllier dubbed Cheyrou the \"new Zidane\". Unfortunately, over time this tag proved to be a burden as he failed to live up to expectations. His first Liverpool goal came against Spartak Moscow in the Champions League, however this would be his only goal of the 2002–03 season. Despite being left out of Liverpool's squad for the victorious 2003 Football League Cup Final he contributed in the earlier rounds, and was on the pitch as Liverpool secured their place in the final by beating Sheffield United.\n\nA spell of four goals in five games over the Christmas period of the 2003–04 season at one time suggested his Liverpool career may make a turn for the better. Arguably, the highlight of Cheyrou's Liverpool career was the winning goal he scored in the 33rd minute at Chelsea during the 2003–04 season. He only scored once more in the league for Liverpool, in the 1–1 draw at Wolves in January 2004. Three days later Cheyrou had another memorable game for Liverpool in the FA Cup where he scored twice to help Liverpool beat Newcastle 2–1.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2004–05 season, new manager Rafael Benítez deemed Cheyrou surplus to requirements and immediately loaned him to Marseille in a season-long deal. He played 20 times for the club, scoring one goal. In the 2005–06 season, he was once again sent on a season-long loan, this time to Bordeaux, with a view to a permanent move; however, this failed to materialise. Ahead of the following season, he made a permanent move to Rennes and played there for three and a half seasons, scoring some goals. In January 2010 Anorthosis Famagusta signed the midfielder from Stade Rennes. After six months with Anorthosis, the 32-year-old midfielder returned to France and signed a two-year contract for FC Nantes.\n\nCheyrou has been capped three times by the France national team between 2002 and 2004, making his senior international debut on 21 August 2002 in a 1–1 draw against Tunisia.\n\nBruno has a younger brother, Benoît Cheyrou, who played for Toronto FC.

Calleia became a star with the play \"Small Miracle\" (1934), his first real role as a heavy, and he was put under contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nCalleia excelled as the villain in Hollywood films, but he fought against typecasting and created a succession of darkly mysterious characters edged with humor in films including \"Algiers\" (1938), \"Five Came Back\" (1939), \"Golden Boy\" (1939), \"The Glass Key\" (1942) and \"Gilda\" (1946). During World War II Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the US, and toured for the USO and the Hollywood Victory Committee. After the war he continued to work steadily in motion pictures and television, and he starred in the 1948 London stage premiere of Arthur Miller's Tony Award-winning play, \"All My Sons\". Calleia's performance in Orson Welles's 1958 film \"Touch of Evil\" is regarded as one of the best in his career.\n\nJoseph Alexander Caesar Herstall Vincent Calleja was born August 4, 1897, in Notabile (now called Mdina), in the administrative area of Saqqajja, in the Crown Colony of Malta. His parents were Pasquale and Eleonore Calleja; his father was an architect. Calleia studied at St. Julian's and St. Aloysius Colleges. At age 12 he used the English pound given to him for Christmas to buy two dozen harmonicas, and organized a local band whose performances were soon netting £100 a week. Sent by his father to London to study engineering, Calleia employed his good tenor voice in music halls, performing ballads of the Scottish Highlands in traditional dress. He worked as Joseph Spurin, using his mother's maiden name due to his father's disapproval.\n\nIn 1914 Calleia joined the British Transport Service. After cruising the world for two-and-a-half years, his ship was torpedoed in the English Channel. Hospitalized for three months, Calleia was awarded a campaign medal and honorably discharged. He traveled to the United States in 1917. Unemployed, he sang for the Red Cross and armed services, and volunteered for the American Tank Corps.\n\nCalleia began his stage career on Armistice Day. After World War I he found only limited success in vaudeville. He earned his living stoking the furnace at a department store, and got a night job washing and repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the chorus of Jerome Kern's musical comedy \"Have a Heart\". The following season he had a bit part in \"Pietro\" (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour. Calleia supplemented his salary by working as assistant stage manager and repairing trunks at $3 each.\n\nCalleia's first speaking role on the stage was in \"The Broken Wing\" (1920), a Broadway comedy starring George Abbott and Louis Wolheim. He understudied all of the parts and appeared as a Mexican peon who played the guitar and sang a song called \"Adelai\". Calleia composed the tune, and asked Abbott to write the lyrics; the song was published and eventually brought each of them royalties of as much as $2,000 a year.\n\n\"The Broken Wing\" was a hit, and after the play's New York run Calleia and Thurston Hall were carried over in a London production. After four months the show closed and Calleia visited Malta, where he and his father reconciled. At his father's request he began using his real surname, and was billed as Joseph Spurin-Calleia.\n\nOn February 14, 1925, Calleia made his concert debut at Town Hall in New York City, accompanied by pianist Ferdinand Greenwald. \"He proved to be the possessor of an agreeable high voice, which he used with much skill in Italian airs,\" wrote \"New York Times\" music critic Olin Downes, \"including that of Rodolfo from Puccini's \"La Boheme\" and others from Verdi's \"Trovatore\" and \"Rigoletto\".\" In recital at New York's Steinway Hall on February 21, 1926, Calleia \"displayed a voice of pleasant and attractive timbre\" in a program that included works by Scarlatti, Paisiello, Schumann, Gounod and Leoncavallo, as well as two of his own compositions.\n\nCalleia was cast as the Spanish ambassador in the Broadway production of \"Princess Flavia\" (1925), Sigmund Romberg's musical adaptation of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\". While he was waiting for the elaborate production to be mounted he sold pianos, with such success that the store owner offered him a store of his own if he would stay.\n\nIn 1926 Calleia was given his first prominent stage role, in George Abbott and Philip Dunning's smash hit, \"Broadway\". He played a shuffling, coin-jingling waiter in the melodrama that \"New York Times\" critic Brooks Atkinson later called a \"noisy, bustling cyclorama of backstage life [that] remains a landmark in the American theater.\" Calleia also acted as the company's stage manager and, working for producer Jed Harris, he supervised some ten duplicate productions of \"Broadway\" in the US and abroad.\n\nA succession of acclaimed performances in successful Broadway plays followed, including a shiftless newspaper reporter in \"The Front Page\" (1928), a convicted murderer in \"The Last Mile\" (1930), and the sinister chauffeur in \"Grand Hotel\" (1930). Calleia became a star with \"Small Miracle\" (1934), a Broadway production described by \"The New Yorker\" as \"a very satisfactory melodrama with Joseph Spurin-Calleia as the pleasantest murderer you ever saw.\"\n\n\"What an actor—Joseph Calleia\", said Orson Welles, who directed and performed with Calleia in \"Touch of Evil\" (1958):\n\nI fell in love with him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York ... a very well-staged melodrama which was an enormous hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.\n\nNaming the theatre's villain of the year for 1934, nationally syndicated columnist Paul Harrison of the Newspaper Enterprise Association selected \"Joseph Spurin-Calleia, whose gangster role in \"Small Miracle\" provided one of the finest of all performances on Broadway.\"\n\nCalleia had his first real role as a heavy in \"Small Miracle\", and his success in the play was responsible for his move to Hollywood. Calleia's contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer permitted him a hiatus of six months a year, to continue his stage work. He was not new to motion pictures—he had made three feature films on the East Coast—but when MGM put Calleia under contract they promoted his first film, \"Public Hero No. 1\" (1935), as his screen debut. Calleia's portrayal of the gunman was listed by film critic Andre Sennwald of \"The New York Times\" as one of the year's ten best male performances.\n\nCalleia excelled as the villain in films, but he wanted to create characters with some sympathy. \"I'd like to get away from straight villain roles,\" he said in a 1936 interview. \"But I have no wish to be a hero. I enjoy roles where I get slapped around a bit. It's far more stimulating to play a character that isn't all one thing—not all bad and not all good.\" He created a series of darkly mysterious characters edged with humor in films including \"Algiers\" (1938), \"Five Came Back\" (1939), \"Golden Boy\" (1939), \"The Glass Key\" (1942) and \"Gilda\" (1946).\n\nIn June 1935 Calleia was announced to star as Joaquin Murrieta in \"I Am Joaquin\" (later titled \"Robin Hood of El Dorado\"), a film for which he had written the screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia was too old, although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a starring role in \"Man of the People\" (1937), a political drama about a young lawyer fighting corporate racketeers.\n\nCalleia continued to battle typecasting, turning down well-paying villainous roles to develop more complex characters. His performance as police inspector Slimane in Walter Wanger's \"Algiers\" (1938) was recognized by the National Board of Review. Working with director John Farrow at RKO Pictures in 1939, he created a fine character study as the condemned anarchist in \"Five Came Back\", and portrayed a heroic priest in \"Full Confession\". Calleia was announced to star as Father Damien in an RKO picture to be written and directed by Farrow, but the project was not realized.\n\nCalleia became a naturalized citizen of the United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the US. The house where he was born was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at US military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between US and British entertainment units.\n\nIn addition to working steadily in motion pictures for another 20 years, Calleia also starred in the 1948 London stage premiere of Arthur Miller's Tony Award-winning play \"All My Sons\", receiving unanimous critical acclaim. His performance in \"Touch of Evil\" (1958)—as Pete Menzies, longtime partner of corrupt police captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles)—is regarded as one of the best of his career.\n\n\"It is not rare in Welles's films for one actor to break away from the overall gesture of the film to embody a distilled human truth,\" wrote Welles biographer Simon Callow. \"In \"Touch of Evil\" there are two actors who do this—Dietrich and Joseph Calleia, playing Quinlan's deceived colleague, Menzies. Calleia's haunted features figure more and more prominently on screen as the truth about Quinlan increasingly dawns on him, along with the knowledge that he must betray him. ... Calleia's abundant inner life casts a growing spell over the film as it comes to its climax, bringing to vividly personal life Welles's sempiternal subject: betrayal.\"\n\nCalleia retired in 1963 to Sliema, Malta. His wife, Eleanor Vassallo Calleia, whom he had married in 1929, died there in 1967. Calleia died October 31, 1975, aged 78, in St. Julian's. He was interred in the family vault at Santa Maria Addolorata Cemetery in Paola.\n\nCalleia was posthumously honored by the Malta postal authority with a set of two commemorative stamps issued in 1997. In 2005, a bust of Calleia by sculptor Anton Agius was installed at his birthplace in Malta on the initiative of then 15-year-old Eman Bonnici.\n\n"}

{"id": "2079096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079096", "title": "Old Banten", "text": "Old Banten\n\nOld Banten (Indonesian Banten Lama) is an archaeological site in the northern coast of Serang Regency, Banten, Indonesia. Located 11 km north of Serang city, the site of Old Banten contains the ruin of the walled port city of Banten, the 16th-century capital of the Sultanate of Banten.\n\nSince 1995, Old Banten has been proposed to UNESCO World Heritage.\n\nBanten was a 16th-century port city known for its pepper. The city flourished when the Islamic Banten Sultanate reached its peak during the 17th century. There was a period of intense conflicts with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) over the trade of spices, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Sultanate in Banten and to the city's decline.\n\nToday, the site where the city of Banten remains is known as Old Banten. It is a well-known tourist attraction, where many locals visit to pay their respects and pray at the graves of Sultan Maulana Hasanuddin and his descendants; or visits the Great Mosque. The area reflects the sultanate's earlier glory. Notable buildings include the impressive Great Mosque of Banten, ruins of two important Kraton (palaces), the watch tower, the water systems and the artifacts at the Museum of Banten Artifacts.\n\nThe city of Banten was laid out in accordance with precepts imported from Java rather than mirroring local Sundanese ideas. In 1596, the city housed roughly 100,000 people. It was a walled city. Transport within the city was mainly by water: rivers, canals, and bridges. Artificial reservoir and drainage system provides clean water for the city from the southern region of the city via aqueducts and underground pipes. The area within the wall was divided into a northern and a southern half. Only Indonesians were allowed to live within the city wall; foreigners were located outside, with foreign Muslims on the northeast, foreign non-Muslims on the west, both along the shore.\n\nThe northern section contained the remains of the residential compounds of the elite. There is a mosque facing a Javanese alun-alun, a typical layout of Javanese city. The compound of the \"shahbandar\" or the harbor master was located on the eastern side of the alun-alun. the Kraton of Surosowan, as well as the Great Mosque of Banten, is located in this area. Banten population was engaged in common craft such as pottery making, many of these are found and kept in a site museum.\n\nThe city now has been reduced to a mere village, with squatters filling empty space in between archaeological area. Despite encouraged tourism, especially for the Great Mosque of Banten, the rest of the site received lack of proper conservation.\n\nThe Surosowan Kraton is a ruined palace where the Sultans of Banten resided. The palace was built in 1552. Unlike the Kaibon Kraton, there is little left inside the kraton. The only visible remains of the kraton is the half to two meter wall — of red stone and coral stone — surrounding the perimeter of the kraton complex. The layout of former buildings are visible from the foundation's layout. One of the visible remains is a rectangular pool, assumed to be the pleasure pool where the princess of Banten took a bath, not different from the pleasure pool of Yogyakarta Kraton. The fort was destroyed by the Dutch during a conflict with Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa in 1680.\n\nThere was a plan for reconstruction of the compounds within Kraton Surosowan in early 2013, however it is not clear how to finance the reconstruction process.\n\nThere are several mosques inside and outside the walled city of Old Banten. The largest mosque, and the only surviving building within the Old Banten walled city, is the Great Mosque of Banten. Well-maintained by its followers, the Great Mosque complex contains several buildings which shows a mixture of architectural style. The mosque shows a mixture of local Javanese and Chinese influence, the lighthouse-shaped minaret shows Portuguese influence, the \"tiyamah\" building (where Islamic studies are conducted), which was built by a Dutchman who converted into Islam, features a typical Dutch colonial style with its high sash window.\n\nOther remains of mosques around Old Banten are the \"Masjid Kanari\", a tower of the ruined \"Masjid Pecinan Tinggi\", the already demolished mosque of the Kraton Kaibon, and ruins of Koja Mosque.\n\nThe Kaibon Kraton is the ruined palace and residence of Ratu Aisyah, the queen and mother of Sultan Syaifuddin. The Kraton was destroyed in 1832 following the order of Daendels, partly because unlike other Sultanates in Indonesia, the Sultanate of Banten never bowed to the colonial government. Several buildings are still visible.\n\nThe Chinese temple is one of the oldest in Indonesia. The existence of this vihara in Old Banten means that the Buddhist religion was tolerated in the overall Muslim city of Banten.\n\nNot far from the Great Mosque of Banten is a Dutch fort built in 1682. The fort is square shaped. There is a European cemetery to the southeast of the fort.\n\nThe Museum of Old Banten (Indonesian \"Museum Situs Kepurbakalaan Banten Lama\") is a museum located between Surosowan Kraton and the Great Mosque. The museum kept archaeological remnants such as ceramic vases, roof, and coins related with the historic port city of Banten. Other important artifacts are \"Meriam Ki Amuk\" (a 2.5 meter long Ottoman cannon) and a stone pepper mill.\n\nThere are remnants of infrastructures outside the walled city of Banten. \"Tasik Ardi\" (Ardi Lake) is a rectangular 5 hectare artificial lake formerly used as a water reservoir for the city of Banten. From this reservoir, water are channeled via pipes and viaducts to the city, passing a series of water treatment stations. Some of these water treatment stations are still visible today.\n\nThe village of Kasunyatan, several meter south of Old Banten, was once an Islamic learning center for the Sultan of Banten. There are several tombs and 16th-century Kasunyatan Mosque in the village.\n\n\n"}

It is usually hit from the back of the tennis court, around the \"baseline\".\n\nA tennis player whose strategy is to trade groundstrokes with the opponent is termed a \"baseliner\", as opposed to \"volleyers\" who prefers to hit volleys near the net.\n\nThere are many factors that may define a good groundstroke. For example, one groundstroke may use topspin and another backspin. Both can be effective for different reasons having to do with depth, opponent's strength or weaknesses, etc. Some characteristics of groundstrokes are: depth (how close the ball lands to the opponent's baseline), consistency (the tendency of groundstrokes to not drop short or into an opponent’s strike range in rallies with many groundstrokes), speed (how fast it travels in the air), pace (the ball's behavior after it bounces on the opponent's side), trajectory and angle. If a \"good groundstroke\" is to be played, it would generally have a combination of the above characteristics to produce a shot that is difficult for the opponent to return. Generally, a groundstroke that lands deep and in the corner of the opponent's court will make it more difficult for the opponent to return the ball. However, this is somewhat arbitrary and depends on the opponent and stage of the point being played. For example, a short angled shot, a moon ball (very high trajectory), an off pace shot, etc., may prove effective against opponent A but not opponent B.\n\n\n"}

She was part of the Russian New Wave literary movement. She was cited by Joseph Brodsky as the best living poet in the Russian language. She is known in Russia as \"the voice of the epoch\".\n\nDespite the aforementioned apolitical stance of her writing, Akhmadulina was often critical of authorities in the Soviet Union, and spoke out in favour of others, including Nobel laureates Boris Pasternak, Andrei Sakharov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. She was known to international audiences via her travels abroad during the Khrushchev Thaw, during which she made appearances in sold-out stadiums. Upon her death in 2010 at the age of 73, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev hailed her poetry as a \"classic of Russian literature.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" said Akhmadulina was \"always recognized as one of the Soviet Union's literary treasures and a classic poet in the long line extending from Lermontov and Pushkin.\" Sonia I. Ketchian, writing in \"The Poetic Craft of Bella Akhmadulina\", called her \"one of the great poets of the 20th century. There's Akhmatova, Tsvetaeva, Mandelstam, and Pasternak – and she's the fifth\".\n\nBella Akhmadulina was born in Moscow on 10 April 1937, the only child of a Tatar father and a Russian-Italian mother. They underwent evacuation to Kazan when World War II broke out.\n\nAkhmadulina's literary career began when she was a school-girl working as a journalist at the Moscow newspaper, \"Metrostroevets\", and improving her poetic skills at a circle organized by the poet Yevgeny Vinokurov. Her first poems appeared in the magazine \"October\" after being approved by established Soviet poets. These first poems were published in 1955. Émigré critic Marc Slonim described her prospects as follows in 1964 (\"Soviet Russian Literature\"): \"Her voice has such a purity of tone, such richness of timbre, such individuality of diction, that if her growth continues she will be able some day to succeed Akhmatova\" as \"the greatest living woman poet in Russia\".\n\nAfter finishing school, Akhmadulina entered the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute from which she graduated in 1960. While studying at the institute, she published her poems and articles in different newspapers, both official and handwritten. She was the subject of criticism in \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" in 1957. She was expelled in 1959 (but allowed re-entry as time progressed) as a result of her opposition to the persecution of Boris Pasternak. In 1962 the first collection of her poems, titled \"Struna\" (\"The String\"), was published and was a resounding success. In spite of being expunged, many of her collections of verses were published later: \"Music lessons\" (1970), \"Poems\" (1975), \"Candle\" (1977), \"Dreams of Georgia\" (1977), \"The Mystery\" (1983), \"Coastline\" (1991), and others. A collection called \"Sad\" (\"Garden\") led to Akhmadulina receiving the USSR State Prize in 1989.\n\n\"Many dogs and one dog\", a short story written in a surreal style, was published in 1979 in Samizdat's \"Metropol Almanac\". She assisted in the creation of \"Metropol\". She wrote essays about Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov.\n\nShe appeared in sold-out stadiums in the 1960s, as did the poets Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Andrei Voznesensky and Robert Rozhdestvensky.\n\nHer open letter was published supporting the exiled Andrei Sakharov. In October 1993, she signed the Letter of Forty-Two.\n\nShe was a journalist in a 1964 film.\n\nBella participated in many international poetry events including Kuala Lumpur International Poetry Reading (1988).\n\nAfter the Soviet Union she published \"Casket and Key\" (1994), \"A Guiding Sound\" (1995) and \"One Day in December\" (1996).\n\nThe main themes of Akhmadulina's works are friendship, love, and relations between people. She wrote numerous essays about Russian poets and translators, some devoted to her close friend, Bulat Okudzhava. Akhmadulina avoided writing overtly political poems, but took part in political events in her youth, supporting the so-called \"dissident movement\". She translated into Russian poetry from France, Italy, Chechnya, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, and many others.\n\nAkhmadulina wrote in a \"resolutely apolitical\" style. She made use of imagery and humour in her work. She used rhymed quatrains in her early works, which discussed ordinary, yet imaginative occurrences from daily life in language that was full of both archaisms and neologisms. Religion and philosophy became her themes as she aged and she wrote in longer forms.\n\nBella's first marriage in 1954 was to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, another famous poet of the era; her second husband, whom she married in 1960, was Yuri Nagibin, a major novelist and screenwriter. Her third marriage in 1971 to film director Eldar Kuliev produced a daughter, Elizaveta Kulieva, who is also a poet. In 1974, she married her last husband, the famous artist and stage designer Boris Messerer. They had homes in Peredelkino and Moscow.\n\nAkhmadulina died at her home in Peredelkino near Moscow on 29 November 2010 at the age of 73. Akhmadulina's husband said her death was from a heart condition, describing it as a \"cardiovascular crisis\". Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin both paid tribute, with Medvedev writing on his blog that the death was an \"irreparable loss\". Medevdev also wrote that Akhmadulina's poetry was a \"classic of Russian literature\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1977, Bella Akhmadulina became an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (see AAAL website).\n\n\n"}

Possessing a deep baritone voice, he began his career in radio in St. Louis, Missouri before becoming a Hollywood actor. He is remembered for voicing Robby the Robot in the science fiction film \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956), a role he reprised in the lesser-known \"The Invisible Boy\" (1957).\n\nMiller's next most notable role is that of Michael Anthony, the loyal assistant of Paul Frees' generous billionaire J. B. Tipton Jr., on the TV series \"The Millionaire\" (1955–1960).\n\nBorn Marvin Mueller in St. Louis, Miller graduated from Washington University before commencing his career in radio. When a singer named Marvin Miller debuted on another St. Louis radio station, he began using his middle initial to distinguish himself from the newcomer. For the \"Mutual Broadcasting System\", he narrated a daily 15-minute radio show entitled \"The Story Behind the Story\", which offered historical vignettes. He also served as announcer on several Old Time Radio shows of the 1940s and 1950s, including \"The Jo Stafford Show\" and the long-running mystery series \"The Whistler\".\n\nMiller played Dr. Lee Markham on \"The Woman in White\" on NBC radio and Howard Andrews on \"Midstream\" on the Blue Network and appeared as \"The voice of the Past\" on the May 21, 1942 broadcast of The Right to Happiness. In 1945–47, he was the announcer for \"Songs by Sinatra\". He played two characters and was the announcer on \"The Billie Burke Show\" (1943-1946).\n\nIn 1952, Miller had a one-man program, \"Armchair Adventures,\" on CBS. He did \"all voices and narration\" in the 15-minute dramatic anthology. He also recorded 260 episodes of a program described in a 1950 trade publication as \"Marvin Miller: Famous radio voice in series of five minute vignettes about famous people.\" The program was syndicated via electrical transcription by The Cardinal Company.\n\nHe also won Grammy Awards in 1965 and 1966 for his recordings of Dr. Seuss stories: in 1967 for Dr Seuss Presents – \"If I Ran the Zoo\" and \"Sleep Book\" and 1966 for Dr Seuss Presents \"Fox in Socks\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham\". He also read \"Horton Hatches the Egg\", \"The Sneetches and Other Stories\" and \"Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories\".,ref>Marvin Miller - Dr Suess Presents...Horton Hatches The Egg, The Sneetches And Other Stories</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Miller even lent his voice to sports films, narrating the official Indianapolis 500 films in 1975 and 1976.\n\nIn films, the heavyset Miller was often cast as a villain, many times playing Asian roles. He portrayed a sadistic henchman in the 1947 Humphrey Bogart film \"Dead Reckoning\" and was Yamada in the 1945 James Cagney effort \"Blood on the Sun\". In 1946's film noir \"Deadline at Dawn\" he plays Sleepy Parsons, a blind pianist. Miller played George \"Gusty\" Gustafson in the George Raft film noir classic \"Johnny Angel\".\n\nMiller also did a great deal of voice work in animation from the 1950s to 1970s, from the narration on the 1950 Academy Award-winning United Productions of America cartoon \"Gerald McBoing Boing\" to the 1970 \"The Ant and the Aardvark\" cartoon \"Scratch a Tiger\".\n\nFrom 1949 to 1950 he starred as Dr. Yat Fu on the short-lived ABC series \"Mysteries of Chinatown\", with Gloria Saunders cast as his niece. In 1961, Miller guest-starred as Johnny Kelso, with Erin O'Brien, in \"The Marble Slab\" episode of the Frederick Ziv-, United Artists-, and MGM-produced Bat Masterson, starring Gene Barry. Original air date was May 11, 1961.\n\nMiller voiced \"Mr. Sun\" in the AT&T educational film \"Our Mr. Sun\", and \"Hemo\" in the AT&T educational film \"Hemo the Magnificent\", parts of a series featuring Dr. Frank C. Baxter and directed by Frank Capra, which was shown on American network television in 1956 and 1957. Miller crossed paths with other prolific voice-over artists many times in his career including June Foray, playing \"Deer\" in \"Hemo the Magnificent\" and in the TV series \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" along with Paul Frees, who voiced \"Boris Badenov\" in that program. Miller and Frees also performed in separate segments on the audio recording \"Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America Volume One The Early Years\".\n\nMiller made a guest appearance in 1963 on \"Perry Mason\" as unscrupulous attorney F.J. Weatherby in \"The Case of the Lover's Leap.\"\n\nMiller voiced Aquaman for the Filmation studio for their 1967 series \"The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure\". He was also the voice of pilot/scientist Busby Birdwell in the company's animated series \"Fantastic Voyage\".\n\nHe was the voice of the arrogant alien \"Zarn\" in three episodes of the second season of \"Land of the Lost\". Miller also lent his distinct voice to \"The Pink Panther Show\", often talking with the feline offscreen and asking questions, while also voicing The Inspector, his second Deux Deux and their boss The Commissioner.\n\nOn \"The Millionaire\", Miller played Michael Anthony in over 200 episodes, conveying the wishes of the \"fabulously wealthy\" John Beresford Tipton, voiced by Paul Frees.\n\nMiller died in 1985 at the age of 71 from a heart attack. He is entombed at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles.\n\nFor his contribution to the television industry, Marvin Miller has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n"}

{"id": "2079161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079161", "title": "WNRG-FM", "text": "WNRG-FM\n\nWNRG-FM (106.9 FM; \"Energy 106.9\") is a rhythmic contemporary radio station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, licensed to the suburb of Brookfield. The station is owned by the Milwaukee Radio Group subsidiary of Saga Communications. Its studios (which are shared with the other four sister stations) and transmitter are located in Milwaukee's West Side.\n\nThe 106.9 frequency came into being in Milwaukee when it was licensed as WLJU on February 10, 1993. The new station was owned by Harris Classical Broadcasting, which also owned Milwaukee's heritage Classical station, WFMR. It formally signed on for the first time in August 1995 as WFMI, playing a satellite-fed smooth jazz format. A more powerful and resourceful station, WJZI (93.3) converted from a failing rock format as WQFM to smooth jazz in 1996, giving WFMI stiff competition.\n\nBoth stations were sold to Saga Communications, and WFMI was quickly switched to a Modern AC format, becoming WXPT on May 9, 1997, branded as \"106.9 The Point\" (the first song on \"The Point\" was Sheryl Crow's \"A Change Would Do You Good\"). When Chicago's WPNT-FM changed formats a few months later, 106.9 picked up the WPNT call sign. They had modest success for a small station, but a few of the bigger stations in the market took notice and adjusted their playlists to fight off the young suburban upstart.\n\nThe station is also hamstrung by a traditionally weak signal which has never covered the important suburban markets like the Waukesha and Ozaukee County suburbs very well, and is virtually non-existent north of the Sheboygan County line, where it runs into adjacent-channel interference from WHBZ on 106.5. This is because the frequency was a short-spacing allocation which is shared with WOOD-FM across Lake Michigan in Muskegon, Michigan, which is at a very strong 50,000 watts compared to this station's weaker power, and it does have conflicting interference with that station on the northern rim of their coverage area.\n\nAgain, due to stiff competition, the format was changed again at 3 p.m. on April 16, 1999, this time to a trendy new format known as Jammin' Oldies, and the call letters became WMJO (Milwaukee's Jammin' Oldies). The calls were changed a month later to WJMR and tag line to \"Jammin' Hits\" due to legal issues.\n\nSaga Communications moved WFMR to the 106.9 FM dial position, and WJMR-FM's format and call letters to 98.3, on December 12, 2000. This was done primarily to boost WJMR-FM's signal in the urban areas of Milwaukee, and to target WFMR toward the western and northern suburbs. Saga moved the studios to Milwaukee the year before, in 1999.\n\nAt midnight on June 26, 2007, ironically on the 51st anniversary of its original sign-on, WFMR ended its classical music format when it flipped to the Smooth Jazz format, a change made quickly to gain momentum from rival WJZI, which dropped the format a week earlier to become light Adult Contemporary music as WLDB/\"B93.3\". On July 15, 2007, the station changed its call sign to WJZX.\n\nOn April 24, 2007, the FCC granted what was then WFMR a construction permit to move its transmitter from its original site in Menomonee Falls to the WJYI/WHQG/WJMR tower in Milwaukee outside of the stations' main studios on McKinley Avenue. However, because the station moved closer to Lake Michigan, the power was thus reduced in half from the Menomonee Falls signal to 4.4 kW in order to protect what was then WMUS (currently WOOD-FM) across the lake. 106.9's HD Radio signal was put into service in 2008, though because of the current limitations of digital radio the digital signal only covers the city of Milwaukee and eastern Waukesha County proper.\n\nOn May 27, 2010 at Noon, after playing \"Life in the Fast Lane\" by Dave Koz, WJZX flipped from Broadcast Architecture's syndicated satellite feed Smooth AC \"Smooth Jazz Network\" to a stunt format called \"Tiger 106.9\", which referenced Tiger Woods's scandals and featured cheating-themed music from all eras. Saga had reserved the call letters WNQW, possibly referring to the then-popular \"Now\" format of Top 40 music and announced them publicly in the media, which may have proved to be problematic in hindsight as seen below. The format change was likely done due to the introduction of Arbitron's Portable People Meter audience measurement system in the month of June into the Milwaukee market.\n\nBA's smooth/urban AC format remained for a period of time without local broadcasters on 106.9's HD Radio HD2 subchannel, which has since been replaced with an HD relay of sister AM station WJYI, which has a Christian/brokered programming format. Internet listeners were referred to the live stream of Saga sister station WJZA in Columbus, Ohio, which featured the same basic format and playlist structuring as the former WJZI. However, WJZA has since also changed format to classic hits.\n\nThe next day, at 9 a.m., the 70s/80s rock station WQBW, owned by Clear Channel Communications, flipped to top 40 as \"97.3 Radio Now.\" This was likely done to block Saga's attempt to brand 106.9 with the new WNQW calls as \"106.9 Now\". 106.9's new call sign was registered with the FCC on May 21, along with the new \"Now\" branding. Clear Channel appeared ready to reformat \"The Brew\" even before WJZX's stunting, and put it into place earlier than expected to claim the \"Now\" brand before 106.9 had the opportunity. 97.3 took the calls WRNW on June 10.\n\nThe \"Tiger Radio\" stunt carried over into May 29 before a switch to songs featuring the word \"America\" in the title throughout the remainder of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Saga also could not cancel the WNQW calls, which were implemented as scheduled on May 28, so it retained those calls until it filed for a new set.\n\nThe station switched to another stunt format on June 2, playing The Beatles' entire catalog in alphabetical order. The catalog looped several times through the next few days.\n\nOn June 7, 2010, at 3 p.m., after the Beatles stunt ended with \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", 106.9 finally debuted their new permanent format, with the name \"Big Buck Country 106.9.\" The station played classic country, which focused on country music from the late 1970s through early 1990s and debuted with the Alan Jackson hit \"Gone Country\". It put 106.9 in direct competition with AM Clear Channel operation WOKY (920), Clear Channel station WMIL-FM (106.1), and West Bend's WBWI-FM (92.5), which has most of its audience in Milwaukee's northern suburbs. The call letters WZBK-FM became effective June 15, 2010, calls already in use by a sister AM operation in Keene, New Hampshire.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, at 10 a.m., after playing \"What Might Have Been\" by Little Texas and the first minute and a half of \"The Thunder Rolls\" by Garth Brooks (which began repeating on the line \"When the thunder rolls/and the lightning strikes...\" before grinding to a halt that led into energizing sound effects featuring thunder and lightning), WZBK changed their format to Rhythmic Top 40, branded as \"Energy 106.9\". \"Energy\" launched with \"Party Rock Anthem\" by LMFAO. In a statement from general manager Annmarie Topel, the station's format will be similar to a contemporary-hits format, but with \"no bubble-gum pop,\" and added that \"As the (rhythmic CHR) format evolves, there are great opportunities for stations that are newer, faster, cleaner and leaner.\" On September 12, the call letters were changed to WNRG. (Despite this, WNRG-FM continued using the WZBK legal ID liners for two more days.) In its first 30 days, WNRG was commercial free and promised to play 10,069 songs until October 8, when it added commercials and began promising to play 60 minutes of music per hour on air.\n\nThe flip to Rhythmic also brings the format back to Milwaukee for the first time since September 1994, when WLUM carried the format before they flipped to Alternative, which at the time was due to owner Willie Davis' decision to move the station away from playing the increasing Hip-Hop content that he felt was too offensive. Like WLUM (during its later years), WNRG-FM's Rhythmic playlist is heavily focused on Rhythmic Pop/Dance currents, but has incorporated more R&B/Hip-Hop into the musical mix. As such, WNRG-FM faces competition from Top 40/CHR rival WXSS, and from Urban Contemporary rival WKKV.\n\nWNRG-FM is also the first station in the Saga Communications Rhythmic Top 40 line up to be launched on a full-powered signal, as their two other outlets in Des Moines (HITS99.9 K260AM/KIOA) and Champaign (HITS99.7 WIXY-HD3 & W259BG), broadcasts on simulcasting HD radio subchannels and FM translators. They also share the same fonts and logos except for the branding (Des Moines and Champaign's monikers are \"Hits\"). The WNRG voiceover imaging and liners are being handled by Scott Matthews and Wendy K. Gray of CESD Talent. All 3 stations were programmed in Milwaukee by Saga/Milwaukee PD Brandon Rowe up until his departure in May 2013.\n\nOn January 25, 2013, and after running jockless for four months, WNRG hired its first airstaffer, Jeremy \"Cousin Ed\" Schultz, for afternoons, while Rowe took the 7PM-Midnight slot until his exit from the station. They also added DJ Ekin for mix shows duties, airing at 6PM and 10PM daily. WNRG began adding an airstaffer for the midday slot with the hiring of Taylor Vaughn in October 2013. Taylor left in January 2014 and was replaced by Ashley Z (who has also since left the station; Mandy Scott replaced her afterwards).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079170", "title": "Namco × Capcom", "text": "Namco × Capcom\n\nThe project was proposed by Monolith Soft to celebrate Namco's 50th anniversary, and Capcom was contacted as a partner due to their large character roster. Development began in 2003, directed and written by former Banpresto staff member Soichiro Morizumi. The artwork was cooperatively designed by \"Soulcalibur\" artist Takuji Kawano, Kazue Saito of \"Super Robot Wars\", and veteran artist Kazunori Haruyama. The soundtrack uses arrangements of themes from the represented series, with original themes composed by Yuzo Koshiro.\n\nFirst announced in January 2005, the game was never released outside Japan, a fact attributed to the obscurity of some characters and the scale of its script. Releasing to strong sales, the game was given mixed reviews by Japanese and English journalists. Following \"Namco × Capcom\", Monolith Soft would work on some other crossover titles, including the successor \"Project X Zone\" in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\n\"Namco × Capcom\" is a tactical role-playing game which puts players in control of teams of characters drawn from the video game properties of Namco and Capcom. Gameplay is divided into levels, which are unlocked as the player progresses through the narrative. These levels are split between story segments told through character interactions and gameplay where party members face off against enemy parties, with victory conditions which include clearing the field of enemies. In addition to normal story missions, the player can engage in training levels using training dummies to practice moves. They can also purchase items for healing or character boosts at shops using currency won during battles and through a gambling minigame activated between certain story chapters.\n\nCharacter moves and actions are dictated by Ability Points (AP), of which a set amount is assigned to each character at the beginning of a battle. The game's turn-based battles play out in a grid-based arena from an overhead perspective; each unit on both sides has their turn placed according to their current AP. Any character with ten AP can move and perform actions, with AP being recovered by doing little or nothing for each turn. Movement distance varies between characters, with some walking or flying and others being able to pass over obstacles. Playable characters appear in both pairs and as solo units, with different characters specialising in short or long-range attacks based on their abilities in their native series.\n\nWhen units engage in battle, the game transitions into a horizontal view. Timed button presses trigger different attacks. Each unit's attack number is dictated by a counter labelled \"Branch\". When the Branch counter is depleted, the battle ends, and if the enemy unit is defeated they disappear from the map. Successful attacks begin a combination, which increase a character's experience point (EXP) reward. Continual attacks also raise a character's fatigue level, which when maxed out will prevent them from moving for several turns.\n\nSuccessful attacks build up special meters which allow for both a unit-specific special attack and a Multi-Assault attack where another character is called in to deal extra damage. The player party can also engage in a defensive battle when attacked, with successful defending decreasing or nullifying damage and regaining AP. The player can also directly counterattack, which drains AP. With each battle, player characters gain experience levels based on earned EXP.\nThe story opens with Reiji Arisu and his kitsune mentor Xiaomu, operatives for the supernatural investigative task force Shinra, being called to deal with interdimensional rifts opening in their world. These rifts pull in beings from alternate realities, many of which ally with Reiji and Xiaomu to fight both the forces behind the rifts and opponents drawn from their native universes. The group is opposed by Ouma, a group dedicated to causing chaos, with their main rival being Ouma operative Saya, a being similar to Xiaomu. It is eventually revealed that Ouma wishes to resurrect a dark deity dubbed \"99\" through the merging of multiple realities. Reiji's father Shougo fought Saya to prevent this ten years before and was forced to sacrifice himself with Xiaomu's aid to succeed. While initially defeated, Ouma succeeds in merging the worlds, and 99 is resurrected using Saya as a host. While Reiji is prepared to sacrifice himself as Shougo did, his and Xiaomu's allies return from their realities and combine their powers to cripple 99. Saya allows herself to be killed by Reiji to destroy 99 permanently. At a celebratory party which all their allies attend, Reiji and Xiaomu mutually declare their love for each other.\n\n\"Namco × Capcom\" was developed by Monolith Soft, then a subsidiary of Namco consisting of former Square employees who had gained fame through their work on the \"Xenosaga\" series and \"\". The game was directed and written by Soichiro Morizumi, a former employee of Banpresto and veteran of their \"Super Robot Wars\" franchise. The producer was Kouji Ishitani, who had served as an assistant director for \"Xenosaga Episode I\" and \"Baten Kaitos\". Development began in 2003, and was initially proposed by Monolith Soft as an internal crossover of Namco characters for the company's 50th anniversary. This led to a roster of around 100 characters, but the team wanted a larger roster. To achieve this and create a \"more exciting\" experience, Namco reached out to Capcom to collaborate on the project. Capcom agreed, breaking the accepted reality of the time for large rival companies not to cooperate on a project. The game was Capcom's second major collaboration with another publisher following the \"SNK vs. Capcom\" series.\n\n\"Namco × Capcom\" was Morizumi's first project for Monolith Soft, and he was in charge of writing the game's scenario. The main theme of the story was \"Love\", a theme common to Morizumi's later writing. The antagonistic Saya was originally written as \"brutal and irritating\", but the character's interactions with Xiaomu and the input of her voice actress Ai Orikasa changed Saya into a woman with a big sister persona. This forced multiple rewrites to the script. While he remembered it fondly in later years, Morizumi found the project exhausting. Shinichiro Okamoto, one of the game's executive producers, described the project as difficult for him and credited the rest of the staff with helping the game reach completion.\n\nThe character redesigns for Namco and Capcom characters were done by Takuji Kawano, an artist from the \"Soulcalibur\" series. The original characters were designed by Kazue Saito, who like Morizumi had worked on the \"Super Robot Wars\" franchise. Saito also designed the sprite graphics, and cut-in graphics for battles. The conversation portraits for characters were designed by veteran artist Kazunori Haruyama. The design of main protagonist Reiji was based on the builds of professional wrestlers. The game's opening animation was produced by Production I.G, famous for their work on anime and video game series.\n\n\"Namco × Capcom\" was announced in January 2005; at this point, the game was 70% complete. When first announced, \"Mega Man\" creator Keiji Inafune praised the initiative behind the project. \"Namco × Capcom\" was released in Japan on May 26, 2005. The game was never released internationally. Several outlets cited both its large amount of text, and a lack of worldwide recognition for a lot of represented characters as potential reasons. A fan translation was created by a group called TransGen, who also created a translation for the PlayStation 2 port of \"\". The team working on \"Namco × Capcom\" included ten people developing the patch itself, and thirty beta testers. The translation was completed over two years, releasing in 2008.\n\nThe soundtrack consists mainly of arrangements of themes from represented series. The only credited arranger is Yasunori Mitsuda, who worked on his own tracks for \"Xenosaga Episode I\". The opening theme \"Brave New World\" and ending theme \"Someday, Under the Moon\" were composed by Yuzo Koshiro. The game was Koshiro's first time writing vocal themes. Koshiro was brought in to work on \"Namco × Capcom\" due to Ishitani being a fan of his work, with the vocal themes being the composer's only contribution to the soundtrack. The lyrics were written by Morizumi and both songs were performed by Flair. A special soundtrack album containing selected tracks was released as a first-print bonus with early buyers of the game. A full soundtrack album, which included an extended version of \"Brave New World\" and karaoke versions of both songs, was released by Capcom's music label Suleputer on August 31, 2005.\n\nDuring the weeks following its release, the game came among the top ten best-selling games, reaching sales of nearly 117,000 units by late June. By the end of the year, the game was among the top 100 best-selling games in Japan, with total sales of 131,600.\n\nJapanese magazine \"Famitsu\" positively noted the use of \"kyōgen\" comedy routines in dialogue, but found other characters lacking development. One reviewer enjoyed the combination-based battles, but another faulted the game's balance. Gaming website \"Hardcore Gaming 101\" said the game was \"all about fan service\", enjoying the character interactions but finding the gameplay itself very shallow. \"Siliconera\" similarly noted shallow and repetitive gameplay, but said that fans of both Namco and Capcom would enjoy the crossover elements.\n\nHirohiko Niizumi of \"GameSpot\" felt that players needed extensive background knowledge of the represented series to enjoy the game, but enjoyed the interactions between characters. He also noted the simplicity of the gameplay, attributed to the need for broad appeal. Anoop Gantayat, writing for \"IGN\", found the visuals lacking despite the game's hardware, and called the story structure \"pretty plain\". He was also disappointed by the shallow RPG elements.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Namco × Capcom\", the two companies would collaborate on future projects, particularly \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" and the \"Mobile Suit Gundam VS\" series. The \"Namco × Capcom\" development team would later collaborate with Banpresto on the 2008 Nintendo DS game \"\". They released its DS sequel \"\", in 2010.\n\nMonolith Soft and Banpresto later co-developed the 2012 Nintendo 3DS title \"Project X Zone\". Designed as a successor to \"Namco × Capcom\" with similar gameplay and narrative, \"Project X Zone\" combined characters from Sega franchises with returning ones from Namco and Capcom. Its 2015 sequel, \"Project X Zone 2\", would be developed solely by Monolith Soft and feature additional collaborations with Nintendo franchises.\n\n"}

The company specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises.\n\nThe company was founded in 1982 in Israel as an offshoot of Golden Pages, the Israeli phone directory company, which was owned by the Aurec Group headed by Morris Kahn. In 1982, Boaz Dotan became Amdocs' first President and CEO. Together with others at Golden Pages, Kahn developed a billing software program for phone directory companies and with Boaz Dotan established a company called Aurec Information & Directory Systems to market this product.\n\nIn 1985, Southwestern Bell Corporation acquired a 50 percent ownership share of Aurec Information & Directory Systems, and its name was changed to Amdocs. Within two years, the Aurec Group sold off all its holdings in Amdocs for almost US$1 billion.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1995 Amdocs took its initial diversification steps, expanding first into the wireline telephony arena and then the mobile space. Over the years, Amdocs has continued to expand its product and services offerings. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in June 1998, moving to the NASDAQ Global Select Market in 2014. In 1995, Avi Naor replaced Boaz Dotan as President and CEO of Amdocs.\n\nAmdocs entered the managed services space in 1999 with the acquisition of ITDS.\n\nAmdocs acquired software firm Clarify in 2001 for $200 million.

In 2006, Amdocs acquired Cramer Systems.\n\nAmdocs acquired Israeli startup SigValue in 2007 for $85 million. In 2008, Amdocs acquired Irish software company Changing Worlds for $60 million.\n\nIn November 2010, Eli Gelman replaced Dov Baharav as Amdocs' President and CEO. Also in 2010, Amdocs acquired MX Telecom for $104 million. Also in 2013, Amdocs acquired Actix.\n\nIn 2015, Amdocs acquired a majority of Comverse BSS for $272 million. In 2016, Amdocs acquired Vindicia. Also in 2016, Amdocs acquired Tel Aviv-based company Pontis.\n\nOn September 7, 2016 Amdocs launched Amdocs Optima, a new division geared towards providing its customer care solution for digital enterprises with less than 10 million subscribers and MVNOs/MVNEs. Later that month, Amdocs acquired Irish software company Brite:Bill.\n\nIn late 2017, Amdocs acquired Kenzan Media. In 2018, Amdocs acquired projekt202. Also in 2018, Amdocs acquired Canadian company UXP Systems.\n\nIn October 2018, Shuky Sheffer replaced Eli Gelman as Amdocs' President and CEO.\n\nIn August 2019, Amdocs acquired TTS, a privately-owned provider of mobile network engineering services, to further expand its 5G capabilities. The acquisition was valued at $50 million. Also in August 2019, Amdocs and Microsoft Azure partnered with SES Networks for satellite deployment. Amdocs had previously developed LF Networking's Open Network Automation Platform. Later that month, Charter and Comcast selected Amdocs to provide mobile service support.\n\nIn November 2019, AT&T extended its partnership with Amdocs, aiming to upgrade AT&T's digital support business as well as implementing DevOps.\n\nIn January 2020, Amdocs donated resources including food packs to Globe Telecom as part of aid operations for Filipino communities affected by the eruption of Taal volcano. These donations came as part of Amdocs Corporate Social Responsibility program.\n\nAmdocs' broad access to U.S. telephone transaction records has raised counterintelligence concerns in the U.S. government about the vulnerability of this information to exploitation by Israeli spies. \"As early as 1999, the National Security Agency issued a warning that records of U.S. government telephone calls were ending up in foreign hands – Israel's, in particular.\"\n\nIn early 2000, federal agencies conducted a counterintelligence investigation to determine if Amdocs was being used by Israel to eavesdrop on U.S. government communications.

SEUCK) is a game creation system for the Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST created by Sensible Software and published by Outlaw (part of Palace Software) in 1987. It allows the user to make simple shoot 'em ups by drawing sprites and backgrounds and editing attack patterns. The advertising promoted the Kit with the phrase \"By the programmers of \"Wizball\" and \"Parallax\"\".\n\nThe Kit presents users with a series of menus for customising every aspect of the game. Level graphics are created with the Background Editor, using a series of blocks for plotting into the level maps' all moving elements are designed with the Sprite Editor. Sprites are assigned to \"Objects\" - for example, enemy bullets - with separate animation and colour settings. Editing the \"enemy bits\" changes the behaviour of an enemy (which projectiles it may shoot, how many points it is worth), while \"player limitations\" does the same for Player 1 (or player 2, if enabled). Whereas the Commodore 64 version contains a simple Sound FX Editor with slider controls, on the Amiga and ST versions this feature is replaced with IFF sounds.\n\nEnemies are added to the game by placing them on the background and then moving them, with options to link enemies together. The front end (title screen) may also be edited.\n\nGames can feature still screens (held for a set number of seconds), \"push\" scrolling (based on the player's movement) or constant vertical scrolling. Bonus point items are possible, as well as extra lives awarded at regular scoring intervals.\n\nSEUCK is packaged with sample games, to demonstrate what may be done with the kit. The Commodore 64 version comes with \"Slap 'n' Tickle\" (inspired by \"Slap Fight\"), \"Outlaw\" (a Wild West shoot 'em up in the style of the arcade game Commando), \"Transputer Man\" (set inside a computer and partially inspired by the arcade game Robotron 2084), and \"Celebrity Squares\" (featuring graphics drawn by several C64 personalities including video game journalists Gary Liddon and Gary Penn). The Amiga and Atari versions (released in 1989) feature \"Slap 'n' Tickle\", \"Quazar\", and an \"army man\" game, \"Blood 'N' Bullets\", which features a sound effect of \"Okay, suckers\" sampled from the Red Dwarf episode \"Queeg\".\n\nSince it is possible to export SEUCK games as stand-alone files, at the height of the software's popularity game companies and magazines received many games created with the Kit. \n\nSEUCK was well received, earning a Zzap! Gold Medal Award. SEUCK was reviewed in Commodore Disk User Issue 2.\n\nWhile attending college Ray Larabie, best known for his custom typefaces, created several games using SEUCK. Because of their distinctiveness and quality they quickly spread throughout the Amiga community via the BBS network, with many ending up on Amiga Magazine coverdisks. Titles included \"Monster Truck Rally\", \"Wielder Of Atoms\", \"Mulroney Blast\" and \"Smurf Hunt\".\n\nOther notable SEUCK-based titles include several works by Italian software company, System Editoriale s.r.l., such as Emiliano Sciarra's \"Ciuffy\", and the early\n\n\n"}

He won a 1943 Pulitzer Prize as a \"Daily News\" war correspondent.\n\nWeller's reports from Nagasaki after its August 1945 nuclear bombing were censored by the U.S. military and not published in full until a book edited by his son in 2006.\n\nWeller was born in Boston in 1907 and graduated from the Roxbury Latin School in 1925. He was editorial chairman of \"The Harvard Crimson\" as a college student graduated from Harvard in 1929. During his senior year there, he wrote the book and co-wrote the lyrics for the 83rd annual Hasty Pudding Club musical comedy production, \"Fireman, Save My Child!\"\n\nHe studied acting in Vienna, Austria as the only American member of Max Reinhardt's theater company. Weller was named to the Balkan reporting team of \"The New York Times\", and during the 1930s also published two novels, numerous short stories, and freelance journalism from around Europe.\n\nWeller was married twice, first in 1932 to artist Katherine Deupree (1906–1984) of Cincinnati, with whom he had a daughter Ann. They divorced in 1944, and in 1948 he married reporter Charlotte Ebener (1918–1990): their marriage ended with Charlotte's death.\n\nIn 1957, Weller had a second child, Anthony, by the British ballet teacher and scholar Gladys Lasky Weller (1922–1988), with whom he maintained a relationship for over thirty years.\n\nIn December 1940, soon after the beginning of World War II, Weller began working for the \"Chicago Daily News\" Foreign Service and covered the war in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as one of the war's great correspondents, winning a 1943 Pulitzer Prize for his work.\n\nHe wrote a pamphlet \"The Belgian Campaign in Ethiopia\" published by the Belgian Information Center as part of its World War II dissemination of information favorable to Belgium and to Belgium's role in the Belgian Congo, a valuable colony then and for many previous decades. This pamphlet is based on 1941 interviews with Belgian officers who led an army consisting of troops who had been local black police in the Belgian Congo, then Belgium's African colony and originally the personal property of King Leopold of Belgium's royal family. The interviews described and celebrated the surrender of Italian General Gazzera, and were conducted following the conclusion of the Belgian campaign, a \"trek of 2,500 miles through jungle swamps and desert wastes.\" Hardships, heroism and aggressive action against a numerically superior Italian force are reflected as well as the role of the Belgian Congo Army's victory in assisting WWII Allied efforts to oppose the Axis in the colonial sphere. Based on articles first published in the \"Chicago Daily News\", this pamphlet joined such publications as \"King Leopold Vindicated\" in the repertoire of the Belgium Information Center. Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency) officers were involved with United States government and military personnel in securing the supply from the Shinkolobwe mine of most of the uranium critical to production of the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima that brought World War II to an end. Anthony Mockler in his definitive work \"Haile Selassie's War: The Italian-Ethiopian Campaign, 1935–1941\" states that \"troops from the Belgian Congo had reached their 'theatre of operations'—the Baro Salient—in February 1941\".\n\nGeorge Weller reported from Singapore in January 1942. At 8:15 a.m. January 31 the British blew a 70-foot gap in the causeway to Johor. On February 15, 1942, British forces in Singapore surrendered to the Japanese. Giles Playfair, then of the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation, in an entry dated January 29 writes: \"Outside the bank I met George Weller who told me that he was off to Java this afternoon and bade me a fond farewell.\" Weller's reports from Singapore would be published the next year in the book \"Singapore is Silent\".\n\n\"Weller's War\" includes articles which were published (wholly or in part) by \"Chicago Daily News\", \"Boston Globe\"(August 31 and September 1, 1945) and London \"Daily Telegraph\"(September 1, 1945). Weller's reporting on Nagasaki remains one of his lasting legacies.\n\nIn 1946, Weller covered the 1946 Greek war against partisan guerrillas. For many years he covered the Balkans, Mideast and Africa from Rome, where he headed the \"Daily News\" bureau until retiring from the newspaper in 1975.\n\nFrom their base in Rome, Weller's wife Charlotte, herself a newspaper writer, often accompanied him on assignments, including Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nWeller died at his home in San Felice Circeo, Italy, on December 19, 2002 at the age of 95.\n\nIn 1942 Weller interviewed crew members who witnessed an emergency appendectomy performed on by Wheeler Bryson Lipes and other non-doctors, partly with a tea strainer and spoons. Weller won the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting for his December 14, 1942, \"Chicago Daily News\" story \".\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur honored him by conferring a special distinction: \"It is a real pleasure to me to award you the Asiatic-Pacific Service Ribbon in view of your long and meritorious services in the Southwest Pacific Area with the forces of this command. You have added luster to the difficult, dangerous and arduous profession of War Correspondent.\" Weller was also awarded a 1954 George Polk Memorial Award and a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard.\n\nLate in life he received Italy's Premio Internazionale di Giornalismo. He also provided the inspiration for longtime friend Seán Ó Faoláin's 1974 short story \"Something, Everything, Anything, Nothing\".\n\nThe Notes in the book \"The Last Train from Hiroshima\" state: \"As it was, Weller's notes were confiscated and classified. Later, his carbon copies were stored and replicated (in edited form) as internal military and Atomic Energy Commission documents—and in time, they became more or less gospel.\"\n\nIn an article published in the \"Chicago Daily News\", Saturday August 14, 1965, Weller stated, \"The original notes and the original stories are buried in a family attic in New England.\"\n\nIn the foreword to his Weller's final book, \"First Into Nagasaki\", published posthumously in 2006, Walter Cronkite wrote:\n\nThis is an important book—important and gripping. For the first time in print we can read the details of the nuclear bombardment of Nagasaki, Japan, as written by the first American reporter on the terrible scene  ... [George Weller's] reports, so long delayed but now salvaged by his son, at last have saved our history from the military censorship that would have preferred to have time to sanitize the ghastly details  ... Also delayed by MacArthur's censorship were Weller's dispatches from his visits to American prison camps [w]here he uncovered the Japanese military's savage treatment of their American prisoners  ... There is so much in this volume that we never knew or have long forgotten. This volume of the last generation's history is an important reminder, a warning to inspire civilian vigilance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the most famous pupil of Heinrich Isaac, was music director to the court of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and was an influential figure in the development of the Franco-Flemish polyphonic style in Germany.\n\nSenfl was probably born in Basel around 1486, and lived in Zürich from 1488 until 1496, when he joined the choir of the Hofkapelle of Emperor Maximilian I in Augsburg. Apart from one brief visit in 1504 he appears never again to have lived in Switzerland.\n\nIn 1497 he followed the Hofkapelle to Vienna, and between 1500 and 1504 he probably studied in Vienna for three years, the standard practice for choirboys whose voices had broken, as part of the normal training for the priesthood. During this period he studied with Heinrich Isaac, serving as his copyist by 1509; he is known to have copied much of the older composer's \"Choralis Constantinus\", an enormous work which he was later to complete after Isaac's death.\n\nAfter a trip to Italy sometime between 1508 and 1510, Senfl returned to the Hofkapelle; the Emperor appointed him to fill Isaac's position as court composer when Isaac died in 1517. In 1518 Senfl lost a toe in a hunting accident; evidently the injury disabled him for up to a year. When the Emperor died in 1519, Senfl was out of a job, and his circumstances altered for the worse: Charles V dismissed most of Maximilian's musicians, and even refused to pay Senfl the annual stipend which had been promised to him in the event of the emperor's death. During the next few years he traveled widely, mainly job-seeking, but he was also active as a composer. He is known to have attended the Diet of Worms in 1521, and, while he never officially became a Protestant, his sympathies evidently were with Luther, and he was later examined by the Inquisition and voluntarily gave up his priesthood. Senfl carried on an extensive correspondence both with Lutheran Duke Albrecht of Prussia and with Martin Luther himself, beginning in 1530.\n\nEventually Senfl acquired a post in Munich, a place which had high musical standards, a strong need for new music, and which was relatively tolerant of those with Protestant sympathies; he was to remain there for the rest of his life. By 1540 he was ill, judging from his correspondence with Duke Albrecht, and he probably died in early 1543.\n\nSenfl was an eclectic composer, at home both in the worlds of sacred and secular music, and he modeled his style carefully on models provided by the Franco-Flemish composers of the previous generation, especially Josquin des Prez. In particular, he was a gifted melodist, and his lines are warmly lyrical; his music remained popular and influential in Germany through the 17th century.\n\nHis sacred music includes masses, motets, vespers settings, and a Magnificat. Technically his music has many archaic features, such as the use of \"cantus firmus\" technique, which was more in vogue in the 15th century; he even occasionally employs isorhythm. However he also has a typically Germanic liking for singable melodic passages in parallel imperfect intervals (3rds and 6ths).\n\nSenfl also wrote numerous German lieder, most of them secular (the handful on sacred texts were written for Duke Albrecht of Prussia). They vary widely in character, from extremely simple settings of a \"cantus firmus\" to contrapuntal tours-de-force such as elaborate canons and quodlibets.\n\n\n\n"}

The school was built in 2003 and was named after Todd Morgan Beamer, a passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was one of the passengers who attempted to foil the hijacking and reclaim the aircraft, which crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The school was opened in September 2003.\n\nTodd Beamer Campus received a $675,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for staff development during the school's first three years.\n\nThe school has three separate academies as of 2012, each named for one of the school colors and with its own choice of teachers and electives. The three academies are the Blue Academy (previously Puget Sound Business and Industry Academy); Green Academy (previously the Math, Science, Health and Fitness Academy); and Silver Academy (previously the School of Global Leadership & Economics).\n\nA fourth academy, the Northwest College Preparatory Academy, was created in 2005, but was merged with the other three academies in 2009 due to budget and teacher cuts.\n\nTodd Beamer's sports teams are called the Titans and compete in the Olympic Division of the North Puget Sound League.\nTodd Beamer's men's soccer team won the 4A State Championship in 2017, with an astounding 19–1–1 record, beating Pasco 2–1, in the 4A State Championship. The soccer 4A title was the School's first State title in any sport, in their history since its opening in September 2003.\n\nTBHS made national news as a student brought three guns to school on April 19, 2007, just three days after The Virginia Tech Massacre. The school was put into a lockdown for an hour.\n\nAfter a Todd Beamer High School student followed up a campaign promise by swallowing a live goldfish, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticised the school. PETA felt that \"people who harm small animals, often go on to harm larger animals or even people.\" The incident made statewide news, and eventually onto national news. Radio talk shows hosts such as Howard Stern suggested that the incident was blown out of proportion.\n\nIn December 2008, TBHS was subjected to 3 consecutive days of repeated arson in several of the school's bathrooms. It began on Monday, December 8, where a purposeful fire was created in a bathroom's trash can. This also occurred the next day, December 9; and the day after, December 10. All students were safely evacuated each day and none were injured. Principal Liz Drake made announcements throughout the week over the intercom to keep students calm. The school received some minor repairable damages from the incident. The students responsible for the fires were caught and dealt with by the police. This event led to the installation of security cameras in Beamer's hallways.\n\nThe building was designed as an assemblage of structures around a central courtyard, similar to a village, to reinforce more personalized smaller groupings and recall the historic rural settlement patterns of the area. Learning spaces were designed to be highly flexible and convertible to accommodate changing methodologies and technology. The project was designed by Bassetti Architects to accommodate an easy conversion of the school into departmental-, academy-, grade-, or project-based learning models. The innovative design was recognized as a finalist for the James D. MacConnell Award by the Association for Learning Environments in 2004.\n\n"}

{"id": "2079265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079265", "title": "Undeletion", "text": "Undeletion\n\nUndeletion is a feature for restoring computer files which have been removed from a file system by file deletion. Deleted data can be recovered on many file systems, but not all file systems provide an undeletion feature. Recovering data without an undeletion facility is usually called data recovery, rather than undeletion. Although undeletion can help prevent users from accidentally losing data, it can also pose a computer security risk, since users may not be aware that deleted files remain accessible.\n\nNot all file systems or operating systems support undeletion. Undeletion is possible on all FAT file systems, with undeletion utilities provided since MS-DOS 5.0 and DR DOS 6.0 in 1991. It is not supported by most modern UNIX file systems, though AdvFS is a notable exception. The ext2 file system has an add-on program called e2undel which allows file undeletion. The similar ext3 file system does not officially support undeletion, but utilities like ext4magic, extundelete, PhotoRec and ext3grep was written to automate the undeletion on ext3 volumes. Undelete was proposed in ext4, but is yet to be implemented. However, a trash bin feature was posted as a patch on December 4, 2006. The Trash bin feature uses undelete\nattributes in ext2/3/4 and Reiser file systems.\n\nNorton UNERASE was an important component in Norton Utilities version 1.0 in 1982.\n\nMicrosoft included a similar UNDELETE program in versions 5.0 to 6.22 of MS-DOS, but applied the Recycle Bin approach instead in later operating systems using FAT.\n\nDR DOS 6.0 and higher support UNDELETE as well, but optionally offer additional protection utilizing the FAT snapshot utility DISKMAP and the resident DELWATCH deletion tracking component, which actively maintains deleted files' date and time stamps and keeps the contents of deleted files from being overwritten unless running out of disk space. DELWATCH also supports undeletion of remote files on file servers. Since Novell DOS 7 the kernel will store the first letter of deleted files in the directory entries in order to further assist undeletion tools in recovering the original name.\n\nPTS-DOS offers the same feature, configurable by a SAVENAME CONFIG.SYS directive.\n\nThe FreeDOS version of UNDELETE was developed by Eric Auer and is licensed under the GPL.\n\nGraphical user environments often take a different approach to undeletion, instead using a \"holding area\" for files to be deleted. Undesired files are moved to this holding area, and all of the files in the holding area are deleted periodically or when a user requests it. This approach is used by the \"Trash can\" in Macintosh operating systems and by the recycle bin in Microsoft Windows. This is a natural continuation of the approach taken by earlier systems, such as the limbo group used by LocoScript. This approach is not subject to the risk that other files being written to the filesystem will disrupt a deleted file very quickly; permanent deletion will happen on a predictable schedule or with manual intervention only.\n\nAnother approach is offered by programs such as \"Norton GoBack\" (formerly \"Roxio GoBack\"): a portion of the hard disk space is set aside for file modification operations to be recorded in such a way that they may later be undone. This process is usually much safer in aiding recovery of deleted files than the undeletion operation as described below.\n\nSimilarly, file systems that support \"snapshots\" (like ZFS or btrfs), can be used to make snapshots of the whole file system at regular intervals (e.g. every hour), thus allowing recovery of files from an earlier snapshot.\n\nUndeletion is not fail-safe. In general, the sooner undeletion is attempted, the more likely it will be successful. This is because the more a system is used, the more data is written to the drive and potentially allocated to that deleted space. Fragmentation of the deleted file may also reduce the probability of recovery, depending on the type of file system (see below). A fragmented file is scattered across different parts of the disk, instead of being in a contiguous area.\n\nThe workings of undeletion depend on the file system on which the deleted file was stored. Some file systems, such as HFS, cannot provide an undeletion feature because no information about the deleted file is retained (except by additional software, which is not usually present). Some file systems, however, do not erase all traces of a deleted file, including FAT file systems:\n\nWhen a file is \"deleted\" using a FAT file system, the directory entry remains almost unchanged except for the first character of the file name, preserving most of the \"deleted\" file's name, along with its time stamp, file length and — most importantly — its physical location on the disk. The list of disk clusters occupied by the file will, however, be erased from the \"File Allocation Table\", marking those sectors available for use by other files created or modified thereafter. In case of FAT32, it is additionally erased field responsible for upper 16 bits of file start cluster value.\n\nWhen undeletion operation is attempted, the following conditions must be met for a successful recovery of the file:\n\nChances of recovering deleted files is often higher on FAT12 and FAT16 as compared to FAT32 volumes due to the typically larger cluster sizes used by the former systems and due to loss of upper 16 bits of logical cluster address for FAT32.\n\nIf the undeletion program cannot detect clear signs of the above requirements not being met, it will restore the directory entry as being in use and mark all consecutive clusters, beginning with the one as recorded in the old directory entry, as used in the \"File Allocation Table\". It is then up to the user to open the recovered file and to verify that it contains the complete data of the formerly deleted file.\n\nRecovery of fragmented files (after the first fragment) is therefore not normally possible by automatic processes, only by manual examination of each (unused) block of the disk. This requires detailed knowledge of the file system, as well as the binary format of the file type being recovered, and is therefore only done by recovery specialists or forensics professionals.\n\nNTFS stores file information as a set of fixed-size records (typically, 1KB) within the so-called Master File Table (MFT). File name and file allocation information are encapsulated into these records, providing complete information about each specific file. When the system deletes a file, the entry in the Master File Table is released to be either unlinked or reused, but it still remains on disk.\nUntil the MFT entry is reused or overwritten, the file can be easily recovered: data recovery software can find the \"lost\" MFT entry and derive full information about the lost file from it.\n\nNote however, when the SSD TRIM function is enabled, file content may be destroyed shortly after deletion to reuse SSD memory cells.

The song has since been covered by many artists, with the most famous cover being attributed to The Jackson 5.\n\nThe original recording by Jimmy Boyd, recorded on July 15, 1952, when he was 13 years old, reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" pop singles chart in December 1952, and on the \"Cash Box\" chart at the beginning of the following year. It later reached Number 3 in the UK Charts when issued there in November 1953. The song was commissioned by Saks Fifth Avenue to promote the store's Christmas card for the year, which featured an original sketch by artist Perry Barlow, who drew for \"The New Yorker\" for many decades.\n\nThe song describes a scene where a child walks downstairs from his bedroom on Christmas Eve to see the mother kissing \"Santa Claus\" under the mistletoe. The lyric concludes with the child wondering how his father will react on hearing of the kiss, little knowing it is in fact his father in the Santa costume.\n\nBoyd's record was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church in Boston when it was released on the grounds that it mixed kissing with Christmas. Boyd was photographed meeting with the Archdiocese to explain the song. After the meeting, the ban was lifted.\n\nA less successful version of the song was released in 1952 by Spike Jones (with vocal by George Rock in the little boy voice used in Spike's hit \"All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth\"). Jones also recorded a parody for his personal pleasure titled \"I Saw Mommy Screwing Santa Claus.\"\n\nPopular versions of the song were released by the Ronettes, Molly Bee, Bobby Sherman, Andy Williams, The Beverley Sisters, The Four Seasons, The Jackson 5, Reba McEntire, Homer and Jethro, Amy Winehouse, John Mellencamp, Mitch Miller, John Prine, Sammi Sanchez, Tiny Tim, The Cheetah Girls, Ray Stevens, Bif Naked, Jessica Simpson, Teresa Brewer, Rica Fukami, Secret Chiefs 3 and Dionne Bromfield have also covered it. The Dollyrots recorded a variation (titled \"I Saw Mommy Biting Santa Claus\") with humorous lyrics. RuPaul and Kip Addotta both recorded versions with changed lyrics titled \"I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus.\" Twisted Sister recorded their own variation of the song onto their album \"A Twisted Christmas\". \n\nJohn Mellencamp also filmed a music video to promote his recording for the 1987 Special Olympics charity album, \"A Very Special Christmas\".\n\nOn December 14, 2019, Saturday Night Live sketch featured a version of \"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\". It was sung by Cecily Strong portraying a child, it also featured Scarlett Johansson as mother, Beck Bennett as Santa Claus, and Mikey Day as father. In addition, the sketch added extra lyrics that makes the sketch darker.\n\n\nA made-for-television movie based on the song was released in 2001.\n\n"}

KuPS plays in Finland's Premier League, Veikkausliiga. The team plays its home matches at Savon Sanomat Areena. Until June 2005, KuPS used to play at an aged track and field stadium in Väinölänniemi, which is said to be one of the most beautiful sporting places in Finland. Väinölänniemi is a cape surrounded by a local lake, Kallavesi.\n\nKuPS has won the Finnish championship six times, the Finnish Cup 2 times and the Finnish League Cup once. KuPS also holds the Finnish club record of the most consecutive seasons in the top flight, from 1949 to 1992. The team is placed fourth in the all-time Finnish premier league honour table.\n\nOne of the first sports clubs in Kuopio to adopt football was Kuopion Reipas who made the sport an official part of their program in 1915. Reipas was a general athletic society which competed in a wide variety of sports like track and field, gymnastics, skiing as well as team sports like bandy. After the Finnish Civil War of 1918 the differing interests of the disciplines began to cause friction within the club which resulted in the club gradually breaking apart during the 1920s. Among the clubs that emerged from Reipas was KuPS, officially founded on March 16th 1923 at Kuopion Seurahuone. Ali Rautakorpi was elected as the club's first chairman. Other sports participated in by the club during its early years were pesäpallo, tennis and bandy. \n\nThe 1920s KuPS spent mostly by playing friendly games against other local clubs. First major breakthrough came in 1930 when KuPS won the Savo district championship thereby earning promotion to B-sarja, the second tier of Finnish football at the time, where they remained until 1947 when they were promoted to Mestaruussarja for the first time. KuPS's first stint in the Finnish top division lasted only a single season, but they were promoted again in 1949 and this time remained in the top division for 44 seasons. \n\nKuPS returned to the top flight for the 2005 season after a year in the First Division (Ykkönen).\nThey finished the 2005 season in 10th place, easily avoiding the relegation play-off (13th place) and direct relegation (14th place).\n\nOn 1 April 2006 KuPS beat reigning Veikkausliiga champions, MyPa 1–0 in the semi-final of the Finnish League Cup and secured a place in the Finnish League Cup Final. On 12 April 2006 in Finnair Stadium, Helsinki KuPS beat FC KooTeePee 2–1 in the League Cup Final and ended their 17-year run without titles. However, the club ended the 2006 season in last place, and was once again demoted to \"Ykkönen\" for the 2007 season. This resulted in manager Juha Malinen being replaced by his former player/assistant manager Kai Nyyssönen.\n\nReserve team, KuPS Akatemia (tr: KuPS Academy) played in the Second Division Group A (Kakkonen lohko A), but the team was terminated in December 2006 to cut costs and as a replacement, an agreement with Kings Kuopio, which plays also in the Second Division was signed.\n\nIn December 2006, it was revealed that the team was heavily in debt and about to go bankrupt. KuPS fans held their breath, until a Helsinki-based CEO of an Investment bank ICECAPITAL, also a former Chairman of the Board of the Veikkausliiga, Ari Lahti increased his stake at the club to ca. 95% and saved the club.\n\nAfter escaping imminent destruction, season 2007 began with reasonably low expectations. A target to achieve promotion back to top flight in two years was set.\n\nManager Kai Nyyssönen lured his former team-mate Harri Ylönen back to strengthen the team and to serve as an assistant manager. The duo lured in Roope Reinikainen, Ilja Venäläinen and Miikka Turunen, who also returned to their former home club.\nJussi Hakasalo from JJK Jyväskylä and Tero Mäkäläinen from MyPa were new names.\n\nBecause of relegation KuPS lost its prized assets, Sierraleonese players, Patrick Bantamoi to FC Inter Turku and Medo to HJK. KuPS and Ghanaian midfielder Seth Ablade parted their ways earlier, with Ablade terminating his contract.\n\nSeason 2007 started well with mostly local players. The team suffered a run of draws in the mid-season, but by winning their last six games with their main opponent RoPS of Rovaniemi at the same time losing its lead, KuPS won the league Ykkönen and went straight back. RoPS also achieved a promotion, by winning a promotion play-off against 13th-place finisher of Veikkausliiga, FC Viikingit.\n\n\"As of July 11, 2019.\"\n\nMestaruussarja/Veikkausliiga\n\nFinnish Cup\n\nFinnish League Cup\n\nYkkönen (second tier)\n\nKakkonen (third tier)\n\n\n\n"}

She was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her novel \"Persian Nights\" in 1988.\n\nBorn Diane Lain in Moline, Illinois, Johnson has authored books including \"Lulu in Marrakech\" (2008), \"L'Affaire\" (2003), \"Le Mariage\" (2000) and \"Le Divorce\" (1997), for which she was a National Book Award finalist and the winner of the California Book Award gold medal for fiction. Her memoir \"Flyover Lives\" was released in January 2014.\n\nShe has been a frequent contributor to \"The New York Review of Books\" since the mid-1970s. With filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, Johnson co-authored the screenplay to \"The Shining\" (1980), based on the horror novel of the same name by Stephen King.\n\nIn 2003, \"Le Divorce\", a film adaptation of her comedy of manners novel of the same name, was released, directed by James Ivory and starred Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts.\n\nJohnson attended Stephens College, a small women's college in Missouri. In her sophomore year she entered the \"Mademoiselle\" magazine Guest Editor contest and was selected as one of 20 women from across the United States to work on the magazine for a month in New York City in 1953. The month at the magazine would prove to be formative in her eventual career as a writer. Another member of the group was Sylvia Plath who would write about the experience in her novel \"The Bell Jar\". \n\nJohnson shadowed the Health and Beauty editor and was responsible for answering readers' questions about makeup. In a piece she wrote for the September 2003 edition of \"Vogue\" magazine, Johnson said, \"I still have a strong memory of Plath's white straw beret, her blonde pageboy and cheerful face. (None of us understood the anguish of her secret life, though maybe the editors did, for they treated her carefully, the one most destined to succeed.)\" \n\nIn the \"Vogue\" article, Johnson wrote the month at \"Mademoiselle\" and her exposure to Plath taught her a key lesson. \"I realized that if you took pains with your writing, you could make art, and that the rather facile little stories I had dashed off for my English classes or the school magazine were probably not art. It was, in fact, the example of \"Sunday at the Mintons',\" Sylvia Plath's winning story in the Guest Editor contest, that made that point to me and changed my life, though not immediately.\" \n\nJohnson went on to say, \"Writing was a serious form of work, and to be serious, like those New York editors, you had to send in your stories. Writers and editors were embarked on a consequential enterprise, the business of literature and books. What happiness to have been taught that lesson; I did send in my novels.\"\n\nThat same year, 1953, Johnson married B. Lamar Johnson Jr.. Within eight years, she had given birth to four children with him: Kevin, Darcy, Amanda, and Simon. In the \"Vogue\" article she wrote, \"Novel-writing would become my refuge during moments snatched during their naps and play visits. New York..came to symbolize a road not taken, but I was not sorry, exactly, for if I had stayed in New York, I probably would not have done my writing.\"\n\nAfter separating from and divorcing Johnson, in 1968 she married John Frederic Murray, a physician who became chief of pulmonary and critical care at San Francisco General Hospital. Since his retirement, they have divided their time between homes in San Francisco and in Paris, where Murray died of Covid-19 in March 2020 at the age of 92.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079286", "title": "Ancient Greek dialects", "text": "Ancient Greek dialects\n\nAncient Greek in classical antiquity, before the development of the common Koine Greek of the Hellenistic period, was divided into several varieties. \n\nMost of these varieties are known only from inscriptions, but a few of them, principally Aeolic, Doric, and Ionic, are also represented in the literary canon alongside the dominant Attic form of literary Greek.\n\nLikewise, Modern Greek is divided into several dialects, most derived from Koine Greek.\n\n\nAncient Greek literature is written in literary dialects that developed from particular regional or archaic dialects. Ancient Greek authors did not necessarily write in their native dialect, but rather chose a dialect that was suitable or traditional for the type of literature they were writing (see belles-lettres). All dialects have poetry written in them, but only Attic and Ionic have full works of prose attested.\n\nHomeric Greek is used in the first epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and the Homeric Hymns, traditionally attributed to Homer and written in dactylic hexameter. Homeric is a literary dialect with elements of Ionic, Aeolic and Arcadocypriot. Hesiod uses a similar dialect, and later writers imitate Homer in their epics, such as Apollonius Rhodius in Argonautica and Nonnus in Dionysiaca. Homer influenced other types of poetry as well.\n\nIonic proper is first used in Archilochus of Paros. This dialect includes also the earliest Greek prose, that of Heraclitus and Ionic philosophers, Hecataeus and logographers, Herodotus, Democritus, and Hippocrates. Elegiac poetry originated in Ionia and always continued to be written in Ionic.\n\nDoric is the conventional dialect of choral lyric poetry, which includes the Laconian Alcman, the Theban Pindar and the choral songs of Attic tragedy (stasima). Several lyric and epigrammatic poets wrote in this dialect, such as Ibycus of Rhegium and Leonidas of Tarentum. The following authors wrote in Doric, preserved in fragments: Epicharmus comic poet and writers of South Italian Comedy (phlyax play), Mithaecus food writer and Archimedes.\n\nAeolic is an exclusively poetic lyric dialect, represented by Sappho and Alcaeus for Lesbian (Aeolic) and Corinna of Tanagra for Boeotian.\n\nThessalic (Aeolic), Northwest Doric, Arcado-Cypriot and Pamphylian never became literary dialects and are only known from inscriptions, and to some extent by the comical parodies of Aristophanes and lexicographers.\n\nAttic proper was used by the Attic orators, Lysias, Isocrates, Aeschines and Demosthenes, the philosophers Plato and Aristotle and the historian Xenophon. Thucydides wrote in Old Attic. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides wrote in an artificial poetic language, and the comic playwright Aristophanes wrote in a language with vernacular elements.\n\nThe ancients classified the language into three \"gene\" or four dialects: Ionic proper, Ionic (Attic), Aeolic, Doric and later a fifth one, Koine. Grammarians focus mainly on the literary dialects and isolated words. Historians may classify dialects on mythological/historical reasons rather than linguistic knowledge. According to Strabo, \"Ionic is the same as Attic and Aeolic the same as Doric - Outside the Isthmus, all Greeks were Aeolians except the Athenians, the Megarians and the Dorians who live about Parnassus - In the Peloponnese, Achaeans were also Aeolians but only Eleans and Arcadians continued to speak Aeolic\". However, for most ancients, Aeolic was synonymous with literary Lesbic. Stephanus of Byzantium characterized Boeotian as Aeolic and Aetolian as Doric. Remarkable is the ignorance of sources, except lexicographers, on Arcadian, Cypriot and Pamphylian.\n\nFinally, unlike Modern Greek and English, Ancient Greek common terms for human speech ( 'glôssa', 'dialektos', 'phônê' and the suffix '-isti' ) may be attributed interchangeably to both a dialect and a language. However, the plural 'dialektoi' is used when dialects and peculiar words are compared and listed by the grammarians under the terms 'lexeis' or 'glôssai'.\n\nThe dialects of Classical Antiquity are grouped slightly differently by various authorities. Pamphylian is a marginal dialect of Asia Minor and is sometimes left uncategorized. Mycenaean was deciphered only in 1952 and so is missing from the earlier schemes presented here:\n\nThe Ancient Greek dialects differed mainly in vowels.\n\nLoss of intervocalic \"s\" and consonantal \"i\" and \"w\" from Proto-Greek brought two vowels together in hiatus, a circumstance often called a \"collision of vowels\". Over time, Greek speakers would change pronunciation to avoid such a collision, and the way that vowels changed determined the dialect.\n\nFor example, the word for the \"god of the sea\" (regardless of the culture and language from which it came) was in some prehistoric form \"*poseidāwōn\" (genitive \"*poseidāwonos\"). Loss of the intervocalic *\"w\" left \"poseidāōn\", which is found in both Mycenaean and Homeric dialects. Ionic Greek changed the *\"a\" to an e (\"poseideōn\"), while Attic Greek contracted it to \"poseidōn\". It changed differently in other dialects:\n\nThe changes appear designed to place one vowel phoneme instead of two, a process called \"contraction\", if a third phoneme is created, and \"hyphaeresis\" (\"taking away\") if one phoneme is dropped and the other kept. Sometimes, the two phonemes are kept, sometimes modified, as in the Ionic \"poseideōn\".\n\nA vowel shift differentiating the Ionic and Attic dialects from the rest was the shift of \"ā\" () to \"ē\" (). In Ionic, the change occurred in all positions, but in Attic, it occurred almost everywhere except after \"e\", \"i\", and \"r\" (). Homeric Greek shows the Ionic rather than the Attic version of the vowel shift for the most part. Doric and Aeolic show the original forms with \"ā\" ().\n\nAnother principle of vocalic dialectization follows the Indo-European ablaut series or vowel grades. The Proto-Indo-European language could interchange \"e\" (e-grade) with \"o\" (o-grade) or use neither (zero-grade). Similarly, Greek inherited the series, for example, \"ei\", \"oi\", \"i\", which are e-, o- and zero-grades of the diphthong respectively. They could appear in different verb forms – present \"leípō\" () \"I leave\", perfect \"léloipa\" () \"I have left\", aorist \"élipon\" () \"I left\" – or be used as the basis of dialectization: Attic \"deíknȳmi\" () \"I point out\" but Cretan \"díknūmi\" ().\n\nThe ancient Greek dialects were a result of isolation and poor communication between communities living in broken terrain. All general Greek historians point out the influence of terrain on the development of the city-states. Often, the development of languages dialectization results in the dissimilation of daughter languages. That phase did not occur in Greek; instead the dialects were replaced by Standard Greek.\n\nIncreasing population and communication brought speakers more closely in touch and united them under the same authorities. Attic Greek became the literary language everywhere. Buck says:\n\nIn the last few centuries BC, regional dialects replaced local ones: Northwest Greek koine, Doric koine and Attic koine. The last came to replace the others in common speech in the first few centuries AD. After the division of the Roman Empire the earliest Modern Greek prevailed, although a version of Attic Greek was still exclusively taught in schools and served as the official language of the state until the early 20th century. The dialect distribution was then as follows:\n\nAccording to some scholars, Tsakonian is the only modern Greek dialect that descends from Doric, albeit with some influence from the Koine. Others include the Southern Italian dialects in this group, though perhaps they should rather be regarded as descended from the local Doric-influenced variant of the Koine.\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Cheltenham College.\n\nAfter attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Gallwey was commissioned in 1878. He served as an aide-de-camp to the governors of Bermuda, being promoted to captain in 1887.\n\nGallwey was appointed deputy commissioner and vice-consul in the newly established Oil Rivers Protectorate (later the Niger Coast Protectorate) in 1891. In March 1892, he failed to convince the King of Benin, Omo n’Oba Ovonramwen, into signing a deceptive 'treaty of friendship' that would make Benin a British colony. Instead, the King issued an edict barring all British officials and traders from entering Benin territories. The 'Gallwey Treaty', although it was never signed, became the legal basis for the British invasion, occupation, and looting, culminating in the Benin Expedition of 1897, which destroyed the Kingdom of Benin. Gallwey was often mentioned in despatches during this time, and was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO; 1896), appointment as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG; 1899) and promotion to major (1897).\n\nGallwey was attached as a political officer to the staff of the British Field Force during the Aro-Anglo war from November 1901 until March 1902 and was mentioned in despatches by the High Commissioner to Southern Nigeria.\n\nGiven the rank of lieutenant colonel when he was placed on half-pay in 1901, Gallwey retired from the army in 1902.\n\nAfter retiring from the army, Gallwey was appointed as governor of the island of Saint Helena, where he revived capital punishment. Appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1910, he was transferred to Gambia in 1911.\n\nGalway was appointed Governor of South Australia in 1914. He resented the limitations placed upon a constitutional governor, and his governorship was defined by controversy. He managed to anger a wide spectrum of the population. The general public disliked his support of compulsory military training; puritans were angered by his support for gambling and his opposition to prohibition; progressives were infuriated by his opposition to women's enfranchisement; and the political establishment were aghast at his opposition to the White Australia Policy (on the grounds that the Northern Territory needed Asian workers). For this last opinion, he was forced to issue a full retraction and apology. A speech in 1915 in which Galway suggested that trade unionists should be conscripted and sent to the front was widely criticised and gave local cartoonists a field day.\n\nIt was eventually Galway's support for conscription that saved his governorship; the legislature decided that his efforts to increase voluntary recruitment for the First World War, as well as his support for conscription referendums, warranted keeping him in the role. A motion in the legislature by the Labor opposition in 1917 calling for the abolition of his office failed.\n\nAfter the war, Premier Archibald Peake was considering a proposal to build a national war memorial on the site of Government House, with a new vice-regal residence to be purchased in the suburbs. Galway managed to dissuade Peake from this scheme, and the war memorial was built in a corner of the grounds of Government House.\n\nGalway's appointment was not renewed when it expired in 1920; although he was liked by the Adelaide establishment, he had been a spectacularly controversial governor, and the Colonial Office did not give him another post. He returned to England later in 1920.\n\nIn 1911, Gallwey changed his surname to \"Galway\". On 26 August 1913 in London he married Baroness Marie Carola Franciska Roselyne d'Erlanger. He died on 17 June 1949.\n"}

Osborn acted as manager of BDO's Buffalo branch. He was largely responsible for the 1928 merger of BDO (Barton, Durstine & Osborn) with the George Batten Company to create BBDO.\n\nAfter years of success and having survived the Great Depression, BBDO underwent a crisis in 1938, losing many of its clients and key personnel. Osborn commuted to New York City and eventually saved the company by securing the Goodrich tire account. In 1939, he became BBDO's executive vice president after Durstine resigned. Osborn was crucial in recruiting many top employees, including Ben Duffy, who eventually became the president of BBDO.\n\nOsborn became increasingly active as an author, and published several books on creative thinking. In his 1942 book \"How To Think Up\" he presented the technique of \"brainstorming\", which had been used at BBDO. Eventually, Osborn's writing career overtook his work in advertising, and in 1960, after more than forty years, he resigned from BBDO's board of directors.\n\nIn 1954, Osborn set up the Creative Education Foundation, sustained by the royalties earned from his books. Along with Sidney Parnes, Osborn developed the \"Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process\" (commonly referred to as CPS). He co-founded the Creative Education Foundation's Creative Problem Solving Institute, the world's longest-running international creativity conference, and CPS has been taught for more than 50 years.\n\n\nOsborn also contributed frequently to trade publications such as \"Printer's Ink\".\n\nOn September 15, 1916, he married Helen Coatsworth, the daughter of a wealthy Buffalo lawyer.

Among her songs, \"Bello e impossibile\" (1986) was an international hit in Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.\n\nNannini was born in Siena on 14 July 1956. She is the older sister of former Formula One racing driver Alessandro Nannini. She studied piano and composition in Milan in the late 1970s and obtained a degree in Philosophy from the University of Siena in 1994. The following year she took part in a protest organized by Greenpeace at the French embassy in Rome against the decision of the French government to pursue nuclear experiments at Mururoa.\n\nNannini scored her first domestic hit in 1979 with the single \"America\" and the album \"California\", which became a success in several European countries. Her international breakthrough happened in 1984 with the release of her sixth album, the Conny Plank-produced \"Puzzle\", which peaked in the top 10 in the Italian, German, Austrian and Swiss charts. The first single from the album, \"Fotoromanza\", was supported by a music video directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, and went on to win many musical awards. Nannini embarked on a long European tour to support the album, culminating in a headlining gig at the Montreux Jazz Festival.\n\nIn 1986, her song \"Bello e impossibile\" was a European hit in Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Her 1987 compilation album \"Maschi e Altri\" sold over a million copies.\n\nIn 2004, she released the greatest hits album \"Perle\", where a number of her most renowned songs were rearrangemed with the support of musicians such as Christian Lohr on piano (who also had a co-producer credit), and a string quartet composed of Vincenzo di Donna (first violin), Luigi de Maio (second violin), Gerardo Morrone (viola) and Antonio di Franca (violoncello). With this orchestra Nannini went on a European tour from 2004 to 2005.\n\nThe album \"Grazie\" was released in February 2006, and peaked at number one of the Italian hit-parade with the single \"Sei nell'anima\".\n\nIn April 2007, Nannini released \"Pia come la canto io\", a collection of songs produced by Wil Malone and originally intended for a rock opera based on the medieval Tuscan character Pia de' Tolomei (briefly mentioned in Dante's Purgatorio) that would eventually be performed in 2008 after eleven years of gestation.\n\nAn acoustic version of her song \"Meravigliosa Creatura\" (from \"Perle\") has been used in a 2008 advertisement commercial for the Fiat Bravo directed by Matthias Zentner. Fiat would later include another Gianna Nannini song, \"Aria\", in a subsequent Fiat Bravo ad.\n\nIn 1987 she performed with Sting and Jack Bruce the \"Three Penny Opera\" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill at the Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. In 1990, she and Edoardo Bennato sang \"Un'estate italiana\", the official song of the Football World Cup 1990 composed by Giorgio Moroder. In September 2006, she recorded the single \"Ama Credi E Vai\" with Andrea Bocelli. Nannini was also featured on Einstürzende Neubauten member Alexander Hacke's solo album \"Sanctuary\", on the track \"Per Sempre Butterfly\". In 2008 she duetted with the Italian rapper Fabri Fibra in his videoclip version of the song \"In Italia\". She also sang the song \"Aria\" with the Macedonian vocalist Toše Proeski.\n\n\nIn August 2010, at the age of 56, she announced that she was pregnant. Nannini's pregnancy was prominently featured on the cover of \"Vanity Fair\", where she was portraited wearing a T-shirt with the inscription ‘God is a Woman’. On 26 November 2010 at 12 AM Nannini's daughter Penelope Jane Charlotte was born at the Madonnina Clinic in Milan. In 2017, Nannini decided to move to London with her partner, Carla. In her 2017 autobiography, entitled \"Cazzi miei\", she revealed she was ready for a civil union with Carla, explaining she felt Italian laws could not give her any warranty about Penelope's future in the case of her (Nannini's) death.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079341", "title": "Amidar", "text": "Amidar\n\nAmidar is a video game developed by Konami and released in arcades in 1981 by Stern. The format is similar to that of \"Pac-Man\": the player moves around a fixed rectilinear lattice, attempting to visit each location on the board while avoiding the enemies. When each spot has been visited, the player moves to the next level. The game and its name have their roots in the Japanese lot drawing game Amidakuji. The bonus level in Amidar is a nearly exact replication of an Amidakuji game and the way the enemies move conform to the Amidakuji rules; this is referred to in the attract sequence as \"Amidar movement.\"\n\n\"Amidar\" was the first in the grid capture sub-genre of maze games and was highly cloned in arcades and for home systems.\n\nAs in \"Pac-Man\", the player is opposed by enemies who kill on contact. The enemies gradually increase in number as the player advances from one level to the next, and their speed also increases.\nOn odd-numbered levels, the player controls an ape (in some versions labeled \"Copier\"), and must collect coconuts while avoiding headhunters (labeled \"Police\" and \"Thief\"). On even-numbered levels, the player controls a paint roller (labeled \"Rustler\"), and must paint over each spot of the board while avoiding pigs (labeled \"Cattle\" and \"Thief\"). Each level is followed by a short bonus stage.\n\nWhenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is colored in, and in the even levels, bonus points are awarded (In odd-numbered levels, the player collects points for each coconut eaten). When the player clears all four corners of the board, he is briefly empowered to kill the enemies by touching them (just as when \"Pac-Man\" uses a \"power pill\"). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and revitalise themselves after a few moments.\n\nThe game controls consist of a joystick and a single button labeled \"Jump,\" which can be used up to three times, resetting after a level is cleared or the player loses a life. Pressing the jump button does not cause the player to jump, but causes all the enemies to jump, enabling the player to walk under them.\n\nExtra lives are given at 50,000 points, and per 80,000 scored up to 930,000; after that, no more lives.\n\nThe enemies (and bonus stage pigs) in \"Amidar\" move deterministically; this is described in the game as \"Amidar movement\". Each normal-type enemy moves vertically from the top to the bottom of the screen, and then back to the top, and so on. While moving in a constant vertical direction, the enemy will take every horizontal turn available until they reach the top or bottom of the grid, when they will continue to move either left or right in the direction they are headed and then take the first vertical turn available to re-enter the game board. This ensures that, while the movement of the enemies can be predicted and avoided, there are no safe points on the grid in which the player can stay still for too long. Each level has one special enemy (the \"Tracer\", colored white) which, at the beginning of each stage, simply patrols around the perimeter of the gameboard in an anti-clockwise direction. However, following a certain number of \"laps\", The Tracer will begin to relentlessly pursue the player by following the path their on-screen avatar takes. While the Tracer cannot deviate from following the player's exact route, it does not mimic any pauses the player makes, meaning that hesitations or backtracking will eventually allow the Tracer to catch up and kill the player. Later levels increase difficulty by adding more complex game grids, adding more enemies, and reducing the delay before the Tracer begins pursuit, until eventually it gives chase after a single lap at the beginning of each stage.\n\nIn the even-numbered levels where the player controls a paint roller, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines which are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. In practical terms, this means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level (which always has a fresh supply of paint) and spread outwards, rather than completing squares in any part of the game board they please, as they can on the odd-numbered levels. This also makes filling the corner rectangles and becoming invincible more difficult.\n\n\"Amidar\" was published by Parker Bros. for the Atari 2600 in 1982 and the Casio PV-1000 console in 1983. Gakken released a handheld version of \"Amidar\" in 1982. It was one of a series of three flip-top games with VFD screen and magnifying Fresnel lens.\n\nA reskinned version, \"Spiderdroid\", was published for the Atari 2600 in 1987 by Froggo. A clone was published as \"Omidar\" by Profiteam/M&T for the Commodore 64 in 1987.\n\n\"Triple Punch\" is a horizontally scrolling version of the \"Amidar\" concept.\n\nThere are two ROM sets for Amidar: a harder version distributed by Stern and an easier set created by Konami. According to Twin Galaxies, Scott Karasek, of Racine, Wisconsin, USA, scored a world record 3,208,870 points on the Stern ROM set on June 22, 1982. On the Konami ROM set, Todd Lamb reached 19,225,030 points in Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA, on October 1, 1983.\n\n"}

The term \"acute mental confusion\" is often used interchangeably with delirium in the \"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\" and the \"Medical Subject Headings\" publications to describe the pathology. These refer to the loss of orientation, or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking) and memory loss (the inability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material). The term is from , from : \"to pour together\", \"to mingle together\", \"to confuse\".\n\nConfusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction. Acute confusion is often called delirium (or \"acute confusional state\"), although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion. These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness, and temporal or spatial dis-orientation. Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as dementia, as well.\n\n\nThe most common causes of drug induced acute confusion are dopaminergic drugs (used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease), diuretics, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. The elderly, and especially those with pre-existing dementia, are most at risk for drug induced acute confusional states. New research is finding a link between vitamin D deficiency and cognitive impairment (which includes \"foggy brain\").\n\n\n"}

The district is bounded by seven other districts (from north clockwise): Ratchathewi (across the Khlong Saen Saep canal), Watthana, Khlong Toei, Sathon, Bang Rak, Pom Prap Sattru Phai (across the Khlong Phadung Krung Kasem canal), and Dusit.\n\nThe district was established in 1914. It is named after a Buddhist temple Wat Pathum Wanaram (literally means 'lotus forest temple') and the nearby Sa Pathum Palace (means 'lotus pond palace'). Both were built on the order of King Mongkut (Rama IV) and given their names due to an abundance of lotus in Khlong Saen Saep during his reign.\n\nThe district is divided into four sub-districts (\"khwaeng\").\nPathum Wan is best known for its shopping centers. Siam Center is the oldest one in the area. Opened in 1973, it is now flanked by Siam Discovery Center and Siam Paragon (opened December 2005).\n\nOne of the most crowded and popular to local people and tourists is MBK Center (also known as \"mah boon krong\"). A covered, air-conditioned pedestrian bridge over Phaya Thai Road connects to a congested sister shopping center, the Bonanza Mall, which mostly sells inexpensive clothing and fashion accessories.\n\nSiam Square, unlike others, is a shopping area that consists of a block of buildings and lots of small roads full of shops. There are two cinemas in Siam Square, built in the 1970s and run by the Apex chain: the Scala theater, a stand-alone movie theater, offers a single, big screen; the Lido is a small multi-plex with three screens (now is no longer in service). Another single big screen theater built in the same era, Siam, was destroyed during the 2010 Thai riots. Besides shops, many exam preparation schools are found in Siam Square.\n\nThe Ratchaprasong intersection is flanked by CentralWorld (formerly World Trade Center and then Central World Plaza), BigC Ratchadamri, Narayana Phan, Gaysorn and Central Chit Lom shopping malls.\n\nA large portion of Pathum Wan is occupied by organizations. Near MBK, Chulalongkorn University is the oldest university in Thailand. The main auditorium together with Faculty of Arts buildings, Maha Chulalongkorn and Maha Vajiravudh, are well known for their design. The Museum of Imaging Technology in the Faculty of Science houses a large collection of cameras from old to new. Next to the university are Chulalongkorn Hospital and the Thai Red Cross. Inside the Red Cross there is a snake farm called Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (or \"Sathan Saovabha\" in Thai) showing venom extraction and producing serum to treat snakebites.\n\nOne of the major tourist attractions is the Jim Thompson House. It is a complex of Thai wooden houses formerly home to James H.W. Thompson, an American who lived in Thailand, developed Thai silk industry, and brought it to fame to the Western world. It is now a museum filled with antique decor.\n\nThe Erawan Shrine at the Ratchaprasong intersection is a sacred place where people come to pray and make wishes to Brahma. Flowers, wooden elephants, or traditional Thai dances are returned when a wish is granted. The Trimurti shrine and Ganesha shrine at CentralWorld are popular places to pray as well.\n\nAlso in Pathum Wan are the Royal Bangkok Sports Club (a horse racing track operating every other Saturday), the National Stadium, and Lumphini Park, the first park in Bangkok. The Lumphini Boxing Stadium where traditional Thai boxing matches are held has been moved to a new site on Ram Intra Road in Bang Khen District.\n\nEvery year around Christmas and New Year, shopping centers, hotels and sidewalks in the Ratchaprasong shopping district are decorated with lights. It was started by Peninsular Plaza and the Regent Hotel, and later expanded to Sogo (now out of business), Amarin Plaza, CentralWorld, Central Chit Lom, Gaysorn and more. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) provides lights along the BTS Skytrain pillars.\n\n\n\nOther BTS stations in Pathum Wan are National Stadium and Ratchadamri on the Si Lom Line and Chit Lom and Phloen Chit on the Sukhumvit Line.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2079379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079379", "title": "Mitchell Gant", "text": "Mitchell Gant\n\nMitchell Gant is a fictional character in a series of books written by Craig Thomas. His first (and best known thanks to a successful film adaptation) appearance occurs in the 1977 novel \"Firefox\" as a US Air Force major that steals a Russian MiG-31 Firefox fighter aircraft prototype. The prototype uses experimental interfaces between pilot and plane to allow for \"thought-activated\" flying and combat solutions. Gant, however, has to think in Russian to enable the technology to work.\n\nGant grew up in Clarksville, a small town in rural America and found himself drawn to flight when as a child after seeing a small airplane land at a local gas station in need of fuel. With few happy memories of Clarksville, Gant found his way into the United States Air Force, becoming a fighter pilot. \n\nWhile flying combat during the Vietnam War, Gant's F-4 Phantom II was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Gant ejected and was immediately captured, apparently by guerrillas. The arrival of allied aircraft saves Gant, but also traumatizes him - napalm dropped by one of the aircraft incinerates a young girl travelling with the enemy soldiers. The experience left him with post-traumatic stress disorder, causing him to have frequent flashbacks. He suffers from a recurring nightmare about himself being a Vietnamese and burning in napalm dropped by US aircraft.\n\nAfter the war, he leaves the military and is recruited by the CIA and works for some time in a menial job in a Los Angeles pizza restaurant while shadowing a KGB cell. Later, he becomes a handyman, a drunk and a hobo. Eventually he is re-recruited by the CIA for their Firefox operation, supposedly because of his knowledge of Russian, his combat experience in Vietnam and his knowledge of flying Russian aircraft; he is already fluent in Russian (his mother was Russian) therefore only requires 3 months of training, learning to fly a replica MiG-25 as well as a simulator of the Firefox.\n\nIn \"Firefox\", an Anglo-American intelligence scheme inserts Gant into the Soviet Union in order for him to steal one of the two prototypes of a revolutionary fighter plane, the MiG-31, NATO code name \"Firefox\" (not to be confused with the real MiG-31, a development of the MiG-25). After crossing the Soviet Union from Moscow to the airbase where the Firefox is being developed, with the help of various MI6 agents and several false identities; dissident scientists involved in the project create a diversion allowing Gant to steal the plane. He then deals with several obstacles and, after dispatching the second prototype in a dogfight, has apparently succeeded in his theft.\n\nIn \"Firefox Down\", the immediate sequel to \"Firefox\", Gant realizes that he has not survived his dogfight with the second MiG-31 unscathed. Leaking fuel from a punctured fuel tank, and forced to burn more when confronted by two MiG-25's, Gant is forced to land the MiG-31 on a lake in Finland very close to the Soviet border. The Soviets capture Gant, but not before the plane sinks into the frozen Finnish lake. The Soviets use brainwashing to determine whether the MiG-31 crashed or landed. Gant escapes from the KGB and with the help of a Russian double agent named Anna Akhmerovna, the Soviet Union as well. Gant and Anna are reluctantly assisted by Dmitri Priabin, a KGB officer who is also Anna's lover. Anna is shot as Gant crosses the border. Gant meets up with a team of western intelligence experts that have recovered the MiG-31 from under the Finnish ice, but have not been able to move it to safety. Gant successfully flies the plane home, even though immersion under water has damaged the plane's radar-invisibility.\n\nGant's next role was in the novel \"Winter Hawk\". Originally, Gant's mission was to smuggle scientist and spy Filip Kedrov out of the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, as Kedrov had information on a Soviet spaceborne directed-energy weapon. However, Gant and Kedrov were both captured by the KGB. Dmitri Priabin, the ranking head of the KGB, still holds a vendetta against Gant due to the death of Anna Akhmerovna. When he learns, however, of a plot by the Soviet military to take control of the Soviet space weapon and use it against an American Space Shuttle, Priabin is again forced to ally himself with Gant in order to warn his civilian superiors in Moscow. With the Soviet Army imposing a security crackdown on Baikonur, even upon the KGB, Gant and Priabin escape Baikonur in a KGB helicopter. Shot down by Soviet helicopters, Gant is forced to escape again with evidence of the Soviet weapon - first on foot, then in a stolen An-2 cropduster, then again on foot when the An-2 is shot down near the Turkish border. Eluding a manhunt by Soviet Paratroopers, Gant is extracted by US Army helicopters.\n\nGant's final appearance comes in the novel \"A Different War\", in which he is a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. In this novel, he investigates the crashes of two examples of a fictional airliner, and discovers that they were both sabotaged by a former CIA agent working for a rival aircraft manufacturer. In the epilogue, it is mentioned that Gant was awarded a Medal of Honor following the events of the novel. It is also revealed that he was an F-117 Nighthawk pilot and instructor during the Persian Gulf War.\n"}

The club's manager is Vesa Vasara and it plays its home matches at \"Tapiolan urheilupuisto\". It was founded in 1957 as Tapion Honka, and changed its name to FC Honka in 1975.\n\nFC Honka is largely renowned in Finland for its extensive youth scheme with over 1000 youth players playing in various age groups. It also has women's football team in the Naisten Liiga.\n\nUntil 2005 FC Honka was thought of as a \"nearly, but not quite\" team, always underachieving in the Finnish First Division (Ykkönen). In the late 1990s the objective was promotion but year after year they failed. In the beginning of the 21st century FC Honka almost went bankrupt but was saved at the last moment.\nIn early 2005 the club was taken over by Jouko Pakarinen and Jouko Harjunpää, who had a plan to turn FC Honka from underachievers to a UEFA Champions League candidate.\n\nIn the first year of their take-over of FC Honka, the management succeeded in assembling a squad which won the First Division (Ykkönen) with ease and also made the semi-finals of the Finnish Cup where they eventually lost 1–0 to FC Haka.\n\nFC Honka was able to fight for top positions instantly, but narrowly missed the top three in their first two seasons. However, in 2007 team lost the Finnish Cup final to Tampere United on penalties. As Tampere United also won the league title, FC Honka qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. In 2008, FC Honka achieved its first medal by finishing 2nd in the league.\n\nFC Honka won the Finnish Cup in 2012. Due to financial difficulties the team was relegated to the third tier Kakkonen in 2015. In 2015 the fitness center company Esport bought the club and after that, the club has also been known as Esport Honka. The club dominated their first season in Kakkonen in 2015 and lost only two games, but were defeated in the promotion battle. After the 2016 season, the team was promoted to the second tier Finnish First Division (Ykkönen). After the 2017 Ykkönen season Honka was promoted to the highest Finnish tier Veikkausliiga after Promotion playoffs against HIFK.\n\nIn Veikkausliiga the team is also known as Esport Honka, the other teams only use the name FC Honka.\n\nVeikkausliiga\n\nYkkönen\n\nFinnish Cup\n\nFinnish League Cup\n\nLa Manga Cup\n\nAs runners-up in yh 2007 Finnish Cup to Tampere United, who had also won the league title, FC Honka qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, beating Icelandic ÍA 4–2 in the 1st qualifying round and Norwegian Viking in the 2nd. In the first round of actual competition, they were drawn against Racing Santander and lost 0–2 on aggregate.\n\nNext year, Honka qualified for the new UEFA Europa League, starting from the second qualifying round. The club beat Welsh Bangor City F.C. 3–0 on aggregate but lost 1–3 to FK Karabakh from Azerbaijan in the third qualifying round.\n\nFor the 2010–11 season, FC Honka was again drawn against Bangor City in the second round but lost 3–2 on aggregate.\n\nDuring the winter of 2009, Honka won the annual La Manga Cup, beating Nordsjaelland in the final.\n\nThis is the UEFA Club Ranking , including season 2013–14.\n\n\"Last update: 24 June 2014\"\n\n\"As of 6 February 2020.\"\n\nFC Honka Akatemia is the reserve team of FC Honka.

It is a university-preparatory school for boys in grades 5 to 12, with a focus on academic achievement, athletics, and leadership development. It is accredited by the Canadian Educational Standards Institute and is affiliated with other associations, including CAIS, CASE, NAIS and the International Boys' Schools Coalition (IBSC). St. Andrew's College's Arms were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on August 15, 2006.\n\nSt. Andrew's College was first situated at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Roxborough Avenue in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale, in a house named Chestnut Park that was previously owned by Sir David Macpherson. In 1905, the School moved to within Rosedale in an area west of MacLennan Avenue from Summerhill Avenue to Douglas Drive just north of Rosedale Field into a large Collegiate Gothic structure. The institution made its final move in 1926 to Aurora, where the current campus takes up campus in a suburban environment. Its Georgian architecture is built around the traditional quadrangle form. There are four boarding houses on campus, which is home to approximately half of the 651 boys. Many teaching faculty also live on campus. \n\nThe School's mission statement is \"Dedicating ourselves to the development of the complete man, the well-rounded citizen\". Sports are a compulsory activity and considered an essential part of school life and culture; 72 teams across 22 sports are offered by the School. As of 2002, every classroom and common area at St. Andrew's College is covered by a wireless network.\n\nThe students have a broad selection of courses to choose from, including Advanced Placement (AP) classes to better prepare them for post-secondary studies. As well, many AP examinations are offered at this testing location. Example of AP courses offered are chemistry, English, calculus, statistics, economics and computer science. SAC has a 100% university acceptance rate and graduates move on to post-secondary education around the world, including Canadian, American and British universities.\n\nMore than half the students from over 29 countries attending \"St. Andrew's College\" live in residence. Day boys, from York Region and the surrounding area, are a part of the four \"day\" houses: Ramsey, Laidlaw, Smith or Perrier. Middle School consists of students in grades 5 through 8 while Upper School comprises students in grades 9 through 12. Macdonald House is the home to all boarders attending grades 5 through 8. Upper School residents live in the four boarding houses: Flavelle, Sifton, Memorial, and Macdonald. The programs for Middle School students are generally independent of those for Upper School. The Middle School clans are Douglas, Montrose, Wallace, and Bruce. Each student is also part of a clan, where they participate in various activities to earn Clan Points.\n\nIn addition, St. Andrew's students hail from an array of different backgrounds. Half of the School's student body are boarders and nearly 50% of the boarding community is international, coming from such countries and regions as the Korea, Bahamas, Mexico, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, Bermuda, China, Nepal and the United States to name a few. The remaining students are from various provinces across Canada.\n\nCoulter Hall - A three-floor building designated for use by the Social Sciences and English departments. The basement floor is the lockers for Smith and Laidlaw houses and also houses the History and Cadet departments and the first floor is home to social science courses while the second is home to the history and business departments.\n\nKetchum Auditorium - The School's auditorium, adjacent to Coulter Hall. The Ketchum Auditorium is home to St. Andrew's annual school plays and drama department. It is named after the third headmaster Kenneth G. B. Ketchum LLD.\n\nMcLaughlin Hall - A three-storey wing connecting the Bedard Athletic Centre, Coulter Hall, and Rogers Hall. It is completely devoted to science-related studies.

Dunlap Hall is separated into two floors: the first serves numerous functions including the Headmaster's office, admission office and the School's administration office. The second floor houses the alumni and advancement office and the university guidance office.\n\nStaunton Gallery - The main part of the School where most of the students congregate, was dedicated to departing Headmaster Ted Staunton. The commons area is adjacent to the Wirth Art Gallery.\n\nCole Hall - The dining hall where breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served daily. It is also the site for many formal meals and ceremonies, like the annual St. Andrew's Day lunch & dinner in November. The music rooms are also located in the basement of the Great Hall.\n\nHigh Ropes Course - The high ropes course is the School's only rope course and is frequently used to train the School's cadets, especially those in grade 12 who wish to become cadet instructors, where completing the high ropes course is mandatory.\n\nMemorial Chapel - The School's main Chapel, which is dedicated to the Andreans who fought and died during World War I and II. The donation was made by Sir Joseph Flavelle, who also donated funds to establish Flavelle House. Morning services as well as some special services like the Remembrance Day Service are held in the Memorial Chapel.\n\nQuad - Located directly in front of the boarding houses, the quad is supposed to represent the sacred ground at St. Andrew's, and is used to host Prize Day in June and the annual Cadet inspection in May. However, students are allowed to use the quad for athletic purposes at designated times during the day.\n\nYuill Family Gymnasium - The main athletic facility for all Middle School students. Yuill Gym may also be used for Upper School activities, such as the annual Homecoming dance or some assemblies. Moreover, the Yuill gym is home to the Middle School rockclimbing facility. It was named for Old Boy Bill Yuill '57.\n\nYuill Family Athletic Complex - The upper fields of the School. Consists of a state of the art synthetic turf field, with an 800-seat stadium, press box, and scoreboard. Surrounding the field is a 6-lane regulation track. The complex also includes a regulation-size baseball diamond, batting cages, warm-up mounds, and multipurpose athletic courts. The complex was completed in Spring of 2012 and is named for its lead donor, Old Boy Bill Yuill '57.\n\nLa Brier Family Arena - A new hockey arena. It is being used for U12, U14, U16, JV and Varsity teams. Built and completed in 2014, it is the cornerstone in our athletic program and is named for its lead donor, the La Brier Family. \n\nRogers Hall - Built in 2003, this is the main building for the Middle School and is named after lead donor Dem Rogers '59.\n\nThe Center for Leadership, Innovation, and Performance (CLIP) - A fairly new addition to the campus (2015), which is home to the Business, Robotics, and Music classrooms, The Band room, where the Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band, and Pep Band practice and play, and the Wirth Theatre, where all of the school plays are held. The CLIP provides a connection from the Staunton Gallery to the Cole Dining Hall.\n\nIn addition to the School's academic and athletic facilities, there are four residential facilities for the boarding students at St. Andrew's. They are:\n\nSt. Andrew’s is also home to Canada’s second largest Royal Canadian Army Cadets Corps. Established in 1905, the #142 St. Andrew's College Highland Cadet Corps is now a credit earning, multi-year leadership program, but still culminates in an annual inspection in May. The School's cadet corps is also affiliated with the 48th Highlanders of Canada, retaining the same motto (\"Dileas Gu Brath\" - \"Faithful Forever\") as well as uniform (scarlet tunic and Modern Gordon tartan). In 2005, the centennial year, the Corps was granted the Freedom of the City of Aurora.\n\nThe Pipes and Drums Band is an integral part of the St. Andrew's College Highland Cadet Corps and one of its best-known elements. The primary responsibility of the Pipes and Drums Band is to provide music for the Battalion when it is on the march. In this role, the Band will be front and centre at the Annual Church Parade, the Headmaster's Parade, and the Annual Inspection in May.\n\nThe Cadet Corps closely resembles that of the Canadian army. Beginning from grade 8, all students at St. Andrew's must participate in the Cadet program. Those who wish to further pursue their leadership position in the Cadet Corps can either become platoon instructors or apply for senior positions within the corps. There are four mandatory levels in the cadet program, which accompanies each grade, and they are as follows:\n\nAs well, the St. Andrew's College Cadet Corps has won a multitude of awards. It won the Strathcona Cup for general efficiency of private school cadet corps in\n1944, 1945, 1947, 1954, 1955, 1961, 1964, 1967, 1973, 1980, 1981 and 1983. Moreover, it won the Earl Grey Challenge Trophy for the Best Cadet Corps in Canada in 1960-1961.\n\nSimilar to the Canadian Forces, a Cadet can be promoted on merit gained through Cadet accreditation and leadership within the corps. The rank structure is equivalent to that of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets; the Cadet Corps is one of only a few Cadet Corps in Canada which still keeps Cadets officers ranks.\n\nIn addition to the normal Cadet Corps, the Pipes and Drums Band are also paramount to the School's Cadet Corps. Internationally renowned as \"North America's piping heartland\" for its Piping and Drumming program, St. Andrew's College attracts hundreds of potential pipers each year to its summer \"Ontario School of Piping and Drumming at St. Andrew’s College\" camp.\n\nLike the Cadets in the Royal Canadian Army Cadets program, pipers and drummers can elevate their rank in the same way that the normal school Cadets do.\n\nEach year, St. Andrew's hosts' certain events that are special only to the School. Some of these activities and events involve the School's entire student body, while others invite alumni and their friends and families. These events serve different purposes, some of which are integral to the School's identity while others are used for fundraising causes.\n\n\nMiddle School Clans:\n\nStudents in a particular Upper School house, both day and boarding, are in the same clan.\n\nUpper School Clans:\n\nSt. Andrew's College is one of the original members of Ontario’s “Little Big Four” (the others being Ridley College, Trinity College School, and Upper Canada College). The photographs of each year’s representative teams line the walls along the first and second floors of the Bedard Athletic Centre. Sports are mandatory — all Upper School boys must participate in two out of three sports terms during the year, while Middle School students must participate in all three terms.\n\nSt. Andrew's has a tradition of sporting, as shown by its participation in both private and public school leagues and associations:\n\nSt. Andrew's College has teams for the following sports:\n\n\n\nSt. Andrew's notable alumni, known colloquially at the school as 'Old Boys', include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2079390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079390", "title": "Inchkeith", "text": "Inchkeith\n\nInchkeith (from the ) is an island in the Firth of Forth, Scotland, administratively part of the Fife council area.\n\nInchkeith has had a colourful history as a result of its proximity to Edinburgh and strategic location for use as home for Inchkeith Lighthouse and for military purposes defending the Firth of Forth from attack from shipping, and more recently protecting the upstream Forth Bridge and Rosyth Dockyard. Inchkeith has, by some accounts, been inhabited (intermittently) for almost 1,800 years.\n\nAlthough most of the island is of volcanic origin, the island's geology is surprisingly varied. As well as the igneous rock, there are also some sections of sandstone, shale, coal and limestone. The shale contains a great number of fossils. There are several springs on the island.\n\nThe island has the lowest average rainfall in Scotland at annually.\n\nThe island has an abundance of springs, as noted by James Grant. James Boswell noted two wells on the island during his visit, and speculated as to the former existence of a third within the Castle.\n\nThe name \"Inchkeith\" may derive from the medieval Scottish Gaelic \"Innse Coit\", meaning \"wooded island\". The latter element \"coit\", in Old Welsh \"coet\", is from the Proto-Celtic \"*cēto-\", \"wood\". The late 9th century \"Sanas Cormaic\", authored by Cormac mac Cuilennáin, suggests that the word had disappeared from the Gaelic of Ireland by that period, becoming \"coill\"; he states \"\"coit\" coill isin chombric\", that is, \"\"coit\" is Welsh for wood\", and explains that the Irish place-name \"Sailchoit\" is partly derived from Welsh. Although Scottish Gaelic was closer to Brythonic than Irish was, the \"Life of St Serf\" (written before 1180) calls the island \"Insula Keð\", suggesting the possibility that the specific element in Inchkeith was not comprehensible to that hagiography's anonymous author or translator; if we could be sure that the author was Scottish, rather than an English or French incomer, this could be taken to mean that the word was probably not comprehensible even in Fife Gaelic in the 12th century. Since Gaelic had all but disappeared as a language spoken natively in southern Fife by the mid-14th century, there is no continuous Gaelic tradition for the name, but the modern form is \"Innis Cheith\".\n\nSuch a rocky and exposed island can however never have supported many trees so it would be reasonable that the derivation may be otherwise. Early associations between Saint Adomnán and the island may indicate that the second element is derived from the name of his contemporary and associate Coeddi (or Céti), bishop of Iona.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about the early history of Inchkeith, and there is no certain reference to the island until the 12th century. In the days when people were compelled to cross the Firth of Forth by boat as opposed to bridge, the island was a great deal less isolated, and on the ferry routes between Leith/Lothian and Fife. Like nearby Inchcolm and the Isle of May, Inchkeith was attacked repeatedly by English raiders in the 14th century. This was the period when the Scottish Wars of Independence were in full swing, and decisive battles were being fought in the Lothians and in the Stirling/Bannockburn region, and so the island was effectively in the route of any supply or raiding vessels.\n\nIt is unknown who owned Inchkeith from the 8th century onward, but it is known that it was the property of the Crown until granted to Lord Glamis, an ancestor of the Queen Mother Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.\n\nIn 1497, the island was (along with Inchgarvie, a few miles away) used as an isolated refuge for victims of 'grandgore' (also spelled 'glandgore'), an old Scots name for 'syphilis', in Edinburgh. The 'grandgor' was recognised in the 1497 Minutes of the Town Council of Edinborough (Phil. Trans. XLII. 421) \"This contagious sickness callit the Grandgor.\". The Grandgore Act was passed in September 1497, causing Inchkeith, as well as other islands in the Firth, such as Inchgarvie, to be made a place of \"Compulsory Retirement\" for people suffering from this disease. They were told to board a ship at Leith and once there, \"to remain till God provide for their health\". It is probable that they all died.\n\nIn 1589, history repeated itself and the island was used to quarantine the passengers of a plague-ridden ship. More plague sufferers came here from the mainland in 1609. In 1799, Russian sailors who died of an infectious disease were buried here.\n\nDuring the reign of James IV of Scotland, Inchkeith was the site of a language deprivation experiment. The author of a chronicle Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie told how in 1493 James IV directed that a mute woman and two infants be transported to the island, in order to ascertain which language the infants would grow up to speak isolated from the rest of the world. This speech, in contemporary theory, would be the \"original\" language, or the \"language of God\". Pitscottie's version of the story, written in Scots language and given here in modern spelling beneath, was;\"And also the king gart tak ane dum woman and pat hir in Inchekeytht and gaif hir tua young bairnes in companie witht hir, and gart furnische them of all necessar thingis pertening to thair nourischment that is to say, meit, drink, fyre and candell, claithis, with all uther kynd of necessaris quhilk (is) requyrit to man or woman, desyrand the effect heirof to come to knaw quhat langage (or, \"leid\") thir bairnes wald speik quhene they cam to lauchfull aige. Some sayis they spak goode Hebrew; bot as to myself I knaw not bot be the authoris reherse\"<br><br>In modern English: \"The king ordered a mute woman to be put on Inchkeith and gave her two young children in company with her, and provided them with everything they would need for their nourishment, food, drink, fire and candle, clothes, and all other kinds of necessities needed by man or woman. He was desirous to discover what language the children would speak when they came of proper age. Some say they spoke good Hebrew, but I myself know no more than my sources say.\n\nIn the 16th century, the island suffered further English depredation during the war of the Rough Wooing. The General Duke of Somerset garrisoned the island in 1547 after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. His force of marines was ordered to reinforce the island, so they built a large square fort, with corner towers, on the site of the present day lighthouse. A French soldier, Jean de Beaugué, described how the building works were visible from Leith in June 1548. De Beaugué wrote that four companies of English soldiers and a company of Italians were ordered to help the English workmen, who were \"pioneers\" not soldiers.\n\nThe English admiral Edward Fiennes de Clinton anchored his fleet at Inchkeith in August 1548. His task was to prevent sea traffic in the Forth and the security of the English at the siege of Haddington. Clinton reported destroying 38 ships on 9 August 1548. French galleys lay off Burntisland. His duty in the Forth prevented him coming to aid John Luttrell at Broughty Castle\n\nThe garrison was ejected by a combined Franco-Scottish force under General D’Essé (André de Montalembert, Sieur de Essé) on 19 or 29 June 1549. Jean de Beaugué describes Monsieur de le Chapelle's injury while leading his German troops against the Italians and English who made a stand on the summit of the hill. On the following day, Mary of Guise, the regent, visited the island, to see the \"three and four hundred of her dead foes still unburied\". Since 29 June was Fête Dieu in France, she renamed the island \"L’Île de Dieu\". The soldiers also nicknamed it \"L’Île des Chevaux\" (The island of horses). Neither name stuck. Seven English banners captured on the island were sent to Henri II of France. On 17 July 1549, he gave the soldiers who brought the banners lifetime pensions. On 22 June Regent Arran's Privy Council ordered that all the towns and burghs on both sides of the Forth should contribute a workforce of 400 men to strengthen the fortifications, and pay their wages of two shillings for 16 days.\n\nAfter the end of the war of the Rough Wooing, the island was occupied by the French, under Mary of Guise, during her period as the Regent of Scotland between 1554 and 1560. The old English fortifications were further strengthened by the Scots and French, who under D’Essé built a larger and stronger fort. The works were directed by the Italian architect and military engineer Lorenzo Pomarelli. Accounts for this rebuilding written in French survive with the names of the Scottish craftsmen and women who worked there in 1555. The French-born gunner and carpenter Andrew Mansioun supervised a team of twenty three horses on the island.\n\nDuring the siege of Leith, the English admiral William Wynter obtained a description of the fortress as it stood on 17 April 1560. The wall and rampart was 30 feet thick, being 14 feet of stone behind 16 feet of earth. There were 140 French soldiers with 70 women, boys and labourers. As Wynter was trying to blockade the island and cut off supplies, the garrison was eating oysters and periwinkles gathered at low water and fish caught with angling rods. After the peace of the Treaty of Edinburgh in September 1560, the English diplomat noted Thomas Randolph noted that Captain Lucinet and his French garrison remained on Inchkeith, but there were now more women than men, and Edinburgh wits called the island \"l'Isle des Femmes.\"\n\nIn the 1560s, Mary, Queen of Scots, inspected the French garrison here, and a stone from the original gateway with \"MR\" (i.e. Maria Regina) and the date still exists, built into a wall below the lighthouse. The guns were used during the rebellion against Mary called the Chaseabout Raid. Lord Darnley was sent to inspect the armaments in August 1565. The English ship, \"The Aide\" captained by Anthony Jenkinson arrived in the Forth on 25 September 1565, and was bombarded by the cannon on Inchkeith. Jenkynson had intended to blockade Leith to prevent Lord Seton bringing more munitions for Mary from France.\n\nThe fort itself was demolished, or ordered to be \"raisit\" (razed) in 1567, after Mary had been deposed. Her opponents were anti-French and did not take too kindly to a French garrison so near the capital. The Captain of the garrison, Robert Anstruther, was rewarded with all the ironwork timber and slates to be salvaged, and ownership of the island was given to John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis. The remaining buildings were later used as a prison.\n\nJames Grant lists subsequent owners of Inchkeith - in 1649, he says, the \"\"eccentric and sarcastic\"\" Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit, going on to be owned by the Buccleuch family, forming part of the property of the Barony of Royston, near Granton.\n\nDuring the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the island was again taken by the English, and fortified.\n\nIn the late 18th century, James Boswell's \"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson\" (published in 1785) mentions Inchkeith, upon which Boswell and Dr. Johnson alighted, noting that the now-uninhabited island had a profusion of \"luxuriant thistles and nettles\", a \"strongly built\" fort, and \"sixteen head of [grazing] black cattle\". The fort visited appears to have been built in 1564.\n\nUsually the cynic, Johnson admired the island and said, \"I’d have this island; I’d build a house... A rich man of an hospitable turn here, would have many visitors from Edinburgh.\"\n\nIn 1803, construction was begun of Inchkeith Lighthouse, designed and built by Thomas Smith and Robert Stevenson. The lighthouse, standing 67 metres high, was first operational by 1804, and is now listed as a building of architectural and historic significance.\n\nInchkeith, unlike some of the other islands, was not fortified in the Napoleonic Wars but, with Kinghorn, was the site of the first modern defences, manned from 1881 until 1956. In 1878, the Royal Engineers built batteries on the three corners of the island, designed as separate fortresses.\n\nConstruction upon the island's \"South Fort\" began in spring of 1878, being completed in 1880. Construction on the West and East forts began in summer of 1878, being completed in 1880 and 1881 respectively. These forts were armed with four 10\" rifled muzzle loader guns, with two in the South Fort and one each in the east and west. In 1891, the East and West guns were replaced with two 6\" BL (breech loading) disappearing guns. A 9.2\" Mk I gun, also on a disappearing mounting, was installed in 1893, in the southern part of the island.\n\nA controlled minefield was controlled from Inchkeith, and the 'test room' for the Submarine Miners was created in an artificial cave, closed off by a granite wall, on the north side of the island. This was later used as a Small Arms Ammunition store.\n\nIn 1899, Inchkeith had a Compressed Air Foghorn installed, providing two 3.5 second blasts every 90 seconds during fog. This would remain in place until replaced after the second world war.\n\nFrom the 1890s until the early 1905, the fort at Inchkeith underwent a sequence of gun improvements and replacements. In 1893-95 two 4.7\" MK1 quick-firing guns were installed. (These had been removed from Fort Paull on the north bank of the Humber (which was disarmed, being deemed to be too close to Hull)). In 1898 the two 10\" rifled muzzle loaders in the south fort were dismounted, to be replaced by two 6\" Mk VII guns. The two 4.7\" guns were replaced by 9.2\" BL Mk X guns. By 1905 the armament of the island comprised: 1 x 9.2\" Mk I gun on a disappearing mounting; 2 x 9.2\" Mk X guns on Central Pedestal mountings; 2 x 6-inch Mk VII guns at the north fort (replacing a single Mk VI 6\" on a disappearing mounting); 2 x 6\" Mk VII guns in the southern fort. 1906-7 all the 6\" guns were removed, leaving only three 9.2\" guns in place. By 1911 the shore was being covered in Barbed Wire and by the end of the First World War a series of pillboxes had been built on the beaches round the island. By the end of the First World War the island was armed with three 9.2\" Mk X guns and six 6\" Mk VII guns.\nDuring World War I, the Royal Navy battleship , at the time a part of the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet, ran aground at Inchkeith on 26 January 1915, suffering considerable bottom damage. She was refloated after 36 hours and was repaired and refitted at Devonport Dockyard.\n\nBetween the wars the fort and its guns were maintained. In 1937 several Lewis Guns were supplied, for anti-aircraft defence, and a pair of 12 Pdr QF guns, which were for drill and practice. In 1938, following the Munich Crisis, the island was further mobilised, and had more Nissen Huts installed, presumably for equipment and personnel. On 21 February 1940 a sand-filled dummy shell had to be fired across the bows of the Naval trawler 'Peter Carey', to stop it straying into a mined area; the shell ricocheted off the water and ended up bursting into a tenement flat at 118 Salamander Street in Leith. Fortunately no-one was injured.\n\nInchkeith was the HQ of the Outer Defences of the Firth of Forth in both wars, in conjunction with batteries at Kinghorn, on the north shore, and Leith on the southern. The defences were designed to protect Edinburgh and the naval anchorage from distant bombardment (the Rosyth Dockyard was out of range), and also to deal with ships attempting to force their way into the naval anchorage beyond the defences, and towards the Forth Rail Bridge and the Rosyth Dockyard). In both wars there were anti-boat and anti-submarine booms across the river at this point, and in the Second World War, there were Induction loops and controlled minefields controlled from Inchkeith.\n\nIn the Second World War new batteries were established further east at Elie and Dirleton but Inchkeith remained fully armed.\n\nIn May 1940, the island was issued with 40 \"Board of Trade, Rocket Flares, Red\", for alerting in the event that an invasion was attempted (or spotted).\n\nThe gun strength of the island in the Second World War was the same as at the end of the First World War: one \"Major Full Time Battery\" of two 6\" guns covering the North side of the island, two 6\" guns covering the South side and the water between the island and Leith, a further two 6\" guns in the West Fort, and three 9.2\" guns, the purpose of which to tackle any enemy warships standing off to bombard the naval anchorage or the city of Edinburgh. The island was armed for a time with 3\" anti-aircraft guns to deal with German aeroplanes dropping magnetic mines. These were replaced by Bren and Bofors guns. The garrison of the island was over 1100 at its peak in the Second World War, with dozens of buildings, emplacements, fire control centres, and Nissen huts, many of which remain in varying states of repair.\n\nOperations Fortitude North and Fortitude South were related to a wider deception plan called Operation Bodyguard. Operation Bodyguard was the overall Allied strategic deception plan in Europe for 1944, carried out as part of the build-up to the Invasion of Normandy. The major objective of this plan was to lead the Germans to believe that the invasion of northwestern Europe would come later than was actually planned, and to threaten attacks at other locations than the true objective, including the Pas de Calais, the Balkans, southern France, Norway, and Soviet attacks in Bulgaria and northern Norway.\n\nOperation Fortitude North's fictional British Fourth Army were based in Edinburgh, and spoof radio traffic and Double agents were used as means to disseminate the misinformation. On 3 March 1944, members of a \"Special RS (Royal Signals) Unit\" from the British Fourth Army landed on Inchkeith, with a detachment of 22 men and 4 officers, with two radio vans. At the beginning of April, a further 40 men arrived, and proceeded to stage mock attacks of the Inchkeith defences via the cliffs, until their departure in September.\n\nThe aim of this ruse, unknown to the participants, was to make German High Command believe that a raid in Norway or elsewhere was being planned. Although Operation Fortitude was a great success, Inchkeith appears not to have been overflown by German Reconnaissance planes until 7 October. Examination of the footage taken in 1945 appeared to indicate that the plane flew too high to ascertain anything meaningful.\n\nPost-war, defences were dismantled commencing late 1945. By early January 1946, only a small number of troops with a \"nucleus\" of coastal guns remained, and finally in 1956/7, all military use of the island ceased, and ownership passed over to the Northern Lighthouse Board, who performed a variety of renovations on the island from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nThe island, like Cramond Island, was previously worked as a farm. It is now abandoned, and unkempt.\n\nIn 1958, an experimental foghorn was installed, replacing the previous 19th century system. A diaphone system providing 4 blasts of 1.5 seconds once every minute was installed on Inchcolm, operated by radio telephone from Inchkeith. This was replaced with an electrically operated system controlled by an automatic fog detector in 1986.\n\nIn 1971 the lighthouse and associated buildings became Category B listed buildings, and in 1976 the island and its fortifications became a scheduled monument.\n\nIn 1986 the lighthouse was automated, allowing it to be remotely managed by a telephone connection. The Northern Lighthouse Board removed the permanent lightkeepers, and sold the island to businessman Tom Farmer (founder of Kwik-Fit). Under Farmer's ownership, permission is needed to land at Inchkeith; he himself lives in Barnton in Edinburgh. The current lighthouse is powered by nickel-cadmium batteries, \"charged on a time cycle of three times per week by one of two (12.5 KVA) markon alternators with TS3 Lister diesel engines.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a teenager she worked at a chemical plant. From 1934 to 1937 she studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute.\n\nThe main themes of her early poetry were the heroism of the Soviet people during industrialization (\"Year of birth\", 1938; \"Railroad\", 1939; \"Stones and grass\", 1940) and during World War II (\"Lyrics\", 1943). Her most famous poem is \"Zoya\" (1942), about Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a young girl killed by Nazis. This work was one of the most popular poems during the Soviet era. From 1940 to 1950, the poetry of Aliger was characterised by a mix of optimistic semi-official verses (\"Leninskie mountains\", 1953), and poems in which Aliger tried to analyse the situation in her country in a realistic way (\"Your Victory\", 1944 - 1945). In 1956, in a gathering of Khrushchev with the intelligentsia he admonished the writers for interfering with the political system. It is noted that Aliger was the only writer to speak up against him at the event. It was after his retirement that he apologized to her for his behavior. Aliger wrote numerous essays and articles about Russian literature and her impressions on travelling (\"On poetry and poets\", 1980; \"The return from Chile\", 1966).\n\nHer first husband was the composer Konstantin Makarov-Rakitin, who was killed at the front near Yartsevo in 1941 after the death of their infant son (their daughter Tatyana [1940-1974] became a poet and translator), a double tragedy that left her devastated. The following year she had an affair with the author Alexander Fadeyev; from this union was born a daughter Maria, who married Hans Magnus Enzensberger and lived abroad for twenty years, killing herself shortly after a brief return to Russia in 1991.

The soundtrack features music by industrial metal group A Dark Halo, who performed two songs in the game including its theme song \"Burn It All.\"\n\n\"Day of Reckoning 2\" features improved graphics over its predecessor, a new strategy-based submission system, and a storyline that allows the player to choose paths. This game was the last wrestling and/or WWE video game to be released for the GameCube and the first WWE game to feature Stone Cold Steve Austin as a legend along with the PlayStation 2 game, \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006\".\n\n\"Day of Reckoning 2\" features similar gameplay to the previous \"Day of Reckoning\" game with returning features such as Momentum shift and momentum lift. New to the game is the stamina meter, which slows wrestlers' movement over time and when completely depleted, temporarily leaves characters winded and open to attack. In addition, different levels of bleeding on the player's character also affect the character's ability to regain stamina.\n\nThe game also introduces four types of submission options. While applying a submission hold, players can choose from one of four submission types: a Taunt submission depletes the opponent's momentum meter, a Rest Hold submission allows the player's character to regain stamina, the Drain submission drains the opponent of stamina, while a regular submission move causes damage to a particular body part.\n\nPlayers can again create wrestlers and customize each character's set of attacks. Each character can be assigned between one and nine finishing moves, one for each position an opponent is in. The game's Story Mode picks up from the story introduced in the first \"Day of Reckoning\", but created wrestlers cannot be imported from the first game.\n\nThe story continues from where the original \"Day of Reckoning\" left off, with the player's character at the top of the \"Raw\" roster. Almost a year after WrestleMania XX, Evolution has disbanded and the player's character has lost the World Heavyweight Championship back to Triple H and has fallen down the ranks of WWE.

In an attempt to increase the show's ratings, General Manager Eric Bischoff decides to host a mini-tournament for the World Heavyweight Championship and the finals will be held at WrestleMania 21. The player's character eventually defeats Chris Jericho and advances into the finals. Triple H and the player's character prepare for the finals match before Bischoff reports that the belt was stolen.\n\nThe player advances in the story by gathering information on the whereabouts of the World Title. Soon the player gets framed for stealing the belt, dumped by Stacy, fired and banned from \"Raw\". However, \"SmackDown!\" General Manager Theodore Long signs the player to a lifetime \"SmackDown!\" contract. Eventually the player wins the WWE Championship and later finds out that former allies Chris Jericho and Randy Orton along with Edge had stolen the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nWith the mystery solved, Triple H asks the player's wrestler for a title match at WrestleMania 21 in a Last Man Standing Match for the WWE Championship. The player's character wins the match, reunites with Stacy and reforges a friendship with Triple H, who turns face and takes possession of the newly found World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n"}

He was a delegate for Massachusetts in the Continental Congress.\n\nJonathan Jackson was born in 1743 in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay. He was the son of Edward Jackson (1708–1757) and Dorothy Quincy Jackson. He graduated from Harvard in 1761 and then moved to Newburyport to take up a mercantile career.\n\nJackson first served as an apprentice to another merchant, Patrick Tracy. By 1765 he had entered business on his own as a shipper and importer. He became prosperous and in 1772 he married his mentor's daughter, Hannah Tracy. Shortly after he went into a partnership with his wife's brothers, John and Nathaniel Tracy. The firm of Jackson, Tracy, & Tracy failed during the revolution. So, after 1782, Jonathan took a series of salaried jobs.\n\nIn 1780 Jackson joined John Hancock and other community leaders in the founding of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nDespite his dependence on foreign trade, Jackson became a supporter of the American Revolution. He converted some of his merchant ships to privateers. In 1775 he was elected to the revolutionary Massachusetts Provincial Congress. He became a member of the state's \"Committee of Correspondence\" and headed the Essex County \"Committee of Safety\".\n\nJackson was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1777. He attended the state's Constitutional Convention in 1779. Then in 1782, Massachusetts sent him as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. But, by this time his financial reverses made him take a job, although he did serve one term in the Massachusetts State Senate in 1789.\n\nEventually Jackson was able to combine his need for employment with his desire for public service. In this period, elected positions generally had no pay. He served as the first U.S. Marshal for the district of Massachusetts (1789–1791), then as a federal Supervisor of Revenue from 1792 until 1801.\n\nJackson served as Treasurer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from 1802 to 1806, and as treasurer of Harvard University. He was president of the Boston Bank, which later became the First National Bank of Boston. When he died in Boston in 1810, he was buried in the \"Old Granary Burying Ground\" there.\n\nJonathan Jackson and Hannah Tracy had nine children. Their daughter, Hannah, married the manufacturer Francis Cabot Lowell, who went into business with their son, Patrick Tracy Jackson. Their son Charles Jackson went on to serve on the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Their son James Jackson became a physician and co-founded Massachusetts General Hospital, becoming its first physician.\n\nJonathan Jackson's great-grandsons included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. who served on the U.S. Supreme Court.

It is at its highest point.\n\nCraigleith makes up a chain of islands near North Berwick along with Bass Rock, Fidra and the Lamb. Of the four islands it is the closest to the town's harbour. Like the other nearby islands, Craigleith is a bird colony. Divers often explore the area around the island.\n\nCraigleith is a laccolith, a lava dome. The Lothians are dotted with evidence of ancient volcanic activity, such as the Bass Rock and Arthur's Seat. Craigleith is made up of essexite which is popular for making curling stones.\n\nHistorically, Craigleith was a rabbit warren, where the animals were deliberately bred for food. Rabbits were wiped out by myxomatosis in the 1950s. They were mysteriously re-introduced onto the island in 2008, and some have been seen recently.\n\nIn 1814, Sir Hew Dalrymple purchased the island from North Berwick Town Council.\n\nThe puffin colony on Craigleith, once one of the largest in Britain with 28,000 pairs, became endangered from 1999 onwards, due to an invasion of the non-endemic plant tree mallow, thriving with warmer winters, which choked the puffins' burrows, preventing them from rearing their chicks, or \"pufflings\". An ongoing project, SOS Puffin, led by the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick, was launched early in 2007 after one of the Centre's volunteers, Maggie Sheddan, noticed the ever-decreasing numbers of puffins. Since then, hundreds of volunteers have been working hard to rid the island of the problem, ferried out by boat from the Seabird Centre during the winter months, when the puffins are out at sea. Initial results show signs that the puffins are starting to return to the island to breed. Cormorants, shags and guillemots breed here.\n\nThe Scottish Seabird Centre has solar-powered cameras on the islands which transmit images of the puffins and other wildlife on the island via live webcams. Daily boat trips around the island have been made since 2008.\n\n\n"}

It can be used as an offensive or defensive weapon depending on the situation.\n\nA lob is usually hit when an opponent is standing near the net, waiting to volley. The ball should sail over the top of the opponent and into the open court behind him or her. A good offensive lob cannot be reached by the opponent, yet it is low enough and has enough pace so that the opponent can not run back and chase it down. It can win the point outright, although with some risks involved. Topspin greatly enhances the effectiveness of offensive lob but also makes the stroke more difficult. When executing the lob, players usually hit the ball at an angle between 0 degrees (flat) and 45 degrees (diagonal). Some players, such as Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Andy Murray and Lleyton Hewitt, have developed good offensive lobs.\n\nA defensive lob, on the other hand, simply intends to push the opponent back to the \"baseline\" and prolong the point. When a player is pulled out of court, a defensive lob is also useful to buy time to run back and get into a better defensive position.\n\nA lob that is not successful (can be reached by the opponent)(too shallow) is susceptible to being smashed.\n\nIn doubles, spin or slice is applied to the lob, so it will go over the head of a player at the net and bounce away from the baseline player.\n\nSome players are able to manipulate a lob so that it appears the shot is overhit, but dips enough to fall within the baseline, often deceiving the opponent. This is created by generating a great amount of backspin, slicing or cutting the ball over the head of the other player. This shot, which can also be hit with tremendous topspin, is called a \"moon volley or moon lob.\n\nThe lob was introduced by the second Wimbledon champion Frank Hadow in his defeat of Spencer Gore. For this reason Hadow was known as the \"loftiest champion\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2079447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079447", "title": "List of Singaporean LGBT documentaries", "text": "List of Singaporean LGBT documentaries\n\nThis article lists and documents Singaporean documentaries on LGBT issues in that country.\n\nLGBT rights and culture in the Republic of Singapore are a controversial topic, due to the country's history of homophobia. Over the years, Singapore has taken steps to open up to gender equality, however the issue of LGBT rights and culture in Singapore is a taboo subject for the Singaporean media.\n\nIt was only in May 2003 that the very first locally produced television documentary dealing with homosexuality as its main subject was broadcast on Singaporean airwaves. It was a homophobic, 30-minute episode in a Mandarin-language series called \"Crunch Time 2\" shown on Channel U, a television station owned by Singapore Press Holdings. The series was advertised in \"The Straits Times\" which promoted it as one that featured the turning points in the lives of 12 people including a loan shark, an unwed mother and a drug addict.\n\nThe particular program featured actors re-enacting the supposedly true-life account of a young, masculine gay Singaporean man cruising for sex in public swimming pools and toilets. It reinforced the misconception that homosexuality resulted from having an unhappy home, parents who constantly fight, and being sexually abused. In this case, the protagonist was only 6 years old when he was asked by an adult female to perform sexual acts with a girl his age. The episode wound up with an interview with a spokesman from Choices, a Christian counselling group from the Church of our Saviour (COOS) in Queenstown which helps \"straighten\" out gay lives, which was the eventual outcome for the gay man in the story. He was depicted as having been \"successfully'\" converted through counselling from a dissatisfied, unfulfilled homosexual to a man happily married to a female spouse and producing a son.\n\nThe negative and stereotypical depiction of homosexuality in the program prompted an online petition which garnered more than 200 signatories over the ensuing weekend. It probably had a significant effect as the episode was the last time a homophobic documentary was aired in Singapore. However, the overwhelmingly influential factor in ending televised homophobia was Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's statements in \"Time magazine\" in July 2003 about reversing anti-gay hiring policies in the Civil Service.\n\n\nIn a 180-degree turnaround just 2 months after the above documentary, which aimed to encourage homosexuals to turn straight, Channel U aired a groundbreaking episode in the info-tainment hands-on series \"OK, No Problem\" at 7:30 p.m. on 30 July 2003. This time, it sought instead to educate the public that one could not judge a man's sexual orientation merely from his external appearance and to foster understanding and acceptance of homosexuals. Popular compère Chuan Yi Fong was filmed in a hawker centre in Ang Mo Kio where she asked random diners about their opinions on homosexuality. A range of positive and negative views were offered.\n\nA live telephone interview with Dr. Tan Chong Kee, who was introduced as having written a thesis on homosexuality in Taiwan, was interpolated during a voting session by onlookers. The latter were asked to pick which, amongst 3 chosen men, they thought were gay, judging from externalities. After the votes were cast, it was revealed to the audience's surprise that none of the three were gay. In fact, one had brought along his wife and baby son.\n\nThe highlight of the episode was the appearance of an actual gay man named Anthony who was initially hidden behind a black curtain. After a suspenseful emergence to face a wall of curious onlookers, he spoke emotionally about his own struggles as a homosexual and how he hoped society would accept them. He also publicly thanked Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for his recent announcement that openly homosexual individuals would now be employed in the Civil Service. Anthony choked back his tears as he spoke, causing the compère's eyes to also redden, and members of the audience to listen sympathetically. For his courage, Anthony was presented with a bouquet of flowers and received a huge round of applause.\n\n\nLater, on the same night of 30 July 2003 at 8:30 p.m., the Malay-language channel Suria aired another documentary on homosexuality in its \"Detik\" (meaning \"a second in time\") series. The particular episode was entitled \"Haruskah golongan Homoseksual diterima?\" (Should Homosexuals be accepted?)\n\nIt featured interviews with a Malay gay man named Helmi and a Malay lesbian named Zac in which they recounted their self-discovery and personal relationships. People on the street were asked whether they could accept homosexuals and a diverse range of negative to positive opinions were expressed.\n\nIt revealed to the Malay community, the presence of websites providing support for Muslim homosexuals. Figures of authority queried for their views included Dr. Francis Ngui (President, Singapore Psychiatric Association) and Ustaz Fatris Bakaram (Assistant Mufti and Head of the Mufti Office, Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, MUIS or Singapore Islamic Religious Council).\n\nAll in all, the programme tried its best to present a balanced view of homosexuality without moralising or injecting any subliminal message.\n\n\nOn 23 February 2005, Mandarin-language Channel U broadcast its third programme dealing with homosexuality in the 'Inside Out' current affairs series. The topic of the episode was \"Do homosexuals have space for their activities?\"\n\nThis programme was a landmark in that it was the first time that the views of leading gay activists, in this case Eileena Lee and Charles Tan from People Like Us 3 (PLU3), were given a relatively lengthy airing on primetime television. Artistic Co-Director Nelson Chia from Toy Factory Theatre Ensemble, a drama company which had staged several plays with homosexual themes and assisted in producing the episode itself, also presented a pro-gay voice for theatre in particular and society in general. Chia expressed, with great conviction, his disquietude with the contradictions between Singapore's liberalisation drive and the recent curbing of public gay spaces, despite the fact that he himself was a heterosexual family man.\n\nAn anonymous gay man named \"David\" was also interviewed at length, in which he doubted Singaporeans' general level of acceptance of homosexuals.\n\nThe programme was thought to have been produced to give an opportunity for the gay community to vent its concerns after an official clampdown on gay parties like Nation.04 and Snowball in 2004, presumably as part of a conservative backlash against the rampant spread of HIV infection within the community.\n\nIn spite of NUS sociologist Associate Professor Paulin Tay Straughan's assertion in the documentary that homosexuals in Singapore enjoyed almost everything their straight counterparts were entitled to, gay community leaders like Alex Au begged to differ.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 15, 1998. In an extended parody of \"Lord of the Flies\", Bart, Lisa and other students from Springfield Elementary School are stranded on an island and are forced to work together. Meanwhile, Homer founds his own Internet company. It was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Pete Michels. Guest star James Earl Jones narrates the final scene of the episode.\n\nThe Springfield Elementary School Model United Nations club is going on a field trip. On the bus, Bart, Nelson, Ralph, and Milhouse play a game by racing fruit down the aisle. Milhouse rolls a grapefruit that gets stuck under the brakes. When Otto tries to press down on the pedal, it squirts juice into his eyes, causing him to lose control and drive the bus off a bridge.\n\nOtto tries to swim for help, but gets swept away by the current and picked up by Chinese fishermen. Otto is excited, thinking they will help him rescue the kids, but they actually plan to use him for slave labor below deck. The students swim to a nearby tropical island, where Bart tries to tell everyone that being stranded is fun and imagines a lavish lifestyle there. Reality sets in when the island is found to be largely barren and the kids lack survival skills. With no food or adult supervision, the kids rely on snack food retrieved from the sunken bus by Bart, while Lisa sets up a ration system. They awake the next morning to find the snacks all gone. Suspecting Milhouse, he blames the loss on a mysterious island \"\"monster\"\", which does not hold water with most of the kids. As they prepare to lynch him, Lisa reminds them of why they traveled in the first place - the Model UN - and Milhouse is allowed a trial, with Bart as judge.\n\nAs there is insufficient evidence to prove Milhouse ate all the food, Bart acquits him. Lisa proclaims the law has spoken, but it soon turns to outright mob rule as the other kids fail to accept the verdict and attempt to lynch Milhouse, as well as Bart and Lisa. They chase them into a cave, where all the kids are scared off by a monster for real. Martin then sees the \"monster\" is actually a wild boar. On one of the boar's tusks is an empty bag of chips, revealing that the boar was the culprit who ate all the snacks. Lisa says that if there is a live animal, there must be a food source somewhere, and recommends the slime it licks. The other kids instead kill the boar and eat it, while Lisa adheres to her strict vegetarianism by licking the rocks (all the while insulting the others by calling them \"savages\" but also struggling with her disgust on the slime). A deus ex machina narration by James Earl Jones says the kids learned to live in peace and were somehow rescued by Moe Szyslak.\n\nBack at home, Homer discovers that Ned Flanders has his own home-based Internet business and decides he wants to start his own company. However, Homer has not the foggiest idea of how an Internet business works nor what to peddle. He is later visited by Bill Gates and his goons, who offer to buy him out. Homer then learns that Gates' definition of \"buy out\" is to smash up Homer's office, with the snarky response \"I did not get rich by writing a lot of checks\".\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary for \"The Simpsons' \" ninth season, the couch gag was suggested by Dan Castellaneta's niece. To make the fishermen's speech as accurate as possible, Cohen called a friend who spoke Mandarin. When the Chinese actors came, the actors did not feel Mandarin was geographically appropriate, and was changed to Cantonese, which is spoken more in China's coastal regions and would be more appropriate for sailors and fishermen. A deleted scene was where Homer furnishes his home office with anti-stress toys, but becomes angry and stressful himself when he tries each of them due to their failure to work or their immediate breakage due to shoddy manufacturing. The producers said the decision to cut that scene was for timing purposes.\n\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Das Bus\" finished 17th in ratings for the week of February 9–15, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.9, equivalent to approximately 9.6 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\" and \"King of the Hill\".\n\nIn a 2006 article in \"USA Today\", \"Das Bus\" was highlighted among the six best episodes of \"The Simpsons\" season 9, along with \"Trash of the Titans\", \"The Last Temptation of Krust\", \"The Cartridge Family\", \"Dumbbell Indemnity\", and \"The Joy of Sect\". \n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a \"fantastic episode\", adding: \"Ignore the Internet business side, and wallow in the cleverness of the children trapped on the island. Bart has never been cleverer, Nelson more menacing, and Milhouse more geekish. Great stuff with a delightful ending that is so witty and obvious, that it's annoying you never imagined they'd get away with it.\"\n\nThe episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California, Berkeley, where it is used to \"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\", and to figure out what it is \"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies\". Some questions asked in the courses include: \"What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points? How is the satire conveyed: through language? Drawing? Music? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? What is the difference between satire and parody?\"\n\n"}

It is the largest park in the island city. Similar to the Azad Maidan and August Kranti Maidan (formerly Gowalia Tank Grounds), it is of historical and cultural value because of the political and social gatherings it has witnessed, both in pre- and post-independence Mumbai. The of open space is renowned as having been a cradle of the game of cricket in India. The park has a variety of sports facilities including cricket nets, tennis courts, a Mallakhamba area and a football pitch amongst others.\n\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation renamed the park from Shivaji Park to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Park on 12 March 2020.\n\nThe open ground or \"maidan\" is flanked around its edge by a \"katta\", a simple continuous low kerb edging that forms a makeshift seat - a popular hangout for the young and old alike. The paved walkway around this perimeter is crowded with joggers and people taking walks. The inner circumference of the park is . The \"maidan\" area covers , more than half of which is occupied by 31 tenants, the largest being clubs such as the Shivaji Park Gymkhana, and the Bengal Club. The remaining part of the ground and open spaces is available to the public for sports and other activities. Other structures dotting the periphery of the grounds include the Samarth Vyayam Mandir (a gymnasium), Shivaji Park Nagarik Sangh (established in 1947), a children's playground, a park for the elderly called \"Nana-Nani Park\", or Grandparents Park, the Scout's Pavilion, a Hindu temple dedicated to Ganesh, and a community library. The walkway is lined with large rain trees.\n\nThe most prominent entrance to the park is the one on the east side, intended only for pedestrians. A bust of Meenatai Thackeray, late wife of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, has been placed at this entrance. Previously a bust of Ram Ganesh Gadkari was present at the same spot. Bal Thackeray himself was cremated here.\n\nThe park was established in 1925 by the Bombay Municipal Corporation, during British Rule. It was known as the Mahim Park until 1927, when it was renamed after the 17th century king of the region, Shivaji, at the behest of a municipal councilor, Avantika Gohkale. The Shivaji Park Gymkhana, then known as the Dadar Hindu Gymkhana, opened its first Tennis court on the grounds in 1927 and inaugurated its pavilion in November 1931.\n\nBesides being a venue for gatherings of freedom fighters in British India, after independence in 1947, Shivaji Park was the focal point of the \"Samyukta Maharashtra Chalval\" (the struggle for a consolidated Maharashtra) that led to the present Indian state of Maharashtra being formed in 1960. During this period, the legendary writer, journalist, playwright, poet and social leader Acharya Prahlad Keshav Atre led this movement, addressing crowds of hundreds of thousands at this ground, earning him the title of the 'Lord of Shivaji Park'.\n\nShivaji Park has been integral to the political gatherings of the local political party Shiv Sena, and has witnessed numerous other political rallies. In May 2010, the Bombay High Court declared the ground a silence zone after local residents filed a public interest litigation suit in September 2009, complaining about the noise pollution in the area on account of political rallies and gatherings.\n\nThe statue of Shivaji, found on the western side of the park is one of the very few statues in which he is depicted without having drawn out his sword. Instead, Shivaji is shown simply leading the way with his arm outstretched. Sculpted in 1966 using donations from the local population, the statue is a rare example of the pacifist policies of the then state government of Maharashtra. It was considered a sensitive issue by the government to let this statue not depict the usual confrontational posture of Shivaji, who had fought many battles against the Mughal Empire.\n\nShivaji Park is renowned as the cradle of Indian cricket. It is home to eight cricket clubs, such as those of Anna Vaidya and Ramakant Acharekar, which produced several international cricket players for India.\n\nSome famous players who have trained here are Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Ajit Wadekar, Vijay Manjrekar, Eknath Solkar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Chandrakant Pandit, Lalchand Rajput, Sandeep Patil, Ajit Agarkar, Pravin Amre, Vinod Kambli and Sanjay Manjrekar.\n\nIt is a feeder park to Ramnarain Ruia College and Poddar College in nearby Matunga.\n\nThe area surrounding the park has many buildings dating back to the mid-1900s, and the Shivaji Park Residential Zone is some of the more sought-after real estate in Mumbai.

They play their home matches at Vuosaaren urheilukenttä, also called Heteniitty. The club's name and crest refer to Vikings, and they are known for their red colour.\n\nFC Viikingit played the 2007 season in the Finnish premier division (\"Veikkausliiga\"), but were relegated to the \"Ykkönen\" and competed there until 2014, when they were relegated to Kakkonen. The club's reserve team, FC Viikkarit, were promoted to the \"Kakkonen\" for the 2014 season but they had to give it up, because they were not able to play on the same division as the main team.\n\nThe club was first founded as \"Vuosaaren Viikingit\" ('Vuosaari Vikings') in 1965. The new club started at the very bottom of the Finnish football pyramid, spending their first years in the fifth and sixth divisions. For the 1973 season, they were promoted to the IV division and played there for the next ten seasons. In 1983, the team were promoted to the III division, but this visit was cut short, as they were relegated again the following season. They were promoted again for the 1993 season, and this time managed to stay up. They even made a year-long visit to the \"Kakkonen\" in 1996, but were relegated after finishing last in their group. In 1997, the footballing section of the club was split into its own organisation with the name FC Viikingit.\n\nWith the new organisation in place, the football club started to enjoy some success in the third division, and were promoted back to the Kakkonen for the 2001 season. The newly promoted team did well in the second division, finishing at first place in their group and winning direct promotion to the \"Ykkönen\" for the 2002 season. In their first season in the first division, FC Viikingit finished second to last and had to compete in a play-off against WJK from Varkaus. The Reds won the play-off and remained in the first division. For the 2003 season, Markku Kanerva was appointed the club's manager. He led the club to a successful season, finishing third in a 14-team league, only one point from a promotion play-off spot. In 2004, the club were managed by Steven Polack and finished fourth.\n\nJari Europaeus was appointed manager of the Reds in 2005. In the following season, he led the club to first place in the Ykkönen, winning promotion to the \"Veikkausliiga\", the highest level of Finnish football. In the first ever premier division match played at Heteniitty, Viikingit beat FC Honka with a 3–2 scoreline and an attendance of over 3,000. The aim for the 2007 Veikkausliiga season was to stay up in the top flight, and with the performances the team gave in the first half of the season, this looked likely. The attendance record, which is still in force, was created in the local derby against HJK Helsinki, which drew 4,255 viewers to Vuosaaren urheilukenttä. In the second half of the season, the team's performances began to drop. However, they managed to finish 13th and avoid direct relegation, but still had to compete in a relegation play-off against RoPS. The first leg in Rovaniemi finished 1–0 in favour of the home side, and therefore the Reds needed a win in the second leg, which was played at Töölön pallokenttä due to heavy snowfall at Heteniitty. However, the match finished 1–1, and Viikingit were relegated to the first division.\n\nAfter relegation from the top flight in the 2007 season, Viikingit have often reached the top three in the Ykkönen, but have fallen short of promotion every time. In 2008, the new manager Toni Korkeakunnas led the team to second place, but KuPS took the promotion play-off with an aggregate scoreline of 2–1. History repeated itself in 2010, when the Reds played JJK Jyväskylä in the play-off, but the Jyväskylä side were marginally better (3–2 on aggregate). From the 2011 season, Viikingit have been managed by long-time Reds player Ilkka Jäntti, finishing fifth and third respectively in the 2011 and 2012 seasons. The club's attendance record in the Ykkönen, 1,670 viewers, was created on 21 July 2011 against local rivals HIFK.\n\nIn 2013, the club were in danger of relegation to the Kakkonen, but played well in the closing stage of the season, finishing seventh in the end. This was the club's worst finish since 2002. The season's bright spot was the fact that the reserve team, FC Viikkarit, won their group in the Kolmonen and were promoted to the second division for the 2014 season.\n\nFC Viikingit play their home matches at Vuosaaren urheilukenttä, often called \"Heteniitty\" or \"Hettari\". The ground is located in Central Vuosaari in a former gravel pit, and for this reason is sometimes also called \"Monttu\" ('the Pit'). The ground currently has a capacity of 1,500, but has opportunities for expansion. For the 2007 Veikkausliiga season, the ground was expanded to 3,500 seats, but these expansions were removed after the club were relegated.\n\nThe reserve side FC Viikkarit play their home matches at Kartanon kenttä in Nordsjön kartano. This is likely to change for the 2014 season, however, as the ground currently does not fulfil the stadium requirements for the Kakkonen. The women's first team, as well as youth teams, also play at Kartanon kenttä.\n\n\n\n\nThe football club split into two separate organisations in the end of the 2008 season. The first team now operates under its own registered association, \"FC Viikingit edustus ry\", while all other teams continue under \"FC Viikingit ry\".\n\nThe reserve side FC Viikingit/2 was founded in 2007 and played its first seasons in the Kolmonen. In the 2013 season, the team won its group and achieved promotion to the Kakkonen. Upon reaching promotion, the team was renamed FC Viikkarit. The reserve team manager in the 2014 season is Alexei Zhukov.\n\nThe women's first team was established in 2001, and it was promoted to the women's first division (\"Naisten Ykkönen\") for the 2014 season. The manager of the women's first team is Akseli Grasutis, who is assisted by coach Kari Simula.\n\nFC Viikingit have a total of twenty youth teams, thirteen for boys and seven for girls. The youth teams have a total of 602 registered players, making Viikingit the seventh largest club in Helsinki in terms of youth football.\n\nIn addition, the club runs two amateur teams in lower leagues, \"FC Viikingit 05\" and \"FC Viikingit/KoMa\". , both of these teams play in the Kutonen.\n\n"}

Hennessy (1858 – October 16, 1890) was a police chief of New Orleans, Louisiana. As a young detective, he made headlines in 1881 when he captured a notorious Italian criminal, Giuseppe Esposito. In 1888, he was promoted to superintendent and chief of police. While in office he made a number of improvements to the force, and was well known and respected in the New Orleans community.\n\nHis assassination in 1890 led to a sensational trial. A series of acquittals and mistrials angered locals, and an enormous mob formed outside the prison the next day. The prison doors were forced open and 11 of the 19 Italian men who had been indicted for Hennessy's murder were lynched. The March 14, 1891 lynchings were the largest known mass lynching in U.S. history.\n\nDavid C. Hennessy was born into an Irish Catholic family, son of Margaret and David Hennessy Sr., at 275 Girod St., New Orleans. David Sr. was a member of the First Louisiana Cavalry of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, formed after the state was occupied by Union troops. After the war, during the Reconstruction era, he served with the Metropolitan Police, a New Orleans force under the authority of the governor of Louisiana. Local white democrats generally considered the Metropolitan Police as a form of occupation army, because it protected the right of freedmen to vote, in accordance with the Fifteenth Amendment. David Sr. was murdered in 1869 by Arthur Guerin, a fellow policeman.\n\nHennessy joined the New Orleans police force as a messenger in 1870. While only a teenager, he caught two adult thieves in the act, beat them with his bare hands, and dragged them to the police station. He made detective at the age of 20.\n\nWith his cousin Michael Hennessy and private detectives James Mooney and John Boland of New York City, he arrested the notorious Italian bandit and fugitive Giuseppe Esposito in 1881. Esposito was wanted in Italy for kidnapping a British tourist and cutting off his ear, among numerous other crimes. Esposito was deported to Italy, where he was given a life sentence.\n\nIn 1882, Hennessy was tried for the murder of New Orleans Chief of Detectives Thomas Devereaux. At the time, both men were candidates for the position of chief. Hennessy argued self-defense and was found not guilty. Hennessy left the department afterwards and joined a private security firm given police powers by the city. He handled security for the New Orleans World Fair of 1884–1885. \"The New York Times\" noted that Hennessy's men were, \"neatly uniformed and are a fine-looking and intelligent body of men, far superior to the regular city force.\"\n\nIn 1888, Joseph A. Shakspeare, the nominee of the Young Men's Democratic Association, was elected mayor of New Orleans with Republican support. Having promised to end police inefficiency, Shakspeare promptly appointed Hennessy as his police chief.\n\nHennessy inherited a police force that was (according to the local press) incompetent and plagued by corruption. Under his supervision, it began to show signs of improvement.\n\nOn the evening of October 15, 1890, Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work.\nIt is likely that the gunmen were wielding sawn off shotguns - known in Italian terms as lupara - a common type of execution among Mafiosi. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor: \"Dagos.\" Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting and spoke to friends but did not name the shooters. The next day, complications set in and he died.\n\nThere had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and Mantranga families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial to clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. That would mean that the Mantrangas, not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder. A policeman, a friend of Hennessy, later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans. In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the \"Times-Democrat\" and the \"Daily Picayune\" freely blamed \"Dagoes\" for the murder. Various newspaper accounts of the era linked Hennessy's murder to Esposito and the Mafia.\n\nHennessy had been popular in New Orleans, and the pressure to catch his killers was intense. The police responded by arresting dozens of local Italians. Eventually 19 men were indicted for the murder and held without bail in the Parish Prison. The following March, nine of the accused men were tried. A series of acquittals and mistrials angered locals, and an enormous mob formed outside the prison the next day. The prison doors were forced open and 11 of the men were lynched. The incident strained U.S.-Italian relations for a time, but was eventually settled with a cash indemnity.\n\nPress coverage of the assassination and lynching was sensational and anti-Italian in tone, and generally would not meet modern journalistic standards. It was almost universally assumed that the lynched men were Mafia assassins who had deserved their fate. Since then, many historians have questioned this assumption.\n\nThe lynchings were the subject of the 1999 HBO movie \"Vendetta\", starring Christopher Walken. The movie is based on a 1977 book by Richard Gambino. \n\nOn November 24, 1893, John Williams, an African-American, was sentenced to life in prison for the rape of the 10-year-old, Rafael D'Amico. Williams was one of the state witnesses in the Hennessy murder trial. Joseph Shakspeare had ordered the sentence.\n\nHennessy is buried in Metairie Cemetery, New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana songwriter Fred Bessel published a bestselling song about Hennessy in 1891, titled \"The Hennessy Murder.\" It begins:\n\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\n\n"}

The island is an RSPB Scotland nature reserve.\n\nLike the other islands near North Berwick, Fidra is the result of volcanic activity around 335 million years ago. Fidra consists of three sections; a hill at one end with the lighthouse on it; a low-lying section in the middle, effectively an isthmus; and a rocky stack at the other end.\n\nThe island's name is believed to be Old Norse in origin, referring to the large number of bird feathers found there. Like the nearby Bass Rock, it has a substantial seabird population, and is now an RSPB reserve. The village of Gullane lies to the south-west, and the nature reserve of Yellowcraig and village of Dirleton, to which parish Fidra belongs, are to the south. Remotely operated cameras on the island send live pictures to the watching visitors at the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick.\n\nUpon the island are ruins of an old chapel, or \"lazaretto\" for the sick, which was dedicated in 1165 to St Nicholas. In the 12th-century, the island formed part of the barony of Dirleton, which was granted to the Anglo-Norman John de Vaux by King David I. The de Vaux family built a stronghold, known as Castle Tarbet, on the island, but in 1220, William de Vaux gifted Fidra to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey, in the Borders. His successor built Dirleton Castle, on the mainland, as a replacement dwelling.\n\nThe number of breeding puffins on the island has increased recently due to the removal of an introduced plant, tree mallow (\"Lavatera arborea\"). It is likely that it was planted by lighthouse keepers for use as toilet paper, and for its medicinal qualities. The shrub was blocking the entrances to the breeding burrows, and in 1996 the number of occupied burrows had fallen to approximately 400. Following clearance by RSPB Scotland staff and volunteers over 1,000 burrows are occupied in 2016.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson often visited the beaches at the area known today as Yellowcraig and it is said that he based his map of \"Treasure Island\" on the shape of Fidra. (This claim is also made about the island of Unst in Shetland.) He also mentioned Fidra in his novel \"Catriona\". Fidra Books is a publishing house, named after the island, and which uses Fidra's outline as part of its logo. The progressive rock band Marillion also briefly mention Fidra in the song, \"Warm Wet Circles\", which contains the line \"She nervously undressed in the dancing beams of the Fidra Lighthouse\", the coast nearby apparently being a well-known courting spot.\n\nThe lighthouse, which was built in 1885 and automated in 1970, is accessible via a jetty on the east coast of the island. The light flashes 4 times every 30 seconds.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It represents the primordial union of wisdom and compassion, depicted as a male deity in union with his female consort. The male figure represents compassion and skillful means, while the female partner represents insight. In yab-yum the female is seated on the male’s lap. There is a rare presentation of a similar figure but reversed, with the male sitting on the female’s lap, called\nyum-yab. \n\nThe symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra and, while there are various interpretations of the symbolism in twilight language, the male figure is usually linked to compassion (\"\") and skillful means (\"upāya-kauśalya\"), while the female partner is linked to \"wisdom\" (\"prajñā\").\n\nYab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. In Buddhism the masculine form is active, representing the compassion and skillful means (\"upaya\") that have to be developed in order to reach enlightenment. The feminine form is passive and represents wisdom (\"prajna\"), which is also necessary to enlightenment. United, the figures symbolize the union necessary to overcome the veils of Maya, the false duality of object and subject.\n\nThese figures are frequently worked in the shape of statues or reliefs, or are painted on thangkas. Yab-yum may also be represented through the aniconic signification of yantra and mandala.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the same ideas are to be found concerning the bell and the dorje, which, like the yab-yum, symbolize the dualism that must be transcended. The sacred Tantric practice leads to rapid development of mind by using the experience of bliss, non-duality, and ecstasy while in communion with one's consort, either visualized, or in the case of advanced practitioners, in some cases physical. In one important Anuttarayoga text, where Tilopa expounds the meaning to Naropa, it is said: \n\n\"\"When you rely on a consort, the wisdom of empty bliss will arise, so enter into union—the blessing of method and wisdom. Bring it down slowly, retain it, reverse it, and draw it back up. Bring it to the places in the body and let it spread throughout. When you remain free of desire, the wisdom of empty bliss will appear.\"\" \n\nIndicating the advanced nature of the actual practice with consort, the verses are the last in what is already widely considered as a text for the most advanced practitioners, a fact clearly evident in the story about Naropa's receiving the teaching.\n\nIn Hinduism the yab-yum has a slightly different meaning. There, the embraced posture represents the divine strength of creation. The Hindu concept is of a passive masculine deity embracing his spouse, called shakti, which represents his activity or power. The yab-yum of Chakrasamvara-Vajravarahi is directly influenced from the Hinduist depiction of Kali and Bhairava in union.\n\nThe symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in Tantric Buddhism, especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.\n\nAs a tantric practice, Yab-yum is akin to the Karmamudrā or \"actionseal\". This is the tantric yoga involving a physical partner. However, the aim of the practice is to control one's winds. This sadhana is part of the completion stage.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1897 as a fee paying school for girls. Notre Dame High was the last remaining single sex council school in Scotland until November 2019.\n\nIn 1894 Archbishop Eyre of Glasgow invited the Sisters of Notre Dame to come from the Mother House in Liverpool to establish a community in Glasgow. The Notre Dame Training College was opened in 1895 at Dowanhill. In 1897 Notre Dame School was opened as a private school, with a roll of 24 pupils, instructed by two teachers. By 1912, the number of pupils had risen to 193. Overcrowding led to proposals for a new building. This was designed by Thomas Cordiner in 1939, but due to the outbreak of war construction was delayed, and the building opened in 1953. In 1987, the school was protected as a category A listed building. At the same time as proposals to close the school were defeated. The former high school building and adjoining primary school building and church were damaged in a fire on 12 June 2010.\n\nThe single-sex entry criteria has been a controversial issue. Local parents campaigned for the school to become co-educational in the 1990s but the bid failed at Council committee level.\n\nIn 2016, a new campaign group of local school parents (NDH4ALL) was established to ask Glasgow City Council to reconsider the single sex entry criteria and allow access to both girls and boys in the local catchment area. \n\nA public consultation on Notre Dame High's entry criteria was launched in March 2019 and ran for a period of 10 weeks. The consultation received a high level of publicity and engagement, with almost 5000 responses counted. Glasgow City Council also conducted three high profile public meetings during the consultation period. The meetings saw attendance in the hundreds with many pupils speaking of their experiences. \n\nConsultation results were released in August 2019 revealing that, of the three options proposed, co-education received the highest number of responses (45.7%). \n\nIn November 2019 a consultation response report was published by Glasgow City Council Education Services in conjunction with Education Scotland. The report recommended that Notre Dame High become co-educational. A final vote on the recommendation by the Glasgow City Council City Administration Committee took place on 28 November 2019, with the committee unanimously voting to make the school co-educational.\n\nThe Head Teacher is Mrs Rosemary Martin who succeeded Philomena McFadden in 2014.\n\n\n\n"}

If the shot is played fast enough, it will supposedly not allow the opponent to hit it back. They also should be able to, if the opponent hits it, it will give you the mid and back-court space to exploit.\n\nA good drop shot requires great touch. The ball should bounce low and near the net, sometimes with \"underspin\" (or \"backspin\"). Backspin slows the ball and decreases the height of its bounce. In some extreme cases, the ball will bounce back towards the net. Sidespin may also be put on the ball so it kicks sideways when it bounces. A bad drop shot is one that travels too deep into the court, or bounces too high. When this happens, the opponent can get to the ball, and make an easy play. A very soft drop shot, that just barely travels over the net, is sometimes called a dink (a term possibly borrowed from volleyball). \n\nMaking the drop shot a surprise also makes it more effective. If opponents are expecting a normal shot, they may not be in position to run forward to make a good play on a drop shot. \n\nThe characteristics of some court surfaces make drop shots particularly effective; grass and clay are good examples. On grass, the ball tends to bounce lower than other courts, which makes it harder to retrieve a drop shot. On clay, the slow surface tends to encourage players to stay far back and engage in rallies from behind the baseline, which in turn increases the distance the player must cover to reach a drop shot near the net. Drop shots on hard courts can be useful, although to a lesser degree. Drop shots are also useful when the wind is blowing in the opposite direction of the shot; this allows spin without hitting the shot too long.\n\nA drop shot hit with a volley is aptly coined a \"drop volley\". The secret to making a good drop volley is having \"soft hands.\" To achieve this, a player slightly loosens his or her grip on the racquet at the moment of impact with the ball. This allows the racquet to absorb more force and reduces the ball's rebound. This stroke was mastered by one of the greatest serve and volleyers of all time, John McEnroe.\n\nThe drop shot became unpopular in the 1990s, but has experienced a recent popularity due to its success rate. The drop shot is most commonly used by clay court specialists.\n"}

Prior to its inception, Indian railway passengers had little options for quality food while travelling. Passengers have to get off from trains at stations and buy sub-standard and unhygienic food available. The short halt at stations and the sudden surge in crowd at the stalls added to the travelers' panic.

He joined the Rutgers faculty in 1994 and retired in 2018. \n\nHe is married to the ethicist Holly Martin Smith.\n\nGoldman has done influential work on a wide range of philosophical topics, but his principal areas of research are epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science.\n\nGoldman's early book, \"A Theory of Human Action\" (a revised version of his Ph.D. thesis), presents a systematic way of classifying and relating the many actions we perform at any time. Its influence was broad and can be found in, among other writings, John Rawls' book \"A Theory of Justice\". Goldman's early work in action theory soon gave way to work in other branches of philosophy, most influentially epistemology.\n\nGoldman's accounts of knowledge and justified belief, using notions like causation and reliability instead of normative concepts like permissibility and obligation, contributed to a philosophical approach that came to be known in the 1970s as naturalized epistemology. (Unlike W.V.O. Quine's version of naturalized epistemology, however, Goldman's retains a traditional focus on questions of justification.) Goldman's view emerged initially as part of the efforts in the 1960s to find a \"fourth\" condition in response to the Gettier challenge to the account of knowledge as \"justified true belief.\" In his 1967 paper, \"A Causal Theory of Knowing\", Goldman proposed that knowledge amounts to true belief appropriately caused by the fact that makes it true. Later, he claimed knowledge amounts to true belief that is produced by a reliable process.\n\nGoldman has described his \"naturalistic\" approach to epistemology as splitting \"epistemology (individual epistemology, anyway) into two parts... The first part is dedicated to the 'analytic' task of identifying the criteria, or satisfaction conditions, for various normative epistemic statuses. With respect to the normative status of justifiedness (of belief), the proposed criterion is the reliability of the belief-forming processes by which the belief is produced. Defense of this criterion of justifiedness was not based on scientific psychology, but rather a familiar form of armchair methodology. The second part is the task where science enters the picture. Psychological science is required to identify the kinds of operations or computations available to the human cognizer, how well they work when operating on certain inputs and under certain conditions.\"\n\nMore recently, Goldman has focused his epistemological efforts on questions of social epistemology, of the different social mechanisms through which knowledge is transmitted in society. His work in social epistemology has dealt with the law (especially evidence), voting and media, among other topics. He attempts to provide (in his words) a less radical view of social epistemology than those suggested by cultural theorists and postmodernists under that name. His approach uses tools of analytic philosophy especially formal epistemology to analyze problems in social knowledge. Some of this work is summarized in his book \"Knowledge in a Social World\".\n\nGoldman has devoted significant time to showing how research in cognitive science is relevant to a variety of branches of philosophy including epistemology. Much of this work appears in his books \"Epistemology and Cognition\", \"Philosophical Applications of Cognitive Science\", and \"Simulating Minds\".\n\n\n\n"}

It measured and was discovered by prospectors John Deason and Richard Oates on 5 February 1869 at Moliagul, Victoria, Australia, about 14.6 kilometres (9 miles) north-west of Dunolly.\n\nFound only below the surface, near the base of a tree on a slope leading to what was then known as Bulldog Gully, the nugget had a gross weight of (241 lb 10 oz). Its trimmed weight was (210 lbs), and its net weight was (192 lbs 11.5 oz).\n\nAt the time of the discovery, there were no scales capable of weighing a nugget this large, so it was broken into three pieces on an anvil by Dunolly-based blacksmith Archibald Walls.\n\nDeason, Oates, and a few friends took the nugget to the London Chartered Bank of Australia, in Dunolly, which advanced them £9,000. Deason and Oates were finally paid an estimated £9,381 for their nugget, which became known as the \"Welcome Stranger\". At August 2019 gold prices, it would be worth US$3.4 million [2.3 million GBP]. It was heavier than the \"Welcome Nugget\" of that had been found in Ballarat in 1858. The goldfields warden F. K. Orme reported that 2,269 ounces (189 lbs 1 oz) 10 dwt 14 grains (70.5591 kg) of smelted gold had been obtained from it, irrespective of scraps that were given away by the finders, estimated as totalling another 47 ounces (3 lbs 11 oz) 7 dwt.\n\nThe nugget was soon melted down and the gold was sent as ingots to Melbourne for forwarding to the Bank of England. It left the country on board the steamship \"Reigate\" which departed on 21 February.\n\nAn obelisk commemorating the discovery of the \"Welcome Stranger\" was erected near the spot in 1897. A replica of the \"Welcome Stranger\" is in the Old Treasury building, Treasury Place, Melbourne, Victoria; another replica is owned by descendants of John Deason and is now on display at the Dunolly Rural Transaction Center..\n\nJohn Deason was born in 1829 on the island of Tresco, Isles of Scilly, south-west of Cornwall, England, UK. In 1851, he was a tin dresser before becoming a gold miner. Deason continued with gold mining and workings most of his life and, although he became a store keeper at Moliagul, he lost a substantial proportion of his wealth through poor investments in gold mining. He bought a small farm near Moliagul where he lived until he died in 1915, aged 85 years.\n\nRichard Oates was born about 1827 at Pendeen in Cornwall. After the 1869 find, Oates returned to the UK and married. He returned to Australia with his wife and they had four children. The Oates family, in 1895, purchased of land at Marong, Victoria, about west of Bendigo, Victoria, which Oates farmed until his death in Marong in 1906, aged 79 years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079510", "title": "SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes", "text": "SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes\n\nThe SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, collectively known as Light Pacifics or informally as \"Spam Cans\", are air-smoothed 4-6-2 \"Pacific\" steam locomotives designed for the Southern Railway by its Chief Mechanical Engineer Oliver Bulleid. Incorporating a number of new developments in British steam locomotive technology, they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process, and to use steel fireboxes, which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post-war economy.\n\nThey were designed to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives, the Merchant Navy class, to permit use on a wider variety of routes, including in the south-west of England and the Kent coast. They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently far below their capabilities. A total of 110 locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.\n\nDue to problems with some of the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. The results were similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives are preserved on heritage railways in Britain.\n\nThe financial success enjoyed by the Southern Railway during the 1930s was based on the completion of its London suburban electrification scheme in 1929 and the subsequent electrification of the main lines to Brighton and the Sussex Coast and to Guildford and Portsmouth. Despite electrification plans, the Southern Railway's less heavily used lines in the West Country beyond Salisbury did not merit the cost. Lines in Devon and Cornwall were meandering, heavily graded, and although with heavy summer holiday traffic were lightly used during the winter months. The seasonality of railway traffic meant that the West Country branches were worked by the ageing T9 class 4-4-0 and the versatile N class 2-6-0, which could be better utilised on mixed-traffic services elsewhere. As a result, an order was placed with Brighton railway works in April 1941 for twenty passenger locomotives of a type to be determined.\n\nDuring 1943, Bulleid began planning for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified the need for a stop-gap steam locomotive design for those main lines in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new Merchant Navy class was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following the war, would require a lighter locomotive with wider route availability.\n\nAt the same time, there would be a continuing need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe detailed design work for the new mixed-traffic locomotives was undertaken at Brighton railway works where they were scheduled to be constructed. The earliest drawings were for a moderately sized 2-6-0 with similarities to the London and North Eastern Railway K4 class, which Bulleid had helped design for the West Highland Line when he was Nigel Gresley's assistant. However, such a design would have been inadequate for the Kent Coast lines, which required a powerful 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 class. It is not clear why the design was subsequently enlarged to become a smaller version of the Merchant Navy class 4-6-2 as the likely traffic requirement did not warrant such lavish provision, but the incorporation of components from that class enabled standardisation during wartime production difficulties.\n\nIn order to improve on the route availability of the Merchant Navy class with its 21-ton axle loading, the weight was reduced by 5 tons. This allowed the design to operate on routes where the Maunsell 2-6-0s were the largest permitted and came mainly from several changes:\nAlso the cab was reduced in width and remodelled to comply with reduced loading gauge over some routes.\n\nBased on the mechanical experience gained from the Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because it was difficult to access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.\n\nThe locomotive also carried a similar \"air-smoothed\" casing to the Merchant Navy class. This was not regarded as streamlining by Bulleid, a fact demonstrated by the flat front end. Authorities differ as to the purpose of the casing. According to Creer it was intended to be an aid in cleaning the locomotive with carriage washers to reduce labour requirements during the post-war period, whereas Bradley asserts that the intention was to lift the steam and exhaust gases away from the cab. As with the Merchant Navies, the class soon gained the nickname \"Spam Cans\", due to the resemblance to the distinctive tin cans in which \"SPAM\" was sold.\n\nThe smokebox was an integral part of the air-smoothed casing, being a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox that acted as a former to maintain the shape of the casing. In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.\n\nAs with the Merchant Navy class, electric lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, powered by a steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, making it easier for the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.\n\nCompared with the Merchant Navy class, shorter overall length led to shorter frames and reduced the wheelbase to .\n\nThe boiler was also shorter and of smaller diameter at the smokebox end, but retaining the operating pressure.\n\nThe inner and outer Belpaire firebox was also smaller than the Merchant Navy class also constructed using welded steel.\n\nThe cylinders were smaller at .\n\nBulleid designed a reduced capacity tender based upon the Merchant Navy version. It could carry water and of coal on a six-wheel underframe. It retained the BFB wheels and streamlining panels, or \"raves\", that gave the top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to carriages. As with the Merchant Navy class, the water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that on the locomotive. Four train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space.\n\nThe first batch of twenty locomotives was ordered in April 1941, although the changes in design to the \"Light Pacific\" arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before the first of the class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 \"Exeter\", and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front driving wheel, with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the filler pipes.\n\nA third batch of twenty-five was ordered and designated the \"Battle of Britain\" class. These were identical to the \"West Country\" class and the new designation was purely concerned with giving the locomotives names that befitted their intended allocation to the Eastern Section. By the time of the nationalisation of British Railways in January 1948, seventy \"Light Pacifics\" had been built at Brighton Works, with a fourth batch of twenty on order. There was a delay in production during the first three months of British Railways control but the last twenty ordered by the Southern Railway entered traffic between April 1948 and February 1949.\n\nIn March 1949, British Railways ordered a final 20 from Brighton works despite a pressing need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one examples of the LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.\nThe completion of the final locomotive, No. 34110 \"66 Squadron\", in January 1951 was delayed for several months pending consideration of proposals from British Railways management for a major modification to a standard two-cylinder design without the chain-driven valve gear., but the locomotive entered service as Bulleid intended.\n\nThe first six locomotives were initially fitted with plywood sheeting over the cab-side windows as a wartime material-saving measure, with No. 21C107 \"Wadebridge\" the first to receive glass windows. Two of the front route indicator irons (of which there are five) were originally located on the smoke deflectors, which meant that the indicator discs stood proud of the casing. This necessitated a trial relocation to the smokebox door at the three and nine o'clock positions on No. 21C109 \"Lyme Regis\", and fitted as standard from No. 21C118 \"Axminster\" onwards. The batch constructed between June and October 1946 received a modified steam regulator and LMS-style parallel buffer casings.\n\nAs with the Merchant Navy class, they were fitted with a new design of cab front spectacle plates from mid–1947 due to poor forward visibility. The small windows on the front face of the cab were redesigned to an angled profile, giving improved visibility to the driver. This was a feature fitted to all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. They were introduced in Britain in 1934 with the Gresley-designed \"Cock o' the North\". Over the next decade the revised design was fitted to existing members of the class. Another modification was the reduction of boiler pressure to to reduce maintenance costs.\n\nThe Southern Railway-built batches had a narrow footplate due to the width-restricted Hastings Line between Tonbridge and Hastings but these were never used on this duty and the cab was widened to on the British Railways batch. The tenders of Nos. 21C166–21C170 were fitted with TIA (\"Traitement Integral Armand\") chemical feed-water equipment that precipitated scale-forming constituents in the hard water of southern England into a non-adhesive mud that could be cleared using a manual \"blow-down\" valve. This equipment was retrospectively fitted to earlier members of the class. In 1948 the tender design was enlarged to provide a water capacity of .\n\nTo ease maintenance and lubrication, panels of air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders were removed from 1952, and the front sanders were blanked off. This coincided with the removal of the tender \"raves\" on all but five locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing. The resultant \"cut-down\" tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.\n\nWhen the rebuilding programme (see below) was halted in 1961, further modifications were made to the unrebuilt locomotives. The most notable was on No. 34064 \"Fighter Command\", which was fitted with a Giesl ejector in 1962 on the grounds that a desired spark arrestor would \"suffocate\" an ordinary blastpipe. Following some adjustment, the ejector improved smoke deflection and fuel consumption, allowing it to steam well with low-grade coal. As a consequence of the positive experience with No. 34064, preserved No. 34092 \"City of Wells\" was similarly fitted in the mid-1980s.\n\nBulleid employed the same idiosyncratic numbering scheme that he had used for the Merchant Navy class, beginning at No. 21C101 and reaching No. 21C170 at the time of nationalisation. His scheme was abolished by British Railways, which renumbered existing these 34001-34070 and new locomotives 34071-34110.\nThe first 48 members of the class were named after places in the West Country served by its trains or close to its lines. This represented a publicity success due to many of the locomotives being able to visit their namesake areas. Many 'West Country' locomotives sported an additional plaque with the coat of arms of the town or region the locomotive was named after. This plaque was mounted on the casing between the gunmetal locomotive nameplate and the \"West Country Class\" scroll, above the middle driving wheel. Several members of the class had only the nameplate and the \"West Country Class\" scroll, a gap being left where a crest would have been mounted. The background of the nameplate was usually painted red, though sometimes examples could be found in black if the locomotive works undertaking overhaul of the engine could not locate the correct colour paint.\nOnce it became clear that the locomotives would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.\n\nThe first locomotives constructed by British Railways were of the Battle of Britain class, but the naming policy reverted to the West Country for Nos. 34091–34108. The final two locomotives were Battle of Britain class, No. 34109 \"Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory\" and No. 34110 \"66 Squadron\". The result of the delay in completing was that the squadron crest for \"66 Squadron\" was never made, as the manufacturer had retired during the intervening period. Thus \"66 Squadron\" was the only Battle of Britain class member not to have a crest.\n\nThe original intention was to base the first batch of locomotives at Exmouth Junction depot at Exeter for use on the West of England Main Line to Salisbury and Plymouth, and secondary lines to Barnstaple, Bude and other holiday resorts in Devon and Cornwall. By the winter of 1945, there was a more pressing need for them on Kent Coast services. The class also began to be used on Continental Boat Trains to and from Dover and Folkestone once these were resumed in 1946. Later batches were used on cross-country services such as the Brighton to Bournemouth, Cardiff and Plymouth trains or the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway trains from Bournemouth to Wells and Bath.\n\nBecause of the good route availability the locomotives could be used on non-electrified lines between London and Brighton. These included the Oxted Line, and occasionally the Bluebell Line between East Grinstead and Lewes, where they were also used for freight and parcels traffic, and excursion trains over electrified lines. Thus the original intention for the West Country class locomotives to work in South West England and the Battle of Britain class in Kent, Hampshire, Sussex and Surrey was never operationally practical and both classes were to be found all over the network. The most important journey undertaken by a member of the class occurred on 30 January 1965, when No.34051 \"Winston Churchill\" hauled the funeral train of its namesake from Waterloo station to his final resting place, close to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.\n\nAs with the Merchant Navy class, they could generate great power using mediocre quality fuel, due largely to Bulleid's excellent boiler. They also ran smoothly at high speed, but they were also beset with the same technical problems of their larger sisters. These may be summarised as follows:\n\n\nRestricted driver visibility was mentioned in the report on the disastrous Lewisham rail crash on 4 December 1957 outside St John's railway station, in which 90 people were killed and 173 injured. The driver of No. 34066 \"Spitfire\" had failed to see one yellow and one double-yellow \"caution\" signal in foggy conditions and was travelling too fast to stop when he saw a red signal, and the train crashed into the back of a stationary local train. Members of the class were later fitted with Automatic Warning System equipment, a recommendation of the incident report; fitting of trackside equipment was already underway, but priority had been given to routes equipped with semaphore signals, not electric \"colour-light\" signals as at Lewisham.\n\nThe report on the disaster indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right-hand side of the train and because of the limited visibility from the left-hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left-hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards of visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could have been seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.\n\nDue to the problems experienced with the class, and following the success of the rebuilt Merchant Navy class designed by R. G. Jarvis, British Railways ordered the rebuilding of sixty locomotives to a more conventional design at Eastleigh between 1957 and 1961. The first locomotive to be rebuilt was No. 34005 \"Barnstaple\", which adopted many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes. The casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, boiler pressure reduced to and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with modified Walschaerts valve gear fitted both outside as well as between the frames. The rapid onset of the 1955 Modernisation Plan during the early 1960s meant that the remaining fifty locomotives were not rebuilt, and continued in as-built condition until withdrawal.\n\nThe rebuilding solved most of the maintenance problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning that they could not be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.\n\nThe electrification of the Chatham Main Line to Dover and Ramsgate in 1959 deprived the class of some of its work, as did the transfer of the lines west of Salisbury to the Western Region on 30 December 1962. This resulted in the withdrawal of several unrebuilt locomotives stabled at Exmouth Junction shed in June 1963. By the end of the year ten had been withdrawn, including the 12‑year-old No. 34110 \"66 Squadron\", having travelled only 600,000 miles. Most of the unrebuilt locomotives were withdrawn over the next three years but seven survived until 1967 and the end of steam on the Southern Region. Many rebuilt locomotives were withdrawn soon after their rebuilding. The first was No. 34028 \"Eddystone\" in May 1964, having run only 287,000 miles since rebuilding. Other early withdrawals included No. 34109 \"Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory\" which had only travelled 162,000 miles in the three and a half years since its rebuilding. \n\nTwenty \"Light Pacifics\" still exist, in varying states of preservation: two were acquired directly from BR for preservation, 34023 \"Blackmoor Vale\" & 34051 \"Winston Churchill\"; the other eighteen being purchased from Barry Scrapyard. Of these twenty class members to survive, ten are in original form, whilst ten are in \"rebuilt\" form. Had it not been for Woodham Brothers' scrapyard in Barry, South Wales, no rebuilt \"Light Pacifics\" would have been preserved. Eleven of the surviving engines are named after West Country locations in the South of England and the remaining nine after RAF Squadrons or significant persons, including Prime Minister Winston Churchill. All but one of the class in preservation were built at Brighton Works, the exception being 34101 \"Hartland\" which was built at Eastleigh Works. The class has proved to be useful for preservation societies, due to its good route availability and ample power, with some having returned to the main line to haul special trains. It is uncertain whether all of the preserved locomotives will be restored to working order; owing to the very poor condition some of them were in when purchased and the increasing cost of materials.\n\nOther relics of both classes that have survived are nameplates, which were removed towards the end of steam on the British Railways Southern Region in the 1960s. As a result, many exist in private collections, and several have been seen at auction, selling for several thousands of pounds.\n\nJust four members of the class are yet to run in preservation: 34010 \"Sidmouth\", which is awaiting restoration from scrapyard condition (its boiler is stored at Bridgnorth); 34051 \"Winston Churchill\", which is on static display at the National Railway Museum in York; 34058 \"Sir Frederick Pile\", which is under restoration at the Mid Hants Railway; and 34073 \"249 Squadron\", which is awaiting restoration at Carnforth MPD. Of the sixteen engines which have operated in preservation, six have operated on the main line: 34016 \"Bodmin\", 34027 \"Taw Valley\", 34046 \"Braunton\", 34067 \"Tangmere\", 34072 \"257 Squadron\" & 34092 \"City of Wells\". 34046 is the only member of the class operating currently that has a valid main line certificate. 34028 \"Eddystone\" and 34070 \"Manston\" did briefly return to the mainline in 2009 to attend an event at Eastleigh, but the two engines were towed behind a diesel as neither was mainline certified.\n\nLivery was Southern Railway malachite green with \"Sunshine yellow\" horizontal lining. A circular cast brass plate with a red background on the smokebox door featured the word \"Southern\" and the date of manufacture. Bulleid advocated a continental style of numbering, basing this upon his experiences at the French branch of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War, and his tenure in the Railway Operating Division (R.O.D.) during that conflict. The Southern Railway number adapted the UIC classification system where \"2\" and \"1\" refer to the number of un-powered leading and trailing axles respectively, and \"C\" refers to the number of driving axles, in this case three. However, since \"21C\" was the prefix already used by the Merchant Navy class, the suffix \"1\" was added; these locomotives carried numbers that started \"21C1\" followed by the individual two-digit identifier.\n\nInitial livery after nationalisation in 1948 was British Railways malachite green and \"Sunshine yellow\" lining and lettering, with British Railways on the tender. No. 34090 \"Sir Eustace Missenden, Southern Railway\" was given commemorative malachite green livery that included green-painted wheels with yellow rims and the early British Railways crest on the tender. The Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained on the first seventy locomotives with the addition of an \"s\" prefix (e.g. s21C101). The classes were given several power classifications in their careers, beginning with 6MT (Mixed Traffic) in 1949. In December 1953 they were reclassified 7P 5FA, the \"A\" denoting brake power when used on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) goods trains. The rebuilt locomotives retained this classification until all received the classification of 7P6F between November 1957 and November 1961.\n\nThe locomotives were turned out in British Railways Brunswick green livery with orange and black lining with the British Railways crest on the tender side, after their first overhaul under new ownership. This was unlike the Merchant Navy class, which was initially turned out in British Railways experimental express passenger blue livery. By this stage, the Southern Railway-built locomotives were re-liveried and renumbered from 34001–34070. The rebuilt locomotives were also in British Railways Brunswick green with orange and black lining, and crest on the tender side, whilst the nameplates were placed on a custom-made mounting on the running plate due to the absence of a flat surface.\n\nSome of the locomotives had additional embellishments. No. 34050 \"Royal Observer Corps\" was presented with an ROC long-service medal in July 1961. The ceremony took place at Waterloo station, and included Commandant ROC Air Commodore Wight-Boycott. The cab side was given a representation of the medal and its ribbon, which was displayed until the engine was withdrawn from service and scrapped in the late 1960s. The original nameplate and crest were recovered and displayed in the entrance hall of ROC Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory until 1996 when they were transferred to the RAF Museum at Hendon. Another locomotive that featured a second crest was 34067 \"Tangmere\", which was given the airfield's crest for the cab side, as it did not feature on the nameplate crest.\n\nThe class in both unrebuilt and rebuilt forms has been the subject of divergent opinions. The use of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title \"Last Giant of Steam\". The steam-raising ability of their boilers represented an advance in British steam technology. Their light axle-loading also meant widespread use over the Southern network, and they were capable of fast running.\n\nDespite these successes, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more \"Light Pacifics\" were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a \"Light Pacific\" hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.\n\nKitmaster produced an unpowered polystyrene injection-moulded kit for 00 gauge from 1960. In late 1962, the brand was sold to Airfix, which resumed production in 1968. The moulds later passed to Dapol, which continues to produce the kit. Hornby manufactures ready-to-run rebuilt and un-rebuilt examples of the class and caters for all the major detail variations. Graham Farish produces ready-to-run models in N gauge, and Dapol has announced its intention to produce models in N gauge, slated for release in May 2012. Hornby Dublo produced diecast metal \"rebuilt\" West Countries in the 1960s, and those became Triang-Wrenn, and ultimately Wrenn Railways. Wrenn produced air-smoothed versions and rebuilt versions, right through to their demise (and subsequent sale to Dapol) in the early 1990s.\n\n\n"}

In an infamous swerve, the latter would eventually be revealed as the power behind The Corporate Ministry who had intended to use the faction to destroy Austin.\n\nThroughout early 1999, The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness had been feuding with WWF owner Mr. McMahon, trying to gain control of the Federation. To break Vince's spirits they began targeting his daughter Stephanie. Worried about his daughter, Vince shifted focus from his Corporation stable to Stephanie. With Vince occupied, his son Shane gradually took over the leadership of the Corporation. On April 12, Shane kicked Vince, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco out of the Corporation. His rationale was that there was no room in the Corporation for the old and that Vince no longer had his priorities straight. Shane then slapped his father, saying that the strong, ruthless man he knew was gone.\n\nHeading into WrestleMania XV, Vince McMahon had been feuding with Stone Cold Steve Austin for an entire year. By this point, the Corporation was involved in the feud as well. The Rock, Vince's handpicked champion, lost his WWF Championship to Austin at WrestleMania XV and also lost a rematch at . Rock blamed the loss on Shane, who had been guest referee and accidentally hit Rock with the championship belt near the end of the match. The following night on \"Raw Is War\", Rock insulted Shane and hit him \"Rock Bottom\" and was in turn fired from the Corporation.\n\nAt Backlash, the Ministry kidnapped Stephanie. The Undertaker attempted to wed and sacrifice her the following night, but was ruined successfully by Stone Cold Steve Austin after two failed attempts by Ken Shamrock and the Big Show. Members of The Corporation had wanted to help Stephanie, but Shane held them back apparently trying to convince them that it could be a Ministry trap.\n\nOn April 27, the pilot episode of \"SmackDown!\", The Undertaker merged his Ministry of Darkness with Shane's Corporation to form the Corporate Ministry. The two groups united in order to fight their common foes Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Mr. McMahon. The members of both factions seemingly forgot their past conflicts and worked together as a massive stable.\n\nOn the following episode of \"Raw Is War\", a new faction formed to oppose the Corporate Ministry. Former Corporation members Ken Shamrock, Big Show, and Test joined together with Mankind to form The Union. The Union members felt that they were being screwed over by the Corporation ever since Shane had taken control of it from his father. Wanting revenge on his son, Vince soon united with the Union as they fought with the Corporate Ministry.\n\nAs the Corporate Ministry's first act, Shane ordered a WWF Championship match at Over the Edge between Austin and Undertaker with himself as a special guest referee. However, WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels countered by adding Vince as another guest referee. That night, an altercation between the feuding McMahons collected Undertaker and Austin, and Shane fast-counted the pin to give the match and the title to Undertaker. That same night, The Rock defeated Triple H via disqualification and The Union defeated The Acolytes, Viscera, and Big Bossman in an elimination match. A week later, The Acolytes defeated X-Pac and Kane to win the WWF Tag Team Championship.\n\nMeanwhile, The Undertaker's claim that he served a higher power was expanded upon. Eventually, The Undertaker decided to offer Austin to this greater power, who revealed his identity to Austin while dressed in a black robe and a hood that hid his face from the audience. On June 7, the identity of the higher power was revealed as Vince McMahon, and the entire exercise had been a ruse designed to allow the McMahons to get revenge on Austin. After the unveiling, Linda and Stephanie McMahon, who were also victims of the ruse, used their combined 50% share in the WWF to punish Vince. Linda stepped down as CEO of the company, naming Austin as her replacement. Further, she and Stephanie were signing over their shares of the WWF to Austin. The Undertaker has stated that he considers the Corporate Ministry stable to be the low point of his \"dark\" era due to the diluting of power from himself to the McMahons.\n\nThe McMahons challenged Austin to a winner-take-all handicap match at the King of the Ring. The match became a ladder match after Big Boss Man lost a match to Austin, allowing Austin to pick the stipulation. To punish him for the loss, Big Bossman was fired from the Corporate Ministry.\n\nWith Steve Austin now feuding with the McMahons, The Undertaker faced a new challenger, The Rock. After Rock beat The Undertaker and Triple H in a handicap match, The Undertaker faced The Rock at King of the Ring for the title. Undertaker won the match, thanks to a run-in by Triple H. That same night, Vince and Shane defeated Austin in a ladder match to win his 50% share of the company and regain full control of the WWF. The following week, The Acolytes lost their tag team titles to the Hardy Boyz. Big Boss Man rejoined the Corporate Ministry the night after King of the Ring.\n\nAfter King of the Ring, Austin reinserted himself into a feud with The Undertaker by announcing that, while still CEO, he booked himself a title rematch with Undertaker, with the time and place to be determined by Austin. On the \"Raw Is War\" after King of the Ring, Austin defeated the Undertaker to regain the WWF Championship.\n\nAt Fully Loaded, a First Blood match was signed with two stipulations. If Undertaker regained the title, Austin could never challenge for it again. If Austin was to retain, Vince McMahon would be forced to leave the WWF. Austin won by hitting The Undertaker with a television camera after an assist from X-Pac, thus retaining the title and forcing Vince out of the company. Meanwhile, The Acolytes defeated The Hardy Boyz and their manager Michael Hayes to regain the tag team titles, and Triple H defeated The Rock in a leather strap match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. and Big Bossman won the hardcore title from Al Snow. Two weeks later, the Acolytes would lose the tag team titles to X-Pac and Kane.\n\nBy the end of July, The Undertaker's relationship with the McMahons had dissolved and the Corporate Ministry was effectively disbanded by Shane McMahon on August 2, 1999. Shane continued to align himself with Triple H and Chyna, and on the \"Raw Is War\" following SummerSlam he helped Triple H defeat Mankind to win his first WWF Championship. The Acolytes stayed together and continued to wrestle under that name with no connection to anyone, eventually becoming the APA. Big Bossman continued his feud with Al Snow.\n\nThe Undertaker, in the meantime, formed a new tag team with Big Show called the \"Unholy Alliance\", which eventually grew into a loose stable that included former Ministry members Mideon and Viscera. They defeated X-Pac and Kane at SummerSlam for the WWF Tag Team Championship, only to lose them a week later to the makeshift tag team of Mankind and The Rock, which became better known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. The following week, they regained the tag team titles in a Buried Alive match after Triple H buried Mankind following an attack on Big Show.\n\nShortly after this, it was found that Undertaker suffered a torn groin and would require surgery, which necessitated a change in storyline. The team's scheduled defense against the former champions on \"Raw Is War\" two weeks later was turned into a Dark Side Rules match where any of the members of the Unholy Alliance could wrestle. This enabled Undertaker to avoid aggravating his injury, although the group lost the tag team titles back to the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.\n\nAfter Austin who told McMahon that according to the previous contract (which includes the \"fine print\" also according to Austin) the following night on RAW, he would reinstate him, provided that Austin granted him his title shot. McMahon agreed and considered himself reinstated and granted him the title shot, but told him that he will meet the winner of the match at Unforgiven. During that time, Undertaker was also set to compete in a Six-Pack Challenge WWF Championship match at Unforgiven against The Rock, Mankind, Kane, Big Show, and Triple H, requiring a change in those plans as well. One week after the group lost the tag team titles for the final time, Mr. McMahon forced Triple H to take part in a gauntlet match to keep his spot in the Unforgiven main event, with each match being considered the \"specialty\" match of the competitors. Undertaker was originally set to face Triple H in a casket match as part of the gauntlet, but Undertaker refused to compete and walked out on Mr. McMahon.<ref name=\"WWF SmackDown! - 09/23/1999\"></ref><ref name=\"WWF SmackDown 09/23/1999\"></ref> Mideon and Viscera, who earlier had interfered in Triple H's inferno match against Kane, were forced to take Undertaker's place and won the match after Triple H was unable to put both men in a casket.\n\nAfter that, the remaining members of what was left of the Ministry went their separate ways. Big Show became the WWF Champion at that year's Survivor Series, while Viscera won the WWF Hardcore Championship and was eventually let go from the company. Mideon disappeared for some time after Unforgiven, returning first as an impostor version of Mankind and then as \"Naked Mideon\" before leaving the company himself. Joey Abs made his debut by joining The Mean Street Posse; he wasn't a member of the Corporate Ministry, but debuted under the Corporate Ministry banner.\n\n\n\n"}

It is ligand for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and it is related to transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). This protein interacts with the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to promote the growth of normal epithelial cells.\n\nAREG is a critical factor in estrogen action and ductal development of the mammary glands. Amphiregulin has been found to be essential for mammary ductal development, as evidenced by absence of ductal growth in amphiregulin knockout mice. This is similar to the phenotypes of EGFR and ERα knockout mice, which also show absence of ductal growth. Amphiregulin is expressed in many parts of body such as ovaries, placenta, pancreas, breasts, lungs and spleen. Expression of amphiregulin can be induced by TGF-α, TNF-α, interleukin 1, and prostaglandins.\n\nMutations in this encoded protein are associated with a psoriasis-like skin phenotype. Higher circulating levels of amphiregulin are associated with AGVHD progression. \n\nOverexpression of amphiregulin is connected with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon, pancreas, lung, spleen, and bladder.\n\nIt seems that expression of AREG is connected with proliferation of fibroblasts and production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\nAmphiregulin is part of cellular response type 2. It was found that the cell source of amphiregulin is innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2) which are dependent on interleukin 33. ILC2 expressed amphiregulin after tissue damage of the intestines and activation by IL-33. Moreover, endogenous AREG with IL-33 decreased the intestinal inflammation in mice with normal count of T-lymphocytes and in deficient mice.\n\n"}

Around this table were several circular, elliptic or octagonal tiers with railings, steeply tiered so that students or other observers could stand and get a good view of the dissection almost from above and unencumbered by the spectators in the rows in front. It was common to display skeletons at some place in the theatre; in Leiden, 17th-century depictions show that the living observers were actually accompanied in the rows by a large number of animal and human skeletons, some of which held banners with inscriptions such as \"Memento mori\", or, freely translated, \"Remember, you will die\".\n\nThe first anatomical Theatre was built at the University of Padua in 1594 and is still preserved.\nOther early examples include the Theatrum Anatomicum of Leiden University, built in 1596 and reconstructed in 1988, and the Anatomical Theatre of the Archiginnasio in Bologna (whose building dates from 1563 and the anatomical theatre from 1637).\n\nThe anatomical theatre completed in 1663 by medical professor and amateur architect Olaus Rudbeck for the University of Uppsala is located in the idiosyncratic cupola which Rudbeck placed on top of the Gustavianum building, at the time the main building of the university.

Nabiximols is sold as a mouth spray intended to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms of multiple sclerosis; it was developed by the UK company GW Pharmaceuticals. In 2019 it was proposed that following application of the spray, nabiximols is washed away from the oral mucosa by the saliva flow and ingested into the stomach, with subsequent absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract. Nabiximols is a combination drug standardized in composition, formulation, and dose. Its principal active cannabinoid components are the cannabinoids: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Each spray delivers a dose of 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD.\n\nIn May 2003 GW Pharmaceuticals and Bayer entered into an exclusive marketing agreement for GW's cannabis-based medicinal extract product, to be marketed under the brand name Sativex. \"Bayer has obtained exclusive rights to market Sativex in the UK. In addition, Bayer has the option for a limited period to negotiate the marketing rights in other countries in European Union and selected other countries around the world.\"\n\nIn April 2011, GW licensed to Novartis the rights to commercialise nabiximols in Asia (excluding China and Japan), Africa and the Middle East (excluding Israel).\n\nIn June 2010, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom licensed nabiximols as a prescription-only medicine for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. This regulatory authorization represents the world's first full regulatory approval for the medicine. The spray is being marketed in the UK by Bayer Schering Pharma. Many people with MS cannot receive nabiximols due to local National Health Service (NHS) resistance to its funding; but, in August 2014, the NHS in Wales agreed to fund Sativex for people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nNabiximols was also approved in Spain for MS spasticity in the second half of 2010 and was launched in that country in March 2011. It was approved in the Czech Republic in April 2011, in Germany in May 2011, in Denmark in June 2011 and in Sweden in January 2012 to people with MS who have not responded adequately to other medication for spasticity. It has also been recommended for approval in Italy and Austria with formal approvals expected in these countries during 2011. In Spain and other European markets (excluding the UK), nabiximols will be marketed by Almirall.\n\nIn Canada, nabiximols has been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of MS spasticity. It has also received a licence with conditions (NOC/c) for two additional uses: as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, and also for pain due to cancer.\n\nNabiximols is available in a number of countries as an unlicensed medicine, which enables doctors to prescribe the product to people who they consider may benefit. The product has been exported from the UK to a total of 28 countries to date.\n\nIn February 2007, GW and Otsuka Pharmaceutical announced an exclusive agreement for Otsuka to develop and market the drug in the United States. The first large scale US Phase IIb trial, Spray Trial, for people with cancer reported positive results in March 2010. GW and Otsuka have now commenced the Phase III development of nabiximols in cancer pain.\n\nIn December 2012, Sativex was approved in Poland.\n\nIn 2013, France legalized the use of cannabinoids in medicine, Sativex is the first one to be sold under prescription. Nevertheless, as of June 2016 this drug had still not actually been sold in pharmacies there.\n\nOf the two preliminary Phase III studies investigating the treatment of people with MS, one showed a reduction of spasticity of 1.2 points on the 0–10 points rating scale (versus 0.6 points under placebo), the other showed a reduction of 1.0 versus 0.8 points. Only the first study reached statistical significance. The Phase III approval study consisted of a run-in phase where the response of individuals to the drug was determined. The responders (42% of subjects) showed a significant effect in the second, placebo controlled, phase of the trial. A 2009 meta-analysis of six studies found large variations of effectiveness, with a – statistically non-significant – trend towards a reduction of spasticity. A systematic review in 2014 by the American Academy of Neurology found that nabiximols was 'probably effective' for spasticity, pain, and urinary dysfunction, but wasn't supported for tremor.\n\nNabiximols has also been studied for cancer pain resistant to opioids. Adjuvant use was safe and effective in 3 trials for cancer pain, however the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint for this purpose in its first Phase III trial.\n\nIn early clinical trials, nabiximols has generally been well tolerated. The most common adverse effects in Phase III trials were dizziness (25%), drowsiness (8%) and disorientation (4%); 12% of subjects stopped taking the drug because of the side effects. No investigations regarding the potential for dependence are available, but such a potential is unlikely considering the pharmacological properties of the two components.\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals were issued a unique license to cultivate cannabis for the manufacturing of Sativex in the UK, granting them the sole legal right to research in aerosolized cannabis derived therapeutics, which in April 2013 became commercially viable when the UK Government scheduled the Sativex formulation to part IV of the UK Drugs Act.\n\n\n"}

A synchronous function acts like a standard function in most Object-Oriented Language, upon invocation the function body is executed and a return value may or may not be returned to the caller. An asynchronous function acts similar to a function that returns void except that it is guaranteed to return immediately with the execution being done in a separate thread.\n"}

Born on his family's farm in Hammondsville, Ohio, he became one of the most prolific scorers in college basketball history during his career at Rio Grande College (now known as the University of Rio Grande), topping over 100 points on two occasions. Standing and known for his shooting touch, Francis held the NCAA record for points scored in a game from 1954–2012.\n\nIn 1951, during his senior year in high school in Wellsville, Ohio, Francis scored 776 points in 25 games for an average of nearly 32 points per game. In the process, he led his team to a 19–1 regular season record and a berth in the state playoffs. He was a unanimous all-state performer.\n\nIn 1953, Francis averaged 48.3 points a game, which is an NCAA record. He actually averaged 50.1 points per game over the season, but the NCAA excluded some of his best games because they were against lesser competition, such as junior colleges. One of the games that did not count in the official totals was a 116-point game against Ashland Junior College.\n\nIn 1954, Francis averaged 48.0 points a game. He scored a then-record 113 in a single game, eclipsed in 2012 by Grinnell's Jack Taylor's 138 points against Faith Baptist Bible. Francis still holds the top two scoring averages in NAIA history, along with many NCAA records.\n\nBevo Francis, teammate Al Schreiber, and his coach Newt Oliver later signed with the Boston Whirlwinds, a barnstorming team that played against the Harlem Globetrotters. He was subsequently drafted by Philadelphia of the NBA, but opted to return home to his wife and family.\n\nFrancis died on June 3, 2015, due to complications of esophageal cancer in Highlandtown, Ohio.

Later they were joined by a second guitarist, Ollie Hoon. Their first album, \"The Last Call\", spent seven weeks in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 31. Roper left the band in 1982, and Anti-Pasti effectively ended until reformations in both 1995 and 2012.\n\nFrom Derby, England, Anti-Pasti were part of the second wave of punk of the early 1980s. The group were formed from a local outfit called The Scrincers, and comprised Dugi Bell on guitar, Martin Roper on lead vocals, Russell Maw and Eddie Barke (aka Edmund Sonuga-Barke). Barke and Maw soon quit. Maw went on to play for The Allies, Aftermath UK and The Egyptian Kings. Barke went on to become a notable cognitive neuroscientist. With the addition of Stu Winfield on bass and Stan Smith on drums, they released their debut EP, \"Four Sore Points\", on their own Dose record label. They played many gigs in and around Derby, most notably The Cosmo Club and The Ajanta and soon built up a large local following supporting bands such as The Clash and U.K. Subs \n\nWinfield and Smith were then replaced by Kev Nixon and Will Hoon before the group signed to Rondelet Records and re-releasing the \"Four Sore Points EP\" followed by \"Let Them Free\" in January 1981. Later that year, Anti-Pasti released their debut album, \"The Last Call\", which reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart. Their growing profile was confirmed when a third single, \"Six Guns\", appeared at the end of the year and reached number 1 in the UK Indie Chart, as did the joint venture with The Exploited on a 12\" single EP, \"Don't Let 'Em Grind You Down\" which featured tracks \"Ain't Got Me\" and \"Another Dead Soldier\", both were recorded as part of The Wragby Studio Session Tapes in 1980. The latter spent one week at No. 70 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1981. \n\nIn 1981 also saw the band take part in the \"Apocalypse Now\" tour with fellow third wave punk bands The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chron Gen and The Anti Nowhere League. Winter 1981 saw Anti-Pasti tour America and Canada performing with Dead Kennedys, Naked Raygun and Flipper\n\n\"East to the West\", released in 1982, preceded the final Anti-Pasti album and single, both titled \"Caution in the Wind\", which featured Will Hoon's brother Ollie on guitar. A self-titled singles retrospective surfaced a year later, but the group split in 1984 following the firing of Roper. There was a reunion in 1995, leading to mini-tours of the UK and (Germany).\n\nAfter years working in the retail trade, Roper currently runs Real Ale Tours of Derby, and has various food related business interests. Bell has a financial interest in the Golddigga fashion chain.\n\nThe band reformed in 2012, with a line up of Martin Roper (vocals), Ollie Hoon (lead guitar), Kev Nixon (drums) and new member Ben Hanson (bass). The first concert back after a 17-year absence was a warm up gig at The Horn at St. Albans on 31 July 2012, they then performed three days later as special guests at the Rebellion Festival. The third gig they played was at the 1st Annual Punk Gig at London's 229, along with Ruts DC, Glen Matlock and the Philistines, Discharge (band), The Business (band), Vice Squad, and Infa-Riot amongst others. \n\nDuring 2012 the band has also written and performed two new songs live \"Viva Che\" and \"I See Red\", which have been demoed along with re-workings of old songs \"Last Train to Nowhere\" and \"Burn in Your Own Flames\". A press statement said that the band would soon be releasing a four track EP; however, in January 2014 it was announced that Roper had decided to leave the band to pursue \ninterests outside the music business. As of February 2014 Anti Pasti announced a new vocalist in the form of Gez Addictive and their intention to be playing material old and new at some of the pre Spannered Festival shows\n\nThis line-up played various festivals around the U.K and Europe, including Rebellion and Pod Parou; as well as mini tours on the continent, most notably Germany.\n\nThe band continued to write new material and finally, 34 years since their last studio album was released, laid down tracks for an upcoming album. The album was to be released in August 2016 and the band were asked to feature on the 20th anniversary of Rebellion Festival alongside other UK82 contemporary's such as The Exploited, Discharge, Chron Gen, Vice Squad and the Anti Nowhere League, however with the album set for release and shows arranged to promote it Gez was fired from the band. The Rebellion show was cancelled as were other festival and U.K dates.\n\nIn August the album \"Rise Up\" was finally released to great reviews, and original member and lead singer Martin Roper agreed to fulfil gigs arranged in Antwerp and Paris; this however (because of Roper's work commitments) was agreed as a temporary measure. In the summer of 2017 vocal duties were assumed by Chron Gens Glynn Barber who split duties between the two bands. Following Barber's departure from the line-up Micky Bones briefly became the front man before the band decided to become a trio with bassist Ben Hanson becoming permanent lead vocalist. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These finds include the world's largest, the Welcome Stranger, which was discovered in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates.\n\nFrom what was once a thriving goldfields town, Moliagul today is a virtual ghost town and consists of a number of scattered houses. In 1855 it is estimated there were 16,000 people living in the immediate area during the peak of the Victorian gold rush period.

On 1 January 2016, it became part of the new administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It comprised three departments: Corrèze, Creuse, and Haute-Vienne.\n\nSituated mostly in the west side of south-central French Massif Central, Limousin had (in 2010) 742,770 inhabitants spread out on nearly 17,000 km², making it the least populated region of metropolitan France.\n\nForming part of the southwest of the country, Limousin is bordered by the regions of Centre-Val de Loire to the north, Auvergne to the east, Midi-Pyrénées to the south, Aquitaine to the southwest, and Poitou-Charentes to the west. Limousin is also part of the larger historical Occitania region.\n\nThe modern region of Limousin is essentially composed of two historical French provinces:\n\nBeside these two main provinces, Limousin is also composed of small parts of other former provinces:\n\nToday the province of Limousin is the most populous part of the Limousin region. Limoges, the historical capital and largest city of the province of Limousin, is the capital of the Limousin administrative region.\n\nWith a slowly rising population of just under 750,000, Limousin is the second-least populous region in Metropolitan France after Corsica.\n\nThe population of Limousin is aging and, until 1999, was declining. The department of Creuse has the oldest population of any in France. Between 1999 and 2004 the population of Limousin increased slightly, reversing a decline for the first time in decades.\n\n\nLimousin is an essentially rural region. Famed for some of the best beef farming in the world, herds of Limousin cattle—a distinctive chestnut red—are a common sight in the region. The region is also a major timber producing area.\n\nDue to its rural locality, it is also famed for its groves of French Oak, so prized for its distinct characters and flavors in wine fermentation that vintner Rémy Martin has exclusive rights to its oak groves. It is a partnership that is over 100 years old.\n\nThe regional capital, Limoges, was once an industrial power base, world-renowned for its porcelain and still a leader and innovator in electric equipment factories (which originally used porcelain as an insulator). However, large factories are now few in number. Limousin is the poorest region in Metropolitan France; only the overseas collectivities have a lower GDP per capita.\n\nSome of the rivers belonging to the Loire basin run through the north, west and east of the region, waterways belonging to that of the Dordogne through the south. The region is crossed by three major rivers: the Vienne, the Dordogne and the Charente (which has its source in Haute-Vienne). The region is well known for the high quality of its water and for offering first-rate fishing.\n\nThe Limousin region is almost entirely an upland area. The lowest land is in the northwest of the region (approximately 250 m above sea level) and the highest land is roughly in the southeast (approximately 1000 m above sea level). However, the greater part of the region is above 350 m.\n\nLimousin is one of the traditional provinces of France. Its name derives from that of a Celtic tribe, the Lemovices, who had their capital at Saint-Denis-des-Murs and whose main sanctuary was recently found in Tintignac, a site which became a major site for Celtic studies thanks to unique objects which were found - such as the carnyces, unique in the whole Celtic world.\n\nViscount Aimar V of Limoges ( – ) was a notable ruler of the region.\n\nUntil the 1970s, Occitan was the primary language of rural areas. There remain several different Occitan dialects in use in Limousin, although their use is rapidly declining. These are:\n\n\"Pâté aux pommes de terre\" is one of the specialties of Limousin, as well as of the neighbouring department of Allier. Clafoutis is a local dessert.\n\nPerhaps due to its rural character, Limousin has maintained a strong tradition of traditional music, with ancient instruments such as the bagpipe (called \"chabrette\", \"Chabreta\" in occitan) and hurdy-gurdy remaining popular.\n\n\n"}

Jackson\n\nJonathan Peter Jackson (June 23, 1953 – August 7, 1970), was a self-proclaimed revolutionary who died of gunshot wounds suffered during his armed invasion of a California courthouse. At age 17, Jackson stormed the Marin County Courthose with automatic weapons, kidnapping Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, prosecutor Gary Thomas, and three jurors. Escaping with the hostages, Jackson demanded the Soledad Brothers' immediate release from prison. The Soledad Brothers, a group of African American inmates facing charges for allegedly throwing a white prison guard to his death at San Quentin, included Jackson's elder brother George Jackson. None of the Soledad defendants were at the courthouse on the day of the attack.\n\nIn an ensuing shootout, Jackson and Judge Haley were killed, along with two inmates already in the courtroom, who had readily joined the attack; prosecutor Thomas was paralyzed and one juror was seriously injured. The guns that Jackson used were registered to political activist Angela Davis, who previously formed a committee supporting the Soledad Brothers. Davis stood trial for alleged involvement in the kidnapping and was acquitted of all charges in June 1972.\n\nJackson was the youngest of five children born to Lester and Georgia Bea Jackson. Raised in Pasadena, California, he attended St Andrew's School from 1965-67 for grades seven and eight, La Salle High School for ninth grade (1967–68), and then Blair High School through his junior year.\n\nGeorge Jackson includes passages in his 1971 book, \"Blood in My Eye,\" which he attributes to his brother Jonathan. These passages figure prominently in the development of the elder Jackson's theory of revolutionary praxis.\n\nJackson had occasionally worked as a bodyguard for political activist and Black Panther member Angela Davis. Davis would later endorse the \"spirit\" of Jackson.\n\nOn August 7, 1970, Jackson brought a satchel containing three automatic firearms, registered to Davis, into the Marin County Hall of Justice, where Judge Haley was presiding over the trial of San Quentin inmate James McClain. \n\nOnce inside Judge Haley's courtroom, Jackson drew an automatic gun, and, aided by McClain and Black Panther inmates Ruchell Cinque Magee and William Arthur Christmas, took Judge Haley as well as Deputy District Attorney Gary Thomas and three female jurors hostage. \n\nJackson and the other kidnappers bound the hostages with piano wire and used psychological torture to enforce compliance. The militants proudly encouraged responding journalists to document their actions as they loaded the hostages into a rented van, with the intent of transporting them to a nearby radio station where they would demand that the Soledad Brothers be released, contrary to their lawful detainment under court order. Responding police fired on the van that Jackson was driving in an attempt to end the attack. During the shootout, Jonathan Jackson, Christmas, McClain, and Judge Haley were killed, while Magee and Deputy District Attorney Thomas were seriously injured.\n\nJackson's son, Jonathan Jackson Jr., was born eight and a half months after his father's death. A monument on the premises to Judge Haley was the target of a follow-up attack perpetrated by the Weather Underground terrorist network in October of the same year.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked in the advertising department of Procter and Gamble, in Cincinnati, Ohio, before being conscripted into the US Army. While serving in the public affairs office of the Allied Headquarters in Paris, from 1953 to 1955, he met Dominique Lapierre with whom he would write several best-sellers over 43 years.\n\nHe went back to Procter and Gamble and became the products manager of the new foods division in 1955. Disillusioned with commerce, he took to journalism and joined the Paris bureau of United Press International in 1956, and became the news editor in Rome in the following year, and later the MidEast bureau chief in Beirut.\n\nIn 1959, he joined Newsweek as Middle East editor, based in New York City. He became the Paris bureau chief in 1961, where he would work until 1964, until he switched to writing books.\n\nIn 1965, Collins and Dominique Lapierre published their first joint work, \"Is Paris Burning?\" (in French \"Paris brûle-t-il?\"), a tale of Nazi occupation of the French capital during World War II and Hitler's plans to destroy Paris should it fall into the hands of the Allies. The book was an instant success and was made into a movie in 1966 by director René Clément, starring Kirk Douglas, Glenn Ford and Alain Delon.\n\nIn 1967, they co-authored \"Or I'll Dress you in Mourning\" about the Spanish bullfighter Manuel Benítez El Cordobés.\n\nIn 1972, after five years' research and interviews, they published \"O Jerusalem!\" about the birth of Israel in 1948, turned into a movie by Elie Chouraqui.\n\nIn 1975, they published \"Freedom at Midnight\", a story of the Indian Independence in 1947, and the subsequent assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. It is said they spent $300,000 researching and still emerged wealthy.\n\nThe duo published their first fictional work, \"The Fifth Horseman\", in 1981. It describes a terrorist attack on New York masterminded by Libya's Colonel Gaddafi. The book had such a shocking effect that the French President cancelled the sale of nuclear reactors to Libya, even though it was meant for peaceful purposes. Paramount Pictures, which was planning a film based on the book, dropped the idea in fear that fanatics would emulate the scenario in real life.\n\nIn 1985, Collins authored \"Fall from Grace\" (without Lapierre) about a woman agent sent into occupied France who realizes she may be betrayed by her British masters if necessary. He also wrote \"Maze: A Novel\" (1989), and \"Black Eagles\" (1992), a semi-fictional novel about two conflicted American agents in Manuel Noreiga´s Panama. He also wrote \"Le Jour Du Miracle: D-Day Paris\" (1994) and \"Tomorrow Belongs To Us\" (1998). Shortly before his death, he collaborated with Lapierre on \"Is New York Burning?\" (2005), a novel mixing fictional characters and real-life figures that speculates about a terrorist attack on New York City.\n\nIn 2005, while working from his home in Fréjus, France, on a book about the Middle East, Collins died of a sudden cerebral haemorrhage.\n\nIn 1966, Collins married Nadia Sultan.

It was the tenth race of the 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 70-lap race was won from pole position by Fernando Alonso, driving a Renault, with Drivers' Championship rival Kimi Räikkönen finishing second in a McLaren-Mercedes and Michael Schumacher third in a Ferrari.\n\nThe French Grand Prix was the tenth race of the 2005 season and after the controversial United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis two weeks previously, Formula One returned to Europe for the busiest month in its 56-year history, with Magny-Cours being the first of four races to be held in the five weekends of July.\n\nAt the start of the weekend, McLaren and Renault appeared to be the fastest teams, topping the time sheets for both practice sessions on Friday. However, Kimi Räikkönen suffered an engine failure, using a new-spec Mercedes V10, and was forced to drop ten grid positions as a result. Renault set the two fastest times in Saturday practice 1 by over one second, but only nine cars ran in the session. Giancarlo Fisichella was quickest in the final practice session before qualifying, with Räikkönen was close behind.\n\nThe qualifying session ran in markedly cool conditions than expected but the Michelin tyres still had the advantage over the Bridgestones. Fernando Alonso scored his second consecutive pole position, with Toyota's Jarno Trulli alongside him on the front row. Räikkönen's penalty dropped him from third to 13th, thus promoting Michael Schumacher in the Ferrari to third. The Saubers of Felipe Massa and Jacques Villeneuve were 10th and 11th respectively (subsequently promoted to 9th and 10th), while Williams, who had struggled all weekend despite several new aerodynamic updates to the car, were 13th and 14th. The Jordans and Minardis filled the back two rows. The session was incredibly close as the top nine drivers were covered by less than a second.\n\nThe start of the race saw Alonso speed away quickly, leaving Trulli to fend off Michael Schumacher through the first few corners, while Rubens Barrichello leap-frogged Takuma Sato into fourth place. Räikkönen was able to pass both Mark Webber and Ralf Schumacher to move into 11th position by the end of the first lap. By the second lap, Alonso had extended his lead to nearly three seconds, while Räikkönen moved up another position to tenth by passing Villeneuve. Red Bull's Christian Klien became the first retirement of the race on lap 2 due to a lack of fuel pressure. Alonso continued pulling away from the pack setting consecutive fastest laps.\nBarrichello was the first of the front-runners to stop; from fourth position. The following lap both Trulli and Michael Schumacher pitted allowing Schumacher to emerge ahead having been stuck behind Trulli's Toyota since the beginning. Alonso finally pitted on lap 20 while leading by nearly 30 seconds allowing him to rejoin without losing a position. The pitstop sequence allowed the two long-running McLarens into 2nd and 3rd positions with Juan Pablo Montoya ahead of Räikkönen. Both McLaren drivers continued their first stints before Montoya pitted on lap 25 rejoining ahead of Michael Schumacher to take third. Räikkönen stayed out for three more laps and finally pitted on lap 28. Those laps did make the difference and he came out ahead of Montoya.\n\nPatrick Friesacher became the second retirement when he stopped on lap 34. On lap 37, Christijan Albers crashed his Minardi heavily after spinning in turn 2. Alonso stopped for the second time on lap 41 rejoining with a 14-second margin to the second-placed Räikkönen. Meanwhile, Montoya began to struggle and ultimately retired from third position on lap 46 with a hydraulics failure. This allowed Michael Schumacher to move into the final podium position, which he held after his final pitstop on lap 51. Williams' dismal day continued as Nick Heidfeld pitted complaining that his car was impossible to drive. With all but the top four cars lapped, Sato ran wide briefly into the gravel at Estoril corner, which cost him 10th position to David Coulthard. Fisichella stalled as he attempted to leave his pit box on lap 58. Renault mechanics had to restart his engine costing him two valuable positions.\n\nWith eight laps remaining, Alonso lapped fourth-placed Jenson Button, leaving only the top three drivers on the lead lap. Alonso crossed the finish line to take his fifth and Renault's sixth win of the season. Räikkönen finished 11.8 seconds behind Alonso, ensuring that the gap in the championship standings increased by only two points, while Michael Schumacher picked up a timely podium for Ferrari, allowing him to stay in the championship hunt as well. Button came in fourth to score BAR's first points of the year, with Trulli, Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve completing the top eight.\n\nThe bottom six teams in the 2004 Constructors' Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\n\nThis was the last appearance for Olivier Panis.\n\n† Kimi Räikkönen received a 10 position grid penalty for an engine change on Friday.\n\n"}

The series is based on the \"Dangerous Davies\" series of novels written by Leslie Thomas, and was filmed in the north London suburbs of Willesden, Neasden and Harlesden. The gentle but engrossing nature of the series was in stark contrast to other hard-hitting police dramas of the time, but this appeared to be a winning formula, becoming a surprise rating success.\n\nThe first series aired in 2003, with three more series following it. The first, second and third series all consist of four 70-minute episodes (90-minutes with advertisements). The fourth series saw the format change to 90-minute episodes (120-minutes with advertisements), and is slightly longer, encompassing five episodes in the series. After a total of seventeen episodes, production company Meridian Broadcasting (later Granada Productions), who produced the programme, stated that the series had been axed due to falling viewing figures, and that the fourth series would be the last.\n\nThe Granada series was not the first time that the title character had appeared on television. He previously appeared in a TV movie, first broadcast on 4 January 1981, starring Bernard Cribbins.\n\nThe series follows Detective Constable \"Dangerous\" Davies. Davies discovered a crime committed by a fellow officer at the opening of the series, and is treated as a pariah by his colleagues as a consequence. Moreover, he is committed to his work and is staunchly humane, leading to a view of his being soft by colleagues, and a degree of grudging respect from local criminals. Recurring themes include Davies solving the apparently minor crimes he is given, often resolving more complex and associated crimes (historical or contemporary), and Davies repeatedly being the target of practical jokes by younger but more well positioned detectives in his unit.\n\nAs the series progresses his reputation improves with his superior, Detective Inspector (DI) Aspinall, who realises that Davies' intelligence and fair but determined methods make him the best policeman in his squad. A strained mutual respect develops between the two characters as Davies increasingly finds the time to try to understand the troubled, hard drinking DI and his history (and demons).\n\nThe other major aspect of the series concerns Davies' private life, which centres on his estranged wife, Julie (played by Emma Amos). The storyline regularly integrates Davies' attempts to address the loss of his wife's respect and to repair the damage done to their marriage after his career stalls in the Metropolitan Police Force; for instance, the estranged character returns to pick up a dog whose custody he shares with Julie (see below), to serve as her occasional chauffeur, and to carry out routine household maintenance at the family home (occasionally intersecting with Julie's new relationship interests).\n\nHis work and personal life intertwine in interactions with his friend, the irreverent and rather feckless Mod (short for Modesty) Lewis, played by the Irish comedian Sean Hughes, which include their park bench talks about cases and life, Davies' chauffeuring the unlicensed Mod, and Davies' walking his dog—an unnamed, but consistent character, a Landseer in early episodes, and later a St Bernard. Other recurring plot elements are the now \"semi-detached\" Davies' interactions with various female characters, episode by episode, and his relationship with Mrs Fulljames (Elizabeth Bennett), the romantic daydreaming landlady of the Bali-Hai Guest House, where he resides for a period.\n\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n\"The Last Detective: Complete Collection\" was released on Region 1 DVD on 20 January 2009 and includes all 17 episodes of the TV show, the earlier TV movie, and other features including an interview with Peter Davison.\nThe DVD set is distributed by Acorn Media UK.\n\n\n"}

Stafford is best known for providing the voice of Woody Woodpecker, a creation of Lantz's, from 1950 to 1991.\n\nGrace appeared in feature live-action films from 1935's \"Dr. Socrates\" to 1975's \"\". Some of her more notable roles were in the films \"Anthony Adverse\" and \"Blossoms in the Dust\".\n\nAround the time the Woody Woodpecker short \"Drooler's Delight\" was in production, Mel Blanc, who had originally supplied Woody's voice and laugh, filed a lawsuit against producer Walter Lantz, claiming that Lantz had used his voice in later cartoons without permission. The judge, however, ruled for Lantz, saying that Blanc had failed to copyright his voice or his contributions. Though Lantz won the case, he paid Blanc in an out-of-court settlement when Blanc filed an appeal. Wanting to avoid any future retaliation from voice artists wanting to sue him, Lantz opted to find a new voice actor to replace Ben Hardaway as Woody's talking voice, as well as a definitive version of the laugh for his star woodpecker.\n\nIn 1950, Lantz held anonymous auditions. Stafford offered to do Woody's voice, but Lantz turned her down because Woody was a male character. Not discouraged in the least, Grace made her own anonymous audition tape and submitted it to the studio. Not knowing who was behind the voice he heard, Lantz picked Grace's voice for Woody Woodpecker. Stafford provided Woody's voice from 1950 to 1991. At first, she asked not to be credited in the role, as she believed that audiences both young and old would be \"disillusioned\" if they knew Woody was voiced by a woman. But she soon came to enjoy being known as Woody's voice and, starting with 1958's \"Misguided Missile\", finally allowed her name to be credited on screen.\n\nStafford also appeared on an episode of \"What's My Line?\" on November 10, 1963.\n\nGracie Lantz died of spinal cancer on March 17, 1992, at the age nearly 89.\n\n"}
{"id": "2079605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079605", "title": "Country of origin", "text": "Country of origin\n\nCountry of origin (COO), represents the country or countries of manufacture, production, design, or brand origin where an article or product comes from . For multinational brands, COO may include multiple countries within the value-creation process.\n\nThere are differing rules of origin under various national laws and international treaties. Country of origin labelling is also known as \"place-based branding\", the \"made-in image\" or the \"nationality bias.\" In some regions or industries, country of origin labelling may adopt unique local terms such as terroir used to describe wine appellations based on the specific region where grapes are grown and wine manufactured.\n\nPlace-based branding has a very ancient history. Archaeological evidence points to packaging specifying the place of manufacture dating back to some 4,000 years ago. Over time, informal labels evolved into formal, often regulated labels providing consumers with information about product quality, manufacturer name and place of origin.\n\nCountry of origin of a product can have several possible definitions. It can refer to:\n\nThe inclusion of place of origin on manufactured goods has an ancient history. In antiquity, informal branding which included details such as the name of manufacturer and place of origin were used by consumers as important clues as to product quality. David Wengrow has found archaeological evidence of brands, which often included origin of manufacture, dating to around 4,000 years ago. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus providing information about the product and its quality. For instance, an object found in a royal burial tomb in Abydos (southern Egypt) and dating to around 3,000 B.C.E., carries brand elements that would be very familiar to modern consumers. Inscriptions on the surface denote a specific place of manufacture, \"finest oil of Tjehenu,\" a region in modern-day Libya.\n\nIn China, place-names appear to have developed independently during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-AD 200); brand names and place names were relatively commonplace on goods. Eckhardt and Bengtsson have argued that in the absence of a capitalist system, branding was connected to social systems and cultural contexts; that brand development was a consumer-initiated activity rather than the manufacturer-push normally associated with Western brand management practices.\n\nDiana Twede has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for purchasers during exchange. Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings functioned as a brand, conveying information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to function as signs of product quality.\n\nThe Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places, such as oysters from Londinium and cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the Middle East. In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as \"Lassius\" and \"L. Eumachius;\" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name.\n\nUmbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as garum) in Pompeii c. 35 C.E., was branding his amphora which travelled across the entire Mediterranean. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:\nScauras' fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.\nDuring the Medieval period in Europe, numerous market towns sprang up and competition between them intensified. In response to competitive pressures, towns began investing in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors. By the thirteenth century, English counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as \"Bristol red\", Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses. Casson and Lee have argued that the chartered markets of England and Europe in medieval times were using the regional market's reputation as a sign of produce quality and that this acted as an early form of branding.\n\nFollowing the European age of expansion, goods were imported from afar. Marco Polo, for example, wrote about silk from China and spices from India. Consumers began to associate specific countries with merchandise - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.\n\nBy the late 19th century, European countries began introducing country of origin labelling legislation. In the 20th century, as markets became more global and trade barriers removed, consumers had access to a broader range of goods from almost anywhere in the world. Country of origin is an important consideration in purchase decision-making.\n\nThe effects of country of origin labeling on consumer purchasing have been extensively studied. The country of origin effect is also known as the \"made-in image\" and the \"nationality bias.\"\n\nResearch shows that consumers' broad general perceptions of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country or countries, as occurs for multinational brands .\n\nFor example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant of whether or not someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who do not know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for \"low involvement\" product categories such as shampoo and candy. In various studies it has also been proven that the Country-of-Origin Effect also applies to services.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that consumers tend to have a relative preference to products from their own country or may have a relative preference for or aversion against products that originate from certain countries (so-called affinity and animosity countries).\n\nThe requirements for Country of Origin markings are complicated by the various designations which may be required such as \"Made in X\", \"Product of X\", \"Manufactured in X\" etc. They also vary by country of import and export. For example:\n\n\nSection 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended () requires most imports, including many food items, to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of their country of origin. Meats, produce, and several other raw agricultural products generally were exempt. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10816), however, contains a requirement that many retail establishments provide, starting on September 30, 2004, country-of-origin information on fresh fruits and vegetables, red meats, seafood, and peanuts. However, the consolidated FY2004 appropriation (P.L. 108-199) signed January 23, 2004, delayed this requirement for two years except for seafood.\n\nThe Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and Wool Products Labeling Act require a Made in USA label on clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing.\n\nOn a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck, either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product.\n\nCatalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported, or both.\n\nThe Fur Products Labeling Act requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising.\n\nThe American Automobile Labeling Act requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission’s policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission’s standard.\n\nThe Buy American Act requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes. For more information, review the Buy American Act at 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a-10c, the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 C.F.R. Part 25, and the Trade Agreements Act at 19 U.S.C. §§ 2501-2582.\n\nThe Lanham Act gives any person (such as a competitor) who is damaged by a false designation of origin the right to sue the party making the false claim.\n\n\nCompanies may indicate the origin of their products with a number of different marketing strategies:\n\n\nWhen shipping products from one country to another, the products may have to be marked with country of origin, and the country of origin will generally be required to be indicated in the export/import documents and governmental submissions. Country of origin will affect its admissibility, the rate of duty, its entitlement to special duty or trade preference programs, antidumping, and government procurement.\n\nToday, many products are an outcome of a large number of parts and pieces that come from many different countries, and that may then be assembled together in a third country. In these cases, it's hard to know exactly what is the country of origin, and different rules apply as to how to determine their \"correct\" country of origin. Generally, articles only change their country of origin if the work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation, or, the article changes its name, tariff code, character or use (for instance from wheel to car). Value added in the second country may also be an issue.\n\nIn principle, the \"substantial transformation\" of a product is intended as a change in the harmonized system coding. For example, a rough commodity sold from country \"A\" to country \"B\", than subjected of a transformation in country \"B\", which sells the final processed commodity to a country \"C\" is considered a sufficient step to label the end product \"made in B\".\n\nThe International Federation of Film Archives defines the country of origin as the \"country of the principal offices of the production company or individual by whom the moving image work was made\". No consistent reference or definition exists. Sources include the item itself, accompanying material (e.g. scripts, shot lists, production records, publicity material, inventory lists, synopses etc.), the container (if not an integral part of the piece), or other sources (standard and special moving image reference tools). In law, definitions of \"country of origin\" and related terms are defined differently in different jurisdictions. The European Union, Canada, and the United States have different definitions for a variety of reasons, including tax treatment, advertising regulations, distribution; even within the European Union, different member states have different legislation. As a result, an individual work can have multiple countries as its \"country of origin\", and may even have different countries recognized as originating places for the purpose of different legal jurisdictions. Under copyright law in the United States and other signatories of the Berne Convention, \"country of origin\" is defined in an inclusive way to ensure the protection of intellectual rights of writers and creators.\n\n\n"}

UK), is a consumer magazine and digital publisher in the United Kingdom, with a portfolio selling over 350 million copies each year. It is owned by a fund affiliated with British private equity firm Epiris.\n\nThe British magazine publishing industry in the mid-1950s was dominated by a handful of companies, principally the Associated Newspapers (founded by Lord Harmsworth in 1890), Odhams Press Ltd, George Newnes Publishers, C. Arthur Pearson, and the Hulton Press, which fought each other for market share in a highly competitive marketplace.\n\nIn 1958 Cecil Harmsworth King, chairman of the newspaper group, The Daily Mirror Newspapers Limited which included the \"Daily Mirror\" and the \"Sunday Pictorial\" (now the \"Sunday Mirror\"), together with provincial chain West of England Newspapers, made an offer for Amalgamated Press. The offer was accepted, and in January 1959 he was appointed its chairman. Within a few months he changed its name to Fleetway Publications, Ltd. after the name of its headquarters, Fleetway House in London's Farringdon Street.\n\nShortly thereafter, Odhams Press absorbed both George Newnes and the Hulton Press. King saw an opportunity in this to rationalise the overcrowded women's magazine market, in which Fleetway and Newnes were the major competitors, and made a bid for Odhams on behalf of Fleetway that was too attractive to ignore. Fleetway took over Odhams in March 1961.\n\nIn consequence, King controlled publishing interests which included two national daily and two national Sunday newspapers (the newspaper interests being informally tagged The Mirror Group), along with almost one hundred consumer magazines, more than two hundred trade and technical periodicals, and interests in book publishing. This included the combined business interests of Fleetway, Odhams, and Newnes.\n\nAll of the companies involved had been acquired without any significant change in management, save for the appointment of Mirror Group directors as chairmen. In 1963 all the companies were combined by the creation of a parent (or \"holding\") company called the International Publishing Corporation (known informally as IPC). All of the existing companies would continue to exist, but as IPC subsidiaries.\n\nIPC then set up a management development department in 1965, to rationalise its holdings, so that its various subsidiaries would no longer be in competition with each other for the same markets. This led to a reorganisation of the Group, in 1968, into six divisions:\n\n\nAll the divisions were headed by chairmen who originated in Mirror Group, except for Hamlyn, Quick and McIntosh.\n\nAlso in 1968, a boardroom coup replaced Cecil King with his deputy chairman, Hugh Cudlipp, a former newspaper editor.\n\nCudlipp had no interest in management, and was uneasy both with his new role and with IPC's diversification into computerised publication and other new technology. In 1969 he therefore proposed to former Mirror Group director Don Ryder, who was then chairman of the Reed Group, in which IPC had a 30% shareholding, to mount a reverse take-over of IPC by Reed.\n\nIPC-Mirror Group was thus itself taken over in 1970, by the paper-making company Albert E Reed, which then renamed itself Reed International. In 1974, part of the publishing interests of Reed International were separated into \"IPC Magazines Ltd\" (comprising the magazine and comics holdings) and Mirror Group Newspapers (comprising the newspaper holdings). The latter was sold to Pergamon Holdings Ltd, a private company owned by Robert Maxwell, in 1984.\n\nIn 1988, IPC acquired \"Family Circle\" from the International Thomson Organization. In 1989, IPC acquired \"TVTimes\". In the early 1990s IPC launched \"Loaded\", which began a wave of \"lad's mags\".\n\nIn 1992, following a merger with Dutch science publisher Elsevier NV, Reed International underwent a further name change, becoming Reed Elsevier (now RELX Group).\n\nIn 1987, part of the comics holdings of IPC Magazines Ltd (comprising those comics and characters created after 1 January 1970, plus 26 specified characters from \"Buster\", which was then still being published) were placed in a separate company, Fleetway Publications, which was sold to Pergamon Holdings.\n\nIn 1991, Egmont UK purchased Fleetway from Pergamon, merging it with their own comics publishing operation, London Editions, to form Fleetway Editions. The latter was absorbed into the main Egmont brand by 2000, having sold off the continuing titles (such as \"2000 AD\"), and continued with only reprint and licensed titles (e.g. \"Sonic The Comic\"). IPC had retained the other comics characters and titles, i.e. those created before 1970 (except the 26 characters from \"Buster\"), including Sexton Blake, The Steel Claw, and Battler Britton. One character, Dan Dare, was sold separately and is currently owned by the Dan Dare Corporation. In August 2016, Egmont sold its remaining library of IPC/Fleetway to Rebellion Developments, who had previously acquired \"2000 AD\" in 2000.\n\nIn 1998, IPC Magazines Ltd was subject to a management buyout financed by Cinven, a venture capital group, and the company was renamed IPC Media. Cinven then sold the company to Time Inc., then the magazine publishing subsidiary of Time Warner, in 2001. In January 2009, the company's chief executive became Evelyn Webster, replacing Sylvia Auton who had run it since 2001.\n\nIPC Media formally became Time Inc. UK in September 2014, creating a single Time Inc. brand in both the US and UK.\n\nIn April 2012, IPC Media won an award for Best Production Team of the Year at the Professional Publishers Association Production and Environment Awards 2012.\n\nOn 26 February 2018, Meredith Corporation, who had completed its purchase of Time Inc. almost a month earlier, announced it was selling Time Inc. UK to a fund associated with British private equity firm Epiris. The transaction closed on 19 March of that year. In June 2018, the company was renamed TI Media. In September of 2018, TI Media sold its library of pre-1970 IPC Comics titles to Rebellion Developments.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 18, 1996. In the episode, Lisa writes an essay on founder Jebediah Springfield for the town's bicentennial. While doing research, she learns he was a murderous pirate who viewed the town's citizens with contempt. Lisa and Homer try to reveal the truth about Jebediah but only anger Springfield's residents.\n\nThe episode was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Mike B. Anderson. It was Anderson's first directing role and the story was inspired by the 1991 exhumation of President Zachary Taylor. Donald Sutherland guest starred as the voice of Hollis Hurlbut, a part that was written specifically for him. The episode includes several references to Colonial and Revolutionary America, including Gilbert Stuart's unfinished 1796 painting of George Washington. \n\nThe episode features two neologisms, \"embiggen\" and \"cromulent\", which were intended to sound like real words but are in fact completely fabricated (although it was later discovered that C. A. Ward had used \"embiggen\" in 1884). \"Embiggen\", coined by Dan Greaney, has since been used in several scientific publications, while \"cromulent\", coined by David X. Cohen, appeared in Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon. \n\nThe episode was acclaimed by critics.\n\nAs Springfield celebrates its bicentennial, Miss Hoover assigns Lisa's second-grade class essays on Jebediah Springfield, the town's founder. Lisa visits the historical society to research Jebediah's life. While playing his fife, she discovers he was actually a villainous pirate known as Hans Sprungfeld until 1796. After trying to kill George Washington, he wrote his confession on the back of Washington's portrait and hid it in his fife, thinking the \"half-wits\" of Springfield would never find it.\n\nMayor Quimby proclaims Homer the town crier during tryouts for historical figures in the town's upcoming celebration. Because his \"criering\" is better than Flanders', Homer seizes Ned's heirloom hat and bell as props. Homer is later stripped of his \"criering\" outfit and duties when Quimby is offended by Lisa's attempts to correct the historical record about Jebediah Springfield.\n\nLisa tries to convince the town her claims are true but is met with disbelief and outright hostility. When she shows the confession to Hollis Hurlbut, the museum curator, he dismisses it as an obvious forgery. Miss Hoover gives Lisa an F for her essay, which she derides as \"dead white male bashing by a PC thug\".\n\nLisa conducts more research on Jebediah and discovers he had a prosthetic silver tongue. She persuades the municipal government to exhume his body to search for it. When the coffin is opened, his skeleton contains no silver tongue. After seeing the incomplete portrait of George Washington in her classroom, Lisa realizes the piece of paper containing the confession is the bottom half of the portrait. She confronts Hurlbut, who admits that he stole the silver tongue and hid it in the museum. Hurlbut explains that he did this to protect his career and the myth of Jebediah Springfield.\n\nAfter realizing it is wrong to idealize and celebrate a pirate, Lisa and Hollis decide to reveal the true story of Jebediah's life. As Lisa is about to share the truth with the parading townspeople, she realizes that Jebediah Springfield's myth inspires them. She decides to keep the truth a secret.\n\nThe story was inspired by the real events surrounding the exhumation of President Zachary Taylor. In the late 1980s, college professor and author Clara Rising theorized that Taylor was murdered by poison and was able to convince Taylor's closest living relative and the Coroner of Jefferson County, Kentucky, to order an exhumation. On June 17, 1991, Taylor's remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner, who found that the level of arsenic was much smaller than would be expected if Taylor had been thus poisoned. The remains were then returned to the cemetery and received appropriate honors at reinterment. Then-show runner Bill Oakley said \"Lisa the Iconoclast\" is \"essentially the same\" story but with Lisa in the role as Rising. At the end of the episode, an ode to Jebediah Springfield is played over the credits. The music and lyrics were written by Jeff Martin.\n\nDonald Sutherland voiced the historian in this episode. The script was specifically written with him in mind playing that part. Sutherland wanted to do the voice recordings as one would do a film and start in the middle of the script, so that he could get to know the character, but that idea was abandoned. In the episode, Lisa joked she was getting over her \"Chester A. Arthuritis\", a play on the word \"arthritis\" and the name of Chester A. Arthur. Sutherland ad-libbed the line \"you had arthritis?\", and the producers liked it so much that they kept it.\n\nThe episode opens with an old documentary on Jebediah Springfield, starring Troy McClure as Springfield. The writers tried to make this documentary seem as lousy and low-budget as possible. One of these tricks was to have post-production add scratches to the animation. The animators added production errors that would occur in a low-budget film. For example, a man in the crowd looks at the camera, some of the people are wearing wristwatches, McClure's stuntman does not have the same sideburns as he does, and a boom microphone can be seen entering the frame. In the Historical Society, the animators spent a significant amount of time decorating the walls. Besides numerous historical references, they also decorated the walls with \"The Simpsons\" characters in 18th-century settings. The first painting shows Otto Mann driving children in a horse-drawn carriage. Another painting shows Marge Simpson in silhouette. The last painting shows Professor Frink holding a kite in the manner of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nThe Historical Society of Springfield contains references to historical figures and facts. The episode features Gilbert Stuart's unfinished 1796 painting of George Washington and tells a fictional backstory of how it came to be. In reality, the painting was unfinished and it did not have a part torn off. Hurlbut mentions the American revolutionaries William Dawes and Samuel Allyne Otis as equals to Jebediah Springfield. When Lisa passes out the \"Wanted for treason\" posters, it is a reference to those featuring John F. Kennedy, which were circulated in Dallas prior to his assassination. Hurlbut claims Springfield's confessions are \"just as fake\" as the will of Howard Hughes and the diaries of Adolf Hitler, both of which are proven forgeries. The opening couch gag shows the Simpson family in blue boxes similar to the style of \"The Brady Bunch\".\nChief Wiggum is singing \"Camptown Races\" from 1850 by Stephen Foster ventriloquised with the skull of Jebediah Springfield. Lisa's dream in which Washington and Springfield are fighting is a reference to \"Lethal Weapon\". When Lisa is telling the people at Moe's Tavern about the real history of Jebediah Springfield, they all sit with their mouths open. This is a reference to a scene in the film \"The Producers\" from 1968. When Homer knocks over Ned Flanders in order to take over his job as town crier, it is a reference to the film \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" from 1978. Lisa's decision to hide the truth to preserve the myth of Jebediah Springfield is a reference to the film \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\". In addition to these cultural references, at least one author has compared this episode to Friedrich Nietzsche's short work \"On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life\".\n\nThe episode features two neologisms: \"embiggen\" and \"cromulent\". The showrunners asked the writers if they could come up with two words which sounded like real words, and these were what they came up with. The Springfield town motto is \"A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.\" Schoolteacher Edna Krabappel comments that she had never heard the word \"embiggen\" until she moved to Springfield. Miss Hoover, another teacher, replies, \"I don't know why; it’s a perfectly cromulent word.\" Later in the episode, while talking about Homer's audition for the role of town crier, Principal Skinner states, \"He's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance.\"\n\n\"Embiggen\"—in the context in which it is used in the episode—is a verb that was coined independently by Dan Greaney in 1996. The literal meaning is \"to make something larger\", with the morphology (\"em-\" + \"big\" + -en) being parallel to that of \"enlarge\" (\"en-\" + \"large\"). The verb had in fact previously occurred in an 1884 edition of the British journal \"Notes and Queries: A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men, General Readers, Etc.\" by C. A. Ward, in the sentence \"but the people magnified them, to make great or \"embiggen\", if we may invent an English parallel as ugly. After all, use is nearly everything.\" The word has made its way to common use and was included in Mark Peters' \"Yada, Yada, Do'h!, 111 Television Words That Made the Leap From the Screen to Society\". In 2018, it was included in the Merriam-Webster dictionary and the online Oxford English Dictionary. In particular, \"embiggen\" can be found in string theory. The first occurrence of the word was in the journal \"High Energy Physics\" in the article \"Gauge/gravity duality and meta-stable dynamical supersymmetry breaking\", which was published on January 23, 2007. For example, the article says: \"For large P, the three-form fluxes are dilute, and the gradient of the Myers potential encouraging an anti-D3 to embiggen is very mild.\" Later this usage was noted in the journal \"Nature\", which explained that in this context, it means \"to grow or expand\".\n\n\"Cromulent\" is an adjective that was coined by David X. Cohen. Since it was coined, it has appeared in Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon. The meaning of \"cromulent\" is inferred only from its usage, which indicates that it is a positive attribute. Dictionary.com defines it as meaning \"fine\" or \"acceptable\". Ben Macintyre has written that it means \"valid or acceptable\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lisa the Iconoclast\" finished 70th in the ratings for the week of February 12 to 18, 1996. The episode was the sixth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"Melrose Place\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", \"Married... with Children\", and Fox Tuesday Night Movie: \"Cliffhanger\".\n\nThe episode received extremely positive reviews from television critics. \n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson lauded it for the focus on Lisa, commenting that \"Lisa-centered episodes tend to be preachy, but I suppose that’s inevitable given her character. I like the fact Lisa takes the high road here, though, as she proves she doesn’t always have to be right. Homer’s turn as the town crier brings mirth to a solid show.\" \n\nIn addition, John Alberti praised the episode in his book \"Leaving Springfield\" as \"an especially cromulent example of the narrative fissuring and disruptive disclosure...Lisa spends the entire episode uncovering the truth about Jebediah and courageously defending her findings against a phalanx of authority figures...a symbol of honesty, integrity, and courage. All in all, a spectacular episode revealing the truth behind our society.\" \n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was a \"clever\" episode, and highlighted Lisa's fantasy of the fight between Springfeld and George Washington as \"fantastic\". Dave Foster of DVD Times thought Sutherland offered a \"memorable\" guest appearance. \n\n\"Total Film\"s Nathan Ditum ranked Sutherland's performance as the 14th best guest appearance in the show's history. Michael Moran of \"The Times\" ranked the episode as the eighth best in the show's history. \n\nMartin Belam of \"The Guardian\" named it one of the five greatest episodes in \"Simpsons\" history.\n\nThe episode was included on April 28, 1997 on the VHS set \"The Dark Secrets of the Simpsons\", alongside \"The Springfield Files\", \"Homer the Great\", and \"Homer Badman\". On September 8, 2003, the VHS tape was released on DVD under the name \"The Simpsons: Dark Secrets\" in Region 2 and Region 4, but \"Homer the Great\" was replaced by \"Homer to the Max\". It was released again on DVD on December 13, 2005 as part of \"The Simpsons Complete Seventh Season\". Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Jonathan Collier, Yeardley Smith, Mike B. Anderson, and David Silverman participated in the DVD's audio commentary.\n\n"}

{"id": "2079640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079640", "title": "Biohazard (band)", "text": "Biohazard (band)\n\nBiohazard is an American band formed in Brooklyn, New York, in 1987. They are acknowledged as one of the earliest bands to fuse hardcore punk and heavy metal with elements of hip hop. The earliest lineup consisted of bassist-vocalist Evan Seinfeld, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Anthony Meo. Guitarist-vocalist Billy Graziadei would join the band soon after, changing the band to a four-piece. Since February 2016, the lineup has consisted of Graziadei, Hambel, and Danny Schuler.\n\nThe band formed in Brooklyn in 1987. Their first demo, released in 1988, caused a stir with journalists who felt that some of the band's lyrics displayed fascist and white supremacist views, overlooking that both Seinfeld and Schuler were, themselves, Jewish. The accusations of racism in their music were denied by the band but in later interviews, Seinfeld and Graziadei explained that it had been a publicity stunt to win over the band Carnivore and their fans. Additionally, Seinfeld has defended the lyrics of songs such as \"Master Race\" and \"America\" as metaphors meant to gain the attention of listeners and maintains that the band was never racist. After the release of the first demo, Anthony Meo left the band and drummer Danny Schuler replaced him. A second demo tape followed in 1989.\n\nAlthough Biohazard did not present themselves as a hardcore band, they shared stages with bands associated with the New York hardcore scene, such as the Cro-Mags and Agnostic Front. They also shared stages with the New Jersey band Mucky Pup and a friendship between the two bands developed.\n\nIn 1990, Biohazard signed a recording contract with Maze Records. The band's self-titled debut album was poorly promoted by the label and sold approximately 40,000 copies. The album's subject matter revolved around Brooklyn, gang-wars, drugs, and violence.\n\nOne year after the release of their debut album, Seinfeld and Graziadei contributed vocals to the song \"Three Dead Gophers\" from Mucky Pup's third album, \"Now\". The album was released on Roadrunner Records, who would soon release Biohazard's second album.\n\nIn 1992, Biohazard signed with Roadrunner Records and released \"Urban Discipline,\" which gave the band national and worldwide attention in both the heavy metal and hardcore communities. The video for the song \"Punishment\" became the most played video in the history of MTV's \"Headbanger's Ball\", and the album sold over one million copies. The band also began opening for larger acts such as House of Pain, Sick Of It All, Fishbone, and Kyuss.\n\nIn 1993, the hardcore rap group Onyx recorded an alternate \"Bionyx\" version of their hit single \"Slam\" with Biohazard as their backup band. This led to a collaboration on the title track of the \"Judgment Night\" soundtrack. The soundtrack would go on to sell over two million copies in the United States.\n\nMonths later, the band left Roadrunner Records and signed with Warner Bros. Records Inc., who released their third studio LP, \"State of the World Address\". The album was produced by Ed Stasium in Los Angeles and contained the single \"How It Is\" featuring Sen Dog of Cypress Hill, for which a video was also shot. During their 1994 tour, the band made an appearance on the second stage at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington. \"State of the World Address\" went on to sell over one million copies, and \"Rolling Stone\" magazine selected the Biohazard logo as the best logo of the year. This was the last Biohazard album with Bobby Hambel, who left due to differences with the rest of the band. Hambel spent time in White Devil, also featuring members of the Cro-Mags, before seemingly leaving the music business entirely. In late 1995, the band, along with Therapy? and Gunshot, contributed remixes to the Pitchshifter album \"The Remix War\".\n\nThe band recorded their fourth studio album, \"Mata Leao\", as a three-piece in 1996. It was produced with the help of Dave Jerden. For the 1996–97 Mata Leao Tour, the band hired former Helmet guitarist Rob Echeverria. The band also played on the Ozzfest mainstage alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Slayer, Danzig, Fear Factory, and Sepultura.\n\nWhile touring Europe in support of the \"Mata Leao\" album, the band recorded their Hamburg, Germany, show for their first live album, \"No Holds Barred (Live in Europe)\", which was released in 1997 through their former label, Roadrunner Records.\n\nIn 1998, Seinfeld began his acting career playing Jaz Hoyt on HBO's award-winning series \"Oz\". The character was introduced in the second season and appeared throughout the series' sixth and final season.\n\nThe band signed to Mercury Records and released their fifth studio album, \"New World Disorder,\" in 1999, once again with Ed Stasium as a producer. The relationship with Mercury Records soured quickly as the band felt betrayed and misunderstood by the label. They severed their ties with the label amidst the merger of Mercury Records, Island Records, Def Jam Records, and Polygram into the Universal Music Group.\n\nIn 2000, the band continued to tour Europe and Japan, without the support of a record label or management. In 2001, the band released a compilation album titled \"Tales From The B-Side\". The album consisted of various B-sides and remixes from various eras in the band's recording history. The album was released by the Phantom Sound & Vision label. After the release of \"Tales From The B-Side\", Rob Echeverria resigned from the band in order to get married. Leo Curley, of Outline and All Means Necessary, was hired as his replacement.\n\nIn the same year, Biohazard signed two new record deals with SPV/Steamhammer in Europe and Sanctuary Records for the remainder of the world. Despite the new record deals, the band took some personal time in order to work on other projects.\n\nGraziadei briefly formed a trip hop project with Jenifer Bair of the Ohio band Hilo. After writing and recording approximately twenty songs for the project named Blu, Bair relocated to Los Angeles, California to continue an art career and the project dissolved. Graziadei also began work on a book, \"Tales From The Hardside.\" Schuler used his downtime to perform with New York band Among Thieves as a replacement drummer for the departing Will Shepler.\n\nGraziadei and Schuler also collaborated in transforming the band's rehearsal Brooklyn studio into a digital recording studio, known as Rat Piss Studios and soon after changed the name to Underground Sound Studios. Re-investing into the band, Graziadei and Schuler honed their engineering and productions skills while recording and producing local acts and new Biohazard demos. The band then undertook the process of writing, recording, and producing their own music.\n\nTheir studio work led to the band's sixth studio album, \"Uncivilization,\" released in September 2001. The album featured several guest appearances by members of bands such as Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Pantera, Slipknot, Sepultura, Cypress Hill, Skarhead, and Type O Negative. Shortly after the release of \"Uncivilization,\" Leo Curley left the band to focus on writing his own music. He was replaced by former Nucleus member Carmine Vincent, who had previously toured with Biohazard as part of their road crew.\n\nIn 2002, Seinfeld became engaged to porn star Tera Patrick. Patrick had never heard of Seinfeld prior to seeing one of his nude scenes on \"Oz.\" After making several phone calls, Patrick was able to contact Seinfeld, who had never heard of her either, and the two began dating.\n\nThe band had to cancel scheduled European festival dates when Carmine Vincent underwent major surgery. The band did manage to find a temporary guitarist, Scott Roberts, formerly of the Cro-Mags and the Spudmonsters, in time to join the Eastpak Resistance Tour with Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat, Born From Pain and All Boro Kings.\n\nBiohazard completed their seventh studio album in seventeen days; \"Kill Or Be Killed\" was released in 2003. While touring North America with Kittie, Brand New Sin and Eighteen Visions, Biohazard announced that Roberts would remain as their permanent lead guitarist. The tour was curtailed when it was announced that Seinfeld had fallen ill.\n\nWith more downtime due to Seinfeld's illness, Graziadei and Schuler collaborated to mix Life of Agony's live comeback album, \"River Runs Again: Live 2003.\" Once Seinfeld was healthy again, the band toured Japan and North America, headlining over bands such as Hatebreed, Agnostic Front, Throwdown, and Full Blown Chaos.\n\nOnce home, Seinfeld began recording and circulating demos for his own trip hop project named Triplesicks. For a brief time, Graziadei and his wife moved to Brazil where their daughter was born. While there, Graziadei struck up a friendship with drummer Fernandao Schafer. After jamming together in the studio, Schafer formed the band Ink which Graziadei would eventually produce and later join. It wasn't long before Ink was renamed Endrah and an EP titled \"DEMONstration\" was released. Once Graziadei returned to New York City, the logistical problems of traveling back and forth caused Graziadei to quit Endrah.\n\nIn early 2004, Graziadei teamed up with gabber DJ Rob Gee to help write and produce his music. When a few albums were completed, Graziadei joined Schuler, Roberts, DJ Starscream (aka Sid Wilson of Slipknot), Jeff Anthony, and Keith Rooney, both of Gutwrench, to form Ampt. The band combined gabber music with hardcore and heavy metal. After writing several songs and putting together a live band, Graziadei and Schuler left the project in order to continue with Biohazard. Ampt has gone through several additional lineup changes since.\n\nAlso in 2004, Seinfeld, now residing in Los Angeles, California, married his fiancée of two years, Tera Patrick.\n\nBy the end of 2004, the band had begun recording its eighth studio album, \"Means To An End.\" The completed album was lost in a studio disaster, forcing the band to completely re-record the album, which was finally released in August 2005.\n\nIn the meantime, Graziadei had formed another new band with former members of Kitte and The Groovenics. Originally named Rodek, the band eventually changed their name to Suicide City. In October 2004, Graziadei announced that \"Means To An End\" had been the final Biohazard album and that he would continue playing with Suicide City as his main focus. One month later, on the Biohazard website, it was announced that there would in fact be a 2005 Biohazard tour.\n\nOn December 15, Seinfeld and Graziadei participated in the Roadrunner United conglomerate event at the Nokia Theater in New York City for an all-star event. The show opened with Biohazard's \"Punishment,\" performed by Seinfeld, Graziadei, Sepultura's Andreas Kisser, former Fear Factory member Dino Cazares, and Slipknot's Joey Jordison.\n\nIn 2005, Seinfeld and Patrick formed The Tera Patrick Agency with the goal of representing talent in both the adult and mainstream entertainment business. That same year, Suicide City released their first EP, \"Not My Year\", and continued to tour as an opening act for acts such as Danzig, Taking Back Sunday, Mindless Self Indulgence, Otep and Gwar. The band's full-length album, \"Frenzy\", followed in 2009.\n\nIn January 2006, Danny Schuler announced his resignation from Biohazard and the formation of Bloodclot with singer Jon Joseph of the Cro-Mags, guitarist Scott Roberts and bassist Craig Setari of Sick of it All. Roberts later announced that he would also be leaving the band to focus on Bloodclot with Schuler. That same month, Graziadei announced that Biohazard would not go on a farewell tour after all.\n\nGraziadei and Schuler relocated their recording studio to South Amboy, New Jersey and renamed it Underground Sound Studios. The studio was renovated to include a live room with ceilings and of studio space. After Schuler's departure from the studio business, Graziadei relocated the studio to Los Angeles and changed the name to Firewater Studios.\n\nIn February 2006, Seinfeld participated in the filming of \"SuperGroup\", a VH-1 reality television series also starring Ted Nugent, Scott Ian, Sebastian Bach and Jason Bonham as a supergroup named Damnocracy. The show debuted on May 21, 2006.\n\nIn March 2007, Evan Seinfeld debuted his new band, The Spyderz, as an opening act for a Buckcherry performance. The band was originally named White Line Fever, until it was discovered that a UK band already owned the name. The Spyderz also featured guitarist John Monte, formerly of Ministry and M.O.D. In October 2008, Seinfeld also briefly joined Tattooed Millionaires as a bassist and co-vocalist. Seinfeld and Tera Patrick separated in 2009 and divorced in 2010.\n\nIn January 2008, the classic lineup of Evan Seinfeld, Billy Graziadei, Danny Schuler and Bobby Hambel made the announcement that rehearsals had begun for a 2008 summer tour to commemorate the band's 20th anniversary. They toured Australia and New Zealand in April with Chimaira, Throwdown, Bloodsimple and headliners Korn to celebrate their newly declared reunion. The band also took part in Persistence Tour 2009, and announced at one of their shows that they were working on a new record. It was also noted that the album would be dedicated to Type O Negative frontman Peter Steele who died in April 2010. Biohazard brought in producer Toby Wright to work on the album and after several months at Graziadei's Firewater Studios in Los Angeles, the band completed their recording sessions.\n\nIn June 2011, Biohazard announced that they had amicably parted ways with Evan Seinfeld. Scott Roberts returned to replace Seinfeld for two UK dates but no decision regarding a permanent replacement was made. In August 2011, the band announced that they were searching for a full-time singer to replace Seinfeld and opened auditions to the public. In September 2011, three months after his departure from Biohazard, Seinfeld joined Los Angeles-based heavy metal band, Attika 7, which also featured Tony Campos, formerly of Soulfly and Static-X, and Rusty Coones. Attika 7 began recording their debut album for THC Music/Rocket Science in February 2012. After several lineup changes, including the departure of Campos, the band's debut album, \"Blood of my Enemies\", was released in 2013. Seinfeld also continues to work in adult entertainment as Spyder Jonez, most notably through his production company, Iron Cross Entertainment and Teravison, the production company he co-owns with his former wife, Tera Patrick, as well as his own \"Rockstar Pornstar\" website.\n\nIn January 2012, the band decided that Scott Roberts would remain with the band as a permanent member. The new album, \"Reborn in Defiance\", was released worldwide, with the exception of North America, on January 20, 2012, through the Nuclear Blast label. The band originally planned to offer a digital edition of the album as a free download for American fans on the same date but those plans were canceled at the last moment. The album never received a United States label partner or release.\n\nIn support of the album, Biohazard embarked on a short co-headlining tour of Europe with Suicidal Tendencies in the latter half of January 2012. The band arrived in Belgium to begin the tour on January 20 where abruptly, Scott Roberts was rushed to the hospital. After going through several tests and receiving no answers concerning his ailment, Roberts checked himself out of the hospital in time to perform with the band. After their set, Roberts was rushed back to the hospital. Roberts was released from the hospital in time to continue on with the tour at the next stop in Oberhausen, Germany, on January 21. On January 22, Schuler left the tour to in order to return home and be with his wife for the birth of their baby. Danny Lamagna of Sworn Enemy and Suicide City stepped in to replace Schuler until he was able to return.\n\nIn July 2015, Schuler indicated that the band was actively working on a new album. On February 10, 2016, the band announced that previously scheduled upcoming shows had been cancelled, and that Scott Roberts was no longer a member of the band. In December 2017, Roberts clarified that he had quit the band due to not getting along with one of the other members and not enjoying being in the band anymore.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, the debut album from Graziadei's new band Powerflo was released. Graziadei formed the band with Sen Dog (Senen Reyes) of Cypress Hill, Rogelio Lozano of Downset., and Christian Olde Wolbers of Fear Factory. A follow-up EP titled \"Bring That Shit Back\" followed in June 2018. Coinciding with the EP's release, it was also announced that Graziadei would be releasing a solo album later in the year, under the name BillyBio. It was also stated that BillyBio would serve as the opening act on the European dates of Life of Agony's Rise of the Underground tour in October. The first BillyBio album, \"Feed the Fire\", was released on November 30, 2018.\n\nIn January 2019, Graziadei explained that, despite not performing or recording since 2015, Biohazard still existed as a band and that when the time was right, there would be a new Biohazard record.\n\nCurrent members \nFormer members\nTimeline \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079662", "title": "Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts", "text": "Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts\n\nThe Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is a Byzantine Rite liturgical service which is performed on the weekdays of Great Lent wherein communion is received from Gifts (the Body and Blood of Christ) that are sanctified (consecrated) in advance, hence its name; this Divine Liturgy has no anaphora (eucharistic prayer).\n\nThe Presanctified is used on the weekdays of Great Lent, a season of repentance, fasting, and intensified prayer when the more frequent reception of communion is desirable; however, the full Divine Liturgy having a joyful character is not in keeping with the somberness of the season of repentance (\"Eucharist\" literally means \"thanksgiving\") and so the Presanctified is substituted. Although this service may be performed on any weekday (Monday through Friday) of Great Lent, common parish practice is to celebrate it only on Wednesdays, Fridays, and a feast day on which the polyeleos is sung that falls on a weekday. The Typicon also prescribes the Presanctified on the Thursday of the Great Canon (the fifth Thursday of Lent), and on first three days of Holy Week.\n\nThe following outline is extracted from the Liturgicon (Priest's Service Book)\n\nThe Presanctified Liturgy, aside from having no anaphora (eucharistic prayer) is structured much like other vesperal divine liturgies that are prescribed for strict fast days. After the normal opening of the Liturgy of the Catechumens (\"Blessed is the Kingdom ...\") vespers proceeds normally until the kathisma, the three stasees (subdivisions) of which are treated as three antiphons with silent prayers of the antiphons analogous to those of the other Divine Liturgies.\n\nIf the consecrated Lamb is already on table of prothesis, the priest puts it on the diskos, pours wine and water in the chalice, covers and censes them. Otherwise, during the first antiphon the Lamb is placed on the diskos, which is covered and censed. During the second antiphon, the priest, preceded by a deacon with a lighted candle, processes round the holy table thrice, each time censing it in the form of a cross. During the third antiphon the priest prostrates before the gifts which he then places on his head and carries, preceded by the deacon with lighted candle and censer, to the prothesis table where he censes and covers the gifts and pours wine and water into the chalice which he likewise covers.\n\nThe Great Entrance takes place in a manner similar to that of the Divine Liturgy, except that the priest rather than the deacon carries the diskos, he holds it higher than the chalice, and the entrance is made in absolute silence, while everyone makes a full prostration.\n\nWhen it comes time for Holy Communion, the clergy make their communion as normal, except that no words accompany their drinking from the chalice. Those portions of the reserved Lamb which will be used to give communion to the faithful are placed in unconsecrated wine in the chalice. Local opinion varies as to whether or not this unconsecrated wine must be thought of as the Blood of Christ (even if the bread was intincted). The only practical effect of this variety is that the celebrant (priest or deacon) who must consume all the undistributed communion at the end of the service might or might not partake of the chalice when he communes himself: if the wine that was poured into the chalice is \"not\" the Blood of Christ, he would need to consume all of the consecrated elements before drinking any of the wine because drinking unconsecrated wine breaks the Eucharistic fast.\n\nOn the previous Sunday, additional Lambs (Hosts) are prepared and consecrated, enough for all of the Presanctified Liturgies that will be celebrated in the coming week. The exact same ceremonies and actions accompany the preparation and consecration of the extra lambs, as the one which will be used that day at the Divine Liturgy. After the consecration, just before the communion of the clergy, the rubric calls for the consecrated Lamb to be intincted with the consecrated Blood of Christ; however, depending on local practice, this is sometimes not done. In either case, the consecrated Lambs are reserved, often in a special pyx used only for this purpose.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts was first documented by Pope Gregory I (540–604), who had been the papal legate to Constantinople. At one time it was supposed that he had composed the Liturgy himself, but now it is generally supposed that he simply recorded what was otherwise being practiced at Constantinople. In the Presanctified Liturgy itself, he is still commemorated as its traditional author.\n\nThis Liturgy is also mentioned in the Canons of the Quinisext Council, of 692 AD:\n\"On all days of the holy fast of Lent, except on the Sabbath \"[i.e., Saturday]\", the Lord's Day \"[Sunday]\", and the holy day of the Annunciation, the Liturgy of the Presanctified is to be served (Canon 52).\"\n\nAlthough the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is associated primarily with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Catholics, it is known in other churches.\n\nIn the liturgy of the Roman Rite on Good Friday, there is a similar rite that has been unofficially called the Mass of the Presanctified: the rite of Commemoration of the Lord's Passion. Because there is no consecration of the gifts in that liturgy, it is not a Mass, being instead reception of Holy Communion from the reserved sacrament which was consecrated at Mass on Holy Thursday.\n\nIn the Anglican Communion, the Book of Common Prayer for the United States provides likewise for the consecration of the reserved sacrament on Maundy Thursday and its reception at the special liturgy of Good Friday.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts was once used in the West Syriac Rite, the liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church, but has fallen into disuse in most of the Syriac Orthodox communion. However, it continues to be used in the Malankara Rite, a variant historically practiced in the Malankara Church of India, and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it. The Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is also used at some occasions in the Assyrian Church of the East.\n\n"}
{"id": "2079664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079664", "title": "LNER Thompson Class B1", "text": "LNER Thompson Class B1\n\nThe London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Thompson Class B1 is a class of steam locomotive designed for medium mixed traffic work. It was designed by Edward Thompson.\n\nIt was the LNER's equivalent to the highly successful GWR Hall Class and the LMS Stanier Black Five, two-cylinder mixed traffic 4-6-0s. However, it had the additional requirement of having to be cheap because, due to wartime and post-war economies, the LNER, never the richest railway company, had to make savings.\n\nIntroduced in 1942, the first example, No. 8301, was named \"Springbok\" in honour of a visit by Jan Smuts. The first 40 of the class were named after breeds of antelopes and the like, and they became known as bongos after 8306 \"Bongo\". 274 were built by the LNER. 136 were built by British Railways after nationalisation in 1948. The total number in stock at any one time however was only 409 as 61057 was involved in an accident in 1950 and was scrapped.\n\nThe prototype for the new B class (later classified B1) 4-6-0 was built at Darlington and entered service on 12 December 1942. It was the first 2-cylinder main-line locomotive constructed for the LNER since the grouping, such had been Sir Nigel Gresley's faith in the 3 cylinder layout. With cost saving a wartime priority the LNER's draughtsmen went to great lengths to re-use existing patterns, jigs and tools to economise on materials and labour. Extensive use was made of welding instead of steel castings. The boiler was derived from the Diagram 100A type fitted to the LNER Class B17 Sandringham 4-6-0s but with a larger grate area and an increase in boiler pressure to .\n\nThe appearance of No. 8301 (subsequently renumbered No. 1000) coincided with a visit to Britain by the Prime Minister of South Africa, Field Marshal Jan Smuts, and, as mentioned above, it was named Springbok. 18 other B1s took the names of LNER directors. Not that there were many B1s to be named during the war years: constraints on production meant that the first ten were not completed until 1944. However, Thompson then placed substantial orders with two outside builders: Vulcan Foundry and the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow.\nBetween April 1946 and April 1952 NBL built 290 B1s. Over the period the cost of each engine rose from £14,893 to £16,190. Vulcan Foundry contributed 50 at £15,300 apiece. Orders for the B1s, which became Nos. 61000–61409 under British Railways, totalled 410.\n\nThe B1s operated throughout LNER territory. The first batch was distributed among depots on the former Great Eastern Railway section: Ipswich, Norwich, and Stratford in London. They were an immediate success and were soon working the Liverpool Street - Harwich boat trains, the \"Hook Continental\", the \"Day Continental\" and the \"Scandinavian\". B1s were also a familiar sight on other top-link workings such as \"The East Anglian\", \"The Broadsman\" and \"The Fenman\". During the 1950s over 70 B1s were stationed on ex-GE lines.\n\nThey enjoyed similar popularity on ex-Great Northern and Great Central territory. Engines based at Darnall, Sheffield were regularly rostered for the \"Master Cutler\" and \"South Yorkshireman\" expresses. Elsewhere there were substantial allocations in Scotland, West Yorkshire and East Yorkshire.\n\nIf any fault is to be highlighted on the B1, it must be the ride quality. O.S. Nock often criticised the B1s for a poor ride, not something many were used to on the Gresley engines. The B1 was very cheap to build, but the final result was an engine that was somewhat lacking in the quality LNER men had come to expect. The two-cylinder layout gave the engines good starting power and excellent hill climbing abilities, but it also caused very bad hunting effects, a result of the use of cut-offs of up to 75% (a 10% advance on Gresley engines), and as such they were less kind on the passengers they carried than the B17s they replaced.\n\nOverall, however, it was entirely necessary that the B1s be introduced, because the LNER was operating a large number of engines that were well past their economic life. It was somewhat ironic that among the engines that came under threat with the arrival of the B1s were the ones that Thompson admired the most: the engines of the North Eastern Railway designed by Vincent Raven (his father-in-law).\n\n\n59 of the 410 locomotives were named. Early B1s were named after species of antelope, whilst later engines were named after members of the board of directors of the LNER. This led to the fact that the Class B1 contained the shortest name given to a British locomotive ((6)1018 \"Gnu\") and one of the longest ((6)1221 \"Sir Alexander Erskine-Hill\").\n\nWith the change in the policies of British Railways, the B1s were withdrawn long before their projected economic working life. Excepting No. 61057 which was destroyed in an accident in 1950, the first normal withdrawal was No. 61085 in November 1961. The remaining locomotives were withdrawn between 1962 and 1967.\n\nAfter withdrawal from capital stock, 17 were taken into departmental stock where they were used as boilers for carriage heating. For this they had their couplers removed so they could not haul trains, though they could still propel themselves.\n\nTwo have been preserved, these being 61264 and 61306. Both of these were built by North British Locomotive Company.\n\n\n"}

The region surrounds the city of Limoges (). Limousin lies in the foothills of the western edge of the Massif Central, with cold weather in the winter. Its name is derived from the name of a Celtic tribe, the Lemovices whose main sanctuary was recently found in Tintignac and became a major site for Celtic studies thanks to unique objects which were found such as the carnyces, unique in the whole Celtic world.\n\nDuring the 3rd century, Saint Martial () evangelized the region, and became the first Bishop of Limoges.\n\nDuring the 10th century, Limousin was divided into many \"seigneuries\"; the most important of them, located in the southern part of the region, were the \"vicomtés\" of Limoges, Comborn (in present-day Corrèze), Ventadour (today Ussel and Plateau de Millevaches), and Turenne. The northernmost part of Limousin belonged to the County of La Marche, while the bishops of Limoges controlled most of present-day Haute-Vienne. Such political fragmentation led to the construction of many castles, whose ruins still evoke memories of that historical period.\n\nIn 1199, King Richard I of England was fatally wounded by a crossbow bolt during his siege of Château de Châlus-Chabrol, about southwest of Limoges. \nThe region was reconstituted during the Fifth Republic as part of decentralization efforts by the French government.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079686", "title": "Mommie Dearest (film)", "text": "Mommie Dearest (film)\n\nMommie Dearest is a 1981 American biographical black comedy-drama film directed by Frank Perry. The film depicts Christina Crawford's adoptive mother, actress Joan Crawford as an abusive and manipulative mother who hurt her adopted children.\n\nStarring Faye Dunaway, Mara Hobel, and Diana Scarwid, the film was adapted for the screen by Robert Getchell, Tracy Hotchner, Frank Perry, and Frank Yablans from the 1978 autobiography of the same name by Christina. The executive producers were Christina's husband, David Koontz, and Terry O'Neill, Dunaway's then-boyfriend and soon-to-be husband. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures, the only one of the Big Eight film studios for which Crawford had never appeared in a feature film.\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $39 million worldwide from a $5 million budget. Despite being panned by critics, the film's bizarre script and highly charged acting, particularly on the part of Dunaway, have brought a cult following to the film as an \"unintentional comedy\". It won the second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.\n\nJoan Crawford is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries controlling the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare to work at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m., scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling water before plunging her face into a bowl of witch hazel and ice to close the pores. When Helga, a new maid, thinks Joan's living room is spotless, Joan finds a minor detail she overlooked and loses her temper.\n\nJoan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt, but her career is in a downswing. Despite wanting a baby, she cannot get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone ended in miscarriages. When denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl, Christina, and then a boy, Christopher. Joan lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with birthday gifts, Joan allows her to choose just one to keep and donates the rest to charity.\n\nWhen Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming pool race and laughs at the child; when Christina reacts angrily, Joan becomes enraged and locks the child in the pool house. Later, when Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her, she hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.\n\nJoan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss Louis B. Mayer and argues with Gregg after a dinner at Perino's restaurant. Joan guzzles down glasses of vodka and throws a drink in Gregg's face after he tells her she is getting old. After Gregg breaks up with Joan, she cuts him out of photos. When Mayer forces Joan to leave MGM after theater owners brand her \"box office poison\", she hacks down her prize rose garden with a pair of large gardening shears and an axe.\n\nJoan finds Christina's expensive dresses hanging from wire hangers. Enraged, Joan yanks dresses from Christina's closet, throwing them all over her room, and beats Christina with the wire hanger as she squeals. Declaring the sparkleing clean bathroom floor as dirty, Joan throws cleaning powder all over it before striking Christina across the back with the can and screaming at her to clean it.\n\nJoan sends Christina to Chadwick School. Years later, when a teenage Christina is caught in a compromising position with a boy, Joan brings her home. Barbara Bennett, a reporter from \"Redbook\" magazine, is writing a puff piece on Joan's home life. After Joan lies about Christina, Christina confronts her in front of the reporter. Joan slaps Christina twice in the face. After Joan questions Christina about why she never complimented Joan as a mother, Christina realizes that Joan adopted her as a publicity stunt and shouts that she is not one of Joan's fans. Joan tackles Christina to the floor and chokes her, knocking over a lamp in the process, causing Christina to thrash around hopelessly until Joan's live-in assistant and the reporter pull Joan away.\n\nJoan sends Christina to Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy, where Christina is allowed no contact with the outside world. Joan marries Alfred Steele, CEO of Pepsi Cola, moves to New York City and pressures him to shoulder a great deal of debt to fund their lavish lifestyle. After his death, the board tries to force her to resign, but Joan coerces them into letting her retain her seat by threatening to publicly condemn Pepsi.\n\nAfter graduating from Flintridge, Christina rents an apartment in Manhattan, where she acts in a soap opera. When Christina is hospitalized for an ovarian tumor, she is temporarily replaced on the show by her visibly drunk mother. Joan dies of cancer in 1977, whereupon Christina and Christopher learn their mother disinherited them both. When Christopher says their mother has managed to have the last word, Christina questions that.\n\nAccording to Dunaway, producer Frank Yablans promised her in the casting process that he wished to portray Joan Crawford in a more moderate way than she was portrayed in Christina Crawford's book. In securing the rights to the book, Christina's husband David Koontz was given an Executive Producer credit, though he had no experience producing films. Dunaway likewise demanded that her own husband, the photographer Terry O'Neill, be given a producer credit so that he could advocate for her on set. According to Yablans, the two husbands jostled over Dunaway's portrayal of Crawford: “I had two husbands to deal with, David driving me crazy that Faye was trying to sanitize Joan, and Terry worried we were pushing Faye too far and creating a monster.”\n\nIn 2015, actress Rutanya Alda (Carol Ann) published a behind-the-scenes memoir, detailing the making of the film, \"The Mommie Dearest Diary: Carol Ann Tells All\". In it, she describes the difficulty of working with Dunaway, whose method approach to playing Joan seemed to absorb her and make her difficult to the cast and crew. In an interview with the \"Bay Area Reporter\", Alda stated that \"People despised Faye...because she was rude to people. Everyone was on pins and needles when she worked, and relaxed when she didn't.\" Alda described the process of acting opposite Dunaway very unfavorably by claiming that she manipulated the director to deprive the other actors of screen time and required the members of the cast to turn their backs when not in the shot so she would have no audience. She also claimed that Dunaway was \"out of control\" while filming the scene where Joan attacks Christina in front of a reporter (Jocelyn Brando) and Carol Ann has to pull her off. Alda was hit hard in the chest and knocked over several times, while Jocelyn Brando, who was scripted to help Alda pull Dunaway off of Diana Scarwid, refused to get near her for fear of being injured.\n\nAs of August 2019, the film had a 49% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 43 film critics. The site's consensus states: \"\"Mommie Dearest\" certainly doesn't lack for conviction, and neither does Faye Dunaway's legendary performance as a wire-wielding monster; unfortunately, the movie is too campy and undisciplined to transcend guilty pleasure.\"\n\nRoger Ebert opened his one-star review with \"I can't imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie,\" calling it \"unremittingly depressing, not to any purpose of drama or entertainment, but just to depress. It left me feeling creepy.\" About Dunaway's performance, \"Variety\" said, \"Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, costars and all.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called it \"an extremely strange movie\" yet \"a peculiarly engaging film, one that can go from the ridiculous to the sublime and back again within a single scene, sometimes within a single speech.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that \"'Mommie Dearest' isn't a bad film, it's more of an incomplete story,\" because the script \"doesn't care enough to attempt a thoughtful answer to the most obvious question of all—why? Why did Joan Crawford punish her adopted daughter with beatings and isolation? Why did Joan Crawford force her adopted son to wear, in effect, a harness to strap him in bed? I don't think you can show such extraordinary behavior in a film about a famous person and not offer some answers. It's simply not responsible filmmaking, both intellectually and dramatically.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that Faye Dunaway \"is a terrific Joan Crawford,\" but the film \"plays like a limp parody of a bad Crawford movie. When Dunaway's Crawford, who's a seething volcano of emotions, finally erupts, the effect is laughable, rather than terrifying or pathetic, so pallid is the picture. 'Mommie Dearest' is at best campy, and at worst, merely plodding.\" Pauline Kael declared that Faye Dunaway gave \"a startling, ferocious performance,\" adding that \"Dunaway brings off these camp horror scenes—howling 'No wire hangers!' and weeping while inflecting 'Tina, bring me the axe' with the beyond-the-crypt chest tones of a basso profundo—but she also invests the part with so much power and suffering that these scenes transcend camp.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"one doesn't envy screen writers obliged to hack a playable, coherent continuity out of the complicated chronology and simple-minded psychoanalysis that clogs the book. It's a booby-trapped source, and there are intermittent signs of both skill and wariness in the filmmakers ... But once the ugly stuff begins, all that methodical preparation and desire to be fair becomes meaningless. The movie is committed to a prolonged, exhibitionistic wallow and can't escape the trashy consequences.\"\n\nAmong retrospective reviews, \"Slant Magazine\" awarded the film four stars in the May 31, 2006 edition. Also Dennis Price wrote that \"Faye Dunaway portrays Joan Crawford in a likeness so chilling it's almost unnatural\" in his assessment of the film for \"DVD Review.\"\n\nRoughly a month into release, Paramount realized the film was getting a reputation at the box office as an unintentional comedy and changed its advertising to reflect its new camp status, proclaiming, \"Meet the biggest MOTHER of them all!\"\n\nFor decades, Dunaway was famously reluctant to discuss \"Mommie Dearest\" in interviews. In her autobiography, she only briefly mentions the film by stating that she wished that director Perry had had enough experience to see when actors needed to rein in their performances. More recently, she has expressed her regret over taking the part and blamed it for causing a decline in her Hollywood career. She also claimed that the performance took a heavy emotional toll on her stating: “At night I would go home to the house we had rented in Beverly Hills, and felt Crawford in the room with me, this tragic, haunted soul just hanging around.… It was as if she couldn’t rest.” By coincidence, Joan once said in an interview in the early 1970s that of the current young actresses, only Faye Dunaway had \"what it takes\" to be a true star.\n\nAt the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards it won in multiple categories:\n\n\nAt the 10th Golden Raspberry Awards it also won the worst picture of the decade.\n\nWhile the film was a mere dishonourable mention for Worst Picture in the original ballot for the 1981 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the revised ballot released in 2007 gave it the following nominations and wins:\n\n\nThe film is recognized by the American Film Institute in the following lists:\n\n\n"}

It was designed in 1943 by Henryk Strąpoć and was produced in underground facilities in the area of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski. Its name was coined after the Bataliony Chłopskie organization members who were informally called \"bechowiec\" (plural: \"bechowcy\").\n\nThe gun's designer was Henryk Strąpoć (born 1922), a blacksmith and self-taught amateur gunsmith in the village of Czerwona Góra, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. Between 1936 and 1939 years he illegally built four semi-automatic pistols of his own design. During the German occupation of Poland he became a gunsmith for the local Bataliony Chłopskie underground organization. In spring of 1943 he completed a working prototype of his own submachine gun, later named Bechowiec. He later improved the design with a help of Jan Swat, who formerly worked as a mechanic in the metalworks in Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski.\n\nThe headquarters of Opatów BCh district, lacking machine guns, decided to organize a serial production of the Bechowiec. This was possible thanks to the clandestine production of parts for the guns in a metalworks in Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, without the knowledge of the German administration. These parts were produced there and, from October 1943, smuggled out by workers. Final construction of the guns was done in Strąpoć's village blacksmith shop, with primitive muscle-powered tooling. Barrels were made from scrapped World War I-vintage rifles, but they had to be hand-cut and rebored to 9 mm caliber.\n\nThe first two new Bechowiec submachine guns were completed in January 1944. Until July 1944, 11 were completed in Czerwona Góra, and at least two more in Jan Swat's workshop in Broniszowice. Some 20 were in production, but as the tide of the war turned and the front lines approached the village, German presence was more intense and forced secret gun production to be stopped. The unfinished weapons and parts were hidden.\n\nThe weapons were distributed among Bataliony Chłopskie and affiliated Ludowa Straż Bezpieczeństwa (\"People's Security Guard\") partisan units, mostly in the area around Opatów. Only one Bechowiec-1 is still in existence; it is currently exhibited in the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw.\n\nThe next weapon with this name was the Bechowiec-2, designed and produced from April 1944 by Jan Swat in Broniszowice, and patterned after the Sten gun.\n\nA lack of experience of Strąpoć in machine guns' designing and lack of direct patterns resulted in several original construction features, similar to semi-automatic pistols, and hence the weapon is sometimes referred to as a machine pistol, in spite of a size and general layout closer to a submachine gun. The weapon had no stock and had quite compact dimensions. It used standard German 9mm Parabellum ammunition which could be easily obtained either by purchase from the German soldiers or through armed actions. Three or four last weapons used 7.62×25mm Soviet ammunition, of growing popularity among partisans.\n\nThe weapon used a slide, much like an automatic pistol and fired from a closed breech, which added to its accuracy in single-shot mode. It also had an internal hammer and an internal safety device, preventing from shooting with not fully closed breech. A breech could be brought back by pulling a transport belt, fixed to a slide under the barrel. The gun had a three-position external safety and firing mode selector.\n\nThe weapons had a signature \"S.H. w.44\" on a left side (Strąpoć Henryk, pattern 1944) and \"B.H\" on a right side. Production guns were painted black, only the surviving exhibit was later polished.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079695", "title": "Shoney's", "text": "Shoney's\n\nShoney's is a privately held restaurant chain headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. It operates restaurants in 17 states, primarily in the South with additional locations in the Midwest and lower Mid-Atlantic states. \n\nFounder Alex Schoenbaum opened the first Parkette Drive-In in 1947, and became a licensee of Big Boy Restaurants in 1952. Two years later the name was changed to Shoney's, and aggressive subfranchising followed. Thirty years later, having outgrown its Big Boy territory, Shoney's dropped the Big Boy affiliation.\n\nShoney's is currently owned by David Davoudpour who purchased the company in 2006 through Royal Hospitality Corporation in Atlanta. \n\nIn 1947, Alex Schoenbaum opened the Parkette Drive-In next to his father's bowling alley in Charleston, West Virginia. After meeting with Big Boy founder Bob Wian in 1951, Schoenbaum became a Big Boy franchisee on February 7, 1952, now calling his several locations the Parkette Big Boy Shoppes. In May 1954, a public \"Name the Parkette Big Boy Contest\" was announced, and in June 1954 Schoenbaum's five Parkette Drive-Ins were rebranded as Shoney's.\n\nShoney's (the Parkette) was originally the Big Boy franchisee for West Virginia; however, Schoenbaum rapidly grew the chain through subfranchising, expanding his Big Boy territory through the southeastern United States, excluding Florida where the rights already belonged to fellow Big Boy franchisee Frisch's.\n\nSchoenbaum's earliest subfranchisees operated under their own names. In 1955, Leonard Goldstein became a subfranchisee in Roanoke, Virginia. Originally operating as Shoney's, he eventually changed to Lendy's Big Boy after another Shoney's subfranchisee called Yoda's Big Boy opened across town. In 1956 a subfranchise was sold to the Boury brothers in northern West Virginia, who operated as Elby's. Elby's, Lendy's, and Yoda's units were originally listed with Shoney's units on the back of the Shoney's menu. Also in 1956, Schoenbaum sold a subfranchise to Abe Becker in Rochester, New York, for Becker's Big Boy. Two Philadelphia area subfranchises, Tunes and Arnold's, were opened during this period as well. In 1959 subfranchisee Abe Adler opened Adler's Big Boy in Lynchburg, Virginia, which was later sold to Lendy's. Also in 1959 Shap's Big Boy was subfranchised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, later assuming the Shoney's name. After this, all subfranchises went by the name Shoney's.\n\nA Shoney's franchisee would purchase the parent company in 1971. Under his leadership Shoney's doubled in size every four years, eventually operating or licensing over one third of the Big Boy restaurants nationwide.\n\nSelling vending machines in the late 1950s, Ray Danner noticed the popularity of Frisch's Big Boy and other drive–in restaurants. Danner, who had operated small businesses, wanted a single Big Boy in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Because Frisch's had a Louisville franchisee, he and business partner James Craft contacted Alex Schoenbaum and bought the Shoney's Nashville franchise for $1000. In 1959, the pair opened their first Shoney's Big Boy in Madison, a Nashville suburb, built four more by 1961, and a total of seven Shoney's Big Boys when Danner bought Craft's interest. Then known as \"Shoney's Big Boy of Middle Tennessee\", by 1966 the company operated 10 Big Boys. That year Danner acquired the Louisville Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise, which would grow to 22 stores over 15 years.\n\nIn 1969, \"Shoney's Big Boy of Middle Tennessee\" and the KFC subsidiary became a public company and was renamed \"Danner Foods, Inc.\", with Danner as president. The company now included 14 Big Boy restaurants, and by 1970, added one Big Boy in Columbus, Georgia and another in Opelika, Alabama. Danner wanted additional Shoney's territory but Schoenbaum was developing those areas himself, so the company opened a similar \"Danner's Family Restaurant\" in Louisville, the first of several. \n\nDanner Foods opened a fast-food seafood and hamburger concept, Mr. D's Seafood and Hamburgers. Launched on August 15, 1969, 9 stores would open by January 1971, growing to 32 stores by 1975, when Danner's namesake Mr. D's would remove hamburgers from the menu, focusing on seafood entirely and being renamed Captain D's, along with franchises being offered. By 1977, over 140 restaurants had opened and \"Hamburger\" was dropped from the \"Captain D's Seafood\" name. The number of Captain D's restaurants would quadruple over the following decade. Danner Foods also opened \"Mr. D's Islander Restaurant\" in Huntsville, Alabama, which offered gourmet dining including seafood, steaks and Cantonese cuisine. \n\nBy 1971, Danner's company had become the second largest Shoney's franchisee by number of units. That year, Danner Foods bought the Shoney's trademark and assets from Alex Schoenbaum, Danner becoming president and CEO, moving the headquarters and commissary from Charleston to Nashville; Danner also changed the legal name of the companies from \"Shoney's Big Boy Franchising Companies, Inc.\", \"Parkette Commissary, Inc.\" and his \"Danner Foods, Inc.\" to \"Shoney's Big Boy Enterprises, Inc.\". Schoenbaum became Chairman of the Board of Directors. As director of a public company, he was forced to close his personally owned Shoney's #1, the original Parkette Drive–in, by 1975.\n\nIn 1976, five years after being renamed \"Shoney's Big Boy Enterprises, Inc.\", stockholders approved changing the company name to \"Shoney's, Inc.\" Shoney's said this reflected the company's diverse food service brands, but added, \"Shoney's is not the southern reincarnation of Frisch's Big Boy.\" However, as Schoenbaum's wife Betty said, the change would permit Shoney's to continue expansion beyond the boundary of its Big Boy territory.\n\nIn 1978, the several Danner's Family Restaurants in Louisville, were renamed \"Danner's Towne and Country\" using logos increasingly similar to Shoney's. In 1982, the company opened two Towne and Country restaurants in Tallahassee, Florida, also Frisch's Big Boy territory, but these were co–banded as \"Shoney's Towne and Country\". This caused Frisch's to sue for unfair competition, claiming a strong association of both the \"Shoney's\" name and \"Towne and Country\" concept with \"Big Boy\". Frisch's had already filed similar civil actions against the Wheeling, West Virginia–based Elby's Big Boy franchise, which in 1971, broke ties with Frisch's and operated non–Big Boy Elby's restaurants in Ohio. In March 1984, a Federal district court denied Frish's request for a temporary injunction blocking Shoney's building additional units in Kentucky and Florida. (Frisch's appealed, but in April 1985, a Federal appeals court affirmed the ruling.) \n\nAfter \"Big Boy\" was removed from the company name in 1976, the Big Boy was becoming less and less prominent at Shoney's, disappearing completely from the company's 1983 annual report. Once called \"a meal in one on a double–deck bun\", a company official now called the Big Boy hamburger, \"a Depression burger, a lot of bread and no meat\". Following the March 1984 federal court ruling favoring Shoney's, Marriott Corporation, then owner of the Big Boy trademark, negotiated a settlement that would allow Shoney's to buy out its Big Boy franchise agreement. And in April 1984, Shoney's withdrew from the Big Boy system, paying Marriott $13 million (equivalent to $ million in ). (In August 1984, Elby's likewise dropped its remaining Big Boy affiliation in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.) At the time Shoney's was the largest Big Boy franchise, with 392 Shoney's Big Boy Restaurants, representing more than a third of the national Big Boy chain. Like the former \"Big Boy\" stores, the \"Towne and Country\" units were renamed simply \"Shoney's\". Additional Shoney's restaurants opened in Frisch's Big Boy territory, three in the Cincinnati area, with plans to open three more annually until the market was saturated.\n\nIn April 1989, a class action lawsuit was filed in Pensacola, Florida charging Shoney's with widespread racial discrimination where African American applicants were denied employment, and African American employees were denied promotion, harassed or terminated without cause, based on race, and that white managers were harassed or terminated for objecting to the practices. The case, joined by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, was filed by nine named plaintiffs: five black employees and four white managers.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that racial policies were systemic, involving upper management including chairman Ray Danner, who was named individually as a co-defendant. On restaurant visits, Danner would allegedly tell managers to \"lighten the place up\" if he felt too many blacks were employed at the location, as \"the number of blacks [needed] to coincide with [the] neighborhood ethnic group\". Restaurant managers testified that Danner didn't want blacks seen by customers, because no one wanted to eat at a restaurant where \"a bunch of niggers\" were working. (Danner responded that he could not remember making such statements, and denied use of the racial epithet or having such racial policies.) Managers also testified that company officials instructed them to \"blacken the in the Shoney's logo (or the \"A\" in Application) on job applications of African Americans.\n\nIn 1993, the court approved an award of $105 million, ($132.5 million including costs and fees) the largest discrimination settlement at the time. Danner, who in the interim became a life member of the NAACP, surrendered shares of company stock worth $65 million toward the settlement, and resigned from Shoney's board of directors. The court also ordered a detailed company-wide affirmative action program, including training and educational programs. \n\nAmong an estimated 40 thousand persons in the class, compensation was awarded to every African American person employed at Shoney's company-owned restaurants between February 4, 1985 and November 3, 1992. Eleven persons received the maximum $100,000, (). The suit included company-owned food service operations such as Shoney's, Captain D's and Lee's Famous Recipe, but excluded franchised restaurants.\n\nAt its peak in 1998, the restaurant chain operated or franchised over 1,300 restaurants in 34 states. None of those businesses remains a part of the Shoney's restaurant enterprise today. In 2000, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was acquired by Texas-based investment group Lone Star Funds two years later.\n\nOn January 1, 2007, Lone Star announced that the Shoney's chain - at this point down to 272 restaurants - was being sold to David Davoudpour, founder and CEO of the Atlanta-based Royal Capital Corporation, the largest franchisee of Church's Chicken restaurants. At the time of purchase, there were 61 corporate owned stores. Davoudpour began purchasing franchisee locations and rebranding the restaurants, including offering new menu items and upgrades to individual locations.\n\nIn January 2014, Shoney's opened a location in Sugarloaf Mills in Lawrenceville, Georgia. The restaurant served as a prototype for the company brand, offering alcohol service and being the company's first mall-based location. At the time of the opening, Shoney's operated 165 restaurants in 16 states. In 2017, the chain began modernizing locations with a contemporary look. As of 2019, Shoney's operates locations in 17 states. It also has \"Shoney's On The Go\" for takeout orders which is used in smaller locations such as malls and airports.\n\nShoney's is a family casual restaurant, offering traditional American-style food such as hamburgers, chicken, steaks, fish, sandwiches, salads and desserts. Some of its iconic menu items include its hot fudge cake and strawberry pie. Shoney's also became known for its breakfast bar beginning in the 1980s. It offers full-menu dining service with some locations having buffets and alcohol service.\n\nIn 1975, the restaurant chain founded Shoney's Inn, a motel chain. After the motels were sold off in 1991, Shoney's continued to collect royalties on the name. Between 2002 and 2006, the last remaining Shoney's Inns were re-branded as GuestHouse.\n\n"}

The title is a reference to the traditional German folk tale, \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\".\n\nThe story concerns a 70-year-old Englishman, John Sidney Howard, who goes on a fishing holiday in Jura, France partly to recover from grief at the loss of his son during the Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Although the \nSecond World War has begun, he does not expect the speed with which the Nazi German forces invade France. His urgent desire to return home is delayed by a request made by an English couple he meets at the hotel. They ask him to take their two young children to England and safety. While delayed in Dijon by the sudden illness of one of the children, he accepts a request by one of the hotel maids to also take her young niece to safety in England where the child's father is working. Along the way, Howard accepts two more children: a boy whose parents were killed on the road by German aircraft, and a Dutch boy who is being attacked by panicking French villagers who mistake him for a German. Along the way he is overtaken by events and turns for help to some acquaintances in Chartres whom he barely knows, but remembers from a skiing holiday he took with his son, some years before.\n\nEventually, Howard and the children reach Brittany, hoping to escape Nazi-occupied France on a fishing boat. However, when one of the children is overheard speaking in English, the Nazis discover that Howard is an enemy Englishman and arrest him. He is accused of being a spy and threatened with death by the Gestapo, but in a final plot twist, the German commandant secretly allows Howard and the children to sail to England on the condition that they take his niece with them and send her to her uncle in the United States. His niece is apparently orphaned and had a \"non-Aryan\" mother.\n\nThe hazardous boat trip from France to England is successful and, ultimately, all the children are repatriated to the USA where they are cared for by Howard's daughter.\n\nThe tale is told in the form of a flashback by Howard to an acquaintance he meets in a London club during the Blitz.\n\nThe story was filmed in 1942 and again in 1990 as a CBS made-for-television film, \"Crossing to Freedom\". Howard was played in the 1942 film by Monty Woolley and by Peter O'Toole in the 1990 film.\n"}

His early education seems to have been meagre before he joined the London and North Western Railway, probably in some clerical capacity. Somewhere around 1855, he was appointed a goods agent for the railway and relocated to Smethwick where his job led to a network of industrial contacts including Thomas Astbury (1810–1862) who introduced him to Francis Watkins. In 1858, Keen married Astbury's daughter, Hannah. The couple were to go on to parent ten children in half a century of family life in Edgbaston.\n\nWatkins was trying to market his patent nut-making machine in England and Keen saw the potential of the business. The firm of \"Watkins and Keen\" was established with capital from Astbury. The firm prospered and in 1864 was launched as a limited company, Watkins retiring a few years later. Keen continued to expand the business through a series of astute mergers and acquisitions. Keen's objective was to establish himself as the market leader in fasteners through aggressive pricing and economies of scale.\n\nThough he modelled his approach on that of another Birmingham firm, \"Nettlefold and Chamberlain\", he achieved less success, possibly being less ruthless and embedded in a more complicated market segment.\n\nIn 1899, Keen bought the Dowlais Iron Company for £1.5 million from Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, forming \"Guest, Keen & Co.\" (\"GK\"). At this point, Keen's facility for takeover seems to have faltered with a series of aborted mergers, including one proposed with United States Steel Corporation. However, in 1902, he completed a merger with the neighbouring business of Nettlefolds Limited to create \"Guest, Keen and Nettlefold\" (\"GKN\").\n\nGKN was an enormously profitable business and Keen was held in high regard. Much of the business's profitability stemmed from a successful policy of price maintenance through the \"Birmingham Alliance\" that he forged with trade unionist Richard Juggins and which was realised in the midland iron and steel wages board. He became a director of the Birmingham and Midland Bank in 1880 and led the series of mergers that established it as the London, City, and Midland Bank.\n\nKeen made extensive contributions to civil society, including twenty-five years on the Smethwick board of health, service as one of Staffordshire County Council's first aldermen and work with Joseph Chamberlain on the foundation of the University of Birmingham.\n\nThough a Liberal, he opposed home rule and was active in the Liberal Unionist cause. He supported Chamberlain's tariff reforms and served as part of the iron and steel commission. Though called upon, he declined to stand for Parliament.\n\n\n"}

Lucas was adopted when he was eight months old by a conservative Pennsylvania couple. His father was an FBI agent; his mother was a painter. She was born Jewish but suppressed the identity, which Lucas relates in his storytelling. He graduated in 1969 from Conestoga High School in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lucas became interested in the political left and discovered an attraction toward men. He is openly gay, and recalls that his coming out made it possible for him to develop as a playwright and as a person.\n\nIn 1973, Lucas left Boston University with a Bachelor of Arts in theatre and creative writing. His mentor Anne Sexton urged him to move to New York City to become a playwright. He worked in many day jobs while performing in Broadway musicals including \"Shenandoah\", \"On the Twentieth Century\", \"Rex\", and \"Sweeney Todd\". Stephen Sondheim later told him he was a better writer than actor.\n\nLucas met Norman René in 1979. Their first collaboration was \"Marry Me a Little\" in 1981. The two wrote a script incorporating songs that had been written for but discarded from Stephen Sondheim musicals, and René also directed. They followed this with the plays \"Missing Persons\" (1981) and \"Blue Window\" (1984); \"Three Postcards\" (1987), an original music by Lucas and Craig Carnelia; and another play, \"Reckless\" (1983). In 1990, they had their biggest commercial and critical success with \"Prelude to a Kiss\". They also collaborated for the feature film \"Longtime Companion\" (1990), the 1992 film adaptation of \"Prelude to a Kiss\" with Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan, and the 1995 film version of \"Reckless\" with Mia Farrow and Mary-Louise Parker.\n\nFollowing his early work on romantic comedies, Lucas began to write more serious works about AIDS, including \"The Singing Forest\" (not to be confused with the film of the same name) and \"The Dying Gaul,\" the latter of which was made into a film that Lucas also directed. Lucas also wrote the book for the musical \"The Light in the Piazza\", and directed the world premiere at the Intiman Theater in Seattle. The Lincoln Center production, directed by Bartlett Sher, garnered him a Tony Award nomination.\n\nLucas has also directed plays such as \"Loot\". He directed \"Birds of America\", a film starring Matthew Perry and Hilary Swank, in 2007.\n\nLucas's play \"Prayer for My Enemy\" premiered Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in December 2008. The production was directed by Lucas's frequent collaborator Bartlett Sher and featured Victoria Clark, Michele Pawk and Jonathan Groff. The play ran from November 14 (previews) through December 21.\n\nIn June 2013, Melbourne's Regent Theatre hosted the world premiere (and Broadway try-out) of \"King Kong\", for which Lucas has provided the book with a score by Marius de Vries. As of 2014, Lucas is no longer involved with this musical.\n\n\"Amélie\", a musical based on the award-winning film of 2001, premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre (Berkeley, California) In September 2015, with a book by Lucas, music by Daniel Messé (of Hem), lyrics by Nathan Tysen and Messé, and directed by Pam MacKinnon. The production had its pre-Broadway engagement at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. It transferred to Broadway, starting previews on March 9, 2017 and closing on May 21, 2017, after 27 previews and 56 regular performances.\n\nIn 2001 Lucas received an Obie Award for his direction of Harry Kondoleon's \"Saved or Destroyed\" at the Rattlestick Theater. He won the 2003 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay for \"The Secret Lives of Dentists\". His \"Small Tragedy\" was awarded an Obie as Best American Play in 2004. Lucas's other awards include the Excellence in Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award; and Outer Critics Circle, L.A. Drama Critics Circle, Drama-Logue and Lambda Literary Awards.\n\nFellowships include those from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller Foundations, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nHe has received the Tony Award nomination for the books of: \"An American in Paris\" (2015), \"Light in the Piazza\" (2005) and \"Prelude to a Kiss\".

In August 2012 JK & Joel confirmed they had split.\n\nThe two first worked together at Viking FM in Kingston upon Hull from 1996 when Ross joined the station from Yorkshire Coast Radio to present the overnight programme. King was hosting the afternoon show at the time. In 1998 King took over the breakfast show and Ross, who was on the afternoon programme, later began reading the travel bulletins on the show, as a punishment for turning up late. Despite not getting along at first (King heatbutted Ross, breaking his nose), eventually the two were paired up as co-hosts and together they won two Gold Sony Radio Academy Awards for 'Breakfast Show Of The Year' and a Silver for 'Entertainment Show'.\n\nThey left Viking FM to join Key 103 in Manchester in 2000, taking over from Mike Toolan as hosts of the breakfast show where they won a further 3 Sony radio awards, Gold for UK best breakfast show, Silver for UK's best presenters and Bronze for the competition award.

He had an early ambition to be a television news broadcaster and started his career in Cedar Rapids, Iowa at KCRG, working as a news anchor and occasionally doing the weather. \n\nIn the early 1970s, he began working as a full-time meteorologist at KOA-TV in Denver, Colorado, and spent several years in the city. In 1976, he went to work in Corpus Christi and then back to KMTV in Omaha. In 1980, he left Omaha to begin his tenure at then-ABC affiliate (now CBS affiliate) WTSP-TV as chief meteorologist on March 17, 1980, replacing WTSP's chief meteorologist, Wally Kinnan. After his death, he relinquished the role to WTSP meteorologist Tammie Souza. He was a former member (1987–1993) of the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council. \n\nDuring his lengthy broadcasting career, Fletcher flew aboard reconnaissance aircraft missions into three hurricanes and made 15 different penetrations into the eyes of those storms. In 1987, he was honored by the American Meteorological Society with an award for Outstanding Service by a Broadcast Meteorologist. He was presented the distinguished service award by the National Hurricane Conference in 2003 for his leadership efforts in hurricane preparedness. He also received the Media award from the Florida Governor's Hurricane Conference in 1993.\nDuring the 2004 hurricane season, Hurricane Charley appeared to be on its way to Tampa Bay. WTSP's studios on Gandy Boulevard, merely two miles west of the Gandy Bridge, were part of the evacuation zone, and the entire staff was forced to leave. The station evacuated to the Clearwater studios of \"Pinellas 18\" (now \"PCC-TV\"), a government access (GATV) cable TV channel owned by Pinellas County. This left Fletcher without his weather equipment, and he was the last to know about the sudden eastward shift of the storm as a result. He was forced to broadcast out of Pinellas 18's ill-equipped studios using a Windows PC with a basic radar image as his makeshift weather station. He was visibly upset on the air as the Windows screensaver repeatedly activated.\n\nHe lived in St. Petersburg with his wife, Cindy, and had three adult children. Fletcher was an avid tennis player, often playing in the morning at the St. Petersburg Tennis Center. He was also an avid baseball fan.\n\nOn November 24, 2003, Fletcher suffered a stroke at the TV station just before a 4 p.m. news broadcast. Subsequent to his first stroke, he made frequent public appearances for the cause of stroke survival and prevention.\n\nOn February 18, 2008, Fletcher suffered a second massive stroke while at home. He subsequently died at St. Anthony's Hospital in St. Petersburg early on the morning of February 26, 2008.\n\n"}

He was one of the founders of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party which was in power in the 1990s and one of its key figures until a split in 2006. In 2009 he was found guilty for war crimes.\n\nGlavaš came to prominence in his home city of Osijek in eastern Croatia during the 1991–95 war of independence when he led its defense and attained the rank of major general in the Croatian Army. After the war he continued to exercise much influence as one of the leading members of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).\n\nIn 2005, Glavaš was charged with war crimes at a Croatian court; he left HDZ and founded a new party – the Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB). After a lengthy and controversial trial, during which he was re-elected to parliament and had to be stripped of immunity twice, in 2009 he was found guilty of torture and murder of Serb civilians in Osijek during the war, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Zagreb County Court. He then fled to neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina where he was arrested. In September 2010, his conviction was upheld by a Bosnian court, though the sentence had been reduced to 8 years in prison. On 20 January 2015, after serving five years in prison, he was released from prison, after Croatia's Constitutional Court rescinded his war crimes conviction on procedural grounds. His case was sent back to the Supreme Court for retrial. In July 2016, the Supreme Court quashed his verdict and ordered a retrial.\n\nGlavaš' father Ljubomir and his mother Zorka (née Pandžić), were born in Drinovci, Grude (present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina) and moved to Osijek in 1949. He attended gymnasium in his home town of Osijek and graduated from the Faculty of Law of the University of Osijek. In 1990 Glavaš was one of the founders of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and one of the most prominent members of that party in Slavonia. In the same year he was elected to the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) and later became part of the last Croatian delegation in the House of Republics and Provinces of the Yugoslav Federal Assembly.\n\nWhen the tensions between the new Croatian government and Croatia's ethnic Serb minority began to escalate, Glavaš emerged as one of the most militant Croatian politicians, earning the reputation of a maverick. From 12 October 1990 until 24 April 1992 he was secretary of the Secretariat for Defense of the Osijek municipality (\"Sekretarijat za narodnu obranu općine Osijek\"), becoming one of the most important officials in charge of defending Osijek and Slavonia.\n\nOn 2 November 1991, with Croatian War of Independence already in progress, he was appointed assistant to the commander for the defence of Osijek in charge of territorial co-ordination and public relations. On 1 December 1991 he was appointed to the rank of major (\"bojnik\") and on 7 December 1991 he was appointed commander of defence for Osijek. In April 1992, after the Command for the defence of Osijek was dissolved, he was named Assistant to the Commander of First Operation Zone, Osijek.\n\nAfter demobilisation, on 30 May 1992, he was elected president of Executive council of the Osijek municipality Assembly. At the February 1993 elections he was elected delegate to the Chamber of Counties (\"Županijski dom Sabora\"), and on 14 April 1993 he became the first prefect (\"župan\") of the Osijek-Baranja County.\n\nOver time, Glavaš developed a rivalry with the Osijek mayor Zlatko Kramarić, who was his opposite in everything—from politics to style. After the 1993 local elections, Kramarić came to power in Osijek, but Glavaš and his HDZ kept the rest of the Osijek-Baranja county. In that period Glavaš surprised many by offering agricultural subsidies to ethnic Serb citizens in then-occupied sections of eastern Slavonia, and explaining that he would be \"first in peace just as he was first in war\".\n\nAt the October 1995 elections he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives (\"Zastupnički dom Sabora\"), then he was re-elected to the Chamber of Counties at the April 1997 elections, and in May 1997 he was also reelected prefect of the Osijek-Baranja County.\n\nIn October 1997 he was named the Inspector of the Croatian Army (\"Inspektor Hrvatske Vojske\") at the Inspectorate General of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia (\"Glavna Inspekcija Oružanih Snaga Republike Hrvatske\"), Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Croatia. In February 1999, he returned to his county political office, where he remained until the end of June 2000.\n\nIn November 1997, he petitioned the authorities to recognize his partial disability, caused by a broken rib injury he sustained while driving near Bjelovar in January 1992. He was later temporarily stripped of the disabled veteran status, until it was reinstated by a court order.\n\nHe was reelected to the Croatian Parliament in the January 2000 elections.\n\nGlavaš maintained a tight grip on power and eastern Slavonia remained an HDZ stronghold even after the death of Franjo Tuđman and his party's loss of power at the national level in 2000. In 2002, when hardliner Ivić Pašalić challenged the more moderate HDZ leader Ivo Sanader for party leadership, Glavaš, despite his own hardline credentials, decided to support Sanader. In the crucial HDZ convention, this endorsement helped Sanader to remain the party chairman.\n\nA year later, the HDZ won the November 2003 parliamentary election and Sanader became prime minister, with Glavaš as one of his most important allies. Glavaš was reelected to Parliament in the same election.\n\nAs time went by and Ivo Sanader's policies became less popular, and there were apparent setbacks for Croatia's prospects for entry into the EU, so Glavaš began to publicly distance himself from Sanader. Glavaš expressed Euroscepticism with regard to how the EU would handle the Croatian accession negotiations, and was critical towards the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\n\nThis process escalated a few days before the start of local elections in May 2005. Glavaš proclaimed himself to be a regionalist and began to advocate regional reorganisation of Croatia, founding a political organisation with that aim. On 20 April 2005, the programme of the \"Hrvatski demokratski sabor Slavonije i Baranje\" - Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja - was first published. Glavaš was immediately ejected from the HDZ the following day but not before persuading almost the entire membership of his local party to support his project and new electoral ticket.\n\nIn the 2005 Croatian local elections, his list of independent candidates won a relative majority in Osijek and Osijek-Baranja County. This prompted Kramarić to approach all other parties in Osijek and attempt to form a broad anti-Glavaš coalition, an offer which was accepted and resulted in HDZ loyalists being allied with the likes of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. In June 2005 Glavaš defeated this scheme, first by allying with the far-right Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), in a coalition that gave the HSP the mayoral position in Osijek for the first time; and then by persuading some assemblymen of the anti-Glavaš coalition to support his candidates in inaugural sessions of the Osijek-Baranja county and City of Osijek assembly.\n\nOn 21 May 2005 Glavaš and his supporters founded a new political party - \"Hrvatski demokratski savez Slavonije i Baranje\" - the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja.\n\nIn July 2005, Glavaš was publicly implicated in the 1991 murders of Serb civilians in Osijek. In May 2006 Croatian chief prosecutor Mladen Bajić asked the Croatian Parliament to deprive Glavaš of his parliamentary immunity, in order to start formal criminal proceedings in the case. On 10 May, this request was granted.\n\nDuring the proceedings, prosecutors failed twice in their attempts to have Glavaš arrested, because investigative magistrates and local courts rejected their demands to issue arrest warrants. However, on 23 October one investigative magistrate issued an arrest warrant, which was approved by the Mandate-Immunity Committee of Croatian Parliament after four days of dramatic and confusing deliberations. Glavaš was arrested on 26 October and put in jail for fear that he might influence witnesses if he was bailed.\n\nOsijek's investigative judge Mario Kovac ruled that the case against Glavaš could begin. Glavaš subsequently went on hunger strike. On 2 December 2006, Glavaš was released from custody pending his trial, bringing to an end his 37-day hunger strike. The investigating judge had ruled that Glavaš was too ill to attend legal hearings, and investigations were suspended. On 8 February 2007, the case against Glavas was reopened.\n\nGlavaš was re-indicted on 16 April 2007 at the county court in Osijek, on charges of having given orders to members of a unit under his command to abduct, torture and murder Serbs in late 1991. Following the indictment, he was returned to custody. He started a second hunger strike on 27 April. On 9 May, a second indictment was brought against him on charges of ordering the torture and killing of at least two Serb civilians. His trial began in Osijek on 15 October 2007.\n\nIn the Croatian elections of 25 November 2007, Glavaš was re-elected to parliament. This restored his immunity, and he was released from detention. On 14 July 2008, the trial was adjourned until September 2008 because of the purported poor health of one of Glavaš's co-accused. Under Croatian law, as there was a break of more than two months in the trial, there had to be a retrial.\n\nGlavaš and his supporters claimed the criminal investigation was politically motivated and pointed to its commencement having coincided with Glavaš's departure from the ruling HDZ party. It was also reported that witnesses in the trial, including Osijek-based journalist Drago Hedl, had been threatened.\n\nOn 8 May 2009 the Zagreb District Court found Glavaš guilty of torture and murder of Serbian civilians in Osijek, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. However, Vladimir Šišljagić, the leader of HDSSB, the political party Glavaš founded when he left HDZ, showed up in court instead of him and stated that he was \"in a safe place\". Glavaš fled the country, reportedly to Herzegovina, having procured citizenship in Bosnia-Herzegovina seven months earlier.\n\nGlavaš was arrested near the Bosnian town of Kupres on 13 May 2009. The Croatian Ministry of Justice filed a request for his extradition but this was rejected on 23 June 2009. In June 2010, the Supreme Court of Croatia confirmed the guilty verdict for Glavaš and others, but reduced the sentence slightly, to eight years of prison.\n\nThe verdict caused his membership in the Parliament to be automatically rescinded, together with the immunity and other privileges he continued to enjoy up to it. The parliamentary committee subsequently decided that his mandate ended with the day of the final verdict, 2 May 2010, a decision he publicly appealed saying they owe him one salary.\nAnother scandal arose after it was discovered that prominent members of Glavaš' political party had participated in a plot to bribe members of the Supreme Court to show him leniency.\n\nBased upon the agreement of mutual execution of criminal sanctions between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed the second-instance verdict and Glavaš was arrested in Drinovci on 28 September 2010.\n\nDue to his contribution during Croatian War of Independence Glavaš was rewarded with several medals:\n\nAfter his war crimes conviction, the revocation of these decorations was an oft-mentioned topic in the media, and both Croatian Presidents Mesić and Josipović said that they would handle the issue according to the law which states that illegal and immoral acts are grounds for revocation.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court verdict, President Josipović formally took away the decorations, but not before Glavaš claimed to the media that he had sold his medals. Josipović responded by stating that the metal insignia can be dealt with whichever way one wishes to deal with them, but that the moral content of the honor is bestowed by the President of the Republic.\n\nIn August 2010, President Josipović also said that Glavaš would enter a military procedure for his rank of general to be rescinded, according to a law that says officers who are given a prolonged prison sentence (over three years) lose their rank. A month later, he issued a decision to that effect for Mirko Norac, Vladimir Zagorec, Tihomir Orešković and Siniša Rimac also.\n\nHe was incarcerated in the southern Bosnian town of Mostar. On 20 January 2015, after serving five years in prison, he was released from prison, after Croatia's Constitutional Court rescinded his war crimes conviction on procedural grounds. The case was sent back to the Supreme Court for a retrial. He is the highest ranking Croatian official convicted for war crimes by local judiciary.\n\n"}

In practice, the unpredictable availability of time slots makes this difficult to implement. However, reducing interference is a significant component in how GSM and other TDMA based mobile phone systems make better use of the available spectrum compared to older analog systems such as AMPS and NMT. While older network types theoretically allocated two 25–30 kHz channels per conversation, in practice some radios would cause interference on neighbouring channels making them unusable, and a single radio may broadcast too strong an oval signal pattern to let nearby cells reuse the same channel.\n\nGSM combines short packet sizes, frequency hopping, redundancy, power control, digital encoding, and DTX to minimize interference and the effects of interference on a conversation. In this respect, DTX indirectly improves the over-all capacity of a network.\n\nIn packet radio systems such as GPRS/EDGE, it is possible to combine DTX with capacity increase when VoIP is used for telephony. In such cases, resources freed up when one user is in silence can be used to serve another user. The increase of the number of users will contribute to the interference level. Systems that use voice codecs such as AMR can reduce vocoder rate adaptively to better combat interference. \n\nSystems based upon CDMA air interfaces such as IS-95/CDMA2000, and most forms of UMTS, can use a form of implied DTX by usage of a variable rate codec such as AMR. As with the packet radio systems above, when one side of the conversion is silent, the amount of transmitted data is minimized. Again, the effect is reduced interference.\n\nIn wireless transmitters, VAD is sometimes called voice-operated transmission (VOX).\n\n\nSpeech frame = 260 samples\n\nPerforms SP flag monitoring and Channel coding\n\nAfter the transition from VAD=1 to VAD=0, a \"hangover period\" of N+1 consecutive frames is required to make a new updated SID frame available. The bursts are directly passed to RSS with SP=1.\n\nBackground noise spikes can often be confused with the speech frame and hence, in order to nullify this issue, a check list for SID computation is Nelapsed >23, old SID is utilized with VAD=0.\n\nOnce after the end of speech SID is computed it is continuously passed to the RSS marked with SP=0 as long as VAD=0.\n\nIf a SID (SP=0) is chosen for transmission is stolen for FACCH signaling than the subsequent frame is scheduled for transmission.\n\n\nA FACCH frame in not considered as a meaningful information and should be transmitted with BFI=1\n\nTraffic frames aligned with SACCH multi frame have TAF (time alignment flag)=1 \n\nRX DTX handler performs speech decoding and comfort noise computation.\n\nPerforms Error Correction and Detection and SID frame detection\n\nWhenever a good speech frame is detected the RX DTX handler shall pass directly to speech decoder.\nWhenever a lost speech or lost SID frames are detected the substitution or mutation shall be applied.\nWhenever a valid SID frame result in comfort noise generation.\nIn case of invalid SID frame after consecutive Speech frames the last valid SID frame will be applicable.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 12, 1995. In the episode, Homer becomes a Krusty the Clown impersonator, but is mistaken for the real Krusty by the Springfield Mafia. Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, while Dick Cavett and Johnny Unitas guest starred as themselves.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by David Silverman. Swartzwelder's script required very little rewriting and Silverman considers this one of the best episodes he has directed. He later used it to help him when directing \"The Simpsons Movie\". One dropped storyline for \"The Simpsons\" saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity and this episode allowed writers to comment upon the similarity of the two characters' design. The episode features references to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", \"The Godfather\", and \"The Maltese Falcon\".\n\nKrusty's gambling debts and spendthrifting land him in deep trouble with the Springfield Mafia. To make more money, he launches a training college for clowns, where Homer enrolls. After graduating, he impersonates Krusty at events that the real Krusty deems beneath him, such as children's birthday parties and the unveiling of a new sandwich at Krusty Burger.\n\nThe stress of impersonating Krusty makes Homer consider quitting. He soon discovers his uncanny resemblance to the clown has its benefits: Chief Wiggum rips up a speeding ticket when he mistakes Homer for Krusty, and Apu gives him a discount at the Kwik-E-Mart.\n\nImpersonating Krusty also has its pitfalls: Homer is kidnapped by the Mafia when they mistake him for Krusty, who owes them money. Don Vittorio DiMaggio tells Homer he will kill him unless he performs a loop-de-loop on a tiny bicycle, the only trick Homer never could master at clown college. After he fails to perform the stunt to DiMaggio's satisfaction, the Mafioso is deeply offended.\n\nSoon the real Krusty arrives and the confused DiMaggio forces them to perform the stunt together on the same tiny bicycle. The trick is a success and their lives are spared, but Krusty still has to pay off his $48 gambling debt to the Mob. Krusty pays DiMaggio with a $50 bill and the Mob boss gives him $2 in change.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by David Silverman. Swartzwelder came up with the idea and his script required very little rewriting. The episode is one of Silverman's favorites and he was pleased to direct it, after enjoying Swartzwelder's script. Silverman felt he himself \"brought a lot to the party on [this] one\", and although \"people didn't like [Swartzwelder's script] at the read-through\", Silverman thought \"the script was really funny, and I had an idea for the opening and presented it with a lot of circus music that inspired the music they used for it. It was great fun.\" He used it, along with \"Three Men and a Comic Book\", to help him when directing \"The Simpsons Movie\".\n\nBrad Bird also helped Silverman, particularly with Krusty's design. An early idea for \"The Simpsons\" saw Krusty the Clown being revealed as Homer Simpson's secret stage identity. This storyline never developed, but this episode allowed writers to comment upon the design similarity of the two characters. Krusty's appearance and design is just that of Homer's, with clown make-up. Silverman enhanced the lines under Krusty's eyes, and reshaped his beard line in order to make a clearer distinction between the two characters.\n\nHomer beating up the Estonian dwarf (who first appeared in \"Burns' Heir\") was a joke Matt Groening \"had trouble with\". David Mirkin wanted the scene to be violent, but Silverman stated that he thought he had animated the finished product to be too realistic. However, nothing was changed. Fox objected to the mafia buying ammunition from a Big 5 Sporting Goods until Mirkin pointed out that Big 5 sold ammunition. The second act break was, up until the animatic, after Fat Tony's line \"cancel the world search\".\n\nJoe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony. Mirkin said Mantegna is a joy to direct and that Mantegna loves the role so much, he wishes to voice him \"even if he only coughs\". Dick Cavett guest-starred as himself. Mirkin commented that Cavett's part was probably the \"meanest\" they had ever been to a guest star. Cavett often told stories involving himself and other famous people and Mirkin decided to make light of that. Cavett did not have any objections.\n\nThe episode's title is reference to the character Homey D. Clown from the sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\". Krusty lights a cigarette with an issue of \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, and one of the rarest comic books of all time, while Homer forms his mashed potatoes into a circus tent in a parody of Richard Dreyfuss' character forming his potatoes into a replica of Devils Tower in the 1977 film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". The episode contains several references to films related to organized crime, such as the notes played on the wine glasses during Homer and Krusty's bicycle trick forming those of the theme from the film \"The Godfather\". Additionally, Silverman inserted a low-angle shot of Fat Tony sitting in a chair as a tribute to a similar shot of Sydney Greenstreet's character in \"The Maltese Falcon\", while Don Vittorio is based on actors William Hickey and Don Ameche.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Homie the Clown\" finished 59th (tied with \"Behind Closed Doors II\") in the ratings for the week of February 5 to February 12, 1995, helping Fox to an overall Nielsen rating of 7.9. The episode was the fifth highest rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", stated the episode was \"notable for its scenes of Homer on trying to emulate Krusty's mini-trike loop the loops\". Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict felt it \"features one of the more amusing stunts to cap an episode\", giving it an A. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD that the episode \"offers a truly terrific show\", and praised the \"clever \"Close Encounters\" reference, and the ways that it ties together Krusty's mob connection with Homer\", concluding \"it's a real winner\".\n\nMike Brantley of \"The Mobile Register\" named \"Homie the Clown\" the 48th greatest television episode of all-time. When \"The Simpsons\" began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former \"Simpsons\" writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service.\n\n"}

This treaty was a smaller follow-up treaty to that of the Treaty of Roskilde, which decisively delineated the mutually recognized boundaries of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway; boundaries which are almost exactly the same to this day.\n\nCharles X of Sweden would not accept any other outcome than Sweden's receipt of Akershus county, in exchange for the return of Trøndelag and Bornholm to Denmark-Norway; Frederick III of Denmark on the other hand refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde, instead wanting to revert to the conditions of the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645). Both kings were stubborn, and had to depend on the mediating powers, France and England on the Swedish side, and the Dutch Republic on the Danish side, to bring about a treaty.\n\nFrederick argued to his Dutch allies that Swedish control of Scania would present an eternal lingering threat to Copenhagen, and proposed a Danish-Dutch alliance to retake Scania. Frederick had the support of Brandenburg and Austria, but the Dutch had already agreed with England that preventing the western and eastern shore of Øresund from being controlled by the same country would in turn prevent future raises of the Øresund toll, which would cause disruption in the Dutch and English Baltic trade. In addition, Cardinal Jules Mazarin threatened a French invasion of the Netherlands if it were to assist Denmark against Sweden.\n\nWhen learning of Charles' death in February 1660, Frederick immediately proclaimed the Treaty of Roskilde null and void. This caused great alarm to the Swedish mediators, but their French and English counterparts assured them that if Sweden were to yield their claim to Trøndelag but otherwise stick by the terms of Roskilde, France and England would assure a treaty under those conditions. Denmark insisted on the return of the Scanian lands, with the support of Brandenburg, Austria and Poland, but this time the Dutch did not agree with Denmark. On 8 March 1660, admiral Michiel de Ruyter and his Dutch fleet were ordered to leave the harbour of Landskrona, where he had bottled up the Swedish fleet. Frederick yielded, and the negotiations began in earnest on 24 March.\n\nThe most contentious point was regarding the control of the island of Bornholm. The people of Bornholm had risen against their Swedish occupants, and killed the Swedish commander, Johan Printzensköld. They now feared retribution, were the island to remain in Swedish hands. Frederick had given his word of honour to protect his faithful subjects to the utmost; he kept his promise by demanding the return of Bornholm to Denmark despite the threats of Sweden and the negotiating powers. It was then suggested that Denmark would provide compensation by ceding several estates held by Danish noble families in Scania to the crown of Sweden.\n\nAt this point, however, the negotiations started to derail as the mediating countries' representatives became involved in intrigues that weren't in the interests of their client states. Exasperated by the slow progress of the negotiations, Hannibal Sehested suggested that negotiations should proceed directly between Denmark and Sweden. The suggestion was accepted by the Swedes, and in a few days the conditions of the treaty were agreed upon.\n\nOn 27 May, the treaty was signed in the tents that had been erected halfway between Copenhagen and the fortified Swedish camp of Carlstad. Four days later the remnants of the Swedish army in Zealand, now numbering 3,000, finally began leaving the outskirts of Copenhagen.\n\nThe terms of the treaty were as follows:\n\n\n"}

It aims to provide a 'counterbalance' to the academic rigour of the educational programme. Before the 2010 examination there was a 150-hour requirement, with an approximately equal distribution of creativity, activity, and service. This requirement was removed mainly for two reasons: to ensure that students engage in meaningful activities and to decrease the amount of CAS fraud (i.e. claiming hours which have not been completed). Students are now expected to have two CAS activities for each CAS category and students need to prove that they are participating in CAS activities on a weekly basis (though not necessarily all CAS categories each week). Moreover, students must have one CAS project which spans at least a month. Finally one must prove that the CAS activities have resulted in the seven projected outcomes of CAS (one CAS activity can have multiple outcomes).\n\n\nThe function of CAS is to allow IB schools the opportunity to \"give students the means to learn through experience [and] how to take actions in the service of others.\"\n\nAll the portions (creativity, action, and service) are vaguely defined and should, according to the International Baccalaureate Organisation, be interpreted as imaginatively as possible, so that a wide array of different activities can qualify for CAS. The learning outcomes and the quality of the CAS activity are of utmost importance.\n\nWhile individual schools or regions have different methods of documentation, all require some form of proof or the signature of the activity coordinator to be presented after completion of the activity. Students must also personally keep track of their total records in either a log or \"diary\" format. This allows for students to monitor their required hours and to present a coherent documentation of their entire CAS experience.\n\nCAS performance and records are documented by the student using official forms (CAS/CP) that are submitted to the IB regional offices at the beginning of the examination session.\n\nCAS is internally assessed. However, IBO can ask for a number of random samples to be submitted. A failure to complete and provide evidence for completion is considered a failing condition for the entire Diploma (although candidates are given another year to finish their CAS program if they fail, and if they complete it in this time they will receive their diploma).\n\n"}

He is best known as the host of the weekday breakfast show on the London-based radio station LBC and, with 1.3 million daily listeners, is currently the most-listened-to host on LBC . He also has a regular column in the \"Sunday Express\" and was previously a regular guest on \"The Alan Titchmarsh Show\". He regularly appears on ITV's programme \"This Morning\" and has presented the Sky News debate show \"The Pledge\" since 2016.\n\nHis father, Lino \"Dan\" Ferrari,\nran a news agency, \"Ferrari Press Agency\", and Nick was keen to work in the media himself. According to \"The Independent\", \"The Evening Standard\", \"The Guardian\" and the \"Guide to Independent Schools\", he was educated at Eltham College,a private school for boys in Mottingham in southeast London. \n\nDespite a keen interest in journalism, Ferrari initially wanted to become a vet and only changed career path after meeting Norman Scott through his father. He later turned down the option to study at Cambridge to join a local newspaper.\n\nFerrari became a news reporter on the \"Sunday Mirror\"\nin 1981 and subsequently a show business reporter at \"The Sun\" and editor of the paper's \"Bizarre\" gossip page. During this period, he interviewed Roger Moore on the set of the James Bond film \"Octopussy\" for \"The Sun\" and appeared as an extra in the movie. Subsequently he became features editor of the \"News of the World\"'s \"Sunday\" magazine and assistant editor of the \"Daily Mirror\".\nA friend of former \"The Sun\" editor Kelvin MacKenzie, Ferrari joined him at L!VE TV\nwhere he devised such programmes as \"Topless Darts\", the News Bunny and the weather presented by a dwarf on a trampoline.\n\nFerrari joined Talk Radio in 1999 as co-presenter of the \"Big Boys' Breakfast\" show with David Banks., shortly after the station was purchased by former colleague Kelvin MacKenzie in 1998. The show was scheduled between 6am and 9am and focused on entertainment rather than news content. In late 1999 it was announced that the show would be cancelled as part of the relaunch of Talk Radio as Talk Sport to focus entirely on sports content.\n\nIn 2001 Ferrari presented his first breakfast programme on LBC, taking on the role officially in 2004. The programme runs from 7am to 10am and takes the format of a news and political debate and discussion show with the presenter introducing topics and then discussing them with both members of the public and experts, through text messaging, email and phone, with the last of the three being the main mode of contact. The programme mixes both light entertainment stories and more serious topics in the news. Ferrari frequently asks first-time callers which station they previously listened to, rejoicing when they have deserted BBC Radio 4, BBC London 94.9 or rival station Capital FM. Ferrari is also known for deliberately not mentioning the phone number to call the programme whilst presenting as he believes it is an unnatural way to speak to listeners.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2017 General Election an interview with Diane Abbott on Ferrari's show made national headlines after she struggled to provide figures for police policy. When questioned on the policy Abbott stated 10,000 police officers would cost £300,000, before correcting herself to £80 million. Ferrari questioned further on this figure and pointed out that it would only allow for paying each police officer £8,000. In a subsequent article Ferrari stated that he had banned Dianne Abbott from his show due to her failing to appear for previous scheduled interviews and had only allowed her to feature to aid the balance of subjects interviewed on the programme. Later the same day the BBC's \"The Daily Politics\" replayed the interview to Abbott where she defended her performance, saying: \"I did seven interviews this morning. In that seventh interview I misspoke\". Ferrari was awarded the 2018 IRN Best Interview award for his role in interviewing Diane Abbott where judges praised him for \"[representing] the role of listeners and voters brilliantly\".\n\nThe show received the Sony Breakfast Show of the Year award in 2006 as well as the Arqiva Breakfast Show of the year in 2010. Ferrari was also awarded the Sony Speech Broadcaster of the year in 2009. and the Arqiva Gold Award in 2010 for \"outstanding contribution to the industry over the last twelve months\".\n\nFerrari presented the discussion programme \"Forum\" on Press TV, an Iranian news channel. He quit his show on the station on 30 June 2009 in protest at the reporting of the Iranian presidential election on 12 June 2009. \n\nIn 2006, Ferrari also made an appearance on the BBC/HBO comedy show \"Extras.\"\n\nIt was suggested in June 2006 by Conservative leader David Cameron that, if he joined the Conservative Party and put himself forward, Ferrari could win the ballot to be the party's candidate for Mayor of London. Ferrari indicated, however, that he would not stand, as he \"did not want to leave the listeners\" and joked that he \"couldn't take the pay cut\". Later, he began to see merit in the idea and discussed what policies he might introduce should he become Mayor: amongst these were re-introducing the AEC Routemaster buses (with various modifications so that they would conform to disability and environmental laws) and scrapping the Mercedes-Benz \"Bendy Buses\" and, more controversially, putting a large levy on trainers in the run-up to the 2012 Olympic Games and doubling income tax on Human Rights lawyers. Ferrari later indicated that he would not stand as the Conservative candidate, a role that was taken by Boris Johnson.\n\nFerrari does not recycle because the number of recycle bins mean \"you've lost your front garden\", he said on BBC's \"The Daily Politics\".\n\nFerrari voted to Leave in the 2016 EU membership referendum, but did not agree with the government's settled status fee (which was later scrapped).\n\nIn September 2019, Ferrari said, after a visit to Israel, \"I’d been given an insight into a country that I’ve always admired and I now revered\"\n\nIn 2003, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint against Ferrari, finding that his programme's \"active reinforcement of prejudiced views about asylum seekers had exceeded acceptable boundaries for transmission\". Following this, and at a time of frosty relations between Ferrari and the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, the Mayor wrote to the Managing Director of LBC 97.3 asking what measures had been implemented to ensure the situation would not arise again. Following this, Livingstone appeared regularly on Ferrari's programme to answer questions from listeners.\n\nIn 2015, Ferrari was investigated by Ofcom after he said on his radio programme that the November 2015 Paris attacks were \"a Muslim problem\" and told a Muslim caller to \"go some place else\" if the caller didn't agree with UK foreign policy. Ofcom found Ferrari not in breach of any broadcasting rules, saying \"We found the caller was given an opportunity to rebuke Mr Ferrari's offensive comments, while two other callers also challenged Ferrari in strong terms. In addition, the presenter made clear that he was not characterising all Muslims as extremists or criminals\".\n\nFerrari is a supporter of Leicester City.\n\n"}

It includes mowing grass, trimming hedges, pulling weeds, planting flowers, etc. The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that more than 900,000 workers are employed in the landscape maintenance and groundskeeping services industry in the United States in 2006. Of these over 300,000 workers were greenskeepers for golf courses, schools, resorts, and public parks. Compare gardener.\n\nA groundskeeper is a person who maintains landscaping, gardens or sporting venues (and their vegetation where appropriate) for appearance and functionality. In Britain the word groundsman (occasionally groundswoman if appropriate) or park-keeper is used much more commonly.\nIn Australia, the word curator is often used for a person undertaking this job, especially those involving cricket pitches. At university campuses, groundskeepers are often called horticulturists. The equivalent on a golf course is a greenskeeper.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated in May 2015 that statistical group 37-3011 \"Landscaping and Groundskeeping Workers\" numbered 895,600 with a median annual wage of $25,030. The BLS describes the functions of this group as \"Workers typically perform a variety of tasks, which may include any combination of the following: sod laying, mowing, trimming, planting, watering, fertilizing, digging, raking, sprinkler installation, and installation of mortarless segmental concrete masonry wall units\".\n\nA groundskeeper's job requires a wide range of knowledge of horticulture, pest control, and weed abatement. As many institutions (especially schools) are moving away from the use of chemical pesticides and toward integrated pest management the experience, knowledge and scholastic requirements of top groundskeepers are increasing.

(, , ) was a 16th-century painter in Central Europe in late Gothic and early Renaissance art.\n\nHe was active in Banská Štiavnica (to 1918 Selmecbánya in the Kingdom of Hungary, since 1993 in Slovakia) and probably led a workshop there. Since his true name is unknown, he is sometimes identified with various other Gothic \"masters\". German art historians generally identify him with J. Brieu, a painter from Augsburg. Also some art historians identify him with the engraver Master MZ, often identified as Matthäus Zaisinger (1498–1555), a German goldsmith from Munich. According to other research the master could have been a Hungarian painter called Sebestyén, whose name is mentioned in the charter of Banská Štiavnica in 1507. The art historian Miklós Mojzer noted the similarities between this work and that of the painter who accompanied Veit Stoss and made the passion paintings in an altar now in the Esztergom Christian Museum and he called him Marten Swarcz. His art combining dramatic depth and colourful decorative formation is akin to that of the German painters Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, J. Brieu and mainly Mathias Grünewald.\n\nOnly seven of his panel paintings are known out of eight which used to decorate the high altar of a church in Banská Štiavnica. It was believed that the altar was in the Saint Catherine Church, but according to the new research the pictures were part of the altar in the Virgin Mary Church, later rebuilt into the fortress called the Old Castle. Now there are four Passion paintings in Esztergom,Hungary, in the Christian Museum; the painting \"The Birth of Christ\" is held in Svätý Anton (formerly known also as Hontszentantal) near Banská Štiavnica, and The Adoration of the Magi is in the Museum of Lille in France. His painting entitled \"The Visitation\" depicts the meeting of the two saints, the Virgin Mary and St. Elizabeth, is in Budapest, in the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\nThere are also three more-than-life-size wood-carved polychromed sculptures preserved which originally belong to the same altar.

He graduated from the Page Corps in 1827. He participated in the Siege of Varna in the Russo-Turkish War in 1828–1829, and later in suppression of the November Uprising in Poland in 1831. Due to health reasons, he retired from the military in 1833 and returned home to manage his father's estate. However, he returned to active duty in 1838, as General Golovin's aide-de-camp, to serve in the Caucasus region. During one of the campaigns against the mountain people Muravyov was wounded.\nIn 1840, Muravyov was assigned to command one of the sections of the Black Sea coast defense lines, during which time he participated in the suppression of the Ubykh people.\n\nMuravyov was promoted in rank to major-general in 1841, but had to permanently retire from the military due to illness. He transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was appointed as an acting military and civil governor of Tula province in 1846. Eager in his willingness to improve the province's state of affairs, he proposed to establish the governorate agricultural society. Muravyov was the first governor to propose Tsar Nicholas I to abolish serfdom; a motion signed by nine local land-owners. While the tsar did nothing about the petition, from then on he always referred to Muravyov as a \"liberal\" and a \"democrat\".\n\nOn September 5, 1847, Muravyov was appointed the governor-general of Irkutsk and Yeniseysk (Eastern Siberia). His appointment was a subject of much controversy, as it was unusual for a person of his age (only 38 at the time) to be put in charge of such a vast territory. Contrary to the views of Karl Nesselrode, the Russian Foreign Minister, Muravyov was personally instructed by Tsar Nicholas I to press for an advantage against China. Muravyov's first action as governor-general was to put end to the embezzlement of public funds. He also mandated the study of the Russian language in schools for native Siberian and Far Eastern peoples. He pursued the exploration and settlement of the territories north of the Amur River, often utilizing the help of political exiles. Many of his actions were aimed to expand commerce in the Far Eastern region. Seeing religion as a powerful form of control over the local population, he favored the building of new Christian churches and promoted local religious beliefs such as shamanism and Buddhism.\n\nAfter the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, Russia lost the right to navigate the Amur River. Muravyov insisted on conducting an aggressive policy with China despite strong resistance from St. Petersburg officials, who feared a breakdown in relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, because the lower reaches of the Amur River were, in fact, being claimed by the Russians, several expeditions organized by Gennady Nevelskoy had been approved by the government. In 1851–1853, several expeditions were sent to the Amur Liman and Sakhalin, with Russian settlements being established in those areas.\nOn , Tsar Nicholas I authorized Muravyov to carry the negotiations with the Chinese regarding establishing a border along the Amur River and to transport troops to the Amur's estuary. In 1854–1858, Muravyov assisted Gennady Nevelskoy in achieving that goal. The first expedition took place in May 1854. A fleet of 77 barges and rafts, led by the steamship \"Argun\", sailed down to the Amur's estuary. Due to the Crimean War, a portion of the fleet was then sent to Kamchatka's Avacha Bay, where a series of artillery batteries was established to defend the peninsula. The batteries played a major role in defending the city of Petropavlovsk (see Siege of Petropavlovsk), which was attacked by the English and French forces.\n\nThe 1855's expedition transported the first Russian settlers to the Amur's estuary. Muravyov started negotiations with the Chinese about that time.\n\nDuring the last expedition of 1858, Muravyov concluded the Treaty of Aigun with the Qing official\nYishan. The Chinese were initially against setting any kinds of boundaries along the Amur River, preferring the \"status quo\" of keeping the adjacent territories under joint control of Russia and China. Muravyov, however, was able to persuade the Chinese that Russia's intentions were peaceful and constructive. The Treaty of Aigun effectively recognized the Amur River as the boundary between Russia and Qing Empire and granted Russia free access to the Pacific Ocean. For this, Muravyov was granted the title of Count Amursky (i.e., \"of the Amur River\"). According to an article by the Russian novelist Vladimir Barayev, the signing of the treaty was celebrated by grandiose illumination in Peking and festivities in major Siberian cities. The new territories acquired by Russia included Priamurye and most of the territories of modern Primorsky and Khabarovsk krais (territories).\n\nThe Treaty of Aigun was confirmed and expanded by the provisions of the Beijing Treaty of 1860, which granted Russia right to the Ussuri krai and southern parts of Primorye.\n\nAs a governor general of Eastern Siberia, Muravyov-Amursky made numerous attempts to settle the shores of the Amur River. These attempts were mostly unsuccessful as very few people wanted to move to the Amur voluntarily. Muravyov had to transfer several Baikal Cossacks detachments to populate the area. Also unsuccessful were attempts to organize steamboat transportation on the Amur and to build a postal road.\n\nAs the main objection of the St. Petersburg officials against taking over the left bank of the Amur was lack of people to defend the new territories, Muravyov-Amursky successfully petitioned to free Nerchinsk peasants from mandatory works in the ore mines. With these people, a 12,000 corps of Amur Cossacks was formed and used to settle some of the lands, the military core being the Cossacks transferred from the Transbaikalia.\n\nMuravyov-Amursky retired from his post of governor general in 1861 after his proposal to divide Eastern Siberia into two separate governorates general was declined. He was appointed as a member of the State Council. In 1868, he moved to Paris, France, where he lived until his death in 1881, visiting Russia only occasionally to participate in the State Council meetings.\n\nIn 1891, a bronze statue of Muravyov was erected on one of the Amur River's cliffs near Khabarovsk. In 1929, it was taken off and replaced with a statue of Lenin, which stood there until 1989. The Muravyov-Amursky memorial was restored in 1993.\n\nIn 1992, the remains of Muravyov-Amursky were brought from Paris to be re-buried in the central part of Vladivostok, which stands on the Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula, named after this statesman. In 2012 a bronze statue of the governor was installed over the tomb, overlooking the Zolotoy Rog bay, which he visited in 1850s.\n\nThe Khabarovsk monument—along with the Khabarovsk Bridge over the Amur River—is depicted on the 5000 ruble banknote issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on July 31, 2006.\n\n"}

However, the unadorned, plain and often field-modified Hardee hat was worn by Union troops, especially in the Western theater. The hardee hat was most famously worn and easily identified, as the hat worn by the Union Army's Iron Brigade, which became their trademark and were popularly known, by the nickname, \"The Black Hats\". \n\nThe hat apparently was named after William J.

During her time in the far east she participated as part of a Royal Navy flotilla in the 1927 Nanking Incident, helping to protect British and other international citizens and business interests. After a refit at Chatham, the ship recommissioned for the East Indies again on 31 August 1934, which tour lasted until September 1937, on relief by . On her return home she paid off to reserve.\n\nRecommissioned for war service, she joined the 12th Cruiser Squadron on Northern Patrol duties in September 1939.

During the early part of the war, until May 1940, her captain was the noted officer Augustus Agar, V.C.. On 24 June 1940 \"Emerald\" departed Greenock carrying £58 million in gold, and reached Halifax on 1 July where the gold was transferred to a Canadian National Railway train for safe storage in Canada until the threat of German invasion of England had passed.

The name Comrie is derived from the original Gaelic name con-ruith or comh-ruith (from \"con/comh\" 'together', and \"ruith\" \"to run\", \"running\") translating literally as \"running together\", but more accurately as \"flowing together\" or \"the place where rivers meet\". In modern Gaelic the name is more often transcribed as Comraidh, Cuimridh or Cuimrigh. This is an apt toponym as the village sits at the confluence of three rivers. The River Ruchill (Gaelic: \"An Ruadh Thuill\", The Red Flood) and The River Lednock (Gaelic: \"An Leathad Cnoc\", The Wooded Knoll) are all tributaries of the Earn (Gaelic: \"Uisge Dubh-Èireann\") at Comrie, which itself eventually feeds into the Tay (Gaelic: \"Uisge Tatha\").\n\nDue to its position astride the Highland Boundary Fault, Comrie experiences frequent earth tremors and has an old nickname of \"Shaky Toun/Toon\" (Scots) or 'Am Baile Critheanach' (Gaelic). In the 1830s around 7,300 tremors were recorded and today Comrie records earth tremors more often and to a higher intensity than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. Comrie became the site of one of the world's first seismometers in 1840, and a functional replica is still housed in the Earthquake House in The Ross in Comrie. The position of Comrie on the Highland Boundary Fault also gives the village a claim to the contested title of \"Gateway to the Highlands\". To the north of the village, Ben Chonzie and the Grampian Mountains rise majestically, while to the south of the village broad open moorland is joined by lesser mountains and glens that provide a wide range of terrain and ecology.\n\nThere is significant evidence of prehistoric habitation of the area, marked by numerous standing stones and archaeological remains that give insight into the original prehistoric, Pictish and later Celtic societies that lived here.\n\nIn AD 79, the Roman General Agricola chose what are now the outskirts of Comrie as the site for a fort and temporary marching camp, due to the area's strategic position on the southern fringe of the Highlands. It is one of the line of so-called \"Glen blocking\" forts running from Drumquhassle to Stracathro and including the legionary fortress of Inchtuthil. The temporary camp was c. 22 acre (c. 9 ha) in size. An infamous battle between the Celts and Romans is known to have occurred on the unidentified mountain Mons Graupius. The area around Comrie, Strathearn, is one of several proposed battle sites.\n\nJames V of Scotland came to Comrie and Cultybraggan regularly in September to hunt deer. Records survive of the food he consumed included bread, ale and fish sent from Sterling.\n\nComrie's early prosperity derived from weaving. This was mostly done as domestic piecework. Comrie was also important as a droving town. Cattle destined for the markets of the Scottish Lowlands and ultimately England would be driven south from their grazing areas in the Highlands. River crossings, such as at Comrie, were important staging posts on the way south. Much of the land around Comrie was owned by the Drummond family, Earls of Perth, latterly Earls of Ancaster, whose main seat was Drummond Castle, south of Crieff. Another branch of the Drummonds owned Drummondernoch (Gaelic: Drumainn Èireannach – Drummond of Ireland), to the west of the town. Aberuchill Castle, however, just outside Comrie was originally a Campbell seat.\n\nOver the years the village has grown to incorporate many smaller satellite settlements, including \"The Ross\" (Gaelic: \"An Ros\") a small settlement to the west of the village contained within a river peninsula (\"An Ros\" literally translates as peninsula) which became more accessible when the Ross Bridge was constructed in 1792. Before that the peninsula was only reached by a river ford. Similarly, the once isolated communities in the surrounding glens and mountains, such as Invergeldie in Glen Lednock and Dalchruin in Glen Artney, have generally come to be seen as part of Comrie village. Previously, they existed as small isolated settlements – for instance, Glen Lednock contained 21 different settlements of 350 individual structures and 25 corn-drying kilns. However, these exclusively Gaelic-speaking hamlets were largely eviscerated by the Highland Clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nComrie underwent something of a renaissance in the early 19th century and Victorian periods as an attractive location for wealthy residents and visitors, an image which has been maintained to this day. This popularity helped to bring the railway in 1893, when the Caledonian Railway completed a branch line from Crieff. The line was later extended to meet the Callander and Oban Railway at Lochearnhead. The Comrie–Lochearnheadline was closed in 1951 and the Comrie–Crieff line in 1964, due largely to the improved road network in the area.\n\nComrie's mountainous setting with abundant streams and lochs brought a number of hydro-electric power plants into the area in the earlier 20th century. A dam was built in Glen Lednock and water piped to another plant from Loch Earn in the west.\n\nToday Comrie is an attractive retirement village, recording the largest proportion of over-65s in Scotland in the 1991 census. Its economy is supplemented by adventure and wildlife tourism. As with other Highland villages, recent decades have seen an influx of relocated residents, predominantly from England and the Scottish central belt. This has encouraged a number of buy-to-let and second-home purchases and developments, which some see as an erosion of local culture and traditions and exhaustion of the housing stock for young locals. The result has been some degree of animosity for \"incomers\".\n\nThe White Church, the former parish kirk, is Comrie's most striking building, with a prominent tower and spire by the roadside of the ancient churchyard at the heart of the village. This is an early Christian site, dedicated to an obscure early saint, Kessog or Mokessog, who may have flourished in the 8th century. Comrie Parish Church is of a grand Gothic style, disproportionate to anything else in the village dominates the distant skyline. It was designed and built in 1881 by George T Ewing. Comrie is also graced by a little-known Charles Rennie Mackintosh building, a shop in the main street with a first floor corner turret built in a version of the Scottish vernacular style (not visible in the above illustration). Some of the buildings and homes in the village date back centuries, with many traditional Highland cottages built in dry-stone and/or clay and originally roofed in thatch. In the higher mountain glens around the village, traditional Highland blackhouses, most now in ruins, can also be found. There are a number of grand estate homes and historic castles in the area. For the most part, however, the main quadrants of the village house Victorian and Edwardian buildings, including many large detached villas and small terraces. The newer parts of the village are dominated by modern properties from the 1950s onward, including extremely modern properties of varying character.\n\nThe village won the Royal Horticultural Society \"Large Village Britain in Bloom award\" in 2007 and 2010. Comrie also won awards in the 2009 Beautiful Scotland Campaign, including Best Village and a special award for Continuous Community Involvement. In 2013 Comrie won gold in the village category of the Beautiful Scotland Awards and a special Community Horticulture Award.\n\nA granite obelisk atop Dùn Mòr (English: Great Hill) to the north commemorates Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville. It was designed by James Gillespie Graham in 1812. This monument is reached via a woodland trail through wooded Glen Lednock (Gaelic: \"Gleann Leathad Cnoc\") in which is found the \"Slocha'n Donish\" or \"De'ils Cauldron\" (also known as the \"Falls of Lednock\"). The trail begins in the village, at Laggan Park (Gaelic: An Làgan Mòr – The Great Basin) and ascends through a native forest of pines, oak, elm, ash rowan, alder and beech to Glen Lednock. Via \"The Shaky Bridge\" (although the original shaky bridge was replaced with a decidedly less shaky successor), hikers are treated to a splendid view of the glen, a truly Highland landscape, where a single-lane road leads up to Glen Lednock Reservoir and the Munro, Ben Chonzie. From there Dùn Mòr and the Monument are easily reached, offering unparalleled views across Strathearn and further west to the central Highlands. A swift descent (or ascent depending on the route chosen) leads through a long, steep, wooded gorge containing the impressive De'il's Cauldron. Here the river has cut a high, cascading waterfall in the surrounding rock, with pools below resembling a boiling cauldron. It is said that a water-elf, \"Uris-chidh\", lives here and tries to lure victims into the treacherous waters. The path down leads to a lesser companion to the great falls, \"The Wee Cauldron,\" with a calmer view of the river. The path through the forest eventually returns to the village.\n\nTo the south of the village is a military camp at nearby Cultybraggan. During World War II, this was POW Camp 21 for Italian and later German prisoners of war. This was a \"black\" camp as most of its inmates were ardent Nazis. It became infamous after anti-Nazi German POW Wolfgang Rosterg was lynched there by fellow inmates, who were hanged after the war for the act. Many more difficult Nazis were moved to POW Camp 165 at Watten in Caithness.\n\nThe camp grounds have a two-storey nuclear bunker (Cultybraggan RGHQ), the proposed site for a provincial Scottish government in case of nuclear attack. Even in the 1990s the bunker had accommodation, a telephone exchange, a sewage plant and a BBC studio. In 2007 a local community trust bought the camp and the surrounding of land, under Land Reform legislation, for the sum of £350,000.\n\nIn December 2016 Heinrich Steinmeyer, a former Waffen-SS prisoner of the camp until 1948, left Comrie £384,000 in his will, as an expression of \"my gratitude to the people of Scotland for the kindness and generosity that I have experienced in Scotland during my imprisonment of war and hereafter.\" A local trust manages the legacy.\n\n\nComrie has a number of amenities, which include a primary school, a post office, two hotels (\"The Comrie Hotel\" and \"The Royal Hotel\", both of which contain their own restaurant and bar), five churches of various denominations, two small cafés (one also the local fish and chip shop), a restaurant ('The De'il's Cauldron'), and an independent petrol station.\n\nThe railway to Perth was closed in 1964 by British Railways under the Beeching cuts.\n\nComrie has a curious Hogmanay ritual: on the stroke of midnight, a torchlight procession marches through the village. Traditionally the procession involves the twelve strongest men of the village carrying long, thick birch poles, to which burning tarred rags are attached and taken to each of the four corners of the village. The procession is usually accompanied by the village pipe band and villagers with floats and dressed in costume. After the procession the torches are thrown from the Dalginross Bridge into the River Earn. The origins of the ceremony are unclear. It is generally assumed to have pre-Christian Celtic or possibly Pictish roots and to be intended to cleanse the village of evil spirits in advance of the new year (albeit the new year's commencing in January is a relatively modern convention). The use of the birch tree specifically may have significance as the first letter of the Celtic Ogham alphabet, and a symbol of new beginning.\n\nThe spectacle attracts thousands of visitors to the small highland village each Hogmanay. A countdown to midnight is usually held at Melville Square and after the processions people gather here again for traditional Scottish music and dancing. Drinking alcohol in the street is commonplace and tolerated. Parties in village homes are common and other Scottish Hogmanay traditions like first footing are also observed.\n\nAn annual two-week festival, called the \"Comrie Fortnight\", is held in the village during July and August. The Comrie Fortnight started in the late 1960s and has evolved over the years, now consisting of a wide range of activities including competitions, outings, dances and a float parade. Profits from the Comrie Fortnight are used to support events and groups in the local community.\n\nToday the principal languages of Comrie are English, Gaelic and Scots.\n\nHistorically, Comrie and the surrounding area were part of the Gàidhealtachd. A 1799 statistical account of Comrie Parish states, \"The common language of the people is Gaelic and all the natives understand it; but many, especially the old, do not understand English.\" Gaelic appears to have remained the primary language in the early part of the 19th century, as testified by this 1828 passage by Mr Mushet, local minister at the time, describing the annual celebration of the sacrament of the lord's supper: \"The Lord favoured us (blessed be His name) with fair and seasonable weather. We had near eleven tables in Irish (Gaelic). Each table contained forty-eight persons or thereabout, and we had only two tables and some few persons at the third in English\". As with the rest of Scotland however, the process of language shift away from Gaelic and towards English, facilitated by the Highland Clearances and the Education (Scotland) Act of 1872, was apparently well established by the late 19th century. Indeed, by 1891 census estimates suggested that only 17.9 per cent of Comrie's population were native Gaelic speakers. In 1901 only 8.3 per cent of the population were native Gaelic speakers, while only 4.5 per cent had Gaelic as their sole language. The most recent census data for 2002 shows that less than 5 per cent are Gaelic speakers.\n\nThe decline of Gaelic in the area can be attributed largely to The Highland Clearances (Scottish Gaelic: \"Fuadach nan Gàidheal\") in the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw people in the smaller satellite settlements of the village (located in the surrounding mountains and glens) forcibly displaced from their homes, and many forced to emigrate to Canada, Australasia and North America. In addition, the Education (Scotland) Act of 1872 led to generations of Gaels forbidden from speaking their native language in the classroom, and punished for doing so. As with the rest of Scotland (excluding the north-west), Gaelic speakers have struggled to retain their language through the generations, though Comrie retains a larger than average number of speakers.\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\nComrie Golf Club was founded in 1891 and is situated on the outskirts of the village of Comrie.\n\n"}

The sketches were a recurring feature on the program between 1996 and 1998, and were written by cast member Will Ferrell and then-head writer Adam McKay. The sketch made a reappearance on the show on December 7, 2013, during which Ferrell made a guest appearance, as the episode was guest-hosted by his \"Anchorman 2\" co-star Paul Rudd.\n\nThe format of the sketches resembles the improv game \"Two Describe a Third.\" Three or four friends (known as the \"Bill Brasky Buddies\") gather in a public place to drink Scotch, smoke cigars, and loudly reminisce about their mutual acquaintance Bill Brasky. The Brasky Buddies are all apparently businessmen who worked with Brasky. They all have red cheeks, red noses, and big white teeth. They appear to be coming from a business conference, and are already very drunk.\n\nThe discussions begin with an agreement that \"Bill Brasky is a son of a bitch,\" at which point the Buddies proceed to tell tall tales of Brasky's superhuman feats, usually focused on his huge size, virility, celebrity connections, amazing tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and reckless disregard for human life. If their stories are to be believed, Brasky is enormously tall and heavy, superhumanly tough, can eat anything, has numerous affairs, and has killed and maimed many people. All of the salesmen have been his victim at one time or another, but they are all celebrated with the same gusto. At regular intervals, they raise their glasses to toast him, shouting \"To Bill Brasky!\"\n\nTypically, the three cycle through the same genres of comment four or five times. The first buddy will begin a long anecdote about Brasky, interrupted by the second drunkenly blurting out something embarrassing (e.g. \"I'm wearing a diaper\"). The buddies then exchange several shorter claims about Brasky. The cycle will then repeat, starting with the second Brasky Buddy, getting more outrageous each time around. At some point another man, usually Tim Meadows, will interject with \"Are you guys talking about Bill Brasky? I \"know\" Bill Brasky!\" and be welcomed into the group.\n\nSome sketches end with Brasky's appearance via a forced perspective shot that makes him look like a giant.\n\n\nIn addition to the Bill Brasky sketches, a sketch that followed a very similar format called \"Mr. Willoughby\" appeared on the January 14, 2006 episode of \"SNL\". Framed as a trailer for a movie based on a lost Jane Austen novel of the same title, the sketch featured Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey and host Scarlett Johansson as a trio of Victorian sisters rhapsodizing about one Mr. Willoughby, \"the most eligible bachelor in all of Upper Cornholeshire.\" Like the Brasky Buddies' stories, the sisters' descriptions of Willoughby steadily grow more and more bizarre, and they recount even the most repugnant facts (\"His teeth are like sharp pieces of corn!\") with an attitude of lovestruck awe. At several points the three sisters sigh, \"Mr. Willoughby!\" in unison, much like the Brasky Buddies' periodic toasts of \"To Bill Brasky!\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2079903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079903", "title": "Western pleasure", "text": "Western pleasure\n\nWestern Pleasure is a western style competition at horse shows that evaluates horses on manners and suitability of the horse for a relaxed but collected gait cadence and relatively slow speed of gait, along with calm and responsive disposition. The horse is to appear to be a \"pleasure\" to ride and very comfortable, while being very smooth. Most light horse breeds in the United States and Canada may compete in western pleasure classes, either in open competition or at shows limited to a single breed. However, horse conformation and temperament play a role in this event, and hence animals that are calm, quiet, have collected, soft gaits and the strong muscling required to sustain slow, controlled movement are the most competitive.\n\nNearly any breed can be exhibited in western pleasure classes. The highest levels of competition are usually in shows restricted to a single breed, but at lower levels, there are open classes where multiple breeds may compete against one another. Across all breeds, horses are generally to move in a slow, light, calm, relaxed manner, with minimal rein contact. The desired \"frame,\" or style, of the horse may vary from breed to breed.\n\nIn open or all-breed competition, stock horse breeds such as the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse and Appaloosa tend to be favored by the judges, though quality individuals from other breeds such as the Morgan horse and Arabian horse can be competitive if not penalized for their natural conformation that gives them a somewhat higher-set neck. \"Gaited\" breeds such as the Missouri Fox Trotter and the Tennessee Walker often have their own Western Pleasure classes with standards adapted to evaluate their use of intermediate gaits other than the jog trot. Even breeds that are traditionally shown mostly in English riding disciplines, such as the American Saddlebred or the Friesian, may offer western pleasure classes with judging specifications that are adapted to the conformation and way of going of those breeds.\n\nThe stock horse breeds are shown with a style referred to as a \"level top line.\" Their movement is described as \"daisy cutting,\" as they have very little knee action, but their hindquarters are actively engaged and their hocks reach well under the body. They carry their neck nearly level with their withers, and head just slightly in front of vertical, but are to be penalized if their poll is carried lower than their withers. The head and neck move very little at any gait. They are exhibited with little to no bit contact and a loop in the rein. The style used to show these horses is derived from the \"Texas\" cowboy tradition.\n\n\"Saddle type\" horses encompass a large group of horse breeds of many sizes and body types that have an arched and high-set neck and naturally greater knee action. They are shown in a style derived from the \"California\" vaquero cowboy tradition, particularly that of the finished spade bit horse. They are to show with a lightly arched neck, their heads relatively low and tucked to be almost exactly perpendicular to the ground, with horses overflexed or going \"behind the bit\" to be penalized. Though a self-carried horse is desired, with minimal bit contact and a draped rein visible, this effect is often achieved by use of weighted reins, as by nature they are ridden with somewhat more contact and have more forward motion than the stock type.\n\nThe Arabian and Morgan breeds produce horses specially bred for the western disciplines and offer western pleasure classes that draw large numbers of competitors. Breeds such as the American Saddlebred or Friesian have smaller numbers competing in western competition than other events, but classes are available. Most gaited horses fall into the saddle type category in terms of desired frame and style, though judging criteria for their gaits differs significantly from that of non-gaited breeds.\n\nHorses and riders show in western tack and attire. The horse carries a western saddle, and wears an open-faced bridle without a noseband. The rider wears a long-sleeved shirt, sometimes with a vest or jacket, chaps, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots. Gloves and spurs are optional. Shirts and vests or jackets are often brightly colored and sometimes elaborately decorated to mimic popular styles in western wear. Riders at smaller shows usually wear denim jeans under their chaps, while at regional and national competitions, western-styled polyester dress pants that match the rider's shirt or chaps are worn by women, while men tend to stick to jeans. Men usually wear a neckscarf, often of silk, and women may too wear a neckscarf, but in recent years as rules have been relaxed, brooches and necklaces are now also seen on female riders.\n\nWhile all western pleasure horses are to be clean (generally bathed prior to a show) and well groomed, with legs, bridle path, ears, muzzle, and other areas neatly clipped, grooming details vary by breed. Length of bridle path is usually determined by breed, with longer-necked breeds usually sporting a longer bridle path than the stock horse breeds.\n\nCasual observers will mostly notice breed differences in the style of the horse's mane. Though fads vary a bit from year to year, in the stock horse breeds, the mane is usually shortened and thinned, often \"banded,\" in that the mane is divided into many small segments and small rubber bands are placed around each segment in order to make the overall mane lay flat and neat. However, in some years, long manes have been \"in,\" and in other years a thinned mane with a braided forelock or a few small braids in the front of the mane has been popular. Arabians and Morgans are less prone to fads as they have long been required to show with \"natural\" long, unthinned, unbanded, unbraided manes. Gaited breeds and Saddlebreds usually sport the same mane style in both English pleasure and western pleasure classes, long and flowing but with a colorful ribbon braided into the forelock and into the front section of the mane.\n\nTails are usually kept relatively long and flowing for nearly all breeds. Artificial tails or tail extensions are often allowed, though are banned for Arabians and Morgans, where a full tail is a breed trait.\n\nThe riders compete as a group at the same time, traveling around the outer edge of the arena. All contestants, at the command of the event's judge, are asked to have their horse walk, jog (a slow trot), and lope both directions in an arena, as well as to stand quietly and back up readily. This may seem easy to some, but actually involves more types of riding skills than the casual observer may realize. The judge looks at every detail. In addition, many judges will ask for extended gaits, particularly an extended jog and, in some breeds, the hand gallop.\n\nWinning horses are decided on their quality of movement, proper behavior, form in motion, and calm manner. As stated in the show rules of the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), \"maximum credit should be given to the flowing, balanced and willing horse which gives the appearance of being fit and a pleasure to ride.\" The Western Division of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) has similar requirements. Faults are assessed on infractions such as excessive speed or slowness, breaking gait, or incorrect head position.\n\nAccording to the American Paint Horse Association rule book, in judging western pleasure, credit is to be given to the horse that under light control and without intimidation goes forward with comfort, self-carriage, confidence, willingness, and a balanced, fluid stride. To evaluate these things a judge should look for these six characteristics: cadence and rhythm, top line and expression, consistency and length of stride, in that order. Cadence is defined as: The accuracy of a horse's footfalls at any given gait. Rhythm is defined as: The speed of those footfalls at any given gait. The Topline: The head and neck should be carried in a relaxed natural position, compatible with the horse's conformation. The head should not be carried behind the vertical, giving the appearance of intimidation or be excessively nosed out, giving a resistant appearance. Expression should have a pleasant look with clear, bright eyes and a willing attitude. Consistency is defined as the ability to maintain the same top line, cadence and rhythm in each gait throughout the class. Length of stride should be of a reasonable length in relation to that horse's conformation with a full extension of the limbs. The winner of any western pleasure class should be the horse that best combines these six characteristics. Cadence and rhythm should always be first and most important in evaluating a western pleasure horse.\n\nThe Western Pleasure rider's seat is deep, with a long stirrup, to assist the horse in driving deeply from the rear and elevating the shoulders. Reins are kept loose and relaxed, though quiet and subtle rein signals are still used. While equitation of the rider is not judged in a pleasure class, a properly positioned rider will obtain a better performance from the horse.\n\nWestern pleasure competition, like any event, has controversies and situations where fads become so extreme as to possibly constitute abuse. Therefore, most organizations that sanction horse shows have strict rules to prevent the worst problems. Nonetheless, it is hard to regulate fads, and horse show sanctioning organizations usually tout education of judges as the best method available to prevent fads from escalating into more serious problems.\n\nBecause western pleasure emphasis calmness and manners, some individuals attempt to circumvent good training by using tranquilizers to steady their horses. However, drug rules of both the AQHA and USEF are strict, and both owners and trainers of horses that test positive for drugs are sanctioned heavily.\n\nAnother abusive practice that is penalized if discovered is the process of \"nerving\" the horse's tail. If a horse is bored and irritable, it will express its displeasure by swishing its tail vigorously. Horses who are shown too long and schooled too repetitively can become \"ring sour,\" exhibiting a bored, unhappy, and irritable manner. A ring sour horse will often flatten its ears and swish its tail every time it is given a command. Because tail swishing is penalized, some competitors resorted to cutting the nerves in a ring sour horse's tail to prevent the tail from moving. Because this also keeps the horse from brushing away flies, leaving it helpless against biting insects, the practice was quickly banned, and horses with nerved tails are no longer allowed in the show ring. However, some competitors still resort to temporarily numbing the tail with drugs, alcohol injections , or by mechanical means. This is also illegal if discovered but, as no scars remain, can be difficult to spot. The practice of nerving the tail was less of a problem in breeds where a high-carried tail is a breed trait, though temporarily numbing the tail is not completely unknown even in these breeds.\n\nThe sport of western pleasure has been criticized on account of an extremely low head position many judges were favoring in the stock horse breeds, known as the \"peanut roller.\" In this head set, horses carry their heads with the poll far below the level of their withers. This is a problem because it also forced the horse to travel at an extremely slow pace on the \"forehand\" (carrying too much weight on their front legs instead of rocking it correctly back onto their hind legs). Over long periods of time, moving in this highly artificial frame can cause soundness problems in some horses, and even a sound horse cannot properly bring its hindquarters under its body when traveling forward. This fad and its problems created a poor view of the discipline as a whole, especially by competitors in other equestrian sports.\n\nThe industry has since been praised on its actions to change the \"peanut roller\" fad, though excessively low head positions are still seen at times. In the USEF, this constituted implementing specific rules, including a strict requirement that a horse must have its poll no lower than the height of its withers, or, in the case of the AQHA, a rule stating that the ideal gait shall be performed with a \"level topline.\" Additional rules make an extreme headset impossible by asking exhibitors to extend their horse's jog during a class. In the case of the AQHA, which took particularly strong action to reverse the trend, videos were sent out to all licensed judges to demonstrate what was and was not correct, and the materials also made available to the general public.\n\nA new fad, seen in nearly all breeds, requires a horse to perform with an extremely loose, draped rein at all times. Western pleasure horses have always traveled on a fairly loose rein, but in recent years the visible \"drape\" in the rein has become exaggerated. However, it requires time, good riding ability, and careful training to correctly teach a horse \"self carriage,\" particularly to slow or stop by responding to only a rider's use of seat position (and sometimes voice) without tightening the reins. Thus, an alternative method of training to slow a horse down without the use of the reins gave rise to a new, highly controversial, technique known as the \"spur stop,\" an unconventional method used by some trainers to train horses to slow down and stop when spur pressure is applied.\n\nBecause spur, heel or leg pressure is generally used to ask a horse to go faster, this technique is sometimes referred to by its critics as \"riding the brake\" and is frowned upon by several major western pleasure sanctioning organizations since at least 2003, when AQHA put out a series of videos on correct and incorrect style and way of going for western pleasure horses, showing a \"hit list\" of undesirable traits not to be rewarded in the show ring, with the spur stop leading the list.\n\nThis controversy in Western Pleasure circles resembles the debate over Rollkur in the field of dressage, particularly over the question of whether the practice constitutes animal abuse.\n\nExperts differ on the validity of the spur stop. As stated by trainer Bob Avila: \"the spur stop is “the worst thing ever invented. If I were to get a horse in for training that had a spur stop on him, I could do one event on him, period: Western pleasure.” Taking the opposing view, Mark Sheridan, an AQHA judge and trainer, has said: \"You should not have any problems with the spur stop, and the transition to whatever events you decide to do with [the horse]. Personally, I put a spur stop on just the stop and back, on my western riders.\"\n\nA less extreme method is referred to as putting \"buttons\" on the horse. A \"button\" is simply a leg or spur position that is trained by operant conditioning that tells the horse to travel at a particular gait or speed. These are often highly customized to an individual horse and rider team. While less extreme than the spur stop, such techniques still take the horse away from traditional responses to the riding aids of seat, hands, weight and voice, which can also lead to an excessively artificial way of going by the animal.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his roles in a number of television series including \"General Hospital\" (as Paul Hornsby), \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (as Dr. Pierce Peterson) and \"One Life to Live\" (as Spencer Truman). He has also appeared in films such as \"Creepshow 2\", \"Arena\", and \"Bruce Almighty\".\n\nSatterfield began his credited career as a male model before moving to acting in films and television shows. In 1987, he had his first significant film appearance in the horror anthology film \"Creepshow 2\", playing the role of Deke in a segment based on a Stephen King's story \"The Raft\". This is followed by a starring role in \"Arena\" in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, he had a guest role in the popular teenage drama, \"Beverly Hills, 90210\". That year he also became the first actor to play the role of Paul Hornsby on the ABC soap opera, \"General Hospital\", a part he portrayed until 1994. He then starred alongside Jennifer Lopez in the short-lived television series \"Hotel Malibu\". In 1997, he had recurring roles in \"Savannah\", \"7th Heaven\", and \"Pacific Palisades\". After numerous appearances of the big and small screens, Satterfield returned to soap operas portraying Dr. Pierce Peterson on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" from 1998 to 1999 and 2001-2002. He had guest roles on many shows including \"7th Heaven\", \"Will & Grace\" and the American version of the British sitcom, \"Coupling\". He later had a minor role in Jim Carrey's 2003 film, \"Bruce Almighty\".\n\nSatterfield most recently portrayed Dr. Spencer Truman on the ABC soap opera, \"One Life to Live\", a role he originated in June 2005. His character was killed off on January 26, 2007, but Satterfield continued to make numerous appearances via flashbacks and dreams until August 2007. In 2011, he appeared in the second season of \"The Bay\".\n\nSatterfield has since pursued a career in education after finishing a Masters Degree in education at Drury University in 2013.\n\nSatterfield was born in Nashville, Tennessee. He is the son of Paul Satterfield, a Nashville firefighter who was killed in the line of duty, and singer songwriter Priscilla Coolidge. \nHe is also the nephew of the singer Rita Coolidge. His stepfather was Booker T. Jones of Booker T and the MGs fame.\n\nSatterfield was often mistaken for Christopher Reeve because of their striking resemblance. He reminisced about the confusion from the press and public in a 2005 issue of \"ABC Soaps In Depth\" magazine, \"As soon as I would show up, I would get mobbed by the press and everybody thinking I was him because he was supposed to be there.\" The case of mistaken identity would continue throughout the night, where Satterfield would frequently have to tell the confused onlookers, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I think the person you want to talk to is over there,\" only to overhear people later refer to him as \"Chris Reeve's little brother.\" Satterfield did meet Reeves a few times, and the two would joke about their eerie physical similarities. \"It was almost like when we would shake hands, it was like shaking my own hand. We had the same height - 6'4\", the same build - you know, it was just unbelievable.\"\n"}
{"id": "2079917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079917", "title": "Blue World Order", "text": "Blue World Order\n\nThe Blue World Order (bWo) was a stable of professional wrestlers formed at Extreme Championship Wrestling's November to Remember 1996 event at the ECW Arena. The stable lasted until August 1998 and was revived briefly in World Wrestling Entertainment during the summer of 2005. During the time period of 2010 and 2015 they have made several appearances in various local house shows.\n\nSince July 1996, Stevie Richards (Michael Manna) and The Blue Meanie (Brian Heffron) had been making parodies of various wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In early 1996 Raven was forming a stable called Raven's Nest and was gathering new members. He called upon Stevie and Meanie along with an independent performer from New Jersey, Nova (Mike Bucci). These three would often come to the ring together before Raven made his entrance, imitating rock bands or pop culture references, most notably The Jackson 5 and at \"ECW The Doctor is In\" in August 1996 as the rock band KISS. The latter received a great ovation from the ECW fans before The Sandman abruptly entered the ring and caned them. Backstage after the event, Buh Buh Ray Dudley told them how great it was and the only thing greater would be a parody of the nWo. After clearing things with Paul Heyman and Raven, it was decided that they would form the bWo at the next big event, \"November to Remember '96\". Over the next few months, members were added and members left just like the group they were imitating. Initially meant to be a one off parody, the Blue World Order became immensely popular and elevated Richards to the main event level in ECW.\nThe height of the bWo's success came at the first ECW pay per view, Barely Legal. The event saw the debut of bWo Japan (with members Taka Michinoku, Terry Boy, and Dick Togo), and Big Stevie Cool was part of the 3-Way Dance main event for the #1 contendership for the ECW World Title. Just weeks after this event Richards suffered a severe injury to his neck courtesy of Terry Funk and a metal guardrail which left him temporarily paralyzed for over an hour. In July 1997, Nova had a match against Taz in which Taz vowed to kill the bWo. He squashed Nova, and although Meanie and Nova continued to tag over the next few months, the bWo was indeed dead in November 1998.\n\nThe bWo reunited in 2005 at WWE's ECW reunion show, ECW One Night Stand, coming to the ring before the Dudley Boyz versus Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman match. During their entrance, Joey Styles (laughing hysterically once they entered) said that \"If any gimmick never deserved to make a dime and made a boatload of cash, this is it! And the best part is that they (WCW) couldn't sue us, 'cause it's a parody!\"\n\nOn July 7, 2005, the bWo reunited once again, this time to confront JBL. During the group brawl at the end of One Night Stand, JBL sought out The Blue Meanie and legitimately assaulted him after Meanie called him a \"backstage bully\". The attack by JBL caused Meanie to tear some recent stitches and bleed at One Night Stand. JBL then taunted the bWo and called Meanie a \"fat little bitch\". This led to a Meanie versus JBL no- disqualification match. Richards delivered a stiff chairshot to JBL during the match that busted him open. The Blue Meanie won the match after he hit his finisher, the Meaniesault, and Batista ran in and gave a spinebuster to JBL and threw an out-of-it Meanie on top of JBL.\n\nLater, the bWo challenged The Mexicools to a match at The Great American Bash, with Stevie Richards saying the bWo was tired of the Mexicools interfering in people's matches, saying they were going to take over and rise up against the gringos because \"We \"invented\" that!\" - which then prompted Hollywood Nova to say \"Actually, we never said we were going to rise up against the gringos\". The three members appeared on \"WWE Velocity\" in a six-man tag match against 3 jobbers to prepare themselves for their tag match against the Mexicools. At the Great American Bash, the bWo and Mexicools met in a six-man tag match. They even drove into the ring on tricycles to parody the Mexicools' usual ring entrance on John Deere lawnmowers. The bWo lost the match after Super Crazy hit a moonsault and Psicosis hit the guillotine legdrop on Big Stevie Cool for the win. As the month of July ended, the bWo faded from the scene. Stevie Richards went back to his old gimmick, as did Hollywood Nova, while Blue Meanie was never officially contracted by WWE.\n\nThere were some bWo reunions in later years in different independents. When Richards went to TNA, Bucci and Heffron took part in a couple of shows.\n\nOn April 18, 2009 Nova and Blue Meanie unsuccessfully challenged for the British promotion One Pro Wrestling tag-team titles, losing to Project Ego (Kris Travis and Martin Kirby). That was Bucci's first in-ring performance in nearly 3 years.\n\nOn June 27, 2009 they appeared with many other former ECW talent at the Francine Fournier-run benefit show entitled \"Legends of The Arena\". The event took place at the original ECW Arena in South Philadelphia as a benefit for deceased members of Francine's family; a portion of the ticket sales went to The American Cancer Society. bWo defeated the team of Little Guido and Big Sal, The Full Blooded Italians.\n\nOn December 12, 2009 Nova and Meanie took part in the International Wrestling Cartel show \"Full Circle\" in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. They united with Shane Douglas and defeated local stars Frank Stalletto, Lord Zoltan and Lou Marconi.\n\nOn August 8, 2010 the bWo reunited on the TNA PPV Hardcore Justice. Heffron couldn't attend the show due to personal responsibilities to take care of in Philadelphia prior to going on his vacation the next day; still, his promo was aired on PPV and in the arena he was replaced by Big Tilly. Steve Richards, accompanied by Nova and Tilly, defeated Peter Polaco and later in the night Tilly and Nova attacked Tommy Dreamer during his match with Raven.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Chikara promotion announced that Big Stevie Cool, Da Blue Guy and Hollywood Nova would be reuniting as the Blue World Order for the 2015 King of Trios tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament in their first round match on September 4 by the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster).\n\nOn March 30, 2017, the bWo made a one-night reunion at WrestleCon in a six-man tag team match, defeating the team of Kevin Matthews, Mario Bokara and Pat Buck.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079925", "title": "Vampire films", "text": "Vampire films\n\nVampire films have been a staple since the era of silent films, so much so that the depiction of vampires in popular culture is strongly based upon their depiction in films throughout the years. The most popular cinematic adaptation of vampire fiction has been from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel \"Dracula\", with over 170 versions to date. Running a distant second are adaptations of the 1872 novel \"Carmilla\" by Sheridan Le Fanu. By 2005, Dracula had been the subject of more films than any other fictional character, save for Sherlock Holmes.\n\nAs folklore, vampires are defined by their need to feed on blood and on their manipulative nature; this theme has been held in common throughout the many adaptations. Although vampires are usually associated with the horror (and sometimes zombie genre), vampire films may also fall into the drama, action, science fiction, romance, comedy or fantasy genres, amongst others.\n\nEarly cinematic vampires in other such films as \"The Vampire\" (1913), directed by Robert G. Vignola, were not undead bloodsucking fiends, but 'vamps'. Such femme fatales were inspired by a poem by Rudyard Kipling called \"The Vampire\", composed in 1897. This poem was written as kind of commentary on a painting of a female vampire by Philip Burne-Jones exhibited in the same year. Lyrics from Kipling's poem: \"A fool there was ... \", describing a seduced man, were used as the title of the film \"A Fool There Was\" (1915) starring Theda Bara as the 'vamp' in question and the poem was used in the publicity for the film.\n\nThe first adaptation of the immortal aristocrat was without a doubt the Hungarian feature film Drakula halála (Károly Lajthay, 1921), even though today he is truly and sadly lost.\n\nAn authentic supernatural vampire features in the landmark \"Nosferatu\" (1922 Germany, directed by F. W. Murnau) starring Max Schreck as the hideous Count Orlok. This was an unlicensed version of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", based so closely on the novel that the estate sued and won, with all copies ordered to be destroyed. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. The destruction of the vampire, in the closing sequence of the film, by sunlight rather than the traditional stake through the heart proved very influential on later films and became an accepted part of vampire lore.\n\nThe next classic treatment of the vampire legend was an adaptation of the stage play based on Bram Stoker's novel \"Dracula\", Universal's \"Dracula\" (1931) starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance was so popular that his Hungarian accent and sweeping gestures became characteristics now commonly associated with Dracula. Five years after the release of the film, Universal released \"Dracula's Daughter\" (1936), a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, \"Son of Dracula\" starring Lon Chaney Jr., followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944) and \"House of Dracula\" (1945)—both starring John Carradine—and \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948). While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other films during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula on-screen for the second (and last) time.\n\nDracula was reincarnated for a new generation in the Hammer Films series starring Christopher Lee as the Count. In the first of these films \"Dracula\" (1958) the spectacular death of the title character through being exposed to the sun reinforced this part of vampire lore, first established in \"Nosferatu\", and made it virtually axiomatic in succeeding films. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of the seven sequels. A more faithful adaptation of Stoker's novel appeared as \"Dracula\" (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, though also identifying Count Dracula with the notorious medieval Balkan ruler Vlad III the Impaler.\n\nA distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's \"Carmilla\", explored the topic of the lesbian vampire. Although implied in \"Dracula's Daughter\", the first openly lesbian vampire was in \"Blood and Roses\" (1960) by Roger Vadim. More explicit lesbian content was provided in Hammer's Karnstein Trilogy. The first of these, \"The Vampire Lovers\" (1970), starring Ingrid Pitt and Madeline Smith, was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality. Later films in this subgenre such as \"Vampyres\" (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence.\n\nBeginning with \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948) the vampire has often been the subject of comedy. \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" (1967) by Roman Polanski was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include \"Vampira\" (1974) featuring David Niven as a lovelorn Dracula, \"Love at First Bite\" (1979) featuring George Hamilton, \"My Best Friend Is a Vampire\" (1988), \"Innocent Blood\" (1992), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"\" (1995), directed by Mel Brooks with Leslie Nielsen, and, more recently, Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's mockumentary take on the subject, \"What We Do in the Shadows\" (2014).\n\nAnother development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. \"The Last Man on Earth\" (1964, directed by Sidney Salkow), \"The Omega Man\" (1971 US, directed by Boris Sagal) and two other films were all based on Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend\". They explain the condition as having a natural cause. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in David Cronenberg's \"Rabid\" (1976) and \"Red-Blooded American Girl\" (1990) directed by David Blyth, as well as in the \"Blade\" trilogy to a limited extent.\n\nRace has been another theme, as exemplified by the blaxploitation picture \"Blacula\" (1972) and its sequel \"Scream Blacula Scream\".\n\nThough always a representation of passion and desire, since the time of Béla Lugosi's \"Dracula\" (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. Christopher Lee, Delphine Seyrig, Frank Langella and Lauren Hutton are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex appeal into their portrayal of the vampire. Latterly, the implicit sexual themes of vampire film have become much more overt, culminating in such films as \"Gayracula\" (1983) and \"The Vampire of Budapest\" (1995), two pornographic all-male vampire films, and \"Lust for Dracula\" (2005), a softcore pornography all-lesbian adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel.\n\nThere is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal \"Nosferatu\" (1922) in which the portrayal of the vampire is similar to the hideous creature of European folklore. Max Schreck's portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's remake \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979). In \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000) (directed by E. Elias Merhige) Willem Dafoe plays Max Schreck, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Stephen King's \"Salem's Lot\" (1979) notably depicts vampires as terrifying, simple-minded creatures, without eroticism, and with the only desire to feed on the blood of others. The main vampire in the \"Subspecies\" films, Radu, also exhibits similar aesthetic influences, such as long fingers and nails and generally grotesque facial features. This type of vampire is also featured in the film \"30 Days of Night\".\n\nA major character in most vampire films is the vampire hunter, of which Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in \"Vampires\" (1998), directed by John Carpenter, Jack Crow (James Woods) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters and in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui), writer Joss Whedon (who created TV's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and spin-off \"Angel\") attached the Slayer, Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson in the film, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV series), to a network of Watchers and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers.\n\nBy far, the most well-known and popular vampire in the films is Count Dracula. A large number of films have been filmed over the years depicting the evil Count, some of which are ranked among the greatest depictions of vampires on film. Dracula has over 170 film representations to date, making him the most frequently portrayed character in horror films; also he has the highest number of film appearances overall, surpassed only by Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOne of the first television series with a vampire as a main character was the 1964 comedy series \"The Munsters\". Lily Munster and Grandpa (also known as Vladimir Dracula, Count of Transylvania) are vampires.\n\n\"The Munsters\" was followed in 1966 by the Gothic soap opera \"Dark Shadows\", in which the vampire Barnabas Collins became a main character. \n\nIn 1985 \"The Little Vampire\" was a television series made for children. It tells the adventures of the vampire child Rüdiger and his human friend Anton.\n\n\"Forever Knight\" (1992–1996) was the first vampire detective story, later followed by many similar series like \"Angel\", \"Moonlight\", \"Blood Ties\" and \"Vampire Prosecutor\".\n\nIn 1997 the teenage vampire series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" became popular around the world. Buffy is a teenage girl who finds out that she is a vampire slayer. She also finds herself drawn to a vampire.\n\n\"True Blood\" (2008) centers on the adventures of the telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who falls in love with a vampire. In the same year BBC Three series \"Being Human\" became popular in Britain. It features an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol.\n\nIn 2009 \"The Vampire Diaries\" told the story of the school girl Elena Gilbert, who falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore, but finds herself also drawn to Stefan's brother Damon Salvatore.\n\n\"The Strain\" (2014) is based on the novel of the same name by Guillermo del Toro.\n\nOne of the first animated vampire series was the 1988 series \"Count Duckula\", a parody of Dracula. In 1985, the anime film adaptation of the inaugural \"Vampire Hunter D\" novel was released direct-to-video and became popular in both Japan and the United States, prompting an adaptation of the third novel into the also direct to video film \"\" in 2000. The two films and the novels they are based on revolve around the eponymous D, a vampire hunter who is the apparent half-vampire/half-human son of Dracula who battles vampires in the year AD 12,090. In 1997 the anime series \"Vampire Princess Miyu\" became popular in Japan, many other anime followed. Later in 2012, \"Hotel Transylvania\" was released, followed by a sequel in 2015, \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" and in 2018 by \"\".\n\nAnother Japanese anime series, \"Rosario + Vampire\", portrays one of the leading female characters, Moka Akashiya, as a vampire, whose demonic powers are sealed inside her with a rosary seal around her neck. The series portrays other kinds of fictional monsters as well, including a witch and a snowwoman.\n\nFrom 2001 onward vampire web series became popular around the world. One of the first web series was the 2001 series \"The Hunted\". It is about a group of vampire slayers who have been bitten by vampires (but not yet turned into vampires) and try to fight the bloodsucking vampires. \"The Hunted\" was followed by \"\" (2007) and \"\" (2008) who were based on the films \"30 Days of Night\" and \"\". In 2009 the MTV online series \"Valemont\" follows Maggie Gracen, who decides to infiltrate Valemont University, because her brother Eric has vanished. She soon finds out that the University is full of vampires. The 2009 web series \"I Heart Vampires\" focuses on two teenage vampire fans, who find out that vampires are more than real. In 2011 the \"Being Human\" spin-off \"Becoming Human\" was released online. It is about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who go to a school together and try to solve a murder. The 2014 vampire series \"Carmilla\" features a retelling of the story of the vampire Carmilla Karnstein, who attends a university in the modern day and falls in love with a human girl.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "2079927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079927", "title": "Irrigation sprinkler", "text": "Irrigation sprinkler\n\nAn irrigation sprinkler (also known as a water sprinkler or simply a sprinkler) is a device used to irrigate agricultural crops, lawns, landscapes, golf courses, and other areas. They are also used for cooling and for the control of airborne dust. Sprinkler irrigation is the method of applying water in a controlled manner in way similar to rainfall. The water is distributed through a network that may consist of pumps, valves, pipes, and sprinklers. \n\nIrrigation sprinklers can be used for residential, industrial, and agricultural usage. It is useful on uneven land where sufficient water is not available as well as on sandy soil. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals.\nWhen water is pressurized through the main pipe it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop. In sprinkler or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high pressure sprinklers or guns.\n\nHigher pressure sprinklers that themselves move in a circle are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism (impact sprinklers). These can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle.\n\nRainguns are similar to impact sprinklers, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbf/in² (275 to 900 kPa) and flows of 50 to 1200 US gal/min (3 to 76 L/s), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 0.5 to 1.9 inches (10 to 50 mm). In addition to irrigation, guns are used for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging.\n\nMany irrigation sprinklers are buried in the ground along with their supporting plumbing, although above ground and moving sprinklers are also common. Most irrigation sprinklers operate through electric and hydraulic technology and are grouped together in zones that can be collectively turned on and off by actuating a solenoid-controlled valve.\n\nHome lawn sprinklers vary widely in their size, cost, and complexity. They include impact sprinklers, oscillating sprinklers, drip sprinklers, underground sprinkler systems, and portable sprinklers. Permanently installed systems may often operate on timers or other automated processes. They are occasionally installed with retractable heads for aesthetic and practical reasons, reducing damage during lawn mowing. These types of systems usually can be programmed to start automatically on a set time and day each week.\n\nSmall portable sprinklers can be placed temporarily on lawns if additional watering is needed or if no permanent system is in place. These are often attached to an outdoor water faucet and are placed for a short period of time. Other systems may be professionally installed permanently in the ground and are attached permanently to a home's plumbing system. \n\nAn antique sprinkler developed by Nomad called a 'set-and-forget tractor sprinkler' was used in Australia in the 1950s. Water pressure ensured that the sprinkler moved slowly across a lawn.\n\nThe first use of sprinklers by farmers was some form of home and golf course type sprinklers. These ad hoc systems, while doing the job of the buried pipes and fixed sprinkler heads, interfered with cultivation and were expensive to maintain. \nCenter-pivot irrigation was invented in 1940 by farmer Frank Zybach, who lived in Strasburg, Colorado.\nIn the 1950s, a firm based in Portland, Oregon \"Stout-Wyss Irrigation System\", developed a rolling pipe type irrigation system for farms that has become the most popular type for farmers irrigating large fields. With this system, large wheels attached to the large pipes with sprinkler heads move slowly across the field.\n\nUnderground sprinklers function through means of basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve and all of the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located in the center of the valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these pipes and flush to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers. These sprinklers can be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 1.5–2m (7–15 ft.), full rotating sprinklers that can spray a broken stream of water from 6–12m (20–40 ft.), or small drip emitters that release a slow, steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs. use of indigenous materials also recommended.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that use of common garden hoses in combination with spray nozzles may generate aerosols containing droplets smaller than 10 μm, which can be inhaled by nearby people. Water stagnating in a hose between uses, especially when warmed by the sun, can host the growth and interaction of Legionella and free-living amoebae (FLA) as biofilms on the inner surface of the hose. Clinical cases of Legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever have been found to be associated with inhalation of garden hose aerosols containing Legionella bacteria. The report provides measured microbial densities resulting from controlled hose conditions in order to quantify the human health risks. The densities of Legionella spp. identified in two types of hoses were found to be similar to those reported during legionellosis outbreaks from other causes. It is proposed that the risk could be mitigated by draining hoses after use.\n\n"}

Initially, his favoured position of left winger was occupied by Argentine Kily González but, despite serious contention for a first-team place, he still managed to net five goals in 33 La Liga games, adding 13 appearances in the season's UEFA Champions League although he was left on the bench for the final against FC Bayern Munich.\n\nThe arrival of Rafael Benítez as coach in 2001–02 would mark Vicente's opportunity to prove himself, and he did not disappoint as his progress led to the club's first league title in over 30 years. While appearing in fewer games (31, with one goal) he was already first-choice, and produced similar numbers in the following campaign, netting his only goal in a 3–0 home win over Recreativo de Huelva.\n\n2003–04 was Vicente's finest season with the club as his energetic efforts propelled the \"Che\" to their second league title under Benítez, adding two goals in seven matches in the team's victorious run in the UEFA Cup, including one in the final where he also assisted Mista in the second (the pair combined for 30 league goals, 12 from Vicente, a career-best, with Francisco Rufete pitching in from the right flank).\n\nAfter a productive year, Vicente was linked with a host of important clubs, but turned down any eventual move and signed a further four-year extension, stating: \"I'm happy to remain at Valencia because I was born here and it's my home.\" In the 2004–05 season, however, under the management of Claudio Ranieri, his forays down the wing appeared stagnated as the coach opted to favour fellow Italian Emiliano Moretti to provide support for him rather than to let him have a free role along the left – furthermore, ankle injuries hindered his campaign and he spent much of the beginning on the sidelines. As he returned, the manager had already been sacked, Valencia ranked seventh and he only appeared in 12 league matches; in the following year more of the same, as the side finished 11 points behind eventual champions FC Barcelona and he was again bothered by an ankle condition.\n\nVicente was again often injured in 2006–07, most notably in the first leg of a Champions League quarter-final clash with Chelsea which ended his campaign. The English won that tie 3–2 on aggregate while the player only took part in 16 league matches, with his team ending fourth.\n\nVicente made an impressive comeback, scoring the first goal in Valencia's 3–0 win against IF Elfsborg in the Champions League third qualifying round at the Mestalla Stadium. However, another injury occurred shortly after, this time during training, and he would end up spending another large spell in the sidelines, being limited to just 17 appearances in the league.\n\nDisappointed, the player publicly blamed the medical staff for his continuing injuries: \n\n\"My morale is very low. I’ve lost all confidence in the medical staff, that's it. I’ve been defending them for the last two years, but I don’t see any of this situation improving, when I’m still not recovered from one injury I get worse, or suffer from another one. They give me an injection and then I can’t move myself for a week because of the pain\".\n\n\"On top of this, then they tell me maybe my injury doesn’t exist, and it is psychological. It's very hard, I can’t stand it any longer. I’ve lost all confidence in the doctor, but I don’t want to be bad to anyone, but the person who loses the most is me, because I can neither play football nor help my teammates. I only ask to play twenty minutes in one go.\n\n\"That is the worst part about it all, to know that when I have the opportunity to play with good health, things turn out well for me, and I play well, I can help the team,\" he concluded.\nValencia responded that they would open disciplinary proceedings against Vicente after these statements, citing: 'The club will take the necessary action against the player depending on whether his conduct is considered a 'serious' or 'very serious' offence under internal regulations'. The \"injury saga\" came to an end when the player was fined €1,200 following controversial remarks made regarding the club's medical staff.\n\nIn 2008–09, although playing fewer minutes, Vicente was able to contribute more regularly, while competing for first-choice status with young Juan Mata. He came from the bench in the season opener, a 3–0 home win over RCD Mallorca, and, majorly used as a substitute (usually for Mata) during the season, still contributed with six league goals.\n\nVicente's fitness problems persisted in the following campaign, as he only made his first appearance on 6 January 2010, replacing Mata for the final 15 minutes of a 1–2 home loss against Deportivo de La Coruña in the first leg of the Copa del Rey's round-of-16. He still managed to take part in 11 league games, slowly trying to regain his best form; aged 29, he was released by the club after a link that lasted 11 years.\n\nOn 2 September 2011, Vicente signed a one-year deal with Football League Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion. On the 21st, he made his official debut for the club, in a 1–2 home loss against Liverpool for the season's Football League Cup, winning a penalty which resulted in the Ashley Barnes goal.\n\nVicente scored his first goal for Brighton in a 1–3 away defeat against Ipswich Town, on 1 October 2011. However, he was afflicted by injury soon after, and was out for over three months. He returned on 4 February 2012 to provide the assist for Will Buckley's winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Leicester City; the following weekend, also from the bench, he set up two goals in a 2–1 win against Leeds United at Elland Road.\n\nOn 10 March 2012, Brighton beat Portsmouth 2–0 at home, with Vicente scoring a brace – including one from a low free kick – lifting his team into the play-off places and stretching its unbeaten run to 12 games. On 16 May of the following year, after only 12 appearances during the season, he was released alongside Gary Dicker and Marcos Painter; following his departure he described his former boss, Gustavo Poyet, as “the worst person I’ve come across in football”, “selfish” and “egocentric”.\n\nOn 17 April 2014, Vicente announced his retirement from football. In January 2016, he returned to work with Valencia as a member of the technical staff.\n\nVicente made his debut for Spain in a friendly against France on 28 March 2001, replacing Pedro Munitis in the 72nd minute of a 2–1 win at the Mestalla. He was overlooked for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by South Korea and Japan.\n\nVicente appeared in his first major tournament at the UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal, playing in three complete group stage matches. Constant injuries would mean he would also fail to make the final cut for the 2006 World Cup, Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup.\n\nValencia\n\n"}
{"id": "2079943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079943", "title": "Jack Ramsay", "text": "Jack Ramsay\n\nJohn Travilla Ramsay (February 21, 1925 – April 28, 2014) was an American basketball coach, commonly known as \"Dr. Jack\" (as he held an earned doctorate). He was best known for leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA Title, and for his broadcasting work with the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat, and for ESPN TV and ESPN Radio. Ramsay was among the most respected coaches in NBA history and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was the winner of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award for the 2009–10 NBA season.\n\nGrowing up in Milford, Connecticut, Jack Ramsay was encouraged to participate in sports in grade school by his parents, Anne and John. With his family moving to a Philadelphia suburb, Ramsay graduated from Upper Darby High School in 1942. Years after playing basketball, baseball and soccer in high school, he was inducted into the school's Wall of Fame in 1979. Strongly encouraged by his mother to attend college, Ramsay entered Saint Joseph's College. Ramsay's college career was interrupted by three years of service in the US Navy during World War II. Ramsay played both basketball and baseball at St. Joseph's. In his senior year, Ramsay was coached in baseball by Pep Young, a teammate of professional baseball star Ty Cobb. In 1949, Ramsay became the first member of his family to receive a college bachelor's degree. In 1962, Ramsay obtained his master's degree and in 1963 his doctorate degree in education, both from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter graduation, Ramsay played six seasons of professional basketball in the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League. As a sophomore playing guard, he was the second-leading scorer for the Harrisburg Senators in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ramsay averaged 14 points in his career playing for the Senators and the Sunbury, Pennsylvania professional team. To supplement his playing income, he coached basketball at St. James High School for Boys in Chester, Pennsylvania and later at Mount Pleasant High School, 1953-4, in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nAfter coaching in the high school and minor-league ranks during the early postwar years, Ramsay became head coach at St Joseph's in 1955. Ramsay got the job after accidentally meeting the college's moderator of athletics at a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game. Ramsay was hired as coach for the 1955-56 basketball season for $3,500.\n\nIn Ramsay's first season at St Joseph, the Hawks went 23-6 to win their first Big 5 crown. This first season also marked the school's first-ever postseason playoff berth, in which St Joseph placed third in the NIT after losing to the University of Dayton. Ramsay would remain at St. Joseph's through 1966, leading the Hawks to six more Big 5 crowns, five straight seasons of first-place finishes in the Middle Atlantic Conference, ten postseason appearances, and a Final Four stint in 1961.\n\nAt age 41, after leading his team to a 24-5 record in 1965-66, Ramsay was diagnosed with an edema on the retina of his right eye. Ramsay left his coaching job with the Hawks on the doctors' recommendation that he reduce stress. Ramsay finished with a record of 234-72 in 11 years. He would remain the winningest coach in St. Joseph's history until Phil Martelli passed him in 2005.\n\nAfter leaving St Joseph's, Ramsay was hired as general manager by the Philadelphia 76ers. Team owner Irv Kosloff gave Ramsay a three-year $25,000 deal. In Ramsay's first season, the 76ers won the NBA title after finishing 68–13, then the best record in NBA history. The team averaged 125 points with Wilt Chamberlain contributing an average of 24 points, 24 rebounds and eight assists per game. However, Ramsay was forced to trade Chamberlain and Chet Walker, receiving little value in return.\n\nIn 1968, Ramsay became the 76ers head coach. In Ramsay's first game coaching an NBA team, the 76ers zone press won 114–96 against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Spectrum, even though Lakers players Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Chamberlain combined for 71 points. The 76ers finished that first season with Coach Ramsay 55–27. The 76ers led the NBA in scoring (119 points per game) as a result of Ramsay's style of aggressive pressing defense.\n\nIn his four seasons as 76ers coach, Ramsay led the team to three playoff appearances. While the 76ers continued to be contenders, the team was much weaker than in previous seasons. The team's collapse came in 1971–72, when the 76ers posted to 30–52 record and missed the playoffs for the first time in team history.\n\nAfter the 1971–72 season, Ramsay became the head coach of the Buffalo Braves. After compiling a losing 21–61 record in that first season in Buffalo, Ramsay had the team double their win total the next season by finishing first among the league's 17 teams in offense (111.6) even though they were last in defense (111.8). That second season in Buffalo had Ramsay leading the Braves to the playoffs, where they pushed the eventual champion Celtics to six games in the conference semifinals. His Buffalo tenure was almost a mirror image of his time with the Sixers—four seasons, three playoff berths; however, he did not leave Buffalo in the sort of wreckage that had occurred in Philadelphia. Instead, owner Paul Snyder was in the process of selling the team to out-of-town interests (the economy of Western New York was unable to support both the Braves and hockey's Sabres as evidenced by the Braves' attendance figures at the time but Snyder lost interest) and Ramsay requested not to be a part of the upheaval. In his four seasons with the Braves, Ramsay compiled a record of 158–170.\n\nIn 1976, Ramsay became the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers. When Ramsay arrived, the Blazers had not made the playoffs or compiled a winning season record in their six-year history. However, a young Blazers team, led by Bill Walton, was starting to gel. Ramsay also benefited from the 1976 ABA dispersal draft, in which the Blazers obtained power forward Maurice Lucas.\n\nIn his first season in Portland (1977), Ramsay led the Blazers to their first NBA title. In his second season, the Blazers were 50–10 after 60 games and favored to repeat as NBA champions. However, Walton broke his foot, ending the Blazers' winning prospects. Ramsay continued to coach the Blazers until 1986 with general success. However, he never equaled the achievements of his first seasons. During Ramsay's last nine seasons in Portland, the Blazers only won two playoff series. He also coached the Western Conference side in the 1978 All-Star Game.\n\nRamsay took over as coach of the Indiana Pacers for the 1986–87 season. Ramsay coached the Pacers to their second winning record as an NBA team. However, Ramsay was unable to duplicate that success in later seasons. Ramsay resigned as Pacers coach during the 1988–89 season after a 0–7 start.\n\nWhen Ramsay left the Pacers, he was second on the all-time wins list for NBA coaches with 864 wins, trailing only Red Auerbach. When he retired, Ramsay had the most combined college and professional wins of any coach. In 1992, Ramsay was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. The Trail Blazers retired Number 77 in Ramsay's honor on Jan. 14, 1993, symbolically recognizing the 1977 Championship. In 1996, he was voted one of the 10 greatest coaches in NBA history.\n\nAfter his coaching career ended, Ramsay spent nine years as a television color commentator for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Miami Heat. The games were broadcast from South Florida's Sunshine Network (now Sun Sports), Fox Sports Florida, and sometimes local Miami station WBFS (then a UPN affiliate). Ramsay worked alongside announcer Eric Reid.\n\nDuring Ramsay's tenure as Heat commentator, he developed some memorable nicknames and phrases for the Heat players. Whenever point guard Tim Hardaway made a three-point shot, Ramsay shouted, \"this away, that away, Hardaway!\" When Alonzo Mourning dunked the ball, Ramsay exclaimed \"Zo with the stuffa!\". Whenever a Heat player made a nice shot, Ramsay screamed \"bottom of the net!\"\n\nBetween 1996 and 2012, Ramsay called 15 NBA Finals for ESPN Radio, serving as the network's top analyst. He joined ESPN from the Heat full-time in 2000.\n\nIn addition to his TV and radio work, Ramsay authored several books, including \"The Coach's Art\" () and \"Dr. Jack's Leadership Lessons Learned From a Lifetime in Basketball\" ().\n\nRamsay's son-in-law Jim O'Brien has been the head coach of the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, Indiana Pacers and The University of Dayton, and grandson Jack O'Brien was the editor-in-chief of humor website Cracked.com. Grandson Geoff Dailey played baseball at Wesleyan University. His two eldest children, Susan and John, have doctoral degrees and taught at the college level. Another son, John, was an assistant dean at Carleton College. Ramsay counted on the late David Halberstam and Gay Talese as his friends. Ramsay was a devout Roman Catholic. An avid amateur tennis player, Ramsay and Van Miller (the Braves' radio announcer and a close friend of Ramsay's) often played as a doubles team.\n\nRamsay had a pair of concussions in his playing career; one happened while playing a college game in 1948, the second in 1954 during an Eastern League game. In 1999, a routine medical exam revealed an early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The ensuing therapy led to a successful treatment that Ramsay didn't miss a single game that season as commentator. In October 2004, Ramsay was diagnosed with melanoma. He had another bout with the disease in his later years. On May 10, 2013, Ramsay announced that he was again starting cancer treatment, ending his broadcasting career.\n\nRamsay died of cancer in his sleep the night of April 28, 2014. He was 89. Ramsay's longtime employer ESPN announced his death on Twitter.\n\n"}

{"id": "2079955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079955", "title": "Ponzo illusion", "text": "Ponzo illusion\n\nThe Ponzo illusion is a geometrical-optical illusion that was first demonstrated by the Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo (1882–1960) in 1911. He suggested that the human mind judges an object's size based on its background. He showed this by drawing two identical lines across a pair of converging lines, similar to railway tracks. The upper line looks longer because we interpret the converging sides according to linear perspective as parallel lines receding into the distance. In this context, we interpret the upper line as though it were farther away, so we see it as longer – a farther object would have to be longer than a nearer one for both to produce retinal images of the same size.\n\nOne of the explanations for the Ponzo illusion is the \"perspective hypothesis\", which states that the perspective feature in the figure is obviously produced by the converging lines ordinarily associated with distance, that is, the two oblique lines appear to converge toward the horizon or a vanishing point. Another is the \"framing-effects hypothesis\", which says that the difference in the separation or gap of the horizontal lines from the framing converging lines may determine, or at least contribute to the magnitude of the distortion.\n\nThe Ponzo illusion is one possible explanation of the Moon illusion, with objects appearing \"far away\" (because they are \"on\" the horizon) appearing bigger than objects \"overhead\". However, some have argued that explaining one perception (\"appears far away\") in terms of another (\"appears bigger\") is problematic scientifically, and that there are probably complex internal processes behind these illusions.\n\nThe Ponzo illusion also occurs in touch and with an auditory-to-visual sensory-substitution device. However, prior visual experience seems mandatory to perceive it as demonstrated by the fact that congenitally blind subjects are not sensitive to it.\n\nThe Ponzo illusion has also been used to demonstrate a dissociation between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action (see Two-streams hypothesis). Thus, the scaling of grasping movements directed towards objects embedded within a Ponzo illusion is not subject to the size illusion. In other words, the opening between the index finger and thumb is scaled to the real not the apparent size of the target object as the grasping hand approaches the object.\n\nCross-cultural differences in susceptibility to the Ponzo illusion have been noted, with non-Western and rural people showing less susceptibility. Other recent research suggests that an individual's receptivity to this illusion, as well as the Ebbinghaus illusion, may be inversely correlated with the size of that individual's primary visual cortex.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2079956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079956", "title": "Basil Champneys", "text": "Basil Champneys\n\nBasil Champneys (17 September 1842 – 5 April 1935) was an English architect and author whose most notable buildings include Manchester's John Rylands Library, Somerville College Library (Oxford), Newnham College, Cambridge, Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, Mansfield College, Oxford and Oriel College, Oxford's Rhodes Building.\n\nChampneys was born in Whitechapel, London, on 17 September 1842 into a family with a modest income, his father, William Weldon Champneys, was an Evangelical Vicar of St Mary's Church, Whitechapel (later Dean of Lichfield). His mother, Mary Anne, was fourth daughter of the goldsmith and silversmith Paul Storr (his cousins thus including Rev. Vernon Storr, Archdeacon of Westminster from 1931 to 1936, Rev. Frank Utterton, Archdeacon of Surrey from 1906 to 1908, the artists Rex Whistler and Laurence Whistler, and the academic Michael Lindsay, 2nd Baron Lindsay of Birker). One of eight children, he attended Charterhouse School, showing a talent for mathematics and lacking in drawing skills. In 1860, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1864, he failed to get the 'first class' degree he had hoped for, achieving a second class in the Classical Tripos, and he took articles to study as an architect with John Prichard, the Surveyor of Llandaff Cathedral. Champneys set up his practice as an architect in 1867 in Queen's Square, London, close to the office of Morris & Co.\n\nIn 1876 he married May Theresa Ella, a daughter of Maurice Drummond, descendant of William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan, and they had two sons and two daughters. Champneys was a member of the Century Guild, the Athenaeum Club and the Saville Club, making acquaintances with Walter Pater, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sidney Colvin, and Coventry Patmore. In 1912 the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded Champneys its Royal Gold Medal for architecture. Champneys died at his home, 42 Frognall Lane, Hampstead, on 5 April 1935. He was the brother of Brasenose rowers Weldon Champneys (clergyman) and Sir Francis Champneys (doctor).\n\nHis writings include an introduction to \"Henry Merritt: Art Criticism and Romance\", published in 1879 and \"Churches about Queen Victoria Street\", a portfolio published in 1871, \"Victorian art and originality\" for the \"British Architect\" published in 1887, and \"The architecture of Queen Victoria's reign\" for the \"Art Journal\", published in 1887. \"A Quiet Corner of England: Studies of Landscape and Architecture in Winchelsea, Rye and Romney Marsh\" was published in 1875 after being circulated as a portfolio and a work regarding his mother-in-law, Adelaide Drummond, \"A Retrospect and Memoir\", was published in 1915. Champneys' correspondence has been preserved in the General Collection of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.\n\nBelieving that architecture was 'an art not a science' he joined the Art Workers Guild instead of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Although Champneys was able to work in the Gothic style that John Prichard preferred and taught, he later became one of the pioneers of the Queen Anne style, working on at least 100 buildings throughout England. John Rylands' widow, Enriqueta Rylands, had admired the library Champneys had designed for Mansfield College, Oxford and hired him to develop the design on a more lavish scale – The John Rylands Memorial Library in Deansgate, Manchester took nine years to build before opening on 1 January 1900, it is one of Champneys' finest designs.\nChampneys' Oxford buildings include the Church of St Peter-le-Bailey (1872–1874), which serves as the chapel for St Peter's College, New Old Hall in Lady Margaret Hall (1881-1883), the Indian Institute (1883–1896), the Mansfield College library (1886–1889), the Robinson Tower at New College (1896), the Somerville College Library (1903), the St. Alban Hall buildings at Merton College (1905–1910), a chapel and residence hall at Linacre College (1907-1909), the Rhodes Building in Oriel College (1908–1911).\n\nHis Cambridge works include the Archaeological Museum (1883), now Peterhouse Theatre, the Divinity and Literary School and Newnham College (between 1875 and 1910), for which he is credited for bringing a 'touch of lightness' to the college and is acknowledged for his attention to both construction details, and to cost.\n\nChampneys' buildings elsewhere include the chapel of Mill Hill School, London (1898), buildings for Bedford College in Regent's Park (1910), King Edward VII School (King's Lynn) (1910–1913), the Butler Museum at Harrow School (1886), the museum at Winchester College (1898), and Bedford High School (1878–1892). Champneys also designed the Wilnecote Board School buildings as a slightly earlier work in 1877; this building is in danger of demolition due to Staffordshire County Council wishing to give the land away to a land developer. Churches by Champneys include his father's parish church, St Luke's, Kentish Town (1867–1870), the sailors' church of St Mary Star of the Sea, Hastings (1878), and St Chad, Slindon, Staffordshire (1894). In 1897 he did the painting of clouds, cherubs and scrolls on the ceiling of St George the Martyr Southwark in London. In 1898 he added a porch to St Mary, Manchester, where he was surveyor, and between 1902 and 1903, a south annexe. His home, Hall Oak, in Frognal, Hampstead was also one of his works.\n\n\n"}

PHR headquarters are in New York City, with offices in Boston and Washington, D.C. It was established in 1986 to use the unique skills and credibility of health professionals to advocate for persecuted health workers, prevent torture, document mass atrocities, and hold those who violate human rights accountable.\n\nIn 1981, Dr. Jonathan Fine, a primary care physician in Boston, was asked to fly to Chile on short notice and lead a delegation seeking the release of three prominent physicians by General Augusto Pinochet’s regime. The three Chilean doctors were released five weeks after Dr. Fine's visit.\n\nIn 1986, recognizing the impact physicians could have in the human rights field, Dr. Fine co-founded Physicians for Human Rights with Dr. Jane Green Schaller, Dr. Robert Lawrence, Dr. Jack Geiger, and Dr. Carola Eisenberg.\n\nSince the organization’s founding, PHR teams have exposed the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Iraq, exhumed mass graves in Bosnia and Rwanda for international tribunals, and provided evidence for criminal investigations into torture and extrajudicial executions in countries such as Colombia, Honduras, Libya, Mexico, Peru, and Sierra Leone. In 1997, the organization shared the Nobel Peace Prize for medically documenting landmine injuries and serving as a leader in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.\n\nPHR has also been at the forefront in developing standards for human rights abuse documentation: staff member Dr. Vincent Iacopino played a lead role in developing the Istanbul Protocol, the recognized international standard for documenting torture and ill treatment. Likewise, the Director of the International Forensics Program was involved in the revision process of the Minnesota Protocol, the international guidance on the investigation of potentially unlawful death. Governments, United Nations agencies, international and national courts, and other human rights organizations have all sought PHR’s forensic and research expertise. The organization’s work has contributed to landmark decisions such as the 2016 conviction of Radovan Karadžić.\n\nHealth professionals in PHR’s International Forensics Program (IFP) use forensic investigations such as autopsies and medical and psychological evaluations, to determine the nature of abuse that victims have endured. These evaluations can then contribute to evidence for prosecutions or be used to bring attention to crimes. The IFP has performed forensic investigations for bodies such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n\nExperts in the IFP range from forensic pathologists to forensic anthropologists, as well as analytical scientists such as firearm examiners. They perform forensic investigations, evaluations, monitoring, or review of other parties’ forensic work.\n\nPHR launched the Forensic Training Institute (FTI) to strengthen local capacities for forensic investigations and documentation. The institute seeks to strengthen the ability of medical personnel to document torture, mass atrocities, sexual violence, and the persecution of health care workers. It also trains legal and law enforcement professionals who seek redress via local, national, and international justice mechanisms.\n\nPHR’s FTI program has partners in Afghanistan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Syria, Tajikistan, and the United States. The program has specifically helped clinicians strengthen their interviewing techniques, physical examinations, evidence collection, crime scene documentation, forensic photography, and grave exhumation.\n\nPHR’s Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones was launched in 2011. The program strengthens cross-sectoral responses to sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya through training workshops for health care, law enforcement, and legal professionals. While PHR itself has engaged in many forensic investigations and advocacy efforts around rape in armed conflict, the Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones builds local capacities for the collection of court-admissible evidence to support prosecutions for sexual violence crimes.\n\nThe program has an office at renowned gynecological surgeon Dr. Denis Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital, in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo. The Program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones partners with Panzi Hospital to train and mentor health workers, police officers, lawyers, and judges in effective documentation and prosecution of sexual violence.\n\nTo aid the documentation of sexual violence, PHR has developed MediCapt, an app allowing the secure digital recording and transmission of medical evidence.\n\nPHR’s Asylum Program advocates for improved conditions in U.S. immigration detention centers and documents abuses suffered by asylum seekers in their home countries and in U.S. care. The network consists of hundreds of volunteer health professionals who provide medical evaluations to survivors of human rights violations, strengthening their applications for asylum in the United States.\n\nPHR’s documentation of abuses has involved investigations into the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention facilities, indefinite detention, and violations of the right to health in detention.\n\nIn 2010, PHR partnered with Weill Cornell Medicine to create the Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights (WCCHR), a medical student-run human rights clinic that assists survivors of torture seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nPHR’s U.S. Anti-Torture Program (ATP) was launched in 2003, after reports of torture by U.S. military personnel were first exposed. PHR published a series of investigative reports documenting the U.S. government’s use of torture in pursuit of national security goals. ”Break Them Down,” published in 2005, found evidence of the systematic psychological torture employed by the military. Additional reports documented the severe physical and mental harm inflicted by interrogation practices and human experimentation in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe research and investigations department at PHR documents human rights abuses around the world. Their areas of research include attacks on health care and health personnel, mass atrocities, torture, and sexual violence across the globe. Notable investigations include:\n\n1988 — PHR researchers uncover evidence of the Iraqi government using chemical weapons on their Kurdish citizens.\n\n1996 — PHR teams exhumes mass graves in the Balkans. They provided evidence of ethnic cleansing to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). This work contributed to the ICTY’s conviction of Radovan Karadžić of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity.\n\n1996 — PHR sends a team to exhume mass graves in Rwanda and eventually provides forensic evidence to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n\n2004 — PHR researchers investigate mass killings in Darfur. The organization is the first to call the events genocide.\n2010 — PHR begins a successful global lobbying campaign to free Dr. Kamiar Alaei and Dr. Arash Alaei, brothers imprisoned in Iran for their work on the treatment of people with HIV/AIDS.\n\n2011 — PHR researchers begin documenting assaults on Syrian health care workers and infrastructure, creating an interactive map of attacks and revealing the Syrian government’s systemic targeting of hospitals and health workers.\n\n2015 — PHR issues a report on the state of health care in eastern Aleppo city after almost five years of the Syrian conflict, revealing that almost 95% of doctors had fled, been detained, or been killed.\n\n2019 — published report, \"My Only Crime Was That I Was a Doctor\" about Assad's targeting of medical personnel and civilians in Syria.\n\nPHR’s National Student Program engages medical students and young health professionals in health and human rights work by organizing local action on human rights issues, raising awareness on campuses, organizing educational events, and calling on elected officials to take action. PHR has student chapters across the United States, and collaborates with them through PHR’s university-affiliated asylum clinics and national student conferences.\n\nThe program has created tools and resources for student chapters covering topics such as medical professionalism, health and human rights education, and the Istanbul Protocol.\n\nAfter their 1991 investigation of the health impact of land mines in Cambodia, PHR, in collaboration with Human Rights Watch, published the first report calling for a ban on landmines. In 1992, PHR helped form the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, participating in the talks that led to the Ottawa Treaty. For their work, PHR shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize “for their work for the banning and clearing of anti-personnel mines.”\n\n\nYouTube, \"Physicians for Human Rights: A Snapshot of Our Work Around the World.\"\n\nCharity Navigator, \"Physicians for Human Rights.\"\n"}

Latin and Classical Greek are also offered and may be taken at SL or HL. To earn an IB Diploma, a candidate must study an additional language, though a second Language A may be taken instead of studying that language as a Group 2 subject.\n\nIf a student has no previous background in a given language, then that student may study that language as an \"ab initio\" SL subject. Such a course focuses on giving the student basic knowledge of both the language in everyday use and the culture of the places where it is spoken. The standard reached by the student after two years is considerably lower than that reached in language B.\n\nThe Classical Languages (Latin and Classical Greek) are not offered as Language \"ab initio\" courses.\n\nFor students to achieve communicative competence in a variety of situations, the following core topics are explored in the Language \"ab initio\" course: the individual, education and work, town and services, food and drink, leisure and travel, the environment, health and emergencies.\nThe language skills that are taught and assessed are: listening, reading, writing, speaking and cultural awareness.\n\n\"Internal Assessment\" — (30% of total grade) for a Language \"ab initio\" consists of the average of two oral presentations, one of which is to be given to the teacher, recorded and sent out for moderation.

He ascended to throne after competing with his brothers. He expanded his kingdom and made expeditions to help neighbouring kingdoms. In 1532, Gujarat came under attack of the Mughal Emperor Humayun and fell. Bahadur Shah regained the kingdom in 1536 but he was killed by the Portuguese on board the ship when making a deal with them.\n\nBahadur Shah's father was Shams-ud-Din Muzaffar Shah II, who had ascended to the throne of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1511. Muzaffar Shah II nominated Sikandar Shah (Bahadur Shah's elder brother) as the heir apparent to the throne. Bahadur Khan's relationship with his brother and father became tense as Sikandar Shah began to assume greater administrative control. Fearing for his life, Bahadur Khan fled Gujarat, first seeking refuge with Chittor, and then with Ibrahim Lodi. He was present at the Battle of Panipat, though he did not take part in fighting.\n\nAfter death of Muzaffar Shah II in 1526, Sikandar Sháh succeeded. After few weeks in power, he was murdered on the instructions of his slave Imád-ul-Mulk Khush Kadam, who seated an infant brother of Sikandar's, named Násir Khán, on the throne with the title of Mahmud Shah II and governed on his behalf. Three other princes were poisoned. The only event of Sikandar's reign was the destruction of an army sent against his brother Latíf Khán who was helped by Rána Bhím of Munga (now Chhota Udaipur). When Bhadur Khan received the news of the death of his father, he returned to Gujarat. The nobles deserted Imád-ul-Mulk's cause, and prince Báhádur Khán, was joined by many supporters prominent among whom was Táj Khán, proprietor of Dhandhuka. Bahádur marched at once on Chámpáner, captured and executed Imád-ul-Mulk and poisoning Násir Khán ascended the throne in 1527 with the title of Bahádur Sháh.\n\nHis brother Latíf Khán, aided by Rája Bhím of the Kohistan or hill land of Pál (Pal-Dadhvav, near Bhuloda, Gujarat), now asserted his claim to the throne. He was defeated, and fell wounded into the hands of the Gujarát army and died of his wounds and was buried at Halol. Rája Bhím was slain. As Bhím's successor Ráisingh plundered Dahod, a large force was sent against him, commanded by Táj Khán, who laid waste Ráisingh's country and dismantled his forts. Only one of his brother, Chand Khan survived, as he had refuge at the Malwa court and the Sultan Mahmud II of Malwa refused to surrender him.\n\nDuring his reign, Gujarat was under pressure from the expanding Mughal Empire under emperors Babur (died 1530) and Humayun (1530–1540), and from the Portuguese, who were establishing fortified settlements on the Gujarat coast to expand their power in India from their base in Goa.\n\nSoon after Bahádur Sháh visited Cambay, and found that Malik Is-hák the governor of Sorath and son of Malik Ayyaz, had, in the interests of the Portuguese, attempted to seize Diu but had been repulsed by the Gujarát admiral Mahmúd Áka. The Sultán entrusted Diu to Kiwám-ul-Mulk and Junágaḍh to Mujáhid Khán Bhíkan and returned to Áhmedábád. In 1527 he enforced tribute from Ídar and the neighbouring country. During one of his numerous expeditions he went to hunt in Nándod and received the homage of the Rája.\n\nAs the Portuguese were endeavouring to establish themselves on the coast of Sorath, and, if possible, to obtain Diu, the king was constantly at Cambay (now Khambhat), Diu and Ghogha to frustrate their attempts, and he now directed the construction of the fortress of Bharuch. At this time Muhammad Khán, ruler of Asír and Burhánpur (both of Khandesh), requested Bahádur's aid on behalf of Imád-ul-Mulk, ruler of Berar. Bahádur Sháh started at once and at Nandurbár was joined by Muhammad Khán Asíri, and thence proceeded to Burhánpur, where he was met by Imád Sháh from Gávalgad. After certain successes he made peace between Burhán Nizám Sháh and Imád Sháh Gávali, and returned to Gujarát.\n\nJám Fírúz the ruler of Thatta in Sindh now sought refuge with Bahádur Sháh from the oppression either of the Ghoris or of the Mughals and was hospitably received. In 1528 Bahádur made an expedition into the Deccan which ended in a battle at Daulatabad. Later he was forced to retire because of the stiff resistance put up by the Ahmadnagar army. Next year (1529) at the request of Jaâfar or Khizr Khán, son of Imád Sháh Gávali, who was sent to Gujarát to solicit Bahádur's help, he again marched for the Deccan. As he passed through Muler Biharji the Rája of Báglán gave him his daughter in marriage and in return received the title of Bahr Khán. From Báglán Bahr Khán was told off to ravage Chaul which by this time had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese. Bahádur himself advanced to Ahmednagar, took the fort and destroyed many of the buildings. Purandhar also was sacked of its stores of gold. From Ahmednagar, Bahádur Sháh passed to Burhánpur, and there his general Kaisar Khán gained a victory over the united forces of Nizám Sháh, Malik Beríd, and Ain-ul-Mulk. Finally, both the rulers of the Ahmadnagar and Berar were forced to sign a humiliating treaty. Bahádur returned to Gujarát and for some time refrained from interfering in the affairs of the Deccan.\n\nBetween 1526 and 1530, certain Turks under one Mústafa came to Gujarát, traders according to one account according to another part of a Turkish fleet expected to act against the Portuguese. Diu was assigned them as a place of residence and the command of the island was granted to Malik Túghán, son of Malik Ayyáz, the former governor.\n\nBahadur Shah had sent a delegation headed by ‘Abd al-‘Aziz Asaf Khan to Ottoman Empire in 1530s.\n\nIn 1530 the king marched to Nágor, and gave an audience both to Prathiráj Rája of Dungarpur] and to the ambassadors from Rána Ratansi of Chittor. The Rána's ambassadors complained of encroachments on Chittor by Mahmúd II of Malwa Sultanate. Mahmúd promised to appear before Bahádur to explain the alleged encroachments. Bahádur waited. At last as Mahmúd failed to attend Bahádur said he would go and meet Mahmúd. He invested Mándu and received with favour certain deserters from Mahmúd's army. The fortress fell and Sultán Mahmúd and his seven sons were captured without any resistance on March 28, 1531 Mandu. Malwa was annexed into his kingdom.\n\nAfter passing the rainy season at Mándu, Bahádur Sháh went to Burhánpur to visit his nephew Mirán Muhammad Sháh. At Burhánpur, Bahádur under the influence of the great priest-statesman Sháh Táhir, was reconciled with Burhán Nizám and gave him the royal canopy he had taken from Málwa. Bahádur offered Sháh Táhir the post of minister. Sháh Táhir declined saying he must make a pilgrimage to Mecca. He retired to Ahmednagar and there converted Burhán Nizám Sháh to the Shia Islam.\n\nIn the same year, hearing that Mánsingji, Rája of Halvad, had killed the commandant of Dasada, Bahádur despatched Khán Khánán against him. Viramgam and Mándal were taken over from the Jhála chieftains, and ever after formed part of the crown dominions.\n\nWhen Malwa's Sultán Mahmúd II and his sons were being conveyed to the fortress of Champaner, Ráisingh, Rája of Pál, endeavoured to rescue them. The attempt failed, and the prisoners were put to death by their guards. In 1531, on Bahádur's return from Burhánpur to Dhár, hearing that Silehdi, the Rájput chief of Ráisin in east Málwa kept in captivity certain women who had belonged to the harem of Sultán Násir-ud-dín of Málwa, Bahádur marched against him and forced him to surrender and embrace Islám. The chief secretly sent to the Rána of Chitor for aid and delayed handing over Ráisin. On learning this Bahádur dispatched a force to keep Chitor in check and pressed the siege. At his own request, Silehdi was sent to persuade the garrison to surrender. But their reproaches stung him so sharply, that, joining with them, they sallied forth sword in hand and were all slain. Ráisin fell into Bahádur's hands, and this district together with those of Bhilsa and Chanderi were entrusted to the government of Sultán Alam Lodhi. The king now went to Gondwana to hunt elephants, and, after capturing many, employed his army in reducing Gagraon and other minor fortresses. In 1532, he advanced against Chittor, but raised the siege on receiving an enormous ransom. Shortly afterwards his troops took the strong fort of Ranthambhore.\n\nAbout this time on receipt of news that the Portuguese were usurping authority, the Sultán repaired to Diu. Before he arrived the Portuguese had taken to flight, leaving behind them an enormous gun which the Sultán ordered to be dragged to Chámpáner.\n\nBefore 1532 was over, Bahádur Sháh quarrelled with Humayun, the Mughal emperor of Delhi. The original ground of quarrel was that Bahádur Sháh had sheltered Sultán Muhammad Zamán Mírza, the grandson of a daughter of the emperor Babar (1482–1530). Humáyún's anger was increased by an insolent answer from Bahadur Shah. Without considering that he had provoked a powerful enemy, Bahádur Sháh again laid siege to Chittor, and though he heard that Humáyún had arrived at Gwalior, he would not desist from the siege. In March 1535 Chittor fell into the hands of the Gujarát king but near Mandasúr his army was shortly afterwards routed by Humáyún. According to one account, the failure of the Gujarát army was due to Bahádur and his nobles being spell-bound by looking at a heap of salt and some cloth soaked in indigo which were mysteriously left before Bahádur's tent by an unknown elephant. The usual and probably true explanation is that Rúmi Khán the Turk, head of the Gujarát artillery, betrayed Bahádur's interest. Still though Rúmi Khán's treachery may have had a share in Bahádur's defeat it seems probable that in valour, discipline, and tactics the Gujarát army was inferior to the Mughals. Bahádur Sháh, unaccustomed to defeat, lost heart and fled to Mandu, which fortress was speedily taken by Humáyún. From Mándu the king fled to Chámpáner, and finally took refuge in Diu. Chámpáner fell to Humáyún, and the whole of Gujarát, except Sorath, came under his rule.\n\nAt this time Sher Sháh Súr revolted, in Bihar and Jaunpur, and Humáyún returned to Agra to oppose him leaving his brother Hindál Mírza in Áhmedábád, Kásam Beg in Bharuch, and Yádgár Násir Mírza in Pátan. As soon as Humáyún departed, the country rose against the Mughals, and his old nobles requested the king to join them. Bahádur joined them, and, defeating the Mughals at Kaníj village near Mahmúdábád (now Mahemdavad), expelled them from Gujarát.\n\nWhile, Bahadur was engaged in the siege of Mandu against the Mughal, a strong Portuguese fleet sailed from Bombaim (now Mumbai), led by Nuno da Cunha. On February 7, 1531 the fleet reached near Shiyal Bet island, which they captured overcoming in spite of strong resistance. On February 16, 1531 they started bombarding Diu but could not succeed to inflict any appreciable damage to its fortification. On March 1, 1531 Nuno da Cunha left for Goa, leaving a subordinate officer, who systematically destroyed Mahuva, Ghogha, Valsad, Mahim, Kelva, Agashi and Surat.\n\nAs Gujarat fell to the Mughal Empire, Bahadur Shah was forced to court the Portuguese. On 23 December 1534 while on board the galleon \"St. Mattheus\" he signed the Treaty of Bassein. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Portuguese Empire gained control of the city of Bassein (Vasai), as well as its territories, islands, and seas which included Daman and Bombay islands too. He had granted them leave to erect a factory in Diu. Instead of a factory the Portuguese built a Diu Fort. \n\nWhen he recovered his kingdom, Bahádur, repenting of his alliance with the Portuguese, went to Sorath to persuade an army of Portuguese, whom he had asked to come to his assistance, to return to Goa. In February 1537, when the Portuguese arrived at Diu, five or six thousand strong, the Sultán hoping to get rid of them by stratagem, went to Diu and endeavored to get the viceroy into his power. The viceroy excused himself, and in return invited the king to visit his ship anchored off the coast of Gujarat. Bahádur agreed, and on his way back was attacked and killed by the Portuguese and his body was dumped into the Arabian Sea. He was then thirty one years old and in the eleventh year of his reign. According to the author of the \"Mirăt-i-Sikandari\" the reason of Bahádur's assassination was that a paper from him to the kings of the Deccan, inviting them to join him in an alliance against the Portuguese, had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese viceroy. Whatever may have been the provocation or the intention, the result seems to show that while both sides had treacherous designs neither party was able to carry out his original plan, and the end was unpremeditated, hurried on by mutual suspicions. These events were followed by the 1538 Siege of Diu which resulted in the permanent occupation of Diu by Portuguese which lasted till 1961.\n\nUp to the defeat of Sultán Bahádur by Humáyún, the power of Gujarát was at its height. Cadets of noble Rájput houses, Prithiráj, the nephew of Rána Sánga of Chitor, and Narsingh Deva the cousin of the Rája of Gwálior, were proud to enroll themselves as the Sultán's vassals. The Rája of Baglán readily gave Bahádur Sháh his daughter. Jám Fírúz of Thatta in Sindh and the sons of Bahlúl Lodhi were suppliants at his court. Málwa was a dependency of Gujarát and the Nizám Sháhis of Ahmednagar and Nasírkhan of Burhánpur acknowledged him as overlord, while the Fárúkis of Khándesh were dependent on Bahádur's constant help.\n\nHe built the mausoleum at Halol in honour of his brothers and predecessors, Sikandar Shah and Mahmud Shah II.\n\nHe was a great patron of the Hindustani Classical music and its artists, including Baiju Bawra.\n\nBahadur had no son, hence there was some uncertainty regarding succession after his death. Muhammad Zaman Mirza, the fugitive Mughal prince made his claim on the ground that Bahadur's mother adopted him as her son. The nobles selected Bahadur's nephew Miran Muhammad Shah of Khandesh as his successor, but he died on his way to Gujarat. Finally, the nobles selected Mahmud Khan, the son of Bahadur's brother Latif Khan as his successor and he ascended to the throne as Mahmud Shah III on May 10, 1538.\n"}

{"id": "2080008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080008", "title": "Billy Paul", "text": "Billy Paul\n\nPaul Williams (December 1, 1934 – April 24, 2016), known professionally as Billy Paul, was a Grammy Award-winning American soul singer, known for his 1972 No. 1 single \"Me and Mrs. Jones\", as well as the 1973 album and single \"War of the Gods\", which blends his more conventional pop, soul, and funk styles with electronic and psychedelic influences.\n\nHe was one of the many artists associated with the Philadelphia soul sound created by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell. Paul was identified by his diverse vocal style, which ranged from mellow and soulful to low and raspy. Questlove of the Roots equated Paul to Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, calling him \"one of the criminally unmentioned proprietors of socially conscious post-revolution '60s civil rights music.\"\n\nPaul was raised in North Philadelphia. His love of music began at a young age, listening at home to his family's music collection. \n\nHe recalled: \"That's how I really got indoctrinated into music. My mother was always...collecting records and she would buy everything from \"Jazz at Philharmonic Hall\" to Nat King Cole.\" He began singing along and tried to emulate the records he heard: \"I always liked Nat King Cole. I always wanted to go my own way, but I always favored other singers like Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald – I loved Ella Fitzgerald. There are so many of them. Nina Simone was one of my favorites – Johnny Mathis, They all had a style, a silkiness about them... I wanted to sing silky, like butter – mellow. I wanted to sing mellow you know what I mean. One of my favorites is Jessie Belvin – they used to call him Mr. Easy. A lot of people forgot about him you know – Sam Cooke is another one of my favorites.\"\n\nPaul explained why he was particularly influenced by female jazz singers: \"I think the reason behind that is because of my high range. The male singers who had the same range I did, when I was growing up, didn't do much for me. But put on Nina Simone, Carmen McRae or Nancy Wilson, and I'd be in seventh heaven. Female vocalists just did more with their voices, and that's why I paid more attention to them.\" Perhaps the female vocalist who had the most impact on him was Billie Holiday, whom he called \"a BIG influence.\" He began developing a vocal style that would eventually incorporate traces of jazz, R&B, and pop.\n\nHe began his singing career at the age of 11, appearing on local radio station WPEN, then owned by the local \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" newspaper. He attended the West Philadelphia Music School and the Granoff School of Music for formal vocal training. He recalled: \"Well you know, it was something that my mum would say I needed, holding my notes you know, and delivering my notes. It gave me assurity, cos my mother was 100% behind me and it created the style and uniqueness of Billy Paul. All my life I wanted to sound like myself, I never wanted to sound like anybody else. How that occurred was cause I always wanted to be a saxophone player...I took my uniqueness and treated it like a horn, which created a good style for me.\"\n\nPaul's popularity grew and led to appearances in clubs and at college campuses nationally. He changed his name from Paul Williams to Billy Paul so as to avoid any confusion with other artists such as songwriter Paul Williams and saxophonist Paul \"Hucklebuck\" Williams. He explained: \"I had Jules Malvin, who was like my play father. He was my manager at the time. He took me up to the Apollo and I warmed the Apollo for six weeks and that’s where he gave me the name Billy Paul. I didn't question it.\"\n\nIn 1952, he traveled to New York City and entered the recording studio for Jubilee Records. Backed by Tadd Dameron on piano and Jackie Davis on the Hammond organ, Paul released his first single that April: \"Why Am I\" with \"That's Why I Dream\" as the B-side (Jubilee Records 5081, both written by Bernard Sacks and B. Sidney Zeff). \"Billboard\" reviewed the tracks favorably, saying of \"Why Am I\" that it was \"Expressive warbling of a moody ballad, by the label's new 16-year-old chanter\", and of \"That's Why I Dream\": \"Organ and piano lend the singer a hand in this slow-paced etching of a romantic number\".\n\nIn June 1952, Paul released his second single – this time collaborating with the Buddy Lucas Orchestra – \"You Didn't Know\", backed with \"The Stars Are Mine\" (Jubilee Records 5086). \"Billboard\" was again positive, saying about \"You Didn't Know\" – \"Billy Paul, new young singer, makes an impressive bow on the label with a strong performance of a weeper ballad which should pick up spins and plays. The Lucas ork furnishes okay backing. A good disk\" and about \"The Stars Are Mine\" – \"Paul sings this new tune more quietly, over a smooth ork reading. Side is not as exciting as flip and tune is not as strong.\" A few weeks later, Jubilee took out an ad in \"Billboard\" to promote their artists in anticipation of the annual NAMM Show – the music industry trade convention put on by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM). Jubilee plugged Paul's latest single and noted: \"He's New – He's Hot!\" Despite Jubilee's efforts, none of the tracks by the young singer made the charts.\n\nPaul's career took an unexpected turn when he was drafted into the Armed Services. He recalled: \n\nPaul and the other members of the 7th Army Band, including Don Ellis, Leo Wright and Ron Anthony, used the service to further their musical careers as best they could—careers they knew would continue once they returned to civilian life. Paul said: \"I sang in the service, I sang with a jazz band. So when I came out I sang Jazz, going to clubs and so forth.\n\nPaul also did some boxing in the Army – a sport he had grown up with, as he explained in a 2012 interview: \"Yeah we had a gym and all my friends from my neighborhood were boxers. Even during my army days I boxed as well as singing. Actually I still go to the gym; both me and my wife have trainers... Miles Davis would always say: 'Come to the gym! I'm gonna beat your ass!' Then one time I got hit too hard and I said no I'm going to sing!... That made my mind up.\"\n\nAfter his discharge, Paul formed a jazz trio with hard bop pianist Sam Dockery and bassist Buster Williams. In 1959 he joined the New Dawn record label and released the single \"Ebony Woman\" backed with \"You'll Go to Hell\" (New Dawn 1001), both written by Morris Bailey Jr. In 1960, Paul recorded \"There's a Small Hotel\" (Finch 1005, written by Rodgers and Hart), backed with \"I'm Always A Brother\" (Finch 1006, written by Leon Mitchell and Charles Gaston). None of these songs charted, but Paul would resurrect and re-record both \"Ebony Woman\" and \"There's a Small Hotel\" in later years.\n\nPaul was a brief stand-in for one of the ailing Blue Notes with Harold Melvin. Paul remembered: \"Well, I didn’t want to dance so Harold Melvin fired me (laughs). I had a six month stay with the Flamingos – I was with The Flamingos for a while.\" It was around this time that Paul established a lifelong friendship with Marvin Gaye—both singers filling in with other groups. Paul recalled: \"I was one of the Blue Notes at one time and Marvin Gaye was in the Moonglows... We were such good friends. We never did a record together and that would have been one of my dreams. And you know what one of my fascinations is? What we would be doing if he were here today. I think about Marvin every day. The love I have for this man is unbelievable. We were close, we were like brothers. When I would go on the road out in California, he would go round to the house – he and Blanche (Billy's wife) [would] make sure Blanche’s mother would take her insulin because she was a diabetic. I would heavily depend on him to make sure she ate and took her insulin. That’s how close we were. You know sometimes, even today. I wake up and hope it was a dream, but it’s real – it’s real you know.\"\n\nIn 2012, Paul was asked how important the city of Philadelphia was to him and what the Philly sound is: \"It's very very important to me. I was born here and so many great and influential artists come from here as well. Its a city of its own and has its own sound. I think what makes it different is the drama; you know how they say everyone marches to their own beat? Well i think Philly has its own beat as well, and it's distinctive. It sounds easy, but it's hard to play.\"\n\nPaul and his wife and manager Blanche Williams were in the process of recording his debut album when they met Kenny Gamble. Paul recalled:\n\nPaul's debut album \"Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club\" was released in 1968 on the Gamble label. Largely a collection of jazz covers of songs popularized by others, it was a studio album that attempted to recreate the feel of Paul's live club performances. Neither the single \"Bluesette\" nor the album reached the charts. The album was re-released in 1973.\n\nPaul's second LP, \"Ebony Woman\" (1970), was a more commercial release on Gamble & Huff's Neptune label. Paul cut a new version of his 1959 single and made it the title track. Gamble & Huff were firmly in control of the production. Merging jazz and soul, the LP achieved some modest success reaching No. 12 on the \"Billboard\" soul chart an No. 183 on the pop chart.\n\nAfter Neptune folded, Gamble and Huff started their third label – Philadelphia International Records (PIR) – and brought Paul with them. Gamble and Huff signed a distribution deal with Clive Davis and CBS Records.\n\n\"Going East\" (1971) was the first Billy Paul album released on the Philadelphia International Records label, making full use of the label's regular group of ace musicians MFSB at Sigma Sound Studios. As they had done on the previous LP, Gamble and Huff sought to find the balance between Paul's jazz roots and the funky soul that they hoped would bring mainstream success. Paul nearly reached the charts with the single \"Magic Carpet Ride\" (cover of the 1968 Steppenwolf hit) and the album climbed to No. 42 on the \"Billboard\" soul chart and No. 197 on the pop chart.\n\nWith each album, Gamble and Huff were moving closer to realizing the sound they envisioned for Billy Paul, and they achieved it with the 1972 album \"360 Degrees of Billy Paul\" and the single \"Me and Mrs. Jones\". Both the album and song received commercial and critical acclaim.\n\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was a No. 1 hit for the last three weeks of 1972, selling two million copies (platinum single status), and went on to win Paul a Grammy Award. The gold album and platinum single broke the artist on world charts, including the United Kingdom, where the single entered the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 12 in early 1973. In the years since then, the song has been covered numerous times, most notably by the Dramatics in 1974, Freddie Jackson in 1992 and Michael Bublé in 2007. Paul recalled the Grammy win and the song's overall success: \"Oh man! I was up against Ray Charles, I was up against Curtis Mayfield, I was up against Isaac Hayes. I was in the Wilberforce University in Ohio, I had to go do a homecoming – my wife and her mother went. And when I see Ringo Starr call my name, I said Ohhh... Yeah... The most sobering thing is to have a number one record across the whole entire world in all languages. It’s a masterpiece, it’s a classic.\"\n\nThe song was PIR's first No. 1. In addition, the label was enjoying considerable success with their other artists, including the O'Jays and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. Paul remembered the atmosphere at the label: \"It was like a family full of music. It was like music round the clock, you know.\"\n\nBut Paul's massive success was short-lived. The follow-up single – \"Am I Black Enough for You?\" – failed to reach the heights of \"Mrs. Jones\", with the song's Black Power political message proving too much for mainstream radio's taste. There was and continues to be much controversy surrounding the choice to release this track as the follow-up to a cross-over smash hit.\n\nIn a 1977 interview, Paul made plain that he opposed the choice from the beginning: \nDecades later, Paul was more philosophical about the song: \"That was what I had with 'Am I Black Enough.' I wanted – I'm gonna make it this time and come out. I think it's true to the audience, cos they look for something to come out compared to Mrs. Jones and that was Clive Davis' idea to do that. I think it was Kenny and Clive Davis, but I think it was mostly Clive Davis.\" For his part, Davis has said that he opposed releasing the song as a single. Still, Davis called it an \"all time great record, all time great performance\". Gamble, the co-writer and producer of the track, said the song \"was great and Billy sounded great doing it\". Paul reflected: \"Well you know... For a long time I was angry about it, I had a bit of a letdown. Now the song is ahead of its time. I feel as though I let the song down when I went into my darkness. I feel like I abandoned the song. And I'm still going to get to the bottom of 'Am I Black Enough'.\"\n\nUltimately, \"360 Degrees of Billy Paul\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" soul chart and No. 17 on the pop chart. Despite the disappointment over the chart performance of \"Am I Black Enough\", there was no reason to believe that he could not replicate the album's success or reach even greater heights. In May 1973, while still promoting \"360 Degrees of Billy Paul\", he was asked about a follow-up LP: \"I'm afraid that there will be something of a delay. As of right now, there are two sides actually completed. I have to tell you about one of them — Kenny and Leon wrote it especially and it's a definite single at some point. It's called 'I Was Married' and I honestly think it will be bigger than 'Me and Mrs. Jones'. But for me, there are still two singles from the \"360 Degrees\" album — 'Brown Baby' and 'I'm Just a Prisoner'. But, we are starting to work on the album more seriously from May 15.\" Despite Paul's enthusiasm, neither \"Brown Baby\" or \"I'm Just a Prisoner\" were released in U.S., although \"Brown Baby\" was issued in the UK but failed to chart.\n\n\"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was such a huge hit that Gamble and Huff decided to re-release Paul's first two albums, \"Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club\" and \"Ebony Woman\". Reissued in 1973, both albums featured new cover art and were a boon to new fans hungry for Billy Paul product who had already purchased his first two PIR LPs. Still, neither reissue was terribly successful, with only \"Ebony Woman\" re-entering the album charts at No. 186 Pop and No. 43 Soul.\n\nPaul's next album, \"War of the Gods\", was the follow-up to \"360 Degrees of Billy Paul\" and was issued in November 1973. Unique in Paul's catalog, it contains lengthy psychedelic soul, song suites and marked a conceptual and musical advance for Paul that did not go unrecognized by critics and fans. And while the LP and its singles enjoyed some success, Paul was unable to repeat the kind of wide impact he had with his previous album and \"Mrs. Jones\". The \"War of the Gods\" single \"Thanks for Saving My Life\", backed with \"I Was Married\" as the B-side, was a top-40 hit, reaching No. 37 on the pop chart and a top-10 soul record, reaching No. 9. It also reached No. 33 in the UK.\n\nPaul's 1973 European tour with the O'Jays and the Intruders spawned his first true live album: \"Live in Europe\". Recorded in London and released in 1974, it reached No. 10 on the \"Billboard\" Soul Album chart and No. 187 on the pop chart.\n\n\"Got My Head on Straight\" was released in 1975 and was an attempt to return to the successful formula of \"360 Degrees of Billy Paul\". A collection of jazzy, soulful, funky, pop songs, it reached No. 140 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Album chart and No. 20 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Be Truthful to Me\" (No. 37 R&B); \"Billy's Back Home\" (No. 52 R&B); and \"July, July, July, July\", which did not chart. Despite the attempted return to form, the lack of mainstream success was a major disappointment to Paul, Gamble and Huff, and everyone at PIR.\n\n\"When Love is New\" followed in the same vein as its predecessor and had a similar fate. Released in December 1975, it reached No. 139 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Album chart and No. 17 on the Soul chart. It included the singles \"Let's Make a Baby\", which hit No. 83 on the Pop singles chart (the last record of Paul's to make that chart), No. 18 on the Soul chart and No. 30 in the UK, and \"People Power\", which reached No. 82 on the Soul chart and No. 14 on the U.S. Dance chart.\n\n\"Let's Make a Baby\" proved controversial and there were calls to ban or alter the track because of its supposed obscene or negative message. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led the movement against this song and others such as Hall & Oates's \"Rich Girl\" and the Four Tops' \"Catfish\". The campaign was waged locally, with individual stations making their own choices about how to handle the matter. For example, leading R&B station WWRL in New York City played \"Let's Make a Baby\" but decided not to announce its title. Other stations went so far as to alter the lyrics. Privately, several black disc jockeys described the controversy as \"Jessie's phony crusade against sex on the air.\" The disc jockeys – who refused to allow their names to be used for fear of reprisals – accused Jackson of being \"absolutely dishonest\" about the campaign, with one popular radio personality making reference to Richard Pryor's 1975 appearance at one of Jackson's events:\n\nThe disc jockeys further pointed out that Jackson was not critical of other artists, such as Roberta Flack and the Brothers Johnson, who had similarly suggestive songs like \"Jesse\" and \"Get the Funk Out of My Face\" but who were supporters of Operation PUSH. Several radio veterans were convinced that Jackson's actions were little more than a publicity stunt, calling it \"just another of his gimmicks, which he will soon drop for another, just to stay in the news.\"\n\nFor his part, Jackson responded: \n\nSurprisingly, the controversy only escalated with the release of Paul's next album, \"Let 'Em In\" in late 1976. The title track was a funky soul version of Paul McCartney's No. 3 U.S. hit from earlier that summer. While McCartney's version was heavy on personal references and comparatively light on political figures, Billy Paul's version turned the formula on its head to become a kind of civil rights anthem – albeit one with a personal touch due to the mention of his recently deceased twin sister Pauline Williams. As where McCartney only obliquely refers to \"Brother John\" (John Lennon or brother-in-law John Eastman or John F. Kennedy) and \"Martin Luther\" (the martyred civil rights leader or the 16th-century theologian), Billy Paul's version is far more explicit in reciting a list of deceased civil rights leaders (Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Medgar Evers, and Louis Armstrong). Furthermore, interspersed with Billy Paul's verses are memorable passages of speeches by Malcolm X and King.\n\nYet, just as they had done with \"Let's Make a Baby\", WVON – Chicago's oldest black-oriented radio station – altered the song. This time an engineer at the station spliced in a parts of a speech by Jesse Jackson as a substitute for parts of King's speech. \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Gary Deeb said the station \"mutilated\" the song, doing so in order to solidify ties with Jackson, and called the whole episode \"simply ridiculous\". Paul was furious and said that he had the \"shock of my life\" when he learned of the alteration.\n\nReverend George Clements, the crusading pastor of Holy Angels Catholic Church on the South Side of Chicago, presented Paul with an award for the song on Billy Paul Day, May 23, 1977, that included a ceremony at the church with the church's school choir performing the song. When informed of the honor by Father Clements, Paul reportedly cried tears of joy. Clements said: \nIn all, \"Let 'Em In\" was Paul's first LP to crack the top 100 pop album chart since 1972's \"360 Degrees of Billy Paul\", reaching No. 88. Paul also had his usual success on the Soul charts, with the album hitting No. 27 and the singles \"How Good is Your Game,\" \"I Trust You,\" and \"Let 'Em In\" reaching Nos. 50, 79, and 91 respectively. Paul's version of the Elton John hit \"Your Song\" cracked the top 40 in the U.K., reaching No. 38.\n\nPaul released \"Only the Strong Survive\" in 1977 and it proved to be his final charting album, reaching No. 152 on the Pop chart and No. 36 Soul. The LP's title track was the first single, reaching No. 68 on the Soul chart and No. 33 in the UK. The next time Paul's voice would be heard during the summer of 1977 was on the track \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", featuring the \"Philadelphia International All-Stars\": Billy Paul, Lou Rawls, Archie Bell, Teddy Pendergrass, Dee Dee Sharp Gamble, and Eddie Levert and Walter Williams of The O'Jays. The song reached No. 91 on the Pop chart and No. 4 on the Soul chart. The \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\" album also included the Billy Paul tracks (both written by Gamble & Huff) \"New Day\" and \"New World Comin'\". All proceeds from the album and single went toward a program to benefit inner-cities throughout the U.S. Paul followed up the success of both his \"Only the Strong Survive\" single and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\" with \"Sooner or Later\" – another track from his latest LP. Yet the track failed to chart as did \"Don't Give Up on Us\" and \"Everybody's Breaking Up\", which was officially released in the U.K. but only issued to radio in the U.S.\n\nPaul's final studio album for Philadelphia International was \"First Class\", released in 1979. It was the first album since his 1968 debut \"Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club\" that did not make either the Pop or Soul charts. The LP's first single \"Bring the Family Back\" failed to chart but a 12\" disco version did reach No. 90 on the Soul chart and No. 51 on the Dance chart. \"False Faces\" was also released in both single and 12\" disco versions but neither charted.\n\nPaul's run at Philadelphia International officially ended with the 1980 release \"Best of Billy Paul\". This double-album compilation included four previously unreleased tracks: \"You're My Sweetness,\" \"Next to Nature,\" \"What Are We Going to Do Now That He's Back,\" and \"My Old Flame.\" The UK version was a single LP titled \"Billy Paul's Greatest Hits\" with a different track listing and only one of the \"new\" songs: \"You're My Sweetness\". That song was released as a single and reached No. 69 on the Soul chart. Paul's final single for Philadelphia International was an edited version of a song from his first Philadelphia International album \"Going East\": \"Jesus Boy (You Only Look Like a Man)\", which failed to chart.\n\nNumerous \"best of\" compilations of Paul's Philadelphia International work have been released over the years, though critics have made plain that most have failed to capture the right balance of singles and album tracks to fully represent the depth and breadth of his PIR output. For example, AllMusic's Andrew Hamilton said of the 2002 collection \"Super Hits\": \"If you didn't live and die with Billy Paul's albums when he cranked them out on Philadelphia International Records, you won't have a clue as to what his fans want to hear. To compile a CD from Paul's singles is to compile a mediocre collection; you have to supplement the singles with choice LP cuts. And with a brief ten-track collection like this, some of the singles should have been replaced with a few of Paul's icy album joints.\" By contrast, Jason Ankeny said that the 1999 compilation \"Me & Mrs. Jones: Best of Billy Paul\" \"goes far beyond the classic title track in restoring the singer to prominence, showcasing his versatility via superb covers of pop favorites... [and] the inclusion of R&B chart hits... it all adds up to a definitive portrait of Paul in his prime.\"\n\nPaul was on the Philadelphia International label, in all, for nine years and while he enjoyed considerable success – especially with \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" – critics generally agree that he deserved better. Andrew Hamilton put it bluntly: \"Gamble and Huff did a horrible job picking Paul's singles. Some better choices, and his career might have been Hall-of-Famish.\" Similarly, Jason Ankeny wrote: \"Too easily dismissed as little more than a one-hit wonder, Billy Paul was, in fact, one of the most gifted and affecting talents to grace the Philadelphia International stable – the recipient of some of the Gamble and Huff team's most lush and sophisticated productions. His deeply soulful voice bridged the gap between jazz and soul, textured in equal measure by street-smart swagger and touching vulnerability.\"\n\nPaul made two studio albums in the 1980s. The first, \"Lately\", was released in 1985 and was a dramatic musical departure from the lush Philadelphia Soul of his previous efforts. Recorded for Lonnie Simmons' Total Experience Records, the album's synthesizer and keyboard-driven tracks (typical of music production at the time) were closer to Simmons' work with the Gap Band and Yarbrough and Peoples than they were to Paul's '70s orchestrated wall of sound. The album's title track, a ballad, was released as a single in the U.K. but did not chart. The follow-up single – a slow jam called \"Sexual Therapy\" – fared better, climbing to No. 80 on the U.K. charts.\n\nPaul's final studio album was 1988's \"Wide Open\" for the Ichiban label. Similar in production style to his previous release, though perhaps a bit smoother, it reached No. 61 on the Soul chart. However, the singles \"We Could Have Been\" and \"I Just Love You So Much\" failed to chart.\n\nPaul announced his retirement in 1989 on stage in London. But like so many artists before him, he could not resist the temptation to continue to play live shows and record. In 2009 he was asked how he was enjoying his retirement in South Jersey: \"Retired? Are you serious?\"\n\nPost-\"retirement,\" Paul regularly toured in the U.S. and abroad playing small clubs, hotel ballrooms, Las Vegas showrooms, Jazz festivals, and theaters. Asked in 2012 whether playing in Philadelphia held special meaning to him, he said: \"I try to feel comfortable wherever I play, but they call it being a native son and I do get a lot of respect there so it is special. The reaction internationally is great as well, so even in Paris or Brazil we have great audiences. Songs like Mrs. Jones are huge everywhere so I do perform a lot overseas.\"\n\nIn 2000 he released a CD – \"Live World Tour 1999–2000\" – on his own label, \"PhillySounds\". Recorded in São Paulo, Brazil; Paris, France; Bermuda, and Philadelphia, it contained the following tracks: \"Billy's Back Home,\" \"Love Buddies,\" \"When Love is New,\" \"This is Your Life,\" \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"Let's Get It On/What's Going On,\" \"War of the Gods,\" \"I Believe I Can Fly,\" \"Your Song,\" \"Without You,\" and \"Mr & Mrs. Jones.\" Two years later, a complete show from that tour was released outside the U.S. on the PID label. Titled \"Your Songs: Live in Paris\", it was recorded in December 2000 at a private event for the RFM TV Channel at Studio 287 in Paris, France. It includes the songs \"July, July, July, July\", \"Only the Strong Survive\", \"It's Too Late\", \"Brown Baby\", \"Let 'Em In\", \"It's Critical\", \"False Faces\", and \"Let's Clean Up the Ghetto\", among others.\n\nAs these live albums illustrate, Paul's concert set lists were varied, containing both his own songs as well as cover versions of jazz, soul, rock, and pop tunes. For example, his September 16, 2001, Sunday afternoon show at Gloria's Seafood in Philadelphia featured \"Billy Boy,\" \"Billy's Back Home,\" \"Just in Time,\" \"Old Folks,\" \"Sleeping Bee,\" \"Ebony Woman,\" \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"Love Buddies,\" \"April in Paris/I Love Paris,\" and \"Me and Mrs. Jones.\"\n\nHis show of June 12, 2011, in São Paulo, Brazil consisted of \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" \"I Will Survive\" (performed by backing vocalist Anna Jordan), \"Hello,\" \"Purple Rain,\" \"Smile,\" \"Mrs. Robinson,\" \"Your Song,\" \"Me and Mrs. Jones,\" and \"You Are So Beautiful.\"\n\nIn 2000, Nike began airing a commercial featuring track and field star Marion Jones – the face of Team USA for the 2000 Summer Olympics. The campaign, entitled \"Mrs. Jones\", depicted the athlete as a half-hidden DJ talking about issues such as education and better pay for female athletes. The ad also featured Paul's studio recording of \"Me and Mrs. Jones\". Paul saw the commercial and contacted an attorney, who filed suit in a federal district court in Los Angeles against both the sportswear company and its advertising agency, Wieden & Kennedy. Paul sought $1 million in lost licensing fees, arguing that the company had not obtained his permission to use the song. A spokesperson for the ad agency called the decision to air the song without permission \"a very stupid mistake.\"\n\nOn the heels of the Nike suit, Paul targeted his former record company for unpaid royalties on his signature song. He claimed that he had not received an accounting statement from Philadelphia International Records in 27 years and sued Assorted Music, its owners Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, and Sony Music Entertainment for nearly half a million dollars. At the 2003 trial in a federal district court in Los Angeles, Joseph E. Porter, the attorney for Assorted Music, argued that Paul was only owed about $27,000, explaining that while the company had mistakenly failed to collect proper foreign royalties on the record, Paul actually owed the company about $314,000 for the costs of recording and producing the 10 albums he made for Philadelphia International from 1971 to 1980.\n\nIn the end, the jury deliberated for less than an hour and found that Paul did not owe the company anything. Instead, they awarded him half a million dollars in unpaid royalties for his recording of \"Me and Mrs. Jones.\" Paul said through a statement issued by his attorney: \"I'm so glad my path to justice has finally come to an end. I've been waiting years to be paid for my recordings.\" Seymour Straus, who testified at trial on Paul's behalf commented: \"There is no question that Billy Paul's royalties had been improperly calculated for many years.\" Jay Berger of the Artists Rights Enforcement Corporation said: \"This case firmly establishes the rights of singers signed to small production companies to receive 50% of the money earned by the major labels that distribute the records.\" Chuck Rubin the president of Artists Rights said: \"The producers will no longer walk off with any of the artist's royalties.\" Paul's lawyer Steven Ames Brown commented: \"It was a stunning victory for Billy. The jury awarded him $12,000 more than we requested. The years of deception and excuses are over and Billy Paul will from now on enjoy the fruits of his talents. Los Angeles juries have no patience for deadbeat record companies.\" Brown added: \"And Billy Paul was Kenny Gamble's best friend. Can you imagine what might have happened to the others?\"\n\nPaul's wife and manager Blanche Williams called the decision a \"moral victory\" and had especially harsh words for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff: \"The jury was...pissed off at the arrogance of G&H, the 'creative bookkeeping' done by Sony, and at discovering how blatantly and systematically Sony and PIR under-reported Billy's earnings... In addition G&H will have to pay us interest on that money going back to '94 (statute of limitations). Oh yes, 'the chickens came home to roost.' Winning this case opens the door for all of those other artists whose royalties were withheld or under-accounted to go to court and seek justice, and to know that they have a good chance of winning their case. This is just the beginning of G&H's worst nightmare. The avalanche cometh.\"\n\nGamble & Huff's attorney Porter said after the verdict: \"It was nothing but an accounting (issue). No one said 'you cheated me.'\" Still, Paul's case was an important precedent for other artists including Archie Bell of Archie Bell & the Drells and the O'Jays who also sued Gamble & Huff for unpaid royalties.\n\nIn 2009, the biographical feature film \"Am I Black Enough for You?\", directed by Swedish director Göran Hugo Olsson, was released. Awarding the film three stars, \"Uncut\" magazine said \"Olsson modelled his film on \"Let’s Get Lost\", Bruce Weber’s 1989 portrait of Chet Baker, saying: \"Paul is certainly no fallen demi-genius to set alongside Baker, but he proves an engaging, articulate subject, with a story that stretches back to playing alongside Charlie Parker, and peppered with the usual racial prejudice. His career is, in its way, emblematic of black America’s struggles over the last half century, including a descent into cocaine addiction and recovery, both shared with his wife, who remains a quirky, willful presence throughout the movie. The pair come across as a jazzy Derby and Joan.\"\n\nPaul explained why he had agreed to work with the filmmakers: \"Well I'm not getting any younger and I wanted to express some things that might have been hidden. I wanted to release my heart and tell people about my highs and lows and I think you get that from this documentary... It wasn't difficult to make. We were followed all over the world by this film crew from Europe and I got to be very good friends with the filmmakers. I would say things and do things as if the camera wasn't even there. They approached me about doing this film, and they are real fans. \"Am I Black Enough for You?\" is very popular in Sweden and these guys really knew their music. They were serious about it, they flew over and followed me and it got real personal...and I trusted them. It's very important like the relationship I have with my wife is based on trust. I wish everyone could have that level in their lives... I am now at peace with myself, I think this movie has done a lot for me because it's helped me get rid of a lot of demons.\n\nIn 2011, Paul participated in an album by French singer Chimène Badi, recording a duet with her on the Motown song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\".\n\nTo mark the 40th anniversary of Philadelphia International Records, in 2011 Big Break Records in the UK began remastering and reissuing many of the albums released on PIR, including Paul's works. They included new liner notes, interviews, and bonus tracks. In the U.S., Legacy Recordings issued \"Golden Gate Groove: The Sound of Philadelphia Live in San Francisco 1973\" – a record company event recorded on June 27, 1973, at the Fairmont Hotel. Paul and other PIR acts were backed by MFSB which featured 35 musicians including Leon Huff on organ. Paul's performances of \"East\" (10:21) and \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" (8:34) appear on the album. AllMusic's Andy Kellman gave the release 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn addition to receiving the Grammy for \"Me and Mrs. Jones\", Paul won several Ebby awards given by the readers of \"Ebony\" magazine; was a recipient of an American Music Award, the NAACP Image Award and numerous proclamations and keys to cities across the United States. Paul received the 2015 AMG Favorite Retro Artist of the Year award, as well as being given the Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award during the Artists Music Guild's 2015 AMG Heritage Awards broadcast held on November 14, 2015, in Monroe, North Carolina.\n\nPaul died on the afternoon of April 24, 2016, at his home in the Blackwood section of Gloucester Township, New Jersey, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 81.\n\n\n\n"}

He abandoned these studies to dedicate himself to literature and leftist politics, and was jailed many times for his revolutionary activities during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. In 1927, Arderíus founded the very successful periodical \"Oriente\". He also edited, together with Antonio Espina and José Díaz Fernández, the political periodical \"Nueva España\" from 1930 to 1931, with an initial print run of 40,000 copies. In 1929, he became affiliated with the Communist Party of Spain, but after 1933, he became aligned with the Republican Left.\n\nHis novels include: \"Mis mendigos\" (1915); the Nietzschean \"Así me fecundó Zaratustra\" (1923); the erotic \"Yo y tres mujeres\" (\"I and Three Women\") (1924); \"La duquesa de Nit\" (1926); \"La espuela\" (1927); \"Los príncipes iguales\" (1928); \"Justo\" (1929), a satire on Roman Catholicism; \"El comedor de la pensión Venecia\" (1930); the political \"Campesinos\" (1931), and \"Crimen\" (1934).

Arderíus went into exile in 1939, first to France and then Mexico, after Adolf Hitler's occupation of Paris. He worked for the embassy of the Spanish Republic there, and later in the Mexican Ministry of National Education. During his exile, he abandoned the writing of novels, and instead wrote a biography of Don Juan de Austria.\n\nThough they were considered too difficult to be commercially successful, Arderíus’ novels are currently being reexamined for their influence on other anti-Franco modernists and post-modernist novelists.\n\n"}

It has a population of 1233 (2005).\n\nAccording to the local tourist information officer, this is the site referred to in what may be the first written mention of present-day Slovak territory.\n\nThis version of events states that in 172 AD Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius had fought a victorious battle in Hronský Beňadik when it started 'raining fire'. The panic this created in his forces led some of the closet Christians among them to start praying, after which the deluge abated and Marcus Aurelius cut short his campaign. The incident was later recorded in the emperor's own memoirs.\n\nIt is situated in the Hron valley between the mountains Pohronský Inovec and Štiavnické vrchy, located around 40 km east of Nitra and 120 km north-east of Bratislava.\n\nThe territory of the village has been settled since the Neolithic and Hallstatt period, but it is best known for a very important Benedictine abbey, which played in important role in the Christianization process and in the development of culture and education. It was founded in 1075 by King Géza I under the name \"Monasterium Ecclesia Sancti Benedicti\". The Nitra Gospels, the oldest Latin book (i.e. not just text) from the territory of Slovakia, were written here around 1100. The abbey ceased operations during the 16th century in the course of the Ottoman expansion in present-day Hungary. The church of the monastery contains valuable works of art (a wood-carving of the Holy Sepulchre, a wall-painting presenting the legend of St. George, an altar depicting the Passion, a sculpture of Jesus Christ from the 13th century, a Madonna sculpture from the 14th century, etc.). The abbey was declared a National Cultural Monument in 1945.\n\nThe village below the abbey arose in the 14th century and received a city charter (town privileges) in 1347, but was destroyed by the Turks (Ottomans) in 1599 and later re-built.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the village had 1,220 inhabitants. 98.44% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.41% Roma, 0.33% Hungarians and 0.25% Czechs. The religious make-up was 91.89% Roman Catholics, 3.28% people with no religious affiliation and 0.90% Lutherans.\n\nBoth members of the Slovak pop duo TWiiNS were born on 15 May 1986 in\nHronský Beňadik.\n\n"}

It lies on the border between the Department of Hautes-Pyrénées (\"Nauts Pirenèus\" / \"Hauts Pirenèus\"), in Occitanie and Gascony, France and Sobrarbe, in Huesca, Aragon, Spain, and the peak is split between the two countries.\n\nThe Vignemale is the name given to the mountain massif in French, which also straddles into Spain. It consists of several distinct summits, the predominant ones being Grand Vignemale or Pique-Longue (in French) / Pica Longa (in Occitan and Catalan) / Punda de Comabichosa (in Aragonese) (3298 m), Pointe Chausenque / Punta Chausenca (3,204 m) and Petit Vignemale / Petita Vinhamala (3,032 m).

{"id": "2080044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080044", "title": "Al-Harith ibn Jabalah", "text": "Al-Harith ibn Jabalah\n\nAl-Ḥārith ibn Jabalah (; [Flavios] Arethas () in Greek sources; Khālid ibn Jabalah () in later Islamic sources), was a king of the Ghassanids, pre-Islamic Arabs who lived on the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire. The fifth Ghassanid ruler of that name, he reigned from to 569 and played a major role in the Roman–Persian Wars and the affairs of the Syriac Orthodox Church. For his services to Byzantium, he was made \"patrikios\" and \"vir gloriosissimus\".\n\nHarith was the son of Jabalah IV (Gabalas in Greek sources) and brother of Abu Karib (Abocharabus), phylarch of Palaestina Salutaris. He became ruler of the Ghassanids and phylarch of Arabia Petraea and Palaestina Secunda probably in 528, following the death of his father in the Battle of Thannuris. Soon after () he was raised by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), in the words of the historian Procopius, \"to the dignity of king\", becoming the overall commander of all the Empire's Arab allies in the East with the title (\"patrician and phylarch of the Saracens\"). His actual area of control, however, may initially have been limited to the northeastern part of Byzantium's Arab frontier. At the time, the Byzantines and their Arab allies were engaged in the Iberian War against the Sasanian Empire and their Arab clients, the Lakhmids, and Justinian's move was designed to create a counterpart to the powerful Lakhmid ruler, Mundhir, who controlled the Arab tribes allied to the Persians.\n\nIn this capacity, Harith fought on behalf of the Byzantines in all their numerous wars against Persia. Already in 528 he was one of the commanders sent in a punitive expedition against Mundhir. In 529, he helped suppress the wide-scale Samaritan revolt, capturing 20,000 boys and girls whom he sold as slaves. It was perhaps Harith's successful participation in this conflict that led Justinian to promote him to supreme phylarch. It is possible that he took part with his men in the Byzantine victory in the Battle of Dara in 530, although no source explicitly mentions him. In 531, he led a 5000-strong Arab contingent in the Battle of Callinicum. Procopius, a source hostile to the Ghassanid ruler, states that the Arabs, stationed on the Byzantine right, betrayed the Byzantines and fled, costing them the battle. John Malalas, however, whose record is generally more reliable, reports that while some Arabs indeed fled, Harith stood firm. The charge of treason leveled by Procopius against Harith seems to be further undermined by the fact that, unlike Belisarius, he was retained in command and was active in operations around Martyropolis later in the year.\n\nIn 537/538 or 539, he clashed with Mundhir of the Lakhmids over grazing rights on the lands south of Palmyra, near the old \"Strata Diocletiana\". According to later accounts by al-Tabari, the Ghassanid ruler invaded Mundhir's territory and carried off rich booty. The Sasanian emperor, Khosrow I (r. 531–579), used this dispute as a pretext for restarting hostilities with the Byzantines, and renewed war broke out in 540. In the campaign of 541, Harith and his men, accompanied by 1200 Byzantines under generals John the Glutton and Trajan, were sent by Belisarius into a raid into Assyria. The expedition was successful, penetrated far into enemy territory and gathered much plunder. At some point, however, the Byzantine contingent was sent back, and subsequently Harith failed to either meet up with or inform Belisarius of his whereabouts. According to Procopius's account, this, in addition to the outbreak of a disease among the army, forced Belisarius to withdraw. Procopius further alleges that this was done deliberately so that the Arabs would not have to share their plunder. In his \"Secret History\", however, Procopius gives a different account of Belisarius's inaction, completely unrelated to the Ghassanid ruler. In , Harith was involved in armed conflict with another Arab phylarch, al-Aswad, known in Greek as Asouades.\n\nFrom on, while the two great empires were at peace in Mesopotamia after the truce of 545, the conflict between their Arab allies continued. In a sudden raid, Mundhir captured one of Harith's sons and had him sacrificed. Soon after, however, the Lakhmids suffered a heavy defeat in a pitched battle between the two Arab armies. The conflict continued, with Mundhir staging repeated raids into Syria. In one of these raids, in June 554, Harith met him in the decisive battle of Yawm Halima (the \"Day of Halima\"), celebrated in pre-Islamic Arab poetry, near Chalcis, at which the Lakhmids were defeated. Mundhir fell in the field, but Harith also lost his eldest son Jabalah.\n\nIn November 563, Harith visited Emperor Justinian in Constantinople, to discuss his succession and the raids against his domains by the Lakhmid ruler Amr ibn Hind, who was eventually bought off with subsidies. He certainly left a vivid impression in the imperial capital, not least by his physical presence: John of Ephesus records that years later, the Emperor Justin II (r. 565–578), who had descended into madness, was frightened and went to hide himself when he was told \"Arethas is coming for you\".\n\nWhen al-Harith died in 569 during a supposed earthquake, he was succeeded by his son al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith ( \"Flávios Alamúndaros\" in Byzantine sources). Taking advantage of this, the new Lakhmid ruler Qabus ibn al-Mundhir launched an attack, but was decisively defeated.\n\nIn contrast to his Byzantine overlords, Harith was a staunch Miaphysite and rejected the Council of Chalcedon. Throughout his rule, al-Harith supported the anti-Chalcedonian tendencies in the region of Syria, presiding over church councils and engaging in theology, contributing actively to the Monophysite church's revival during the sixth century. Thus in 542, following two decades of persecutions which had decapitated the Monophysite leadership, he appealed for the appointment of new Monophysite bishops in Syria to the Empress Theodora, whose own Monophysite leanings were well-known.

OAPEC's primary objective is safeguarding the cooperation of numerous members in various aspects of economic activity within the oil industry as well as maintaining strong relations among themselves; to provide legitimate means to preserve the members' individual and collective efforts within the industry; unite on-going efforts for the procurement of oil; provide access to consumer markets on fair and reasonable terms; and provide conditions, adequate capital, and experience of investors in the oil industry.\n\nOAPEC was originally intended to be a conservative Arab political organization which, by restricting membership to countries whose main export was oil, would exclude governments seen as radical — such as those of Egypt and Algeria. This organizational exclusivity was bolstered by an additional rule in the organization's charter requiring the three founders' approval of all new members. The original aim was to control the economic weapon of potential oil embargo and prevent its use caused by popular emotion. Iraq initially declined to join, preferring to work under the umbrella of the Arab League, considering OAPEC too conservative. Equally the three founders considered Iraq too radical to be desirable as a member. However, by early 1972, the criterion for admission had changed to oil being a significant source of revenue (rather than the principal source) of a prospective member nation; and Algeria, Iraq, Syria and Egypt had been admitted. Consequently, OAPEC became a much more activist organization, contrary to the original intention.\n\nIn 1979 Egypt was expelled from OAPEC for signing the Camp David Accords, although it was readmitted a decade later. \n\nIn 1982 the Arab League's Arab Petroleum Congress (founded in 1959) merged into OAPEC's Arab Energy Conference (founded in 1979), which has continued to meet periodically through at least 2014.\n\nOAPEC is regarded as a regional, specialized international organization focusing on organizing cooperation in oil development, collective projects, and regional integration.\n\n The Judicial Tribunal mitigates disputes between member states; interpretations of the OAPEC Agreement; disputes with a petroleum company operating in its member states' territory, and anything else that falls into OAPEC's jurisdiction or that the Council of Ministers submits to the tribunal. The Judicial Tribunal must unevenly consist of at least seven and no more than eleven judges from Arab countries. The tribunal's judgments are final and binding, and will be enforceable within the territories of residing members.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2080059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080059", "title": "Noor Hossain", "text": "Noor Hossain\n\nNoor Hossain () (Anglicised: Nur Hossain, 1961 – November 10, 1987) was a Bangladeshi activist who was killed by the Bangladesh Police on November 10, 1987, while protesting against President Hussain Muhammad Ershad near Zero Point in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Zero Point was later renamed Noor Hossain Square and the anniversary of his death is officially commemorated each year as Shohid Noor Hossain Day. He is one of the most widely known martyrs from Bangladesh's pro-democracy movement.\n\nHossain's ancestral home on his father's side was in the village of Jhatibunia, which is located in Mathbaria Upazila, Pirojpur District. His father was an autorickshaw operator. His family moved to 79/1 Banagram Road, Dhaka after the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Noor Hossain attended Radhasundari Primary School, which was also on Banagram Road. When he was in 8th grade at Graduate High School, Dhaka, Hossain quit school because of poverty. He was admitted to a motor driving school and received training in driving like his father. Interested in politics, Hossain became the publicity secretary of the Banagram unit committee of Dhaka City Joubo League. He was neither well-off nor highly educated but he embodied the struggle of common people of the country, and has become a public symbol.\n\nOn November 10, 1987, political opponents came together for what they called a \"Dhaka Siege\" (Dhaka Blockade) to demand an end to the rule of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad based on violations of democracy. Although he had been in power since 1982 through a coup d'état, he won the October 1987 election but opponents charged it was a fraud. The Awami League and Bangladesh National Party united in opposition against Ershad's rule. One opposition demand was an election of the National Assembly under a non-partisan caretaker government. The rally turned violent and several leaders and protester Noor Hossain were killed under riot conditions, as well as several hundred injured at the time. Noor Hossain was among three Jubo League members killed at a protest rally. The other two were leaders Nurul Huda Babul and Aminul Huda Tito. In the aftermath, the opposition called for a nationwide protest strike on November 11 and 12.\nHossain is now associated in Bangladesh with anti-autocracy and pro-democracy. At the time he was shot, his body carried several slogans in white paint. He wore the slogan \"Down with autocracy\" \"(Sairachar nipat jak)\" on his chest, and on his back, he had written the slogan \"Let Democracy Be Free\" \"(Ganatantra mukti pak)\". His death raised the visibility of opposition sentiment directed against the Ershad government.\nErshad was removed from office December 6, 1990 as a result of the mass movement that grew from the Dhaka Siege. After Ershad was out of office, Khaleda Zia of the BNP was elected as Bangladesh's first female Prime Minister and a year later the government established a national date to commemorate the event. It was first called \"Historic November 10 observance\" but the Awami League supported the phrase \"Noor Hossain Day\", by which it is known today. Ershad's Jatiya Party became part of the Awami League coalition after his removal, and later Ershad apologized for Hossain's death. The Jatiya Party does commemorate the day but refers to it as \"Democracy Day\" (Bengali: Ganatantra Dibash).\nNoor Hossain and the square remained significant for protesters after Hossian's death in 1987 and Ershad's removal in 1990. In 1993, the Awami League led protesters to the square on the occasion of the November 10 anniversary against the BNP government, which also provoked a reaction from the police.\nIn 1996, Ershad officially apologized for Hossain's death before parliament and also to Hossain's father. Ershad maintained his apology but also criticized the opposition in using Hossain as a symbol against his government. In 2012, he said, \"You (opposition) came up with dead bodies as they were needed to spark demonstration.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina has given her own account of Hossain's death: \"I remember what happened on that day. Noor Hossain was standing beside me when we took out our procession. I called him and told him they would kill him for what he had inscribed on his chest. Then he brought his head near the window of my car and said, 'Sister, you just bless me. I will sacrifice my life to free democracy.\"\n\nHasina also said, \"\"Bangladesh got back the rights to vote and food in exchange of Shaheed Nur Hossain’s supreme sacrifice.\"\"\n\nMarium Bibi, Hossain's mother, has most recently said, \"\"I still don’t see anything for which my son died.\"\" In an earlier interview, she said, \"\"It is hard for any mother to lose her son. But I have no sorrows... I am proud of Noor.\"\"\n\nThe event of his death is honored each year as cultural and political organizations sponsor special programs for observance the day. The day is officially commemorated as Shohid Noor Hossain Day in Bangladesh.\n\nPhotographs of Noor Hossain wearing slogans on his chest taken by Dinu Alam and back taken by Pavel Rahaman were taken shortly before his death and become an important visual icon in Bangladesh representing the struggle for democracy.\n\nA postage stamp was issued by Bangladesh in honor of his martyrdom.\n\nHossain is the subject of the Bengali film \"Buk tar Bangladesher hridoy\".\n\nA fictional character named \"Nur Hossain\" appears in Neamat Imam's novel \"The Black Coat\"\n"}

{"id": "2080079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080079", "title": "KOIN (TV)", "text": "KOIN (TV)\n\nKOIN, virtual channel 6 (UHF digital channel 25), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Portland, Oregon, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Salem-licensed CW affiliate KRCW-TV (channel 32). The two stations share studios in the basement of the KOIN Center skyscraper on Southwest Columbia Street in downtown Portland and transmitter facilities in the Sylvan-Highlands neighborhood of the city.\n\nKOIN's history traces back to a radio station at 970 AM that launched on November 9, 1925 as KQP; the station changed its call sign to KOIN on April 12, 1926. It became an affiliate of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), now known as the CBS Radio Network, on September 1, 1929. During the golden years of radio, KOIN was one of Portland's major radio stations, with an extensive array of local programming, including live music from its own studio orchestra.\n\nAs a CBS radio affiliate, KOIN was the local home for CBS radio programs such as the \"CBS World News Roundup\", \"Lux Radio Theater\" and \"Suspense\". An FM station, KOIN-FM (at 101.1 Mc.), was launched in 1948. Both stations were owned by Field Enterprises, Inc. from 1947 until sold in 1952 to the Mount Hood Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nRadio stations KOIN and KOIN-FM were sold on May 1, 1977 to the Gaylord Broadcasting Company, and effective May 12, 1977 their call signs changed to KYTE & KYTE-FM, respectively. Its affiliation with CBS ended, and the CBS Radio Network's programming in the Portland market moved to KYXI at that time. The stations using the former KOIN frequencies currently are KUFO (AM) and KXL-FM.\n\nKOIN-TV began broadcasting on October 15, 1953, as Portland's first VHF television station. It took on an affiliation with the CBS Television Network, to match the radio station (channel 6 has always been a primary CBS station, and as such, it is the only Portland TV station to never change its primary affiliation). At the time, it was jointly owned by Mount Hood Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation; Newhouse Broadcasting Corporation (now Advance Publications), owner and publisher of \"The (Portland) Oregonian\"; local investors and Marshall Field's department stores. The station took its calls from KOIN radio (AM 970 and 101.1 FM), which was a joint venture of Mount Hood Broadcasting and Newhouse. Eventually, Marshall Field sold its stake to Newhouse. Lee Enterprises purchased KOIN-TV in April 1977 from the Mount Hood-Newhouse group. KOIN's first color television broadcast was made on August 14, 1954, only three days after then-NBC-affiliate KPTV (channel 12) had made Portland's first such broadcast.\n\nOn February 27, 1971, both transmitter towers used by KOIN-FM and KOIN-TV—the main tower and the auxiliary tower—collapsed during an ice and wind storm. The two KOIN (AM) towers, located on the same property, were not damaged. Nine days later, on March 9, 1971, KOIN-FM and KOIN-TV returned to the air when a temporary tower was erected on the site of the collapsed auxiliary tower. During those nine days off the air, CBS programming was provided to the Portland market (and, by extension, most of Oregon) by independent station KVDO-TV in Salem (Oregon Public Broadcasting later purchased KVDO and moved the station to Bend as KOAB-TV). In 1978, a production company, MIRA Mobile Television, was founded.\n\nDuring the 1970s, KOIN still had a handful of locally produced programs on the air, including \"RFD 6\", \"Hi! Neighbor\", the cooking show \"KOIN Kitchen\", and public affairs programs such as \"News Conference Six\" and \"Northwest Illustrated\". In 1976, KOIN-TV became the second television station in the Portland market (after KPTV) to broadcast Portland Trail Blazers basketball games. Selected Blazers games aired on KOIN-TV until 1996, when the Blazers moved to KGW. KOIN was the first flagship station of the Trail Blazers' radio network, beginning in the inaugural 1970-71 season, and ending when the station was sold shortly before the Trail Blazers won the 1976–77 NBA championship, which was broadcast on KOIN-TV via CBS' coverage (KOIN also broadcast all Blazers games that were aired through CBS Sports from 1973 to 1990).\n\nBy the 1980s, one of KOIN's past general managers—Richard M. \"Mick\" Schafbuch—served one term in 1981 as President of the CBS Network Affiliates Group. In 1982, C. Stephen Currie, KOIN's program operations manager, was elected to serve as the president of the National Association of Television Program Executives. During KOIN-TV's 30th anniversary week in 1983, the station aired classic CBS programming from the 1950s and 1960s. By this time, the station had moved into its new location at KOIN Center. In 1984, the station aired the Japanese program \"From Oregon With Love\". The \"-TV\" suffix was dropped on August 31, 1992, fifteen years after KOIN radio was sold off.\n\nIn October 2000, the Lee Enterprises television group, including KOIN was purchased by Emmis Communications. On January 27, 2006, Emmis sold KOIN (along with KHON-TV in Honolulu, Hawaii, KSNT in Topeka, Kansas and KSNW in Wichita, Kansas) to Montecito Broadcast Group for $259 million.\nDue to a dispute over fees, Comcast did not offer KOIN's high definition feed for over two years after it started offering other Portland area stations in HD. After Montecito took ownership, Comcast started carrying KOIN in high definition on February 28, 2006. KOIN was also in a dispute with DirecTV over transmission of its HD feed, as both sides claimed the other to be the problem. In August 2008, KOIN's HD feed began to be carried on DirecTV.\n\nKOIN updated its website in September 2006 as part of a partnership with WorldNow. KOIN expected the switch to lead to over $1 million in revenue during its first year; it was characterized by KOIN general sales manager Bob Singer as a \"creative new way\" to boost revenue for a station with a \"somewhat average ratings position.\"\n\nOn July 24, 2007, Montecito announced the sale of all of its stations (KOIN, plus KHON-TV and its satellites, KSNW and its satellites, and KSNT) to New Vision Television. The sale closed on November 1, 2007. In March 2008, KOIN relaunched its website through Newport Television subsidiary Inergize Digital, replacing the old WorldNow-powered site. The websites of several of its sister stations in other markets also switched to the Inergize platform in late December 2008 and early January 2009. In October 2008, KOIN converted its central Oregon translators into a locally focused semi-satellite, KBNZ, which was sold off in 2010.\n\nOn December 30, 2008, one of the 15 guy wires on the main transmitter tower snapped, putting the tower in danger of collapsing (as with the 1971 tower collapse, this incident followed a prolonged snow and ice storm). The Portland Police Bureau evacuated about 500 local residents and closed several roads around the tower, including a portion of Skyline Boulevard, the main north-south road through the West Hills of Portland. At first, officials feared that the wire itself—which is over long and weighs several tons—had snapped, which would have taken several weeks to manufacture and install a replacement. Upon inspection, it was revealed that one of the high frequency insulators incorporated into the guy wire assembly had shattered. Repair crews replaced the insulator by 4:00 p.m. the next day and the surrounding neighborhood was reopened to residents and car traffic. KOIN had to pay $1,500 to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nOn May 7, 2012, LIN Media announced that it would acquire KOIN and the other New Vision stations for $330.4 million and the assumption of $12 million in debt. The FCC approved the sale on October 2, and it was completed ten days later on October 12, 2012. The group deal reunited KOIN, KHON, KSNW and KSNT with several former Emmis-owned stations which had been purchased by LIN seven years earlier, such as KRQE in Albuquerque, New Mexico, WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama and WLUK-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin (KOIN, KRQE, KSNW, and KSNT had also been sister stations under Lee Enterprises).\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would purchase LIN Media and its stations, including KOIN, in a $1.6 billion merger. The merger was completed on December 19. Less than a year later, on September 8, 2015, Media General announced that it would acquire the Meredith Corporation for $2.4 billion, with the combined group to be renamed Meredith Media General once the sale is finalized by June 2016. Because Meredith already owns Fox affiliate KPTV (channel 12), and the two stations rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Portland market in total day viewership, the companies would have been required to sell either KPTV or KOIN to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as recent changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations that restrict sharing agreements; KPTV's MyNetworkTV-affiliated sister station KPDX (channel 49) could have remained with either KPTV or KOIN or be spun off to the suitor as its total day viewership ranks below the top-four ratings threshold.\n\nHowever, the proposed deal with Meredith would later fall through, and on January 27, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. KOIN became part of \"Nexstar Media Group\" and is the company's first station in Oregon.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media—which has owned CW affiliate KRCW-TV (channel 32) since 2003—for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar included the overlap between KOIN and KRCW-TV among the television stations in thirteen markets where the group may consider making divestitures to address national ownership cap issues related to the Tribune transaction and/or to comply with FCC local ownership rules preventing it from owning two or more stations in the same market. However, KRCW does not rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Portland market in total day viewership, and FCC regulations no longer preclude legal duopolies that would leave fewer than eight independently owned television stations in a single market (a KOIN/KRCW combination would leave only seven full-power commercial television stations with independent ownership remaining in the market, barring a second legal duopoly in the market under the previous \"eight-voices test\" rules repealed by the FCC in November 2017), hence there are no legal hurdles in place which would otherwise preclude a KOIN/KRCW duopoly. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nOn January 11, 2016, KOIN activated digital subchannel 6.2, which carried a standard definition version of KOIN and CBS programming for the next twenty days. At 12:05 a.m. PST on February 1, 2016, subchannel 6.2 began carrying GetTV programming.\n\nOn March 10, 2016, KOIN activated digital subchannel 6.3 and began carrying Decades programming until it was replaced with Bounce TV in September 2019.\n\nKOIN shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6.\n\nAs part of the SAFER Act, KOIN kept its analog signal (also heard at 87.7 FM like other channel 6 analog stations throughout the country) on the air from 7:28 a.m. on June 12 until June 27 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements in English and Spanish from the National Association of Broadcasters. On June 27, 2009, at 7:06 a.m., KOIN broke from the nightlight PSA loop to air the station's 25th-anniversary special (originally broadcast in 1978) for the station's final 24 minutes of analog broadcasting; the analog signal permanently shut down at 7:30 that morning. As a result of the digital transition, those in the market lost access to KOIN's audio feed that was transmitted over the 87.7 FM frequency.\n\nKOIN's syndicated offerings include \"The Doctors\", \"Dr. Phil\", \"Extra\", and \"Entertainment Tonight\".\n\nKOIN presently broadcasts 35½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). On February 1, 2007, KOIN became the first television station in the Portland market to being broadcasting its local newscasts in widescreen standard definition. According to Oregon Media Insiders, during Montecito's ownership of KOIN, its local news ratings declined in all time periods; among the four news-producing stations in the Portland market, KOIN had the greatest loss in audience share.\n\nFor the first time in ten years, KOIN finished in first position in the 11 p.m. news in the May 2008 NSI sweeps. \"KOIN News 6 at 11\"—unlike a year earlier when it lost over 20 percent of its CBS lead-in share—held its prime time share throughout its 11 p.m. newscast in the May 2008 NSI sweeps. In January 2008, KOIN's then-owners, New Vision Television, fired news director Jeff Alan and replaced him with Lynn Heider. Afterwards, KOIN dropped its slogan \"Bringing News Home\" as Jeff Alan had trademarked it under his name in 2000 before he worked at KOIN.\n\nUnder new news director Heider and long-time creative services director Rodger O'Connor, KOIN's 11 p.m. newscast increased its household ratings from May 2007 to May 2008 by 12 percent and its household share by 19 percent. It increased its household ratings by 30% from February 2008 to May 2008 and its household share by 33%. According to general manager Christopher Sehring, \"The defining moment for KOIN News came in the third week of the sweeps. Up until then, we were having a strong ratings run against some terrific competition. Unfortunately, we then lost two straight nights – and I was worried that these losses might shake our new-found confidence. Fortunately, our team roared back on Thursday night, delivering an 8 household rating by increasing \"Without A Trace\"’s 19 share lead-in to a 21 share. This type of comeback is indeed the sign of a station that refuses to toss in the towel – and will go a long way to helping us continue New Vision's plan to reenergize this great operation.\" This was the first time in a decade that KOIN's newscasts has won any timeslots.\n\nOn September 9, 2009, KOIN launched a new local program airing weekdays at 4 p.m., called \"Keep It Local\". The show explored local neighborhoods and highlighted events taking place in Portland. The program was hosted by Priya David, with Mike Donahue and Araksya Karapetyan serving as its reporters. In 2010, \"Keep It Local\" was reformatted into \"Studio 6\", a product and lifestyles magazine, hosted by Jenny Hansson, Anne Jeager, Hayley Platt and Jake Byron.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, KOIN became the third television station in the Portland market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. It is also the first in the market to broadcast all aspects of its news programming, including field reporting, studio and weather segments completely in the format. Two other stations, KGW and KATU, broadcast studio segments within their newscasts in high definition but continue to present live field stories in widescreen standard definition. KPTV was the only station remaining in the market that broadcast its local newscasts in widescreen standard definition until it upgraded to HD on August 26, 2013.\n\n\n\nKOIN is rebroadcast on the following network of translator stations.\n\nLow-power translators in Cascadia, Florence, Heppner, Monument, Seaside, Sisters, Wallowa, and Trout Lake, Washington have been discontinued.\n\n"}

They were unable to complete the voyage due to visa problems at the border of China and returned to England by sea from Bombay.\n\nFrom conquistadors to nineteenth-century gentlemen explorers, Severin follows the routes and tells the stories of the adventurers who have travelled along the US river the Mississippi for hundreds of years, and does so while navigating the length of the river by canoe and launch.\n\nIt is theorized by some scholars, that the Latin texts of \"Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis\" (The Voyage of St Brendan the Abbot) dating back to at least 800 AD tell the story of Brendan's (c. 489–583) seven-year voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to a new land and his return. Convinced that the legend was based in historical truth, in 1976 Severin built a replica of Brendan's currach. Handcrafted using traditional tools, the 36-foot (11 m), two masted boat was built of Irish ash and oak, hand-lashed together with nearly two miles (3 km) of leather thong, wrapped with 49 traditionally tanned ox hides, and sealed with wool grease.\n\nBetween May 1976 and June 1977, Severin and his crew sailed the \"Brendan\" 4,500 miles (7,200 km) from Ireland to Peckford Island, Newfoundland, stopping at the Hebrides, the Faroe Islands and Iceland en route. He considered that his recreation of the voyage helped to identify the bases for many of the legendary elements of the story: the \"Island of Sheep\", the \"Paradise of Birds\", \"Crystal Towers\", \"mountains that hurled rocks at voyagers\", and the \"Promised Land\". Severin's account of the expedition, \"The Brendan Voyage\", became an international best seller, translated into 16 languages.\n\nThe boat is now featured at the Craggaunowen open-air museum in County Clare, Ireland.\n\nThe famous adventures of the medieval sailor Sindbad, as recorded in \"One Thousand and One Nights\", became the inspiration for Severin's next voyage. After three years of researching the legend and early Arab and Persian sketches of medieval ships, he brought the project to Sur, Oman in 1980. Sponsored by Qaboos bin Said al Said, Sultan of Oman, he guided Omani shipwrights in the construction of the \"Sohar\", an 87-foot (26.5 m) replica of a ninth-century, lateen-rigged, cotton-sailed Arab dhow. The ship was constructed in seven months of hand-sawn wooden planks sewn together with nearly 400 miles (640 km) of hand-rolled, coconut-husk rope.\n\n\"Sohar\" left Oman on 21 November 1980. Navigating by the stars, Severin and his crew of 25 travelled nearly 6,000 miles (9,600 km) in eight months. From Sur they sailed east across the Arabian Sea, south down India's Malabar Coast to Lakshadweep and on to Calicut, India. The next phase of their voyage took them down the coast of India to Sri Lanka. They were becalmed in the doldrums for nearly a month, suffered broken spars, and were nearly run down by freighters, but arrived in Guangzhou, China on 6 July.\n\nThe epic poem \"Argonautica\", first written down by Apollonius of Rhodes in Alexandria in the late 3rd century BC, became the basis for Severin's next expedition. He began his research into ancient Greek ships and the details of the text in 1981. Master shipwright Vasilis Delimitros of Spetses hand built a 54-foot (16.5 m) replica of a Bronze Age galley based on a scale model of the \"Argo\". In 1984, with twenty volunteer oarsmen, Severin rowed and sailed from northern Greece through the Dardanelles, crossed the Marmara Sea, and passed through the Straits of Bosphorus to the Black Sea, reaching the Phasis delta in then-Soviet Georgia: a voyage of 1,500 miles (2,400 km). Along the way they identified some of the landmarks visited by Jason and his Argonauts, and found a possible explanation for the legend of the Golden Fleece. Severin recounted the expedition in \"The Jason Voyage\" (1985).\n\nOnce again making use of the \"Argo\" from \"The Jason Voyage\", in 1985 Severin followed the route of Ulysses' voyage home in \"The Odyssey\", from Troy to Ithaca in the Ionian islands. Along the way, Severin made tentative or conclusive identifications of The land of the Lotus-eaters, King Nestor's palace, the Halls of Hades, the Roving Rocks, Scylla and Charybdis, and also the sirens. \"The Ulysses Voyage\", published in 1987, tells the story of the expedition, the historical research that went into it, and the discoveries Severin and his crew made along the way.\n\nNine hundred years after the First Crusade, Tim Severin and Sarah Dorman set out on horseback to follow the 2500 mile route of Duke Godfrey of Boullion and other Crusaders from Belgium to Jerusalem, travelling through the modern lands of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia (itself today consigned to history), Bulgaria, Turkey and Syria. The horses chosen were a riding school palfrey (Mystery) and a Heavy Ardennes (Carty), the latter a descendant of the war horses of Crusader cavalry – what Severin called ‘the Main Battle Tank’ of its day. This journey, after many years of marine expeditions was a return to long distance land exploration by Severin. The Journey would take place over 2 years with the horses and riders resting over the winter of 1987/8. Severin was unable to follow exactly the route of Duke Godfrey due to the civil war in the Lebanon, instead routing through Syria and Jordan to reach Jerusalem.\n\nWhile still a student at the University of Oxford, Severin wrote his thesis on the first European travellers in Central Asia during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. With this background, to commemorate the 800th birthday of Genghis Khan he rode with Mongol herdsmen along the route once used by couriers of the Mongolian empire, mingled with camel herders in the Gobi Desert, and ate with Kazakhs in their yurts. His story, part travelogue, part research paper, was published in 1993 under the title \"In Search of Genghis Khan\".\n\nAncient Chinese texts tell the story of Hsu Fu, a navigator and explorer sent by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, in 218 BC into the \"Eastern Ocean\" in search of life-prolonging drugs. Hsu Fu completed the voyage on a bamboo raft, which some believe took him to America and back.\n\nSeverin set out to prove that such a voyage could have been made. On the beach at Sam Son, Vietnam, he oversaw the construction of a 60-foot (18.3 m) long, 15-foot (4.6 m) wide raft built of 220 bamboos and rattan cording, and driven by an 800 square foot (74 square metre), junk-rigged sail. After leaving Asia in May 1993, Severin and his crew faced monsoons, pirates and typhoons before the rattan began rotting and the raft began falling apart in the mid-Pacific. After travelling 5,500 miles (8,850 km) in 105 days, they were forced to abandon the raft about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) short of their destination.\n\nAlthough the \"Hsu Fu\", as the craft was named, did not complete the trip, Severin believed the voyage had accomplished its purpose. In \"The China Voyage\", published in 1994, he wrote that the expedition had proved that a bamboo raft of the second century BC could have made a voyage across the Pacific, just as Hsu Fu's account recorded.\n\nFollowing the path of the \"Pequod\", Severin sets out to find a living, white sperm whale. His quest takes him to the remotest parts of the South Pacific: the Philippine island of Pamilacan, whose people hunt whale sharks with their hands and grappling hooks and the Indonesian island of Lamalera, whose people hunt sperm whales with harpoons from open boats. Throughout his expedition, Severin is able to compare Melville's account with the reality he discovers, and to show that much of Melville's material was either borrowed or fabricated.\n\nSeverin has also written historical fiction. The \"Viking Series\", first published in 2005, concerns a young Viking adventurer who travels the world. In 2007 he published \"The Adventures of Hector Lynch\" series set in the late 17th century about a 17-year-old Corsair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On the surface it looks fine. It plays decently and if you know how to use IsoMotion2, you can definitely enjoy playing offense. There's a lot of fine-tuning needed and it seems pretty clear this game really shouldn't be shipping quite so soon. I just couldn't possibly play any more of the Association. It's not bad, it just isn't great and some of the AI gaffs began to really get on my nerves over time. However, the 24/7 mode is refreshing, even after playing a lot last year. Considering this is a $20 game, it's certainly worth it to pick up just for those nice extra modes. However, if you want to play a real NBA sim, this one may disappoint you. It's too drive-minded and while it tries to create the idea of individuals and personality with the visuals and Association, the gameplay seems to ignore who these players are on the court. I want this to be a great game. I know a lot of other people do as well. But it just isn't great. It's merely good. And in the competitive world of sports sims these days, being good isn't enough.\"\n\nBy July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of \"ESPN NBA 2K5\" had sold 1 million copies and earned $20 million in the United States. \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 57th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. Combined console sales of \"ESPN NBA 2K5\" reached 1.6 million units in the United States by July 2006.\n"}

OAR is also referred to as NOAA Research.\n\nNOAA Research is the research and development arm of NOAA and is the driving force behind NOAA environmental products and services aimed at protecting life and property and promoting sustainable economic growth. Research, conducted by programs within NOAA and through collaborations outside NOAA, focuses on enhancing the understanding of environmental phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, climate variability, changes in the ozone layer, El Niño/La Niña events, fisheries productivity, ocean currents, deep sea thermal vents, and coastal ecosystem health.\n\nThe origins of NOAA Research date back more than 200 years with the creation of the Survey of the Coast in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson. The Coast Survey, which became the U.S. Lake Survey office in 1841, was developed to undertake \"a hydrographic survey of northwestern [Great] lakes.\" Research executed by the scientists of this group was innovative and holistic: the first current meters were developed to understand water flow rates, and forecasting techniques were greatly enhanced to predict water levels and the relationship to lakefront property. The same traits of world class, long-term research continue to define NOAA Research today.\n\nThe science and technology that NOAA Research produces is not only relevant to society, it anticipates and responds to partners’ needs to demonstrates the value of technologies so that partners can deploy them into their applications. OAR works with end-users to integrate mature technologies (and associated expertise) into larger systems, either in NOAA operations or partner applications, via testbeds, patents, etc.\n\nNOAA Research is an open research network consisting of seven federal research laboratories, six program offices, sixteen Cooperative Institutes (which are non-federal, non-profit research institutions in 5-10 year collaborative partnerships with NOAA), and 33 university based Sea Grant programs. OAR also relies on work performed at numerous public, private, and academic institutions. Through its laboratories, programs, and external partners, OAR seeks to balance the activities that benefit from the long-term, dedicated capabilities of federal facilities with those that require the diverse expertise of our university partners.\n\nThe components and programs of NOAA Research are:\n\nOWAQ includes the Earth Prediction Innovation Center, \ncreated by Congress in 2018 to improve collaboration with academia and private companies.\n\nNOAA Research has three primary research areas: Climate; Weather and Air Chemistry; and Oceans, Coasts, and the Great Lakes. Both in-house and external scientists: \nResearch plans and products are developed in partnership with academia and other federal agencies, and are peer-reviewed and widely distributed. A high premium is placed on external collaboration both domestically and internationally.\n\nNOAA's research laboratories, the Climate Program Office, and research partners conduct research into complex climate systems and how they work. The aim of this research is to predict climate variation in the shorter term, for example, cold spells or periods of drought, and over longer terms, such as centuries and beyond.\n\nNOAA scientists are at the forefront of studying climate change and modeling what the effects will be on the Earth. Researchers at NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have developed the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) to enable a valid assessment of the impact of how climate change might affect the climate and ecology of the Great Lakes. The CHARM model provides a realistic surface-atmosphere feedback portrayal, and accounts for runoff from land surfaces. It allows researchers to predict that global warming likely will bring higher temperatures and increased precipitation to the Great Lakes. Development of a second generation of CHARM is underway to help answer questions about greenhouse warming effects on Great Lakes water quantity.\n\nNOAA researchers closely monitor the Earth's atmosphere searching for clues about long-term changes in the global climate. The data collected worldwide by NOAA researchers contributes to the understanding of complex climatic systems and the ability to forecast changes.\n\nNOAA Research organizations conduct research on the upper and lower atmosphere as well as the space environment. Their findings form the basis for NOAA's contributions to major national and international environmental programs and agreements.\n\nFor instance, improvements in forecast and warning services provided by the National Weather Service are a direct result of NOAA research. Improvements in numerical modeling, observations gathered by satellites and Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD), and sophisticated weather warning and information processing and communications systems, have collectively led to significantly improved severe weather forecasts and warnings.\n\nOther research programs focus on observation and study of the chemical and physical processes of the atmosphere, detecting the effects of pollution on those processes and monitoring and forecasting the phenomena affecting the Sun-Earth environment.\n\nNOAA Research, in cooperation with its research partners, explores and investigates ocean habitats and resources. The findings of NOAA researchers contribute to the management of fisheries, conservation of coastlines, and development of a stronger economy through marine products and businesses, such as biotechnology and sustainable aquaculture.\n\nNOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle, Washington, designed Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART-II) technology, which provides two-way communication capabilities, allowing engineers the ability to troubleshoot these systems from the lab and repair them remotely when possible. This capability minimizes system downtime, especially in the harsh winter conditions of the North Pacific, and reduces costs by not having to deploy a ship to make repairs.\n\nNOAA research is intended to:\n\nThe 7 laboratories that are part of NOAA Research are located throughout the United States near their areas of focus.\n\n\nThe NOAA Research Laboratories conduct an integrated program of research, technology development, and services to improve the understanding of Earth's atmosphere, oceans and inland waters, and to describe and predict changes occurring to them. The laboratories and their field stations are located across the country and around the world.\n\nThe laboratories have established formal collaborative agreements with universities/non-profit research institutions to form joint research institutes that are centers of scientific excellence pertaining to the earth's oceans, inland waters, intermountain west, atmosphere, and arctic environment.\n\nScientific reviews are conducted every five years to evaluate the quality, relevance, and performance of research conducted at the OAR laboratories. These reviews help to strategically position laboratories in their planning of future science and are intended to ensure that OAR laboratory research is linked to the NOAA Next Generation Strategic Plan, remains relevant to the NOAA research mission and its priorities, and is consistent with NOAA planning, programming, and budgeting processes.\n\nNOAA Research partners with research-oriented universities and institutions to share data and resources to advance the goals of NOAA.\n\n\n"}

These scratches and gouges were first recognized as the result of a moving glacier in the late 18th century when Swiss alpinists first associated them with moving glaciers. They also noted that if they were visible today that the glaciers must also be receding.\n\nGlacial striations are usually multiple, straight, and parallel, representing the movement of the glacier using rock fragments and sand grains, embedded in the base of the glacier, as cutting tools. Large amounts of coarse gravel and boulders carried along underneath the glacier provide the abrasive power to cut trough-like \"glacial grooves\". Finer sediments also in the base of the moving glacier further scour and polish the bedrock surface, forming a \"glacial pavement\". Ice itself is not a hard enough material to change the shape of rock but because the ice has rock embedded in the basal surface it can effectively abrade the bedrock.\n\nMost glacial striations were exposed by the retreat of glaciers since the Last Glacial Maximum or the more recent Little Ice Age. As well as indicating the direction of flow of the glacial ice, the depth and extent of weathering of the striations may be used to estimate the duration of post-glacier exposure of the rock.\n\nAn outstanding example of glacial grooves can be found at the Glacial Grooves at Kelleys Island, Ohio (a National Natural Landmark), the most impressive of which is long, wide, and up to deep. These grooves cut into the Columbus Limestone. Striations cover the sides and bottoms of the grooves.\n\nOther examples of glacial striations can be found in the former path of the Moiry Glacier, south of Grimentz, Anniviers, Valais, Switzerland, alongside the present path of the glacier, north-east of the 2016 location of the tongue of the glacier (images).\n\nThe following affect the rate of abrasion:\n\n\n"}

Perez, then Congressman of the Lone District of Nueva Vizcaya which pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, Section 20 (1) of the Philippine Constitution, became a law without the signature of President Carlos P. Garcia, entitled Republic Act No. 2519. Pursuant to Section 1 of this law, the seven barrios composing the Municipality of Saguday are\nas follows: La Paz, Saguday (now Rizal and Magsaysay), Salvacion, Santo Tomas which were separated from the Municipality of Diffun; while Dibul, Mangandingay and Tres Reyes were separated from the\nMunicipality of Aglipay.\n\nOriginally, Saguday was a barrio of the Municipality of Santiago, Isabela, however, upon the final settlement of the boundary dispute between Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya, Saguday became a regular barrio of Diffun by virtue of an Executive Order No. 386, issued by then President Elpidio Quirino.\n\nThe naming of Saguday has no legendary story or folktale. It was named by Mr. Jose Cardenas of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, the grandfather of former Mayor Leandro G. Cardenas who came to visit his kins in Saguday. The word Saguday is an Ilocano term which connotes that one possesses good traits and blessed with clean mind, heart and soul.\n\nThe first settlers of Saguday were spearheaded by the adventurous and hardworking Ilocanos composed of the families of Corpuz, Cortez, Cabiles, Guzman and Bacani who hailed from the Province of Pangasinan, the Pagbilao and Olonan family from Ilocos Region, and the families of Cardenas, and Tomas from the Province of Nueva Ecija, who all came to exploit the vast virgin lands and forest of this very promising valley.\n\nIn August 16, 1959, the founding set of Local Officials to govern the Local Government Unit appointed by then President of the Republic of the Philippines Carlos P. Garcia have assumed office, with then Luis C. Lucas, Sr. as the Municipal Mayor, while the late Nicanor Pagbilao as the Municipal Vice Mayor.\n\nSaguday was born as a sixth class municipality composing of seven (7) barrios, however, in the year 1980 and 1981, two (2) additional barangays were created. Barangay Cardenas was created in 1980\npursuant to Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 02, series of 1980, while Barangay Gamis was founded in 1981, pursuant to Resolution No. 05, Series of 1981. At present, Saguday is still a 5th Class Municipality due to its limited income which is attributed to scarce resources.\n\nUpon the creation of the Municipality of Saguday, the urban core was divided into two barrios : District I now Barangay Magsaysay has been the seat of the Municipal Government from then up to present, and District II now Barangay Rizal.\n\nSaguday will be a prime agro-industrial and residential investment destination in the province nurtured by God-loving, informed, empowered, and healthy citizens who live in a competitive and sustainable economy in a peaceful and pro-active community under a transparent, accountable and ethical governance.\n\nTo promote, uplift and transform the way of life of the people towards a competitive and sustainable economy through a good organizational climate, culture of change, and the delivery of accessible, comprehensive and quality services by means of a transparent, accountable and ethical governance.\n\nSaguday is politically subdivided into 9 barangays.\n\n\n"}

They are 2-4-0WT well tanks, originally built between 1863 and 1875 for use on passenger services in the suburbs of London, but later used on rural services in South West England. Out of a total production of 85, two locomotives have been preserved in an operational condition.\n\nIn 1850, the LSWR decided that the London suburban passenger services should be operated using small tank locomotives. To determine the most suitable type, Joseph Hamilton Beattie, the LSWR Mechanical Engineer, prepared a series of designs for six-wheeled well tank locomotives, each of which incorporated one or more differences from the previous class. A small quantity of each was produced: between 1852 and 1859, 26 were built, to six different designs. These were the \"Tartar\" and \"Sussex\" classes of 1852, the \"Chaplin\" and \"Minerva\" classes of 1856, the \"Nelson\" class of 1858 and the \"Nile\" class of 1859. The wheel arrangement was either 2-2-2WT or 2-4-0WT; the driving wheels varied between and in diameter; the cylinder bore varied between ; the stroke was either ; and there were other changes.\n\nHaving chosen the most suitable characteristics, Beattie prepared a standard design of 2-4-0 well tank with driving wheels and cylinders , bore by stroke; and the LSWR began to take delivery of these in 1863. The new design eventually totalled 85 locomotives; most came from the Manchester firm of Beyer, Peacock and Company between 1863 and 1875, but three were built in the LSWR workshops at Nine Elms during 1872. Their numbers were 33, 34, 36, 44, 76, 177–220, 243–270, 298, 299, 314 and 325–329.\n\nThe locomotives were built as follows:\n\nThe locomotives delivered in February 1863 were the first locomotives on the LSWR not to be given names. Five of the later locomotives were named: 33 \"Phœnix\"; 34 \"Osprey\"; 36 \"Comet\"; 44 \"Pluto\"; 76 \"Firefly\"; these names were generally taken from older locomotives which had carried the same numbers.\n\nIn a well tank locomotive, the water tanks are not mounted above the footplate, but are set low down. On these locomotives, there were two tanks, both between the frames: one was above the leading axle, the other beneath the cab footplate. Although a standard design, there were periodic changes - the cylinder bore was enlarged to from no. 189 and again to for the three Nine Elms engines; and the last twelve, of 1874–75, had cylinders . The three Nine Elms locomotives, and the last six of 1875, exhibited more obvious detail differences compared to the other 76: the leading wheels were diameter instead of ; two of the four safety valves were larger; but the most noticeable difference was that the splashers were rectangular instead of round. These resembled side tanks, but carried no water—this feature was introduced by J.H. Beattie's son and successor, William George Beattie, who had taken office on 23 November 1871 after his father's death on 18 October.\n\nThey handled heavy loads with ease, and were fast runners. From 1890, when newer locomotives became available for the London suburban services, the Beattie 2-4-0WTs were sent to depots outside the London area. Some of their new duties required a greater water capacity than the tanks could contain, and so 31 were converted to tender engines between 1883 and 1887; these were withdrawn between 1888 and 1898. Of the remainder, most were withdrawn between 1888 and 1899, but six (nos. 44, 257, 266, 298, 314, 329) were modernised between 1889 and 1894 for use on branch lines such as those to and . Three of these, nos. 44, 257 and 266 (the latter two having by then been renumbered 0257 and 0266), were also withdrawn between 1896 and 1898. The other three locomotives (298, 314 and 329) were transferred to the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway in 1895, which was one of the earliest railways in Cornwall and isolated from the main LSWR network until that year. These three remained in service because of the sharp curves of that railway's freight branch to Wenford Bridge, which carried china clay traffic to the main line. They were finally withdrawn in 1962 and replaced by GWR 1366 Class 0-6-0PT dock tanks. In 1958, they were noted as \"the oldest design still in use on British Railways (although not quite the oldest engines ...)\", the latter distinction being given to nos. 32636 and 32670 of the former LB&SCR A1x class, which had been built in 1872.\n\nWhen the locomotives became old, their numbers were altered in order to release numbers for newer locomotives being built as replacements. The process was known as a transfer to the \"duplicate list\", and the existing number could be altered in any of four ways: addition of zero prefix; being crossed out; being underlined; being given a line or dot beneath the number. These methods were equivalent, and some locos had the numbers altered in one way on the cab side, and in a different way in the record books. Thus, no. 298 became no. 0298.\n\nNot every loco was transferred to the duplicate list - several were withdrawn whilst carrying their original numbers. Most were transferred between 1888 and 1894, but the three retained for the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway were not given duplicate numbers until later on. The renumberings of these final three were as follows:\n\nThe first SR number was simply the final LSWR number prefixed with \"E\", to denote Eastleigh Works.\n\nTwo of the locomotives have survived and are preserved. Number 298 (later renumbered 30587) is owned by the National Railway Museum (NRM) and is loaned to, and normally based at, the Bodmin and Wenford Railway, however it was at the NRM for six months (from July 2018 until January 2019) hauling brake-van rides in the South Yard. Number 314 (30585) is owned by the Quainton Railway Society and normally based at their Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. \n\nIn October 2010, 30585 was on short term loan to the Bodmin and Wenford Railway. Both preserved engines were in steam and operating trains together on parts of the routes they would have served between 1895 and 1962.\n\nDapol manufacture a model of the 0298 in OO gauge for sale by Kernow Model Rail Centre.\n\n\n"}

Jan Wolff and Israel Lyon Chaikoff at the University of California Berkeley, is a presumed reduction in thyroid hormone levels caused by ingestion of a large amount of iodine. In 1948, Wolff and Chaikoff reported that injection of iodine in rats almost completely inhibited organification (thyroglobulin iodination) in the thyroid gland. However, recent research into the study shows that the thyroid hormone levels of the rats were not checked prior to injections. \n\nPatients with Graves' disease are more sensitive than euthyroid patients, and iodine has been used to manage Graves' disease.\n\nThe Wolff–Chaikoff effect is known as an autoregulatory phenomenon that inhibits organification in the thyroid gland, the formation of thyroid hormones inside the thyroid follicle, and the release of thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. This becomes evident secondary to elevated levels of circulating iodide. The Wolff–Chaikoff effect is an effective means of rejecting a large quantity of imbibed iodide, and therefore preventing the thyroid from synthesizing large quantities of thyroid hormone. Excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification. In individuals with a normal thyroid, the gland eventually escapes from this inhibitory effect and iodide organification resumes; however, in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, the suppressive action of high iodide may persist. \nThe Wolff–Chaikoff effect lasts several days (around 10 days), after which it is followed by an \"escape phenomenon,\" which is described by resumption of normal organification of iodine and normal thyroid peroxidase function. \"Escape phenomenon\" is believed to occur because of decreased inorganic iodine concentration inside the thyroid follicle below a critical threshold secondary to down-regulation of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) on the basolateral membrane of the thyroid follicular cell.\n\nThe Wolff–Chaikoff effect has been used as a treatment principle against hyperthyroidism (especially thyroid storm) by infusion of a large amount of iodine to suppress the thyroid gland. Iodide was used to treat hyperthyroidism before antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil and methimazole were developed. Hyperthyroid subjects given iodide may experience a decrease in basal metabolic rate that is comparable to that seen after thyroidectomy. The Wolff–Chaikoff effect also explains the hypothyroidism produced in some patients by several iodine-containing drugs, including amiodarone. The Wolff–Chaikoff effect is also part of the mechanism for the use of potassium iodide in nuclear emergencies.\n\n"}

Also, people who have Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or various types of thyroid adenoma are also at risk of Jod-Basedow effect when receiving iodine, because the thyroid will then not respond to the negative feedback from increased thyroid hormones. The source of iodine may be from the diet, administration of the iodinated contrast for medical imaging, or amiodarone (an antiarrhythmic drug). \n\nThe hyperthyroidism usually develops over 2 to 12 weeks following iodine administration.\n\nIn some ways the Jod-Basedow phenomenon is the opposite of the Wolff–Chaikoff effect, which refers to the short period of thyroid-hormone suppression which happens in normal persons and in persons with thyroid disease, when comparatively large quantities of iodine or iodide are ingested. However, (unlike the Wolff-Chaikoff effect), the Jod-Basedow effect does not occur in persons with normal thyroid glands, as thyroid hormone synthesis and release in normal persons is controlled by pituitary TSH secretion (which does not allow hyperthyroidism when extra iodine is ingested).\n\nIn iodinated contrast administration for medical imaging, monitoring is indicated in people with thyroid disease, such as toxic multinodular goiter, Graves’ disease, or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Otherwise, for the general population, routine screening with thyroid function tests is generally not feasible.\n\nThe Jod-Basedow effect is named for the German word for iodine, \"Jod\" (all nouns are capitalized in German, and German cognates of English nouns with an initial letter \"I\" preceding a vowel are frequently spelled with initial \"J\", pronouned as \"ee\", thus \"Jod\" = \"EE-ode\"), plus the name of Karl Adolph von Basedow, a German physician who first described the effect. The nomenclature \"Jod-Basedow\" was carried over intact from the German, rather than being translated, presumably on the erroneous assumption that \"Jod\" is a surname. Thus, a more informative nomenclature in English, and one that avoids the appearance of an eponym involving a nonexistent \"Dr. Jod\", would be \"the Basedow iodine effect\".\n\nThe Jod-Basedow phenomenon is differentiated from Basedow's disease, which is occasionally used as a synonym for Graves' disease.\n"}

Aldys, who loathes Guy and his gang, invites Josie to join The Denominators, a group of intelligent students.\n\nJosie develops a crush on her English teacher, Sam Coulson, and becomes the top student in his class. After reciting a romantic excerpt from Shakespeare to Sam, Josie has horrible flashbacks to when she read a romantic poem aloud in class to her high school crush, a popular boy named Billy Prince, who later asked her to their senior prom, making her dream come true. However, on the night of the prom, Billy arrives with another girl and both of them hurl eggs and insults at Josie, humiliating her and breaking her heart.\n\nOne night while out driving with Aldys, Josie encounters Guy and his gang at a local hangout called \"The Court\" where promiscuity and underage drinking take place.

He descended from a younger branch of the Árpád dynasty. After spending fifteen years in exile, he ascended the throne during an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians. He strengthened the position of Christianity in the Kingdom of Hungary and successfully defended its independence against the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHis efforts to ensure the succession of his son, Solomon, resulted in the open revolt of his brother, Béla. Béla dethroned Andrew by force in 1060. Andrew suffered severe injuries during the fighting and died before his brother was crowned king.\n\nMedieval sources provide two contradictory reports of the parents of Andrew, and his two brothers, Levente and Béla. For instance, the \"Chronicle of Zagreb\" and \"Saint Gerard's Life\" write that their father was Vazul, a grandson of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians (r. \"c.\" 955–\"c.\" 970). The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" and other medieval sources write of Vazul's relationship with \"some girl\" from the Tátony clan who bore his sons, who thus \"were not born of a true marriage-bed\". According to a concurrent tradition, which has been preserved by most chronicles, the three princes were the sons of Vazul's brother, Ladislas the Bald. Modern historians, who reject the latter report, agree that Andrew and his brothers were the sons of Vazul and his concubine from the Tátony clan. According to the historian Gyula Kristó, Andrew was the second among Vazul's three sons. He writes that Andrew was born around 1015.\n\nAccording to medieval chronicles, Vazul was blinded during the reign of his cousin, King Stephen I, the first Christian monarch of Hungary (r. 997–1038). The king ordered Vazul's mutilation after the death, in 1031, of Emeric, his only son surviving infancy. The contemporary \"Annals of Altaich\" writes that the king himself ordered the mutilation of one of his kinsmen, who had strong claim to the throne, in an attempt to ensure a peaceful succession to his own sister's son, Peter Orseolo. The same source adds that the king expelled his blinded cousin's three sons from Hungary. According to the contrasting report of the Hungarian chronicles, King Stephen wanted to save the young princes' lives from their enemies in the royal court and \"counselled them with all speed\" to depart from Hungary.\n\nExiled from Hungary, Andrew and his brothers settled in the court of Duke Oldřich of Bohemia (r. 1012–1033). Here they came across King Mieszko II of Poland (r. 1025–1031, 1032–1034) who likewise took refuge in Bohemia after his opponents had expelled him from his kingdom. The Polish monarch regained his crown and returned to Poland in 1032. Andrew, Béla and Levente, whose \"condition of life was poor and mean\" in Bohemia, followed Mieszko II who received them \"kindly and honourably\" in Poland. After the youngest among them, Béla, married a daughter of Mieszko II, Andrew and Levente decided to depart from Poland, because they \"felt that they would be living in Poland under their brother's shadow\", according to Simon of Kéza.\n\nHungarian chronicles have preserved a story full of fabulous or anachronistic details of the two brothers' ensuing wanderings. For instance, they narrate that Andrew and Levente were captured by Cumans, but the latter only arrived in Europe in the 1050s. Having faced many hardships, Andrew and Levente established themselves in the court of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev (r. 1019–1054) in the late 1030s. The grand prince gave his daughter, Anastasia in marriage to Andrew. Kristó writes that Andrew, who had up to that time remained pagan, was baptized on this occasion.\n\nIn the meantime, King Peter Orseolo, who had succeeded King Stephen in Hungary in 1038, alienated many lords and prelates from himself, especially when he solemnly recognized the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III in 1045. According to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", the discontented lords, \"seeing the sufferings of their people\", assembled in Csanád (Cenad, Romania). They agreed to send envoys to Andrew and Levente to Kiev in order to persuade them to return to Hungary. Fearing \"some treacherous ambush\", the two brothers only set out after the agents they had sent to Hungary confirmed that the Hungarians were ripe for an uprising against the king.\n\nBy the time the two brothers decided to return, a revolt had broken out in Hungary. It was dominated by pagans who captured many clergymen and mercilessly slaughtered them. Andrew and Levente met the rebels at Abaújvár. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" narrates how the pagans urged the dukes \"to allow the whole people to live according to the rites of the pagans, to kill the bishops and the clergy, to destroy the churches, to throw off the Christian faith and to worship idols\". The same source adds that Andrew and Levente gave in to all their demands, \"for otherwise they would not fight\" for them against King Peter.\n\nThe \"Annals of Altaich\" states that Andrew \"savagely raged against the flock of the Holy Church\". Even so, Bishop Gerard of Csanád and four other prelates were ready to join Andrew, but the pagans captured and slaughtered three of them (including Gerard) at Buda. King Peter decided to flee from Hungary and take refugee in Austria. However, Andrew's envoys tricked the king to return before he reached the frontier, and they captured and blinded him.\n\nMost Hungarian lords and the prelates opposed the restoration of paganism. They preferred the devout Christian Andrew to his pagan brother Levente, even if, at least according to Kristó and Steinhübel, the latter was the eldest among Vazul's three sons. The Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, who died in short time, did not oppose his brother's ascension to the throne. The three bishops who had survived the pagan uprising crowned Andrew in Székesfehérvár in the last quarter of 1046 or in the spring of 1047. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Andrew was crowned with a crown that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos had sent to him. Nine enamelled plaques from this golden crown were unearthed in Nyitraivánka (Ivanka pri Nitre, Slovakia) in the 19th century. Andrew soon broke with his pagan supporters, restored Christianity and declared pagan rites illegal. According to Kosztolnyik, Andrew's epithets (the White or the Catholic) are connected to these events.\n\nThe contemporaneous Hermann of Reichenau narrates that Andrew \"sent frequent envoys with humble entreaties\" to Emperor Henry III, proposing \"an annual tribute and faithful service\" if the emperor recognized his reign. Andrew persuaded his brother, Béla, to return from Poland to Hungary in 1048. He also granted his brother one third of the kingdom with the title of duke. Béla's duchy comprised two regions which were centered on Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) and Bihar (Biharia, Romania).\n\nSkirmishes on the frontier between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire first occurred in 1050. Emperor Henry invaded Hungary in August 1051, but Andrew and Béla successfully applied scorched earth tactics against the imperial troops and forced them to withdraw. Legend says that the Vértes Hills near Székesfehérvár were named after the armours\"vért\" in Hungarianwhich were discarded by the retreating German soldiers.\n\nAndrew initiated new peace negotiations with the emperor and promised to pay an annual tribute, but his offers were refused. Next summer, the emperor returned to Hungary and laid siege to Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia). Zotmund, \"a most skilful swimmer\" scuttled the emperor's ships. After Pope Leo IX mediated a peace treaty, the emperor lifted the siege and withdrew from Hungary. Andrew soon refused to fulfill his promises made under duress, and even allied with Conrad I, Duke of Bavaria, a prominent opponent of Emperor Henry III.\n\nAndrew's queen, Anastasia, gave birth to a son, named Solomon in 1053. Andrew attempted to make his son's succession secure, even against his brother, Béla, who had strong claim to succeed Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority.\n\nThe brothers' relationship did not deteriorate immediately after Solomon's birth. In the deed of the foundation of the Tihany Abbey, a Benedictine monastery established in 1055 by Andrew, Duke Béla was listed among the lords witnessing the act. This charter, although primarily written in Latin, contains the earliest extant text\"Feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea\" (\"on the military road which leads to Fehérvár\")written in Hungarian. Andrew also established a lavra for Orthodox hermits in Tihany and an Orthodox monastery near Visegrád. The \"Third Book of Law\" of King Ladislaus I of Hungary (r. 1077–1095) refers to an \"estate survey of the judge Sarkas\" under \"King Andrew and Duke Béla\". According to György Györffy, the serfs of the royal domains were registered during this survey which took place around 1056.\n\nAndrew suffered a stroke which paralyzed him. In an attempt to strengthen his son's claim to the throne, he had the child Solomon crowned in the one-year-long period beginning in the autumn of 1057. For the same purpose, Andrew also arranged the engagement of his son with Juditha daughter of the late Emperor Henry III, and sister of the new German monarch, Henry IV (r. 1056–1105)in September 1058. Thereafter, according to an episode narrated by most Hungarian chronicles, the king invited Duke Béla to a meeting at Tiszavárkony. At their meeting, Andrew seemingly offered his brother to freely choose between a crown and a sword, which were the symbols of the kingdom and the \"ducatus\", respectively. Duke Béla, who had previously been informed by his partisans in Andrew's court that he would be murdered on the king's order if he opted for the crown, chose the sword.\n\nHowever, Béla, who actually had no intention of renouncing his claim to succeed his brother in favor of his nephew, fled to Poland and sought military assistance from Duke Boleslaus II of Poland (r. 1058–1079). With Duke Boleslaus's support, Béla returned to Hungary at the head of Polish troops. On the other hand, the Dowager Empress Agneswho governed the Holy Roman Empire in the name of her minor son, Henry IVsent Bavarian, Bohemian and Saxon troops to assist Andrew.\n\nThe decisive battle was fought in the regions east of the river Tisza. Andrew suffered injuries and lost the battle. He attempted to flee to the Holy Roman Empire, but his brother's partisans routed his retinue at Moson. The \"Annals of Niederaltaich\" narrates that wagons and horses trampled him in the battlefield. Deadly wounded in the battlefield, Andrew was seized and taken by his brother's partisans to Zirc where \"he was treated with neglect\", according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Andrew died in the royal manor there before his brother was crowned king on 6 December 1060. Andrew was buried in the crypt of the church of the Tihany Abbey.\n\nAndrew's wife, Anastasia, was the daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev by his wife, Ingegerd, who herself was the daughter of King Olof Skötkonung of Sweden. Andrew married Anastasia, who was born in about 1020, around 1038. Their first child, Adelaide was born around 1040. She became the wife of Vratislaus II of Bohemia, who was initially Duke and, from 1085, King of Bohemia. Andrew and Anastasia's first son, Solomon, was born in 1053, their second son, David, some years later. Neither Solomon nor David fathered sons; the male line of Andrew's family died out with their death by the end of the 11th century.\n\nMedieval chronicles write that Andrew had a natural son, named George, \"by a concubine\" from the village of Pilismarót. Since his name was popular among Orthodox believers, Gyula Kristó says that his mother may have been a Russian lady-in-waiting of Andrew's queen. The story that the Clan Drummond in Scotland are descended from George and his son Maurice is not accepted by some scholars.\n\nThe following family tree presents Andrew's ancestry, his offspring, and some of his relatives mentioned in the article.\n\n\"*A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady.\"\"**Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2080194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080194", "title": "Commonwealth Police", "text": "Commonwealth Police\n\nThe Commonwealth Police (COMPOL) was the federal law enforcement agency in Australia between 1917 and 1979. A federal police force was first established in 1917, and operated under different names and in some periods as multiple organisations. In late 1979, the Commonwealth Police and Australian Capital Territory Police were merged to form the Australian Federal Police (AFP).\n\nInitially, after the six British colonies in Australia federated in 1901, there was no police agency to enforce federal (Commonwealth) laws. Instead, the various state police forces were called upon by the Commonwealth as required.\n\nDuring the latter stages of World War I, there was considerable tension within Australian society, particularly over the issue of introducing military conscription. On 29 November 1917, at a public rally over this issue in the rural Queensland township of Warwick, an egg was thrown at Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes. The offender was charged under Queensland state law, whereas Hughes wanted a Commonwealth charge preferred. The incident, and the perceived lack of action on the part of the Queensland Police, was the last straw for Hughes, who had spent months arguing and fighting with the government of Queensland, led by its anti-conscriptionist Premier T. J. Ryan, over a range of issues. Hughes doubted the loyalty of several prominent Queensland politicians and public servants, and felt that it was necessary to create a Commonwealth Police Force to ensure that Commonwealth law was adhered to in what he regarded as a \"rogue\" state.\n\nUnder the \"War Precautions Act, 1914,\" Hughes quickly created a plain-clothed police force, which commenced operations in mid-December 1917. Hughes claimed Australia was at risk from possible revolt or similar action by organisations associated with either Irish nationalism, left wing and anti-war activities, such as \"Sinn Féin\" and the Industrial Workers of the World. At its peak the Commonwealth Police Force numbered about 50 men, almost all of whom were based in Queensland, despite the force notionally being a national one. Commonwealth Police had full police powers for federal offences, but their main task was to report on subversive activities of those opposed to the war and/or the Commonwealth government. Tensions between the Queensland and federal governments flared up a number of times, including during and after a federal police raid on the Queensland Government Printer's Office.\n\nAfter World War I ended, the Government began to wind the force down. In 1919 it was formally disbanded and the few remaining officers at this time were merged with the remnants of the military's Special Intelligence Bureau to form the Investigation Branch, which was later known as the Commonwealth Investigations Branch (CIB). Like the Commonwealth Police Force, the CIB was administered by the Commonwealth's Attorney-General's Department.\n\nCIB had offices located in most of the states' capital cities. The agency, which never had more than about 100 staff, had two roles. The first role was to investigate offences against Commonwealth laws and to better coordinate the investigative capacity of the various Commonwealth Departments. The second role was to conduct special intelligence investigations and mount surveillance on any left-wing groups the Government felt to be subversive of national security.\n\nThe Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police Force from 1917 to 1919 was William Anderson, a former Inspector in the New South Wales Police.\n\nMajor H. E. (Harold) Jones replaced Anderson just before the Commonwealth Police was formally disbanded. Jones became the head of the Special Intelligence Bureau and led the Investigation Branch; among the hallmarks of his time in office was a single-minded focus on suppressing left-wing groups of any sort, ranging from trade unions to the nascent Communist Party of Australia.\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory Police, also known as the Commonwealth Police (and the Australian Capital Territory Police), was also led by Jones from its establishment on 28 September 1927.\n\nDuring World War II the CIB's special intelligence functions were largely handed over to the Commonwealth Security Service (CSS).\n\nWhen Jones retired, in 1943, he is said to have refused to hand over codes given to him by MI5, and sent a secret report on CIB's activities to the head of MI5, Sir David Petrie. In a letter (dated 31 December 1943), Jones told Petrie: \"The Government having decided that my retirement should take place at the end of the present year, I am sending you a brief review of the work of the Security Section, which I have had the especial (sic) honour of controlling, particularly as your representative, for the past 27 years.\"\n\nJones' letter and report (headed \"A brief review of the world of the Security Service of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch\") to Petrie, stated, among other things, that:\n\nJones was succeeded as the head of the federal police organisation by Edwin Longfield-Lloyd.\n\nA Peace Officer Guard (POG) was established in 1925 and by the 1940s consisted of several hundred uniformed officers who primarily provided physical security at critical government locations across the nation. For administrative reasons the head of the Commonwealth Investigation Service (CIS) was automatically Superintending Peace Officer in charge of the POG. Other senior CIS officers also occupied senior POG positions in an ex-officio capacity.\n\nFollowing the war's end the CSS and CIB were consolidated into the Commonwealth Investigation Service [CIS].\n\nIn 1949, the Australian Government, at the insistence of British and US authorities, established the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and transferred the counter-espionage and associated roles from the CIS to ASIO. This left the CIS to focus on the more traditional investigation duties.\n\nRay Whitrod, a former Detective Senior Constable in the South Australia Police and early member of ASIO, succeeded Longfield-Lloyd as head of CIS and the Peace Officer Guard in 1953.\n\nBy the early 1950s the Commonwealth Investigation Service was run-down and largely ineffective: It had lost a lot of its quality staff to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; resources were limited; and its role was in reality poorly defined. The Peace Officer Guard was in a similar position. In 1957 the Commonwealth Government acted to address the situation and passed the \"Commonwealth Police Act\". This led, in 1960, to the formal merger of the CIS and the POG into the Commonwealth Police (unofficially known as COMPOL). Over the course of the next two decades the Commonwealth Police expanded its roles and capabibilities. In addition to increasing the numbers of detectives (to investigate crimes such as money laundering, damage to and theft of Commonwealth property), the Commonwealth Police developed forensic, training and administrative services for the Commonwealth and to assist state police agencies. Commonwealth Police assumed responsibilities for policing Norfolk Island and Christmas Island, established intelligence liaison posts overseas, and conducted uniformed policing duties at the nation's main airports. In 1964, Commonwealth Police (including a number of state police sworn in as special COMPOL members) deployed to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. In addition to providing physical security at many key government locations, the Commonwealth Police also took on a greater role in providing close personal protection to senior politicians and diplomats.\n\nRay Whitrod remained Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police until 1969. After Whitrod left in 1969 to head the Royal Papua & New Guinea Constabulary (as it was then known), Commissioner Jack Davis led the Commonwealth Police.\n\nIn early 1975 the then Labor Government moved to merge the Commonwealth Police with the other federally funded agencies, the Australian Capital Territory Police and Northern Territory Police. The new agency was to be called the Australia Police. Planning was well advanced when the proposal was abandoned in late 1975.\n\nFollowing the 1978 terrorist bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, a review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements strongly urged the creation of a single federal police force. On 29 October 1979, the Commonwealth Police and ACT Police were merged to form the Australian Federal Police (AFP).\n\nOther Australia law agencies:\n\n"}

He grew up in Tamworth, New South Wales and attended Tamworth High School, leaving at the age of 16 to work as a postie while spending most of his time on the golf course. He moved to the United States in 1994, and having initially stayed with family friends, for a time slept in his car parked at the Cog Hill Golf & Country Club near Chicago, Illinois. He won the Illinois State Amateur Championship in 1994 before turning professional the following year. He now lives in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nHensby played on what is now the Korn Ferry Tour (formerly named the web.com Tour, Nationwide Tour, the Buy.com Tour, the Nike Tour, and the Ben Hogan Tour) for several years from 1997 before he graduated to the PGA Tour for the 2001 season. He gained his place on the elite tour by virtue of his 2nd-place finish on the Buy.com Tour money list in 2000. In his rookie season, Hensby did not earn enough money to retain his card and was forced to return to the second tier for 2002, after failing to regain his place at the end of season qualifying school. In 2003, he picked up his third win on the Nationwide Tour and finished 7th on the money list, to graduate directly to the PGA Tour for the second time.\n\n2004 was a breakthrough season for Hensby as he sought to establish himself on the PGA Tour. He collected his first win at the 2004 John Deere Classic, where he defeated John E. Morgan in a sudden-death playoff, and also had several other top 10 finishes on his way to 15th place on the end of season money list. The following season, he made an impact in the majors, finishing tied for 5th at the Masters, tied for 3rd in the U.S. Open, and tied for 15th in the British Open. In 2005, Hensby made the cut in all four majors and was awarded with a spot in the 2005 Presidents Cup.\n\nA car accident early in 2006 severely limited Hensby's ability to compete that year, but he came back in 2007 to finish just outside the top 100 on the PGA Tour money list and secure his card for following season. His struggles were not over however and in 2008, he slipped outside the top 150 to lose his fully exempt status.\n\nHensby won the Scandinavian Masters on the European Tour in 2005. He was as high as 27th in the Official World Golf Ranking in 2005.\n\nA series of injuries and three shoulder surgeries, plus two failed attempts at European Tour Q School, halted Hensby's career. He made his first PGA Tour start in two years (and first cut on any major tour since 2011) at the 2015 Barbasol Championship. He was the co-leader at the 36-hole point with rookie Kim Meen-whee. Hensby finished T6, his first PGA Tour top ten finish in seven years.\n\nIn December 2017, the PGA Tour suspended Hensby for one year retroactive to 26 October for violating the Tour's anti-doping policy.

He starred in his own Channel 4 television show \"Sean's Show\" and was one of the regular team captains on the BBC Two musical panel game \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\".\n\nHughes was born in Archway, London, but spent most of his youth in Firhouse, Dublin. His mother, who was from Cork met his father, who was from Dublin, on a London bus. His mother intended to train as a nurse but the plan never materialised. His father worked in a telephone exchange and was also a driving instructor. At the age of six, Hughes moved to Dublin and lived with his paternal grandmother. He attended Coláiste Éanna in Ballyroan.\n\nWriting in \"The Guardian\", Bruce Dessau noted of Hughes's early years that:\n\n[He] used to talk about how sounding like a Cockney in an Irish school was not easy. He later quipped that he spent \"most of my childhood in a headlock\". Not surprisingly his Mary Poppins accent soon developed a lilting local burr. Making schoolfriends laugh was a classic defence mechanism and he even set up comedy gigs at his school. What started out as a hobby quickly became a career.\n\nIn 1987 he began appearing at the Comedy Store. In 1990, aged 24, he became the youngest winner of the prestigious Perrier Comedy Award for his show, \"A One-Night Stand with Sean Hughes\".\n\nHe marked his 30th birthday with the \"Sean Hughes Is Thirty Somehow\" tour, which was broadcast on Channel 4, in 1995. Hughes returned to stand-up, touring the UK and Australia in 2007 with his show, \"The Right Side of Wrong\".\n\nAs well as comedy, he wrote collections of prose and poetry and worked on a number of films. He also presented weekend radio shows on the BBC's London radio station BBC GLR, and in 2002 joined BBC 6 Music, presenting the Sunday morning programme. He left the station a year after its launch, proclaiming it had turned into everything he had wanted it to be. He also wrote two novels, \"The Detainees\" (1998) and \"It's What He Would Have Wanted\" (2000).\n\nIt was reported that Hughes was a close friend of the late American comedian Bill Hicks, but Hughes stated this was not true. In a 2014 interview, he explained, \"It says on my Wikipedia page that I was good friends with him. I wasn't! We were in Australia together, so we hung out. I did get to know him a little bit, which was a real pleasure. When I saw him I just went, 'That's the best comic I'm going to see in my lifetime.'\" \n\nNevertheless, Hughes wrote the foreword to Cynthia True's biography of Hicks, \"American Scream. The Bill Hicks Story\". He concluded his foreword by writing \"being a genius is a heavy burden and he's the only one I'm ever likely to meet. I still miss you Bill.\"\n\nHughes had a small role in the film \"The Commitments\" (1991), playing a record producer. \n\nIn 1992, he had his own TV show, \"Sean's Show\", ostensibly set in his own home. It received a nomination for the 1992 British Comedy Award for Best Channel 4 Sitcom. Series one of \"Sean's Show\" has been released on DVD. Later, he recorded a series of brief programmes called \"Sean's Shorts\", in which he toured England, visiting many of the country's towns and cities, visiting local places of interest and meeting local people. He appeared in the film \"Snakes and Ladders\" shot in Dublin, and released in 1996.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2002, he was a team captain on the BBC 2 comedy quiz show \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", alongside Phill Jupitus and Mark Lamarr. He can be seen during Terrorvision's music video for their single \"Tequila\" from 1999 and in the video for The Cure's 1996 single, \"The 13th\". He appeared in the 2010 Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nIn ITV's series \"The Last Detective\", featuring \"Dangerous\" Davies, Hughes played his friend, the perpetually unemployed and well-read \"Mod Lewis\" (he spends all his time at the library to save on heating). He played Eileen Grimshaw's love interest Pat in the British soap \"Coronation Street\".\n\nIn 2003, Hughes voiced the part of Finbar the clockwork Shark, one of seven plastic bath toys which come to life whenever no-one is watching in the children's television series \"Rubbadubbers\", shown on CBeebies in the United Kingdom for pre-school children.\n\nHe played Sergeant Lake in the ITV Agatha Christie's Marple production of \"They Do It with Mirrors\", which was broadcast on 1 January 2010.\n\nHughes played Brendan in the film version of Tony Hawks' book, \"Round Ireland with a Fridge\" (2010). He also played the lead in the film adaptation of Spike Milligan's comic novel, \"Puckoon\". Hughes also voiced Tapir in the three \"Robbie the Reindeer\" films. \n\nHe appeared in \"Casualty\" in 2015.\n\nIn early 2014 Hughes started a podcast called \"Under The Radar\", running for approx 57 episodes (excluding repeats and split episodes) until December 2016\n\nHughes took over the role of Stationmaster Mr Perks in the musical \"The Railway Children\" at King's Cross Theatre in March 2015.\n\nHughes died at the age of 51 on 16 October 2017 from the effects of cirrhosis, at Whittington Hospital in North London (the same hospital in which he was born in 1965). \n\nA funeral service was held at St Pancras and Islington Cemetery on 23 October 2017, where, after the mourning party heard eulogies to his memory, listened to recited extracts of some of Hughes' poetry and recorded music from The Smiths, his body was cremated. A wake was held afterwards in a pub in the vicinity.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2080213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080213", "title": "Avezzano", "text": "Avezzano\n\nAvezzano ( ; ) is a city and \"comune\" with a population of about 42,500 inhabitants, situated in the Abruzzo region, province of L'Aquila, Italy. It is the second most populous municipality in the province and the sixth in the region. Avezzano was documented as an existing urban center in the ninth century. The city was destroyed by the earthquake of 1915. It was rebuilt after the 1944 Allied bombing. The city was decorated with the silver medal for civil merit, an award granted by the Italian Republic.\n\nIt is the main commercial, industrial and agricultural centre of the Marsica area, with important high-tech industries and a large Telespazio satellite farm.\n\nThere are different common etymologies for the name of the city: from \"Ad Vetianum\" which means a \"to the Vetia family\"; from \"Avidianum\" or \"fundus Avidianus\" which is derived from the noble Avidius domiciled in the nearby town of Alba Fucens or from \"Ave Jane\", an invocation to the Roman god Janus.\n\nThe presence of hunters dates back to the palaeolithic period about 18,000 to 14,000 years ago. There are several sites that bear witness to the presence of humans in prehistoric times, as in the Cave of Ciccio Felice located just south of Avezzano.\nThe first major settlements in this area began with the construction works for the lake's drainage ordered by Emperor Claudius in the first century A.D.\n\nIn 591 in the area came under the control of Ariulf and the duchy of Spoleto. Charlemagne, after the mid-700s, donated Gastald of the Marsi and all the lands of the duchy to the papal states. So originated the county of the Marsi.\nIn the late middle ages the victory of Charles of Anjou led to the destruction of Albe and Pietraquaria whose people had sided in favor of Conradin, duke of Swabia, defeated after the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268.\nIn the fourteenth century in Avezzano ended the process of aggregation of the various villages that make up the urban center.\n\nIn the 15th century Avezzano was under Gentile Virginio Orsini, who built the castle in 1490. In the fifteenth century occurred the victory of the Colonna family over Orsini. Their lordship lasted about three centuries. The castle of Avezzano in 1565 was expanded by Marcantonio Colonna and was later converted into a fortified palace.\n\nAvezzano once lay on the shores of the largest lake in peninsular Italy, Lake Fucino, which was drained in the late 19th century. After the draining of the Lake, wide fields became available for cultivation and the area underwent terrific growth. It was completely destroyed by one of the worst recorded earthquakes in the history of Italy on the early morning of January 13, 1915 with only Palazzi's house and a wing of Orsini-Colonna castle spared. More than 30,000 people died.\nThe town streets were then completely rebuilt along straight, parallel lines, with wide green areas and villas in the Liberty style.\n\nDuring World War I and World War II, a concentration camp was located near the city, where foreign war prisoners were interned. During World War II, Avezzano was liberated by elements of the New Zealand Army (2nd New Zealand Division) on 10 June 1944.\n\nThe city is located north-west of the Fucino. It is dominated in the north by Mount Velino and west by Mount Salviano. Avezzano is considered \"the city territory\" of Marsica, Abruzzo sub-region that includes 37 municipalities, for a total of about 134,000 inhabitants. \nThe city is located about 100 kilometers east of Rome, 110 km west of Pescara and 55 km south of L'Aquila.\n\nThe urban center of the old city revolves around the Castello Orsini-Colonna (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Orsini-Colonna Castle<nowiki>\"</nowiki>). To the east the territory extends to the villages of San Pelino and Paterno. It is situated between 695 meters s.l.m. in the urban sector and 740 meters in the north, the land of which is a slight uphill slope to the north-northwest.\n\nNeighbourhoods (alphabetical order):\n- Barbazzano\n\n- Borgo Angizia (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Angitia Village<nowiki>\"</nowiki>) \n\n- Borgo Pineta (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Pinewood Village<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- Centro (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Centre<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- Cesolino\n\n- Chiusa Resta (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Resta Estate<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- Cupello\n\n- I Frati (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>The Friars<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- La Pulcina (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>The Chick<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- Piazza Cavour (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Cavour Square<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- San Rocco (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Saint Roch<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- San Nicola (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Saint Nicholas<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- Sant'Andrea (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Saint Andrew<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\n\n- Scalzagallo\n\n- Via Napoli (<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Naples Street<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\nBecause of its geographical location, situated as it is in the former bed of the Fucino and surrounded by towering hills, Avezzano is characterized by a Mediterranean mountain climate. Based on climatic averages for the period 1951–2000 published by the agency ARSSA (Regione Abruzzo), and climatic averages related to thirty years of reference 1961–1990, the average temperature of the coldest month, January stood at +2,0 °C; that of the hottest month, August, +20.5 °C. In summer sometimes temperatures exceed 30 °C.\nThe Climate classification is: Zone E, 2561 GR / G.\n\nThe city, having been completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1915, has no monuments of particular interest as do other locations in the region of Abruzzo. However, you can see some important remains of its ancient history.\n\nThe castle was built in 1490 by Gentile Virginio Orsini, who had it built around a pre-existing medieval tower of the twelfth century; it is square, with round towers at the angles. The castle project was probably led by the engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini. In the sixteenth century the castle was expanded by the order of Marcantonio Colonna, becoming an elegant residence. Severely damaged by the earthquake of 1915, it was partially restored after 1990.\n\nThe tunnels are located south of the city. They were built by the emperor Claudius between 41 and 52 AD by which the emperor made the first attempts at draining the huge Lake Fucino. To create the tunnels and the main gallery, 25,000 slaves were needed. They dug 32 wells and six tunnels. The lake was largely drained, but with the fall of the Roman Empire the tunnels were obstructed and the lake returned to its previous levels. Many centuries later, Alessandro Torlonia completed the work by finally draining Lake Fucino, building on the original project of the emperor Claudius and turning the land under the great lake into a fertile plain. In 1977, the tunnels were opened as an archaeological park.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Bartholomew was built in 1000 and documented in the thirteenth century. After its destruction as a result of the earthquake of 1915, it was rebuilt after 1940 in the new central square of Avezzano. The facade is neo-Renaissance travertine. The three portals are topped with mosaics depicting Christ and the two protectors of Avezzano, the Virgin Mary and St. Bartholomew. The church inside presents three large naves and a valuable organ placed in the church in 1955.\n\nThe original church was destroyed by Charles I of Anjou after the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268 and rebuilt a few centuries later. In 1915, it did not suffer serious damage and was home to many survivors of the quake.\n\n7 kilometers north of the city is situated the Roman archaeological site of Alba Fucens.\nIt was founded by Rome as a Latin colony between 304 and 303 BC in the territory of the Aequi, on the frontier of the Marsi, in a strategic position. It is on a hill just north of the Tiburtina-Valeria, the ancient road from Rome to the Adriatic regions. Excavations were carried out since 1949 by the University of Leuven in Belgium, led by professor Fernand De Visscher.\n\nThe nature reserve, established in 1999, covers 722 hectares west of the town of Avezzano on Mount Salviano. It has a rich variety of plants and different animal species that characterize its fauna and flora. At the center of the reserve is located the Sanctuary of the Madonna of Pietraquaria surrounded by numerous trails frequented by sportsmen and nature lovers.\n\n\nMany farms in the plain of Fucino are distinguished by the quality of the vegetables. Particularly popular is the Fucino potato which obtained the recognition of the quality label \"Protected Geographical Indication\". Several qualities of vegetables: carrot highland Fucino (PGI), radishes, salads and all kinds of horticultural products. In Abruzzo, 25% of agricultural GDP comes from Fucino plain.\n\nBuilt in the 1970s just outside the city in the direction of Luco dei Marsi, the industrial park includes numerous industrial and manufacturing enterprises and is the economic engine of the province. Among these are Micron Technology and L-Foundry, electronics giants engaged in highly specialized manufacturing. Around 1,600 workers are employed at the fabrication center \"Innovation & Technology\" in Avezzano. Also located here are Arab TV, Kidco, the Burgo group, FIAMM, Saes, Presider, Presafer and several other specialized firms.\nNearby in the Fucino plain is located the Telespazio satellite farm, one of the major global operators of satellite services.\n\nCommerce plays a very important role for the city in retail trade, digital service industries and traditional service industries. Large commercial areas are located on the Tiburtina Valeria street, between Roma street and Cappelle dei Marsi and along XX Settembre street, just outside the city. The so-called \"natural shopping center\" consists of the activities in the city center.\n\nNear Avezzano there are parks, valleys, cities and the natural environment of the Abruzzi mountains: National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise, Sirente-Velino Regional Park, Fucino plain, Mount Velino, Ovindoli, Tagliacozzo, Giovenco valley, Roveto valley and Cavaliere plain.\n\nThe football squad is Avezzano Calcio who play at the Stadio dei Marsi. \nThe rugby team is Avezzano Rugby.\n\n\nAvezzano is twinned with:\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It was originally released on November 28, 1988 in broadcast syndication. Directed by Winrich Kolbe, it was written by Jack B. Sowards.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the \"Enterprise\" becomes enveloped by a void in space where the crew is tested by a powerful alien presence.\n\nWhile on a charting mission, the Federation starship \"Enterprise\", under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, discovers a zone of pure blackness in space; probes launched into the area simply disappear. As they study it further, the zone expands and soon envelops the \"Enterprise\", leaving them in a black void with sensors reporting complete nothingness outside. Picard orders the ship on a return course, but they find that they cannot escape; they leave a stationary beacon behind them, only to have it reappear ahead of them again.\n\nA Romulan Warbird suddenly decloaks in front of the ship and attacks, and Picard orders the crew to return fire; they destroy the Warbird, but Picard is suspicious of how easily this occurs. The crew then detect what appears to be their sister ship, the USS \"Yamato\", approaching, but it does not respond to hails. Commander Riker and Lt. Worf beam over to search the ship, where they find it empty with various inconsistencies in its construction, including more seemingly impossible physical loops. The \"Enterprise\" then detects an exit from the darkness, but cannot lock onto the away team to retrieve them before the opening disappears. The \"Yamato\" begins to fade away, but the \"Enterprise\" is able to beam Riker and Worf back just in time. More openings appear in the blackness, each closing as soon as the \"Enterprise\" approaches them. Picard realizes that they are being manipulated, and orders a full-stop.\n\nSuddenly, an entity with a distorted, almost childlike face as a result of it attempting to look humanoid, appears in the void, calling itself Nagilum. It announces its curiosity about humans and their \"limited existence\" and would like to test the limits of the human body. It causes Ensign Haskell to experience violent convulsions, and he then falls to the floor dead. Nagilum then states that it wants to know everything about death, asserting that it would take less than half of the \"Enterprise\"s crew to complete its experiments. Picard decides to activate the ship's self-destruct sequence rather than to submit to Nagilum's whims. As the crew prepares for their end, Picard is tested again by Nagilum through peculiar behavior displayed by doppelgangers of Counselor Troi and Lt. Commander Data, both of whom question the self-destruct order. After these facsimiles are gone and the countdown nears zero, the void suddenly vanishes, leaving the \"Enterprise\" in normal space. Picard orders the ship to move away at high speed, and when he is finally satisfied that they are truly free, cancels the self-destruct sequence. As the \"Enterprise\" continues on its mission, Picard is met by the face of Nagilum on his ready-room computer. Nagilum offers its evaluation of humanity, criticizing the species's faults and claiming they have nothing in common with its kind. Picard disagrees, pointing out that their recent encounter shows that both species are curious, a logical statement to which Nagilum concedes before disappearing.\n\n\nIn 2018, CBR ranked noted the Nagelium as a strong characterization of Star Trek, in particular it they note how it deceives yet also causes trouble for the crew of the Enterprise 1701-D. The appearance of the USS Yamato was also noted.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2080218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080218", "title": "Communist Workers' Party of Germany", "text": "Communist Workers' Party of Germany\n\nThe Communist Workers' Party of Germany (; KAPD) was an anti-parliamentarian and left communist party that was active in Germany during the time of the Weimar Republic. It was founded in April 1920 in Heidelberg as a split from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Originally the party remained a \"sympathising member of Communist International.\" In 1922 the KAPD split into two factions, both of whom kept the name but are referred to as the KAPD Essen Faction and the KAPD Berlin Faction.\n\nThe KAPD Essen Faction was linked to the Communist Workers International.\n\nThe Entschiedene Linke decided unanimously to join the KAPD during its congress of 4–6 June 1927.\n\nThe party published a paper, \"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung\".\n\nThe roots of the KAPD lie in the left-wing split from the Social Democratic Party (SPD), calling itself the International Socialists of Germany (ISD). The ISD consisted of elements which were to the left of the Spartacus League of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. The Spartacists and the ISD entered the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), the centrist split from SPD, in 1915 as an autonomous tendency within the party. The left-wing of the USPD, consisting of Spartacists and ultra-left council communists went on to form the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1918. In 1920, the ultra-lefts of this party, mainly consisting of council communist members whose origins lay in the ISD, split from it to form the KAPD.\n\nThe KAPD was formed on 3 April 1920 by members of the left wing of the KPD who had been excluded at the Heidelberg Party Conference of the KPD (20–23 October 1919) by the central leadership under Paul Levi. Their main goal was an immediate abolition of bourgeois democracy and the constitution of a dictatorship of the proletariat, although they decided against a one-party dictatorship in the Russian model. The KAPD especially rejected the Leninist form of organisation along with democratic centralism, participation in elections, and activism within reformist trade unions, unlike the KPD. The Dutch communist theoreticians Anton Pannekoek and Herman Gorter played an important role within the KAPD; they had, on the model of the KAPD, formed the Communist Workers' Party of the Netherlands (KAPN), which however never attained a similar status to that of the KAPD.\n\nThe origins of the KAPD's establishment lay in the Kapp Putsch. In the view of KPD's left wing, this event had shown that the behaviour of the KPD party leadership was synonymous with giving up the revolutionary fight, as the KPD's position on the general strike had changed several times, and in the Bielefeld Agreement of 24 March 1920 the KPD had consented to the disarmament of the Ruhr Red Army. The Berlin district group on 3 April 1920 called a congress of the left wing. There it was decided to form the KAPD. The delegates, according to estimates, represented 80,000 KPD members. The newly formed party advocated the ending of parliamentary activities, and the active fight against the bourgeois state. In the coming period it worked closely with the General Workers' Union of Germany (AAUD). The main bastions of the party were in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen and East Saxony, all places in which a large part of KPD members switched allegiance to the new party.\n\nIn August 1920, the founding members of the Hamburg branch were expelled, Heinrich Laufenberg and Fritz Wolffheim, who had advocated National Bolshevist ideas. Two months later another founding member, Otto Rühle, was expelled. From 1920 to 1921 the KAPD was a coopted member of the Third International.\n\nIn 1921 the KAPD cooperated again with the KPD during the March Action. This was triggered by Weimar Republic troops marching into the industrial region of Central Germany, and the KAPD and KPD's fear that the military intended to occupy the factories.\n\nIn 1921 a further fragmentation occurred, when parts of the AAUD around Rühle, Franz Pfemfert and Oskar Kanehl broke off from the KAPD and formed the AAUE.\n\nAfter 1921, when the KAPD still had over 43,000 members, the party's influence declined more and more, and it separated in 1922 into the Berlin Tendency and the Essen Tendency around Alexander Schwab, Arthur Goldstein, Bernhard Reichenbach and Karl Schröder. The main reason was the Essen Faction's rejection of participation in workers' struggles in factories, in a situation seen as revolutionary. The Essen Tendency founded the Communist Workers' International, but dissolved in 1927. The Berlin Tendency was the larger and more enduring group, surviving until 1933, when it merged into the Communist Workers' Union.\n\nThe AAUD, which was formed as factory organisations in opposition to the traditional trade unions, affiliated with the KAPD. The AAUD was formed by the German leftists who considered organising based on trades as being an outmoded form of organisation and instead advocated organising workers based on factories, thus forming the AAUD. The factory organisations in the AAUD consisted the basis for organising workers' councils.\n\nA section led by Otto Rühle, based in Essen, split from the AAUD, forming the General Workers' Union of Germany – Unitary Organization (AAUD-E).\n\nThe delegates of the KAPD to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern were scorned and their speeches were restricted to a mere ten minutes. This was following the publication of Lenin's \"Left Wing Communism\", which was written as a critique of the left-wing ideas of the KAPD, among other parties, the KAPN and related leftist parties. \"Theses on the Role of the Communist Party in the Proletarian Revolution\", adopted by the 2nd World Congress also explicitly criticize KAPD for their position about the role of the Communist Party. Following the exclusionary attitude shown towards them by the Comintern, the KAPD broke with the International in 1921. Historian E.H. Carr has argued that the 2nd World Congress — to some extent unintentionally and unconsciously — was the first to \"establish Russian leadership of Comintern on an impregnable basis.\"\n\nAlthough German left-communists from KAPD are often understood as same opposition towards the Comintern as Italian Communist Left from then Communist Party of Italy, PCd'I, a tendency also known as Sinistra Comunista, nowadays represented by International Communist Party, between these two \"lefts\" were fundamental political divergencies - party role, trade unions, class and party, anti-parliamentarism in principle, - Sinistra held same criticism towards KAPD as the Comintern on 2nd World Congress and these divergencies were not patched up with progressive stalinization of the Comintern. Amadeo Bordiga, leader of Sinistra in that time, who met members of KAPD in person in Berlin on his route to Moscow, was in a later letter to Karl Korsh from 1926 even sceptical of possilibity of join activity between the two \"lefts\" because of fundamental political divergencies and stated: \"(...) We agree with Lenin's theses at the 2nd Congress. (...)\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2080219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080219", "title": "Ralph Van Deman", "text": "Ralph Van Deman\n\nRalph Henry Van Deman (1865–1952) was a United States Army officer, sometimes called \"The Father of American Military Intelligence.\" General Van Deman is in the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.\n\nVan Deman was born in Delaware, Ohio, and graduated from Harvard in 1888. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry in 1891 after attending law school, and enrolling in medical school. He received his medical degree from the Miami Medical School in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1893.\n\nVan Deman then entered the Army as a surgeon, before attending the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth in early 1895. There he met Arthur L. Wagner who became head of the War Department's Military Information Division in 1896. In June 1897 Van Deman followed Wagner to Washington to work for MID.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War Van Deman collected information on the military capabilities of Spain in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines and had charge of the White House war map. At the end of hostilities he went to Cuba and Puerto Rico to collect cartographic data. He was reassigned to the Philippines in April 1899 as aide to Brigadier-General Robert Patterson Hughes. After two years he was promoted to Captain and was moved to the Bureau of Insurgent Records in Manila, which he helped transform into the Philippine Military Information Division. He organized a counter-intelligence group using locally recruited agents. (See Philippine–American War).\n\nHe returned to the U.S. in late 1902, where he served as aide to the Commanding General, California, and then commanded Company B, 22nd Infantry, based at Fairbault, Minnesota. In 1904 he was one of nine officers selected for the first class of the Army War College (Another was John J. Pershing.) After graduation in 1906, he and Captain Alexander Coxe were sent on a covert mission to China to reconnoiter and map lines of communication around Peking. He returned to Washington in 1907 to become the Chief of the Mapping Section in the Second Division of the new General Staff. (On 26 October 1909 his wife became the first American woman to fly from American soil, being piloted by Wilbur Wright). He returned to the Philippines in 1910. There he resumed his project to map Chinese railways, roads and rivers until Japanese protests led to his expulsion in 1912.\n\nBack in the United States he taught cartography, then became Inspector-General with the 2nd Division. Now a major, he returned to the War College Division in July 1915. He found that there was a general apathy about intelligence-gathering, and the MID had been downgraded from the second division of the General Staff, and merged with the third division, ending its separate identity. Van Deman wrote a history of MID detailing its beginnings in 1885, its rise in 1903, and fall in subsequent years. He was convinced that the Army must have a coordinated intelligence organization if it were to avoid defeat in the near future, especially as it was now obvious that the U.S. would soon be involved in the war in Europe. Eventually Van Deman was able to get an audience with the Secretary of War to present his case. There he convinced the War Department to accept his idea of an intelligence department for U.S. forces. A crucial role was played by Colonel Claude Dansey of the British Security Service in proposing similar ideas to Colonel Edward M. House, a member of an American liaison mission to Britain and one of President Wilson's advisors.\n\nAs the result of these efforts the Military Intelligence Section, War College Division, War Department General Staff, was created on 3 May 1917, with Van Deman, now a Colonel, at its head. His friend and colleague Alexander Coxe was the first officer appointed. By the war's end in 1919, it had grown to 282 officers and 1,159 civilians, most of them specialists. One of these was Herbert Yardley, a cipher clerk with the State Department who Van Deman made a first lieutenant and put in charge of codes and ciphers.\n\nVan Deman modeled the new organization on British Army intelligence and divided it into several departments:\n\nAs well as military intelligence gathering, MID was also tasked with preventing sabotage and subversion by enemy agents or German sympathizers on US soil. Short of manpower, Van Deman relied on private groups which he organized into the American Protective League. He also provided security to government offices, defense plants, seaports, and other sensitive installations. He created a field organization in eight US cities which employed mobilized civilian policemen to perform security investigations. In France, MID provided operational intelligence to the American Expeditionary Force, and Van Deman created the Corps of Intelligence Police (forerunner of the Counter Intelligence Corps), recruiting fifty French-speaking Sergeants with police training. Thus, within a few months, he had created an intelligence organization that could support both domestic and tactical intelligence requirements.\n\nIn 1918 Van Deman went to France to work for Colonel Dennis Nolan, G2 of the AEF, handing over control of the MID to Brigadier-General Marlborough Churchill. After overseeing security at the Paris Peace Commission, he returned to Washington in August 1919 to briefly serve as Deputy Chief of the MID. In March 1920 he returned to the army and commanded the 31st Infantry in the Philippines. He also spent three months on detached service with the British Army in India.\n\nHe returned to the US and had a series of tours with the National Guard. He worked in the Washington headquarters of the Militia Bureau, then served as an instructor with the 159th Infantry Brigade in Berkeley, California. As a Brigadier-General he commanded the 6th Infantry Brigade at Fort Rosecrans, San Diego, California from 1927. He was promoted to Major-General in May 1929, and commanded the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington. He retired in September 1929 after 38 years of service.\n\nAfter retiring he used the contacts he had established during World War I in the American Protective League to privately compile files on suspected subversives and foreign agents.\n\nDuring World War II he acted as a consultant on intelligence matters to the War Department, for which he received a Legion of Merit. Notable among his recommendations was that he sent a passionate defense of Japanese-American citizens to President Roosevelt; the advice that they were not a threat was, however, ignored (leading to the Japanese American internment).\n\nVan Deman Street, located within the former Fort Holabird in Baltimore, MD; is named after him in honor of his service in Military Intelligence.\n\nIn January 1952, at the age of 86, he died in his home in San Diego.\n\n\n\"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Colonel (Infantry) Ralph H. Van Deman, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. As Chief of the Military Intelligence Branch, General Staff, in organizing the Intelligence Service of the Army in the United States, to Colonel Van Deman's ability, untiring zeal, and devotion to duty the building up of a very efficient Intelligence Service of the Army was largely due.\"\nGeneral Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 73 (1919) \n\n"}

{"id": "2080240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080240", "title": "Mattawa, Ontario", "text": "Mattawa, Ontario\n\nMattawa is a town in northeastern Ontario, Canada on Algonquin Nation land at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers in Nipissing District. Mattawa means \"Meeting of the Waters\" in the Algonquin language. The first Europeans to pass through this area were Etienne Brulé and Samuel de Champlain.\n\nThe area was first inhabited by native peoples who used the Mattawa River as an important transportation corridor for many centuries. In 1610, Étienne Brûlé and in 1615, Samuel de Champlain were the first Europeans to travel through the Mattawa area. For some 200 years thereafter, it was a link in the important water route leading from Montreal west to Lake Superior. Canoes travelling west up the Ottawa turned left at \"the Forks\" (the mouth of the Mattawa) to enter the \"\"Petite Rivière\"\" (\"Small River\", as compared to the Ottawa), before continuing on to Lake Nipissing.\n\nOther notable travellers who passed by Mattawa include: Jean Nicolet in 1620, Jean de Brébeuf in 1626, Gabriel Lallemant in 1648, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers in 1658, La Verendrye in 1731, Alexander MacKenzie in 1794, and David Thompson in 1812.\n\"Mattawa House\" was established by the Northwest Company in 1784. In the 1820s and 1830s, the Hudson's Bay Company (after it had merged with the Northwest Company) sent canoe brigades from their Fort Coulonge Post to the Mattawa River junction in order to trade furs. In 1837, a permanent post was established, but was moved to a new site in the centre of present-day Mattawa in 1843. It was subordinate to Fort Témiscamingue and Fort Coulonge, but after the arrival of the telegraph in 1871 and the railroad in 1880, it became the headquarters of the Timiskaming District. As the fur trade diminished and the population grew, the post became a general store, trading merchandise to supply lumbermen. It closed in the early 20th century (1908 or 1912, depending on source).\n\nIn the 19th century, Mattawa became a hub for the logging industry, which would harvest large untouched stands of white pine in the area and use the Mattawa River to transport logs to sawmills. In 1881, the railroad was built to Mattawa. It was mostly built by French Canadian labourers. After the railroad's completion, some of these labourers and their families settled in Mattawa (and surrounding areas), bringing with them their culture and heritage.\n\nLogging is still an important industry in this region, and nearby provincial parks and wilderness support the camping/hunting/fishing tourism industry in Mattawa today. Mattawa is located on the Canadian Pacific Railway Chalk River subdivision, connecting Smiths Falls and North Bay, with an additional connection to Témiscaming, Quebec.\n\nMattawa elected Canada's first-ever Black mayor, Firmin Monestime, in 1963. Monestime served as mayor until his death in 1977.\n\nIn April 2010, the old Mattawa hospital (visible as the red building in the adjacent image) was demolished amid controversy, since the building was a local landmark for which heritage status was considered. A new Mattawa Hospital had been in service for about a year. The area is also served by the regional hospital in nearby North Bay. The old hospital site is expected to be used for the construction of a new secondary school, funded by the Province of Ontario through the Conseil Scolaire de District Catholique Franco-Nord.\n\n\n34% of Mattawanians are Francophone, although the seasonal nature of local employment results in population and demographic fluctuations throughout the year.\n\nMattawa is the site of many large wooden statues depicting local historical figures, such as Champlain, Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Médard des Groseilliers, and others. The Mattawa District Museum prominently features a statue of Big Joe Mufferaw, a regional folk hero. The statues are placed widely throughout Mattawa, and in two locations outside the town on nearby Highway 17.\n\nOne of the landmarks visible from Mattawa are three crosses on the mountain on the east side of the Ottawa River immediately opposite the mouth of the Mattawa river. The crosses have been replaced several times. They are accessible via a trail which begins at the Quebec end of the railroad bridge which crosses the river at Mattawa. The view from the three crosses is a spectacular panorama of the town and of the two rivers.\n\nMattawa provides access to numerous dropping off points for canoeing or boating on the Ottawa River. The river acts as a natural border between the hills of the province of Quebec and Ontario. The Mattawa River flows through the Canadian Shield, and wildlife can often be seen and heard. The area offers fishing, camping, and hiking. There are numerous motels, campgrounds, and retreat centres in and around Mattawa.\n\nJust west is Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park, on the Mattawa River. The park is also home of the Canadian Ecology Centre, an eco-friendly retreat centre that is facilitated to accommodate business retreats. Algonquin Provincial Park can be accessed from the north side in Kiosk or the east side in Brent.\n\nThe town and nearby area contain over of year-round ATV and snowmobile trails, known as the Voyageur Multi Use Trail System (VMUTS).\n\nIn 2007, Mattawa and the townships of Bonfield, Papineau-Cameron, Mattawan and Calvin were rebranded as a single \"Mattawa Voyageur Country\" tourist region, in order to promote the area.\n\nEvery summer since 1997, the Mattawa Voyageur Days Festival is held the last weekend (Thursday-Sunday) of July. It is organized by the Town of Mattawa. Concerts take place behind the Museum on Explorer's Point, with many other events and attractions around town. Some of the events include a regional talent night, car show, lumberjack competition, and canoe race. Live music is a large part of the Festival, and has in the past included such notable Canadian musicians as April Wine, Trooper, Saga, Loverboy, Honeymoon Suite, Chuck Labelle, David Wilcox, Peter Frampton, Heart, Tom Cochrane and as well as Survivor. Up-and-coming artists from inside and outside the region take the stage on the Thursday night.\n\nOn the Sunday night, at dusk, there is a traditional choreographed fireworks show.\n\nMattawa Voyageur Days celebrated its 10th anniversary in July 2007, selling out of its 7,000 admission wristbands before the event had begun. In 2008, Festivals and Events Ontario listed Mattawa Voyageur Days as one of the Top 100 Ontario Festivals.\n\nBlue Rodeo released a song called \"Mattawa\" on their 2013 album \"In Our Nature\". Mattawa is also mentioned in the Stompin' Tom Connors song \"Big Joe Mufferaw\", which references a Canadian folk hero named Big Joe Mufferaw who supposedly \"paddled into Mattawa, all the way from Ottawa in just one day.\"\n\nMattawa is served by two low-power AM repeaters of Greater Sudbury's CBC Radio stations, including one FM radio station CJTK-FM:\n\nThe town is otherwise served by radio stations from North Bay.\n\nMattawa's weekly newspaper \"The Mattawa Recorder\" has been in publication since 1972. It is owned and published by Tom and Heather Edwards.\n\n\n\n"}

In , he became the first Japan-born player to play in the World Series, where he went 1 for 6 with three strikeouts. He ended his three-year stint in American baseball by being demoted to AAA after hitting .193 for the first half of the 2003 season. He returned to Japan and played for the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters from until . He is known for his flamboyance, colorful wristbands, dyed hair, and a unique hop as he catches the ball. His uniqueness has endeared him to baseball fans and has made him one of the most popular players in the Japanese leagues despite not being in the echelon of elite active players. In fact, his popularity was what kept him off the bench during his stint with the Tigers when manager Katsuya Nomura tried to turn him into a pitcher on the rotation rather than risk his team with his mediocre play.\n\nShinjo ended his career in storybook fashion. Playing for years on losing teams in Hanshin and despite playing in the 2002 World Series, Shinjo showed emotion and shed tears as his final game crowned him a champion as he was a member of the Fighters squad that won their first Japan Series title since 1962 with a 4 games to 1 series win over the Chunichi Dragons. As Shinjo took the field for the top of the ninth inning in the final game, he was given a standing ovation from the home crowd. Before the inning began, he was visibly emotional. Although the final play was only close to him (left fielder Hichori Morimoto caught the final ball) the cameras all showed only Shinjo's dramatic reaction. Traditionally, the players toss the manager in the air for series wins first, but the players tossed Shinjo in the air first instead of manager Trey Hillman.\n\nShinjo is now a television celebrity in Japan as well as a model for his own line of clothing. He has also won the maximum 10,000,000 JPY prize in a celebrity edition of the Japanese version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", \"Kuizu $ Mirionea\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2080244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2080244", "title": "Dental lamina", "text": "Dental lamina\n\nThe dental lamina is a band of epithelial tissue seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth. The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins (in humans) at the sixth week in utero or three weeks after the rupture of the buccopharyngeal membrane. It is formed when cells of the oral ectoderm proliferate faster than cells of other areas. Best described as an in-growth of oral ectoderm, the dental lamina is frequently distinguished from the vestibular lamina, which develops concurrently. This dividing tissue is surrounded by and, some would argue, stimulated by ectomesenchymal growth. When it is present, the dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the epithelium of the oral cavity. Eventually, the dental lamina disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is resorbed. In situations when the clusters are not resorbed, (this remnant of the dental lamina is sometimes known as the glands of Serres) eruption cysts are formed over the developing tooth and delay its eruption into the oral cavity. This invagination of ectodermal tissues is the progenitor to the later ameloblasts and enamel while the ectomesenchyme is responsible for the dental papilla and later odontoblasts.\n\nDental lamina plays a key role in a cascade of events that contributes to teeth development.\n\nIt derived from horseshoe shaped primary epithelial band which is formed when thickened oral epithelium invaginates into the mesenchyme.\n\nA series of epithelial outgrowths deep into mesenchyme due to proliferation on the cranial portion of dental lamina give rise to future spot of deciduous teeth. Moreover, further proliferation on the leading edge of the lamina leads to permanent teeth development, as a result, successional lamina is formed when those permanent teeth succeed the 20 deciduous teeth. Since permanent molars do not have deciduous predecessor, they tend to develop from the general lamina which is also formed from dental lamina.\n\nIn addition, during the bell stage of tooth development, the dental lamina helps to disconnect the interaction between the oral epithelium and developing tooth by bringing the oral epithelium fragments and the tooth germs together. Breaking up of the dental lamina leads to the development of epithelial cells clusters, some of the clusters may remain instead of degenerate, those persisted clusters, called epithelial pearls, they can delay tooth eruption by creating a small cyst on the top of the developing tooth.\n\nHyperactivity or over growth of dental lamina can give rise to conditions such as Hyperdontia. Having this condition means patients have supernumerary teeth - additional teeth other than 20 primary teeth in children and 32 permanent teeth in adults.\n\nThe reasons for this condition could be any of the following:\n\nThe most acknowledged theory for supernumerary teeth is hyperactivity of dental lamina. On completion of the dentition, the dental lamina is usually destroyed and reabsorbed, but when remnants fail to resorb, it can continue to proliferate abnormally. This abnormal proliferation can form the extra tooth bud leading to supernumerary teeth.\n\n\n"}
