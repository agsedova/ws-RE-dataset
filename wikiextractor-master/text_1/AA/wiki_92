His works have been performed by all of Australia's major theatre companies, including Sydney Theatre Company, Melbourne Theatre Company, Queensland Theatre Company, State Theatre Company of South Australia, Belvoir, and many others, and have also had many international productions. His most significant plays are \"Così\", \"Radiance\" (both of which he turned into films), \"Byzantine Flowers\", \"Summer of the Aliens\" and \"The Golden Age\". In 2006 he completed \"The Boyce Trilogy\" for Griffin Theatre Company, consisting of \"The Woman with Dog's Eyes\", \"The Marvellous Boy\" and \"The Emperor of Sydney\".\n\nHis 2009 novel \"Ice\" was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. His script for 1996 movie \"Cosi\", which revolves around a group of mentally ill patients who put on a play, won the Australian Film Institute Award that year for Best Adapted Screenplay. Nowra's work as a scriptwriter also includes a credit on the comedy \"The Matchmaker\" and the Vincent Ward romance \"Map of the Human Heart\", which was invited to the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHis radio plays include \"Albert Names Edward\", \"The Song Room\", \"The Widows\" and the five part \"The Divine Hammer\", which aired on the ABC in 2003.\n\nHe has written two memoirs, \"The Twelfth of Never\" (1999) and \"Shooting the Moon\" (2004). In March 2007, Nowra published a controversial book on violence in Aboriginal communities, \"Bad Dreaming\". He was also one of the principal writers for the multi award-winning 2008 SBS TV series, \"First Australians\".\n\nNowra is also a cultural commentator, with essays and commentary appearing regularly in \"The Monthly\" and the \"Australian Literary Review\" as well as major newspapers. He has been married three times, and has also had homosexual periods.\n\nNowra was born Mark Doyle in Melbourne, to the second of his mother's three husbands. His birthdays were never celebrated with parties when he was growing up, and he could never quite understand why. His mother told him as a boy that he would hear stories about her having killed a man, but he was not to believe any version but her own, which she would not reveal until his 21st birthday. His sister later told him that their mother had killed her own father, their grandfather. On his 21st birthday, 12 December 1971, his mother confirmed this, and revealed that it had occurred on 12 December 1945, exactly five years before he was born, which was why there were no celebrations of his own birthday. His mother was charged with murder but acquitted on the ground of extreme provocation after years of alcohol-fuelled violence. She in turn was abusive towards her own son, often telling him he was stupid and worthless, making him walk down the street in his sister's dresses as a punishment, and telling him he was \"behind the door when looks were given out\". His father was also abusive when he was around, but he was an interstate truck driver who was not often home. His mother has not seen, heard or read any of his work, and he has had almost no contact with her since he left Melbourne. He has had no contact with his father at all. He developed an early love of theatre through his uncle Bob Herbert (or Bob Herbert-Hay), a stage manager for J. C. Williamson's productions.\n\nIn his early teens he realised he was bisexual. In early adulthood he had a series of same-sex encounters.\n\nIn the early 1970s he walked out of his Australian literature studies at Melbourne's La Trobe University. The subject of a tutorial was Patrick White's novel \"The Tree of Man\". Nowra stood up, said he thought it was dreadful, walked out and never returned to finish his degree.\n\nHe later had a difficult personal relationship with Patrick White. White championed Nowra's early work (\"Visions\", \"Inside the Island\"), even taking out a paid advertisement in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" when they refused to publish his letter admonishing the theatre critic H. G. Kippax, who had been negative about the plays. But Nowra never liked White's work. White could also be very negative about Nowra. He attended the premiere of Nowra's translation of Rostand's \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", but left the auditorium before the start because he thought, sight unseen, it would be uninteresting. His partner Manoly Lascaris refused to leave, so White sat out the performance in the foyer.\n\nNowra had a similarly challenging relationship with the actress Judy Davis, who appeared in some of his plays. Nowra considered both White and Davis had personalities that combined self-loathing, narcissism, ruthlessness and haughty egos.\n\nHis first plays were written at La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in 1973. Soon after abandoning his university degree, he got into his car one day and decided to drive north, as far away from his parents as possible, but without any clear destination. He reached the NSW coastal town of Nowra, when his car broke down. He had already decided to abandon his birth name, and chose Nowra because of this enforced stop. He worked in several jobs and lived an itinerant lifestyle until the mid-1970s, when his plays began to attract attention. Since this time he has lived in Sydney, mainly in Kings Cross.\n\nIn late 1974 he married the composer Sarah de Jong; they co-wrote some of the music for his stage works. In 1976 they lived in Munich, Germany for six months. They divorced ten years later, after he had an affair with her best female friend. During his marriage to de Jong, he was resident playwright of the Sydney Theatre Company in 1979–1980, and Associate Director at Adelaide's Lighthouse Theatre in 1982–1983.\n\nHe also appeared in the 1988 Australian film \"The Everlasting Secret Family\" as a shop assistant, his only film acting role.\n\nHe engaged in a number of gay relationships for some time, before marrying his second wife, television presenter Gerri Williams, at the Soho Bar in Kings Cross, in early 1997. It was attended by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. He married his third and current wife, the author Mandy Sayer, in 2003. They had worked together when they co-edited the anthology \"In the Gutter ... Looking at the Stars\" in 2000. They have separate homes not far from each other, in which their daytime writing activities are conducted, and they come together in the evening. In February 2014 they were named joint holders of the 2014 Copyright Agency Non-Fiction Writer-in-Residence at the University of Technology, Sydney.\n\nNowra's plays are studied in Veronica Kelly's work \"The Theatre of Louis Nowra\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowra has also published a number of essays:\n\n"}

It was released six months after the band had broken up, and became their highest charting album in the UK, peaking at number 5. It has been certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.\n\nThe live tracks on the double-album were taken from the band's performances at the Hammersmith Odeon in November 1982, during their final live concert tour. Since guitarist Rob Dean had left the band in 1981, Japanese session musician Masami Tsuchiya was added to the line-up on guitar and additional keyboards. The band also used backing tracks to supply additional instrumental parts (for example, in contrast to some previous tours where a guest saxophonist was recruited, many of Karn's saxophone lines were played from tape.)\n\nAlthough it is a live recording (Jansen later admitted that only the drums were actually recorded live. The rest was recorded in a studio) of their established material, the album also contains three new instrumental studio tracks (\"Oil on Canvas\", \"Voices Raised in Welcome, Hands Held in Prayer\" and \"Temple of Dawn\"), recorded separately by Sylvian, Sylvian/Jansen and Barbieri respectively (the name of Barbieri's track is taken from the novel \"The Temple of Dawn\" by the acclaimed Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima).\n\nAlthough the album was released some months following the band's much publicised split in late 1982, it was Japan's highest charting album in the UK (where it reached No. 5). The album was certified \"Gold\" by the BPI in 1988 for 100,000 copies sold.\n\nA single, \"Canton\", was released, with the B-side \"Visions of China\". It reached No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nA video version of \"Oil on Canvas\" was also released by Virgin Records. This was re-released on DVD in 2006 as \"The Very Best of Japan\", which also features many of the band's promotional videos.\n\nSeven years after the release of \"Oil on Canvas\" the four members of Japan, David Sylvian, Steve Jansen, Mick Karn and Richard Barbieri, reunited for another studio album, under the group moniker Rain Tree Crow.\n\nA remastered CD reissue came out in 2003 with the cover art changed to only showing the slightly cropped and less colourful Auerbach painting.\n\n\"All tracks written by David Sylvian unless otherwise noted\"\n\nSide A:\n\nSide B:\n\nSide C:\n\nSide D:\n\nNote: some early CD pressings of the \"Oil on Canvas\" album omit the tracks \"Gentlemen Take Polaroids\" and \"Swing\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1903351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903351", "title": "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption", "text": "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\n\nMetroid Prime 3: Corruption is a first-person action-adventure video game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. A part of the science fiction \"Metroid\" series, it is the third main installment in the \"Metroid Prime\" series. It was released in North America and Europe in 2007 and in Japan the following year.\n\nThe story of \"Corruption\" is set six months after the events of \"\". It follows Samus Aran as she confronts the Space Pirates, who have launched an attack on the Galactic Federation naval base on Norion. While fending off a Space Pirate assault, Samus and her fellow bounty hunters are infected with Phazon by her doppelgänger Dark Samus. After losing contact with the other hunters, the Federation sends Samus on a mission to determine what happened to them. During the course of the game, Samus works to prevent the Phazon from spreading from planet to planet while being slowly corrupted by the Phazon herself.\n\nThe player controls Samus using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk devices; the remote is used for jumping, aiming, and firing weapons, while the Nunchuk enables actions such as moving Samus and locking onto enemies. \"Corruption\" introduces features new to the \"Prime\" series, such as Hypermode, which allows Samus to use more powerful attacks, and the ability to command her gunship. The new control scheme featured in \"Corruption\" took a year to develop and caused the game's release to be delayed several times. The game was first shown to the public at the E3 2005 trade show.\n\nReception to \"Corruption\" has been positive, with several reviews specifically praising the gameplay. More than one million copies of the game were sold in 2007. It was re-released in August 2009 as part of \"\", a Wii compilation of the three main games of the \"Prime\" series with Wii Remote controls. Retro announced that \"Corruption\" would be the closing chapter of the \"Prime\" series; however, the next main installment, \"Metroid Prime 4\", was announced in June 2017 and is currently in development.\n\n\"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" is a first-person action-adventure game. The player controls the protagonist, Samus Aran, using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk devices. The Nunchuk enables the player to perform actions such as moving Samus and locking on to enemies and targets. The Wii Remote allows the player to execute actions such as jumping, aiming, and firing weapons.\n\n\"Corruption\" is a large, open-ended game that takes place across several planets, each with regions connected by elevators, rail systems and bridges. Each region has rooms separated by doors that can be opened when shot with the correct weapon. The gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, jumping on platforms, and shooting enemies with the help of a \"lock-on\" mechanism that allows Samus to move in a circle while staying aimed on an enemy. The \"lock-on\" mechanism also allows Samus to use the Grapple Beam to attach onto and pull objects, such as enemy shields or certain doors. The game uses a first-person view, except in Morph Ball mode, in which Samus's suit transforms into an armored ball and the game uses a third-person camera. The third person camera is also used in conjunction with the Screw Attack power-up: in this case Samus's suit emits strange energy waves as she performs a continuous jump.\n\nThe game's heads-up display simulates the inside of Samus' helmet, and features a radar, map, ammunition gauge and health meter. The player can change visors to enable new abilities such as X-ray vision, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. \"Corruption\" also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has the addition of the Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After a certain amount of time, the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a non-standard game over due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.\n\nThe events in \"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" take place six months after \"\". The game's protagonist, Samus Aran, is a bounty hunter hired to assist the Galactic Federation during its ongoing conflict with the Space Pirates. After facing initial defeat on the planet Zebes during the events of the first \"Metroid\", the Space Pirates sought to gain power by using a newly discovered mutagen called Phazon. However, Samus managed to disrupt their operations throughout the \"Prime\" trilogy and ultimately allowed the Galactic Federation to confiscate and replicate their Phazon armaments.\n\nThe Space Pirates' operation was left in disarray following defeat in \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\". In their desperation, they turned to Dark Samus, Samus's sinister doppelgänger, for aid. Dark Samus strengthened the Space Pirates' forces, while also slowly indoctrinating them into mindless servants. Their combined forces seek to corrupt the universe with Phazon by first executing a series of methodical attacks on three Federation planets: Norion, Bryyo, and Elysia. The game is primarily centered on these planets and three other locations that become accessible after completing certain in-game tasks.\n\nFleet Admiral Castor Dane, the commander of a Galactic Federation flagship \"Olympus\", calls for a meeting with Samus Aran and three other bounty hunters—Rundas, Ghor, and Gandrayda. The bounty hunters receive orders to clear a computer virus from several organic supercomputers called \"Aurora Units\", located throughout the galaxy. The meeting ends abruptly when Space Pirates attack the Federation fleet. Samus and the other bounty hunters are deployed to the planet Norion, where the Space Pirates are concentrating an attack on the Federation base. While suppressing the attack, Samus learns that a Phazon meteoroid, called a Leviathan Seed, will soon collide into Norion. Samus and the other bounty hunters attempt to activate the base's defense systems, when they are suddenly attacked by Dark Samus. With the other bounty hunters knocked out, a severely wounded Samus manages to activate the system just in time to destroy the Leviathan Seed before she falls unconscious.\n\nA month later, Samus awakens aboard \"Olympus\", where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have corrupted her. The Federation equips her suit with a Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine what happened to her missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this. Samus encounters heavy resistance from the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus.\n\nThroughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault with the assistance of the Federation troops. After stealing a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet use it to create a wormhole that leads to the planet Phaaze, the origin point of Phazon. Samus travels to the planet's core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Samus eventually appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished before flying off into space.\n\nSamus returns to Elysia, where she mourns the loss of her fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items obtained, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.\n\nRetro Studios intended to give \"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" larger environments than \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\", and enable the game to run at 60 frames per second. The developers were also interested in using the WiiConnect24 feature to provide additional content for the game that would be accessible from the Internet. Retro announced that \"Corruption\" would be the final chapter of the \"Prime\" series and would have a plot \"about closure, told against the backdrop of an epic struggle\". After the Wii Remote was revealed, Nintendo demonstrated how \"Metroid Prime 3\" would take advantage of the controller's special abilities with a version of \"Echoes\" modified for the Wii and shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2005. At the Media Summit held by Nintendo during the week of May 21, 2007, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé said that \"Metroid\" games \"never played this way before\" when referring to \"Corruption\". He also noted that Nintendo employees who had seen the game in action claimed that it \"will reinvent the control scheme for a first-person shooter\".\n\nGame director Mark Pacini stated that the biggest concern Retro had during production was the controls, which had \"too many functions for the amount of buttons\". Pacini also said the Wii Zapper, a gun shell peripheral, was never considered because it was announced when the game's development was almost done. Retro president Michael Kelbaugh said that the delays for the game's release gave them more time to tune the controller, which took a year. He also stated that while Retro did \"a great job on the multiplayer in \"Metroid Prime 2\"\", focus was centered on the single player portion of the game, which was considered to be \"the core strength of the franchise\". Art director Todd Keller declared the graphics to be focused in both texture detail and variety, with every single texture being hand-made and trying to \"make every room its own custom stage\". During development, the Nintendo EAD team involved with \"Corruption\" suggested Retro to turn Hypermode into the core of the game, saying it would enhance the tension as it made players powerful but if used excessively would lead to a game over. Retro initially disagreed, saying it would be difficult to implement the feature without dampening the entertainment value, but after discussion decided to turn Hyper Mode into a regular functionality of the game.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" was composed by Kenji Yamamoto, Minako Hamano and Masaru Tajima. The game took advantage of the increase in the amount of RAM that took place when the series switched from the GameCube to the Wii; this allowed for higher quality audio samples to be used and thus allowing a better overall audio quality. Yamamoto used Hirokazu Tanaka's musical design of the original \"Metroid\" in \"Corruption\", by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits. \"Corruption\" is the first \"Metroid\" game to feature a significant amount of voice acting, compared to previous games in the series in which Samus \"[acted] alone [... and] always came across as a lone wolf\". The producers decided to include voices to create a stronger connection between players and the characters. The characters' voices were performed by Timothy Patrick Miller, Lainie Frasier, Christopher Sabat, Edwin Neal, Claire Hamilton, Brian Jepson, Gray Haddock, Clayton Kjas and Ken Webster.\n\nThe game was first shown to the public at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2005 in a short pre-rendered trailer. It was later announced during Nintendo's press conference at the E3 2006. Nintendo revealed in May 2006 that \"Corruption\" would be released as a launch game for the Wii console, but a few months later it was delayed to 2007. In April 2007, Fils-Aimé stated in an interview that \"Corruption\" was \"not going to ship by June\" and set it at a summer 2007 release date at the earliest. Later he opined, \"when we release it, it will be perfect. And if that's a little later than folks would have liked, I'm hoping they're going to be happy.\" In late April 2007, IGN editor Matt Casamassina revealed that \"Corruption\" would be shown in detail during May of that year, and that the game would be released on August 20, 2007, in the United States. Nintendo of America later announced to have moved the release date to August 27, 2007, but Nintendo finally announced an \"in stores\" date of August 28, 2007. The game was later released in Europe on October 26, 2007, and in Japan on March 6, 2008. In the Japanese version, the game's difficulty level is decided by answering to \"a questionnaire from the Galactic Federation\", in contrast to the North American version where the difficulty level is chosen directly by the player. \"Metroid Prime\" series producer Kensuke Tanabe said that an idea for a questionnaire came from Retro Studios.\n\nCasamassina initially criticized Nintendo for its minimal marketing campaign for \"Corruption\" and compared it to the larger campaign for the original \"Metroid Prime\", which included its own live action advertisement. He concluded that the campaign was the result of Nintendo's new focus on casual games for their console. When questioned on the company's actions, Nintendo of America responded by saying, \"Nintendo fans will be surprised by the quantity and quality of \"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" information that becomes available before the game launches on Aug. 27. Your patience will be rewarded (or Corrupted).\" Following this promise, Nintendo released the \"\"Metroid Prime 3\" Preview\" channel on August 10, 2007, in North America and on October 15, 2007, in Europe. The channel, available as a free download via the Wii Shop Channel, allowed Wii owners to view preview videos of the game that included a battle sequence and previously unannounced details on new characters. The Preview channel was the first in a series of new downloadable content including videos made available in North America. The \"month of \"Metroid\"\", as named by Nintendo, included Virtual Console versions of \"Metroid\", available on August 13, 2007, and \"Super Metroid\", available on August 20, 2007.\n\n\"Metroid Prime 3\" was rereleased on August 24, 2009 in North America, alongside \"Metroid Prime\" and \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\", as a single-disc compilation, \"\". \"Prime\" and \"Echoes\" feature the motion controls and achievement systems introduced in \"Corruption\". The compilation was later rereleased on the Wii U's Nintendo eShop on January 29, 2015.\n\n\"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" received critical acclaim. \"Nintendo Power\" commented, \"The stunning visuals and immersive gameplay of the finale to the \"Prime\" series proves that the Wii is ready for the mainstream gamer.\" \"IGN\" awarded the game an Editor's Choice Award, and noted that the game was beautifully designed and the best looking game for the Wii. They also praised the inclusion of \"well-done\" voice acting, in contrast to the lack of any voice acting in most other Nintendo games. Despite stating that \"Metroid Prime 3\" was too similar to its predecessors, the review concluded that it was the best game in the \"Prime\" trilogy. \"IGN\" also said that it could be worthy of the same score as the original \"Metroid Prime\" (9.8), had it not been for the aforementioned reason. X-Play claimed that the game was enjoyable, but it had a few awkward control mechanics and was a little difficult to control on the Wii. They also said that although it was fun, there were problems that lead to odd lock-on mechanics and painful wrists from continuous motions.\n\nShane Satterfield from GameTrailers praised the more user-friendly and action-packed nature of the game compared to \"Metroid Prime\" and \"Echoes\". Satterfield also praised the superior motion-sensitive controls, stating, \"After playing \"Metroid Prime 3\" you'll never want to play a shooter with dual analog controls again, it's that good.\" He further added that those elements make \"Corruption\" \"far superior to the original \"Metroid Prime\"\". 1UP.com was enthusiastic about the new control system and said the graphics were \"some of the best visuals in gaming, period\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave \"Corruption\" a Silver award and named it one of the Games of the Month. GameSpot stated the game had enjoyable puzzles, boss battles, atmospheric levels, and smooth gameplay. It also explained that the game was more like a traditional shooter video game than an adventure shooter, and stated that the motion activated actions were too unresponsive.\n\nGamesRadar named \"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\" the 10th best Wii game of all time out of a list of 25, stating that \"Metroid Prime 3 is the ultimate achievement of the series. The formula, which was repeated several times by Corruption, has been tweaked and pruned to its most perfect point, with some of the best shooting on the system.\" In IGN's Best of 2007 Awards, \"Corruption\" received the awards for Best Wii Adventure Game, Best Artistic Design, and Best Overall Adventure Game. GameSpy ranked it as the second best Wii game of the year, behind \"Super Mario Galaxy\", and honored it as the Best Innovation on the Wii. Australian website MyWii named \"Prime 3\" as the second best Wii game currently available, behind \"Super Mario Galaxy\". Despite being released on August 27, \"Corruption\" was the fifth best-selling game of the month, with 218,100 copies sold. It also debuted at the fifth spot of the Japanese charts, with 34,000 units in the first week of release. More than one million copies of the game were sold in 2007, and as of March 2008, 1.31 million copies of the game were sold worldwide.\n\n\"\", a Nintendo 3DS game developed by Next Level Games, was announced at E3 2015; \"Metroid Prime\" series producer Kensuke Tanabe said that \"this time around we're doing a story on the Galactic Federation.\" Regarding the \"Corruption\"s ending, Tanabe wanted to create a story that centers on Samus and Sylux, noting that \"here's something going on between them. I want to make a game that touches upon .\" Tanabe added that Nintendo had no plans on releasing the next \"Metroid Prime\" game for the Wii U, stating \"it would likely now be on Nintendo's NX console.\"\n\nOn June 13, 2017, Nintendo announced during their \"Nintendo Spotlight\" presentation at E3 2017 that \"Metroid Prime 4\" was in development for the Nintendo Switch. The game would not be developed by Retro Studios, but would still be headed by series producer Kensuke Tanabe. The development would instead be led by Bandai Namco Studios in Singapore, which included some staff members who worked on the cancelled \"Star Wars 1313\" game. In January 2019, Nintendo announced that development of \"Prime 4\" was restarted, with Retro Studios returning to develop the game.\n\n"}

It is a coal mining town and at the 2016 census had a population of 8,735. In addition to the permanent population, Moranbah also has a large fly-in fly-out population in excess of 1500 who work in Moranbah's mines. Moranbah services the Peak Downs Mine, Goonyella Riverside Mine, Broadmeadow Mine, Moranbah North coal mine, North Goonyella coal mine and several other smaller mines in the region. Although one of the newest towns in the region, its central location and large population has made it the seat of the Isaac Regional Council.\n\nThe first European to explore the region was Ludwig Leichhardt in January 1845 and settled by pastoralists in the 1850s.\n\nMoranbah was established in 1969. The town was rapidly expanded in the late 1970s by the Utah Development Company to house mine workers. The town has been featured twice (once in 1977 and again in 2012) on Four Corners, an investigative news program, exploring the effects of Australia's various mining booms on local rural communities.\n\nMoranbah Post Office opened on 1 March 1971.\n\nMoranbah State School opened on 1 January 1971 with a secondary department, which became Moranbah State High School on 25 January 1976.

In microlithography typically radiation transfer casts an image of a time constant mask onto a photosensitive emulsion (or photoresist).\nTraditionally mask aligners, steppers, scanners, but also other non-optical techniques for high speed replication of microstructures are common. The concept takes advantage of high speed or parallel manipulation technologies that have been enabled by large and cheap available computing capacity, which is not an issue with the standard approach that decouples a slow, but precise structuring process for writing a mask from a fast and highly parallel copy process to achieve high replication throughputs as demanded for in industrial microstructuring.\n\nMaskless lithography follows two main paths. One is a rasterized approach by generation of a time-variant intermittent image on an electronically modifiable (virtual) mask that is projected with known means (also known as Laser Direct Imaging and other synonyms), or by direct writing, where the radiation is focused to a narrow beam that is scanned in vector form across the resist. The beam is then used to directly write the image into the photoresist, one or more pixels at a time. Also combinations of the two approaches are known and it is not limited to optical radiation, but also extends into the UV, includes electron-beams and also mechanical or thermal ablation via MEMS devices.\n\nA key advantage of maskless lithography is the ability to change lithography patterns from one run to the next, without incurring the cost of generating a new photomask. This may prove useful for double patterning or compensation of non-linear material behaviour (e.g. when utilizing cheaper, non-cristalline substrate or to compensate for random placement errors of preceding structures).\n\nThe main disadvantages are complexity and costs for the replication process, the limitation of rasterization in respect to oversampling causes aliasing artefact, especially with smaller structures, while direct vector writing is limited in throughput. Also the digital throughput of such systems forma a bottleneck for high resolutions, i.e. structuring a 300mm diameter wafer with its area of ~707cm² requires about 10 TiB of data in a rasterized format without oversampling and thus suffers from step-artefacts (aliasing). Oversampling by a factor of 10 to reduce these artefacts adds another two orders of magnitude 1 PiB per single wafer that has to be transferred in ~1 min to the substrate to achieve high volume manufacturing speeds.\nIndustrial maskless lithography is therefore currently only widely found for structuring lower resolution substrates, like in PCB-panel production, where resolutions ~50µm are most common (at ~2000 times lower throughput demand on the components).\n\nCurrently, the main forms of maskless lithography are electron beam and optical. In addition, focused ion beam systems have established an important niche role in failure analysis and defect repair. Also, systems based on arrays of mechanical and thermally ablative probe tips have been demonstrated.\n\nThe most commonly used form of maskless lithography today is electron beam lithography. Its widespread use is due to the wide range of electron beam systems available accessing an equally wide range of electron beam energies (~10 eV to ~100 keV). This is already being used in wafer-level production at eASIC, which uses conventional direct-write electron beam lithography to customize a single via layer for low-cost production of ASICs.\n\nMost maskless lithography systems currently being developed are based on the use of multiple electron beams. The goal is to use the parallel scanning of the beams to speed up the patterning of large areas. However, a fundamental consideration here is to what degree electrons from neighboring beams can disturb one another (from Coulomb repulsion). Since the electrons in parallel beams are traveling equally fast, they will persistently repel one another, while the electron lenses act over only a portion of the electrons' trajectories.\n\nDirect laser writing is a very popular form of optical maskless lithography, which offers flexibility, ease of use, and cost effectiveness in R&D processing. This equipment offers rapid patterning at sub-micrometre resolutions, and offers a compromise between performance and cost when working with feature sizes of approximately 200 nm or greater.\n\nInterference lithography or holographic exposures are not maskless processes and therefore do not count as \"maskless\", although they have no 1:1 imaging system in between.\n\nPlasmonic direct writing lithography uses localized surface plasmon excitations via scanning probes to directly expose the photoresist.\n\nFor improved image resolution, ultraviolet light, which has a shorter wavelength than visible light, is used to achieve resolution down to around 100 nm. The main optical maskless lithography systems in use today are the ones developed for generating photomasks for the semiconductor and LCD industries.\n\nIn 2013, a group at Swinburne University of Technology published their achievement of 9 nm feature size and 52 nm pitch, using a combination of two optical beams of different wavelengths.\n\nDLP technology can also be used for maskless lithography.\n\nFocused ion beam systems are commonly used today for sputtering away defects or uncovering buried features. The use of ion sputtering must take into account the redeposition of sputtered material.\n\nIBM Research has developed an alternative maskless lithography technique based on atomic force microscopy. In addition, Dip Pen Nanolithography is a promising new approach for patterning submicrometer features.\n\nTechnologies that enable maskless lithography is already used for the production of photomasks and in limited wafer-level production. There are some obstacles ahead of its use in high-volume manufacturing. First, there is a wide diversity of maskless techniques. Even within the electron-beam category, there are several vendors (Multibeam, Mapper Lithography, Canon, Advantest, Nuflare, JEOL) with entirely different architectures and beam energies. Second, throughput targets exceeding 10 wafers per hour still need to be met. Third, the capacity and ability to handle the large data volume (Tb-scale) needs to be developed and demonstrated.\n\nIn recent years DARPA and NIST have reduced support for maskless lithography in the U.S.\n\nThere was a European program that would push the insertion of maskless lithography for IC manufacturing at the 32-nm \"half-pitch\" node in 2009. Project name was MAGIC, or \"MAskless lithoGraphy for IC manufacturing\",\nin frame of EC 7th Framework Programme (FP7).\n\nDue to the increased mask costs for multiple patterning, maskless lithography is once again increasing in visibility.\n"}

Having discovered more than 30 mammal species (including new species of tree kangaroos), he served as the Chief Commissioner of the Climate Commission, a Federal Government body providing information on climate change to the Australian public. On 23 September 2013, Flannery announced that he would join other sacked commissioners to form the independent Climate Council, that would be funded by the community.\n\nFlannery is a professorial fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, University of Melbourne.\n\nFlannery was named Australian Humanist of the Year in 2005, and Australian of the Year in 2007. Until mid-2013 he was a professor at Macquarie University and held the Panasonic Chair in Environmental Sustainability. He was also chairman of the Copenhagen Climate Council, an international group of business and other leaders that coordinated a business response to climate change and assisted the Danish government in the lead up to COP 15. In 2015, the Jack P. Blaney Award for Dialogue recognized Tim Flannery for using dialogue and authentic engagement to build global consensus for action around climate change. His sometimes controversial views on shutting down conventional coal-fired power stations for electricity generation in the medium term are frequently cited in the media.\n\nFlannery was raised in a Catholic family in the Melbourne suburb of Sandringham, close to Port Phillip Bay, where he learned to fish and scuba dive and became aware of marine pollution and its effects on living organisms. He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at La Trobe University in 1977, and then took a change of direction to complete a Master of Science degree in Earth Science at Monash University in 1981. He then left Melbourne for Sydney, enjoying its subtropical climate and species diversity. In 1984, Flannery earned a doctorate at the University of New South Wales in Palaeontology for his work on the evolution of macropods (kangaroos).\n\nFlannery has held various academic positions throughout his career. He spent many years in Adelaide, including a spell as professor at the University of Adelaide, and 7 years as director of the South Australian Museum. He was also principal research scientist at the Australian Museum, during which time he worked to save the bandicoot population on North Head. In 1999 he held the year-long visiting chair of Australian studies at Harvard University. In 2002, Flannery was appointed as chair of South Australia's [Environmental Sustainability Board (South Australia)].\n\nIn 2007, Flannery became professor in the Climate Risk Concentration of Research Excellence at Macquarie University. He left Macquarie University in mid-2013. Flannery is also a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, and a Governor of WWF-Australia. He has contributed to over 143 scientific papers. \n\nFlannery was an advisor on climate change to South Australian Premier Mike Rann, and was a member of the Queensland Climate Change Council established by the Queensland Minister for Sustainability, Climate Change and Innovation Andrew McNamara. In February 2011 it was announced that Flannery had been appointed to head the \"Climate Change Commission\" established by Prime Minister Julia Gillard to explain climate change and the need for a carbon price to the public.\n\nHe owns a house with environmental features at Coba Point on the Hawkesbury River, 40 km (25 mi) north of Sydney, accessible only by boat. Although situated 6 metres above high tide, unidentified critics suggested the \"large, low-lying waterfront home\" would be underwater if his predictions of sea level rise are borne out.\n\nOn 10 February 2011, Flannery was appointed as the Chief Commissioner of the Climate Commission by the Australian Government. The Commission was a panel of leading scientists and business experts whose mandate was to provide an \"independent and reliable\" source of information for all Australians.\n\nOn 19 September 2013, Flannery was sacked from his position as head of the Climate Commission in a phone call from new Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt. It was also announced that the Commission would be dismantled and its remit handled by the Department of Environment.<ref name=\"sacked/dismantled\"></ref>\n\nBy 6 October 2013, Flannery and the other commissioners had launched a new body called the Climate Council. Flannery told ABC News that the organisation stated that it had the same goals as the former Climate Commission, to provide independent information on the science of climate change. Amanda McKenzie was appointed as CEO. Between 24 September and 6 October the new Climate Council had raised $1 million in funding from a public appeal, sufficient to keep the organisation operating for 12 months.\n\nFlannery's early research concerned the evolution of mammals in Australasia. As part of his doctoral studies, he described 29 new fossil kangaroo species including 11 new genera and three new subfamilies. In the 1990s, Flannery published \"The Mammals Of New Guinea\" (Cornell Press) and \"Prehistoric Mammals Of Australia and New Guinea\" (Johns Hopkins Press), the most comprehensive reference works on the subjects. Through the 1990s, Flannery surveyed the mammals of Melanesia – discovering 29 new species – and took a leading role in conservation efforts in the region.\n\nThe specific name of the Greater Monkey-faced Bat (\"Pteralopex flanneryi\"), described in 2005, honours Flannery.\n\nFlannery's work prompted Sir David Attenborough to describe him as being \"in the league of the all-time great explorers like Dr David Livingstone\".\n\nIn 1980, Flannery discovered dinosaur fossils on the southern coast of Victoria and in 1985 had a role in the ground-breaking discovery of Cretaceous mammal fossils in Australia. This latter find extended the Australian mammal fossil record back 80 million years. During the 1980s, Flannery described most of the known Pleistocene megafaunal species in New Guinea as well as the fossil record of the phalangerids, a family of possums.\n\nIn 1994, Flannery published \"The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People\".\n\nThe synopsis of the work regards three waves of human migration in these regions. These waves of people Flannery describes as \"future eaters\". The first wave was the migration to Australia and New Guinea from south-east Asia approximately 40 000 – 60 000 years ago. The second was Polynesian migration to New Zealand and surrounding islands 800 – 3500 years ago. The third and final wave Flannery describes is European colonisation at the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nFlannery describes the evolution of the first wave of future-eaters:\n\nWhile the book continues to be controversial in some of its hypotheses, it is a call to arms to preserve the Australasian natural heritage\n\nFlannery argues the hypothesis that at current population growth rate levels, Australasia is living beyond its population carrying capacity, to the extent that its biological stability has been damaged. European colonisation of Australia and New Caledonia brought its own artefacts and ways suitable in the ‘old world’, and yet struggle to adapt its \"culture to biological reality\". This reality is evident in Australia, where unpredictable climate combined with a lack of natural life giving resources have created a flora and fauna that have adapted over millennia to be extraordinarily efficient in the consumption of energy.\n\n\"The Future Eaters\" enjoyed strong sales and critical acclaim. Redmond O'Hanlon, a \"Times Literary Supplement\" correspondent said that \"Flannery tells his beautiful story in plain language, science popularising at its antipodean best\". Fellow activist David Suzuki praised Flannery's \"powerful insight into our current destructive path\". Some experts disagreed with Flannery's thesis, however, concerned that his broad-based approach, ranging across multiple disciplines, ignored counter-evidence and was overly simplistic.\n\n\"The Future Eaters\" was made into a documentary series for ABC Television and was republished in late 2013.\n\nIn May 2004 Flannery said, in light of the city's water crisis, that, \"I think there is a fair chance Perth will be the 21st century's first ghost metropolis\"., a warning reiterated in 2007. In April 2005, he said, \"water is going to be in short supply across the eastern states\". In June 2005 warning that \"the ongoing drought could leave Sydney’s dams dry in just two years\". Water security remains a major issue across eastern Australia.\n\nIn September 2005 Flannery said, \"There are hot rocks in South Australia that potentially have enough embedded energy in them to run Australia's economy for the best part of a century\". Also for the Cooper Basin, he proposed the establishment of a fully sustainable city where, \"hundreds of thousands of people would live\", utilising these geothermal energy reserves. He named the city, \"Geothermia\". Subsequently, in 2007, an exploration company was established. The company expected to raise at least $11.5m on the Australian Stock Exchange. Flannery took up shares in the company. In 2010, the Federal Government provided the company with another $90m for the development work. In August 2016, the geothermal energy project closed as it was not financially viable.\n\nIn October 2006 Flannery quoted a US Navy study stating that, there may be, \"no Arctic icecap in Summer in the next five to 15 years. He also quoted NASA's Professor James Hansen, \"arguably the world authority on climate change\" who said, \"we have just a decade to avert a 25-metre rise of the sea\". In February 2007, as he explained how increased soil evaporation impacts on runoff, he said \"even the [existing amount of] rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and our river systems\" and in June 2007, he said that, \"Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane, water supplies are so low they need desalinated water urgently, possibly in as little as 18 months\".\n\nIn \"The Weather Makers: The History & Future Impact of Climate Change\", Flannery outlined the science behind anthropogenic climate change. \"With great scientific advances being made every month, this book is necessarily incomplete,\" Flannery writes, but \"That should not, however, be used as an excuse for inaction. We know enough to act wisely.\"\n\nConcepts outlined in the book include:\n\n\nThe book won international acclaim. Bill Bryson concluded that \"It would be hard to imagine a better or more important book.\" \"The Weather Makers\" was honoured in 2006 as 'Book of the Year' at the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards.\n\nFlannery's work in raising the profile of environmental issues was key to his being named Australian of the Year in 2007. Awarding the prize, former Prime Minister John Howard said that the scientist \"has encouraged Australians into new ways of thinking about our environmental history and future ecological challenges.\"\n\nThat said, Howard – along with many others – remains unconvinced as to Flannery's proposed solutions. Flannery joined calls for the cessation/reduction of conventional coal-fired power generation in Australia in the medium term, the source of most of the nation's electricity. Flannery claims that conventional coal burning will lose its social license to operate, as has asbestos.\n\nIn response to the introduction of proposed clean coal technology, Flannery has stated: \"Globally there has got to be some areas where clean coal will work out, so I think there will always be a coal export industry [for Australia] ... Locally in Australia because of particular geological issues and because of the competition from cleaner and cheaper energy alternatives, I'm not 100 per cent sure clean coal is going to work out for our domestic market.\"\n\nIn 2006 Flannery was in support of nuclear power as a possible solution for reducing Australia's carbon emissions, however in 2007 changed his position against it. In May 2007 he told a business gathering in Sydney that while nuclear energy does have a role elsewhere in the world, Australia's abundance of renewable resources rule out the need for nuclear power in the near term. He does however feel that Australia should and will have to supply its uranium to those other countries that do not have access to renewables like Australia does.\n\nIn May 2008 Flannery created controversy by suggesting that sulphur could be dispersed into the atmosphere to help block the sun leading to global dimming, in order to counteract the effects of global warming.\n\nIn August 2017 Flannery hosted an episode of ABC Catalyst investigating how carefully managed seaweed growth could contribute to combating climate change via the sequestration of atmospheric carbon to the ocean floor. In January 2018 Flannery appeared on the ABC's Science program exploring whether humans are becoming a new 'Mass Extinction Event', in addition to outlining the '5 Things You Need to Know About Climate Change'.\n\nWhen, in the concluding chapters of \"The Future Eaters\" (1994), Flannery discusses how to \"utilise our few renewable resources in the least destructive way\", he remarks that\nIn late 2007, Flannery suggested that the Japanese whaling involving the relatively common minke whale may be sustainable:\n\nThis raised concerns among some environmental groups such as Greenpeace, fearing it could add fuel to the Japanese wish of continuing its annual cull. In contrast to his stance on the minke whale quota, Flannery has expressed relief over the dumping of the quota of the rarer humpback whale, and further was worried how whales were slaughtered, wishing them to be \"killed as humanely as possible\". Flannery suggested that krill and other small crustaceans, the primary food source for many large whales and an essential part of the marine food chain, were of greater concern than the Japanese whaling.\n\nIn \"The Future Eaters\", Flannery was critical of the European settlers introducing non-native wild animals into Australia's ecosystem. At the same time, he suggested that if one wanted to reproduce, in some parts of Australia, the ecosystems that existed there ca. 60,000 years ago (before the arrival of the humans on the continent), it may be necessary to introduce into Australia, in a thoughtful and careful way, some non-native species that would be the closest substitutes to the continent's lost megafauna. In particular, the Komodo dragon can be brought into Australia as a replacement for its extinct relative, \"Megalania\", \"the largest goanna of all time\". The Tasmanian devil could also be allowed to re-settle the mainland Australia from its Tasmanian refuge area.\nIn \"The Eternal Frontier\", Flannery made a proposal for what later became nicknamed \"Pleistocene rewilding\": restoring the ecosystems that existed in North America before the arrival of the Clovis people and the concomitant disappearance of the North American Pleistocene megafauna ca. 13,000. He wonders if, in addition to the wolves that have been already re-introduced to Yellowstone National Park, \"ambush predators\", such as jaguars and lions should be reintroduced there as well, in order to bring the number of elks under control. Furthermore, the closest extant relatives of the species that became extinct around the Clovis period could be introduced to North America's nature reserves as well. In particular, the Indian and African elephants could substitute, respectively, for the mammoth and the mastodon; the Chacoan Peccary, for its extinct cousin the flat-headed Peccary (\"Platygonus compressus\"). Llamas and panthers, which still survive outside of the US, should too be brought back to that country.\n\nFlannery has achieved prominence through his environmental activism. His advocacy on two issues in particular, population levels and carbon emissions, culminated in being named Australian of the Year (2007) at a time when environmental issues were becoming prominent in Australian public debate.\n\nHe is a member of the World Future Council.\n\nIn 2009, Flannery joined the project \"Soldiers of Peace\", a move against all wars and for a global peace.\n\nIn July 2018 he played a role in the Kwaio Reconciliation programme in the Solomon Islands, which put an end to a 91-year-old cycle of killings that stemmed from the murders in 1927 of British Colonial officers Bell and Gillies by Kwaio leader Basiana and his followers.\n\nIn May 2020, The Australian Newspaper wrote an article titled, Professor Tim Flannery laments his 'colossal failure' on climate activism. Flannery stated, “to look back on my 20 years of climate activism as a colossal failure”.\n\nIn February 2014, The Sydney Morning Herald wrote an article titled, Tim Flannery: a man for all climates. Flannery was criticised for making inflammatory statements. \n\nIn March 2012, The Conversation wrote an article titled, Climate and floods: Flannery is no expert, but neither are the experts. \n\nInsights wrote in March 2020, Tim Flannery’s grandiosely titled Life is a collection of writings. In the replicated chapter on Darwin, Flannery takes the well-worn but somewhat simplistic and distorted path of describing how Darwin’s evolutionary theory clashed with religious certainty. \n\nIn an interview on Radio National’s Breakfast program on 24 September 2010, Flannery explained: ‘I’ve begun to think I’ve misunderstood the scientific process. The reductionist science that I’ve practised all of my life is very good for answering small questions but I learnt as we looked at the climate problem that we can’t use reductionist science to examine that system, we have to create a model world, a virtual world.’ \n\nThe New York Times wrote, Flannery’s credibility on issues of toxicity is further undercut by repeated misstatements or overstatements of what the science reveals. In a section on nuclear power, he describes how biologists, after the Chernobyl disaster, found that certain Mediterranean shrimp species had extraordinarily high concentrations of the radionuclide polonium 210 in some organs. Flannery ominously notes that this was the poison used to murder the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. But he fails to note that a paper published in the journal Science in 1982, four years before Chernobyl, described precisely the same high level of polonium 210 in the same organs of the same shrimp species collected in the Atlantic, accounting for it as the result of natural radiation. \n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald wrote an article in 2004, The Flannery eaters, the reporting of pier reviews of Flannery's views. \n\nAndrew Bolt from the Herald Sun wrote an article in 2011, It pays to check out Tim Flannery's predictions about climate change. The article provides discredits claims Flannery made regarding capital cities will be without drinking water in a few years. Secondly, the detailed failure of Flannery recommending and influencing the Rudd Government to award $90 million dollars to Geodynamics in the Cooper Basin. Flannery has for years been a Geodynamics shareholder, a vested interest he sometimes declares. The technology Flannery said was \"relatively straighforward\" wasn't. One of Geodynamics' five wells at Innamincka collapsed in an explosion that damaged two others. All had to be plugged with cement. The project was hit by the kind of floods Flannery didn't predict in a warming world. The technological and financing difficulties mean there is no certainty now that a commercial-scale plant will ever get built, let alone prove viable, so it's no surprise the company's share price has almost halved in four months. \n\nThe ABC reported in August 2016, Geothermal power project closes in SA as technology deemed not financially viable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Legal issues with former associates Alfa Romeo prevented Ferrari from creating the Ferrari marque. The 815 raced at the 1940 Brescia Grand Prix, where both entries failed to finish due to engine problems. One of the cars was later scrapped, while the other is currently in a car collection in Italy.\n\nIn 1938, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo after running \"Scuderia Ferrari\" as their racing division. The agreement ending their association forbade Ferrari from restarting \"Scuderia Ferrari\" within the next four years. Ferrari then founded \"Auto Avio Costruzioni\" (AAC) in Modena to manufacture aircraft parts and machine tools for the Italian government. AAC specialized in the production of hydraulic grinding machines used to produce ball bearings. The company established business partnerships with other Italian firms, including Compagnia Nazionale Aeronautica and Piaggio. \n\nIn December 1939, AAC was commissioned by Lotario, Marquis di Modena, to build and prepare two racing cars for him and Alberto Ascari to drive in the 1940 Mille Miglia. The race, which was officially named the Grand Prix of Brescia, was to be run in April 1940. The resulting car was named the AAC Tipo 815.\n\nThe 815 was designed and developed by ex-Alfa Romeo engineers Alberto Massimino and Vittorio Bellentani and by Enrico Nardi. The designation \"815\" was based on the car's eight-cylinder, 1.5 L engine. This engine was largely based on the four-cylinder, 1.1 L engine of the Fiat 508 C Balilla 1100. In concept, it was two 508C engines placed end to end, but it used a specially designed aluminium block built by Fonderia Calzoni in Bologna for integrity and light weight and a five-bearing crankshaft and a camshaft designed and built by AAC to get the traditional straight-8 timing and balance. The engine used Fiat valve gear, cylinder heads (two 508C heads per engine), and connecting rods. The engine was high-tech for the time, with a single camshaft in block, two valves per cylinder, and a semi-dry sump lubrication system. Four Weber 30DR2 carburettors were specified for a total output of at 5500 rpm.\n\nThe 815 used a Fiat four-speed transmission with the Fiat gears replaced by gears made in-house by AAC. The transmission was integral to the engine block. The car had independent Dubonnet suspension with integral shock absorber at front, with a live axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs and hydraulic shock absorbers at the rear. \n\nAs Mille Miglia regulations required that racing car chassis be based on production models, the AAC 815's chassis was also derived from the Fiat 508 C Balilla.\n\nThe bodywork was done by Carrozzeria Touring using Itallumag 35, an aluminium/magnesium alloy, and was done in long, flowing forms with integrated wings. The bodywork weighed . The complete car weighed and attained a maximum speed close to .\n\nTwo 815s, numbers 020 and 021, were completed and entered in the 1940 Brescia Grand Prix, which ran nine laps of a street circuit. Rangoni and Nardi raced in 020, while Ascari and Giuseppe Minozzi raced in 021. After leading the 1500 cc class in the first lap, Ascari's car developed valve problems and broke down. Rangoni then took the lead, set the lap record for the class, and had a lead of more than half an hour when his engine failed after seven laps.\n\nCar no. 020 was sent to a scrapyard by Lotario Rangoni in 1938, following an accident. Lotario died during the Second World War and his brother, Rolando, inherited the car. Rolando attempted to recover the car from the scrapyard in 1958. After locating the car and confirming it's identity with Enzo Ferrari, he returned to collect it only to find it had been crushed during his absence, irreversibly destroying it.\n\nAscari's car, no. 021, was sold to racer Enrico Beltracchini who raced it in 1947. After selling the car to a museum and then buying it back, Beltracchini sold it again to Mario Righini. As of 2020, Type 815 no. 021 was still in Righini's collection, housed at Anzola dell'Emilia near Modena.\n"}
{"id": "1903406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903406", "title": "South African art", "text": "South African art\n\nSouth African art is the visual art produced by the people inhabiting the territory occupied by the modern country of South Africa. The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave. Archaeologists have discovered two sets of art kits thought to be 100,000 years old at a cave in South Africa. The findings provide a glimpse into how early humans produced and stored ochre – a form of paint – which pushes back our understanding of when evolved complex cognition occurred by around 20,000 – 30,000 years. Also, dating from 75,000 years ago, they found small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species.\n\nThe scattered tribes of Khoisan and San peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 BC had their own art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by Bantu and Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms.\n\nIn the present era, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of apartheid. New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. In addition to this, there also is the Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner Trek Boers and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, making for an eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.\n\nThe pre-Bantu peoples migrating southwards from around the year 30,000 BC were nomadic hunters who favoured caves as dwellings. Before the rise of the Nguni peoples along the east and southern coasts and central areas of Africa these nomadic hunters were widely distributed. It is thought they entered South Africa at least 10 years ago. They have left lots of signs of life, people toilets and rocks ('Bushman' paintings) depicting hunting, domestic and magic-related art. There is a stylistic unity across the region and even with more ancient art in the Tassili n'Ajjer region of northern Africa, and also in what is now desert Chad but was once a lush landscape.\n\nThe figures are dynamic and elongate, and the colours (derived probably from earthen and plant pigments and possibly also from insects) combine ochreous red, white, grey, black, and many warm tones ranging from red through to primary yellow. Common subjects include hunting, often depicting with great accuracy large animals which no longer inhabit the same region in the modern era, as well as: warfare among humans, dancing, domestic scenes, multiple images of various animals, including giraffes, antelope of many kinds, and snakes. The last of these works are poignant in their representation of larger, darker people and even of white hunters on horseback, both of whom would supplant the 'Bushman' peoples.\nMany of the 'dancing' figures are decorated with unusual patterns and may be wearing masks and other festive clothing. Other paintings, depicting patterned quadrilaterals and other symbols, are obscure in their meaning and may be non-representational. Similar symbols are seen in shamanistic art worldwide. This art form is distributed from Angola in the west to Mozambique and Kenya, throughout Zimbabwe and South Africa and throughout Botswana wherever cave conditions have favoured preservation from the elements.\n\nThe contemporary art scene in South Africa is as diverse and vibrant as the population and cultures in the country. Contemporary artists in South Africa have adopted new media technologies to produce varied and creative bodies of work, as seen in the work of Dineo Seshee Bopape and CUSS Group. Their art gives insight into the pressing issues of South African society. On a global scale, contemporary South African art is relevant and sought-after. A charcoal and oil on canvas work by leading South African contemporary artist William Kentridge was sold on auction for R3,5 million in London in 2012.\n\nDue the Bantu Education Act of 1955, Black South Africans were barred from receiving formal art training during the years of apartheid and as a result, the artistic movements that had originated from this community have, until recently, been distinctly classified as “craft” rather than “art.” Informal art centers, that were funded by European states, became one of the few avenues in which Black South Africans could receive some form of artistic development. Throughout this time period from 1947 to the mid-1990s, the first practitioners to receive this informal training began passing down their knowledge to younger generations of practitioners. However, the traditional canon of African art, categorized as “fine art” had been formed in the 20th century by European and U.S. art audiences. South Africa’s inequality gap is larger than that of other countries in the world so the audience for art is primarily the rich and not those who are subject to the artistic expression, giving these higher socio-economic groups a gatekeeper status in deciding what is classified as art. After the Soweto Riots of 1976, a new social consciousness emerged that retaliated against the government’s policy of segregation and effectively reexamined the classification of certain Black South African artworks. One of the first artistic styles to receive critic attention was Venda sculpting because it aesthetically appealed to white patrons while also maintaining its “artistic manifestations of ethnic diversity.” These sculptures would be considered “transitional art” rather than “craft” and would gain access into fine art galleries. Other Black artistic expressions such as beadwork, photography, and studio arts have also begun to be slowly integrated into canonical South African art forms.\n\nThe Johannesburg Biennale’s \"Africus\" (1995) and \"Trade Routes\" (1997) had a significant impact on the cultural awareness of new South African art. These events were among the first exhibitions that revealed the “new South African art” to the international community, but also other local South Africans. This gave Black South African artists a new platform to express the effects to which apartheid had influenced society. In the post-apartheid regime, artists have now been given an apparatus to protest social issues such as inequality, sexuality, state control over the personal realm, and HIV/AIDS. However, the emphasis to embody many of these social issues within Black South African art has a led to a stereotype that many young artists are now trying to escape. International pressure has been said to once again demand a level of ‘authenticity’ within South African art that portrays discourse on the topic of apartheid. Scholar Victoria Rovine goes as far as to state that “these exhibitions represent a South Africa that seeks liberation not from apartheid itself but from apartheid as an already predictable subject for artistic production.” Furthermore, although South African art is not always political, conversations stemming from its interpretation are rarely apolitical and the high demand for apartheid symbols by private collectors have raised concerns over the collection of the art for the sake of nostalgia. \n\nMajor universities and tertiary institutions offer Fine Art, Music, Photography and other creative disciplines:\n\n\n\n"}

He was most recently a member of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Owens played college football at Hawaii. He spent six seasons playing for the Toronto Argonauts, and has also been a member of the Montreal Alouettes and Saskatchewan Roughriders.\n\nOwens attended Roosevelt High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, and he was a three-sport letter-winner and star in football, basketball, and Track. In football, as a senior, he was an all—OIA white division selection, and an All-State honourable mention. As a sophomore, he garnered first team All-OIA Red Division honours, and All-State honourable-mention accolades. He was also a basketball star and as a senior, he led his team to the OIA state basketball championship. He has three children: Chad Jr., Areana, and Sierra-Lynn with his wife, Rena Owens. They’ve been together for 25 years, married for 15 years. \n\nOwens became a bigger star after joining the University of Hawaii football team as a wide receiver, punt returner and kick returner. He became the featured receiver in June Jones's Run & Shoot Offence, and became the number one receiver for quarterback Timmy Chang. Owens was instrumental on the Warriors teams that won both the Hawaii Bowl in 2003 and 2004 by beating the University of Houston and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nOwens was cut by the Jacksonville Jaguars after his NFL debut against the Indianapolis Colts where he muffed three punts. He was re-signed to the Jaguars' practice squad a few days later.\n\nPlaying with the Jaguars in his first pre-season game of the 2006 season, Owens caught a 62-yard pass and scored his first NFL touchdown.\n\nOwens signed with agent Richard \"Bruno\" Burnoski and signed a contract with the Colorado Crush of the Arena Football League. Owens got off to a fast start with the Crush, generating over 1600 combined yards (receiving and returns) but tore his ACL, ending his season after nine games.\n\nOn July 14, 2009, Owens signed a practice roster agreement with the Montreal Alouettes. He was released on October 1. He was re-signed to the practice roster on October 8 and was considered a part of the 97th Grey Cup Championship team for participating in a game during the regular season.\n\nOn June 24, 2010, the Toronto Argonauts acquired Owens from the Alouettes in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2011 CFL Draft.\n\nOn November 25, 2010, Owens was named the most outstanding special teams player in the Canadian Football League for the 2010 season. Owens was a unanimous selection after leading the CFL in punt, kickoff, missed field goal returns and all-purpose yards and finishing tied for the league lead in return touchdowns (four). He became just the fifth player in league history to have over 1,000 punt and kick return yards in a season.\n\nOn November 1, 2012, in the final regular-season game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Owens set the all-time record for all-purpose yards in a single season, surpassing Pinball Clemons' 1997 total of 3,840 yards. Owens did so with a 29-yard kickoff return halfway through the 2nd quarter. He finished the season with 3863 all-purpose yards, setting not only a CFL record, but also a professional football record as well. In his third full season in Toronto, Owens became the first player in professional football to record at least 3,000 combined yards in back-to-back seasons.\n\nOn November 22, 2012, Owens won the CFL Most Outstanding Player Award finishing ahead of Calgary Stampeders running back Jon Cornish in voting conducted by the Football Reporters of Canada as well as the eight CFL head coaches. On November 25, 2012, Owens and the Argonauts finished the 2012 season with the 100th Grey Cup Championship. Owens was rated the best player in the league on the TSN Top 50 players of 2012.\n\nOn June 8, 2013, the Argos and Owens agreed to a two-year contract extension. The deal was rumoured to make Owens the highest-paid non-quarterback in the CFL. The Argonauts did not resign Owens at the conclusion of the 2015 CFL season, rendering Owens a free agent.\n\nOn February 11, 2016, Owens agreed to a one-year contract with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a free agent. Subsequently, it was announced on October 4, after playing 12 games with the Tiger-Cats, that Owens would miss the remainder of the 2016 CFL season due to a broken foot he sustained in a game against the Montreal Alouettes. He would subsequently re-enter Free Agency after only a season with the organization.\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Owens agreed to a two-year deal with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. It was announced, on June 21, 2017, that Owens was placed on the six-game injured list due to an apparent foot injury he likely sustained while with the Tiger-Cats.\n\nOwens made his Roughriders debut on October 20, 2017 in a winning effort against the Calgary Stampeders recording five receptions with seventy eight yards. Despite his strong performance at the end of the 2017 Saskatchewan Roughriders campaign, he was part of final roster cuts for the Riders on June 9, 2018. His age and performance relative to younger players are believed to be contributing factors affecting the decision to cut ties with the player.\n\nOwens returned to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats when he signed a practice roster deal on September 11, 2018. He was released on October 1, 2018 without having played in a game.\n\nIn the off-season following the 2012 CFL season, Owens decided to pursue MMA as a form of off-season training. Then Argos GM Jim Barker openly expressed his displeasure with Owens's fighting in MMA, and was quoted as saying, \"I think he's making a bad decision, our organization thinks he's making a bad decision\". On April 6, 2013, Owens defeated Junya Tevaga by unanimous decision in an amateur bout. The organization that oversaw the fight was Destiny MMA.\n\nIn January 2015, Owens moved from Hawaii to Canada full-time; he now resides in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\n\n"}

He played college football at Oklahoma State.\n\nBajema attended Brink Junior High and Westmoore High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and was a three-sport letterwinner in: football, baseball, and basketball. In football, as a senior, he passed for 845 yards, 7 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions as the team's quarterback, and also saw playing time at defensive end. As a senior, he was named by both the Daily Oklahoman and the Tulsa World as an all state honorable mention, and also played in the Oil Bowl. While attending Westmoore High School, Bajema was also a stand out baseball player, receiving interest by major league scouts. He was also in National Honor Society and kept a high grade point.\n\nAfter arriving at Oklahoma State University, Bajema switched to tight end where he played extensively throughout all 4 seasons. He played in 46 games making 37 starts and recorded 52 receptions for 709 yards and four touchdowns.

She measured 179 metres in overall length and 25 metres in breadth, weighing 27,212 tons. Her capacity included 1,200 passengers and 370 automobiles or 77 tractor trailers. She had up to 106 crewmembers.\n\n\"Caribou\"'s design had been commissioned by CN Marine in the early 1980s and was the culmination of years of research into effective icebreaking ship designs. The resulting hull design which \"Caribou\" and \"Joseph and Clara Smallwood\" were built to is called \"Gulfspan\", named in part after the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The \"Gulfspan\" hull is unique among Canadian icebreakers in that the ship slices through sea ice, rather than using its weight to ride up onto and crushing the ice underneath. This design permits the sister ships to maintain close to regular operating speed.\n\nAt the time that \"Caribou\" entered service in 1986, CN Marine underwent a restructuring whereby the company was separated from its parent CN Rail and renamed Marine Atlantic. At the same time, CN was beginning the process of abandoning all railway service on the island of Newfoundland, which had been operating as Terra Transport. Several ferry vessels were retired and/or sold at the time that \"Caribou\" entered service and these corporate restructuring changes were taking place.\n\n\"Caribou\" regularly made the Cabot Strait crossing from North Sydney to Channel-Port aux Basques in approximately 5 hours, 30 minutes, however she had been known to break the 5 hour mark in optimum conditions but frequently comes closer to 6 hours as dictated by established schedules.\n\nThe ship was retired by Marine Atlantic on November 26, 2010 after completing her last run from Port aux Basques to North Sydney.

{"id": "1903464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903464", "title": "Highland branch", "text": "Highland branch\n\nThe Highland Branch, also known as the Newton Highlands Branch, was a suburban railway line in Boston, Massachusetts. It was opened by the Boston and Albany Railroad in 1886 to serve the growing community of Newton, Massachusetts. The line was closed in 1958 and sold to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), which reopened it in 1959 as a light rail line, now known as the D Branch of the Green Line.\n\nThe first section of what became the Highland Branch was built by the Boston and Worcester Railroad between Boston and Brookline in 1848. The Charles River Branch Railroad, a forerunner of the New York and New England Railroad, extended the line to Newton Upper Falls in 1852. The B&A bought the line in 1883 and extended to Riverside, rejoining its main line there. The MTA electrified the line when it rebuilt it for light rail use.\n\nThe conversion of the Highland Branch into a light rail line was pioneering in several ways. Amid a backdrop of failing private passenger service in the United States, it was the first time a government entity in that country had assumed full responsibility for losses on a route. It was also the only example of converting an extant commuter rail line to light rail use.\n\nWhat became the Highland Branch was built in stages. The initial segment was the Boston and Worcester Railroad's Brookline Branch, which opened on April 10, 1848. This line stretched from a junction with the Boston and Worcester main line south of Governor Square southwest to the current location of the Brookline Village station in Brookline, with an intermediate station at Longwood Avenue. Construction costs were roughly $42,000. Brookline had previously only been reachable by road (horsecar service on what is now Huntington Avenue did not begin until 1859), and the branch was quickly a success.\n\nBased on this success, the Charles River Branch Railroad was founded in 1849 to extend service west from Brookline. Beginning in 1851, the railroad built from Brookline to Newton Upper Falls. This extension opened in November 1852, at a cost not exceeding $253,000. The line was further extended to Great Plains (later part of Needham) the next year, and to Woonsocket, Rhode Island in 1863. The Charles River Branch Railroad also constructed its own track parallel to the Brookline Branch. From 1858, freight trains carrying gravel from Needham quarries to fill the Back Bay for development made up most of the traffic on the line.\n\nBy the early 1870s the Boston and Worcester had become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A), itself destined to become part of the New York Central Railroad system. The tracks beyond Brookline, which now reached Woonsocket, Rhode Island, belonged to the New York and New England Railroad, a forerunner of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. New York and New England trains used the B&A's route via Brookline to reach Boston.\n\nThe citizens of Newton were dissatisfied with their service to Boston and since the early 1870s and had pressured both the Boston and Albany and the New York and New England to improve service, without result. Among these proposals was for the NY&NE to sell part of its Woonsocket line to the B&A, which would then build west through Newton Highlands to Riverside, on its main line from Boston to Albany, New York. This would create a loop or \"circuit\" between Boston and Riverside. The founding of the Newton Circuit Railroad by a group of Newton citizens in 1882, with the stated goal of completing the circuit by building a line from Brookline to Riverside, prompted the two railroads to take action.\n\nIn 1883 the New York and New England sold the line between Brookline and Newton Highlands to the B&A for $411,400. The B&A completed the missing and opened the new branch on May 16, 1886. To encourage commuter traffic the B&A offered reduced-fare commutation tickets. The introduction of frequent service to Boston led a population boom in Newton. Three new stations on the extension opened as they were completed: Waban on August 16, 1886; Woodland soon afterwards; and Eliot in December 1888.\n\nBetween 1905–1907 the Boston and Albany undertook a project to remove grade crossings along the branch, following a similar project a decade earlier on the main line through Newton. The line's elevation was lowered by as much as in some places in order to permit road traffic to cross overhead. Lower levels were added at Newton Highlands and Newton Centre to accommodate the depressed tracks. At this time service over the line was almost exclusively passenger, with just one scheduled freight train per day. An infill station at Beaconsfield to serve magnate Henry Melville Whitney's Beaconsfield Hotel opened in 1907. \n\nThe New York Central Railroad had bought the B&A in 1900 primarily for long-distance service. After the New York Central electrified several suburban lines around New York City, the public asked for similar improvements around Boston. The New York Central studied third-rail electrification of the Highland Branch and the main line as far as Framingham in 1911, but did not find it to be cost-effective. The lines instead continued to use steam power until diesel locomotives were substituted around 1950.\n\nTrains which traveled from Boston to Riverside via the Highland Branch returned via the main line, thus completing the \"circuit\". In 1904 a round trip took 1 hour and 15 minutes. The B&A main line was quadruple-tracked between Boston and Riverside; tracks 3 and 4 were used by suburban trains. After the Needham Cutoff opened in 1906, the New Haven rerouted most trains on the Charles River line via Forest Hills rather than the Highland Branch to avoid congestion at the Cook Street junction. From 1911 to 1914, the New Haven operated \"Needham Circuit\" service operating via Needham and Newton Highlands. In 1926, the Newton Lower Falls Branch was rerouted to join the Highland Branch south of Riverside. The branch ran with overhead electrification between Newton Lower Falls and Riverside until 1930, then with locomotives until 1957.\n\nBy November 1912, the Highland Branch had 30 daily round trips, plus several Needham trains operating via Newton Highlands. This frequency dropped by one-quarter by 1919 (with many Highland Branch trains not completing the circuit on the main line), then stayed constant for two decades. The B&A upgraded Brookline Junction to centralized traffic control (CTC) in 1932, improving the flow of traffic between the branch and the main line. By 1950, the Highland Branch saw just seven daily round trips.\n\nThe Massachusetts state legislature had first proposed replacing the conventional train service on the Highland Branch with streetcars running from the Tremont Street Subway in 1926. The next major round of planning in the mid-1940s suggested the same conversion, along with a branch to Needham. The idea returned in the mid-1950s as a combination of factors, both general and specific, made the concept attractive. The commuter rail business had ceased to be profitable for most railroads in the United States. Causes included high structural costs of doing business, loss of demand outside of rush hour, and restrictive regulations. The Boston-area railroads were not immune to these trends, and as the decade wore on sought to end or reduce their money-losing commuter operations. In addition, the extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike over part of the B&A main line would reduce its capacity going forward. By 1957, daily ridership was just 3,100 passengers.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) first proposed buying the Highland Branch and rebuilding it as a light rail line in 1956, for a total estimated cost of $9 million. The MTA was attracted to the project because it could extend rapid transit service quickly and cheaply. The state legislature approved the purchase and a total expenditure of $9.2 million on June 20, 1957. By the time the New York Central ended the seven inbound and nine outbound daily trains on May 31, 1958, daily patronage on the branch had fallen to 2,200 passengers. The MTA bought the Highland Branch from the Boston and Albany on June 24, 1958 for $600,000. Even as the MTA took this action, the Boston and Maine Railroad was reducing service on its lines radiating out of North Station and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad threatened to end all service on the Old Colony Railroad lines.\n\nConstruction on the new light rail line began on July 10, 1958. A new -long tunnel was built to connect with the existing Beacon Street Line tunnel west of Kenmore Square. Streetcar stations with automobile parking were built at all the former station sites; Riverside and Woodland were both relocated to the southeast. Additional construction included a yard at Riverside; a loop, busway, and connection with the existing yard at Reservoir; an additional station at Park Drive; and overhead electrification including a new substation at the South Boston power station. The MTA reopened the branch as the Riverside Line on July 4, 1959. Total construction costs came to $8 million. Daily ridership was 25,000, ten times what the B&A trains had carried at the end. The project was \"ahead of schedule and under budget\", and ridership exceeded projections. The faster acceleration of the electric streetcars permitted faster operation between downtown and Riverside (35 minutes versus 40 minutes) than the conventional trains they replaced. While other government entities were subsidizing passenger operations around the United States, it was the only example at that time of a government entity taking on the entire cost of what had been a private operation, and the only case of a commuter rail line converted to light rail. By 1960, the line was estimated to reduce rush hour congestion in downtown Boston by seven percent.\n\nThough successful, the conversion was cheaply constructed, and further upgrades were soon needed. From June 1960 to January 1961, the MTA enlarged Riverside Yard and added a maintenance facility, upgraded the power infrastructure, and improved the signalling system. In 1967, the MBTA (which had replaced the MTA in 1964) designated the line as the Green Line \"D\" Branch as part of systemwide rebranding. Ridership on the surface section of the \"D\" Branch has remained relatively constant since 1959 - a 2010-2011 count found 24,632 weekday boardings. Short sections of the Highland Branch remained connection at both ends for freight service until the 1970s. The Lower Falls Branch between Newton Lower Falls and Riverside was out of service after 1972, leaving just the short section at Riverside Yard; the branch was formally abandoned in 1976.\n\nThe Highland Branch diverged from the Boston and Albany main line at Brookline Junction, adjacent to Fenway Park. From there the branch continued southwest into Brookline. Shadowing the branch for this portion was the \"Emerald Necklace\", a partially-completed series of parks and waterways. At Brookline the line turned west and left the Muddy River behind.\n\nIn Chestnut Hill the line passed south of the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, which opened in 1870. An even closer encounter took place in Newton Centre, where the line ran within a few feet of Crystal Lake. The grade crossing elimination project of 1905–1907 lowered the line in this area to above the lake's surface level. The B&A installed a drainage system to mitigate the heightened flood risk.\n\nAt Newton Highlands the New York and New England Railroad diverged at Cook Street Junction for Woonsocket. The Highland Branch turned back toward the B&A main line, running northwest through Waban. It rejoined the main line at Riverside Junction, from Boston.\n\nThe creation of the circuit service over the Highland Branch coincided with a \"major program of capital investment and improvements\" by the Boston and Albany. Architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who had been involved with the B&A since 1867 and designed Auburndale station for the railroad in 1881, was commissioned to design several stations for the B&A. These included the three stations opened on the new section through Newton Highlands (Eliot, Waban, and Woodland), plus a new building (completed in 1884) for the existing Chestnut Hill station. The three new stations were intended to attract real estate development to what were then lightly populated areas.\n\nAfter Richardson's death in 1886, his successor firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge designed a number of additional stations for the B&A, several of which were for the Highland Branch. These included replacements for six of the former NY&NE stations - Newton Highlands in 1887, Reservoir in 1888, Newton Centre in 1891, Brookline Hills in 1892, and Longwood in 1894 - plus Riverside in 1894. Most originally had their grounds designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Ignored in this renewal program was the circa-1870 Brookline station, dismissed by Charles Mulford Robinson in 1902 as \"disappointing...a brick structure of an earlier date.\"\n\nMost of the stations were demolished during the light rail conversion to provide additional parking spaces. However, four structures remain: the station buildings at Newton Centre, Newton Highlands, and Woodland, plus part of the baggage and express building at Newton Centre.

{"id": "1903466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903466", "title": "Stump the Schwab", "text": "Stump the Schwab\n\nStump the Schwab is an American game show that aired on ESPN2 and ESPN Classic from July 8, 2004 to September 29, 2006. The show featured three contestants trying to defeat Howie Schwab, ESPN's first statistician, in a sports trivia contest. Stuart Scott was the show's host. The show also appeared on Canada's The Score Television Network.\n\nEach episode of the show had three rounds, \"Leading Off\", a second round that featured a different game each time, and \"The Schwab Showdown.\" After each of the first two rounds, the contestant with the lowest score was eliminated.\n\nThree male contestants competed against \"The Schwab\" in a series of three rounds, with the lowest-scoring player being eliminated after each round.\n\nEach episode began with \"Leading Off\", a round where the 3 contestants and \"The Schwab\" took turns naming an athlete on a list relating to a major achievement; for example, \"In the year 1975, name the top 16 players that led the National League in home runs that year.\" This round consisted of three such lists, and each contestant was given a turn to begin a list. During the first season, the full list was displayed on screen for the home viewers, with each person who had not been named displayed in white letters, and each person correctly named having their names displayed in blue letters. Starting in the third season, answers were shown only as they were given by players, allowing home viewers to \"play along.\" At the end of the question, all answers were shown. Each correct answer was worth one point. If a contestant or \"The Schwab\" gave a wrong answer, could not come up with an answer, or provided an answer already given, he was eliminated for the rest of the topic with the spotlight shining over him darkened. If there was only one player (including \"The Schwab\") left, that player scored only one additional point by giving another correct answer. Whoever had the lowest score at the end of \"Leading Off\" was eliminated from the show, while the remaining two contestants went on to face each other in Round Two.\n\nA variety of different games were used for round two in each episode. \"The Schwab\" did not compete against the contestants in that round, but did ask some questions of contestants, and when no one gave a right answer, he would reveal the correct answer. Some of the games were as follows:\n\n\nWhichever contestant had scored the most points at the end of round two went on to face \"The Schwab\" in the Schwab Showdown.\n\nWhen there was just one contestant left, he and \"The Schwab\" faced off in a one-on-one battle. In this last round, there were four cleverly named categories, each of which dealt with one subject. For example, \"Tough Guys\" dealt with athletes named Guy, not actual tough guys. Each category had three different cards, each with a question on them. The first question in each category was worth one point, the second two, and the third three. Both the contestant and \"The Schwab\" were given a pass. If the contestant or \"The Schwab\" was unsure about an answer to a question, he passed it onto the other player. However, if that player or \"The Schwab\" still had their pass in possession, they could pass the question right back to the person it was first asked, who then had to answer it. Each incorrect answer was worth one strike, just like baseball, with three strikes ending the round immediately. The game was won either by outscoring the opponent after all questions were asked or by the other player striking out. If the contestant had more points than \"The Schwab\", then he had \"stumped the Schwab.\"\n\nOriginally, the final round was called \"The Final Table\", with questions worth 1, 3, and 5 points. Host Scott gave the players poker chips worth the point value of the question they answered correctly. He still placed strike markers in front of the contestant and the Schwab as they were accumulated.\n\nIn the first season, \"stumping the Schwab\" got a person a prize of tickets to a sporting event. If their \"Schwab Showdown\" score was good enough (whether or not they \"stumped the Schwab\"), they were invited back to participate in a tournament, where the grand prize was a job working alongside \"The Schwab\" in the research room at ESPN, or tickets for two to five major sports championships. But, that person again had to \"stump the Schwab\" to win that prize. No one won the grand prize.\n\nIn the second season, \"stumping the Schwab\" won a contestant $5,000. The semi-finals was contested among those who won the bonus round or finished with a high enough score. Those nine players had a chance at another $5,000 prize in the \"Schwab Showdown\", as well as a chance at the Grand Championship. If they stumped him once more in the championship round, they won a grand prize of $25,000. Adam Garfield of Pennsylvania won season two. The finals came down to one question and \"The Schwab\" answered it correctly. Adam won a trip to the 2005 ESPY Awards in Los Angeles as a consolation prize.\n\nIn the third season, the contestant who made it to the \"Schwab Showdown\" earned $1,000. If that contestant \"stumped the Schwab\", he earned an additional $5,000 and a guaranteed spot in the semifinals. If they \"stumped the Schwab\" in the semifinals, it was worth $15,000. A finals win earned $30,000, so theoretically, a contestant won up to $53,000 ($1,000 for each of the game wins + $5,000 + $15,000 + $30,000). Once again, however, at the end of the season, \"The Schwab\" won the final \"Schwab Showdown\", defeating Pete Fierro.\n\nThe fourth and final season saw several scoring changes. The $1,000 for winning the game stayed intact through all the rounds, but a win in the \"Schwab Showdown\" in the first round only netted the contestant an additional $1,000. In the semifinals, that went up to $5,000 for a win in the \"Schwab Showdown.\" In the championship show, the winner of the game played the \"Schwab Showdown\" for a cash jackpot which started at $9,000, and had money added to it every time \"The Schwab\" won the \"Schwab Showdown.\" The pot, which reached $30,000, was not won, with \"The Schwab\" defeating Marty Asalone.\n\nIn an episode that aired on May 24, 2005, \"The Schwab\" struck out for the very first time in the show's history, losing to a senior at Johns Hopkins University named Stephen Shukie (\"The Schwab\" is an alumnus of St. John's University) in the first college edition of the show. \"The Schwab\" only scored two points (two correct one point answers) in the whole round, while his opponent scored just four. In the same episode, it was the first time that the contestants (Shukie of Johns Hopkins University, Alec Tolivaisa of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Jonathan Evans of Tulane University) and \"The Schwab\" swept an entire Leading Off category (current AFC Head Coaches) without an incorrect answer.\n\nThe episode that aired September 25, 2006 saw \"The Schwab\" strike out again in the last game of the preliminary round of the fourth and final season.\n\nIf there was a tie at the end of any of the three rounds, then Stuart Scott asked a tiebreaker question, where the answer was a number. The person closest to that number won.\n\nIn an episode from season two, \"The Schwab\" and Nick Dembski were tied at the end of \"The Showdown.\" Scott then asked them how long in inches a baseball pitcher's rubber (or plate) is. Both came up with the correct answer — 24 inches — then crossed it out, and put 18 inches as their answer, forcing another tiebreaker question. The next tiebreaker question was \"Karl Malone appeared in how many playoff games?\" Dembski guessed 163; \"The Schwab\" guessed 237. The correct answer was 193. Being closer to the actual answer, Dembski won the tiebreaker, and thus, the game.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, auditions for the fourth and final season of \"Stump The Schwab\" took place in eight U.S. Cities including Boston, St. Louis, Los Angeles, and Baltimore.\n\nBeginning with the fourth and final season premiere on September 4, 2006, \"Stump The Schwab\" original episodes debuted on ESPN Classic.\n\n\"The Schwab\" was informed ahead of time what topics were going to be asked during the \"Schwab Showdown\" round in each episode. However, he did not know what the individual questions were.\n\nIn the championship episode, contestant Marty Asalone scored entirely perfectly in Round 2, playing \"Remember When.\" He then went on to lose to \"The Schwab\" in the \"Schwab Showdown.\"\n\nAlso, for only the second time in the show's 4-year history, a contestant \"stumped the Schwab\" twice. Brian Sandalow, then a University of Missouri journalism student, beat \"The Schwab\" in both the preliminary and semifinal shows. He did not get a chance to beat \"The Schwab\" a third time, falling in the championship show's \"Leading Off\" round.\n\nSchwab's overall record in the \"Schwab Showdown\" over the show's four season run was 64-16.\n\nHere is an incomplete list of contestants who have \"stumped the Schwab\", either by accruing more points than him in the \"Schwab Showdown\", by forcing \"The Schwab\" to strike out, or by beating him in a tiebreaker:\n\n"}

It serves as the state's primary center for multicultural education, with exhibits, programs, and events like the Texas Folklife Festival, an annual celebration of the many ethnicities that make up the population of Texas. It has been held yearly since 1972.\n\nThe facility, established by the Texas Legislature on May 27, 1965, originally served as the Texas Pavilion at HemisFair '68 before being turned over to the University of Texas System in 1969. UTSA assumed administrative control of the museum in 1973. In 1986, the System designated the Institute as a campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio. Now, it is part of UTSA's HemisFair Campus. It is located near the Alamo and the River Walk.\n\nThe Institute of Texan Cultures, through its research, collections, exhibits and programs, serves as the forum for the understanding and appreciation of Texas and Texans. The complex has of interactive exhibits and displays. The library on the third floor contains manuscripts, rare books, personal papers, over 3 million historical photos and over 700 oral histories.\n\nFunding for the museum comes primarily from three sources: biennial legislative appropriations; exhibit floor and special event admissions; grants, contributions, and other locally generated funds such as the rental of the museum's facilities, and the sale of its publications, audiovisuals, library services, and merchandise from The Museum Store. Major support is provided by the museum's Development Board. The Texas Legislature cut appropriations for the institute by 25% in 2011 causing the institute to rely more on private donations and corporate sponsorship.\n\nITC fulfills its mandate as the state's center for multicultural education by investigating the ethnic and cultural history of the state and presenting the resulting information with a variety of offerings:\n\n\nThere are displays in the museum representing many cultures and their impact on the history and development of Texas.\n\nIn early 2010, ITC became an affiliate as part of the Smithsonian Affiliates program. Affiliate status grants the institute access to the Smithsonian’s artifacts, education, and performing arts programs, expert speakers, teacher workshops, and resources to complement and broaden exhibitions. The Affiliation agreement marks a new era for the institute. A series of upgrades are planned to revitalize main exhibit floor.

{"id": "1903488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903488", "title": "Dream sequence", "text": "Dream sequence\n\nA dream sequence is a technique used in storytelling, particularly in television and film, to set apart a brief interlude from the main story. The interlude may consist of a flashback, a flashforward, a fantasy, a vision, a dream, or some other element.\n\nCommonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past. For instance in \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike. Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as Michel Gondry demonstrates in \"The Science of Sleep\". Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett points out in the book \"The Committee of Sleep\" that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's \"Spellbound\", Salvador Dalí designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. Ingmar Bergman lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and Orson Welles designed a scene of \"The Trial\" to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams.\n\nFilms normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life. In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the diegetic reality of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorists, such as Christian Metz, believe the viewer identifies.\n\nIt is also possible to retroactively explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible continuity in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with \"Dallas\", which had killed off Bobby Ewing, one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the tenth-season premiere \"Return to Camelot\" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having.\n\nAudio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence George Gershwin composed for his film score to \"Delicious\". In classic Hollywood, the wavy dissolve was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy. One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality. Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up, as exemplified by the opening sequence of \"Bring It On\" where a pep rally with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming.\n\nThis is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a plot device in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show \"Dallas\" in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed in fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the \"Family Guy\" two-part episode \"Stewie Kills Lois\" and \"Lois Kills Stewie\" are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe camera angles and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a subjective viewpoint even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view. This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as \"Strange Days\" (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the \"SQUID\" recorder, the first-person sequence of \"Doom\" (2005), the beginning of \"Enter the Void\" (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences.\n\nThe dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of Aeschylus' Athenian tragedy \"The Persians\" (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater. The first dream sequence in a film is more contested. Film critic Bob Mondello claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924). Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims the earliest dream sequence was in Edwin S. Porter's \"Life of an American Fireman\" (1903). Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out G.A. Smith's use of a dream sequence in \"Let Me Dream Again\" (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature a dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost.\n\nWalters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to magic lantern shows features \"slipping\" or \"slipper\" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format. Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as Edwin S. Porter's \"Dream of a Rarebit Fiend\" (1906). What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.\n"}

He is principally known as a leading twentieth century authority on Vipassana meditation and an influential leader of the Vipassana movement.\n\nBa Khin was born in Yangon during the British colonial rule in March 1899. He passed the final high school examination, winning a gold medal as well as a college scholarship. Family pressures forced him to discontinue his formal education to start earning money. His first job was with a Burmese newspaper called The Sun, but after some time he began working as an accounts clerk in the office of the Accountant General of Burma. In 1926 he passed the Accounts Service examination, given by the provincial government of India. In 1947, when Burma was separated from India, he was appointed the first Special Office Superintendent. \n\nIn that same year, in January 1937, Ba Khin met a student of Saya Thet Gyi. Thet Gyi was a wealthy farmer and disciple of the renowned master Ledi Sayadaw, who taught him anapana-sati, a form of meditation taught by the Buddha. When Ba Khin tried it, he experienced good concentration, which impressed him so much that he resolved to complete a full course in Vipassana meditation that Thet Gyi offered at a center he had established for that purpose. Accordingly, Ba Khin applied for a ten-day leave of absence and set out for Thet Gyi's teaching center. Ba Khin progressed well during this first ten-day course, and continued his practise during frequent visits to his teacher's center and meetings with Thet Gyi whenever he came to Rangoon.\n\nIn 1941, a seemingly happenstance incident occurred which was to be important in his life. While on government business in upper Burma, he met by chance Webu Sayadaw, a monk who was widely recognized as an arahant. Webu Sayadaw was impressed with Ba Khin's proficiency in meditation, and urged him to teach. The monk was the first person to exhort Ba Khin to start teaching.\n\nOn 4 January 1948, the day Burma gained independence, Ba Khin was appointed first Accountant General of the Union of Burma. \n\nIn 1950 he founded the Vipassana Association of the Accountant General's Office where lay people, mainly employees of that office, could learn Vipassana meditation. In 1952, the International Meditation Centre (I.M.C.) was opened in Rangoon, two miles north of the Shwedagon Pagoda. Here many Burmese and foreign students received instruction in the Dhamma from Ba Khin. He was also active in the planning for the Sixth Buddhist Council known as Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana (Sixth Recitation) which was held in 1954–56 in Yangon. \n\nBa Khin finally retired from his outstanding career in government service in 1967. From that time, until his premature death in 1971 stemming from complications of surgery, he stayed at I.M.C. in Burma, teaching Vipassana.\n\nBa Khin became a notable teacher of vipassanā meditation. After his death, some of his students established meditation centers in his tradition in various countries.\n\nThere are six International Meditation Centres organized by the Burmese Buddhist branch of students in the Ba Khin Tradition. Each of these centres in the West is a direct offshoot of the International Meditation Centre of Rangoon, Burma, which was founded by Ba Khin. These centres are guided by his closest disciple Mya Thwin, known to her followers as Mother Sayama Gyi. \n\nAnother prominent student of Ba Khin is S. N. Goenka. There are over two hundred centres of Vipassana meditation as taught by S. N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin, located in various countries throughout the world.\n\n\nWhen he realized his time was running out, he commissioned the following foreign students and entrusted them with teaching Vipassana in their respective countries.\n\nAuthorized by a letter dated April 23, 1969: \n\n1. Dr Leon Wright, PhD., Professor of Religion, Washington, D.C., U.S.A.\n\n2. Mr. Robert H. Hover, La Mirada, California, U.S.A.\n\n3. Mrs. Ruth Denison , Hollywood, California, U.S.A.

Van Amersfoort, The Hague, The Netherlands.\n\n\n7. Mr. S. N. Goenka, Bombay, India.\n\nIn Burma, the ten members of the Vipassana Research Association assisted Sayagyi in his teaching, and in particular, Mother Sayama Daw Mya Thwin, U Chit Tin, U Tint Yee, U Ba Pho, and U Boon Shain.\n\n\n"}

The regatta has been held annually on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1953.\n\nIt was renamed the Jefferson Dad Vail Regatta in 2019 for new sponsor Thomas Jefferson University, a private university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed in 2017 through the merger of Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University.\n\nIt was renamed the Aberdeen Dad Vail Regatta in 2010 for sponsor Aberdeen Asset Management, a Scottish investment firm whose U.S. operations are headquartered in Center City Philadelphia.\n\nThe purposes of the Dad Vail Rowing Association are: \"to perpetuate the 'Dad' Vail tradition, foster and encourage intercollegiate rowing among colleges new to the sport, and promote schedules for member schools.\"\n\nThe regatta was named after Harry Emerson \"Dad\" Vail, for his years of coaching at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nThe story of the Dad Vail Regatta, and of the Rowing Association, begins with two men, \"Rusty\" Callow, then coach at the University of Pennsylvania, who came up with the idea, and Lev Brett, who made the idea a reality.\n\nCallow originated the idea of promoting competition among colleges struggling to found rowing programs. These included schools too small to hope to ever compete in major races and larger institutions not yet ready for such competition. In order to create competition, Rusty created a trophy as the competition prize, in 1934, which was named in honor of Vail.\n\nSince then, the name \"Dad\" Vail has become one and the same with the race. Vail's passion for rowing helped form the modern-day Dad Vail Regatta and motivate the multitudes of colleges to come compete.\n\nThe first race, before the formation of the Dad Vail Rowing Association, was held in 1934 with \"Rusty\" and the University of Pennsylvania as hosts. Marietta College, coached by Ellis MacDonald won the first leg on the new trophy by finishing second to a Penn sub-varsity boat, which was an added entry. Rutgers, coached by Ned Ten Eyck, was third and Manhattan College, coached by \"Skippy\" Walz was fourth.\n\nThe race in 1935 was at Marietta. With the addition of Rollins College and Wisconsin, the order at the finish of the race was: Rutgers, Penn, Marietta, Wisconsin, Manhattan, and Rollins. There was no race held in 1937. In both 1936 and 1938, only Rutgers and Manhattan competed on the Harlem. Rutgers won both times. In February 1939, a meeting was held and the Dad Vail Rowing Association was formed in order to help promote the race and encourage schools to compete.\n\nThe growth of the regatta is pointed out by the following statistics: in the first association regatta, seven colleges sent seven varsity crews to Red Bank. At Philadelphia in 1961, twenty colleges sent forty crews to compete in varsity, JV, and freshman races. Currently, over a hundred colleges and universities from the United States and Canada compete, making the Dad Vail Regatta the largest collegiate regatta in the United States and bringing thousands of student athletes to Philadelphia.\n\nWomen competed for the first time in 1976.As coxswain for Marietta College's JV heavyweight eight that year, Deborah Patterson was the first woman to win a gold medal at the Dad Vail. \n\nBriefly in late 2009, the Dad Vail Organizing Committee announced that the regatta would be held in Rumson, New Jersey in 2010, citing loss of local sponsors. However, this decision was soon rescinded due to pressure from the City and logistical problems with the Rumson location, and the event returned to Philadelphia for 2010.\n\nThe Dad Vail entered its 75th year in 2013.\n\n\n"}

Derived from axo- (=axon) and -tomy (=surgery). This type of denervation is often used in experimental studies on neuronal physiology and neuronal death or survival as a method to better understand .\n\nAxotomy may cause neuronal cell death, especially in embryonic or neonatal animals, as this is the period in which neurons are dependent on their targets for the supply of survival factors. In mature animals, where survival factors are derived locally or via autocrine loops, axotomy of peripheral neurons and motoneurons can lead to a robust regenerative response without any neuronal death. In both cases, autophagy is observed to markedly increase. Autophagy could either clear the way for neuronal degeneration or it could be a medium for cell destruction.\n\nUpon injury of a peripheral axon, the entire neuron immediately reacts in order to regenerate the axon. This reaction requires an increased metabolic activity and is initiated by chromatolysis. Chromatolysis is characterized as the dissolution of protein-producing structures in the cell body of a neuron and is a term used to characterize apoptosis of neuronal cells. During chromatolysis, the soma and nucleus round and enlarge, the Nissl bodies and Golgi bodies both disintegrate, and the cytocentrum is cleared. In most cases, the axotomy response in peripheral axons ends in cell healing and regeneration, though it may occasionally end in cell death. Regeneration occurs because of microglial hyperplasia and astroglial hypertrophy, activities that are lacking in the central axotomy response.\n\nIn contrast to the peripheral response, the axotomy response in central neurons (neurons in the Central Nervous System) almost always leads to cell death. The mode of cell death is often apoptosis. Central neurons, upon being severed, generally fail to up-regulate the expression of trophic factors, a type of regeneration-associated protein. These trophic factors are responsible for the regulation of neuron vitality and are a critical aspect of neuroprotection. Trophic factors guarantee the survival of neuron synapsing, meaning they essentially maintain the functionality of the neuron. The lack of increased expression of these proteins will ultimately lead to cellular atrophy.\n\nWhen performing neurosurgery, professionals are often required to intentionally sever axons. Laser axotomy is a technique is under development that allows for precise axon severing. Laser axotomy could enable doctors to better understand the downstream effects of a severed axon so that they can develop more effective treatment arms. Being able to precisely sever specific axons will enable researchers to study direct correlation of axons to functionality.\n\nAlthough many times axotomy occurs due to intended surgical treatment, it is also often directly related to one of many pathologies/injuries. The following is a preliminary list of some of the known associated injuries and pathologies.\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a disease that demyelinates the nerves of the central nervous system, leading to deteriorated bodily function. The underlying pathologies are mostly unknown and not understood. It is hypothesized by many that the demyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions leads to axonal transection and ultimately axonal degeneration. This axon death could potentially be the cause of the irreversible effects of multiple sclerosis. Using what is known about the axotomy response, doctors and researchers are looking to implement neuro-protective rehabilitation to patients suffering in the early stages of multiple sclerosis in order to prevent the disease from running its course and causing irreversible disability. These rehabilitations would include the utilization of trophic factors to aid in neuron survival and maintenance of synapsing function.\n\nA traumatic brain injury is defined as a blunt non-missile penetrating or missile injury to the head. It has been shown that the extent of the damage incurred after a head trauma correlates more directly with the amount of deformation incurred by the brain than the amount of stress per area applied to the head. There are two modes of axotomy that can occur as a result of a TBI. Primary axotomy occurs immediately and is characterized as complete mechanical transaction of axons. More often, secondary axotomy occurs, evolving over time and ultimately leading to disconnection. While this type of injury is often irreversible, the axons do occasionally recover. Researchers are currently working towards utilizing this potential for recovery to develop therapies for patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries. These therapies rely on the scientific understanding of the axotomy response. Two mechanisms that aid in the reinnervation process are acute inflammation and the activation of molecules in the extracellular matrix surrounding the synapse. Immediate acute inflammation leads to the removal of the severed axons by activating the local glia. The inflammation response also recruits growth factors that aid in the repopulation of postsynaptic sites. The negative effects of this inflammation may be difficult to detect immediately post injury. Inflammation of the head is often slow to onset after injury, and can lead to a fatal rise in cerebral pressure. A recently discovered and understood cytokine is currently being used to try to treat the axotomy before the rise in pressure occurs. This cytokine, called osteopontin, may be able to aid in axon regeneration by exposing its integrin receptor binding sites. Osteopontin secretion may be able to regulate synaptogenesis and target the necessary neuroglia required for the repair of the axons. A study done by Julie L. Chan proves the functionality of osteopontin in initiating the immune response necessary for synaptic repair and reorganization after injury (axotomy). Though the study effectively proved the functionality of osteopontin in diminishing the intense inflammatory response following a traumatic brain injury, it did not provide evidence of the long-term effects of implanting this as a treatment option. Altering the inflammatory response may unintentional halt the beneficial aspects of inflammation and have devastating effects on the brain's ability to heal itself.\n\n"}

The river is approximately long and passes through or borders the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz. Since one of the headwaters of the Moctezuma River is the Tula River, the Pánuco ultimately drains the Valley of Mexico containing Mexico City.\n\nNear its source, the Pánuco serves as a drainage channel for Mexico City. From there, it becomes the state border between Hidalgo and Querétaro as it moves toward San Luis Potosí. It takes the name \"Río Pánuco\" only upon reaching the state of Veracruz. It empties into the Gulf of Mexico at Tampico and Ciudad Madero, where it forms the border between the states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz. The Tampico Bridge crosses the river near its mouth on the Gulf.\n\nIn total, the Pánuco is more than 500 km in length, though only the last 15 km is navigable for larger ships. According to the \"Atlas of Mexico\", it is the fourth-largest river in Mexico by volume of runoff, and forms the sixth-largest river basin in Mexico by area. The complete watershed of the Pánuco and its tributaries drains portions of Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Guanajuato, Querétaro, Hidalgo, Mexico, Puebla, and Veracruz.\n\nIn 1519, during his cartographic expeditions along the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico, Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda established a settlement on the river, which he named \"Las Palmas\", though it was abandoned after he was killed in battle with indigenous peoples living nearby.\n\nThe Pánuco River basin is rich in fish. There are almost 100 fish species, including a few that were introduced. There are many endemics: six \"Nosferatu\" cichlid species, five \"Tampichthys\" minnows, nine \"northern swordtails\" (genus \"Xiphophorus\"), three \"Gambusia\" species, two \"Ictalurus\" catfish, the bluetail goodeid (\"Ataeniobius toweri\"), dusky splitfin (\"Goodea gracilis\"), relict splitfin (\"Xenoophorus captivus\"), pygmy shiner (\"Notropis tropicus\"), checkered pupfish (\"Cualac tessellatus\"), broadspotted molly (\"Poecilia latipunctata\"), Tamasopo cichlid (\"Herichthys tamasopoensis\"), Calabazas shiner (\"Notropis calabazas\") and fleshylip buffalo (\"Ictiobus labiosus\"). Additionally, a couple of still-undescribed species are known from this river basin. A few of the endemics are seriously threatened.\n\n\n"}

He attended the University of Vienna and the University of Prague before serving as the successor to Count Anton Graf von Wolkenstein-Trostburg as the Austro-Hungarian ambassador to the Russian Empire from 1894 to 1898. He was the 1,204th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria.\n\nHe fell in love with Elisabeth von Gutmann, a widow who had converted to Roman Catholicism from Judaism in 1899, but his brother Johann disapproved of the relationship and refused to consent to it. In 1919, he secretly married Gutmann in Salzberg and remarried her following Johann's death on 22 July 1929. In 1937, Franz founded the Order of Merit of the Principality of Liechtenstein on the anniversary of his marriage.\n\nOn 11 February 1929, Johann II died passing the title of Prince of Liechtenstein to Franz. A few weeks after he took the title 395,360 acres of land belonging to the Liechtenstein family was seized by Czechoslovakia. A delegation of farmers petitioned him to establish a republic in Liechtenstein, but ended their attempts when he stated that he would not give any his money towards the country forcing it to rely solely on taxation.\n\nIn 1937, Prime Minister Josef Hoop admitted that Austrian pretender Otto von Habsburg was living in Liechtenstein Castle as a guest of Franz I in order to be closer to Austria rather than in his previous residence of Steenokkerzeel, Belgium. An extradition treaty was also signed between Liechtenstein and the United States.\n\nHe had no children so his nephew Prince Aloys was heir presumptive, but Aloys removed himself from the line of succession in favor of his son, Franz Joseph, in 1923.\n\nOn 31 March 1938, he made his grandnephew Franz Joseph his regent following the Anschluss of Austria. After making his grandnephew regent he moved to Feldberg, Czechoslovakia and on 25 July, he died while at one of his family's castles, Castle Feldberg, and Franz Joseph formally succeeded him as the Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\nAlthough Franz stated that he had given the regency to Franz Joseph due to his old age it was speculated that he did not wish to remain in control of the principality if Nazi Germany were to invade.\n\n"}
{"id": "1903533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903533", "title": "Basque diaspora", "text": "Basque diaspora\n\nThe Basque diaspora is the name given to describe people of Basque origin living outside their traditional homeland on the borders between Spain and France. Many Basques have left the Basque Country for other parts of the globe for economic and political reasons, with substantial populations in Colombia, Argentina and Chile with those of Basque ancestry in the hundreds of thousands; Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela and Uruguay (an estimated 5,000 to 50,000 descendants), Canada, and the United States.\n\nNotably, the Basque diaspora is sometimes referred to as \"the eighth province\", indirectly referring to the historical seven Basque provinces.\n\nBasque people decided to evacuate children. Children were shipped. The boats were in Bilbao (Santurtzi), and they went to different places such as Britain, Belgium, and other European countries. They also went to America, specifically to Mexico. They went to a camp and organize themselves in tents, but the construction of the camp was for 2,000 people; and 4,000 people arrived but some of the children and teachers went back to Euskal Herria, but others still leave in England.\n\nPeople of Basque descent make up 10% of Argentina's population, and it was a major destination for Basques emigrating from both Spain and France in the 19th and 20th centuries. Basques have left an indelible imprint on Argentine culture and politics, with many place names and surnames, including those of several Presidents. After several generations, a sense of Basque heritage is still strong, maintained through numerous Basque cultural centres in major cities. Argentine sportspeople with Basque surnames have frequently been nicknamed \"El Vasco\".\n\nThe Basques arrived in Chile in the 18th century from their homeland in northern Spain (see Basque Provinces) and parts of southwestern France, as merchants and due to their hard work and entrepreneurship, rose to the top of the social scale and intermarried into the Chilean elites of Castilian descent. This union is the basis of the Chilean elite of today. The Basque settlers also intermarried into the native American population of central Chile in the middle of the colonial period to form the large mestizo population that exists in Chile today; mestizos create modern middle and lower classes; other Basque settlers also intermarried with mestizos of Castilian descent. Thousands of Basque refugees fleeing Spanish Civil War in 1939 also settled and have many descendants in the country and have even intermarried with other Spanish ethnic groups other than Castilians as well as other European ethnic groups. Population estimates of Basque-Chileans range from 10% (1,600,000) to as high as 27% (4,500,000).\n\nMiguel de Unamuno stated that two things could be clearly attributed to the Basques: The Jesuits and the Republic of Chile\n\nColombia was one of early focus of Basque immigration; it is estimated that at least 40% of the Coffee Axis and Antioquia's population have Basque origin (2,800,000 persons). Between 1640 and 1859, 18.9% of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin, making it possible for demographers to predict that nowadays more than half of the country has this ancestry (25,000,000 persons). It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of Antioquia is attributable to the Basque immigration and Basque character traits. The current Spanish dialect in Antioquia, closely observed, has obvious influences from Basque. Basque influence is evident in words such as 'ma' (mother), 'coscorria' (useless, inept) and 'tap' (tap), to name only a few cases. Basque also influenced the pronunciation of the letter 's' apico-alveolar, so in the Antioquia, and the letter \"ll\" (double L) pronounced as a fricative, not to overlook the inclusion of the letter \"a\" before certain initial Rs: instead of , instead of and instead of . Basques began to immigrate regularly and are distributed throughout the country. Due to this presence is that the Colombian department of Antioquia has been considered a major route of the Basque-Navarre immigration, mainly during the colonial era, when hundreds of Basques migrated to be linked to the Spanish colonization companies. It is estimated, for example, for the Department of Antioquia (a region where hundreds of Spaniards arrived, of which a good portion were Basque) some limited aspects of the culture and traditions were brought by Basque settlers. Many point to Basque origins as a way to understand the population's idiosyncrasies. Prominent among these, were two American historians: Everett Hagen and Leonard Kasdan. Hagen looked up the phone in Medellin in 1957 and found that 15% of the surnames were Basques, of Basque origin, finding then that employers in the percentage of surnames was up to 25%, which led it to conclude that the inheritance Basque was very important to explain the increased industrial development of Antioquia in the Colombian context. These ideas were supported by representatives of developmental theories, who sought to justify business growth based on \"the character of social groups.\" There also seems to be some Basque gastronomical influence in the Antioquia region. It is said that the \"arepa\" might have been influenced by the Basque \"talo\".\n\nA notable percentage of Peruvian people have at least one Basque surname, with more than 5 million or 18% of the national population. They trace back their presence to colonial times.\n\nIt is estimated that up to 10% of Uruguay's population has at least one parent with a Basque surname. The first wave of Basque immigrants to Uruguay came from the French side of the Basque country beginning about 1824.\n\nThe first wave of Basque immigration to Venezuela consisted in Conquerors and Missionaries, during the Colonization of Venezuela. The second wave of Basque immigration started on 1939, as a result of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nSee also History of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nAn estimated of 2% of Mexicans have some amount of Basque descent and that community has increased in size from immigration from Spain in the early 20th century. The Spanish Civil War in the 1930s brought over tens of thousands of refugees from the Basque Country to political asylum in Mexico and Latin America.\n\nMost Mexicans of Basque descent are concentrated in the cities of Monterrey, Saltillo, Camargo, and the states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Durango, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Coahuila. The Basques were important in the mining industry, many were ranchers and vaqueros (cowboys), and the rest small shops owners in major cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara and Puebla.\n\nBasque names are found in many places throughout north central and Northeastern Mexico, such as Durango, Victoria, Zuazua and Arramberri - the first province in the north of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico) to be explored and settled by the Spanish, Nueva Vizcaya, comprised the territory of today's states of Chihuahua and Durango.\n\nMany notable Mexicans have been of Basque extraction, such as Agustín de Iturbide, emperor of the First Mexican Empire, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, seventeenth century conquistador, Juan de Oñate, Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa, Vicente Fox, as well as directors and actors: María Félix, Dolores del Río, and Alejandro González Iñárritu.\n\nThere are about 57,000 people of Basque descent living in the United States, according to the 2000 census. This number is highly disputed, however, since before the 1980 census there had never been a federally recognized category for Basques. As a result, Basques were usually categorized as Spanish or French. It is speculated that there are many more Americans of Basque descent who still classify themselves as Spanish, French or Latin American.\n\nThe largest concentration of Basque Americans is in the Boise, Idaho, area, where approximately 15,000 Basque Americans live. Boise is home of the Basque Museum and Cultural Center and hosts a large Basque festival known as Jaialdi every five years. A large majority of the Boise Basque community traces its ancestry to Bizkaia (Vizcaya in Spanish, Biscay in English) in northern Spain.\n\nIn South Texas along the Mexican-Texan border of the Rio Grande Valley, many people are of Basque heritage or have Basque surnames. Along this area are many ranches given to colonial Spanish settlers from Basque Country to New Spain which still exist today. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico, with a number from other parts of Hispanic America.\n\nOther significant Basque populations in the United States are located in Reno, Nevada, and the Central Valley region of California. In Winnemucca, Nevada there is an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who arrived in Nevada in the late 19th century. Reno is home to the nation's only Basque Studies Department at the University of Nevada. There also exists a history of Basque culture in Chino, California. In Chino, there are two annual Basque festivals that celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples, and the surrounding area of San Bernardino County has many Basque descendants.\n\nThere has been a Basque presence in the Americas from the age of Columbus. Basques under the crown of Castile were among the explorers, priests and Conquistadors of the Spanish Empire. Placenames like Durango, Colorado, Trepassey, Biscayne Cove and Biscayne Bay remember their foundations. Basques began to come to English-speaking America during the 1848 California Gold Rush. The first wave of Basques were already part of the diaspora who were living in Chile and Argentina and came when they heard word of the discovery of gold. When the gold rush did not pan out for most Basque immigrants, the majority turned to ranching and sheep-herding in California's Central Valley, and later in northern Nevada and southern Idaho. Many more Basques arrived from the Basque Country upon hearing of the success of their comrades in America.\n\nBasque immigration was effectively cut off by the 1921 National Origins Quota Act. Basque immigration was restored by Nevada Senator McCarran's 1952 immigration act, which allowed a quota of 500 Basques (technically 'Spanish Sheep Herders').\n\nSaint-Pierre et Miquelon is a self-governing territorial overseas collectivity of France, situated in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean near Canada. The name \"Miquelon\" is a Basque form of Michael. The islands were frequented by Basque fisherman prior to Portuguese discovery in 1520. Today, there are many people of Basque descent residing there. The Basque flag appears on the unofficial flag of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, countries like the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Soviet Union (Russia) offered to spare Spanish Republican children from the toil of war.\n\nThey embarked mainly from the Basque ports in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nIn 1950s or 1960s many people went to the west of US during World War II, owing to an economic crisis. But in the US, they started working as sheepherders. When arriving there, their conditions were hard because they were living in a place they have never been before, talking in a different language that they did not learn when they were children. But they were alone, they do not have any family or friends there and they can not talk with nobody. Also, the wind and cold winters were terrible for them. To sum up, they look after the sheep and some of them listen to the radio or play the guitar in their long days not to be bored.\n\nBut since the Soviet Union refused to recognize Francoist Spain, the Spanish children in Russia (mostly born to Basque communists) spent the Second World War and the following decades in the Soviet Union, many of them forming families with Soviet citizens.\n\nSome of them migrated to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution.\nNow the survivors live in Russia as retirees with help from the Spanish governments.\n\nThere is a small, but thriving Basque population based in Asia. Some of the first Christian missionaries in Asia were of Basque descent such as the Jesuit Francis Xavier who died on Sancian Island off the Chinese Coast. The Jesuit Pedro Arrupe was a witness of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in 1945.\n\nBasque immigrants comprised part of the Spanish expatriate population of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. Most of them were soldiers and sailors in the military and navy of the Spanish Empire, merchants, missionaries, and clergy. Families of Basque ancestry, over time, slowly integrated into the Philippine social landscape, developing themselves into some of the most prominent families in the country. Basque descendants in the Philippines today consider themselves to be Filipinos and remain influential in the business and political sectors of the country. They include the Aboitiz family, the Zobel de Ayala family, the Araneta family and political clans like the Zubiri and the Ozámiz families.\n\n\n\n"}

Its main course is long and the Parnaíba River Basin covers . The Parnaíba River rises in the Chapada das Mangabeiras range, and flows northeastward to empty into the Atlantic Ocean, being the longest river entirely located within Brazil's Northeast Region. The middle and upper regions of this river are separated by waterfalls, but is otherwise navigable.\n\nThe fish species richness in the Parnaíba River Basin has traditionally been considered impoverished, but this has been disproven by recent surveys, which have recorded about 140 native species (including several that remain undescribed) and about 40% of these are endemic. One of the basin endemics is the freshwater stingray \"Potamotrygon signata\". More than 70% of the fish species in the basin are members of either Characiformes or Siluriformes. The fauna in the headwaters has not yet been thoroughly surveyed. In addition to the natives, there are seven introduced fish species in the basin.\n\nThe river delta is protected by the Delta do Parnaíba Environmental Protection Area, created in 1996.\nThe river's delta has large stands of mangrove, as well as dunes, beaches, marshes and other habitats. The delta is considered an Important Bird Area and is home to species such as scarlet ibis (\"Eudocimus ruber\") and rufous crab hawk (\"Buteogallus aequinoctialis\").\n\nTwo species of aquatic turtles are endemic to the general region, the Maranhão slider (\"Trachemys adiutrix\") that is found in the delta and the side-necked turtles \"Mesoclemmys perplexa\" found inland, but neither is entirely restricted to the Parnaíba River Basin.\n"}
{"id": "1903561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903561", "title": "Nektar", "text": "Nektar\n\nNektar (German for \"Nectar\") is an English progressive rock band originally based in Germany.\n\nThe band formed in Hamburg, Germany in 1969. The founding members were Englishmen Roye Albrighton on guitars and lead vocals, Allan \"Taff\" Freeman on keyboards, Derek \"Mo\" Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and artists Mick Brockett and Keith Walters on lights and \"special effects\". Though the concept of non-performing bandmembers was not unprecedented (i.e. lyricist Keith Reid in Procol Harum), it was considered unusual that a third of Nektar's lineup had no role in performing or writing their music. Throughout their early existence the band's songwriting was credited to all six members on the album sleeves, but BMI records show that the music was written by the four performing members (Albrighton, Freeman, Moore and Howden). Mick Brockett did however co-write the lyrics with \"Mo\" Moore, and invented or contributed to the original album titles.\n\nThe band's debut album, \"Journey to the Centre of the Eye\" (1971), consisted of a single song running over 40 minutes, with the last 100 seconds of the first side repeated at the beginning of the second side to maintain continuity. It was a concept album, following an astronaut who is given overwhelming knowledge by extraterrestrials, with sonic textures reminiscent of psychedelic rock. The follow-up, \"A Tab in the Ocean\" (1972), drew on more conventional rock and blues influences. Walters had left by the time of their third album, the heavily improvised live-in-the-studio double LP \"...Sounds Like This\" (1973), though the band would continue to use his art in their shows and album designs for a time. A cult following grew for the band, based largely on word of mouth.\n\nNektar's U.S. release, \"Remember the Future\" (1973), propelled the band briefly into mass popularity. A concept album revisiting \"Journey to the Centre of the Eye\"s theme of extraterrestrials granting a human enlightenment, but with a blind boy as the protagonist. It demonstrated a much more melodic sound than previous albums and shot into the Top 20 album charts in the U.S.. The follow-up, \"Down to Earth\" (1974), was another concept album (this time with a circus theme); it also sold well, breaking into the Top 40 album charts and including their only song to chart on the Billboard singles charts, \"Astral Man\". The next album, \"Recycled\" (1975), was stylistically close to bands like Gentle Giant and carried on the band's close connection with progressive rock.\n\nAlbrighton left the band in December 1976, just prior to the studio sessions for Nektar's first major-label release, \"Magic Is a Child\" (1977). The remaining members were joined by guitarist/vocalist Dave Nelson at this point. The album was more eclectic, although with shorter songs and fairly straightforward rhythms. Lyrically the album covered a wide range of subjects from Norse mythology and magic to more down to earth subjects like railroads and truck drivers. In 1978 the band dissolved; however in 1979 Albrighton and Freeman reformed the band with bassist Carmine Rojas and drummer Dave Prater and released a new album, \"Man in the Moon\" (1980), before the band dissolved once again in 1982.\n\nNektar regrouped in 2000 with a line-up consisting of Albrighton, Freeman, and drummer Ray Hardwick; and released a new album titled \"The Prodigal Son\". The following year, the band headlined NEARfest (opposite Steve Hackett) with the full classic line-up including Mo Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and Larry Fast (who played on Recycled) again guesting on synthesizers. In 2003, Moore departed the band and was replaced by new bassist Randy Dembo. Nektar cut one more album, \"Evolution\", before Freeman was replaced by Tom Hughes. Dembo and Hughes left in August 2006, citing communication problems, money issues, personality issues and trust in the management issues. Dembo was briefly replaced by a returning Carmine Rojas, before the band settled on a line-up that consisted of Albrighton, Howden, guitarist Steve Adams, bassist Desha Dunnahoe, and keyboardist Steve Mattern. However, this line up never appeared live on stage in public.\n\nLater in 2006, the band found new management in Roy Clay to replace The Eclectic Records staff, playing \"Prog fests\" around the globe on a part-time basis, and occasionally appearing in some of their old haunts in the New Jersey/New York area. Clay was subsequently released from management duties early 2007 after a dispute over financial matters. The band made an official complaint which exposed further fraudulent acts. Clay was ultimately convicted for fraud, lying and forgery, and was jailed for 2 years and 11 months.\n\nIn mid-2007, a solo tour was undertaken by Albrighton. A full band tour of Europe (primarily Germany) was scheduled by a European-based promoter, but they had to postpone as extra funds were needed to complete the new album, \"Book of Days\", which was not released until the following year, by which time Adams, Dunnahoe, and Mattern had departed the band. \"Book of Days\" featured more of Roye Albrighton's guitar work than previous Nektar albums.\n\nIn late 2007, the band embarked on a tour for which they performed \"Remember the Future\" in its entirety, the line-up now including Klaus Henatsch on keyboards and Peter Pichl on bass. In this formation they toured extensively through Europe in 2008. These concerts resulted in the highly acclaimed live double CD album \"Fortyfied\", which was released in 2009 under Roye's own \"Treacle Music\" label. In 2009, the band also played their first gig in the US again, appearing as headliners at the legendary \"Rites Of Spring\" festival and a week-long tour along the eastcoast.\n\nIn mid 2011, Lux Vibratus joined the band on bass for the Cleopatra records 'Space Rock Invasion Tour' in the U.S. By the time the band came to record the covers album \"A Spoonful of Time\" (2012), bass duties were shared by session musician Jürgen Engler, Mr. Big bassist Billy Sheehan, and Yes member Billy Sherwood, who also served as the album's producer. The Albrighton-Howden-Henatsch-Sherwood line-up recorded and released the album \"Time Machine\". A special post-recording show was put together at the Coach House in South Orange County, California. Returning to Nektar in 2013, Lux Vibratus was on bass for the Cruise To The Edge event, followed by The Virada Cultural Festival in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In June, this line-up went on the road again for a U.S. tour billed as the 'U.K. Legends of Classic Rock'. In January 2014, bassist Tom Fry joined the band for a European tour. On this tour Che Albrighton, Ron's son, made his first appearance as a drummer because Howden had a different engagement. Che had previously worked as tour manager for Nektar on several tours.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Roye Albrighton died after an unspecified illness, at the age of 67.\n\nAfter the death of Roye Albirghton, Klaus Henatsch (Keys), Ron Howden (Drums) and Tom Fry (Bass) decided to move on with the production of a new album with On Stage Records, the label they worked with since 2015. First release under this label the Live CD double album \"Live In Bremen\". Also highly regarded and appreciated because it documents the last tour with Roye Albrighton. Later also released as triple vinyl album. For this new beginning of Nektar Alexander Hoffmeister has been asked to follow the footsteps of his idol and friend Roye Albrighton. After an audition in 2017, Klaus Henatsch, Ron Howden and Tom Fry were willing to continue the tradition of Nektar with Alexander Hoffmeister as new front singer and guitar player.\n\nIn early 2018, Ron Howden (drums) decided to leave the formation to found his own Nektar contribution in the US and approached Derek \"Mo\" Moore about joing his Nektar band. When Moore agreed, former members Randy Dembo (bass and 12-string), Mick Brockett (lights, projections and atmosphere), and Ryche Chlanda (guitar and vocals) were soon signed on. To fill the keyboards slot, Kendall Scott, a friend of Chlanda's was brought aboard. \n\nThese circumstances leaded to the current state, that there are two formations following the name \"Nektar\", one based in Germany (operating under the name New Nektar) and one based in the US. To distance themself from old successes the German formation decided to release their concept album \"Megalomania\" in 2018 using the name \"New Nektar\". To fill the gap Ron Howden has left, they got Che Albrighton, the son of Roye Albrighton, to record the drums for \"Megalomania\" - but when the band played their Megalomania Release Tour in December 2018, he was busy playing with Jamie Lawson, so Norbert \"Panza“ Lehmann joined the band. The US line up retrieved a set of never-formally recorded songs from Chlanda's previous time in the band, and began rehearsals and recordings for a new album to be titled \"The Other Side.\" That album has been released in January 2020 under the name \"Nektar\".\n\nUS:\n\nGermany (also known as New Nektar):\n\n\n"}

Staerkel Planetarium is a planetarium at Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois. It is the second largest planetarium in the state, the largest being the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, and has the first Carl Zeiss M1015 opto-mechanical star projector installed in the western hemisphere. The Staerkel Planetarium provides science education programs and light show entertainment to as many as 40,000 people each year. It has a 50-foot dome, seats 144, and private group and school show reservations can be made beyond the regular public offerings.\n\nPublic shows are every Friday and Saturday evenings. Aside from their regular star shows, the planetarium also hosts a lecture series the first Friday of every month.\n\nThe planetarium is named after Parkland College’s founding president, who led the college for the first 20 years.\n\nThe William M. Staerkel Planetarium at Parkland College, built as part of the college’s cultural center, was planned and designed in the late sixties as part of Phase V in the construction of Parkland College’s campus. The cultural center was divided into two parts, the theatre and the planetarium, which together cost an estimated $4.2 million to build. (News-Gazette)\n\nThe planetarium was named after Parkland College’s founding president, who led the college for the first 20 years of its life, during the dedication on 1987-10-01. The planetarium officially opened to the public on 1987-10-22.\n\nThe Planetarium uses the Zeiss Model M1015 star projector, manufactured by Carl Zeiss, Inc. of Germany. It is the first of its kind to be installed anywhere in the world. It projects 7,600 stars down to magnitude 6, 25 star clusters and nebulae, the sun, moon, and the five planets visible to the human eye. The Zeiss can show the daily motions of the sky, the sun, the moon, and the positions of the stars on almost any given day, as well as various astronomical grids and scales. Auxiliary equipment allows projection of rainbows, clouds, solar and lunar eclipses, rotating galaxies, double star systems, and varied constellations.\n\nIt also consists of its dome, automation, sound and film systems, and projection equipment. The planetarium's projection dome is 50 feet in diameter and at its highest point is 31 feet from the floor of the theater. It consists of perforated aluminum panels that are held together with 7,000 rivets and has approximately 43 million holes in its surface. This allows for acoustic integrity and the placement of effects and speakers behind the dome to be seen or heard throughout the dome.\n\nThe William M. Staerkel Planetarium uses a specialized automation computer, the MC-10 Media Controller, to automate shows using programmable disks. The MC-10 Media Controller can operate either independently or in conjunction with audio tapes. The Staerkel Planetarium's sound system includes a recording studio and a playback system made up of twelve speakers and two sub-bass enclosures located behind the projection dome. The Staerkel Planetarium has the capability of showing 35mm films and can project an image over more than one-third of the dome surface area. And, in addition to the star projector at the center of the theatre, the planetarium uses 57 carousel slide projectors that can show panoramas to cover the entire dome as well as three CRT projectors which allow for the projection of videos and special effects.\n\nThe solar window is a gift given in August 1987 by Dr. and Mrs. William M. Staerkel in memory of their parents and as a tribute to the dedicated Parkland College faculty and staff. The solar window, created by artist Arthur Stern, is an abstract representation of the changing daily path of the sun across the sky, from June (top), when the sun is highest and daylight is longest, to December (bottom), when the sun is lowest and daylight is shortest, and back to June. When the sun shines through the window, embedded prisms split the sunlight into its component colors and cast small rainbow-like patterns called spectra inside the building. These spectral colors are repeated in the colors of the windows. As the rotation of the earth makes the sun appear to travel in its daily arc, the patterns of colors cast by the window and the prisms slowly changes position with the changing position of the sun.\n\n“Cosmic Blink”, the mural gracing the lobby of the William M. Staerkel Planetarium, is the result of an idea that came to Dr. Staerkel in the spring of 1985 and later monetary donations to the Parkland College Foundation. Painted by Billy Morrow Jackson, artist in residence at the University of Illinois, the mural depicts the timelessness of mankind’s quest to understand the universe. Celestial objects, constellation figures invented by our ancestors, space-age mechanical explorers and the images then beamed back to us, and the intellectual giants whose investigations peeled away layers of the unknown all are represented in the mural. Jackson pays homage to the continuing, local nature of the quest through inclusion of Dr. Staerkel and representative Parkland students and faculty.\n\nIn addition to planetarium shows for schools and the community, outreach services are also offered to schools, libraries, and civic groups. Public shows are held on most Friday and Saturday evenings except for holidays, including late night rock-n-roll light shows featuring the planetarium's 3,000 watt sound system.\n\nThe Staerkel Planetarium also offer science lectures on the first Friday of each month during Parkland College's Spring (February, March, and April) and Fall (October, November, and December) semesters, as part of the World of Science Lecture Series.\n\nThe planetarium also occasionally hosts live music performances from avant-garde groups such as Stars of the Lid.\n\n"}

It is a leading worldwide shipping group, using 200 shipping routes between 420 ports in 150 different countries, ranking fourth behind Maersk Line, MSC and COSCO Shipping Lines. Its headquarters are in Marseille, and its North American headquarters are in Norfolk, Virginia, United States.\n\nThe name is an acronym of two predecessor companies, Compagnie Maritime d'Affrètement (CMA) and Compagnie Générale Maritime (CGM), which translate as \"Maritime Freighting Company\" and \"General Maritime Company\".\n\nThe history of CMA CGM can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century, when two major French shipping lines were created, respectively Messageries Maritimes (MM) in 1851 and Compagnie Générale Maritime (CGM) in 1855, soon renamed Compagnie Générale Transatlantique in 1861. Both companies were created partly with the backing of the French State, through the award of mail contracts to various destinations, French colonies and overseas territories as well as foreign countries. After the two World Wars, the two companies became \"State owned corporations of the competitive sector\" (\"Entreprise publique du secteur concurrentiel \"), i.e. companies that, while owned by the State, were run as private for-profit businesses operating in competitive markets. The French government, under President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, progressively merged the two companies between 1974 and 1977 to form Compagnie Générale Maritime, which was still owned by the French State and still run as a competitive business, although sometimes subject to political pressure, for instance on the selection of shipyards to build new ships.\n\nCompagnie Générale Maritime (CGM) operated as such from 1974 to 1996 when it was privatized by the French state under President Jacques Chirac and prime Minister Alain Juppé. During these 22 years it operated freight and container liner services in various global trade lanes, as well as a fleet of dry bulk ships, and a few large oil tankers and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tankers, with headquarters located in Paris western suburbs, first in Paris-La Defense, then in close by Suresnes.\n\nThe CGM liner services, mostly containerized but also operating a significant fleet of \"Con-Ro\" vessels able to load roll-on/roll-off cargoes, were re-structured from the two parent companies' main trade lanes, i.e. Western trade lanes (Americas) for Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (CGT) and Eastern trade lanes (Asia, East Africa, Pacific, plus Eastern South America for Messageries Maritimes (MM). After merger and re-structure, CGM's liner services were managed in four distinct Trade Divisions, North America & Far East (AMNEO, for Amérique du Nord & Extrême Orient) which also managed the bulk and tanker fleets, South America & Caribbean (AMLAT), Pacific & Indian Ocean (PACOI) and Short Sea Trades (Cabotage).\n\nSeparately, Jacques Saadé had created CMA in 1978 as an intra-Mediterranean liner service operator, based in Marseille. In 1996, CGM was privatized and sold to Compagnie Maritime d'Affrètement (CMA) to form CMA CGM.\n\nIn 1998 the combined company purchased Australian National Lines (ANL).\n\nCMA CGM acquired its French rival Delmas based in Le Havre from the Bolloré group in September 2005 for 600 million Euros. The acquisition was completed in early January 5, 2006. The resulting corporation became the third largest container company in the world behind the Danish A.P. Moller-Maersk Group and the Swiss Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A..\n\nOn April 4, 2008, pirates seized the CMA CGM luxury cruise ship \"Le Ponant\" off the coast of Somalia.\n\nCMA CGM and its affiliates have been victimized in various arms-shipping incidents. \n\nAs a result of CMA CGM's involvement in Iranian weapons smuggling, US congressmen have called on CMA CGM to be investigated and urged the US Treasury Department to consider levying sanctions against the shipper. The company has since implemented tighter procedures for accepting shipments bound for Iran, including scanning all containers destined the country. CMA CGM also ceased exporting from Iran in November 2011.\n\nIn 2014, CMA CGM signs the OCEAN THREE agreements. The group strengthens its offer by signing major agreements on the biggest worldwide maritime trades with CSCL and UASC.\n\nIn April 2015, the group acquired a strategic stake in LCL Logistix, a logistics leader in India, via its subsidiary CMA CGM LOG.\n\nIn December 2015, CMA CGM \"Benjamin Franklin\" called at the Port of Los Angeles and thus became the largest vessel ever to call the United States. The container-ship, long and wide, was inaugurated in Port of Long Beach on February 19.\n\nIn July 2016 CMA CGM finalized its acquisition of Singapore-based NOL (Neptune Orient Lines) and its container line APL (American President Lines) after an all-cash offer of US$2.4 billion. The takeover is CMA CGM's largest acquisition and the purchase added 12 percent market share to the CMA CGM group. The Singapore Exchange Securities Trading suspended trading of NOL shares at the end of the offer.\n\nOther maritime activities\nTerminal activities\n\nIntermodal activities and logistics\n\nSupport activities\n\n\nIn 2016, CMA CGM's fleet included:\n\nThis fleet sails 200 maritime services and calls at 420 ports in 160 countries.

The event moved to August a few years after it began and then to June a few years later to avoid the hottest part of summer in Texas. The Festival is held in Downtown San Antonio at the Institute of Texan Cultures on UTSA's HemisFair Park Campus, located at the corner of Bowie Street and Cesar Chavez Boulevard, just off Interstate 37 South.\n\nThe Texas Folklife Festival was modeled after the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, which was first held in Washington, D.C. in 1967. On behalf of the Institute of Texan Cultures (which was built as the Texas Pavilion for HemisFair '68, the 1968 World’s Fair), O.T.

The length of the river is approximately up to the junction with the Grande River, both of which then form the Paraná River, at the point that marks the borders of the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nThe main tributaries of the Paranaíba are the São Marcos, the Corumbá, the Meia Ponte, and the Bois. Major dams on its course are the Barragem de Emborcação, Barragem Itumbiara and Barragem de São Simão. Cachoeira Dourada near Itumbiara is one of the most important hydroelectric power stations in Brazil, providing energy to Goiânia and Brasília.\n\nThe Paranaíba is navigable only in the artificial lake of Ilha Solteira with an extension of 180 km as far as the dam of São Simão.\n\nBecause of the great pressure to use its resources it shows serious environmental problems.\n\nIn addition to the erosion of its banks caused by sand extraction and cutting down of the original forest growth, practically 100% of the towns that form its basin dump their sewage \"in natura\", including the capital of Goiânia, which dumps 95% of its sewage, untreated, directly into the Meia Ponte river, which then flows into the Paranaíba.\n\nThe Paranaíba river is the most important source of the Paraná river, her source lies in the serra (mountains) of Mata da Corda, municipality \"Rio Paranaiba\" (Mato Grosso) at a height of . On the other side of these serra is the source of the Abaete, a tributary of the São Francisco. The confluence of the Paranaíba with the Grande river is situated about from the source of the Paranaíba. At the unison there is a bridge that is also a border point between three states: São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. The Paranaíba river is famous for the rich diamond deposits of her tributaries and her huge hydroelectric potential.\n\nThe Paranaíba may best be studied in three separate parts, the high-, the middle- and the lower Paranaiba.\n\nNB: of each segment the start km-point (and counting down) beginning with 1,070, the length, the slope etc. will be mentioned.\nFrom its headwaters at 1,000 km, a length of 370 km, to km 700, runs with a northerly orientation through the whole extent of the region Minas Gerais at an average height of 760 m, with a slope of 25 cm/km, goes through the town Patos of Minas at a height of 770 m, obtains water from a number of small tributaries that descend from the Magalhães-peak and from the Serra of Barbaça, on the other side of the Serra da Mata da Corda.\n\nAt a height of km 729, at a bridge, she receives the water of a small river, the Verde river, close to the place Contendas (Goias) and bends under the bridge perpendicularly to the southeast and takes the border between Minas and Goias. Between km 700 and 800 the slope is 50 cm/km, running in a valley of average width, with broken strictures between km 730 and 732 and between km 783 and 790. The terrains along the river are rolling smoothly and are poorly cultivated.\n\nFrom km 700 to the reservoir of the Dourada (km 330, with a length of 370 km).\nBetween km 575 and 700 the Paranaíba receives the following tributaries:\nAt km 661, right bank the São Marcos, at km 633, left bank, the Perdizes river, at km 596, right bank, the Bagagem river. In this segment the river has a slope of 1.2 m/km in a region with generally narrow valleys, steeply sloping banks, rising up to 25 and 60 m. The tributaries of this segment cross diamond containing layers in the \"zones of the triangle\" Minas Gerais and Goias.\n\nBetween km 313 and 575 the Paranaíba receives the water of the following tributaries:\nOn the right bank the Verissimo. And the Corumba river (km 436) and the Santa Maria river. And on the right side the Jordao river, the Araguari river (km 469) and the small river Piedade. This stretch has a slope of 50 cm/km and runs through the cities Itumbiara (km 392) and Anhanguera (km 535), both in the territory of Goias, and through the city of Araporã (km 392) in the mine region. In this segment the Itumbiara Dam, situated in the municipality of gemeente Araporã, belonging to the Furnas Centrais Elétricas, operating since 1981 with a power of 2.800MW, being the most power generating hydro-station of the Furnas complex, of the state Minas Gerais and of the Paranaiba river.\n\nThe river presents a relatively wide bed, cultivated for 20% to 50% of the area and at km 400 starts to run on the well known extensive basalt plate of the Paraná River.\n\nFrom the reservoir of the waterfall Dourada up to the unison with the Grande river, with 330 km length.\nBetween km 199 and 330 there is a slope of 33 cm/km. At the limit of this stretch, using the readily available energy, a hydroelectric power station \"of the waterfall Dourado\" was built. This station used to belong to Centrais Elétricas de Goias (CELG), was privatised and now belongs to \"Empresa Endesa Cachoeira\" with a generator of 658,000 kW and a waterfall of 19 m providing energy to CELG. Her reservoir takes up about 78 km of the middle Paranaíba.\nOn the stretch from here to km 195 we find the so-called canal of São Simão (Simon), a narrow canal cut out of the basalt, 23 km long and 35 m deep situated on the border of Minas en Goias. In this stretch we find the São Simão Dam, operating with a power of 2.680MW\nAt 3 km higher up from the bridge in Highway BR-31 the Paranaíba, now 3,500 m wide, rushes into a canal 300 m wide that further downstream is narrowed to scarcely 80 m, creating a high turbulence and speed.\nThe river is navigable from the dam of the island Solteira over a length of 180 km up to the dam of São Simão.\nAs with the Grande river, there are problems increasing the navigability, such as high falls, rapids etc.\nIn any case it would be very interesting to have navigability into the central region of Brazil, including into the federal capital Brazilia.\n\nOne of the greatest ecological losses in Brazil was the disappearance of the Sâo Simão Channel (Canal de São Simão) located on the lower stretch of the river. It was a narrow gorge cut into the basalt, with 23 kilometers length and 35 meters depth, situated on the boundary of the states of Minas and Goiás. The waters of the river, after dividing into two parallel arms, returned to a common bed, forming a corridor of waterfalls. Today this spectacle no longer exists.

This tanager is a resident breeder in South America from eastern Colombia and Venezuela south to Paraguay and central Brazil, Perú and on Trinidad. It is common and conspicuous.\nSilver-beaked tanagers are long and weigh . Adult males are velvety crimson black with a deep crimson throat and breast. The upper mandible of the bill is black, but the enlarged lower mandible is bright silver in appearance. The bill is pointed upwards in display. The female is much duller, with brownish upperparts, reddish brown underparts and a black bill.\n\nThere is considerable plumage variation between the various subspecies, differing mainly in the degree of contrast between the upperparts and the throat and breast.\n\nIt occurs in light woodland and cultivated areas. The bulky cup nest is usually built in a bush, and the normal clutch is two green-blue eggs blotched with black-brown. The female incubates the eggs for 11–12 days before they hatch. The chicks fledge after another 11–12 days.\n\nThese are social birds which eat mainly fruit, but insects are also taken. The silver-beaked tanager is often seen in groups of six to ten, frequently giving a call described as \"cheeng\". Its song is a slow thin \"kick-wick\".\n\nThe silver-beaked tanager was first described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name \"Lanius carbo\".\n\n\n"}

The shorts featured a small animated man, the Teeny Little Super Guy, who resides in a live-action, regular-sized kitchen. He is a small, bald man who wears a yellow hat, a yellow long-sleeved shirt, red pants and black shoes. He also lives attached to a clear plastic cup. Robert W. Morrow described the shorts as including \"parables of childhood conflict and striving.\"\n\n\"Teeny Little Super Guy\" (TLSG) was created by animator Paul Fierlinger as a series of 13 installments for PBS's \"Sesame Street\" in 1982. The first \"Teeny Little Super Guy\" cartoon took two months to create. The series of segments were frequently shown on \"Sesame Street\" for several years. However, in the late 1990s the segments were shown sporadically (eventually not appearing on the show at all from 1997–2000). The segments reappeared briefly on \"Sesame Street\" in 2001 and a short clip (a part of the theme song only) was shown on \"Sesame Street's\" 35th anniversary Special, \"The Street We Live On\". The shorts have not appeared on \"Sesame Street\" since that time.\n\nThe production for \"Teeny Little Super Guy\" started in May 1982 with Paul Fierlinger, Larry Gold, Jim Thurman, Stuart Horn, Patrick McMahon, and Edith Zornow. In August 1982, the production for the shorts developed more seriously into filming the first two shorts. On November 19, 1982, the first short premiered on \"Sesame Street\". Composer Larry Gold wrote the theme song, with lyrics by Stuart Horn. Actor and longtime Sesame Street writer Jim Thurman performed all character voices. The production started filming in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at Paul Fierlinger's house in the Philadelphia suburbs. It ran on \"Sesame Street\" from 1982 until 2001.\n\nToday, one of the Teeny Little Super Guy cups, along with a picture of Fierlinger rotating the cups, is actually inside the public display case at the Brooklyn Public Library along with the other Sesame Street contributors. The display also includes another picture of the character with a yellow balloon. The plaque at the Brooklyn Public Library mentions that \"Teeny Little Super Guy,\" an instant hit two seasons later in 1982, was shot by stop-motion filmmaker Paul Fierlinger, using common household objects. Most of the animation was also done with Tom Sloan along with Ondre Ocenas and Helena Fierlinger. In Episode 4196 of Sesame Street, Luis was inspecting Leela's troubled washing machine. He managed to extract seven items, including the famous Teeny Little Super Guy.\n\nThe filming was done primarily in Paul's house and his studio next door. It was filmed using a 16mm Bolex with an electric motor drive giving a shutter speed of about 1/6 of a second. This allowed for higher f-stops and therefore having the 3D objects to be in better focus. Some of the scenes used early video assist to see how the scene looked on a TV monitor.\n\n\n\n"}

Davenport) as he travels from Kentucky with his girlfriend Estelle across the country, in a patient and introspective 1963 VW Bus, Urge. Divine Right has no idea where he is or where he is going.\n\nD.R. and Estelle take turns sleeping and driving, but D.R.'s constant straddling between waking and sleeping makes the journey as much an inner trip as it is a physical seemingly random trip from Urge to anywhere. The first helper character to be encountered is the Lone Outdoorsman who is a non-moving object in this road-trip story, stuck camping on the same site since years ago, watching TV in his solitude. He is suspicious soul.\n\nThe next helper is the Greek, who is named for his talking. The Greek is on a journey back to Norman, Oklahoma, to destroy the last remaining record of himself, which is an autobiographical Master's thesis. He wants to erase himself and forget his name, and hopes to come closer to Nirvana by doing this. It seems D.R. and the Greek have a lot in common in this quest, but while the Greek is moving toward some goal, D.R. is only running away from home.\n\nNext up is the Native, whom D.R. meets while attending a funeral for his friend Eddie. After this D.R. heads for his sister and tells Estelle he would prefer to see his sister's family without her. He is reluctant to mix his two identities; with Estelle he is D.R. and with his sister he is David Ray. This results in Estelle leaving D.R., and the story, for good. D.R. settles in at his sister Marcella and Doyle's house as if he were born there, and he finds out about a person called Emmit, his chance for salvation.\n\nWhile Marcella's family is at church, D.R. gets his own message from what he perceives as God (Mrs. Godsey) over the phone. She tells him to come home and take care of Emmit. As D.R. crosses the Ohio River, the narration suddenly shifts from Divine Right's journey home to David Ray's weekend trips as a boy from Cincinnati back to the old homeplace. When we change back to Divine Right he is at a crossroads in Kentucky and so is the story: the two D.R.'s are about to converge.\n\nD.R. struggles with his two selves as he gets closer to home. He hallucinates in the back of the van, meets a dragon with \"seven horns\". He perceives himself as the \"monster\". Even so, when he gets to Mrs. Godsey's, he exits the van as David Ray and the two identities finally converged into one after a face off in a nearby coal mine.\n\nD.R. psychically returns home, helping his dead grandmother with the laundry and sharing tea with his Uncle Emmit. D.R. becomes a part of his Uncle Emmit, a part of his family, and a part of the hillside where he will live and where his Uncle Emmit will be buried. Emmit is planted in the ground \"like a seed,\" and D.R. sleeps in Emmit's bed. Emmit is in the box marked \"past,\" and D.R. is in the one marked \"present.\" Everything seems to be in harmony, except for the fact that Estelle is missing. She returns and D.R. marries her, and the story is completed. Divine Right has found himself travelling back to his Appalachian roots.\n\n\"Divine Right's Trip\" was originally printed in installments in \"Whole Earth Catalog\" in 1971.\n\nNorman also wrote the short story collection \"\" in 1977. Both the novel and the short stories share an Appalachian background.\n"}

They are the direct graphic ancestors of the modern Indian and Hindu–Arabic numerals. However, they were conceptually distinct from these later systems, as they were not used as a positional system with a zero. Rather, there were separate numerals for each of the tens (10, 20, 30, etc.). There were also symbols for 100 and 1000 which were combined in ligatures with the units to signify 200, 300, 2000, 3000, etc.\n\nThe source of the first three numerals seems clear: they are collections of 1, 2, and 3 strokes, in Ashoka's era vertical I, II, III like Roman numerals, but soon becoming horizontal like the ancient Han Chinese numerals. In the oldest inscriptions, 4 is a +, reminiscent of the X of neighboring , and perhaps a representation of 4 lines or 4 directions. However, the other unit numerals appear to be arbitrary symbols in even the oldest inscriptions. It is sometimes supposed that they may also have come from collections of strokes, run together in cursive writing in a way similar to that attested in the development of Egyptian hieratic and demotic numerals, but this is not supported by any direct evidence. Likewise, the units for the tens are not obviously related to each other or to the units, although 10, 20, 80, 90 might be based on a circle.\nThe sometimes rather striking graphic similarity they have with the hieratic and demotic Egyptian numerals, while suggestive, is not prima facie evidence of an historical connection, as many cultures have independently recorded numbers as collections of strokes. With a similar writing instrument, the cursive forms of such groups of strokes could easily be broadly similar as well, and this is one of the primary hypotheses for the origin of Brahmi numerals.\n\nAnother possibility is that the numerals were acrophonic, like the Attic numerals, and based on the alphabet. For instance, \"chatur\" 4 early on took a ¥ shape much like the Kharosthi letter \"ch\"; \"panca\" 5 looks remarkably like Kharosthi \"p\"; and so on through \"shat\" 6, \"sapta\" 7, and \"nava\" 9 (Kharosthi \"sh, s, n\"). However, there are problems of timing and lack of records. The full set of numerals is not attested until the 1st-2nd century CE, 400 years after Ashoka. Assertions that either the numerals derive from tallies or that they are alphabetic are, at best, educated guesses.\n\n\n"}

It was last served by Amtrak's daily \"Empire Builder\" (with service from Chicago, Illinois to Seattle, Washington or Portland, Oregon) and, for a time, by the \"North Star\" (with service from Chicago, and later from this station, to Duluth, Minnesota), as well as briefly by the \"North Coast Hiawatha\" (with service from Chicago to Seattle).\n\nIt was of a design developed under the Amtrak Standard Stations Program.\n\nThe Midway station was closed for passenger service on May 7, 2014, with passenger service being moved to the restored Saint Paul Union Depot. For a time after its closure the station was still used to service the \"Empire Builder\" but was later abandoned.\n\nThe Midway station is located at 730 Transfer Road and is named after the Midway area of Saint Paul. Its Amtrak station code was MSP and from 1978 to 2014 it served as the only intercity train station for the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. The station can be easily accessed from I‑94/US‑12/US‑52. The station has an elevation of .\n\nPrior to closing for passenger service, the station offered an indoor waiting area, ticketing service and a Quik-Trak kiosk, restrooms, payphones, baggage assistance, and checked baggage. Free long and short parking was also available. Station hours were from 6:00 am to 11:45 pm daily.\n\nThe station is located next to tracks owned by the Minnesota Commercial Railway and marks a division point between running on the Canadian Pacific Railway (former Milwaukee Road tracks between Chicago and St. Paul) and the BNSF Railway (former Great Northern Railway tracks between Minneapolis and Seattle.) There are two platforms at the station, though the \"Empire Builder\" only used the side platform nearest the station building. There is a second island platform that serves two tracks, but it was rarely used. There are also two spurs behind the main platform which are used for storage and display of historic train cars.\n\nOf the six Minnesota stations served by Amtrak, Midway was the busiest for the Fiscal Year 2013 (its last full year of service), boarding or detraining an average of approximately 321 passengers daily (more than twice the ridership all other Minnesota stations combined).\n\nWhen it opened on March 1, 1978, Midway station took over Amtrak's traffic from the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot, which itself had combined the services of the Minneapolis station and the Saint Paul Union Depot when Amtrak began operating in 1971. The Great Northern Depot was later demolished.\n\nThe primary rail service at this station for most of its existence was the \"Empire Builder\", named to honor Saint Paul-based mogul James J. Hill who constructed the Great Northern Railway, and whose nickname was \"The Empire Builder\". Westbound trains head for Spokane, Washington (and then split before continuing on to either Seattle, Washington or Portland, Oregon) while eastbound trains head for Chicago. There were several intermittent stops between. The next westbound stop for the \"Empire Builder\" was in St. Cloud and the next eastbound stop was in Red Wing, both in Minnesota. About one-eighth of \"Empire Builder\" passengers boarded or arrived at this station.\n\nAfter opening in 1978, the station briefly served the \"North Coast Hiawatha\" until that service ended in 1979. The \"North Coast Hiawatha\" ran three times per week from Chicago to Seattle with the next westbound stop having also been in St. Cloud and the next eastbound stop having also been in Red Wing. The station was also served by the \"North Star\" with services to Chicago and Duluth, with the stop having been in Cambridge, Minnesota and the next southbound stop having been in Red Wing until serviced was truncated from Chicago to this station in 1981. After the \"North Star\" was discontinued in 1985, Amtrak has continued service to Duluth with its Thruway Motorcoach service.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, the Amtrak passenger stop in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis–Saint Paul) moved to the renovated and reopened Saint Paul Union Depot. After a short time of Midway station being closed to the public, but still serving as a service stop for the \"Empire Builder\" the building was abandoned, ending up on St. Paul's vacant property listings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1903594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903594", "title": "Count's Feud", "text": "Count's Feud\n\nThe Count's Feud (), also called the Count's War, was a war of succession that raged in Denmark in 1534–36 and brought about the Reformation in Denmark. In the international context, it was part of the European wars of religion. The Count's Feud takes its name from the Protestant Count Christopher of Oldenburg, who supported the Catholic King Christian II, deposed in 1523, over the election of Christian III, a staunch Protestant who had already implemented Lutheranism as the state religion in Schleswig and Holstein in 1528.\n\nAfter Frederick I's death in 1533, the Jutland nobility proclaimed his son, then Duke Christian of Gottorp, as King under the name Christian III. Meanwhile, Count Christopher (or Christoffer) organized an uprising against the new king, demanding that Christian II be set free. Supported by Lübeck and troops from Oldenburg and Mecklenburg, parts of the Zealand and Skåne nobilities rose up, together with cities such as Copenhagen and Malmø. The violence itself began in 1534, when a privateer captain who had earlier been in Christian II's service, Klemen Andersen, called Skipper Clement, at Count Christoffer's request instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. The headquarters for the revolt came to be in Aalborg. A large number of manors were burned down in northern and western Jutland. On 10 August 1534, Count Christoffer accepted Skåne for Christian II's rule. The month before, Christoffer was heralded as regent on Christian II's behalf by the Zealand Council in Ringsted.\n\nAn army of nobles under the leadership of Niels Brock and Holger Rosenkrantz was defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian III, in the meantime, forced a peace with Lübeck, from which great reinforcements could be freed up to fight against the rebels. Under the leadership of Johan Rantzau, the royal troops pursued the peasants all the way to Aalborg, where the latter, under the leadership of Skipper Clement, had taken refuge behind the city's fortifications.\n\nOn 18 December, Rantzau's troops stormed the city, and it fell. At least 2,000 people are thought to have lost their lives in the storming of the city and in the plundering of the following days. For his part, Skipper Clement, badly wounded, managed to escape, but a few days later was recognized by a peasant in Storvorde east of Aalborg and handed over to Rantzau. Skipper Clement was later sentenced to death by the judicial council in Viborg and executed in 1536.\n\nFortune did not fare well for the rebelling supporters of the Catholic faith, nor for the farmers on the Swedish front. The Swedish King Gustav Vasa sent a Swedish army to the aid of Christian III, which invaded Skåne at Loshult and plundered, burned, and murdered their way throughout the area as it advanced toward the town of Væ. Later, a Swedish army invaded Halland, which was destroyed by fire and sword. Some of the Scanian nobles sided with the Swedes, but Tyge Krabbe in Helsingborg Castle supported Count Christoffer. In January 1535, the Swedes and the army of nobles advanced on Helsingborg. An army consisting of residents of Lübeck and Malmø under Jørgen Kock was entrenched outside of the castle, and in a decisive moment, Tyge Krabbe suddenly had the castle's cannons open fire against its defenders, after which he opened the castle to the Swedes, who set fire to Helsingborg and reduced the town to ashes. With that, Denmark east of the Sound was lost for Count Christoffer.\n\nAfter the victory at Aalborg, Rantzau brought his troops to Funen, and on 11 June 1535, they fought the Battle of Øksnebjerg, where the rest of Count Christoffer's army was decisively defeated. Both Copenhagen and Malmø, however, were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege. With this, the Count's Feud was officially over.\n\nIn the aftermath of the feud, the nobles regrouped and healed the rifts the usual way, namely through inter-marriage. One of the most powerful among the Danish nobility in Skåne at this time was the Bille family, who were tied through blood relations to seven of the eight Catholic bishops of Denmark. The Billes also had six family members on the Council of the Realm and owned castles throughout Denmark and Norway. In order to keep the family's powerful position, in spite of the religious affiliation with the Catholic faith, Claus Bille (of Stockholm Bloodbath fame, second cousin to Gustav Vasa), protected the family by forming a political alliance through marriage with the Brahe family, another powerful Scanian family among the Danish nobility at this time. The Brahe family was one of the first among the nobility to convert to Lutheranism. Claus Bille gave his 18-year-old daughter Beate in marriage to Otte Brahe, and thus became a grandfather in 1546 to the perhaps most famous Scanian of the era, the astronomer Tyge Brahe, better known as Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe's paternal grandfather, whom he was named after, Tyge Brahe of Tosterup in eastern Skåne, was killed 7 September 1523 during the siege of Malmø, fighting for Frederick I. Axel Brahe, the brother of the older Tyge Brahe, served as governor of Scania for a long period, and was one of the first to convert to Lutheranism.\n\nIn contrast, the consequences of the peasant uprising cost all parties dearly. Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles. Moreover, the dissatisfactions of the peasants, which had culminated in the uprising of the Count's Feud, were only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident. Moreover, Christian III's rule, ushered in by this war, saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes.\n\nAn important consequence not sufficiently appreciated by Danes at the time was the introduction of a Swedish army into Skåne. Though in this case the Swedes came at the invitation of a Danish King to help subdue his rebellious subjects and duly handed over to the King the territory which they conquered, it had a clear effect of whetting Swedish appetite to gain the territory for themselves, which was manifested in a long series of subsequent wars culminating with the final Swedish victory and conquest in 1658.\n\n\nThe science fiction novel \"The Corridors of Time\" by Poul Anderson — an American of Danish origin, whose work often includes themes from Danish and Scandinavian history — includes a vivid description of Jutland in the immediate aftermath of the Count's Feud and the continuing struggle by hunted diehard rebels, as seen by a time-traveller from the 20th century.\n"}

It has also been referred to as the \"Figaro/Don Giovanni Fantasy\" and is based on music from Mozart's operas \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni\". Liszt composed the work by the end of 1842 or early 1843, as he performed it at the latest in Berlin on 11 January 1843.\n\nFerruccio Busoni published a much shorter performing version, the \"Fantasy on Two Motives from W. A. Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro, in 1912. Busoni's version, which does not include the music based on \"Don Giovanni\", is often nicknamed the \"Figaro Fantasy\".\n\nLiszt's incomplete manuscript contains no title, no tempo indications, and very few dynamics and articulation marks. The ending is some few bars from complete. Liszt probably tried out an improvised solution in performance, judging by the rather insignificant gaps.\n\nThe Liszt autograph manuscript for the nearly completed work is housed at the Stiftung Weimarer Klassik/Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv, Weimar (shelf mark \"GSA 60/I 45\"). There is no title, date or place of composition, or signature. It consists of 50 unnumbered pages of music. Much of the music is based on two arias from the opera \"The Marriage of Figaro\": Figaro's \"Non più andrai\" (Act I) and Cherubino's \"Voi che sapete\" (Act II). Fifteen pages are devoted to the dance scene from the Act I finale of \"Don Giovanni\".\n\nAt some point the pianist-composer Ferruccio Busoni, who has been described as \"probably the most open and enthusiastic Liszt exponent in the early twentieth century,\" became aware of the unpublished manuscript and prepared a performing version which he first played in 1911 in Berlin. Busoni gave a series of six all-Liszt recitals in mid-October of that year, playing nearly all of the major piano works, and these are the concerts at which his version, the \"Figaro Fantasy\", most likely received its first performance. (Busoni had been on tour in the United States for the first three months of the year, and these were his first piano recitals after returning to Europe in April.)\n\nLater, in the summer of 1912, after the unsuccessful premiere of his Wagnerian-length opera \"Die Brautwahl\" in mid-April and a concert tour through Italy in May, Busoni decided to stay home alone in Berlin to work, while his wife Gerda was in Switzerland on holiday. It was during this period of time that he prepared his version of Liszt's \"Fantasy\" for publication. The manuscript (No. 245 in the Busoni Archive) is dated 11 July 1912. It was published that same year by Breitkopf & Härtel as \"Fantasie über zwei Motive aus W. A. Mozarts \"Die Hochzeit des Figaro [\"Fantasy on two motives from W. A. Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro] (BV B 66).\n\nAs the title suggests, Busoni did not include the music from \"Don Giovanni\", shortening the currently known manuscript of more than 597 bars by 245 bars. The changes also included Busoni's 16-bar completion, as well as 10 additional bars on p. 28, and other elaborations of 5, 1 and 4 bars duration, including expression marks, cadenzas, and ossias. Unfortunately, no editorial notes were included, so there was little or no indication of his alterations or pages omitted. That summer Busoni also arranged and composed music for the \"edizione minore\" of the Fantasia contrappuntistica, the Sonatina Seconda for piano, and incidental music for Frank Wedekind's play \"Franziska\", consisting of sketches for twelve numbers which he never finished. He also shortened and modified the music of \"Die Brautwahl\" for a new production and extensively rearranged the music into a suite for concert performance. There is no mention of, nor was there much time available for a trip to Weimar to re-examine Liszt's manuscript, and it is now clear that his version was never intended to be a scholarly edition of Liszt's piece.\n\nKenneth Hamilton, in his review of Howard's later edition, notes that \"for reasons of personal psychology that we can only guess at, [Busoni] chose to give the impression in his preface that he had expanded, rather than drastically cut, Liszt's manuscript.\" By contrast, the Busoni scholar Larry Sitsky maintains that it is not certain that Liszt intended to perform the music from the two operas together. Instead, since the manuscript pages are unnumbered, it is possible that pages from two separate works were at some point in time placed together in the Weimar holdings. \"Since the transition to and from the \"Don Giovanni\" music is in C major, the 15 pages of manuscript can be played or omitted without any damage to the harmonic scheme. The \"Don Giovanni\" paraphrase begins on a fresh page and at no time are motives from both operas seen on the same page of Liszt's manuscript.\"\n\nIt was not until much later in the twentieth century that anyone compared Busoni's version to the manuscript. In 1991 the Scottish pianist and writer Kenneth Hamilton was the first to publish the results of such a comparison. Later, after learning of Hamilton's findings, the Australian-born pianist, and noted performer of Liszt's music, Leslie Howard, attempted to reconstruct the work as he believed Liszt intended, recording, and in 1997 publishing, the newly-recast work. His intention was to \"publish... the whole of Liszt's \"Fantasy\" with an authenticity of text, supplying and clearly indicating the few bars... which are necessary to render the work performable.\"\n\nAs reconstructed by Howard, the piece includes the music based on the dance scene from the Act I finale of \"Don Giovanni\". The dramatic opening is based on the music from \"Figaro\": a free paraphrase of \"Non più andrai\" followed by an arrangement of \"Voi che sapete\" in A-flat major instead of Mozart's B-flat major. This is the only appearance of Cherubino's music. Figaro's aria returns, initially in its original C major, but is quickly varied both harmonically and pianistically. However, instead of proceeding to Mozart's coda, the aria transitions to the dances from \"Don Giovanni\". In the opera, the dances are a minuet in , a country dance in , and a quick waltz in . Liszt keeps the minuet in F major, and combines it with the country dance in the same key. He does not add the waltz as Mozart does, but treats it separately, eventually combining it with the country dance and, \"excellently,\" a portion of Figaro's aria. A series of modulations follow which combine bits of all four themes. At the final transition, the earlier material from \"Figaro\" is reused alongside the theme from the minuet. This leads to the coda, which finishes Figaro's aria and where the manuscript breaks off just before the likely end of the piece.\n\nHoward has added a transitional passage of three bars from the \"Don Giovanni\" dance music to the final section and the final 15 bars to complete the piece. He has also added expression marks, including \"dynamics, marks of articulation, numbers indicating numerical groupings, m.d. and m.s. marks, pedallings, tempo and other textual directions. The evident deficiencies of the manuscript (time signatures, accidentals, stems, beams, rest signs, fermatas) have been tacitly supplied throughout.\" He uses square brackets to differentiate his additions or suggestions from the original text. The dedication to \"Monsieur de Gericke Conseille de Legation\" appears in the left margin on p. 38 in Howard's reconstruction of the work.\n\nThe selection and juxtaposition of themes from \"Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni\" may have had special significance for Liszt. Leslie Howard describes it as follows:\nBearing in mind George Bernard Shaw's perceptive observations upon Liszt's musical interpretation of the morality of the Don in the \"Don Giovanni Fantasy\", it might be similarly if cautiously suggested that the combination and disposition of the themes in the minuet scene in the present work also adumbrate a moral fable: that the flirtatiousness of Cherubino which may seem harmless enough at the beginning could be leading to the unforgivable behaviour of a Don Giovanni, unless good common sense (See Figaro: \"Non più andrai...\") hinders him from doing so.\nThe \"Figaro Fantasy\", as prepared by Busoni, was performed extensively by himself, his student Egon Petri, and later championed by the youthful Vladimir Horowitz and Grigory Ginsburg. The Russian pianist Emil Gilels made a famous recording of Busoni's version in 1935. However, it has fallen out of the standard pianist repertoire.

According to the chronology developed by Moskov, Sevar would have reigned 721–737. Other chronologies place his reign in 738–754, but cannot be reconciled with the testimony of the \"Namelist\". According to historians such as Steven Runciman and David Marshall Lang, Sevar is the last ruler of the Dulo dynasty, and with him died out the lineage of Attila the Hun.\n\nIt has been suggested that his name is derived from Persian \"Ziwar\" (adornment). Although initially a female name, it could also serve as a component of male names, as suggested by \"Aksĕver\".\n\nIt is possible that his reign was peaceful, because the Byzantine chronicles do not report any events on the Empire’s northern borders from that period.

It is by far the largest island in Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, with an area of . Structurally, it constitutes the southwestern margin of the Academician Ridge. The island measures in length and in width.\n\nThere are two versions regarding the origin of the name of the island and both are derived from the language of the Buryats, the indigenous people of Olkhon. The first is that the island's name comes from the word \"oyhon\" – “woody”, and the second is that it comes from \"olhan\" – “dry”. It is still debated which of the two is the actual origin of the name Olkhon as both words describe the island perfectly. Much of the island is still covered by forests and the amount of precipitation is extremely low – about per year.\n\nOlkhon has a dramatic combination of terrain and is rich in archaeological landmarks. Steep mountains line its eastern shore, and at above sea level, Mount Zhima is the highest point on the island, peaking at above the water level of Lake Baikal. The island is large enough to have its own lakes, and features a combination of taiga, steppe and even a small desert. A deep strait separates the island from the land.\n\nThe island's appearance is a result of millions of years of tectonic movement resulting in the hollowing of the channel between the land (Maloe More Sound and Olkhon Gate Strait) and the block of stone forming the island. The steep slopes of the mountains show the vertical heave of the earth.\nThe population of the island is less than 1,500 and consists mostly of Buryats, the island's aboriginal people.\n\nThere are several settlements and five villages on the island: Yalga, Malomorets, Khuzhir, Kharantsy, and Ulan-Khushin. The village of Khuzhir is the administrative capital of Olkhon, designated as such in April 1987 when the Soviet government issued a comprehensive decree protecting Lake Baikal. Khuzhir is home to about 1,200 residents and boasts a museum of local nature and history.\n\nMost residents are fishermen, farmers, or cattle-ranchers. Due to an increasing number of tourists from all over the world, many residents work in this sector as well, and tourism has become an important part of the economy in Olkhon.\nThe indigenous Buryats, adherents of shamanism, believe the island to be a spiritual place; one of the groups of deities revered in Buryati yellow shamanism is called the \"oikony noyod\", the \"thirteen lords of Olkhon\". On the western coast, close to Khuzhir, is Baikal's most famous landmark, the Shamanka, or Shaman's Rock. Natives believe that Burkhan, a modern religious cult figure of the Altai peoples, lives in the cave in this rock. The rock is one of nine most sacred places in Asia. Olkhon is considered a centre of Kurumchinskay culture of the 6th–10th centuries.\n\nThe museum at Olkhon, named after Revyakin, has exhibits on the nature and ethnography of the island, including pipe-smoking and a samovar collection.\n\nThe island has a long history of human habitation. The original indigenous people were the Kurykans, forefathers of two ethnic groups: the Buryats and the Yakuts.\n\nRussian explorers first visited during the 17th century.\n\nKhuzhir is the main village on Olkhon Island and contains , shops and homestays.\n\nThe National History Museum of Revyakin N. M in Khuzhir contains collections of historical items linked to the life and culture of the people of Olkhon from Neolithic times to the present day. Here, visitors can see various items such as stone arrowheads, badges of Mongolian soldiers, and materials used in cremation rituals, and can learn about life on this island of political exiles in the Soviet era, as well as the unique flora and fauna that can only be found on Olkhon Island.\nThe Revyakin Museum was originally named after a famous geologist, paleontologist, geographer and writer of science fiction, Obruchev. However, it was later named after its founder, and a teacher of geography, N. M. Revyakin.\n\nPeschanaya Village is an abandoned settlement famous for its picturesque sand dunes and the unique appearance of the trees found here – stilted trees with their roots exposed above the sand. The constant winds that blow from the sea towards land move the sand away from the shore and form high sand hills, which are called \"moving sands\", as these sand dunes constantly change location depending on the direction of the wind. This strong wind has also resulted in the exposure of roots of trees near the shore, giving the trees the appearance of a standing person, thus earning them the name \"walking trees\".\nFurthermore, there used to be a gulag fish factory here where prisoners worked during Soviet times. However, after Stalin's death, these prisoners were released, and the factory has been abandoned since the 1950s.\n\nThree Brothers Rock, or Sagaan-Khushun Cape, is one of Baikal's natural monuments and another popular tourist sightseeing spot. It is easily recognised as three big rocks standing in a row overlooking Lake Baikal. According to an old Buryatian legend, there once lived three brothers on Olkhon Island whose father had supernatural powers. Once, their father turned them into eagles but only on the condition that they would not eat dead meat. The brothers were extremely happy with their newly gained freedom as eagles and decided to fly around the island after promising not to eat dead meat. However, when they were flying around the island, they became hungry and found a dead animal. Despite their promises to their father, they ate this dead animal. When their father learned about it, he was furious and turned them into the three rocks that we see today.\n\nKhoboy Cape is the most northern point of Olkhon island. The name comes from an old Buryat word meaning \"fang\" because of its shape, a vertically oriented marble rock, appearing much like a fang.\n\nThe Cape of Khargoy is famous for its remains of an ancient Kurykan's stone wall. The wall is probably one of the best preserved ancient structures of the island and is composed of large stones without the use of any binding materials. The wall is about in length, and in some parts, its height can be as tall as . The Kurykan Wall at Cape Khorgoy was first discovered and described in 1879 by geologist Jan Czerski.\n\nOne of the most important ecological problems of Olkhon Island is the disposal of household waste. At present, the waste is disposed of in large piles in woods near the village of Khuzhir. The dump is unenclosed, and the tipping process is uncontrolled. Moreover, with recent increases in tourism on the island, new sources of hard rubbish have begun to appear.\nAnother ecological concern affecting the island is the illegal felling of timber by local inhabitants. A complicated net of forestry roads in the areas adjacent to Khuzhir leads to woodland areas on the mountain slopes. Timber is brought out of the forest at night time, and the deforestation is taking its toll on the area.\n\n\n\n"}

The Abaco Islands and Eleuthera islands are among the Out Islands.\n\nThe Out Islands are also referred to as the Family Islands, a term adopted in the 1970s. There are approximately 700 Out Islands, of which only a small number are inhabited. \n\n\"A History of the Bahamian People\" notes that even Nassau became a more important port, \"the majority of the Out Islands remained fixed in the age of sail well into the twentieth century.\" A significant number of American Loyalists fleeing from the Revolution migrated to the Bahamas (including the Out Islands), along with their slaves, profoundly influencing the islands' history. Specifically, some 300 white families (owning an estimated 5,000 slaves) fled from East Florida to New Providence; among these, the majority of the whites stayed on New Providence, while two-thirds of the slaves went to the previously undeveloped Out Islands. \"A History of the Bahamian People\" notes that the Out Islands were historically \"a miniature replica of Nassau's socialeconomic system based on race, differential wealth, and economic power\" with some settlements were inhabited entirely by Afro-Bahamians, others by white Bahamians; and others by mixed communities generally dominated by whites. \n\nIn 1980, a Cuban MiG fighter jet attacked a Bahamian patrol boat, the \"HMBS\" Flamingo, in the Out Islands, killing four Bahamian marines. Survivors of the attack came ashore on Ragged Island. The Cuban government maintained that it had mistaken the ship for a pirate vessel. The incident greatly angered Bahamians, and Cuba later issued an apology and reparations.\n\nThe Out Islands are more sparsely inhabited and less economically developed that New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. The most populous of the Out Islands are Abaco, Andros, and Eleuthera; the Out Islands tend to be less populous as one moves southward.\n\nPoverty has historically been high in the Out Islands, given the small size of the islands and the lack of natural resources. In 2013, the Bahamas Department of Statistics reported a poverty rate of 17.16% in the Out Islands, compared to 12.58% in Nassau and 9.69% in Grand Bahama.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, more than 75% of all Bahamians lived in the Out Islands; by the 1970s, two-thirds of all Bahamians lived in Nassau or elsewhere on New Providence Island. This dramatic population shift was related to a lack of stable job market in the Out Islands; only pineapple cultivation and salt-raking provided steady wage jobs, and only on a few islands. Today, tourism is economically significant in the Out Islands; beaches, snorkeling, and scuba diving are the principal tourist draws. A 2017 academic study reported that the relative economic importance of shark diving was greater in the Out Islands than elsewhere in the Bahamas.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1903649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903649", "title": "Betavoltaic device", "text": "Betavoltaic device\n\nBetavoltaic devices, also known as betavoltaic cells, are generators of electric current, in effect a form of battery, which use energy from a radioactive source emitting beta particles (electrons). A common source used is the hydrogen isotope tritium. \nUnlike most nuclear power sources, which use nuclear radiation to generate heat, which then is used to generate electricity (thermoelectric and thermionic sources), betavoltaics use a non-thermal conversion process; converting the electron-hole pairs produced by the ionization trail of beta particles traversing a semiconductor.\n\nBetavoltaic power sources (and the related technology of alphavoltaic power sources) are particularly well-suited to low-power electrical applications where long life of the energy source is needed, such as implantable medical devices or military and space applications.\n\nBetavoltaics were invented in the 1970s. Some pacemakers in the 1970s used betavoltaics based on promethium, but were phased out as cheaper lithium batteries were developed.\n\nEarly semiconducting materials weren't efficient at converting electrons from beta decay into usable current, so higher energy, more expensive—and potentially hazardous—isotopes were used. The more efficient semiconducting materials used today can be paired with relatively benign isotopes such as tritium, which produce less radiation.\n\nThe Betacel was considered the first successfully commercialized betavoltaic battery. The use of diamond-encapsulated carbon-14 to be extracted from nuclear waste was proposed in 2016 as a very long lived betavoltaic source.\n\nIn 2018 a Russian design based on 2-micron thick nickel-63 slabs sandwiched between 10 micron diamond layers was introduced. It produced power output of about 1 microWatt (μW) at a power density of 10 μW/cm. Its energy density was 3.3 kilowatt-hours/kg. The half-life of nickel-63 is 100 years.\n\nThe primary use for betavoltaics is for remote and long-term use, such as spacecraft requiring electrical power for a decade or two. Recent progress has prompted some to suggest using betavoltaics to trickle-charge conventional batteries in consumer devices, such as cell phones and laptop computers. As early as 1973, betavoltaics were suggested for use in long-term medical devices such as pacemakers.\n\nAlthough betavoltaics use a radioactive material as a power source, the beta particles used are low energy and easily stopped by a few millimetres of shielding. With proper device construction (that is, proper shielding and containment), a betavoltaic device would not emit dangerous radiation. Leakage of the enclosed material would engender health risks, just as leakage of the materials in other types of batteries (such as lithium, cadmium and lead) leads to significant health and environmental concerns.\n\nAs radioactive material emits, it slowly decreases in activity (refer to half-life). Thus, over time a betavoltaic device will provide less power. For practical devices, this decrease occurs over a period of many years. For tritium devices, the half-life is 12.32 years. In device design, one must account for what battery characteristics are required at end-of-life, and ensure that the beginning-of-life properties take into account the desired usable lifetime.\n\nLiability connected with environmental laws and human exposure to tritium and its beta decay must also be taken into consideration in risk assessment and product development. Naturally, this increases both time-to-market and the already high cost associated with tritium.\nA 2007 report by the UK government's Health Protection Agency Advisory Group on Ionizing Radiation declared the health risks of tritium exposure to be double those previously set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection located in Sweden.\n\n\n"}

In 1969 it was replaced by the bus, though the tracks remained continuous until March 1994.\n\nThe line started as a horse car street railway, as a branch of the Cambridge Horse Railroad. The branch split at Central Square, Cambridge, and crossed the Charles River on the River Street Bridge into Allston. It continued on through Union Square, and in 1858 was opened to Oak Square in the center of Brighton. The part east of Union Square later became part of the bus route.\n\nThe first electric trolleys in Boston ran between the Allston Carhouse (northeast of Union Square) and Park Square downtown, on tracks running south on Harvard Street, east on Beacon Street, south on Massachusetts Avenue, and east on Boylston Street. These first ran on January 1, 1889, on tracks that had been built for horse cars.\n\nOn June 13, 1896, tracks opened from Union Square east along North Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue to Kenmore Square, merging with the existing tracks on Beacon Street. That year, the western terminal was also extended to just shy of Newton Corner, with Newton Corner service beginning May 21, 1898. On December 9, 1912, the route was extended north to Watertown on tracks that had been used by routes from Cambridge to Newton Corner since 1900. During the early part of the 20th century, the line was also used for light rail freight service.\n\nCars on the line began using the Tremont Street subway to turn around at November 8, 1897, via the Boylston Street Incline at the Public Garden. The Boylston Street subway was opened to an incline in Kenmore Square on October 3, 1914, and the jog on Massachusetts Avenue was eliminated. The Blandford Street Portal, on Commonwealth Avenue west of , opened October 23, 1932, marking the last change in the route of the service. In 1941, the line became the first line in Boston to have primary service with the new PCC streetcars, which replaced the Types 4 and 5 cars then in service.\n\nPrior to 1967, when the current letters were assigned to the Green Line's branches, the Watertown Line was the 69 Watertown–Park Street route. The , the line's current number, was actually assigned to short-turn trips on the \"E\" branch. The line was assigned the letter \"A\" because it was the northernmost branch. Turnback loops existed at Union Square (via Cambridge Street and Harvard Avenue) and Oak Square, as well as the terminal. Additionally, from 1915 to January 15, 1962, a loop existed at Boston University, which until 1953 was the site of Braves Field, for special events along the part of the line concurrent with the \"B\" branch.\n\nThe opening of the Green Line \"D\" branch (Riverside branch) in 1959 caused streetcar lines in Cambridge running out of Harvard Square to be converted to trackless trolley, and the newly freed PCC streetcars were reassigned to the Riverside branch. However, the 1940s-era PCC fleet was aging, and maintaining five different types of PCCs complicated mechanical work. By the late 1960s, wear and tear and a lack of replacements caused a shortage of Green Line streetcars, and the MBTA announced the closure of the A branch on a \"trial\" basis. \n\nThe \"A\" branch was chosen for closure because much of its route consisted of street running sections from Watertown to Packards Corner, and in 1964 there had been objections to keeping the service past Newton Corner. Streetcars last ran on June 20, 1969, with the 57 bus route beginning the next day.\n\nThe legacy tracks remained after 1969, being used for several decades to allow Green Line streetcars to reach the Watertown Carhouse for maintenance. The last use of the line was in 1993, when the fleet of PCC streetcars used for the Ashmont–Mattapan high-speed line was refurbished at the Watertown carhouse. The electrified overhead wire was finally removed in March 1994.\n\nAdditional overhead infrastructure, as well as the tracks themselves, were mainly removed by the end of the summer of 1996 as part of a resurfacing project on North Beacon Street. Remnants of the tracks are still visible today in the Watertown Yard bus terminal (no longer used for railcar maintenance), as well as a short stub track at Packard's Corner, where the \"A\" branch used to diverge from the \"B\" branch. The stub, part of the former outbound track, was used for temporarily storing disabled trains until it was shorted to just a few feet long in the mid 2000s; the switch was not disconnected until 2014.\n\nRestoration of the \"A\" branch was advocated to provide a one-seat ride to downtown Boston from the northern corridor (rather than requiring a transfer at Kenmore), but was ruled too costly and less safe compared to the replacement bus service.\n\nThe 57 Watertown-Kenmore via Newton and Brighton bus was initiated in 1969 as replacement service for the \"A\" branch. The 57 follows the same routing from Watertown Yard to except for the Newton Corner rotary, where inbound buses follow traffic rather than operating in a counterflow lane as streetcars had.\n\nAs a way to make the service more attractive, the MBTA originally had the 57 operate as a limited (boarding-only outbound and dropoff-only inbound) between Packards Corner and Kenmore, with the \"B\" branch providing local service along Commonwealth Avenue. In December 2006 the 57 began making local stops on Commonwealth.\n\nSince free transfers had been previously eliminated by the M.T.A. in October 1961, Watertown riders had to pay a double fare to continue downtown after the bustitution. This continued until January 1, 2007, when a new fare structure added free transfers when using a CharlieCard.\n\nAdditional short turn trips between Oak Square and Kenmore at rush hour were cut in June 1971, and restored for mornings only in 1987. Morning-only Brighton Center - Kenmore trips were operated from September 1999 to June 2013. On September 1, 2008, due to overcrowding on the inner part of the route, the MBTA began operating the 57A Oak Square - Kenmore Station via Commonwealth Avenue short turn of the 57 during weekday rush hours in September 2008. Approximately every other trip operates as a 57A during rush hours; during off-peak hours and weekends all buses run the full-length route.\n\nRoute 57 operates as a busy key bus route, with headways between 10 and 12 minutes at all times (and equal headways on the 57A during peaks). , the 57 and 57A combined were ninth-busiest route on the MBTA system, with 10,094 boardings on an average weekday. Route 57 is based at the Albany Street Bus Facility during weekday rush hours and midday service, and is based at the Cabot Garage for evening, weekend, and holiday service.\n\nOne early-morning trip, intended for MBTA employees but open to the public, continues to on Mondays through Saturdays as 193 Watertown - Haymarket via Kenmore. It was inaugurated along with several other routes by the M.T.A. in September 1960, though they were not listed in public timetables until September 1999.\n\nThe portion of the route west of Brighton Center is also served by four express routes operate to downtown Boston and Copley Square:\n\nThe 501 and 503 serve the same local streets but the 501 operates to downtown Boston and the 503 to Copley Square; the 502 and 504 operate similarly. All four routes enter the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Newton Corner rotary.\n\nExpress bus service from Brighton and Watertown began even while the \"A\" branch was still running. The 61 Watertown/Newton Corner-Downtown Boston via Mass. Turnpike route began in July 1967, with Saturday service added in March 1968. In December 1967, the 61 was renumbered as 4, and a new route 61 running from Oak Square to downtown via Brighton Center and Union Square, Boston and the Turnpike was initiated. In September 1968, the 61 was changed to originate at Brighton Center, from where it ran through Oak Square and entered the Turnpike at Newton Corner. Route 62 Watertown-Copley was started at the same time.\n\nIn June 1970, the routes were renumbered from 4, 61, and 62 to 304, 301, and 302 to reflect their express routings. (The 300-series numbers had been used by ex-Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway bus routes in Lawrence, briefly under MBTA control, in 1968). In March 1974, route 301 buses operating opposite the peak direction began using the pre-1968 routing on Cambridge Street. Inbound morning buses reverted to the Newton Corner routing in June 1974, but outbound afternoon buses continued to travel via Union Square. Some afternoon buses switched back to the Cambridge Street route in September 1976 and September 1978.\n\nAll three routes had a number of minor changes to their downtown and Copley Square routings in the late 1970s and 1980s. Midday and Saturday service on the 302 began in January 1983; in December 1989, the midday and Saturday buses added a Copley Square stop as route 304 Watertown-Downtown via Copley. In September 1996, three routes were renumbered as the 501, 502, and 504.\n\nIn January 2005, the 503 Brighton Center–Copley Square route was inaugurated. Inbound afternoon trips began operating via Cambridge Street in March 2014.\n\n"}

The Roman site, two kilometers distant, was a posting station on the Via Cassia; some ruins of walls and paving at S. Maria di Forcassi still mark the Roman Forum Cassii. The site was depopulated in the later Empire, when a smaller population retreated to the present strategic position commanding the valley, where it remained exposed to attack, in spite of the imposing walls that encircled it.\n\nThe little fortress had been incorporated into the Papal States from their historic beginnings with the Lombard king Liutprand's Donation of Sutri (728) to Pope Gregory II, but the lords of Viterbo held it from 1110 to 1134. By 1145, Pope Eugene III was installed at Vetralla, safely removed from the violence and party strife of Rome; from here he issued his bull \"Quantum praedecessores\", calling for the Second Crusade.\n\nThe territory was given extensive woodlands by Pope Innocent III in 1206, which brought it into fierce contention with the lords of Viterbo who coveted the land.

The main towns on the island are Baranusa and Kabir. Administratively, the island is part of the Alor Regency.\n\nThe island consists of two distinct geographic zones. The eastern zone is dominated by a range of verdant hills which drop steeply to the coast of the Alor Strait. The western zone is relatively flat, consisting of a plain which gently slopes to the west from Mount Sirung, an active volcano. The western zone is characteristically drier and much less densely populated than the eastern zone. Owing to its relatively low elevation, the entire island is drier than neighboring Alor. The dry season is long, interspersed with heavy rainfall during the rainy season, which peaks during January and February.\nThe earliest written reference to Pantar is in the fourteenth-century Javanese poem Nagarakretagama, which describes the power and extent of the empire ruled by the fourth king of Majapahit, Hayam Wuruk. Pantar is referred to with the term 'Galiao', which is known in the Alor archipelago. The precise location of the Majapahit dependency within Pantar is a subject of discussion.\n\nThe economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and fishing. The most common crops are rice, corn, and cassava. Crops are harvested annually in April and stored for consumption throughout the dry season. Excess production is sometimes traded for fish or to help support school children studying in the district capital of Kalabahi. Recently, commercial production of seaweed has been promoted along the north coast. A limited craft industry focused on ikat weaving is centered in Baranusa. Tourism remains underdeveloped, though a small dive resort was recently established on the northeast coast.\nAccess to the island is by water only; there is no airstrip on Pantar. Small wooden power boats ply the route between Alor and Pantar daily, serving numerous communities. The state-run ferry serves Baranusa weekly between Kalabahi (Alor) and Larantuka (Flores).\n\nPantar is part of Alor Regency, comprising five districts (\"kecamatan\"), and has 39,896 residents at the 2010 Census. Within this administration lie some small islets to the west.\n\nAt least eight different languages are spoken on Pantar. These include at least five (dependent on classification) Papuan languages belonging to the Alor–Pantar family (Western Pantar, Sar, Blagar, Nedebang, and Kaera) as well as the Austronesian language Alorese. A small community of Bajau speakers is located north of Kabir. Local varieties of Malay and more standardized Indonesian are used as languages of wider communication.\n\n\n"}

The genus \"Habia\" was long placed with the tanagers (Thraupidae), but it is actually closer to the cardinals (Cardinalidae). Consequently, it can be argued that referring to the members of this genus as \"ant-tanagers\" is misleading, but no other common name has gained usage.\n\nRed-crowned ant tanagers are long and weigh (male) or (female). Adult males are dull reddish brown with a brighter red throat and breast. The black-bordered scarlet crown stripe is raised when the bird is excited. The female is yellowish brown with a yellow throat and yellow-buff crown stripe.\n\nThe Red-crowned ant tanager is a shy but noisy bird. Its call is a rattle followed by a musical \"pee-pee-pee\".\n\nThis bird is a resident breeder from Mexico south to Paraguay and northern Argentina, and on Trinidad. Common in its wide range, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN.\n\nIt preferentially occurs in the middle stratum of the forest as well as undergrowth rich in ferns, shrubs and herbs. These birds are found in pairs or family groups. They eat mainly arthropods, but berries are also taken. In Central America and Trinidad they frequently attend army ant columns, and in the lowland forests of southeastern Brazil they may be a nuclear species of understory mixed-species feeding flocks – though further uphill, e.g. in the Serra de Paranapiacaba, they seem to join such flocks only rarely and prefer to follow the ants on their own. They also follow South American coatis (\"Nasua nasua\") on their feeding excursions, namely in the dry season. In both cases, they are commensales, snatching invertebrate prey startled by the ants or coatis.\n\nThe shallow cup nest is usually built in a sapling or tree fern near a stream, and the normal clutch is two brown-blotched white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13 days prior to hatching, with about ten days more before the chicks fledge.\n\n\n"}

He is best remembered as the heroic commander of the Polish cavalry charge at the Battle of Somosierra. \n\nJan Leon Hipolit Kozietulski was born 4 July 1781 in Skierniewice in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. A friend of Wincenty Krasiński, Kozietulski joined the Warsaw Honour Guard, with which he took part in the Battle of Pułtusk and the Battle of Preussisch Eylau. A distinguished cavalryman, in April 1807 he became the commanding officer of the 3rd Squadron of the Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard, commanded by Krasiński.

The document is very poorly preserved and has suffered considerable damage to the page edges, resulting in the loss of some of the text. The codex largely relates to a cycle of thirteen 20-year \"kʼatuns\" and includes details of Maya astronomical signs.\n\nThe \"Paris Codex\" is generally considered to have been painted in western Yucatán, probably at Mayapan. It has been tentatively dated to around 1450, in the Late Postclassic period (AD 1200–1525). More recently an earlier date of 1185 has been suggested, placing the document in the Early Postclassic (AD 900-1200). However, the astronomical and calendrical information within the codex are consistent with a Classic period cycle from AD 731 to 987 indicating that the codex may be a copy of a much earlier document.\n\nThe \"Paris Codex\" was acquired by the Bibliothèque Royale of Paris in 1832 and is currently held at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris, in the Département des Manuscrits, catalogued as Mexicain 386.\n\nThe codex consists of a strip measuring long by high, folded into 11 sheets painted on both sides, forming 22 pages total. An additional sheet is believed to have once existed, but became lost by the 19th century. The \"Paris Codex\" is very poorly preserved, comprising a number of fragments; the lime plaster coating of the codex is badly eroded at the edges, resulting in the destruction of its hieroglyphs and images except in the center of its pages.\n\nThe content of the codex is mainly ritual in nature, and one side of the codex contains the patron deities and associated rituals for a cycle of thirteen \"kʼatuns\" (a 20-year Maya calendrical cycle). One fragment contains animals that represent astronomical signs along the ecliptic including a scorpion and a peccary; fragments of this Maya \"zodiac\" are depicted on two pages of the codex. Some pages of the codex are marked with annotations made with Latin characters.\n\nOn one side of the codex the general format of each page largely follows the same arrangement, with a standing figure on the left hand side and a seated figure on the right hand side. Each page also contains the \"ajaw\" day glyph combined with a numerical coefficient, in each case representing a date marking the final day of a calendrical cycle. In spite of the poor state of preservation of the document, enough text has survived to demonstrate that in the case of the \"Paris Codex\", the main series of dates correspond to \"kʼatun\"-endings, allowing for the reconstruction of some of the lost date glyphs in the text. The seated figures are each associated with a sidereal glyph indicating that they represent the ruling deity of each \"kʼatun\".\n\nThe reverse of the codex is more varied in nature and includes a section dedicated to a calendrical cycle ruled by Chaac, the god of rain. A set of two pages illustrates the days of the \"tzolkʼin\" 260-day cycle that correspond to the beginning of the solar year over a period of 52 years (a cycle of the Calendar Round). The final two pages of the codex depict a series of thirteen animals that represent the so-called \"zodiac\".\n\nIn common with the other two generally accepted Maya codices (the \"Dresden Codex\" and the \"Madrid Codex\"), the document is likely to have been created in Yucatán; English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson thought it likely that the \"Paris Codex\" was painted in western Yucatán and dated to between AD 1250 and 1450. Bruce Love noted the similarities between a scene on page 11 of the codex and Stela 1 at Mayapan; based on this he proposed that the codex was produced in Mayapan around 1450. However, further analysis of the stela in question suggests an earlier date of 1185 indicating that the calendrical information may refer to an earlier \"kʼatun\" cycle than the one suggested by Love. The astronomical and calendrical information within the \"Paris Codex\" are consistent with a Classic period cycle from AD 731 to 987 indicating that the codex may be a copy of a much earlier document.\n\nThe \"Paris Codex\" came to light in 1859 when Léon de Rosny found it in a basket of old papers in the corner of a chimney in the Bibliothèque Impériale in Paris. The codex had apparently been examined some twenty-five years earlier by scholars and had been catalogued but it is not known how the document found its way to Paris. The document was found with a piece of paper attributing it to the collection of colonial Maya documents assembled by Juan Pío Pérez.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1903678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903678", "title": "Tom Brookens", "text": "Tom Brookens\n\nThomas Dale Brookens (born August 10, 1953) is an American former professional baseball third baseman. He played for the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians of the Major League Baseball (MLB). Brookens was on the Tigers coaching staff from 2009 to 2013, serving as first base coach and later third base coach. He was replaced as third base coach prior to the 2014 season by Dave Clark.\n\nOn January 9, 1975, Brookens was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (fourth pick overall) of the 1975 MLB draft. In 12 MLB seasons, Brookens played 1,065 games at third base, 162 games at second base, and 119 games at shortstop. Tigers radio announcer Ernie Harwell nicknamed Brookens \"the Pennsylvania Poker\", a play on the song \"Pennsylvania Polka\".\n\nBrookens batted .246 in his 12-year career, with 71 home runs and 431 runs batted in (RBIs) in 1,336 games. His range factor (putouts and assists per game) was well above league average. He did lead American League (AL) third basemen in errors twice, in 1980 and 1985, but that was largely because he was getting to so many more grounders than other fielders; his range factor, which measures the number of plays a fielder makes, was consistently above league average. Brookens also has the dubious honor of sharing (with 21 others) the AL record for the most errors in a game by a third baseman, four, on September 6, 1980.\n\nTraditionally an infielder, Brookens found himself behind the plate in a game against the Texas Rangers on July 20, 1985. With regular catcher Lance Parrish hurt and Bob Melvin and Marty Castillo removed from the game in favor of pinch-hitters, Brookens (who had never caught a pro game before, even in the minors) filled the role and wound up catching five innings (11th through the 15th) before Detroit finally won the game.\n\nOn August 20, 1980, Brookens went 5-for-5 with a triple and a home run, and also started a triple play in an 8–6 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nOn September 18, 1984, Brookens hit an eighth inning solo home run into the left field seats at Tiger Stadium off of Milwaukee Brewers lefty Mike Caldwell on a 3-2 fastball. This was the clinching game leading the Tiger's toward their 1984 World Championship.\n\nBesides, Brookens played winter baseball with the Leones del Caracas club of the Venezuelan League during the 1977–1979 seasons.\n\nHe won a World Series ring with the Tigers in 1984.\n\nBrookens in 2005 and 2006 was the manager of the Class A New York–Penn League Oneonta Tigers in the Detroit Tigers minor league system. In 2007, Brookens was hired to lead the West Michigan Whitecaps which won the championship of the Class A – Midwest League that year. After winning a championship with the Whitecaps, the Tigers promoted Brookens again in 2008, this time to the Erie SeaWolves, their Class AA – Eastern League affiliate.\n\nOn November 9, 2009 the Tigers hired Brookens as their new first base coach. The move reunited Brookens with Tigers manager Jim Leyland, who had managed Brookens in the minor leagues in the 1970s. In 2013, Brookens was moved across the diamond to serve as the Tigers third base coach; he was mentioned as a possible future manager of the club when Leyland retired, but former catcher Brad Ausmus was named Leyland's replacement.\n\nLeyland selected Brookens to serve as bench coach for Team USA during the 2017 World Baseball Classic, coaching on a staff that included pitching coach Jeff Jones (who coached alongside Brookens with the Tigers from 2009 to 2013) and first base coach Alan Trammell, as teammate of Brookens from 1979 to 1988.\n\nBrookens' twin brother Tim was also drafted in 1975 by the Texas Rangers; he was later traded to the Tigers organization, but never made the majors. In spring training, Tim and Tom would sometimes switch identities, even suiting up in each other's uniforms; Tim is believed to have played at least one exhibition game disguised as Tom. Their cousin, Ike Brookens, pitched for the Tigers in 1975, while Ike's son Casey Brookens also played in the minors in the 1990s before retiring to become a high school coach in Pennsylvania.\n\n, or Baseball Gauge, or Retrosheet\n"}

The stadium opened in 1987, and its open concourse is considered the template for many later minor league ball parks built in the 1990s. It has a capacity of 5,000 spectators.\n\nThe park is named for Stan Coveleski, the hall of fame pitcher who once lived in South Bend. It is colloquially known as \"The Cove\".\n\nCoveleski Stadium is located on South Street in downtown South Bend.\n\nStanley Coveleski Regional Stadium was built in 1987 for $11 million under the leadership of then-Mayor Roger O. Parent. The facility is owned by the City of South Bend and managed by the South Bend Parks & Recreation Department. Stanley Coveleski was a Hall of Fame pitcher who settled in South Bend after his successful baseball career came to an end in 1929. The stadium is now affectionately known as \"The Cove\". The 5,000-seat stadium is worth an estimated $35 million to $40 million today.\n\nThe stadium is home to the South Bend Cubs, a Class A minor league baseball team affiliated with the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs, for many years known as the \"'Silver Hawks\"', which play in the Midwest League, were originally named in homage to the Studebaker Silver Hawk, once made in South Bend. Originally affiliated with the Chicago White Sox, the team switched to the Diamondbacks in 1997 and to the Cubs for the 2015 season.\n\nCalled \"the grandfather of the modern ballpark\" by BallParkReviews.com, Coveleski Stadium provided a design template for a move in recent years to bring ballparks back into City downtowns. HOK Sport Inc. (now Populous), original architect of Coveleski Stadium, also designed Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and Cleveland's Progressive Field.\n\nOn July 4, 1987, the stadium held a \"Homerun Derby\" to see who could \"make history\" by hitting the first home run out of the brand new park. Norm Bogunia, a 1985 graduate of South Bend's Washington High School and former baseball player there, was the first to hit a home run. He was joined by five other people who also hit home runs that day. LaSalle High School baseball coach Scott Sill ran the pitching machine. Two days later, on July 6, 1987, Joel Reinebold hit the first home run at the stadium during a regular game. A plaque hangs in the stadium with all the names of those who hit home runs.\nIn 2007, as Coveleski Regional Stadium celebrated its 20th anniversary, the City of South Bend began a redevelopment plan for the neighborhood surrounding the ballpark prompted, in part, by the relocation of the Gates automotive dealership to Erskine Commons on the city's south side. The City acquired nearly 15 contiguous acres of property surrounding the park as part of a strategy to encourage new mixed-use development near the stadium and enhance its connection with the core of downtown.\n\nIn March 2017, construction began of a $22 million apartment complex, The Ivy at Berlin Place. The four four-story buildings will house 121 one and two-bedroom apartments overlooking the ballpark. Construction is expected to be completed by opening day of 2018.\n\nOn September 5, 2013, it was announced that the stadium would be renamed Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium as a result of a new partnership with Four Winds Casinos.\n\nThe 1901 synagogue building of the Sons of Israel Synagogue is now used as the South Bend Cubs' gift shop. During the off-season, it is available to be used for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other events. It also hosts a yearly town ball in July. \n\nThe restoration and imaginative reuse of a historic house of worship is regarded as part of Berlin's creative approach to enhancing fan experience, an approach that has included upgrading every part of the experience of visiting the ballpark, from food, to seating, to the ease of using the parking lot.\n\n"}
{"id": "1903699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903699", "title": "Terek Cossacks", "text": "Terek Cossacks\n\nThe Terek Cossack Host (, \"Terskoye kazach'ye voysko\") was a Cossack host created in 1577 from free Cossacks who resettled from the Volga to the Terek River. The local aboriginal Terek Cossacks joined this Cossack host later. In 1792 it was included in the Caucasus Line Cossack Host and separated from it again in 1860, with the capital of Vladikavkaz. In 1916 the population of the Host was 255,000 within an area of 1.9 million desyatinas.\n\nMany of the early members of the Terek Cossacks were Ossetians.\n\nIt is unclear how the first Cossack community appeared on the Terek. One theory is that they were descendants of the Khazar state and of the Tmutarakan Principality, as there are records indicating that Mstislav of Tmutarakan in the Battle of Listveno in 1023 had Cossacks on his side when he destroyed the army of Yaroslav the Wise. This would mean the Slavic peoples of the Caucasus are native to the region having settled there much earlier.(?) But later Terek Cossacks assimilated the first Terek Cossacks and introduced their own new agriculture.\n\nThe earliest known records of Slavic settlements on the lower Terek River date to 1520 when the Ryazan Principality was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and a lone group left and settled in the natural haven of the Terek River (modern northern Chechnya). The early settlement was located at the mouth of the Aktash River. This formed the oldest Cossack group, the Greben Cossacks (Гребенские казаки \"Grebenskiye Kazaki\") who settled on both banks of the river.\n\nIn 1559–71 the Tsardom of Russia, in the course of several campaigns, built several fortifications, during which the first Terka was built, later taken over by the still independent Cossacks. In 1577, after the Volga Cossacks were defeated by the strelets Ivan Murashkin, many scattered, some of whom settled in the Terek basin and Voevoda Novosiltsev built the second Terka on the Terek, marking the start of the Terek Cossacks. In 1584 this Terka was again taken over by Cossacks, some of whom were recruited by the Georgian king Simon I of Kartli.\n\nIn a separate story, an ataman of the Don Cossack Host named Andrei Shadrin led a band of three Cossack sotnias to the Kumyk lands, founding a frontier town called 'Tersky' (location uncertain). This may have been partially motivated by his tense relations with Yermak Timofeyevich. He subsequently founded Andreyevo (the modern Endirey), which was said to be named for him.\n\nIn the late 16th century several campaigns by the Terek Cossacks were carried out against the Ottoman Empire (Temryuk) which led the Sultan to complain to Ivan the Terrible. In 1589 the first outpost on the Sunzha was built and a permanent Terka, later known as Tersky Gorodok, was built on the lower Terek.\n\nDuring the Time of Troubles in 1606 four thousand Terek Cossacks left for the Volga to support their own candidate for the Tsar, Ileyka Muromets. By 1614 the Rowers supported the new Romanov monarch and aided him in quelling the unrest in Astrakhan. In 1633 they destroyed the remnants of the Nogay Horde and a decade later aided the Don Cossacks against the Crimean Khanate in 1646. By the mid 17th century the Cossacks again expanded into the Sunzha where they built a new outpost in 1651. Two years later the outpost withstood a hailing attack by Kumyks and Dagestanis. Though the battle ensured the Tsar's respect, it was advised that the Cossacks pull down the outpost. In the 1670s the Terek Cossacks helped to defeat Stenka Razin in Astrakhan.\n\nIn 1680 after the Raskol in the Russian Orthodox Church reached the Don Cossacks, a number of Old Believers left the Don River and settled first on the Kuma and later on the Agrakhan. After the aid of the Terek and Rowing Cossacks to the Don Cossacks during the Azov Campaigns in 1695, the Ottoman Empire retaliated against the Terek Cossacks and in 1707 most of their outposts were destroyed on the right bank of the Terek.\n\nIn 1711 Graf Apraskin re-settled all of the Rowing Cossacks on the left bank of the Terek River, this move was met with resentment, and during the entire 18th century the Terek Cossacks would still inhabit the left bank and use the rich vineyards and lands right up until 1799. Also in 1720 the Rowers and Tereks were fully incorporated into the Russian Empire and during the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723), the Cossacks aided Peter I of Russia in his conquest of the eastern Dagestan and the capture of Derbent. During the campaign the 1000 re-settled Don Cossacks on the Agrakhan and the Sulak formed the Agrakhan Cossack Host (\"Аграханское Казачье Войско\"), which was united with the Terek Cossacks. In 1735 by a new agreement with Persia the Sulak line was abandoned, and Agrakhan Cossacks were re-settled on the lower Terek Delta, and the fort of Kizlyar was founded.\n\nThus in 1735 three hosts were formed: Grebenskoye (\"Гребенское\" Rowing) from the descendants of the earliest Cossacks, Tersko-Semeynoye (\"Терско-Семейное\" Terek-Family) from the re-settled Agrakhan Cossacks up to Kizlyar, and Tersko-Kizlyarskoye (\"Терско-Кизлярское\" Terek-Kizlyar) from the Agrakhan Cossacks as well as Armenians and Georgians. When the Kalmyks arrived in the northwestern Caspian a combined campaign was waged against Temryuk during the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739), where the Terek Cossacks were led by Atamans Auka and Petrov.\n\nIn 1736 and again in 1765 the right bank of the Terek, still nominally Cossack property, was offered to Chechens who wanted to adopt Russian patronage and re-settle there (noting that historically, the lands immediately north of the Terek river were indeed Chechen before the Mongol invasion and even to a degree after it, and the Chechen highlands were dependent on their agricultural production). By the latter half of the 18th century, relations between the Cossacks and the mountain people began to sour. In 1765 the outpost of Mozdok was founded, which became an immediate target for Kabardins who attacked the Terek line and Kizlyar. In 1771 Yemelyan Pugachev arrived in Terek, and, to show loyalty, Ataman Tatarintsev arrested him. Pugachev fled and the Pugachev Rebellion in 1772–1774 gained no support on the Terek.\n\nThe Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) and the resulting Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca gave Russia the pretext under which they could begin their expansion into the Caucasus, marking the start of the century-long Caucasus War. In 1769–1770 almost half of the Volga Cossacks were re-settled around Mozdok. In 1776 further settlers arrived including more of the Volga Cossacks (the remaining Cossacks on the lower Volga were separated into the Astrakhan Cossacks Host) and the Khopyor Cossacks from the eastern Don territory. These formed the Azov-Mozdok defence line. Major foreposts for Russian expansion into the central Caucasus were founded by the re-settlers including: Giorgiyevsk in 1777 by the Khopyor regiment, and Vladikavkaz in 1784.\n\nDuring this early phase several high-profile battles took place. In June 1774 Devlet-Girey sent a massive Kabardin Army against the Terek Cossacks, on 10-11 of June the stanitsa of Naurskaya was heroically defended against the invaders and in 1785 Kizlyar was defended against Sheikh Mansur. In 1788–91 the Terek Cossacks took part in three campaigns which took them to the Circassian port of Anapa in western Caucasus. The major gap in the western section of the line of defense was solved in 1792 when the Black Sea Cossacks were re-settled there.\n\nThe next three decades brought severe difficulties for the Russian effort in the Caucasus. After the joining of Georgia to Russia in 1801 and the subsequent Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), the Terek Cossacks spared some men and took part in combat under Yerevan, but on the whole most of them were in constant defence of their home lines. All this changed when in 1816 General Yermolov took command of the Caucasus army. Having by now secured major strategic footholds in most of the North Caucasus and Georgia following the last war fought with Persia and the resulting Treaty of Gulistan, he found himself able to make major adjustments. In 1818 he changed the Russian tactics from defensive to offensive and began building the Sunzha-Vladikavkaz line where strongholds such as Groznaya and Vnezapnaya were founded. Yermolov further reformed the whole structure of the Cossacks and in 1819 replaced elected Atamans with appointed commanders.\n\nIn Transcaucasia, Cossacks took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829) where they participated in the Siege of Kars and other key battles. After Yermolov was recalled from the Caucasus, a new reform took place and the interim regiments in the central Caucasus were united with the three Hosts on the Terek to form the Caucasus Line Cossack Host (Кавказское линейное казачье войско, \"Kavkazskoye lineynoye kazachye voysko\") in 1832, and the new Nakazny Ataman was named Peter Verzilin. Several reforms followed: In 1836 the Kizlyar and Family regiments were united and made responsible for the Terek Delta, and in 1837 a Malorossiyan (Little Russian) regiment (formed in 1831 to combat the November Uprising in Poland) was resettled on the upper Terek north of Vladikavkaz. In 1842 the regiment was incorporated into the Line host. This was followed by the formation of the Sunzha regiment with its Ataman Sleptsov.\n\nBy this point the Russian control in the Caucasus had improved, with the initiative firmly in the Cossack hands. Most of the battles took place in Chechen and Dagestani territories far away from Cossack homes. During the 1840s several successful expeditions were mounted deep into the mountains. The Line Cossacks participated in the Crimean War (1853–1856) and finally in the closing phase of the Russian advance against Shamil in 1859.\n\nThe end of the Caucasus War marked the end of the Line Cossack Host. In 1860 it was divided, with the two western regiments joining the Black Sea Cossacks to form the Kuban Cossack Host and the remaining into the Terek Cossack Host. The next decade showed a gradual reform from military to civil control. In 1865 a permanent police force was formed, and in 1869 the Terek Oblast was formed, consisting of eight mountainous districts (populated by indigenous people) and seven Cossack subdivisions. Several regimental reforms followed: Kizlyar and Rower as well as Mountain and Mozdok regiments were united into two (reducing the number of sub-divisions to five), and in 1871 a charter for Terek Cossacks was published.\n\nFrom the 1870s onwards the Eastern Caucasus remained largely peaceful (if one discounts uprisings waged by the Chechens in the late 1870s and the occasional exchange of raids). However the Terek Cossacks took part in several Imperial Wars, including campaigns against Khiva in 1873. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) the Terek Cossacks sent six cavalry regiments, one Guards squadron and one mounted artillery regiment to the Balkans and a further seven regiments and mounted battery were mobilized against the rebelling Chechens and Dagestanis, who initiated an uprising against Tsarist authorities in 1878.\n\nIn the 1880s the arrival of the railways and the discovery of oil made the Terek Oblast one of the wealthiest in the Caucasus, resulting in a large growth in Cossack and indigenous mountain populations. This created friction on land ownership. The Cossacks held extensive fertile areas in the lowlands and steppes, whilst the indigenous mountain populations only held land in the mountainous zones. Peace was preserved, by a complex Russian policy of supporting loyal clan leaders and free supplies of food and goods The Terek Cossacks took part in campaigns against Geok-Tepe in 1879 and in 1885 up to the Afghan border in Central Asia.\n\nUntil 1914 the Terek Cossack Host wore a full dress uniform comprising a dark grey/black kaftan (knee length collarless coat) with light blue shoulder straps and braid on the wide cuffs. Ornamental containers (\"czerkeska\") which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an open front, showing a light blue waistcoat. Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft leather boots without heels. Officers wore silver epaulettes, braiding and ferrules, the latter in their \"czerkeskas\". This Caucasian national dress was also worn by the Kuban Cossack Host but in different facing colors. Tall black fur hats were worn on all occasions with light blue cloth tops and (for officers) silver lace. A whip was used instead of spurs. Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses, Caucasian saddles and harness). On active service during World War I the Terek Cossacks retained their distinctive dress but with a dark waistcoat replacing the conspicuous light blue one and without the silver ornaments or blue facings of full dress. A black felt cloak (\"bourki\") was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.\n\nThe Terk and Kuban Cossacks of the Imperial Escort (\"Konvoi\") wore a special gala uniform; including a scarlet kaftan edged with gold braid and a white waistcoat.\n\nThe arrival of the February and later the October Revolution caught most Cossacks on the front lines in Kurdistan. The unrequited mountainous peoples took full advantage of the crises, Chechens and Ingush on the Sunzha line wiping out several Cossack stanitsas. The Bolsheviks were able to establish themselves in Grozny and Vladikavkaz, though Denikin's Volunteer Army drove them out across the Caucasian lands to Astrakhan.\n\nAlthough Cossacks did form a substantial part of Denikin's units, the Terek Cossacks were mostly involved in fighting the Caucasus insurgency against their traditional adversaries (Denikin's units became known among native Caucasians for their brutality and their association with the Cossacks). In 1920 many Terek Cossacks were deported to Ukraine and the northern part of European Russia and a new Mountain ASSR was formed. This left the former Sunzha-Terek Mesopotamia triangle split by the returned Chechen land stretching through the middle. The remaining portions were formed by the Sunzha Cossack Okrug which also encompassed lands around Grozny. However, the Sunzha's importance to the Vainakh peoples as their historical territorial heart ensured that the early communists, mindful of the claims of indigenous peoples, would return it in order to turn them from the Mensheviks toward the Bolsheviks (to balance out the anti-Bolshevik Cossacks). A deadlock formed in the Northern Caucasus. On one hand, the Cossacks were very adverse to Bolshevism, and the latter responded with a Decossackization policy. On the other hand, many mountainous peoples were hostile to any Russian rule, Red or White (most originally looked to the Reds as a force also fighting against their foes, the Cossacks, but after the Reds began adopting similar policies as their Tzarist predecessors, resentment resurfaced), and continued fighting Russian/Cossack populations. In the end, the Red Army had to use Cossack tactics and hire local population to police the region. The idea of sandwiching a Cossack district within a Chechen autonomy was seen as a solution.\n\nIn the 1930s, to make the mountainous autonomies more sustainable in economical terms, they were united with the remaining Cossack holdings: the Sunzha district was retaken by the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, the former capital of the Terek Oblast, Vladikavkaz became the administrative centre for North Ossetia, likewise the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Oblast was also awarded to Cossack territories. On the lower Terek, between 1923 and 1937, the Dagestan ASSR administered the extensive territory there (Kizlyar, Terek Delta). Thus by the start of the Second World War only the historical Terek Left-bank was not administered by autonomies. However, on the other hand, all these lands (northern Chechnya, Kizlyar, Little Kabarda, historical North Ossetia, East Prigorodny/Western Ingushetia, etc.) had historically been inhabited by Caucasian peoples before the end of the Caucasian Wars.\n\nThus by the start of the Second World War only the historical Terek Left-bank was not administered by autonomies, however, most of the administration and urban population of those regions was dominated by ethnic Russians. This was paralleled with the gradual down-folding of anti-Cossack repressions and their eventual rehabilitation by the mid-1930s, including forming numerous units in the Red Army.\n\nCossacks fought on both sides of the Second World War. Many Cossack prisoners of war joined Nazi Germany who promised to free their lands from Bolshevism. Terek Cossacks made up the Vth regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Cossack Division. Soon the war came to Cossack lands themselves, in 1942 the Nazi offensive Case Blue, and by autumn, the western regions of the former Terek Cossack Hosts were occupied. By November, the Battle of the Caucasus reached North Ossetia, and Germans were already making plans to lease the oilfields in Grozny. Most of the Cossack population took part in repelling the invader.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 30s, despite efforts of Soviet Union to pacify the mountainous peoples via different programmes, such as Korenizatsiya, there was still low-level criminal secession movements in the highlands. Nazi Germany decided to use this friction in creating a fifth column out of them. In the central Caucasus, these were the Karachay and Balkars who carried out low-level insurgency. Further east, these were the Vainakhs and an existing insurgency by a Khasan Israilov was fuelled by supplies via Nazi paradrops. By autumn 1942, the insurgency diverted significant Red Army resources, including aviation.\n\nHowever, after the Battle of Stalingrad the Germans began a mass evacuation from the Caucasus. The price that mountainous people paid was dear, in late 1943 as part of Soviet Collective punishment, Operation Lentil began, which saw a total deportation of all Chechens, Ingush, Karachay and Balkar people to Kazakhstan. In the aftermath, most of the land was portioned, between loyal mountainous peoples such as Kabardins, Ossetians and Dagestanis, and Russians and Cossacks. For example, a vast Grozny Oblast was created encompassing almost all of the historic lower-Terek Cossack lands, whilst North Ossetia took the Sunzha and Kabardin ASSR had central line cossack stanitsas.\n\nThis status quo continued until the second half of the 1950s, when there was once again a cool-down in Soviet government towards Cossacks after the death of Joseph Stalin. In 1957, all of the deported mountainous people were rehabilitated, and their republics restored. However this was not done in previous borders, for example, the historic homeland of lower Terek, Naursky and Schyolkovsky districts were incorporated into the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, whilst the Kizlyar district was passed onto Dagestan. Old problems of land ownership quickly resurfaced, and many returning Chechens and Ingush, forbidden to re-settle in the mountains, were settled in Cossack stanitsas.\n\nThe politics of Stagnationed USSR towards titular nations was also two-faced, on one hand all signs of nationalism were repressed, on the other hand Soviet authorities actively encouraged assignation of jobs and selection to the minorities rather than Russians. As a result, of the positive discrimination and better economic prospects in other regions of the USSR, many Russians migrated from the Northern Caucasus to other regions, such as the Tselina, Russian Far East and the Baltic Republics. Naturally, the high birth rate, of the mountainous peoples, meant that many sold their homes to them.\n\nAlthough this hid the historic adversity between Russians and Caucasus people, it never removed the tension, as both sides saw each other gaining favours at their expense.\n\nDuring the perestroika, Cossacks once again took steps to re-create their nationality . Many Cossack organisations were formed throughout the former Host. However, in doing so, many wished to review the existing administrative borders in the Northern Caucasus, and return the Cossack regions, that belonged to the once Terek Oblast from the national autonomies. In Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia and Dagestan this was resolved by granting the Cossacks full minority rights, that raised on par with titular nations, and today Cossacks play an important role in local administration, culture and development.\n\nIn Chechnya and Ingushetia however, the situation was different. There was a long-running ethnic conflict between the Chechen returnees and the Russian settlers of the region. Before 1989, the Russians had dominated all parts of government as well as the workforce, but then this reversed with the \"Chechen revolution\" in 1990, where the Chechen and Ingush majority took control of the ruling of their homeland. Russians were left jobless as able Vainakh took their places. The Russian language remained in many schools and the Russians of the republic were not immediately made victims.\n\nCossacks and Russians, unsurprisingly, were staunch foes of Chechen independence from Russia. Chechens feared that Cossacks were variously plotting to undermine the independence which they saw as a desperate necessity and to detach a large part of their state. The chronic economic hardship of Chechnya during and after the Soviet period and the large income gap between Russians and Chechens before 1990 also worsened tensions. For these reasons and for the centuries of fighting between Cossacks and Chechens, ethnic relations were highly hostile.\n\nPresident Dzhokkar Dudayev, himself married to a Russian, tried to suppress ethnic tensions, which he viewed as a destabilizing element to an already impoverished and internationally isolated republic. However, the statements of the President about \"hospitality\" were not convincing enough, and Dudayev had other priorities, such as handling the economic conditions inherited from the Soviet age and international isolation, another major problem.\n\nAn exodus of ethnic Russians occurred, although its causes and intensity are disputed. Some sources say that virtually the whole Russian population that left (300,000 people) before the First Chechen War, which others dispute, saying that while tens of thousands (as opposed to 300,000) left, most left due to the First Chechen War during it; Russian sources claim it was due to anti-Russian discrimination and violence, whereas others (such as Russian liberals Boris Lvin and Andrei Illarionov, and Western commentators Gall and De Waal< see below) cite economic reasons and the loss of the previous disproportionate privilege held by the Russians during Soviet times, as well as the mass bombing of Grozny during the First Chechen War, where 4 out of 5 Russians in Chechnya lived. As noted by ethnic Russian economists Boris Lvin and Andrei Illiaronov, the rate and number of departures of ethnic Russians from Chechnya during 1991–94 was actually less than other areas (Kalmykia, Tuva and Yakutia).\n\nThere is also dispute that Chechens were antagonistic towards ethnic Russians and Cossacks because they were ethnic Russian (as opposed to because of their hostility to Chechen statehood) - there were two originally ethnic Russian Chechen teips, and the president's wife was Russian. The Chechen clan system protects individuals from theft and murder because the whole clan would become involved, and one can join a teip - thus, those who didn't join teips (like the Cossacks) would be subject to theft by the poor, etc.\n\nMany of the educated elite also lost their positions in government, industry and academia to locals connected with those in power (which previously they had a vast advantage in due to the situation after the return of the Chechens from exile). Nadteretchny, Naursky and Shelkovskoy \"raions\" of the Republic of Chechnya practically lost the traditional Cossack population.\n\nAfter an attempted coup against Dudayev (who was seen as a threat to Russian oil transit) failed, Moscow responded with a military operation to reconquer Chechnya (see First Chechen War); many Terek Cossacks jumped at the opportunity to show their loyalty, and formed volunteer units that operated with the Russian Army. These were created to fight in the Sunzha and Terek stanitsas against Chechens.\n\nDuring the Second Chechen War, once again Cossack units took part as an auxiliary support, and this time were allowed to establish in the Naursky raion, which still had a Russian minority; today the stanitsa of Naurskaya remains strongly associated with the Cossack movement in Chechnya.\n\nThe two wars have brought large suffering to both the Cossacks and the Chechens.\n\n"}
{"id": "1903705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903705", "title": "Liutprand, King of the Lombards", "text": "Liutprand, King of the Lombards\n\nLiutprand was the King of the Lombards from 712 to 744 and is chiefly remembered for his Donation of Sutri, in 728, his multiple phases of law-giving, in fifteen separate sessions from 713 to 733 inclusive, and his long reign, which brought him into a series of conflicts, mostly successful, with most of Italy. He is often regarded as the most successful Lombard monarch, notable for the Donation of Sutri, which was the first accolade of sovereign territory to the Papacy.\n\nLiutprand's life began inauspiciously. His father was driven to exile among the Bavarians, his older brother Sigipert was blinded by Aripert II, king of the Lombards, and his mother Theodarada and sister Aurona were mutilated (their noses and ears were cut off). Liutprand was spared only because his youth made him appear harmless, described as adolescens in Paul the Deacon's \"Historia Langobardorum\" (Book VI, xxii), suggesting that he was 'probably older than 19 but still in his twenties'. He was released from Aripert II's custody and allowed to join his father.\n\nThe reign of Liutprand, son of Ansprand, duke of Asti and briefly king of the Lombards, began the day before his father's death when magnates called to Ansprand's deathbed consented to make Liutprand his colleague. Liutprand's reign endured for thirty-one years. Within the Lombard kingdom he was considered a lawgiver of irreproachable Catholicity.\n\nAt the opening of his reign, Liutprand's chief ally among neighboring rulers was the Agilolfing Theodo I, the Frankish duke of Bavaria. Theodo I's intervention on Ansprand's behalf helped him gain the throne. Theodo had taken him in, when he and his father were temporarily expelled by Aripert II in 702, and the hospitality was later cemented with a marriage connection: Liutprand took to wife the Agilolfing Guntrud. The core of Theodo's policy was resistance to the Merovingian mayors of the palaces in their encroachments north of the Alps, concerns that did not much occupy Liutprand, and maintaining strategic control of the eastern Alpine passes in what is now the Italian Alps, which did. In the spring of 712, Theodo’s son Theodebert, with Ansprand and Liutprand, attacked Lombard strongholds, and with the drowning of their fleeing rival Aripert, Ansprand's faction were back in power at Pavia.\n\nTheodo died in 717 or 718; under his successor the Lombard ties with the Agilolfing weakened. Until distracted by Byzantine politics in 726, Liutprand's chief warmaking energies were concentrated on taking Bavarian castles on the River Adige.\n\nIn his early reign, Liutprand did not attack the Exarchate of Ravenna or the Papacy. But in 726, the Emperor Leo III made his first of many edicts outlawing images or icons (see the iconoclastic controversy). The pope, Gregory II, ordered the people to resist and the Byzantine duke of Naples, Exhiliratus, was killed by a mob while trying to carry out the imperial command to destroy all the icons. Liutprand chose this time of division to strike the Byzantine possessions in Emilia. In 727, he crossed the Po and took Bologna, Osimo, Rimini and Ancona, along with the other cities of Emilia and the Pentapolis. He took Classis, the seaport of Ravenna, but could not take Ravenna itself from the exarch Paul. Paul was soon killed in a riot, however. Eventually, Ravenna would capitulate to Liutprand with barely a fight (737).\n\nThe first Moorish raids on Corsica began around 713–719 from the Balearic Islands to the west. Acting as the protector of the Catholic Church and its faithful, Liutprand subjected the island to Lombard government (c. 725), though it was nominally under Byzantine authority. Corsica remained with the Lombard kingdom even after the Frankish conquest, by which time Lombard landholders and churches had established a significant presence on the island.\n\nWhen the Saracens invaded Sardinia, Liutprand redeemed the body of Augustine about the year 720. He brought it with great ceremony to Pavia, and enshrined it in the Church of Saint Peter, which was then the cathedral of Pavia. He rescued the relics stationed on the island with great haste as well as with great expense, according to Paul the Deacon.\n\nHaving just overwhelmed the Byzantine forces, though it was left to his heirs to make the final vestige of the Exarchate of Ravenna Lombard at last, Liutprand advanced towards Rome along the Via Cassia; he was met at the ancient city of Sutri by Pope Gregory II (728). There the two reached an agreement, by which Sutri and some hill towns in Latium (see Vetralla) were given to the Papacy, \"as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul\" according to the \"Liber Pontificalis\". They were the first extension of Papal territory beyond the confines of the Duchy of Rome. This was the beginning of the Papal States.\n\nIn the meantime, Leo sent Eutychius, as Exarch of Ravenna, to take control of Italy. When Eutychius arrived at Naples, he made an agreement whereby Liutprand would attack the Pope if the Greeks aided him in subjugating the contumacious and independent southern Lombard duchies, the Duchy of Spoleto and the Duchy of Benevento. The dukes, Thrasimund II and Godescalc, surrendered — though control of the duchies from Pavia was not to endure for long — and the new exarch marched on Rome. At Rome, Liutprand camped on the far bank of the Tiber in the \"Field of Nero\" and arbitrated, returning to the exarch the city of Ravenna alone among the Byzantine territories and prevailing on the pope to restore his allegiance to the emperor (730).\n\nFollowing the death of Theodo, Liutprand turned from his former Agilolfing allies to bind himself to Charles Martel, duke of the Franks, whose son, Pepin the Short, he adopted and girded with arms at his coming of manhood. In 733 Liutprand promulgated the \"Notitia de actoribus regis\", a series of six laws, presaging the later Frankish capitulary in structure. They sought to curb the usurpation by local administrators of public lands.\n\nIn 735–736, a serious illness encouraged Liutprand to raise his nephew Hildeprand to co-kingship. In 736–737, Liutprand crossed the Alps with an army to help Charles expel the Moors from Aix-en-Provence and Arles.\n\nIn 738, a long peace was broken by the rebellious Lombard duke of Spoleto, Thrasimund II. When the revolt was suppressed, with nephews of Liutprand established at Beneventum and Spoleto, the dukes fled to Rome and the protection of Pope Gregory III. Liutprand immediately began the conquest of the \"Ducatus Romanus\", the province around Rome. After capturing Orte and Bomarzo, he arrived at Rome and besieged it. The Pope sent an embassy to Charles Martel to beg for aid, promising favour then and in the future world: the cover letter survives. Gregory conferred on him the title of patrician. Gregory's anti-Lombard rhetoric reached absurd heights considering Liutprand's orthodoxy; the Lombard king only wanted his rebellious dukes to face justice. Charles ignored the pope's excessive charges against his erstwhile ally and instead sent back his own embassy to mediate between the two Italian powers. Before any headway was made, however, both pope and Frank died.\n\nSoon after the death of Gregory III (741), Zachary was elected to the Apostolic See; Liutprand happily signed a twenty-year peace and restored the cities of the Duchy of Rome of which he had taken possession. Soon after, his reign ended in peace. Having passed more years on the throne and come closer to bringing the entire peninsula under one rule than any of his predecessors, the great Lombard died in 744 and was buried in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, in Pavia.\n\nThe main source for the career of Liutprand is the \"Historia Langobardorum\" of Paul the Deacon, which idealises Liutprand. It was written after 787 and covers the story of the Lombards from 568 to the death of Liutprand in 744. Though written by a Lombard from a Lombard point of view, it contains much information about the Eastern Roman Empire, the Franks, and others.\n\n\n"}

The original line up included Van Temple on guitar and vocals, former Whiteface member Kyle Henderson on bass and vocals, former Billy Joe Royal sideman Wayne Famous (Wayne McNatt) on keyboards, and Bryan Holmes on drums.\n\nOriginally formed as a Beatles cover band named Cartoon, they changed musical directions and began performing their own material in nightclubs around the Atlanta area. The response to their music was so good that they were quickly signed to Columbia Records subsidiary Portrait Records by producer Tom Werman, who had worked with Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon and Mother's Finest. They released two albums for the Portrait label, \"The Producers\" (1981) and \"You Make the Heat\" (1982). The Producers became a regional favorite in the southeastern United States, propelling \"What She Does To Me\" onto the national Billboard Magazine singles charts. \"What's He Got\", \"Certain Kinda Girl\", and \"Who Do You Think You Are\" had some popularity as music videos on MTV, but did not chart. The band toured extensively in the early 1980s, opening for Cheap Trick, and The Motels. \"She Sheila\" from their second album was also a popular MTV video. They headlined MTV's New Year's Rockin Eve broadcast in 1982.\n\nDespite this success, Portrait Records dropped the band after only two albums. Kyle Henderson became a born-again Christian and left the band shortly after they were dropped to record a solo album for Kerry Livgren's Christian rock label, Kerygma Records and was replaced by future Jellyfish, Umajets, and Sheryl Crow bassist Tim Smith (not to be confused with another musician named Tim Smith — born 1961 — of the progressive art punk outfit Cardiacs). The next Producers album, \"Run For Your Life\", was released in 1985 on a small Atlanta-based independent label. That album featured a collaboration between The Producers and Kansas, \"Can't Cry Anymore,\" a song which appeared on both \"Run For Your Life\" and the 1986 Kansas album \"Power\". The Producers regained a major label contract in the late 1980s with MCA Records and recorded what was to be their fourth album, \"Coelacanth\", but the band was one of several dropped in a 1989 label purge at MCA before the album could be released. \"Coelacanth\" was finally released in 2001.\n\nLead vocal/guitarist Van Temple now moonlights with bands The Rainmen and Reason Y in Atlanta.

Bangla Academy hosts the annual Ekushey Book Fair.\n\nThe importance of establishing an organisation for Bengali language was first emphasised by the linguist Muhammad Shahidullah. Later, following the Language movement, on 27 April 1952, the All Party National Language Committee decided to demand establishment of an organisation for the promotion of Bengali language. During the 1954 parliamentary elections, the United Front's 21-point manifesto stated that, \"The prime minister from the United Front will dedicate the Bardhaman House for establishing a research center for the Bengali language\". Following the election success of the Front, the education minister Syed Azizul Haque placed the order to fulfill this promise.\n\nIn 1955, the government formed a committee to expedite the process. The committee was composed of leading intellectuals like Muhammad Shahidullah, Qazi Motahar Hossain, S.M. Bhattacharya, W. H. Shadani, and Muhammad Barkatullah. On 3 December 1955, the Chief Minister of East Bengal, Abu Hussain Sarkar, inaugurated the institute. Barkatullah acted as the Special Officer in charge. Later, in 1956, Muhammad Enamul Haque took over as the first director.\n\nIn 1957, an act of the parliament formally established the funding source and the Government support for the institute. The first book published by the academy was Laili Maznu, an epic by the medieval poet Dawlat Ujir Bahram Khan, and edited by Ahmed Sharif.

Khan is of the opinion that the Academy is short on original publications long on dross. He believes that both in research and in the field of creative writing, originality must be given priority. He also adds that most of the problems lie in the process of selection. The selection process the crucial decision to ditch one manuscript to pick another that will be added to the long list of academy publications, is faulty and in dire need of revision.\n\nThis award is conferred for significant contributions to Rabindranath Tagore works.\n\n\nThis award is conferred to the Bangladeshi poets since 2010.\n\nAs of 2016, there are 159 persons made Honorary Fellows by the academy.\n"}

In the 1790s, the host was re-settled to the Kuban River. It comprised the Caucasus Fortified Defence Line from the mouth of the Kuban River to the mouth of the Bolshaya Laba River.\n\nThe Black Sea host played a crucial role in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1797. As a result, Catherine II rewarded them with the Kuban land in the North Caucasus (north of the Kuban River, south of the Yeya River and east of the Sea of Azov) by her decree of June 30, 1792. At that time the area was inhabited by a few Nogain steppe nomads. When Russia annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783 it inherited the Crimean claim to this land. South of the Kuban were Circassians.\n\nRenamed the Black Sea Cossack Host in honor of the victories during the Russo-Turkish War, a total of 25,000 people made the migration in 1792-1794 from Ukraine, settling in the regions north of the Kuban River. Initially, the Black Sea Cossacks adhered to Zaporozhian traditions, such as the democratic election of the host government, but in time they adopted many Russian ways.\n\nInstead of a central Sich, they formed a defence line from the inlet of the Kuban River into the Black Sea to the inlet of the Bolshaya Laba River, and colonised the land north of this line with stanitsas.\n\nThe Cossacks founded the administrative centre of Yekaterinodar (literally \"Catherine's gift\") in 1794. At the same time, however, the Black Sea Cossacks also sent men to many major campaigns of the Russian Empire, such as the suppression of the Polish Kościuszko Uprising in 1794 and the ill-fated Persian Expedition of 1796 where nearly half of the Cossacks died from hunger and disease.\n\nThe Host sent the 9th plastun (infantry) and 1st joint cavalry regiments as well as the first Leib Guards (elite) sotnia to aid the Russian Army during the Patriotic War of 1812. The new host also participated in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) where they stormed the last remaining Ottoman bastion of the northern Black Sea Coast, the fortress of Anapa, which fell on June 12, 1828. In the course of the Crimean War, the Cossacks foiled attempts by allied forces to land on the Taman Peninsula, whilst the 2nd and 5th plastun battalions took part in the Defence of Sevastopol (1854-1855).\n\nAs the years went by, the Black Sea Cossacks continued their systematic penetration into the mountainous regions of the Northern Caucasus. Taking an active part in the finale of the Russian conquest of the Northern Caucasus (1817-1864), they settled regions as these were conquered. To aid them, a total of 70,000 additional ex-Zaporozhians from the Bug, Yekaterinoslav, and finally the Azov Cossack Host migrated there in the mid 19th century. All three hosts needed to be removed to vacate space for the colonisation of New Russia, and with the increasing weakness of the Ottoman Empire as well as the formation of independent buffer states in the Balkans, the need for further Cossack defensive presence in New Russia had ended. They migrated to the Kuban in 1860 and merged with the Caucasus Line Cossack Host, which consisted of migrated Don Cossack elements. Finally, in 1864, the Black Sea Cossacks and the Azov Cossacks were united into the Kuban Cossack Host, ninety years after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich.\n\nUpon creation, the territory of the host was governed by the military government. Later, a dedicated military executive office was created, which was headed by the host's ataman. In military matters, this office was subordinated to Kherson's military governor and, since 1802, to the Crimean Inspectorate. In civil matters, the office was subordinated to the Governor of Taurida Governorate.\n"}

The trap is named after the French player Sire de Légal (1702–1792). Joseph Henry Blackburne (1841–1924), a British master and one of the world's top five players in the latter part of the 19th century, set the trap on many occasions.\nThere is a number of ways the trap can arise; the one below shows a natural move sequence from a simultaneous exhibition in Paris. André Cheron, one of France's leading players, won with the trap as White against Jeanlose:\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 \n\n4. Nc3 Bg4\n\n5. h3 \n\n5... Bh5 (see diagram)\n\n6. Nxe5\n\n6... Bxd1 7. Bxf7+ Ke7 8. Nd5\n\nThe original game featured Légal playing at rook odds (without Ra1) against Saint Brie in Paris 1750:\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Bg4?! 4. Nc3 g6? 5. Nxe5 Bxd1?? 6. Bxf7+ Ke7 7. Nd5# \n\n1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 d6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nc3 Bg4 5. Nxe5? Bxd1?? 6. Bxf7+ Ke7 7. Nd5# 1–0\n\nThis kind of mate, where an apparently pinned knight moves anyway, allowing capture of the queen, but leading to a checkmate with minor pieces, occasionally occurs at lower levels of play, though masters would not normally fall for it. According to Bjerke (\"Spillet i mitt liv\"), the Légal Trap has ensnared countless unwary players. One author writes that \"Blackburne sprang it several hundreds of times during his annual tours.\"\n\nIn general, setting up a \"trap\" by luring a bishop into a queen capture is not strictly necessary. Any game featuring an advanced knight and Bxf7+ (or ...Bxf2+) followed by mate with minor pieces would be considered a Légal Mate. The mate succeeds because the square of the advanced knight is unguarded, and the enemy king is blocked by several of its own pieces.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

It's thought to be named because of the supposed chickens owned by residents of other nearby islands who travel here to collect the eggs; however, there are no chickens on Egg Island. Another theory is that local sea bird eggs were often collected here by the first settlers, these were then wiped out by the introduction of goats to the island a long time ago.\n\nThe island has a crescent shaped beach that is protected by a reef that protects the entire beach. The water behind the reef is generally less than deep making it a good place to swim or watch the sea life. Since the water is so shallow and well protected, it tends to be warmer than the surrounding sea.\n\nEgg Island gained some fame in the 1980s when Arne Molander claimed that this was the first island where Columbus landed in his 1492 voyage to the New World.\n\nOff the island is the wreck of the \"Arimoroa\".\n\nRecently, Egg Island has gained international recognition after Disney Cruise Lines started exploring the area for possible development of a cruise ship port. This project would have entailed dredging the sea bed to make way for a cruise ship port, drilling into and destroying coral reefs. Residents of nearby Spanish Wells and north Eleuthera were extremely concerned at the implications and started a petition to have the sale of Egg Island to Disney halted. The primary concern is that Egg Island is a natural nursery for sea turtles, juvenile fish including snapper and grouper, crawfish (lobster), conch, stingrays, sea birds and other wild sealife, and any disturbance to the delicate eco-system would prove fatal to these animals and by default, detrimental to the local fishing industry. After the petition was signed by thousands and much agitation, Disney announced that due to the environmental impact, they would not proceed with the project. Joseph Darville spoke on behalf of local environmental organisation Save the Bays and Waterkeepers Bahamas, stating in a public release, \"“The corporate entity, Disney Cruise Lines, demonstrated responsibility and made the right choice. The community got together and spoke in a voice that could not be ignored about an activity that would have changed their way of life and could have destroyed much of the fish population on which they depend for their livelihood because the reefs and the mangroves around Egg Island are important fish, conch and crawfish nurseries and habitats. And the environmental impact assessment did what it was created for. Based on science, not emotion, it showed that there would have been damage and destruction of the marine environment.”\n\nA comment on the Disney blog placed the blame for the situation on the Bahamian government, stating that If Bahamians want to protect their lands they should focus efforts on their own government. Government officials allowed Disney to evaluate the potential of Egg Island as a cruise destination.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1903774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903774", "title": "Huo Qubing", "text": "Huo Qubing\n\nHuo Qubing (140 BC – 117 BC) was a distinguished military general of the Western Han dynasty during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. He was the nephew of the general Wei Qing and Empress Wei Zifu (Emperor Wu's wife), and the half-brother of the statesman Huo Guang. Along with Wei Qing, he led a campaign into the Gobi Desert of what is now Mongolia to defeat the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, winning decisive victories such as the Battle of Mobei in 119 BC.\n\nHuo Qubing was an illegitimate son from the premarital affair between Wei Shaoer (), daughter of a lowly maid from the household of Princess Pingyang, and Huo Zhongru (), a low-class civil servant who were employed there also at the time. However, Huo Zhongru did not want to marry a girl from a lower class background, so he abandoned Wei Shaoer and went back to his home town to marry a local woman instead. Wei Shaoer insisted on keeping the child, raising him with help of her siblings.\n\nWhen Huo Qubing was around two years old, his aunt, Wei Zifu, who was the younger sister of Wei Shaoer, was serving as an in-house singer/dancer for Princess Pingyang, when she caught the attention of the young Emperor Wu, who took her and her half-brother, Wei Qing, back to his palace in the capital, Chang'an. More than a year later, the newly favoured concubine Wei Zifu became pregnant with Emperor Wu's first child, earning her the jealousy and hatred of Emperor Wu's then formal wife, Empress Chen. Empress Chen's mother, Eldest Princess Guantao (), then attempted to retaliate against Wei Zifu by kidnapping and attempting to murder Wei Qing, who was then serving with the cavalry at the Jianzhang Camp (建章營, Emperor Wu's royal guards). After Wei Qing was rescued by his fellow palace guards led by his close friend, Gongsun Ao (), Emperor Wu took the opportunity to humiliate Empress Chen and Princess Guantao, by promoting Wei Zifu to a consort (夫人, a concubine position lower only to the Empress) and Wei Qing to the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (), Chief of Staff (), and Chief Councillor (), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants. The rest of the Wei family were also well rewarded, including the decreed marriage of Wei Shaoer's older sister Wei Junru () to Emperor Wu's adviser, Gongsun He (). At the time, Wei Shaoer was romantically engaged with Chen Zhang (), a great-grandson of Emperor Gaozu's adviser Chen Ping. Their relationship was also legitimized by Emperor Wu through the form of decreed marriage. Through the rise of the Wei family, the young Huo Qubing grew up in prosperity and prestige.\n\nHuo Qubing exhibited outstanding military talent even as a teenager. Emperor Wu saw Huo's potential and made Huo his personal assistant.\nIn 123 BC, Emperor Wu sent Wei Qing from Dingxiang () to engage the invading Xiongnu, and appointed the 18-year-old Huo Qubing to serve as the Captain of Piaoyao () under his uncle, seeing real combat for the first time. Although Wei Qing was able to kill or capture more than 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, part of his vanguard forces, a 3,000-strong regiment commanded by generals Su Jian (蘇建, father of the Han diplomat and statesman, Su Wu) and Zhao Xin (趙信, a surrendered Xiongnu prince) was outnumbered and annihilated after encountering the Xiongnu force led by Yizhixie Chanyu (). Zhao Xin defected on the field with his 800 ethnic Xiongnu subordinates, while Su Jian escaped after losing all his men in the desperate fighting. Due to the loss of this detachment, Wei Qing's troops did not earn any promotion, but Huo Qubing distinguished himself by leading a long-distance search-and-destroy mission with 800 light cavalrymen, killing the Chanyu's grandfather and over 2,000 enemy troops, as well as capturing numerous Xiongnu nobles. A very impressed Emperor Wu then made Huo Qubing the Marquess of Champion () with a march of 2,500 households.\n\nIn 121 BC, Emperor Wu deployed Huo Qubing twice in that year against the Xiongnu in the Hexi Corridor. During spring, Huo Qubing led 10,000 cavalry, fought through five Western Regions kingdoms within 6 days, advanced over 1,000 \"li\" over Mount Yanzhi (), killed two Xiongnu princes along with nearly 9,000 enemy troops, and captured several Xiongnu nobles as well as the golden statue used by Xiongnu as an artifact for holy rituals. For this achievement, his march was increased by 2,200 households. During the summer of the same year, Xiongnu attacked the Dai Commandery and Yanmen. Huo Qubing set off from Longxi (modern-day Gansu) with over 10,000 cavalry, supported by Gongsun Ao, who set off from the Beidi Commandery (北地郡, modern-day Huan County, Gansu). Despite Gongsun Ao failing to keep up, Huo Qubing travelled over 2,000 \"li \"without backup\",\" all the way past Juyan Lake to Qilian Mountains, killing over 30,000 Xiongnu soldiers and capturing a dozen Xiongnu princes. His march was then increased further by a 5,400 households for the victory.\n\nHuo Qubing's victories dealt heavy blows to the tribes of the Xiongnu princes of Hunxie () and Xiutu () that occupied the Hexi Corridor. Out of frustration, Yizhixie Chanyu wanted to mercilessly execute those two princes as punishment. The Prince of Hunxie contacted the Han government in autumn of 121 BC to negotiate a surrender. Failing to persuade his fellow prince to do the same, he killed the Prince of Xiutu and ordered Xiutu's forces to also surrender. When the two tribes went to meet the Han forces, Xiutu's forces rioted. Seeing the situation changed, Huo Qubing alone headed to the Xiongnu camp. There, the general ordered the Prince of Hunxie to calm his men and stand down before putting down 8,000 Xiongnu men who refused to disarm, effectively quelling the riot. The Hunxie tribe was then resettled into the Central Plain. The surrender of the Xiutu and Hunxie tribes stripped Xiongnu of any control over the Western Regions, depriving them of a large grazing area. As a result, Han Dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct trade access to Central Asia. This also provided a new supply of high-quality horse breeds from Central Asia, including the famed Ferghana horse (ancestors of the modern Akhal-Teke), further strengthening the Han army. Emperor Wu then reinforced this strategic asset by establishing five commanderies and constructing a length of fortified wall along the border of the Hexi Corridor. He colonised the area with 700,000 Chinese soldier-settlers.\n\nAfter the series of defeats by Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Yizhixie Chanyu took Zhao Xin's advice and retreated with his tribes to the north of the Gobi Desert, hoping that the barren land would serve as a natural barrier against Han offensives. Emperor Wu however, was far from giving up, and planned a massive expeditionary campaign in 119 BC. Han forces were deployed in two separate columns, each consisting of 50,000 cavalry and over 100,000 infantry, with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing serving as the supreme commander for each.\n\nEmperor Wu, who had been distancing Wei Qing and giving the younger Huo Qubing more attention and favour, hoped that Huo would engage the stronger Chanyu's tribe and preferentially assigned him the most elite troopers. The initial plan called for Huo Qubing to attack from Dingxiang (定襄, modern-day Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia) and engage the Chanyu, with Wei Qing supporting him in the east from Dai Commandery (代郡, modern-day, Yu County, Hebei) to engage the Left Worthy Prince (). However, a Xiongnu prisoner of war confessed that the Chanyu's main force was at the east side. Unaware that this was actually false information provided by the Xiongnu, Emperor Wu ordered the two columns to switch routes, with Wei Qing now setting off on the western side from Dingxiang, and Huo Qubing marching on the eastern side from the Dai Commandery.\n\nBattles at the eastern Dai Commandery theatre were quite straightforward, as Huo Qubing's forces were far superior to their enemies. Huo Qubing advanced over 2,000 \"li\" and directly engaged the Left Worthy Prince in a swift and decisive battle. He quickly encircled and overran the Xiongnu, killing over 70,000 men, and capturing three lords and 83 nobles, while suffering a 20% casualty rate that was quickly resupplied from local captives. He then went on to conduct a series of rituals upon his arrival at the Khentii Mountains (狼居胥山, and the more northern 姑衍山) to symbolize the historic Han victory, then continued his pursuit as far as Lake Baikal (), effectively annihilating the Xiongnu clan. A separate division led by Lu Bode (), set off on a strategically flanking route from Right Beiping (右北平, modern-day Ningcheng County, Inner Mongolia), joined forces with Huo Qubing after arriving in time with 2,800 enemy kills, and the combined forces then returned in triumph. This victory earned Huo Qubing 5,800 households of fiefdom as a reward, making him more distinguished than his uncle Wei Qing. At the height of his career, many low-ranking commanders previously served under Wei Qing voluntarily transferred to Huo Qubing's service in the hope of achieving military glory with him.\n\nEmperor Wu offered to help Huo Qubing build up a household for marriage. Huo Qubing, however, answered that \"the Xiongnu are not yet eliminated, why should I start a family?\" (匈奴未滅，何以家為？), a statement that became an inspirational Chinese patriotic motto. Though Huo Qubing was recorded as a quietly spoken man of few words, he was far from humble. Sima Qian noted in \"Shiji\" that Huo Qubing paid little regard to his men, refusing to share his food with his soldiers, and regularly ordering his troops to conduct \"cuju\" games despite them being short on rations. When Emperor Wu suggested him to study \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu and \"Wuzi\" by Wu Qi, Huo Qubing claimed that he naturally understood war strategies and had no need to study. When his subordinate Li Gan (李敢, son of Li Guang) assaulted Wei Qing, the latter forgave the incident. Huo Qubing, on the other hand, refused to tolerate such disrespect towards his uncle and personally shot Li Gan during a hunting trip. Emperor Wu covered for Qubing, stating that Li Gan was \"killed by a deer\".\n\nWhen it came to military glory, Huo Qubing was said to be more generous. One story about him told of when Emperor Wu awarded Huo a jar of precious wine for his achievement, he poured it into a creek so all his men drinking the water could share a taste of it, giving the name to the city of Jiuquan (酒泉, literally \"wine spring\").\n\nHuo Qubing died in 117 BC at the early age of 24. After Huo Qubing's death, the aggrieved Emperor Wu ordered the elite troops from the five border commanderies to line up all the way from Chang'an to Maoling, where Huo Qubing's tomb was constructed in the shape of the Qilian Mountains to commemorate his military achievements. Huo Qubing was then posthumously appointed the title Marquess of Jinghuan (), and a large \"Horse Stomping Xiongnu\" () stone statue was built in front of his tomb, near Emperor Wu's tomb of Maoling.\n\nHuo Qubing was among the most decorated military commanders in Chinese history. The Eastern Han Dynasty historian Ban Gu, summarized in his \"Book of Han\" Huo Qubing's achievements with a poem:\nThe Champion of Piaoji, fast and brave.<br>Six long-distance assaults, like lightning and thunder.<br>Watering horse at Lake Baikal, conducting rituals at Khentii Mountains.<br>Conquering the area west of great river, establishing commanderies along Qilian Mountains.\n<br>票騎冠軍，猋勇紛紜，長驅六擧，電擊雷震，飲馬翰海，封狼居山，西規大河，列郡祁連。\n\nHuo Qubing's half-brother, Huo Guang, whom he took custody away from his father, was later a great statesman who was the chief counsel for Emperor Zhao, and was instrumental in the succession of Emperor Xuan to the throne after Emperor Zhao's death.\n\nHuo Qubing's son, Huo Shàn (), succeeded him as the Marquess of Jinghuan but died young in 110 BC. So Huo Qubing's title became extinct. His grandson Huo Shān (霍山, later Marquess of Leping) and Huo Yun (霍云, later Marquess of Guanyang) were involved in a failed plot to overthrow Emperor Xuan of Han in 66 BC, resulting in both of them committing suicide and the Huo clan being executed. It was presumably that no male descendant of Huo Qubing nor Huo Guang survived, as during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, it was Huo Yang, a great-grandson of Huo Qubing's paternal cousin, who was chosen as the descendant of Huo Guang to be the Marquess of Bolu.\n\nHuo Qubing is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI\" by Koei.\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Li Junfeng () in the popular 2005 historical epics TV series \"The Emperor in Han Dynasty\" ().\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Eddie Peng () under the name of Wei Wuji () in the popular romance Chinese drama \"Sound of the Desert\" () derived from the book Da Mo Yao/Ballad of the Desert () by famous novel writer Tong Hua.\n\nHuo Qubing is also mentioned in the blockbuster film \"Dragon Blade\", where the main character, played by Jackie Chan, is said to have been raised up by him. Actor Feng Shaofeng portrays the general in brief flashbacks.\n\n\n"}

Members in each category pay a fee to belong to the branch. Selected professional members of the branch are permitted to vote to decide the awards.\n\nThe 47th Annie Awards ceremony took place on January 25, 2020, on the campus of UCLA.\n\nIn 1972, June Foray first conceived the idea of awards for excellence in the field of animation. With the approval of ASIFA-Hollywood president Nick Bosustow, an Annie Award ceremony was organized. The first ceremony was held at the banquet room of Sportsmen's Lodge in Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer were the first to be honored by the first Annie Awards for creating the characters Betty Boop, Popeye, and Olive Oyl and for inventing the technique of rotoscoping.\n\nAccording to Foray, her husband Hobart Donavan suggested that the awards be called \"Annie\", because they are presented for excellence in animation.\n\nThe first trophy for the Annie Award trophy was presented in the second award ceremony, to Walter Lantz, the founder of Walter Lantz Productions and creator of Woody Woodpecker.

Official rules for the Annie Awards state that voting members must view all nominated achievements in their entirety before casting their ballot for a winner. Members are directed to view the nominated films on a secure website.\n\nWhen the online ballot launched on January 15, the two independent films were not included for voters to judge. ASIFA acknowledged this error over a week later, at which point all the votes were reportedly thrown out and the balloting system was reset. Voters were instructed to return and re-vote the category. \"The Chestnut Tree\" was now uploaded properly to the ballot, however \"Everything Will Be OK\" was again not included: this time, the online ballot only played a portion of this film's 17-minute running time to voters, abruptly cutting out in the middle of a scene. ASIFA again took several days to repair the ballot, but this time allowed voting to continue.\n\nBy the time the ballot officially closed on February 1, \"Everything Will Be OK\" was only available to voters for less than 24 hours of the entire 18-day voting period.

He was born in the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso in Segovia Province, and was consequently granted the non-substantive title of \"Duke of Segovia\", courtesy he held along with \"Duke of Anjou\" as the Legitimist pretender to the French throne. Jaime was a great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nBecause he was deaf, as the result of a childhood operation, he renounced his rights to the Spanish throne for himself and his descendants on 21 June/23 June 1933. He was then granted the title \"Duke of Segovia\" by King Alfonso XIII. After his father's death in 1941, he proclaimed himself the senior legitimate male heir of the House of Capet, heir to the French throne, and head of the House of Bourbon. He then took the title of \"Duke of Anjou\" and became, in the opinion of French legitimists, the \"de jure\" king of France as \"Henri VI\", though to a minority as \"Jacques II\" (after 1957, he signed all documents as \"Jacques Henri\").\n\nIn 1921, he became the 1,153rd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and Knight with Collar of the Order of Charles III and Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic both in 1925 (Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1931). Later in 1941, following the death of his father and his ascendance to the title of King of France, Jaime adopted the Order of the Holy Spirit as his own by his right to the French Throne. \nOn 4 March 1935, in Rome, Jaime married Victoire Jeanne \"Emmanuelle\" (Emanuela) Joséphine Pierre Marie de Dampierre (8 November 1913 in Rome – 3 May 2012 in Rome), daughter of Roger de Dampierre, 2nd Duque de San Lorenzo Nuovo, Vicomte de Dampierre (1892–1975) and of \"Donna\" Vittoria Ruspoli (1892–1982), daughter of Emanuele Ruspoli, 1st Principe di Poggio Suasa, and his third wife, English American Josephine Mary Curtis. Don Jaime and Donna Emanuela had two sons, named after Jaime's hemophiliac brothers, Alfonso and Gonzalo:\n\n\nDon Jaime and Emmanuelle de Dampierre divorced on 6 May 1947 in Bucharest (recognized by the Italian courts on 3 June 1949 in Turin but never recognized in Spain) and, on 3 August 1949 in Innsbruck, Don Jaime remarried civilly to divorced singer Charlotte Luise Auguste Tiedemann (2 January 1919 in Königsberg – 3 July 1979 in Berlin), daughter of Otto Eugen Tiedemann and wife Luise Amalia Klein. In the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church and of the French legitimists, Emmanuelle de Dampierre remained always his wife. The second marriage produced no children. His first wife remarried in Vienna, on 21 November 1949, to Antonio Sozzani (12 July 1918 in Milan – 6 January 2007 in Milan), son of Cesare Sozzani and wife Cristina Alemani, without issue.\n\nOn 6 December 1949, Don Jaime retracted his renunciation of the throne of Spain. On 3 May 1964, he took the title \"Duke of Madrid\" as head of a Carlist branch of the Spanish succession (recognized as King Jaime IV of Spain by the legitimist group of Carlists who did not support the Bourbon-Parma claim after Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime died in 1936). On 19 July 1969, Don Jaime definitively renounced the Spanish succession in favour of his nephew, the future King Juan Carlos I of Spain, at the request of his elder son, Alfonso de Borbón.\n\nDon Jaime died in St. Gall Cantonal Hospital in Switzerland on 20 March 1975. He is buried at the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Gladstone Park neighborhood of Chicago, at the intersection of Milwaukee, Devon, and Nagle Avenues. Superdawg has the distinction of being one of the few original drive-in restaurants left in the United States. Its methods have been the same since it opened in 1948. A second, similar location on Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling, Illinois opened in 2010.\n\nSuperdawg was featured on the Food Network's television programs \"Unwrapped\" and \"Emeril Live\", and on the PBS television programs \"Check, Please!\" and \"A Hot Dog Program\". It has been visited by many critics and food aficionados. It is listed in the books \"1,000 Places to See Before You Die\" and \"Hot Dog Chicago: A Native's Dining Guide\".\n\nSuperdawg was opened in May 1948 by Maurie and Flaurie Berman, and it is still owned and operated by their family. Although the restaurant has undergone some expansion and remodeling, the landmark figures of anthropomorphic hot dogs \"Maurie and Flaurie\" on the roof date from the beginning.\n\nIn 2003, a Superdawg location opened in Midway Airport's B concourse. It closed in 2010 when another Superdawg restaurant opened on Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling, Illinois.\n\nSuperdawg has succeeded in asking a number of restaurants to cease using similar names, but in 2009 successfully sued a New York City hot dog eatery named Superdog when it refused to comply. The Superdawg trademark was registered in 1984.\n\nIn 2014, Superdawg collaborated with Lake Effect Brewing Company, a Chicago craft brewery, to create a lager-style beer called Super Bier.\n\nMaurie Berman died on May 17, 2015. His wife Flaurie died May 1, 2018.\n\nIn June 2015, the Unicode Consortium added a hot dog to the list of officially recognized emoji. In September 2015, Apple made the symbol available on its phones and computers with the release of the iOS 9 operating system. Superdawg was a leader in the effort to establish the hot dog emoji.\n\nThe restaurant retains a 1950s style of ordering food. Customers pull their car up to one of the carports and order through a retro-looking metallic speaker box. Each cashier responds to the customer's call through the speaker box with the greeting, \"Hiya, thanks for stopping. May I take your order now?\" The orders are delivered to the car window by a carhop with a tray that hooks on to the half-open car window. When finished eating, the customer flips a switch on the box and a carhop comes to take the tray back. Many of the carhops have been there for years and have a loyal base of customers. There is also a walkup window and a small seating area inside the restaurant. The Wheeling location has a much larger indoor seating area.\n\nAll of the sandwiches come with crinkle-cut french fries inside a box that helps retain its heat. Every Superdawg comes with a signature pickled green tomato, one of Superdawg's distinctions from the classic Chicago-style hot dog, along with its spicier-than-usual wiener. They also sell double-cheeseburgers called \"Wooper-Cheezies\". Superdawg is also known to never put ketchup on any of their hot dogs. If customers ask for ketchup, it's provided on the side.\n\n"}

It is the capital of Nakuru County and former capital of the Rift Valley Province. Its population is 570,674 inhabitants according to the 2019 census, making it the largest urban centre in the Kenyan mid-west with Eldoret in Uasin Gishu following closely behind. Nakuru lies about 1,850 m above sea level.\n\nThe history of Nakuru can perhaps be traced to the prehistoric period due to the archaeological discoveries located about 8 km from the Central Business District at the Hyrax Hill reserve. Nakuru is Kenya's 4th largest urban centre with a population of 570,674. (The modern town, as with many others in Kenya, derives its name from the 'Maasai' speaking people of Kenya.) Nakuru was established by the British as part of the White highlands during the colonial era and it has continued growing into a cosmopolitan city. It received township status in 1904 and became a municipality in 1952.\n\nThe history of Kenya as a country is closely intertwined with that of Nakuru as a town and a district that is now a county. The first and second presidents of Kenya (Jomo Kenyatta, and Daniel Arap Moi) maintained their semi-official residences within the city. The city for a long time has been a hotbed of Kenyan politics and it was home to a variety of colourful politicians including the late Kariuki Chotara, Kihika Kimani and the late Mirugi Kariuki and Koigi Wamwere.\n\nIn 2006, the then MP, Mirugi Kariuki was killed in a plane crash in Marsabit on his way to a peace meeting. The crash also killed five other members of parliament. The ensuing by-election was contested and won by his son, William Kariuki Mirugi of the Narc-Kenya party. At the age of 27, Hon. William Kariuki Mirugi became one of the youngest members of parliament to represent Nakuru Town Constituency. He was however defeated by Lee Kinyanjui during the 2007 general elections beating his close rival Pastor Mike Brawan. The 2007 post-election violence also took a toll on the town, with dozens of buildings burnt to the ground by various factions.\n\nThe city of Nakuru is situated in Nakuru County, Kenya. It lies 1850 meters above sea levels on the highlands of Kenya giving it a climate similar, albeit a bit colder, to Nairobi.\n\nLike most rift valley cities, Nakuru enjoys a temperate climate throughout the year but temperatures fall significantly at night and during the cold season of June to August. The city has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification \"Csb\").\n\nIt is located along Kenyatta Avenue in Nakuru, Nakuru County, Kenya.\n\nAgriculture, manufacturing and tourism are the backbones of the economy of Nakuru. The area surrounding the city is known for its vast agricultural potential with numerous small farms and also vast agricultural enterprises. The main crops grown around Nakuru and marketed in the city include coffee, wheat, barley, maize, beans and potatoes.\n. These crops are stored in massive silos at the outskirts of the city by the National Cereals and Produce Board and Lesiolo Grain Handlers Limited. The crops provide the primary raw material for the manufacturing industries found in Nakuru and Nairobi. These industries include flour milling and grain ginneries. Dairy farming is a key economic activity and provides the inputs for various milk processing plants around the city.\n\nOther manufacturing industries include Menengai soap factory, Car&General Motorcycle plant, Eveready Battery plant, Fertiplant East Africa and many more.\n\nThe city also prides itself on being the home of Kenya's largest retail supermarket chains. Nakumatt, Naivas, Tuskys, and Gilanis supermarkets were all founded in the Nakuru.\n\nAccording to a UN study released in 2011, Nakuru is Africa's fastest-growing city and the fourth in the world.\n\nThe city is also a centre for various retail businesses that provide goods and services to the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. A large public market lies to the west of the town on the main thoroughfare to the capital, Nairobi.\n\nNakuru is also an important educational centre. It is the home of Egerton University, a large public university, and Kabarak University, a private university associated with former President Moi's business and religious interests. Molo Academy (both primary and secondary) school are located here) The Rift Valley Institute of Technology is also based here, as is the Kenya Industrial Training Institute (KITI). The Kenya Institute of Management (KIM) has a college branch in Nakuru. Nakuru is now becoming a centre of academics with campuses for the University of Nairobi, Kenyatta University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology, Mount Kenya University, Laikipia University, Kenya Methodist University being set up in the city. Other important institutions include The Institute of Advanced Studies, Kenya Institute of Biomedical Sciences and Technology (KIBSAT), Institute of Advanced Technology (IAT), Tracom College, AIRADS, Savannah Institute for Business and Informatics (SIBI) and most recent Nakuru Training Institute (NTI), which is a project of Nakuru Christian Professionals Association. The institute, popularly known as Centre of Hope trains youths at moderate fees and offers full sponsorship to the needy in the community. It partners with Nakurun Lapset (Finland) among others. Mwangaza College, initially called the Bishop Ndingi Centre for skills formation, is also another known college in Nakuru.\n\nNakuru is also a home to numerous public and private secondary schools. Public schools include Nakuru Boys High School and Nakuru Girls High School formerly Nakuru High School founded in 1926 as a school for European settler children, and Menengai High School and Nakuru day secondary school.\n\nThere is a well-stocked public library run by the Kenya National Library Service. The Library is along Moses Mudavadi road a short distance from the town centre. \nNakuru hospital is one of the largest in the county previously the biggest in Rift Valley province.\nIt is also home to the Nakuru War Memorial Hospital opened shortly after world war 1 by Norman Jewell to commemorate troops both African and European.\n\nNakuru is home to the Lanet Airstrip that was approved in 2017 for upgrade to an international airport by the ministry of Transport and county government.\n\nNakuru is also home to Kabarak Airstrip located 20 km away from the city center. \n\nDondori road C86 linking the city to central Kenya. The Eldoret-Nairobi highway passes through this city linking Uasin Gishu County with the capital Nairobi.\n\nThe Rift Valley Railways narrow gauge track runs through the city with a railway station located on the edge of the CBD. it connects to cities of Nairobi and Mombasa to the east and Kisumu and Eldoret to the west.\n\nThe government is currently extending the newer standard gauge railway from Nairobi to Nakuru and further on to Kisumu with a brand new station planned for the city. The railway line is expected to reach neighboring town Naivasha by June 2019\n\nNakuru is home to Lake Nakuru, one of the Rift Valley soda lakes, which forms part of the Lake Nakuru National Park. The park has large numbers of flamingoes that can be seen foraging in the shallow lake. The park also has many wild animals that can be seen during a safari. Apart from the animals, numerous other sites of interest are accessible from Nakuru. These include Menengai Crater, a dormant volcano. Small fumaroles and steam vents can regularly be observed within the forested caldera from above. The second largest surviving volcanic crater in the world, it plunges 483 m down from the rim and the summit is accessible by foot or vehicle 8 km from the main road to Nyahururu. The wood-covered crater ground is a nature reserve.\n\nAlthough Lake Bogoria and Lake Baringo are in Baringo County, they are easily accessible from Nakuru. These are major tourist attraction sites, too.\n\nHyrax Hill Prehistoric Site, discovered by the Leakeys in 1926, is considered a major Neolithic and Iron Age site. The adjoining museum features findings from various nearby excavations.\n\nThe food culture of Nakuru includes a variety of local and international cuisines.\n\nAfraha Stadium\n\nAfraha Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Nakuru, Kenya. It used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Nakuru AllStars of the Kenyan Premier League and Ulinzi Stars of the Kenyan Premier League. The stadium holds 8,200 people and opened in 1948. The stadium is two kilometres from the famous Lake Nakuru National Park. Even though it is a football stadium, it became famous for hosting many political meetings including the GEMA promoted change the constitution series held in the 1970s. The former ruling party KANU also held many prominent meetings there during the Moi era.\nNakuru also offers a great experience and opportunity for local skaters that are easily notable in the Maasai market area on weekends. The Maasai market also caters for Nakuru's growing skateboarding scene. \n\nThe Rift Valley Sports Club lies in the centre of the city. The club was started in 1907 by white European settlers who had settled in Nakuru in the early 1900s. A number of sporting activities are hosted at this club and popular among them is cricket. The local Indian community can be found at cricket fixtures throughout the year.\n\nThe city hosts an annual rugby festival dubbed \"The Great Rift 10-a-side\" which features teams from across the East Africa region. It is held at the Nakuru Athletics Club.\nIt is also one of six cities to host a leg of the national rugby sevens circuit, an extremely popular event held at the athletics club and attracting thousands of fans nationwide. Nakurus leg is referred to as the prinsloo sevens and its popularity and party atmosphere it brings to the city has contributed to Nakurus moniker as \"Nax Vegas\"\n\nA motor racing track, Nakuru Park, (not to be confused with the Langa Langa circuit near Gilgil) operated in the Lake View Estate area from 1956 until the mid 1980s.\n\nNakuru is populated by people from the whole of Kenya and from many regions of the world. The population is predominantly Kikuyu and Kalenjin but it has a cosmopolitan feel. The city has a sizable population of Kenyans of Indian origin and a few of the original settler families have also remained in the area. Kenya Population Census Nakuru had the fourth-largest urban population in Kenya.\n\nSurrounding towns include Lanet, which lies approximately 10 km from Nakuru, predominantly a residential town and home to the Moi Forces Academy and an army base. Njoro lies 20 km from Nakuru and is a small agricultural town with a local university aimed at promoting agricultural development in Kenya, namely Egerton University (est. 1934).\n\nNakuru is now the headquarters of the newly created Nakuru county in the Counties of Kenya.

{"id": "1903855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903855", "title": "Sensory substitution", "text": "Sensory substitution\n\nSensory substitution is a change of the characteristics of one sensory modality into stimuli of another sensory modality.\n\nA sensory substitution system consists of three parts: a sensor, a coupling system, and a stimulator. The sensor records stimuli and gives them to a coupling system which interprets these signals and transmits them to a stimulator. In case the sensor obtains signals of a kind not originally available to the bearer it is a case of sensory augmentation. Sensory substitution concerns human perception and the plasticity of the human brain; and therefore, allows us to study these aspects of neuroscience more through neuroimaging.\n\nSensory substitution systems may help people by restoring their ability to perceive certain defective sensory modality by using sensory information from a functioning sensory modality.\n\nThe idea of sensory substitution was introduced in the '80s by Paul Bach-y-Rita as a means of using one sensory modality, mainly taction, to gain environmental information to be used by another sensory modality, mainly vision. Thereafter, the entire field was discussed by Chaim-Meyer Scheff in \"Experimental model for the study of changes in the organization of human sensory information processing through the design and testing of non-invasive prosthetic devices for sensory impaired people\". The first sensory substitution system was developed by Bach-y-Rita et al. as a means of brain plasticity in congenitally blind individuals. After this historic invention, sensory substitution has been the basis of many studies investigating perceptive and cognitive neuroscience. Since then, sensory substitution has contributed to the study of brain function, human cognition and rehabilitation.\n\nWhen a person becomes blind or deaf they generally do not lose the ability to hear or see; they simply lose their ability to transmit the sensory signals from the periphery (retina for visions and cochlea for hearing) to brain. Since the vision processing pathways are still intact, a person who has lost the ability to retrieve data from the retina can still see subjective images by using data gathered from other sensory modalities such as touch or audition.\n\nIn a regular visual system, the data collected by the retina is converted into an electrical stimulus in the optic nerve and relayed to the brain, which re-creates the image and perceives it. Because it is the brain that is responsible for the final perception, sensory substitution is possible. During sensory substitution an intact sensory modality relays information to the visual perception areas of the brain so that the person can perceive sight. With sensory substitution, information gained from one sensory modality can reach brain structures physiologically related to other sensory modalities. Touch-to-visual sensory substitution transfers information from touch receptors to the visual cortex for interpretation and perception. For example, through fMRI, one can determine which parts of the brain are activated during sensory perception. In blind persons, it is seen that while they are only receiving tactile information, their visual cortex is also activated as they perceive \"sight\" objects. Touch-to-touch sensory substitution is also possible, wherein information from touch receptors of one region of the body can be used to perceive touch in another region. For example, in one experiment by Bach-y-Rita,touch perception was able to be restored in a patient who lost peripheral sensation due to leprosy.\n\nIn order to achieve sensory substitution and stimulate the brain without intact sensory organs to relay the information, machines can be used to do the signal transduction, rather than the sensory organs. This brain–machine interface collects external signals and transforms them into electrical signals for the brain to interpret. Generally, a camera or a microphone is used to collect visual or auditory stimuli that are used to replace lost sight and hearing, respectively. The visual or auditory data collected from the sensors is transformed into tactile stimuli that are then relayed to the brain for visual and auditory perception. This and all types of sensory substitution are only possible due to neuroplasticity.\n\n\"Brain plasticity\" refers to the brain's ability to adapt to a changing environment, for instance to the absence or deterioration of a sense. It is conceivable that cortical remapping or reorganization in response to the loss of one sense may be an evolutionary mechanism that allows people to adapt and compensate by using other senses better. Functional imaging of congenitally blind patients showed a cross-modal recruitment of the occipital cortex during perceptual tasks such as Braille reading, tactile perception, tactual object recognition, sound localization, and sound discrimination. This may suggest that blind people can use their occipital lobe, generally used for vision, to perceive objects through the use of other sensory modalities. This cross modal plasticity may explain the often described tendency of blind people to show enhanced ability in the other senses.\n\nWhile considering the physiological aspects of sensory substitution, it is essential to distinguish between sensing and perceiving. The general question posed by this differentiation is: Are blind people seeing or \"perceiving\" to see by putting together different sensory data? While sensation comes in one modality – visual, auditory, tactile etc. – perception due to sensory substitution is not one modality but a result of cross-modal interactions. It is therefore concluded that while sensory substitution for vision induces visual-like perception in \"sighted\" individuals, it induces auditory or tactile perception in \"blind\" individuals. In short, blind people \"perceive\" to see through touch and audition with sensory substitution.\n\nApplications are not restricted to handicapped persons, but also include artistic presentations, games, and augmented reality. Some examples are substitution of visual stimuli to audio or tactile, and of audio stimuli to tactile. Some of the most popular are probably Paul Bach-y-Rita's Tactile Vision Sensory Substitution (TVSS), developed with Carter Collins at Smith-Kettlewell Institute and Peter Meijer's Seeing with Sound approach (The vOICe). Technical developments, such as miniaturization and electrical stimulation help the advance of sensory substitution devices.\n\nIn sensory substitution systems, we generally have sensors that collect the data from the external environment. This data is then relayed to a coupling system that interprets and transduces the information and then replays it to a stimulator. This stimulator ultimately stimulates a functioning sensory modality. After training, people learn to use the information gained from this stimulation to experience a perception of the sensation they lack instead of the actually stimulated sensation. For example, a leprosy patient, whose perception of peripheral touch was restored, was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors coupled to skin sensory receptors on the forehead (which was stimulated). After training and acclimation, the patient was able to experience data from the glove as if it was originating in the fingertips while ignoring the sensations in the forehead.\n\nTo understand \"tactile sensory substitution\" it is essential to understand some basic physiology of the tactile receptors of the skin. There are five basic types of tactile receptors: Pacinian corpuscle, Meissner's corpuscle, Ruffini endings, Merkel nerve endings, and free nerve endings. These receptors are mainly characterized by which type of stimuli best activates them, and by their rate of adaptation to sustained stimuli. Because of the rapid adaptation of some of these receptors to sustained stimuli, those receptors require rapidly changing tactile stimulation systems in order to be optimally activated. Among all these mechanoreceptors Pacinian corpuscle offers the highest sensitivity to high frequency vibration starting from few 10s of Hz to a few kHz with the help of its specialized mechanotransduction mechanism.\n\nThere have been two different types of stimulators: electrotactile or vibrotactile. Electrotactile stimulators use direct electrical stimulation of the nerve ending in the skin to initiate the action potentials; the sensation triggered, burn, itch, pain, pressure etc. depends on the stimulating voltage. Vibrotactile stimulators use pressure and the properties of the mechanoreceptors of the skin to initiate action potentials. There are advantages and disadvantages for both these stimulation systems. With the electrotactile stimulating systems a lot of factors affect the sensation triggered: stimulating voltage, current, waveform, electrode size, material, contact force, skin location, thickness and hydration. Electrotactile stimulation may involve the direct stimulation of the nerves (percutaneous), or through the skin (transcutaneous). Percutaneous application causes additional distress to the patient, and is a major disadvantage of this approach. Furthermore, stimulation of the skin without insertion leads to the need for high voltage stimulation because of the high impedance of the dry skin, unless the tongue is used as a receptor, which requires only about 3% as much voltage. This latter technique is undergoing clinical trials for various applications, and been approved for assistance to the blind in the UK. Alternatively, the roof of the mouth has been proposed as another area where low currents can be felt.\n\nElectrostatic arrays are explored as human-computer interaction devices for touch screens. These are based on a phenomenon called electrovibration, which allows microamperre-level currents to be felt as roughness on a surface.\n\nVibrotactile systems use the properties of mechanoreceptors in the skin so they have fewer parameters that need to be monitored as compared to electrotactile stimulation. However, vibrotactile stimulation systems need to account for the rapid adaptation of the tactile sense.\n\nAnother important aspect of tactile sensory substitution systems is the location of the tactile stimulation. Tactile receptors are abundant on the fingertips, face, and tongue while sparse on the back, legs and arms. It is essential to take into account the spatial resolution of the receptor as it has a major effect on the resolution of the sensory substitution. A high resolution pin-arrayed display is able to present spatial information via tactile symbols, such as city maps and obstacle maps.\n\nBelow you can find some descriptions of current tactile substitution systems.\n\nOne of the earliest and most well known form of sensory substitution devices was Paul Bach-y-Rita's TVSS that converted the image from a video camera into a tactile image and coupled it to the tactile receptors on the back of his blind subject. Recently, several new systems have been developed that interface the tactile image to tactile receptors on different areas of the body such as the on the chest, brow, fingertip, abdomen, and forehead. The tactile image is produced by hundreds of activators placed on the person. The activators are solenoids of one millimeter diameter. In experiments, blind (or blindfolded) subjects equipped with the TVSS can learn to detect shapes and to orient themselves. In the case of simple geometric shapes, it took around 50 trials to achieve 100 percent correct recognition. To identify objects in different orientations requires several hours of learning.\n\nA system using the tongue as the human-machine interface is most practical. The tongue-machine interface is both protected by the closed mouth and the saliva in the mouth provides a good electrolytic environment that ensures good electrode contact. Results from a study by Bach-y-Rita et al. show that electrotactile stimulation of the tongue required 3% of the voltage required to stimulate the finger. Also, since it is more practical to wear an orthodontic retainer holding the stimulation system than an apparatus strapped to other parts of the body, the tongue-machine interface is more popular among TVSS systems.\n\nThis tongue TVSS system works by delivering electrotactile stimuli to the dorsum of the tongue via a flexible electrode array placed in the mouth. This electrode array is connected to a Tongue Display Unit [TDU] via a ribbon cable passing out of the mouth. A video camera records a picture, transfers it to the TDU for conversion into a tactile image. The tactile image is then projected onto the tongue via the ribbon cable where the tongue's receptors pick up the signal. After training, subjects are able to associate certain types of stimuli to certain types of visual images. In this way, tactile sensation can be used for visual perception.\n\nSensory substitutions have also been successful with the emergence of wearable haptic actuators like vibrotactile motors, solenoids, peltier diodes, etc. At the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing at Arizona State University, researchers have developed technologies that enable people who are blind to perceive social situational information using wearable vibrotactile belts (Haptic Belt) and gloves (VibroGlove). Both technologies use miniature cameras that are mounted on a pair of glasses worn by the user who is blind. The Haptic Belt provides vibrations that convey the direction and distance at which a person is standing in front of a user, while the VibroGlove uses spatio-temporal mapping of vibration patterns to convey facial expressions of the interaction partner. Alternatively, it has been shown that even very simple cues indicating the presence or absence of obstacles (through small vibration modules located at strategic places in the body) can be useful for navigation, gait stabilization and reduced anxiety when evolving in an unknown space. This approach, called the \"Haptic Radar\" has been studied since 2005 by researchers at the University of Tokyo in collaboration with the University of Rio de Janeiro. Similar products include the Eyeronman vest and belt, and the forehead retina system.\n\nNeuroscientist David Eagleman presented a new device for sound-to-touch hearing at TED in 2015; his laboratory research then expanded into a company based in Palo Alto, California, called Neosensory. Neosensory devices capture sound and turn them into high-dimensional patterns of touch on the skin.\n\nExperiments by Schurmann et al. show that tactile senses can activate the human auditory cortex. Currently vibrotactile stimuli can be used to facilitate hearing in normal and hearing-impaired people. To test for the auditory areas activated by touch, Schurmann et al. tested subjects while stimulating their fingers and palms with vibration bursts and their fingertips with tactile pressure. They found that tactile stimulation of the fingers lead to activation of the auditory belt area, which suggests that there is a relationship between audition and tactition. Therefore, future research can be done to investigate the likelihood of a tactile–auditory sensory substitution system. One promising invention is the 'Sense organs synthesizer' which aims at delivering a normal hearing range of nine octaves via 216 electrodes to sequential touch nerve zones, next to the spine.\n\nSome people with balance disorders or adverse reactions to antibiotics suffer from bilateral vestibular damage (BVD). They experience difficulty maintaining posture, unstable gait, and oscillopsia. Tyler et al. studied the restitution of postural control through a tactile for vestibular sensory substitution. Because BVD patients cannot integrate visual and tactile cues, they have a lot of difficulty standing. Using a head-mounted accelerometer and a brain-machine interface that employs electrotactile stimulation on the tongue, information about head-body orientation was relayed to the patient so that a new source of data is available to orient themselves and maintain good posture.\n\nTouch to touch sensory substitution is where information from touch receptors of one region can be used to perceive touch in another. For example, in one experiment by Bach-y-Rita, the touch perception was restored in a patient who lost peripheral sensation from leprosy. For example, this leprosy patient was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors coupled to skin sensory receptors on the forehead (which was stimulated). After training and acclimation, the patient was able to experience data from the glove as if it was originating in the fingertips while ignoring the sensations in the forehead. After two days of training one of the leprosy subjects reported \"the wonderful sensation of touching his wife, which he had been unable to experience for 20 years.\"\n\nThe development of new technologies has now made it plausible to provide patients with prosthetic arms with tactile and kinesthetic sensibilities. While this is not purely a sensory substitution system, it uses the same principles to restore perception of senses. Some tactile feedback methods of restoring a perception of touch to amputees would be direct or micro stimulation of the tactile nerve afferents.\n\nOther applications of sensory substitution systems can be seen in function robotic prostheses for patients with high level quadriplegia. These robotic arms have several mechanisms of slip detection, vibration and texture detection that they relay to the patient through feedback. After more research and development, the information from these arms can be used by patients to perceive that they are holding and manipulating objects while their robotic arm actually accomplishes the task.\n\nAuditory sensory substitution systems like the tactile sensory substitution systems aim to use one sensory modality to compensate for the lack of another in order to gain a perception of one that is lacking. With auditory sensory substitution, visual or tactile sensors detect and store information about the external environment. This information is then transformed by interfaces into sound. Most systems are auditory-vision substitutions aimed at using the sense of hearing to convey visual information to the blind.\n\n\"The vOICe\" converts live camera views from a video camera into soundscapes, patterns of scores of different tones at different volumes and pitches emitted simultaneously. The technology of the vOICe was invented in the 1990s by Peter Meijer and uses general video to audio mapping by associating height to pitch and brightness with loudness in a left-to-right scan of any video frame.\n\nThe EyeMusic user wears a miniature camera connected to a small computer (or smartphone) and stereo headphones. The images are converted into \"soundscapes\". The high locations on the image are projected as high-pitched musical notes on a pentatonic scale, and low vertical locations as low-pitched musical notes. \n\nThe EyeMusic conveys color information by using different musical instruments for each of the following five colors: white, blue, red, green, yellow. The EyeMusic employs an intermediate resolution of 30×50 pixels. \n\nThis project, presented in 2015, proposes a new versatile mobile device and a sonification method specifically designed to the pedestrian locomotion of the visually impaired. It sonifies in real-time spatial information from a video stream acquired at a standard frame rate. The device is composed of a miniature camera integrated into a glasses frame which is connected to a battery-powered minicomputer worn around the neck with a strap. The audio signal is transmitted to the user via running headphones. This system has two operating modes. With the first mode, when the user is static, only the edges of the moving objects are sonified. With the second mode, when the user is moving, the edges of both static and moving objects are sonified. Thus, the video stream is simplified by extracting only the edges of objects that can become dangerous obstacles. The system enables the localization of moving objects, the estimation of trajectories, and the detection of approaching objects.\n\nAnother successful visual-to-auditory sensory substitution device is the Prosthesis Substituting Vision for Audition (PSVA). This system utilizes a head-mounted TV camera that allows real-time, online translation of visual patterns into sound. While the patient moves around, the device captures visual frames at a high frequency and generates the corresponding complex sounds that allow recognition. Visual stimuli are transduced into auditory stimuli with the use of a system that uses pixel to frequency relationship and couples a rough model of the human retina with an inverse model of the cochlea.\n\nThe sound produced by this software is a mixture of sinusoidal sounds produced by virtual \"sources\", corresponding each to a \"receptive field\" in the image. Each receptive field is a set of localized pixels. The sound's amplitude is determined by the mean luminosity of the pixels of the corresponding receptive field. The frequency and the inter-aural disparity are determined by the center of gravity of the co-ordinates of the receptive field's pixels in the image (see \"There is something out there: distal attribution in sensory substitution, twenty years later\"; Auvray M., Hanneton S., Lenay C., O'Regan K. Journal of Integrative Neuroscience 4 (2005) 505-21). The Vibe is an Open Source project hosted by Sourceforge.\n\nOther approaches to the substitution of hearing for vision use binaural directional cues, much as natural human echolocation does. An example of the latter approach is the \"SeeHear\" chip from Caltech.\n\nOther visual-auditory substitution devices deviate from the vOICe's greyscale mapping of images. Zach Capalbo's Kromophone uses a basic color spectrum correlating to different sounds and timbres to give users perceptual information beyond the vOICe's capabilities.\n\nBy means of stimulating electrodes implanted into the human nervous system, it is possible to apply current pulses to be learned and reliably recognized by the recipient. It has been shown successfully in experimentation, by Kevin Warwick, that signals can be employed from force/touch indicators on a robot hand as a means of communication.\n\nIt has been argued that the term \"substitution\" is misleading, as it is merely an \"addition\" or \"supplementation\" not a substitution of a sensory modality.\n\nBuilding upon the research conducted on sensory substitution, investigations into the possibility of \"augmenting\" the body's sensory apparatus are now beginning. The intention is to extend the body's ability to sense aspects of the environment that are not normally perceivable by the body in its natural state.\n\nActive work in this direction is being conducted by, among others, the e-sense project of the Open University and Edinburgh University, and the feelSpace project of the University of Osnabrück.\n\nThe findings of research into sensory augmentation (as well as sensory substitution in general) that investigate the emergence of perceptual experience (qualia) from the activity of neurons have implications for the understanding of consciousness.\n\n\n"}

The original EP initially featured only four tracks and was released in the UK in June 1978 and never published in the US. \"Snakebite\" was re-released in September 1978 as a Double Extended Play containing four extra studio tracks taken from David Coverdale's second solo album \"Northwinds\". The EP sleeve is entitled \"David Coverdale's Whitesnake\" and features photographs of the live band in concert. All tracks from the original EP also were used as bonus tracks on the 2006 remaster of Whitesnake's debut studio album \"Trouble\".\n\nShortly after producing and then touring in support of \"Northwinds\", Coverdale found that his new band was already producing and testing new material. Thus they returned to the studio to capture this newfound energy.\n\nThe resulting mini-album (\"Snakebite\" EP) features the cover song \"Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City\", originally performed by Bobby Bland. Although it is now considered a classic Whitesnake song, according to Coverdale it wasn't planned that way: \"Originally I had no plans to actually record ‘Ain’t No Love in the Heart of the City’… if you can you believe it… a song that connects so deeply with so many that I still play it today, 25 years later.\"\n\nSome of the songs from this album would be captured later in 1978 and released on the 1980 \"Live...In the Heart of the City\" live album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1903859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903859", "title": "New York State Route 13", "text": "New York State Route 13\n\nNew York State Route 13 (NY 13) is a state highway that runs mainly north–south for between NY 14 in Horseheads and NY 3 west of Pulaski in Central New York in the United States. In between, NY 13 intersects with Interstate 81 (I-81) in Cortland and Pulaski and meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Canastota. NY 13 is co-signed with several routes along its routing, most notably NY 34 and NY 96 between Newfield and Ithaca; NY 80 between DeRuyter and Cazenovia; and NY 5 between Chittenango and Canastota.\n\nThe most heavily traveled section of the route is the northeast–southwest section between Horseheads and Cortland. Situated midway between the two locations is the city of Ithaca; here, a small section of NY 13 follows an expressway alignment around much of the city. Much of the route, however, is a two-lane highway that passes through rural areas. When NY 13 was originally assigned in the 1920s, it extended only from Elmira to Cazenovia. It was significantly extended in 1930, stretching from Lindley in the south to Richland in the north. The southern terminus was moved back to Elmira in the 1940s and has been located at various points in the city since then.\n\nUp until 2006, NY 13 began at exit 54 on the Southern Tier Expressway (NY 17) southeast of the village of Horseheads. However, as part of the Horseheads Bypass project, NY 13 was extended west into the village to NY 14 along the frontage roads for the expressway. North of NY 17, NY 13 heads north through the town of Horseheads, paralleling the eastern edge of the village to an intersection with NY 223 near the northern town line. As NY 13 passes out of Horseheads and into Veteran, the amount of development along the roadway becomes sparse, consisting of only small roadside hamlets.\n\nJust before exiting Chemung County, NY 13 turns northeast toward the city of Ithaca several miles to the northeast. The route soon enters the narrow southeastern extents of Schuyler County, where it intersects NY 224 before crossing county lines again, this time into Tompkins County. In the town of Newfield, NY 13 remains largely rural in nature, passing only one significant settlement—the Newfield hamlet of the same name, officially known as Newfield Hamlet—on its way to the town of Ithaca. Shortly after entering the town, the route meets with the concurrent routes of NY 34 and NY 96 at an interchange adjacent to Robert H. Treman State Park, becoming Elmira Road. Both routes join NY 13 north alongside the eastern edge of the park to NY 327, a road largely delimiting the northern extent of the park. The three routes proceed generally northeastward through the town of Ithaca to the vicinity of Buttermilk Falls State Park, where they intersect the south end of NY 13A, an alternate route of NY 13 through western Ithaca, near the former Tutelo village of Coreogonel at the confluence of Buttermilk Creek and the Cayuga Lake inlet. NY 13, NY 34, and NY 96 continue on, directly serving Buttermilk Falls State Park as they pass over the creek and inlet and enter the Ithaca city limits.\n\nAt West Clinton Street (NY 96B), the route splits into a one-way pair, with Meadow Street carrying northbound traffic and Fulton Street handling southbound traffic. Due to the configuration of the city street grid, NY 79 overlaps the three-route concurrency on Fulton Street for one block eastbound as it switches from West State Street to West Green Street; no such overlap exists westbound/northbound as NY 79 westbound remains on West Seneca Street, where NY 96 leaves NY 13/34 and joins NY 79. The one-way pair comes to an end near Hancock Street, at which point both directions of the route merge into Meadow Street and continue northeastward through the city as an at-grade roadway. At Dey Street, however, the road becomes a limited-access highway as it heads through the northern extents of the city and partially alongside Cayuga Lake.\n\nNear the northern city line, the roadway connects to East Shore Drive by way of an interchange, at which point NY 34 leaves the expressway to follow East Shore Drive along the lakeshore. NY 13 and NY 34 follow parallel routings into Lansing, where NY 13 curves eastward to interchange with both Cayuga Heights Road and Triphammer Road. Southwest of Ithaca Tompkins International Airport, NY 13 downgrades into a divided highway and meets Warren Road at-grade before reverting into a two-lane roadway as it passes south of the airport and exits the Ithaca area.\n\nNY 13 progresses southeast through western Dryden to meet Dryden Road (NY 366), a street originating in eastern Ithaca. NY 366 joins NY 13 northeast along Fall Creek for little more than before splitting; however, the Dryden Road name remains with NY 13 into the village of Dryden. At the village center, NY 13 meets both NY 38 and NY 392. NY 13 turns north, overlapping NY 38 for three blocks and passing Tompkins Cortland Community College as it exits the village limits on Cortland Road.\nAt the Tompkins-Cortland County line, NY 13 loses the Cortland Road moniker and becomes unnamed as it heads toward Cortland. Southwest of the city limits, NY 13 breaks to the northeast, with its north-northeastward alignment continuing onward as NY 281. In Cortland, NY 13 becomes Tompkins Street and meets NY 215 (Owego Street) three blocks from an intersection with the overlapping routes of U.S. Route 11 (US 11) and NY 41 at Church Street. All three routes turn north onto Church, creating a three-route overlap that lasts for three blocks through downtown Cortland. At Clinton Road, US 11 and NY 41 turn west while NY 13 curves east for several blocks to an interchange with I-81 at the northeastern edge of the city's downtown district. Here, the Tioughnioga River splits, with NY 13 following the eastern branch northeast out of the Cortland city limits.\n\nNY 13 continues northeast along the banks of the Tioughnioga through Truxton, where it intersects the southern terminus of NY 91, to the hamlet of Cuyler in the town of the same name. Here, the river downgrades to a creek as the route turns eastward toward Madison County. Upon crossing the county line, NY 13 enters the village of DeRuyter, located in the town of the same name, as Cortland Street. In the village center, NY 13 turns left onto Utica Street and follows the roadway out of the village.\n\nOutside of the village, NY 13 follows a largely northeast–southwest alignment as it passes through the hamlet of Puckerville (centered around the junction between NY 13 and East Lake Road, a local roadway following the eastern edge of the DeRuyter Reservoir), to Sheds, a small hamlet marked by the intersection of NY 13 and NY 80. NY 13 turns north, overlapping NY 80 north for to the Cazenovia community of New Woodstock, where NY 13 leaves NY 80 at the western fringe of the hamlet.\n\nNY 13 heads north to the village of Cazenovia, located at the southeastern tip of Cazenovia Lake. Within the village limits, NY 13 overlaps US 20 on Forman and Albany Streets before continuing north out of the village on Farnham and Sweetland Streets. Outside of the village, the street becomes known as Gorge Road and enters a roughly ravine surrounding the Chittenango Creek. As NY 13 progresses northward, the gorge deepens, reaching approximately within Chittenango Falls State Park. North of the park, the gorge widens laterally and continues to drop in elevation, with the difference between the surrounding terrain and NY 13 reaching almost as it intersects NY 5 in southeastern Chittenango. The two routes overlap, following Genesee Street north for several blocks before turning east and paralleling the former Erie Canal out of the village.\n\nThe two routes remain conjoined until Canastota, a village located in the town of Lenox, where NY 13 breaks from NY 5 and resumes its northward progression. North of the village center, NY 13 meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit 34 before exiting Canastota. At the southeastern corner of Oneida Lake, NY 13 intersects NY 31. Just north of NY 31, NY 13 crosses over the Oneida River and enters Oneida County.\n\nBetween the county line and NY 49, NY 13 follows the eastern edge of Oneida Lake as it proceeds northward through the towns of Verona and Vienna. In Verona, NY 13 passes through the center of Verona Beach State Park and serves the lakeside community of Verona Beach, located adjacent to where the Erie Canal exits Oneida Lake. NY 13 crosses over the canal shortly afterward, passing into the Vienna community of Sylvan Beach in the process. Development along NY 13 continues as far north as Edgewater Beach, where NY 13 breaks from the lakeshore and continues north to meet NY 49. NY 13 turns east, overlapping NY 49 into the hamlet of Vienna.\n\nIn the center of Vienna, NY 13 leaves NY 49 and continues northward through the hamlet of McConnellsville (where NY 13 is joined by the west branch of Fish Creek) to the village of Camden, where NY 69 overlaps NY 13 for two blocks through the heart of the village. Past Camden, NY 13 continues northwest along Fish Creek into the Oswego County town of Williamstown, where NY 13 leaves the waterway and intersects NY 183 and NY 104.\n\nNY 13 continues onward through rural central Oswego County to the village of Pulaski, which is in the town of Richland, where the route connects to southbound I-81 by way of a half-interchange just outside the village and intersects US 11 near the center of Pulaski. The route continues west for another before terminating at NY 3 in the hamlet of Port Ontario, which is also in the town of Richland.\n\nWhen state highways in New York were first publicly signed in 1924, NY 13 was assigned only to the portion of its modern routing between Elmira and Cazenovia. Within the Elmira area, NY 13 initially followed a different routing, beginning at the intersection of Lake Street and Water Street (then NY 17) on the north bank of the Chemung River in downtown Elmira. The route then overlapped NY 14 along Lake Street to Horseheads, where NY 13 split from NY 14 and headed northeast on Old Ithaca Road to what is now the intersection between NY 13 and NY 223. Here, NY 13 turned north, following its current alignment toward Ithaca.\n\nIn the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 13 was extended over previously unnumbered roadways on both ends of its alignment, but unlike most routes in the state, it retained the same number along its original route. To the south, NY 13 was extended along Water Street (modern NY 352) to West Elmira, and on what is now NY 225 west to Caton. Past Caton, NY 13 continued west to NY 2 (now US 15) in Lindley by way of Tannery Creek Road, River Road, and Morgan Creek Road (collectively modern County Route 120). In the north, NY 13 was extended northward along its modern routing to NY 3C (modern NY 3) west of Pulaski. By 1940, the portion of NY 13 between Horseheads and Elmira became part of a realigned NY 17.\n\nThe portion of NY 13 west of Elmira was removed from the state highway system in the early 1940s. NY 13 was truncated back to its original terminus at Water Street in downtown Elmira even though all of NY 13 south of Horseheads was concurrent with NY 17. NY 17 was moved onto its current alignment east of the city in the late 1950s; NY 13 was realigned south of NY 223 to follow a new road leading to a newly constructed interchange with NY 17.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Sullivanville Dam project forced a portion of the route to be rerouted northeast of Horseheads. Due to the elevated water level caused by the dam, the route had to be moved to higher ground west of the hamlet of Sullivanville in the Town of Veteran. A section of the old highway remains under the impounded water. Another section north of the dam exists as an extension of Sullivanville Road.\n\nIn 2007, with the completion of the I-86 project, NY 13 was extended westward along the parallel collector/distributor roads to NY 14 in Horseheads. Prior to the project's completion, at least one \"NY 13 south\" sign assembly was exposed along the westbound frontage road leading from exit 54 (NY 13). Several similarly shaped signs on similar sign assemblies were covered along the route.\n\nWhen NY 13 was first assigned, it entered the city of Ithaca on Spencer Road and followed Spencer and Cayuga Streets into downtown. From there, NY 13 proceeded generally northeastward on Court and Linn Streets, University Avenue, and Forest Home Drive through the Cornell University campus to Dryden Road, where it turned eastward toward Dryden. NY 13 was realigned to bypass the Cornell University grounds to the south on State (NY 79) and Mitchell Streets and Ithaca and Dryden Roads. Its old alignment through the college became NY 392.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a new expressway was built along the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake, bypassing downtown Ithaca on the west and north. NY 13 was altered to follow Meadow Street and the freeway between southwestern Ithaca and the town of Dryden while the portion of NY 13's old routing that did not overlap NY 79 became an extension of NY 366. The new expressway was pictured on the Voyager Golden Record as an example of a \"modern highway.\" In 1996, ten blocks of southbound NY 13 was diverted from Meadow Street to Fulton Street as part of the Octopus elimination project.\n\nNY 13A is a north–south spur that bypasses downtown Ithaca by way of the town of Ithaca to the southwest.

{"id": "1903875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903875", "title": "Manele", "text": "Manele\n\nManele (from Romanian, \"fem.\" \"sg.\" manea; \"pl.\" manele, the plural form being more common) is a genre of pop folk music from Romania.\n\nThe manele can be divided into \"classical manele\" and \"modern manele\". The \"classical manele\" are a Turkish-derived genre performed by lăutari in a lăutărească manner, while the \"modern manele\" are a mixture of Turkish, Greek, Arabic, Bulgarian and Serbian elements, generally using modern (electronic) instruments and beats.\n\nSimilar music styles are also present in other Balkan areas, like Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia, Greece and Turkey and with expatriates and emigrants originally from these regions. Related genres are Bulgarian \"Chalga\" (manele brought by Romanian visitors to Bulgaria is referred to as \"Romanian chalga\"), Greek modern \"Skiladiko\" and Serbian \"Turbo-folk\", each one being a mixture of local folk Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian influences over a pop tune.\n\nEarly references to the terms \"manea\" and \"manele\" appear in Romanian texts from the late 18th and early 19th century, during the period of Turkish suzerainty over the Romanian principalities, as a genre of dance music brought by Phanariotes from Istanbul. This dance had no text. Some of these classical manele have been adapted during the ages.\n\nIn the 1960s a type of lăutarească manea appeared, by adding texts to the geampara, a type of lăutaresc genre of Turkish origin.\n\nThe modern manele originated in the 1980s and early 1990s as underground translations and imitations of Turkish and Arabic songs. A well known Romanian manele singer, Adrian Copilul Minune traces it to a genre known as \"turceasca\" (Turkish), .\n\nThe genre has been rocked by accusations of plagiarism a number of times, with manele singers adapting popular songs from Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, without giving due credit. The accusations increased especially after the hit \"De ce mă minţi\" (\"Why are you lying to me?\") proved to be a mere cover of Despina Vandi's song \"M'agapas\"/\"Ah kardoula mou\". Further plagiarism accusations surrounded a well known manele singer's track called \"Supărat\"(\"Upset\") which was proven by third parties to be plagiarized from a Croatian song (Umoran by Jasmin Stavros). Although this song was not technically a manea, it furthered the controversy surrounding this music genre and Romania's image. Most radio and television channels or media boycott manele music.\n\nManele is a mixture of \"oriental\" Romanian folk and contemporary pop music with bases on Balkan influences The lyrics usually refer to themes of love, enemies, money, alcoholism and difficulties of life in general, or some of the songs are specifically dedicated to parties, weddings, funerals, etc. Manele style contains objections to music primitiveness and low performance.\n\nManele are widely criticized for their lyrical content, which often consists of boasts about the singer's supposed sex appeal, intellect, wealth, social status, and superiority over so-called \"enemies\". Many singers use bad grammar, repetitive and simplistic rhymes suitable for chanting and are sometimes vulgar and/or misogynistic. Singers sometimes make trilling or yelling sounds during instrumental parts of their songs, an aspect that has been parodied many times.\n\nSome manele also have music videos, of which many are of poor quality while others are recorded in nightclubs or during private parties.\n\nManele composers and players also use the term \"oriental music\" or \"party music\" for their creation, and consider their music a sub-genre of traditional, folk Roma music.\n\nTraditional Roma music is usually played on classical instruments by a live band (taraf) of lăutari and has classical lyrics, while manele is usually sung by only one performer using modern instruments (generally synthesizers) as backup. Most manele are recorded in small recording studios, owned by the singer himself or by a group of singers, since major recording labels refuse to contract them. However, there are some exceptions: for example, Stana Izbaşa and Nicu Paleru sing live, often with traditional instruments.\n\nThe word \"manea\" is of Turkish origin: \"mâni\" is a form of Turkish folk song, in form of quatrains. The word \"manea\" is the singular form and it refers to the musical piece itself, as belonging to Manele genre. The accent is on the second syllable: manéa.\n\nThe plural version, more commonly used, manele, refers to:\n\nThe adjective form of the word is \"manelist\", which is sometimes used in Romanian with a pejorative figurative form.\n\nManelists have created a distinct image on the Romanian music scene, by showing their own fashion style. Many of the manelists use luxurious and casual, even underground styles combined altogether to form the specific manele fashion. Typical manele apparel includes flashy jewelry and affordable luxury clothing brands (such as Versace, Armani or Dolce & Gabbana) or certain sport brands (especially Nike). Such brands are an important part of manele culture, and they are even featured sometimes in lyrics. .\n\nManele are a strongly disputed genre in Romania, with many representatives of Romanian upper-middle and intellectual class opposing this \"musical\" movement (and its popularization) mostly because of its usage of faulty grammar, overly simplistic or childish lyrics and subject matter and/or encouragement of demeaning behaviours towards other people, as well as an antisocial overall message. The fact that manele lyrics are considered by many to be rude and of poor taste, coupled with widespread racist feelings against Roma ethnics (Țigani/Gypsies), who account for the bulk of manele performers, has led to increasing hostility between fans and opponents. This has generated frequent conflicts between the two, often in the form of internet flame wars.\n\nIn the media, manele have been repeatedly called by journalists and academics (such as the literary critic George Pruteanu) \"pseudo-music\", \"pure stupidity, inculture and blah-blah\" or even \"society's bed-wetter\". C. Tepercea, a National Audio-visual Board member who did a study on the genre for the board considered it \"the genre for the mentally challenged\" in an interview. Even proposals to ban this type of music have been voiced.\n\nRomani-Romanian classical musician and politician Mădălin Voicu distinguishes between the original genre and today's interpreters, calling their work \"kitsch and bad taste\", \"bad merchandise, easy to sing, and only sold to fools at a high price\", but considers them to be \"harmful\", \"simple music and brain damaging\", \"a representation of the lack of musical culture in society\" and \"a fad that is poised to vanish in the future\".\n\nRomanian-American professor Cezar Giosan further compares the genre in an article in \"Dilema Veche\" with the early stages of rock-and-roll (and Elvis), early rap and reggaeton, music starting out from the outcast classes of society, being shunned by the higher classes for the simple reason of its origin, only to explode into mainstream later on. The same professor considers the genre as being a form of originality coming from below, with the singers having a genuine (albeit rough and uneducated) talent in music, with the lyrics being just a reflection of basic, simple human needs. In a similar vein, Sorin Adam Matei, an associate professor of communication at Purdue University, US, affirmed in an opinion piece for \"Evenimentul Zilei\" that manele are a creole genre, a simple, but lively music, spawned by the meeting of many cultures, that has a chance to succeed as a cultural style if it is polished and \"cleaned up\". Both consider that manele is a valuable representation of Romanian popular culture, and would like it encouraged. Famous Romani-Romanian violin player Florin Niculescu said that manele singers are talented, but lack musical education.\n\nOn Romanian television stations, manele performers and music are particularly seen on specialized manele television stations, such as Taraf TV or Manele TV. While mainstream radio stations do not air manele, a lot of smaller stations do, especially in Romania's capital, Bucharest. Occasionally, manele interpreters appear on New Year's Eve programs on television stations.\n\nManele have been prohibited in some cities of Romania in public transport, taxis or festivals.\n\n\n\n\nPopular performers include Florin Salam, Nicolae Guță, Vali Vijelie, Sandu Ciorba, and DeSanto.\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium was founded at Kantō Mura, the redevelopment area formerly used by United States Forces Japan, in March 2001. It was the first stadium in Japan that offered its naming rights, which were sold to Ajinomoto Co., Inc. with a 5-year 1.2 billion yen (about 10 million U.S. dollars) contract, from March 2003 to February 2008. As a result, it was named . This contract was renewed in November 2007 and extended by 6 years for 1.4 billion yen to February 2014, and in October 2013, the second renewal of the contract extended the term to February 2019.\n\nThe stadium is the home of J1 League football club FC Tokyo and J2 League football club Tokyo Verdy and is used as the venue of some lower divisions of football leagues. Rugby union games are also held there. For the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Saudi Arabia's national team based their training camp at Chōfu and used the stadium as a main training ground, although it did not host an actual World Cup match.\n\nThe stadium is often used for non-sport events, such as concerts and flea markets. It has been used as a shelter for survivors of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The stadium is one of the planned football venues for the 2020 Summer Olympics. During the Olympics, the stadium will be known as Tokyo Stadium due to International Olympic Committee's non-commercialization policy. The stadium has also been one of the venues for 2019 Rugby World Cup and hosted the opening ceremony, followed by the opening match of the tournament, as well as other 7 matches including Bronze Final.\n\nThe north end of the stadium adjoins the Chofu Airport, while Route 20 runs close to the south end. At the south end is the main gate, which is directly connected by a pedestrian bridge over Route 20.\n\nThe stand accommodates 49,970 and is divided into two levels; the upper level accommodates 20,600 and the lower level 29,370 (both are all-seated). On each level, the stand is divided into four sections (main, back, north and south sides).\n\nThe whole of the upper level, as well as upper tiers of the lower level, is covered by roof, which is made of Teflon (main and back) and polycarbonate (both sides). The main stand houses media and hospitality boxes, VIP rooms and reception hall. Two large LED displays are installed at both sides.\n\nThe ground was originally designed for both athletics and football games. However, the construction of the supplementary ground, which is needed for compliance with 1st-grade athletic grounds in Japan, has been postponed. The management company has decided to use the ground mainly for football, and not to install a running track until the supplementary pitch has been added. Currently artificial turf is laid down all over the ground except the football field area, over which natural turf is spread. Consequently, there is some room between the football pitch and the stand.\n\nIn 2013, the athletics track was finally installed in order to host the National Sports Festival of Japan at the same year. However, the artificial turf is still used over the track for football matches.\n\nIn order to comply with height limitation close to the airport, the pitch is sunk below the level of the land around the stadium.\n\n"}
{"id": "1903884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903884", "title": "Fighting Vipers", "text": "Fighting Vipers\n\nFighting Vipers (ファイティングバイパーズ\" Faitingu Vaipāzu\") is a 3D fighting video game developed by Sega AM2. It uses the same game engine as AM2's \"Virtua Fighter 2\" but features enclosed arenas and an armor mechanic, and was targeted more towards Western audiences, using a U.S. setting and more freeform styles of martial arts. The game was released in the arcade in 1995 using the Sega Model 2 hardware, and became one of the highest grossing arcade games of 1996. The game was ported to the Sega Saturn, and to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in 2012. Though \"Fighting Vipers\" was not very popular in arcades, the Saturn version was one of the most high-profile games in the system's 1996 holiday lineup, and was met with positive reviews.\n\n\"Fighting Vipers\" features a similar style of gameplay to Sega AM2's more renowned \"Virtua Fighter\" series, specifically \"Virtua Fighter 2\", using simply guard, punch and kick attack buttons with a focus on combo moves. The Saturn version uses its three extra buttons for three smaller combos.\n\nEach of the 9 characters featured in the game wears armor that can be broken off by opponents, leaving them more vulnerable to taking damage. A human shaped meter in the top corners of the screen monitors damage to the armor. Walls surround each arena, caging the combatants in, allowing for attacks in conjunction with them (bouncing off etc.). If a knockout attack is strong enough, characters can knock their opponent over, on top, or straight through the walls.\n\nThe Saturn port of \"Fighting Vipers\" added Playback Mode and Training Mode, both of which are now used widely in the genre, by games such as \"Tekken\" and \"Soulcalibur\". Players could save their matches and play them again in Playback Mode, while Training Mode talked the player through the moves of each character one-by-one.\n\nBahn: despite only being a 17-year-old high school student from Nishino Machi, Bahn is a powerful and imposing fighter in a long coat and hat. He has come overseas to find and fight his father, whom he has never met and abandoned him and his mother when he was a boy. He has declared himself 'Gengis Bahn III'. His design was inspired by the character Jotaro Kujo from \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\".\n\nCandy (or Honey): a petite 16-year-old fashion student with a pleasant nature, Candy designed her own trademark plastic fairy costume herself, and has entered the tournament to promote her original fashion line. Takara, a Japanese toy company, made three dolls of this character.\n\nGrace: a 19-year-old African-American born in Armstone City whose armor is themed after the protective gear for inline skating, including the skates themselves. Grace is making her living as a fashion model. Though she once dreamed of becoming a professional figure skater, her lover and coach betrayed her, leaving her disillusioned.\n\nRaxel: the narcissistic lead singer and guitarist for a hair metal band called 'Death Crunch' with KISS-styled armor and carrying a red Gibson Flying-V electric guitar, Raxel is the son of an Armstone City councilman, a drop out who left home after a fight with his father. Raxel has simply entered the tournament to heighten his own profile and become more famous.\n\nTokio: a 16-year-old pretty boy rebelling against a strict kabuki actor's household. Tokio is a former leader of a street gang called 'Black Thunder' but left after feeling responsible for another gangmember's death. He has entered the tournament for a challenge and for thrills.\n\nSanman: a mysterious fat man about whom nothing is known, other than his birthday (3 March) and an obsession with the number 3, hence his name (\"san\" is Japanese for \"three\"). Sanman drives a large customized scooter.\n\nJane: a butch and muscled 18-year-old part-time construction worker, Jane trained her whole life to join the Navy, but did not make it past training. She was discharged after repeatedly losing control of herself during fights and injuring fellow seamen. Jane now wants to test just how tough she is, hence entering the Fighting Vipers tournament. Her design is heavily inspired by Private Vasquez from the film \"Aliens\".\n\nPicky: a 14-year-old stereotypical skateboarder Picky's armour is styled after protective gear for skateboarders. He carries his skateboard on his back, and hits opponents with it. Picky began skateboarding to impress his first love, but later on he left her for Candy.\n\nMahler: the unlockable ninth character, Mahler is a mysterious 20-year-old with a grudge against the Mayor of Armstone City (who has organised the tournament) wearing poisonous armor resembling a snake. He isn't officially registered as a member of the tournament.\n\nB.M.: the boss of the game and the man who organised the tournament, B.M. is a powered-up version of Mahler. Both Mahler and B.M.'s names may have been inspired by musician Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who was known in America as the \"Big Mahler\".\n\nKumachan: a 10-year-old smiling bear character wearing an orange hat, who is included as an unlockable character in the Sega Saturn port. It is based on the giant floating balloon mascot seen in the Old Armstone Town stage. It uses Sanman's fighting style, and its 2nd player counterpart is called Pandachan. Uniquely, even though it can fight, its 3D model never moves.\n\nPepsiman: the Japanese mascot of Pepsi who only appears in the Japanese Sega Saturn version of the game as an unlockable character. He was removed from the US and PAL releases.\n\n\"Fighting Vipers\" was developed using the same game engine which was first used for \"Virtua Fighter 2\", and uses a nearly identical arcade board, though with slightly faster processing speed. Unlike \"Virtua Fighter 2\", there are no ring-outs; producer Yu Suzuki stated, \"We received comments about the ring-outs in \"VF\" and so for \"FV\" the fighting can continue mercilessly.\"\n\nThe character Mahler was created by reducing the power specifications of the boss, B.M., so that he would be appropriately balanced for player vs. player matches.\n\nA demo of the game was displayed at the 1995 JAMMA show with all eight characters playable, though they did not yet have all their moves available.\n\nThe Saturn conversion, like the arcade original, was developed by Sega AM2. The programming team consisted of 15 people, most of whom had worked on the Saturn version of \"Virtua Fighter 2\", and some of whom had worked on the arcade version of \"Fighting Vipers\". Work on the conversion began in the first quarter of 1996 and took eight months. After converting the \"Virtua Fighter 2\" engine, the team focused first on recreating the barriers, as they anticipated this would be the most difficult part to accomplish on the Saturn hardware. Because armor and walls can be broken in the game, there was no easy way of reducing the number of polygons in those elements. In part to compensate for the lower polygon counts on the characters, a new form of dynamic lighting incorporating Gouraud shading was added to the Saturn version. In order to make this effect possible, and have the game run at a speed comparable to the arcade version, the team decided at the beginning of development that they would not use the Saturn's high-resolution mode.\n\n\nReviewing the arcade version, a \"Next Generation\" critic called \"Fighting Vipers\" \"a beautiful, highly polished, polygon-rendered and texture-mapped game featuring brand new characters, unprecedented closed-in arenas (for a 3D fighter), a slightly different set of fighting strategies using armor, and a more cinematic style of viewing.\" He also praised the more intuitive button combinations used to execute moves. Despite this, he concluded that the game fails to measure up to recent fighting games, chiefly due to the \"strained\" character designs: \"Raxel, Jane, Picky, Sanman are undeniably trendy and conclusively uncool ... They lack the artful, graceful movements of \"VF2\"s Lau, Sarah, or Pai.\"\n\nIn reviews for the Saturn version, the barrier mechanics - allowing players to beat opponents against or through walls and use them to launch attacks - were met with universal approval. Most were also enthusiastic about being able to break off an opponent's armor for extra damage, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi-X of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" felt the amount of flesh exposed when a fighter's armor is broken off amounted to cheap lewdness. While some complained of reduced polygon counts and occasional slowdown compared to the arcade version, the conversion to the Saturn as a whole was well-regarded, with critics especially praising its retention of the arcade version's smooth animation, its use of light sourcing, and the Saturn-exclusive features. \"GameSpot\" concluded, \"If you have a Saturn, this is the fighting game to own. If you don't, \"Fighting Vipers\" gives you a good reason to get one.\" Scary Larry of \"GamePro\" said it \"is one of our favorites because it's fast, sexy, and easy.\" And while most critics felt that \"Fighting Vipers\" clearly falls short of \"Virtua Fighter 2\", Rich Leadbetter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" said it \"is far more of a gratifying experience to the average gamer than VF or its sequel\" and a \"Next Generation\" reviewer concluded, \"\"VF2\" is one of the best games of all time, but \"Fighting Vipers\" nearly eclipses it.\"\n\nA sequel, \"Fighting Vipers 2\" was released, introducing new characters (Emi, a computer geek who fights with a self-developed mecha armor, and Charlie, a BMX rider - also some bonus ones, like Del Sol, a Mexican wrestler with a Sun mask, and Kuhn, a Dural exact copycat) and was ported to the Dreamcast but only in Japan and Europe.\n\nAll of the \"Fighting Vipers\" characters were used in Sega AM2's \"Fighters Megamix\" for the Sega Saturn. \"Fighting Vipers\" was also re-released for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages line. A PAL version was planned, but never released.\n\n\"Fighting Vipers\" was re-released in late 2012 on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live as one of five games included in the Sega Model 2 Collection. The re-release features online play, but does not contain any of the extra content found in the Saturn version. \"Fighting Vipers\" is also included as a playable arcade game in \"Judgment\".\n\nBahn appears as a solo unit in \"Project X Zone\", an 3DS' RPG crossover of Capcom, Sega and Namco Bandai Games.\n\nA programmer working on \"Fighting Vipers\" put Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails in the game for amusement, which led to Sega AM2 commissioning a \"Sonic\" fighting game, \"Sonic the Fighters\". Hidden within the data of the arcade version of \"Sonic the Fighters\" is an additional character named Honey, a yellow cat wearing Candy's red plastic fairy costume. She was only playable by hacking the game's data. Honey's model was removed from the \"Sonic the Fighters\" port on \"Sonic Gems Collection\". However, in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 port, she is a playable character, and was later introduced to the cast of Archie Comics' \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" comics during an arc based on \"Sonic the Fighters.\" The arc depicted Honey as a fashion designer similar to her human counterpart, and also featured a boar character based on Jane.\n\n"}

Best known for production of yellow school buses, the company produces buses for multiple applications; all bodies designed by the company have been produced for cutaway van chassis.\n\nCollins was founded in 1967 by Don Collins, Sr. as E-CON-O Conversion; originally a part of Collins Industries, the company exists today as a wholly owned subsidiary of manufacturing company REV Group. All production is sourced from a 94,000 square-foot facility from South Hutchinson, Kansas.\n\nIn 1967, Don Collins founded E-CON-O Conversion in Kansas City, Missouri, becoming one of the first to develop a school bus derived from a van. Utilizing a Ford Falcon van (Econoline passenger van), Collins shifted away from designs based upon utility vehicles such as the Chevrolet Suburban and International Harvester Travelall.\n\nIn 1971, Collins replaced E-CON-O with Collins Industries, expanding its product range into ambulances. In 1972, the company was relocated to Hutchinson, Kansas (its present-day location).\n\nIn 1982, Collins introduced its first bus with a wheelchair lift; in a shift away from van conversions, the company adopted bodies for cutaway van chassis, introducing the long-running \"Bantam\" product line. In the mid-1980s, the company would diversify its product ranges. To replace the Collins van-based ambulances, the company acquired Wheeled Coach Industries in 1984 (inventor of the modular ambulance) and Capacity of Texas (a terminal tractor manufacturer) in 1985.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Collins Industries grew to become the largest manufacturer of Type A small school buses in the United States. In 1998, the company would acquire its largest competitor, Mid Bus (a successor of the bus manufacturing operations of Superior Coach Company). To expand into the transit bus segment, Collins acquired World Trans, Inc, basing their vehicles on cutaway chassis and rear-engine chassis.\n\nIn 2000, the company purchased Waldon Manufacturing, renaming it after its Lay-Mor street sweeper.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the existence of Collins would transition significantly, shifting from a parent company to a subsidiary within a transportation conglomerate. Although specializing solely in small buses, in 2000, Collins offered the widest product line of any American bus manufacturer, with three different versions of the Bantam.\n\nA publicly traded company since 1983, Collins Industries became privately held in October 2006. 80 percent of the company was acquired by BNS Holding Inc, with the investment group American Industrial Partners holding the other 20 percent.\n\nIn 2007, Collins purchased the assets of Quebec-based manufacturer out of bankruptcy. As with its Mid Bus acquisition a decade before, Collins shifted production of Corbeil buses to its Kansas facility, repackaging it as a product range marketed in Canada. Both subsidiaries adopted the Bantam bodywork, marketed as the Mid Bus Guide and Corbeil Quantum, respectively.\n\nIn 2010, American Industrial Partners formed Allied Specialty Vehicles out of four of its transportation holdings, including Collins and its subsidiary companies. Under ASV, Collins was part of a conglomerate including fire/emergency vehicles, recreational vehicles, transit and school buses, and industrial vehicles. In 2015, Allied Specialty Vehicles was renamed the REV Group.\n\nOn March 29, 2012, Collins unveiled the Nexbus series, replacing the long-running Bantam series; the first Nexbus was produced on May 16, 2012. In place of the former Guide and Quantum, all three Collins brands adopted Nexbus branding. In 2014, collins starting manufactured the Nexbus using the Ford Transit 350/350HD chassis. By 2016, Collins retired the Mid Bus and Corbeil brands entirely, using the Collins brand across North America.\n\nFor 2018, Collins introduced the Collins Low Floor variant of the Nexbus body.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is the property of the Republic of Italy, and has been directed and run by the Polo Museale del Lazio since December 2014.\n\nThe villa was constructed at Tibur (modern-day Tivoli) as a retreat from Rome for Roman Emperor Hadrian during the second and third decades of the 2nd century AD. Hadrian is said to have disliked the palace on the Palatine Hill in Rome, leading to the construction of the retreat. It was traditional that the Roman emperor had constructed a villa as a place to relax from everyday life. Previous emperors and Romans with wealth, such as Trajan, had also constructed villas. Many villas were also self-sustaining with small farms and did not need to import food.\n\nThe picturesque landscape around Tibur had made the area a popular choice for villas and rural retreats. It was reputedly popular with people from the Spanish peninsula who were residents in the city of Rome. This may have contributed to Hadrian's choice of the property – although born in Rome, his parents came from Spain and he may have been familiar with the area during his early life.\n\nThere may also have been a connection through his wife Vibia Sabina (83–136/137) who was the niece of the Emperor Trajan. Sabina's family held large landholdings and it is speculated the Tibur property may have been one of them. A villa from the Republican era formed the basis for Hadrian's establishment.\n\nDuring the later years of his reign, Hadrian actually governed the empire from the villa. Hadrian started using the villa as his official residence around AD 128. A large court therefore lived there permanently and large numbers of visitors and bureaucrats would have to have been entertained and temporarily housed on site. The postal service kept it in contact with Rome away, where the various government departments were located.\n\nIt isn't known if Hadrian's wife lived at the villa either on a temporary or permanent basis – his relations with her were apparently rather strained or distant, possibly due to his ambiguous sexuality. Hadrian's parents had died when he was young, and he and his sister were adopted by Trajan. It is possible that Hadrian's court at the villa was predominately male but it's likely that his childhood nurse Germana, to whom he had formed a deep attachment, was probably accommodated there (she actually outlived him).\n\nAfter Hadrian, the villa was occasionally used by his various successors (busts of Antoninus Pius (138–161), Marcus Aurelius (161–180), Lucius Verus (161–169), Septimius Severus and Caracalla have been found on the premises). Zenobia, the deposed queen of Palmyra, possibly lived here in the 270s.\n\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, the villa gradually fell into disuse and was partially ruined as valuable statues and marble were taken away. The facility was used as a warehouse by both sides during the destructive Gothic War (535–554) between the Ostrogoths and Byzantines. Remains of lime kilns have been found, where marble from the complex was burned to extract lime for building material.\n\nIn the 16th century, Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este had much of the remaining marble and statues in Hadrian's Villa removed to decorate his own Villa d'Este located nearby. Since that period excavations have sporadically turned up more fragments and sculptures, some of which have been kept in situ or housed on site in the display buildings.\n\nHadrian's Villa is a vast area of land with many pools, baths, fountains and classical Greek and Roman architecture set in what would have been a mixture of landscaped gardens, wilderness areas and cultivated farmlands.\n\nThe buildings are constructed in travertine, brick, lime, pozzolana, and tufa. The complex contains over 30 buildings, covering at least a square kilometre (250 acres, an area larger than the city of Pompeii), of which much is still unexcavated. Villas were typically sited on hilltops, but with its fountains, pools and gardens, Hadrian's villa required abundant sources water, which was supplied by aqueducts feeding Rome, including the Aqua Anio Vetus, Aqua Anio Novus, Aqua Marcia, and Aqua Claudia. To avail themselves of those sources, the villa had to be located on land lower than the aqueduct.\n\nThe complex of the villa contains many structures from different cultures. For example, the villa has a small Nile river running through it that relates back to the Egyptian Nile river. Also, the villa had Poikilos, which are Greek figures that were seen in ancient Greece. Within all the structures in the villa, there is also a grotto called Hades. All these structures relate back to where Emperor Hadrian visited during his reign.\n\nThe architecture goes beyond the mere naming of its structures naming after places and monuments seen by Hadrian on his extensive travels across the empire. Certain buildings clearly attempt to recreate specific features of landscapes or architecture that had personal significance for the emperor. Thus, the area known as the Canopus, named after the Egyptian city where Antinous drowned, features a long, stately reflecting pool, representing the Nile, which was lined with copies of famous works of sculpture including the caryatids of the Erechtheion, a statue depicting the Egyptian dwarf and fertility god, Bes and a crocodile. The Pecile is modeled after the Stoa Poikile in Athens, a city favored by Hadrian. The structures freely mix traditional Greek and innovative Roman elements. The island enclosure (known as the Maritime Theatre) uses the classical Ionic order, albeit in a novel way; the triclinium of the so-called Piazza d’Oro and the Serapeum were covered with Roman segmented concrete domes, probably designed by Hadrian himself.\n\nHadrian's Pecile located inside the Villa was a huge garden surrounded by a swimming pool and an arcade. The pool's dimensions measure . Originally, the pool was surrounded by four walls with colonnaded interior. These columns helped to support the roof. In the center of the quadriportico was a large rectangular pool. The four walls create a peaceful solitude for Hadrian and guests.\n\nOne structure in the villa is the so-called \"Maritime Theatre\". It consists of a round portico with a barrel vault supported by pillars. Inside the portico was a ring-shaped pool with a central island. The large circular enclosure in diameter has an entrance to the north. Inside the outer wall and surrounding the moat are a ring of unfluted ionic columns. The Maritime Theater includes a lounge, a library, heated baths, three suites with heated floors, washbasin, an art gallery, and a large fountain. During the ancient times, the island was connected to the portico by two wooden drawbridges. On the island sits a small Roman house complete with an atrium, a library, a triclinium, and small baths. The area was probably used by the emperor as a retreat from the busy life at the court.\n\nThe villa utilizes numerous architectural styles and innovations. The domes of the steam baths have circular holes on the apex to allow steam to escape. This is reminiscent of the Pantheon, also built by Hadrian. The area has a network of tunnels and were mostly used to transport servants and goods from one area to another.\n\nIn 1998, the remains of what archaeologists claimed to be the monumental tomb of Antinous, or a temple to him, were discovered at the Villa. This, however, has subsequently been challenged in a study noting the lack of any direct evidence for a tomb of Antinous, as well as a previously overlooked patristic source indicating burial in Egypt at Antinoöpolis, and treating the possibility of a sanctuary of Antinous at Hadrian's Villa as plausible but unproven.\nIn September 2013, a network of tunnels was investigated, buried deep beneath the villa – these were probably service routes for staff so that the idyllic nature of the landscape might remain undisturbed. The site housed several thousand people including staff, visitors, servants and slaves. Although much major activity would have been engaged in during Hadrian's absence on tours of inspection of the provinces a great many people (and animals) must have been moving about the Tivoli site on a daily basis. The almost constant building activity on top of basic gardening and domestic activities probably led to subterranean routes being resorted to.\n\nThe villa itself has been described as an architectural masterpiece. A team of caving specialists has discovered that it is even more impressive than previously thought.\n\nMany beautiful artifacts have been unearthed and restored at the Villa, such as marble statues of Antinous, Hadrian's deified lover, accidentally drowned in Egypt, and mosaics from the theatre and baths.\n\nA lifelike mosaic depicted a group of doves around a bowl, with one drinking, seems to be a copy of a work by Sosus of Pergamon as described by Pliny the Elder. It has in turn been widely copied.\n\nMany copies of Greek statues (such as the Wounded Amazon) have been found, and even Egyptian-style interpretations of Roman gods and vice versa. Most of these have been taken to Rome for preservation and restoration, and can be seen at the Musei Capitolini or the Musei Vaticani. However, many were also excavated in the 18th century by antiquities dealers such as Piranesi and Gavin Hamilton to sell to Grand Tourists and antiquarians such as Charles Towneley, and so are in major antiquities collections elsewhere in Europe and North America.\n\nArtworks found in the villa include:\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Hadrian's Villa as a World Heritage Site in 1999. The designation specified the boundaries of the site and created a buffer zone around it in which no new construction was permitted. In 2011, the communal government of Tivoli announced plans, later cancelled, to build a waste dump in the vicinity of the villa and approved the construction of public housing on 120,000 sq. meters within the buffer zone. At its 36th Annual Meeting, UNESCO formally addressed these encroachments on the site. While they commended the Italian government for its decision to abandon the construction of a waste dump in the Corcolle area, the committee requested the government “to inform the World Heritage Centre in due time about any major development project planned in the buffer zone of the property, including the housing development at Comprensorio di Ponte Lucano, for which a Heritage Impact Assessment should be included, in accordance with Paragraph 172 of the Operational Guidelines, before any irreversible commitment is made.” UNESCO also requested “the State Party to submit . . . an updated report on the state of conservation of the property,” by February 2014, reflecting concerns over the deterioration of the exposed ruins.\n\nIn 2016, as part of the reorganization of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Hadrian's Villa, the neighboring Villa d’Este and the Temple of Hercules in Tivoli were placed under the supervision of the newly-created Istituto Autonomo di Villa Adriana.\n\nThe Accademia Adrianea di Architettura ed Archeologia1 issued a call for papers for a conference titled Designing the UNESCO Buffer Aobe.\n\nThe Academy of the villa was placed on the 100 Most Endangered Sites 2006 list of the World Monuments Watch because of the rapid deterioration of the ruins.\n\nIn 2019, UNESCO designated Hadrian's Villa as a site with special immunity from wartime activity. This added level of security prohibits U.N. members from attacking the site or using it for military purposes in the event of a war.\n\n\n\n"}

Most of these releases were exclusive to Japan. Three games in the Sega Saturn series - \"Space Harrier\", \"Out Run\"' and \"After Burner II\" - were selected for \"Sega Ages Vol. 1\", released in Europe in 1996 and in North America in 1997. Several games in the PlayStation 2 series were released in Europe and North America as part of the \"Sega Classics Collection\" compilation in 2005. The PlayStation 2 series was initially developed by 3D Ages, a collaborative effort between Sega and D3 Publisher, however Sega would soon develop the games in-house following the departure of D3 Publisher from the project. \n\nThe first \"Sega Ages\" series was released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn in Japan and concluded in 1998. Although the majority of the titles in this series remained exclusive to Japan, three games from the line - \"Out Run\", \"Space Harrier\" and \"After Burner II\", would be compiled into the video game compilation \"Sega Ages Vol. 1\", released in Europe in 1996 by Sega itself and in North America in 1997 by Working Designs under their \"Spaz\" imprint. Despite the title, no additional volumes would be released in these territories.\n\nThe second series was released for the PlayStation in 2003 and concluding in 2008, known as the \"Sega Ages 2500\" series - this title comes from the ¥2500 price point the game had. The series was created from Sega's interest in the success of D3 Publisher's \"Simple\" budget-title video game series, which features low-budget games at a low price point. This interest would lead to Sega and D3 Publisher forming a new subsidiary company in 2003, known as , with the sole reason to create games under the \"Sega Ages 2500\" series. Later in 2004, D3 Publisher would leave the project and give Sega complete control of the company.\n\nThe main focus of the series was to remake older Sega video games with 3D visuals, alongside improved sound and gameplay. Following the departure of D3 Publisher, the series would soon shift into featuring compilations of other Sega video games alongside remakes of these games. The series officially concluded in 2008 after 33 entries, although several other \"Sega Ages 2500\" games, featuring games such as \"Streets of Rage\", \"Alex Kidd\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", were planned for release. 3D Ages was disbanded in late 2005 and absorbed into Sega.\n\nDue to complications with Sony Computer Entertainment America, Sega was disallowed from releasing the games individually outside Japan. Instead, nine of the games in the \"Sega Ages 2500\" series would be compiled into the \"Sega Classics Collection\" compilation for the PlayStation 2, released in North America by Sega in 2005 and in Europe by Conspiracy Entertainment in 2006.\n\nThe third series was released for the Xbox 360 that was both introduced and concluded in 2012. This series consisted of releases from the \"Sega Vintage Collection\" series, originally released in North America and Europe, as well as re-releases of games from the \"Sega Ages 2500\" series - the latter games were only released on the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 and had the \"Sega Ages 2500\" name stripped from the title. The games were developed by M2 as opposed to being made in-house by Sega. Ten releases were made in total, making it the shortest of the \"Sega Ages\" series.\n\nThe fourth \"Sega Ages\" series is currently being released for the Nintendo Switch, available through the Nintendo eShop storefront. This series is being developed by M2, with lead producer Rieko Kodama from Sega. It was first announced in August 2018, with ten titles announced for the series. Sega has since stated that games from the Sega Saturn and Dreamcast would be made available later on.\n\nThe first \"Sega Ages\" volume was a best-seller in the United Kingdom. \"Next Generation\" rated it three stars out of five, saying it \"holds up better than the \"Namco Museum\" series, and at a mere $40, these three games should be worth giving the ol' CD a spin.\" \"GamePro\" gave it a negative review, saying that the three games in the collection \"were never all that good to begin with. ... They all have their strong points, but lack those special qualities that make certain games forever great.\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" unanimously contended that the three included games were outstanding and praised their arcade-perfect recreations, though they felt the collection should have included more games and historical info, as other retro compilations of the time did. They gave it a 6.5 out of 10. \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" gave it a 91%, likewise praising the three included games and the quality of the conversions. Though they criticized that \"After Burner\" and \"Space Harrier\" were somewhat wasted since they had already received excellent ports for the Mega Drive and 32X, they felt the compilation was worth getting for \"Out Run\" alone.\n\n\n"}

He was capped by both the England U21 and England B sides.\n\nLukic signed for Leeds United as a schoolboy. He made his debut for the Elland Road side in 1979 and went on to play 165 games for them. After making a transfer request, Lukic moved to Arsenal in July 1983 for £75,000, as a long-term replacement for Pat Jennings. By the middle of the 1984–85 season he was the club's No. 1, and won the League Cup in 1987 and the Division One title in 1989. He was ever present in Arsenal's first team throughout seasons 1987–88, 1988–89 and 1989–90. Lukic played in the final game of the 1989 season, where Arsenal won the title in the last minute of the game against Liverpool, with Lukic starting the move which led to Michael Thomas's famous goal.\n\nIn the summer of 1990 Arsenal manager George Graham signed David Seaman from Queens Park Rangers – Seaman had been Lukic's understudy at Leeds. This outraged many Arsenal fans at the time, especially as Lukic was a fan favourite. On his departure, Graham commented \"I still think John Lukic is one of the best keepers in the country; I just think David Seaman is the best\". Having played 277 times for the Gunners, Lukic rejoined Leeds for £1million, playing a further 265 times and winning a second League title in 1991–92 and a runners up medal in the League Cup in 1995–96.\n\nLukic was displaced at Leeds by the signing of Nigel Martyn, and in 1996 he returned for a second spell at Arsenal. As deputy to David Seaman, he played 15 league games in 1996–97 as cover, but after the signing of Alex Manninger in 1997 he stepped down to No. 3. However, with Manninger injured, Lukic was on the bench for Arsenal's 2000 UEFA Cup Final loss to Galatasaray, earning him a runners-up medal.\n\nIn 2000, after a series of injuries to the club's other 'keepers, he made a brief return to the first team, playing four times. The last of these four games, against Derby County, was a month shy of his 40th birthday; another one of these, a match against Lazio on 17 October 2000 made him, at the time, the oldest player ever to take part in a UEFA Champions League match. This has since been surpassed by Dany Verlinden, Alessandro Costacurta and Marco Ballotta. He retired in 2001 and now coaches part-time. He has won the league with two different clubs, a feat he shares with fellow professionals such as Nicolas Anelka, Eric Cantona, Carlos Tevez, Ashley Cole, and Kevin Richardson. He is one of possibly four players to have played in the top flight of English football in four separate decades, the other players to attain this achievement are Peter Shilton, Steve Ogrizovic and Stanley Matthews.\n\nThough Lukic played for England at youth and under-21 level, he never won a cap for the senior team. He was once considered for selection to the Yugoslav national side (due to his Yugoslavian parentage) in the late eighties but he declined the offer.\n\nLukic was born in Chesterfield to Yugoslavian parents; an urban legend states that Lukic's mother survived the Munich air disaster while pregnant with him; this is untrue, as the crash happened in February 1958, more than two years before Lukic was born. There was a Mrs Lukić on board the plane, who did survive (along with her young daughter) after being saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg.\n\nLukic has a son, also called John and also a goalkeeper, who was a youth player on the books of Nottingham Forest until 2005 when he was snubbed a professional contract, however he signed professional terms with Grimsby Town in June 2005 to act as understudy to Steve Mildenhall for the 2005–06 season. However, he was released at the end of the season and briefly signed for Barnsley before disappearing from competitive football.

The congregation is most notable for their international missionary works in China, Mongolia, the Philippines and in Congo Free State/Belgian Congo, modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nPresently, their international name \"CICM Missionaries\" is preferred, although, in the United States of America, the congregation is mostly known as Missionhurst.\n\nVerbist was a diocesan priest in the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels in the mid-19th century. He served as chaplain to the military academy in Brussels and at the same time as a national director of the Pontifical Association of the Holy Childhood. A compassionate man of God, he led a group of other Belgian diocesan priests who became deeply concerned with the abandoned children in China and with millions of Chinese who lived at that time in ignorance and poverty. The congregation is named after a religious Marian devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and has sought to expand its missionary work in various countries abroad.\n\nVerbist's desire to consecrate himself to the life of a missionary seemed on the point of fulfillment when the Treaty of Peking of 1861 opened imperial China to his zeal and that of the little band who desired to accompany him. In 1862 he founded the Belgian Mission in China. On seeking ecclesiastical permission, however, they were commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Barnabò, Prefect of the Propaganda Fide, to begin their work by founding a seminary in Belgium to supply priests for the beginning mission, and laid the foundations of the Scheutveld College, 28 April 1863, in the Field of Scheut, a short distance from Brussels, so the C.I.C.M. missionaries were also known as \"Scheutists\" or \"Scheut missionaries\".\n\nThe congregation was born not knowing exactly what lay ahead. In September 1863, the first group of missionaries set forth for Inner Mongolia. In the winter of 1865, Verbist and his four companions arrived in inner Mongolia, which was entrusted to the fledgling congregation by Rome, and where they immediately began organizing small Christian communities. The founding Fathers never imagined that many would follow their footsteps notwithstanding the cost of traveling by sea and in the hinterlands of China. Three years later on February 23, 1868, Verbist died of typhoid fever at the age of 45 in Lao-Hu-Kou.\n\nAfter World War I Belgium lay devastated and the Missionary Fathers of Scheut decided to establish a centre in a safe location from which they could send out their missionaries. As many Belgian refugees at that time were living in London it was thought that a church in that city would serve the spiritual needs of the Belgian community of London and also become a base for the Order's missionary activities. In 1922 the Church of Our Lady of Hal was established in a hut on Arlington Road in Camden Town while a permanent church was built opposite this site in 1933.\n\nDuring World War II, Father Jozef Raskin, ordained in the congregation in 1910, and during the 1920-1930's was a missionary to Inner Mongolia, was made a chaplain in the Belgium army and was a personal advisor to King Leopold III. While he was operating under the codename Leopold Vindictive 200 for the Dutch resistance in 1942, he was captured by the Gestapo, tried, convicted, then sentenced to death and beheaded on October 18, 1943.\n\nHis foundation, however, grew into the worldwide presence it is today. Originally a Belgian Foundation, CICM has grown into an international religious missionary congregation of men from different races, colors and nationalities who are dedicated to universal brotherhood.\n\nThe Scheutveld priests and brothers have faced severe perils, e.g. the Boxer rebellion in China, involving the massacre of Bishop Hamer, Vicar Apostolic of South-Western Mongolia, seven missionaries and 3000 Christians; the even greater decimation of their numbers by the Congo climate, not to mention the persecution of the missionaries and their local congregations.\n\nIn connection with their missions the Fathers opened a number of benevolent institutions, for example the hospital at St-Trudon, Upper Kassai, for those afflicted with sleeping sickness.\n\nToday, 900 CICM priests and lay brothers are present in Asia: in Taiwan, Mongolia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia and Japan; in the vast continent of Africa: in Congo, Cameroon, Zambia, Senegal, and Angola; in the Americas: Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Brazil, Mexico and the United States; and in Europe: Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1909 as the Garford Motor Truck Company, Superior is best known for constructing bodies for professional cars (hearses) and school buses. Following major downturns in both segments in the late 1970s, Superior was liquidated by its parent company in 1980. From 1925 to 1980, the company was based in Lima, Ohio. \n\nAfter its 1980 closure, the Superior name would live on through several other companies. The manufacturing of school buses would play a part of the formation of Mid Bus (acquired by Collins Industries in 2008) and the professional car operations would remain in Lima as part of Accubuilt.\n\nIn 1909, the Garford Motor Truck Company was established in Elyria, Ohio, a small town 30 miles outside Cleveland. \n\nBy June 1912, the company was awarded a lucrative contract with the United States Post Office. The first order called for 11 trucks, the following for 20 trucks, for a total of 31 trucks. \"This is very significant of the practical efficiency of this most advanced commercial car.\" The post office had experimented for two years \"with practically every truck made.\" They tried not only all the leading American trucks, but the foreign trucks, as well. The test resulted in the Garford being awarded first honors. The Garford proved to be the most practical truck under all conditions.\n\nIn 1925, Garford Motor Truck changed its name to the Superior Body Company and moved its operations to Lima, Ohio, where it occupied a new plant housing a large manufacturing facility and administrative offices. The company diversified, introducing a line of hearse and ambulance bodies (known as professional cars) and becoming a major producer of school bus bodies for the U.S. and Canada, as well as export markets. \n\nFor its professional-car platforms, Superior signed an agreement with Studebaker, thus gaining instant access to some 3000 dealers and Studebaker's chassis engineering. The company had continuing success for several years, and on the strength of this arrangement, rose to a prominent position in the professional-car business. By 1930, Superior and Studebaker had the only complete line of professional cars in the North American market. \n\nIn 1938, having achieved success and having established a dealer network of its own, Superior left the partnership with Studebaker and began building bodies on General Motors platforms.\n\nIn 1940 the company changed its name again, to Superior Coach Company. School bus bodies were built primarily on Chevrolet/GMC, Dodge, Ford, and International Harvester truck chassis. In 1951 the Lima facility was expanded and a new facility in Kosciusko, Mississippi was opened.\n\nIn 1969 Superior was acquired by the Sheller-Globe Corporation, an industrial conglomerate and auto parts maker based in Toledo, Ohio. \n\nThe 1977 model year saw a major downsizing in the Cadillac automobile chassis used for the professional car business. In addition to being smaller, Cadillac's commercial chassis was significantly more expensive. Superior and other ambulance and funeral car manufacturers had to design new bodies and retool their factories, resulting in much higher consumer costs. The ambulance sector switched to larger van-based vehicles or and truck chassis. 1977 also brought new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for school buses built after 1 April, which increased both costs and engineering challenges. At the same time, a downturn in North American school bus purchase volumes began as the children of the Baby Boom generation completed their elementary and secondary educations. \n\nBy 1980, Superior was one of the six major school bus body manufacturing companies in the United States, competing with Blue Bird, Carpenter, Thomas, Ward Body Company|Ward, and Wayne, as well as Gillig and Crown whose buses were primarily sold on the West Coast. Bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity; in 1979, Ward declared bankruptcy, reorganizing as AmTran the following year, which later became IC Bus. \n\nFaced with these challenges, school bus industry overcapacity, the loss of ambulance business in the professional car sector, and decreased sales of funeral coaches due to higher production and sales costs, Sheller-Globe liquidated its Superior Coach-related investments in late 1980, and portions of its assets were sold.\n\nAfter Sheller-Globe announced the closure of its Lima bus and professional car manufacturing operations in 1980, several small businesses purchased portions of the assets, and carried on successfully with several product lines.\n\nAlthough large school bus manufacturing was discontinued with the 1980 model year, Mid Bus—a new small business based in Lima organized by three former employees—resumed production of the smallest Superior school buses, beginning with a workforce of seven people. The business grew successfully, and after a move to a much larger facility at Bluffton, Ohio, it was acquired by Collins Industries in 1998.\n\nIn 1981 Superior's hearse business was sold to Tom Earnhart. Later that year, it was merged with the largest competitor, the S&S Coach Company. This formed a new company, S&S/Superior of Ohio, to oversee the further development of the two businesses. Manufacturing operations were consolidated at Superior's plant in Lima, which had been expanded 30 years earlier.\n\nAs of 2007, S&S/Superior now operates as a division of Accubuilt, using the Superior Coach trade name for its line of funeral cars and specialty vehicles. Accubuilt's flagship facility was also the exclusive production plant for the W.P. Chrysler Executive Series 300, a longer-wheelbase version of the Chrysler 300. In late 2017 Accubuilt was purchased by Sean Myers, owner of Armbruster Stageway, and was once again named S&S/Superior Coach Company. \n\nAccubuilt's Limousine Division also operates a facility in Springfield, Missouri, that manufactures limousines with wheelbase extensions up to .\n\n\n\n\nThe partner only lasted for one year.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1988, nearly a decade after Sheller-Globe exited the school bus manufacturing business, a Superior bus was involved in a disastrous crash. The bus had been built only 9 days before the more stringent 1977 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards would have required better collision protection of the fuel tank, a wider central aisle for better access to the emergency door, and other safety improvements. Although no legal determination of product liability was ever made, Sheller-Globe and Ford Motor Company each contributed substantially to the settlement funds for those injured and the families of those who were killed. As of 2010, the Carrollton bus disaster remained one of the two worst bus accidents in U.S. history.\n\nThe accident and the legal battle afterward were recounted in a 1994 book by James S. Kuen. \"Reckless Disregard: Corporate Greed, Government Indifference, and the Kentucky School Bus Crash\" was published by Simon & Schuster of New York City. ()\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1903946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903946", "title": "Konstantin Paustovsky", "text": "Konstantin Paustovsky\n\nKonstantin Georgiyevich Paustovsky (; – July 14, 1968) was a Russian Soviet writer nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature in 1965.\n\nKonstantin Paustovsky was born in Moscow. His father, descendant of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, was a railroad statistician, and was “an incurable romantic and Protestant”. His mother came from the family of a Polish intellectual. \n\nKonstantin grew up in Ukraine, partly in the countryside and partly in Kiev. He studied in “the First Imperial” classical Gymnasium of Kiev, where he was the classmate of Mikhail Bulgakov. When he was in the 6th grade his father left the family and he was forced to give private lessons in order to earn a living. In 1912 he entered the faculty of Natural History in University of Kiev. In 1914 he transferred to the Law faculty of the University of Moscow, but World War I interrupted his education. \n\nAt first he worked as a trolley-man in Moscow, then as a paramedic in a hospital train. During 1915, his medical unit retreated all the way through Poland and Belarus. After two of his brothers died on the front line, he returned to his mother in Moscow but later left and wandered around, trying his hands at many jobs, initially working in the metallurgical factories in Yekaterinoslav (now: Dnipro, Ukraine) and Yuzovka (now: Donetsk, Ukraine). In 1916 he lived in Taganrog, where he worked at the Taganrog Boiler Factory (now: Krasny Kotelschchik). \n\nLater he joined a cooperative association of fishermen (artel) in Taganrog, where he started his first novel Романтики (\"Romantiki\", Romantics) which was published in 1935. The novel, whose content and feelings are reflected in its title, described what he had seen and felt in his youth. One of the heroes, the old Oscar, was an artist who resisted all of his life being forced to become a moneymaker. He returned to the main theme of Romantics, the destiny of an artist who strives to overcome his loneliness, and his experiences in Taranrog in later works, including Разговор о рыбе (“Razgovor o ribe”, Conversation about the Fish), Азовское подполье (“Azovskoe podpolie”, Azov Underground) and Порт в траве (“Port v trave”, Seaport in The Grass).\n\nPaustovsky began writing while still in Gymnasium. His first works were imitative poetry but he restricted his writing to prose after Ivan Bunin wrote in a letter to him: \"I think that your sphere, your real poetry, is prose. It is here, if you are determined enough, that I am sure you can achieve something significant.\" His first stories to be published were “Na vode” (“On The Water”) and “Chetvero” (“The Four”) in 1911 and 1912. During World War I, he wrote sketches of life at the front, one of which was published. His first book, \"Morskiye Nabroski\" (“Sea Sketches”), was published in 1925, but received little attention. This was followed by \"Minetoza\" in 1927, and the romantic novel \"Blistaiushie Oblaka\" (“Shining Clouds”) in 1929. His work of this period was influenced by Alexander Grin as well as the writers of the \"Odessa school\", (Isaac Babel, Valentin Kataev, and Yuri Olesha). In the 1930s, Paustovsky visited various constructions sites and wrote in praise of the industrial transformation of the country. To that period belong the novels \"Kara-Bugaz\" (1932) and \"Kolkhida\" (1934). \"Kara-Bugaz\" won particular praise. It is essentially a tale of adventure and exploration in the region around Kara-Bugaz Bay, where the air is mysteriously heavy. It begins in 1847 and moves to the Russian Civil War period when a group of Red Guards is abandoned to near-certain death on a desolate island. Some of them, though do survive and are rescued by an explorer and stay on to help in the exploration, development and study of the natural wealth of the region.\n\nPaustovsky continued to explore historical themes in \"Severnaya Povest\" (\"Tale of the North\", 1938). In this tale, after the anti-Tsarist Decembrist uprising in Saint Petersburg, a wounded officer who had taken part in the uprising and a sailor try to make it by foot across the ice to Sweden but are captured in a sequence of dramatic events. Years later, in Leningrad in the 1930s, the great-grandsons of the participants unexpectedly meet. In the late 1930s, Russian nature emerged as a central theme for Paustovsky, for example, in \"Letniye Dni\" (\"Summer Days\", 1937) and \"Meshcherskaya Storona\" (1939) in which he treats nature was a many-faceted splendor in which man can free himself from daily cares and regain his spiritual equilibrium. This focus on nature drew comparisons with Mikhail Prishvin. Prishvin himself wrote in his diary, \"If I were not Prishvin, I would like to write like Paustovsky.\"\n\nDuring World War II Paustovsky served as a war correspondent on the southern front. In 1943 he produced a screenplay for the Gorky Film Studio production of \"Lermontov\", directed by Albert Gendelshtein. Another work of note is \"Tale of the Woods\" (1948). This story opens in a remote forest in the 1890s, where Tchaikovsky is composing a symphony. The young daughter of a local forester often brings Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky berries. Half a century later, the daughter of this girl is a laboratory technician working in the local forest station.\n\nFrom 1948 until 1955, Paustovsky taught at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. He also edited literary collections including Literary Moscow (1956) and \"Pages from Tarusa\", in which he sought to bring new writers to the public's attention and to publish writers suppressed during the Joseph Stalin years.\n\nOther major works include \"Snow\", \"Crossing Ships\" (1928); \"The Black Sea\" (1936); and \"The Rainy Dawn\" (1946). Paustovsky was also the author of several plays and fairy tales, including \"Steel Ring\" and of Zolotaya Rosa \"The Golden Rose\" (1955), in which he discusses the process of literary creation.\n\nPerhaps Paustovsky's most famous work is his autobiography “Povest o Zhizni” (“Story of a Life”). It is not a strictly historical document but rather a long, lyrical tale focusing on the internal perceptions and poetic development of the writer. It has been called a \"biography of the soul\" rather than a biography of events. Nonetheless, it does provide a unique view of life in Russia during the turbulent years of World War I, the Russian Civil War and rise of the Soviets, all of which Paustovsky participated in.\n\nIn 1965, Paustovsky was nominated for a Nobel Prize for literature, the prize was awarded instead to Mikhail Sholokhov.\n\nIn February 1966 he was one of the 25 prominent figures from science and the arts who signed a letter to the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, appealing against re-Stalinization in the wake of the Sinyavsky-Daniel trial.\n\nHe died in Moscow on July 14, 1968.\n\n\n2.

{"id": "1903957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903957", "title": "Katamon", "text": "Katamon\n\nKatamon or Qatamon ( \"Katamun\", , \"Katamónas\") is a Jewish neighbourhood in south-central Jerusalem. The official Hebrew name, Gonen (), is only used in municipal publications. Katamon is derived from the Greek κατὰ τῷ μοναστηρίῳ (\"by the monastery\").\n\nThe neighborhood is built next to an old Greek Orthodox monastery, believed to be built on the home and the tomb of Simeon from the Gospel of Luke. The neighborhood was established in the early 1900s, shortly before World War I as a wealthy, predominantly Christian neighborhood. During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine the local population fled the neighborhood and it was soon repopulated by Jewish refugees.\n\nKatamon is bounded by the neighborhoods of Talbiya in the northeast, and the German Colony and Greek Colony to the southeast. The neighbourhood is bounded on its south side by Rachel Imenu street and Hizkiyahu Ha'Melech street (separating it from the Greek Colony), and on its east side by Kovshey Katamon street (separating it from Talbiya). These streets connect to Emek Refaim and Rehov ha-Palmach, respectively. During the British Mandate era, the neighborhood was divided into Upper Katamon and Lower Katamon.\n\nDuring the British Mandate era the streets of Katamon had no names, with the exception of two: \"Katamon\" street (today known as \"Rachel Imenu\" and \"Hizkiyahu HaMelech\") and \"Jorden\" street (today known as \"Tel Hai\" street) which was nicknamed \"Michael Sansour\" street, who was a wealthy contractor whose house was in the street. The buildings were not numbered and were named after the families who built them. After Israel's independence names were given to the roads based on subjects such as the 1948 war, biblical characters and Zionist figures.\n\nFrom the late 14th century, the location of Katamon seem to have been identified with the home of Simeon from the Gospel of Luke, the Jerusalemite who first recognised the infant Jesus as \"the Lord's Christ\", i.e. the promised Messiah ().\n\nIn 1524, after the Ottoman Turks conquered the region from the Mamluks, it was reported that a church of St Simeon, previously held by the Georgians, was now empty in the wake of Muslim attacks. In 1681 Cornelis de Bruijn made an engraving of Jerusalem, which suggested that there was an L-shaped, four-story-high tower in Katamon, confirming an early 17th-century source which mentioned a \"house and tower\" of \"Simeon the prophet\". The Greek Orthodox acquired the site in 1859 and in 1881 they built there a new church and residence for their Patriarch, incorporating the older ruins. The Greek Orthodox call it \"St. Symeon of Katamonas\" and believe that it is built over the tomb of Simeon, with an inscription in a cave on the grounds interpreted to indicate that it was the tomb of Simeon's priestly forefathers. In 1890 the Greek–Orthodox patriarch Nicodemus I of Jerusalem built his summer house near the monastery (since the 1960s the building serves as a disabled care center).\n\nThe neighborhood began to develop in the late Ottoman Era, in the early 1900s. According to Israeli geographer Gideon Biger, Katamon was probably planned before World War I. The lands in Katamon, like in Talbiya and Baka, were owned by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. In the late 19th century the church had a financial crisis which worsened during World War I. The Church sold, shortly before the war, some of its estate outside of the Old City, which were deemed as \"less holy\" including Katamon, which was split into plots for housing in a rural area.\n\nGerman aerial photographs taken during the war show building lots demarcated by stones at Katamon in a grid plan way, and a system of dirt roads. Despite the low prices, the neighborhood did not attract Jewish buyers because the area was completely Christian, next to the Greek Colony, German Colony and Baka. Until the war five houses were built in Katamon.\n\nDuring the 1920s, some 90 new residential plots were planned in Katamon and their construction began shortly after the war, especially after 1924. In a short time, some 40 luxurious buildings were built in the neighborhood, by Christian–Arab families. The buildings were built in plan for different blocs and not for the entire neighborhood. About half of Katamon's buildings were built between 1927 and 1937, and the rest were built until 1948. Most of Katamon's residents were mostly educators, teachers, businessmen, contractors, traders and other professionals from the upper and middle class. Along with private houses, apartment buildings were built for the purpose of rent.\n\nThe neighborhood developed into a prosperous, bourgeois neighborhood with a European–Cosmopolitan character whilst retaining the local, oriental culture. Most of the builders were Arab–Christians from the Greek–Orthodox community, headed by Issa Michael al-Toubbeh, but among them were some Latin rite Catholics (some from an Italian origin) and Armenian Protestants. A phenomenon which contributed to the neighborhood's cosmopolitan character was intermarriage between different Christian communities. The apartments were rented to Arab people and British officials, army officers and their families, who preferred to live in a Christian neighborhood.\n\nMost of the children were sent to high quality and expensive schools, usually private ones. The schools teaching languages were usually English, Italian, German or French.\n\nThe members of the Greek–Orthodox community lived a secular lifestyle, visiting churches only on holidays and family events. They used to pray in the church of the San Simon Monastery, the church of the Monastery of the Cross or in churches in the Christian Quarter of the Old City. The Latin rite Catholic community made their prayer at the Chapel of St. Theresa in Katamon or in churches located in the Old City. Protestant families conducted their prayer at the St. George's Cathedral or in the Old City.\n\nMany of the residents worked in British public services and many were members of YMCA. Many consulates were established in the neighborhood including the consulates of Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Italy (which remains the consulates of Italy in Israel today), Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Three small hotels and a pension existed in the neighborhood before 1948 and there was a British sports club in the neighborhood, which was later used by Hapoel Jerusalem football club for a few years.\n\nDuring the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine Katamon was largely abandoned by its residents. The evacuation of Arabs was reported already on 10 December, and British assistance to the evacuation was reported on the beginning of January. The neighbourhood's handful of Jewish inhabitants left during the war's first weeks. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, they left either out of fear or under Arab intimidation.\n\nThe neighborhood was an Arab neighborhood between two Jewish neighborhoods and the only one in a line of Jewish neighborhoods. On the night of 5–6 January 1948, the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel in Katamon, killing 24 or 26 people. According to Benny Morris The Haganah believed that several irregulars' commanders lived there and, possibly mistakenly, that the hotel served as the neighbourhood militia headquarters. After the attack many Arab residents of the neighborhood began fleeing, most of them were women, children and elders. Most fled to the Old City and some fled to the southern part of Qatamon which was around the Iraqi consulate defended by the Jordanian Arab Legion. Some of the middle-class residents found refuge in Bethlehem. The Arab authorities tried to stem the flight and many young men who fled to the Old City returned to Qatamon. Hala al-Sakakini, the daughter of Palestinian scholar and poet Khalil al-Sakakini and a resident of Katamon, described in her diary how frightened residents fled their homes and did not respond to the orders to remain. By March only a few families remained in the neighborhood, guarded by irregular forces based on San Simon Monastery.\n\nDuring the war, attacks by the Arabic side originated from the Greek Orthodox Saint Simeon Monastery in Katamon that was located in a strategic point overlooking the Jewish neighborhoods. On mid April the Jewish leadership halted Operation Harel near Jerusalem and ordered the Harel Brigade to deploy in the city and conduct Operation Yevusi. The reason behind the order was false reports of a fast British evacuation from the city and that the Arabs are deploying large forces in the city in order to fill the vacuum. In the battle over Katamon, which was centered around the St. Simeon monastery, most of the Arab fighters in the city participated, after they were called upon by the local militia. Fighters from the nearby Arab villages refused to send support, claiming they need to defend themselves. The commander of the Arab forces, Ibrahim Abu-Dayyeh, was one of the prominent Arab commanders and earned respect due to his involvement during the battle over the Nabi Daniel Convoy and the battle over Sheikh Jarrah. His men were equipped with light weapons and homemade armoured vehicles as well as ones looted from the battle of Nabi Daniel. Against them were the Jewish fighters of the fourth battalion of the Harel Brigade, who were exhausted from the constant fighting in earlier battles. During the fights both sides suffered from total exhaustion. The Arabs called on the Jordanian Arab Legion to intervene but they refused. When the Arabs saw no reinforcement will arrive they decided to halt their attack and withdrew, letting to Jews take the neighborhood. During the battles, Rafael Eitan, then a platoon commander, was shot in the head. \n\nOn September 17, 1948, UN Mediator Folke Bernadotte and UN Observer André Serot, were assassinated by members of the Jewish Lehi organisation while driving on Palmach Street in Katamon.\n\nDuring May–June, some 1,400 Jews, consisting of women, children, elders and wounded were expelled from the Jewish Quarter of the Old City by the Jordanian Arab Legion after it fell on 28 May. Some were settled in houses in Katamon, abandoned by its Arab owners. The neighborhood was also temporarily settled with Jewish women and children from front-line kibbutzim in the Jerusalem corridor. The abandoned neighborhood, as well as other evacuated Arab neighborhoods were looted by the displaced Jews and Israeli soldiers who entered empty Arab houses, a phenomenon that the Jewish authorities failed to halt, usually turning a blind eye to it. This phenomenon was condemned by Israeli politician Dov Yosef, for ethical and moral reason, as well as practical reasons. The looters also took door and window frames, and taps, which made the relocation of refugees more difficult.\n\nJewish immigrants and government officials joined the Old City's refugees and settled in Katamon after the war. In order to allow as many people to live in the neighborhood, the apartments were divided into smaller units. In buildings which housed one family, three or four new families were settled. Because of the difficulties, unauthorized renovations and improvised extensions made by the residents.\n\nSome of Katamon's buildings were designated for public needs, such as synagogues, schools, kindergartens and places for elders. One of the apartment buildings was used as a new location to the Misgav Ladach hospital, originally from the Old City.\n\nIn the early 1970s, a process of gentrification began in Katamon when people of the middle class bought the apartments where low class residents lived and started renovating them, reuniting the apartments that were split after 1948 and overall raising the standards of the houses. Katamon attracted many people because of the character of its small \"Arab styled\" houses, with yards, stone walls and gates, porches, tiled roofs and stylized floors, located close to the city's center. The neighborhood had a slow process of population change and social and physical renewal. The conservative and semi-rural character attracted, mainly after the 1980s, families of Jewish immigrants, mostly wealthy religious ones from western countries, who were able to purchase and renovate the houses.\n\nSince the 1970s, the neighborhood, which was populated mostly by secular and \"masorti\" Jews, has been having a process of Haredization, including the construction of apartment blocks for Haredi Jews.\n\nA major landmark in Katamon is the Saint Simeon monastery, known to Jerusalemites as San Simon, on a hilltop to the north. The monastery is now surrounded by a large park in the neighborhood known as Givat Oranim.\n\nIn the center of the neighborhood lies the Recha Freier square. Around the square are five historical buildings that were used for the embasse\nies and foreign consulates of Lebanon (during the British era only), Poland, Venezuela, El Salvador,Belgium and Greece. The Greek consulate remains there since the 1950s as the Greek consulate in Jerusalem.\n\nKatamon is also home to the Israel Goldstein Youth Village, which has a number of school programs (boarding and day schools), especially for Russian and French Olim. Also in the Youth Village is Ramah Israel, which hosts teens from North America through the Ramah Seminar program for 6 weeks in the summer and Tichon Ramah Yerushalayim (Ramah Jerusalem High School) for 4.5 months in the Spring.\n\nThe neighbourhood was home to the Hapoel Jerusalem football club from the 1930s until it moved back to the YMCA Stadium in the 1980s. In 2007, several dissatisfied Hapoel Jerusalem fans formed a new club, naming it Hapoel Katamon Jerusalem after the club's former home, although the new club does not play in the neighborhood.\n\nKatamon was the home of several foreign consulates, among them the Greek consulate, the Italian consulate, and the Costa-Rican consulate. The old Hapoel stadium was purchased by developers and is now the site of the upscale Ganei Katamon neighborhood, ringing Ofira Navon park.\n\nThe Misgav Ladach hospital on the southern edge of the neighbourhood specialized in maternity care, but is now a Kupat Holim Meuhedet diagnostic center. The Museum for Islamic Art is located on Palmach Street in Katamon. Katamon also houses the core community of Erlau Hassidism, as well its yeshiva, Ohel Shimon. The International Christian Embassy Jerusalem has been based in Katamon since 1997.\n\nTo the west, Old Katamon branches out into several neighbourhoods collectively called the \"Katamonim\" (plural of \"Katamon\"; officially \"Gonenim\", lit. \"Defenders\"), built in the early years of the state to accommodate the large wave of new immigrants, previously living in tent camps. These neighborhoods were assigned Hebrew numerals : Katamon Khet (\"Katamon 8\"), Katamon Tet (\"Katamon 9), etc. Some of those neighborhoods have a second name. Katamon Hei (5) is also called San Simon Neighborhood, a part of Katamon Het (8) and Katamon tet (9) is sometimes called San Martin Neighborhood, and Katamon zayn (7) is Pat neighborhood.\n\nKatamon Khet was built at the end of the 1950s, and Katamon Tet in the mid-1960s. The Katamonim are characterized by long apartment blocks on pillars, providing low-cost housing. Some of the buildings are still government-owned, although the Amidar housing company sold many of the apartments to the residents in the 1970s. The neighborhood hosts a well-known WIZO community center called after Helena Kagan.\n\nPrior to the Six-Day War in June 1967, the Katamonim were on the Jordanian-Israeli armistice line. Massive infrastructure improvement was financed by an urban renewal project known as \"Project Renewal\" over a period of two decades. Many small apartments were combined into larger ones and the outward appearance of the apartment blocks was improved. Since the 1990s, many Russian and Ethiopian immigrants have been given housing there.\n\nThe Jerusalem Tennis Center, founded in 1981 and dedicated in 1982 by the Jewish community of South Africa in memory of Yossi Zeituni, a tennis coach who fell in the Lebanon War, is located in the Katamonim. The center has 19 courts and a stadium with seating for 2,000 spectators.\n\nThere are a number of schools located in Katamon of various types, including separate religious schools, pluralistic schools and both elementary and high schools. These include Chorev (a religious elementary school), Hartman (a religious high school with separate sites for boys and girls) and Henrietta Szold (a pluralistic elementary school).\n\nThe 2008–2012 Israeli television drama \"Srugim\" takes place in Katamon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1903960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903960", "title": "Crown Coach Corporation", "text": "Crown Coach Corporation\n\nThe Crown Coach Corporation (founded as the Crown Carriage Company) is a defunct American bus manufacturer. Established in 1904, Crown was headquartered in Los Angeles, California until the mid-1980s, moving to Chino, California until its closure. Best known for its Supercoach range of yellow school buses and motorcoaches, Crown also was the manufacturer of custom-built vehicles derived from its buses, including the Firecoach line of fire apparatus. \n\nCrown Coach closed in March 1991 due to declining demand for school buses at the time. At the time of its closure, Crown Coach was a subsidiary of GE Railcar.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Don M. Brockway found himself working at the first hardware store in Los Angeles, California. To supplement its income, the hardware store sold parts for wagons and carriages. In 1904, Brockway founded his own company, as Crown Carriage Company began life producing horse-drawn carriages. While the first vehicles were built in a wooden shed, the company moved to a brick factory in 1910.\n\nAfter 1910, as carriages gradually became \"horseless\", Crown experimented with building truck bodies. In 1916, the company built its first bus body for transit use; it was an open-air design heavily influenced by wagon design. After World War I, Crown built its first body for school bus use.\n\nIn 1921, a major shift in company production occurred as Murillo M. (\"Brock\") Brockway, the son of the company founder, was put in charge of school bus production. Viewing school buses as a growth market in the suburbs of southern California, Brockway discontinued all wagon production in favor of bus and truck body production. To expand production and improve shipping of its vehicles, a much larger factory in Los Angeles was opened in 1923.\n\nIn pursuit of developing heavier-duty and higher-capacity school buses, Crown introduced the first school bus with dual rear wheels in 1927 (on a Reo chassis). In 1930, it produced its first all-metal school bus body (on a Mack chassis), with a 43-passenger capacity.\n\n1932 would mark several major changes for the company. As part of his taking over day-to-day operations of Crown from his father, MM Brockway introduced a ground-breaking school bus body; elements of its design would change school bus design forever. To improve forward visibility, the new bus was a cab-forward design, with the driver sitting next to the engine and radiator. To improve safety, the bus was designed with an integral chassis; the windows were mesh-reinforced safety glass. Alongside the standard braking system, the bus also was equipped with two backup braking systems.\n\nIn 1935, the cab-forward school bus was updated and dubbed the \"Crown Supercoach\".\n\nFor 1937, to increase seating capacity to 79 passengers, Crown produced its first mid-engine Supercoach; the bus came with a Hall-Scott gasoline engine. In 1939, Crown acquired Moreland Motor Truck Company; as part of the acquisition, Crown moved to a larger factory in Los Angeles. Additionally, the Supercoach was changed from a mid-engine to a rear-engine configuration for 1940.\n\nDuring World War II, the production of Crown Coach was diverted towards military use; most bodies produced by the company were fire engine bodies for four-wheel drive truck chassis. Following the war, the company returned to bus production, beginning design work on the 1948 Supercoach. As a side project, engineers at the company designed an all-new cabover fire engine, using the mid-engine chassis of the Supercoach bus. The first Crown Firecoach prototype was completed in 1951, after two years of design work. Alongside the initial pumper design, Crown developed several configurations of the Firecoach, including water tenders, tiller and ladder trucks, and quints (TeleSquirts).\n\nIn the United States during the years immediately following World War II, population growth of suburbs expanded, fueled by the post-war baby boom. As that segment of the population entered school, demand for new schools (and school buses to transport their students) rapidly rose. In 1946, Crown began development on a new mid-engine Supercoach. Heavily influenced by motorcoach design, Crown intended it primarily for school bus use. Introduced in 1949, the all-new Supercoach used unit-body construction with high-strength steel in place of a separate chassis; to combat corrosion, all body panels were aluminum.\n\nTo prove the durability of the Supercoach to potential customers, Crown offered the Supercoach with a 20-year/100,000 mile warranty for the body.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s, Crown made several changes to the Supercoach. In 1954, the company made the Cummins NHH available as an option, producing the first diesel-engined school bus. In 1955, Crown developed the largest school bus in the United States. In expanding the bodyshell to 40 feet (then the maximum for both school buses and motorcoaches) and adding a second rear axle, Crown raised the seating capacity from 79 to 91 passengers. As a later option, some school districts ordered the Supercoach with a 16th row of seats, further expanding seating to 97 passengers; as with its Gillig counterpart, the 97-passenger Supercoach is the highest-capacity school bus ever sold in the United States. \n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, school bus production on the West Coast evolved separately from the rest of the United States, with the Crown Supercoach and the similar Gillig Transit Coach having a near-monopoly of the school bus segment in California and a large share of the rest of the West Coast. Outside of the region, many operators continued use of lower-capacity conventional-type buses based upon truck chassis. For users seeking lower-capacity buses on the West Coast, in place of developing an all-new model line from the ground up, both Crown and Gillig chose to serve as the West Coast distributor for other manufacturers. At various times, Crown would market Wayne, Blue Bird, and Thomas Built Buses in California. \n\nSharing much of its underlying structure with the Crown school bus, the intercity Crown Supercoach was marketed with several configurations. Along with an underfloor configuration, Crown also produced a rear-engine version, as well as a raised-floor configuration (along with a version similar to the Scenicruiser); the latter two provided for increased luggage space. To supplement its motorcoach offerings, in 1969, Crown became one of the first distributors of Quebec-built Prevost motorcoaches in the United States. \n\nThe Firecoach was produced through the 1960s and 1970s with relatively few changes. While sold primarily across the West Coast, examples of the Crown Firecoach were purchased by fire departments across the United States. In 1965, a roof was made standard for all Firecoaches, in the interest of firefighter safety.\n\nIn 1979, the Brockway family sold Crown Coach Corporation to a local truck distributor; this began a sequence of ownership changes. Due to slow sales, Crown ended production of the motorcoach version of the Supercoach in 1980, focusing entirely on school buses. By 1982, sales of the aging Firecoach had largely collapsed, leading to a temporary hiatus of its production. After 34 years of production and slightly over 1800 examples produced, the final Firecoach was produced in 1985.\n\nDuring 1984, Crown moved its headquarters and production from Los Angeles to Chino, California in San Bernardino County. To diversify beyond the Supercoach-based product line, Crown entered into a joint venture with the Hungarian firm Ikarus to produce articulated mass-transit buses. At 102 inches wide and 60 feet long, the Crown-Ikarus 286 was the longest and widest bus ever produced by Crown Coach. Bodied by Ikarus in Hungary, the transit bus was imported to Crown in California for final assembly, including its interior and American-sourced powertrain (shared with the Supercoach). In 1986, the partnership ended, with 243 examples produced.\n\nAt the end of 1986, Crown Coach entered into receivership; in addition to the closure of production, the Los Angeles factory (owned since 1939) was sold. In April 1987, the company was purchased at auction by GE Railcar. After a reorganization as Crown Coach, Incorporated, production in Chino restarted in July 1987. \n\nAs the 1980s ended, the Crown Supercoach had reached over 40 years of production with only minor evolutionary changes made through its production. In 1989, the California Energy Commission began a study to test low-emission school buses, using methanol-fueled vehicles as part of the test; Crown Coach was a manufacturer selected to take part of the study, using a methanol-fuel Detroit Diesel 6V92 engine. The fitment of the engine required an extensive update of the rear bodywork of the Supercoach, leading to a matching update of the front bodywork. Although not a completely new design, the Series II, as it was named, was the first major update to the Supercoach since 1948. \n\nAfter its acquisition by GE Railcar, assembly operation ceased on March 31, 1991. Crown's difficulty in competing with manufacturers of smaller, less durable but cheaper school buses was cited by company president Bruce Freeman in October 1990 as a primary factor in GE's decision to leave the school bus market.\n\n"}
{"id": "1903966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903966", "title": "Management of hair loss", "text": "Management of hair loss\n\nThe management of hair loss, also known as alopecia or baldness, may include medications and surgery.\n\nTreatments for the various forms of hair loss have only moderate success. Three medications have evidence to support their use in male pattern hair loss: finasteride, dutasteride and minoxidil. They typically work better to prevent further hair loss than to regrow lost hair.\n\nThey may be used together when hair loss is progressive or further regrowth is desired after 12 months. Other medications include ketoconazole, and in female androgenic alopecia spironolactone and flutamide. Combinations of finasteride, minoxidil and ketoconazole are more effective than individual use.\n\nMinoxidil, applied topically, is widely used for the treatment of hair loss. It may be effective in helping promote hair growth in both men and women with androgenic alopecia. About 40% of men experience hair regrowth after 3–6 months. It is the only topical product that is FDA approved in America for androgenic hair loss. However, increased hair loss has been reported.\n\nFinasteride is used to treat male pattern hair loss. Treatment provides about 30% improvement in hair loss after six months of treatment, and effectiveness only persists as long as the drug is taken. There is no good evidence for its use in women. It may cause gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction and depression.\nDutasteride is used off label for male pattern hair loss.\nThere is tentative support for spironolactone in women. Due to its feminising side effects and risk of infertility it is not often used by men. It can also cause low blood pressure, high blood potassium, and abnormal heart rhythms. Also, women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant generally cannot use the medication as it is a teratogen, and can cause ambiguous genitalia in newborn children.\nThere is tentative evidence for flutamide in women; however, it is associated with relatively high rates of liver problems. Like spironolactone, it is typically only used by women.\n\nKetoconazole may help in women.\n\nHair transplantation is a surgical technique that moves individual hair follicles from a part of the body called the donor site to bald or balding part of the body known as the recipient site. It is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this condition, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding are transplanted to bald scalp. It is also used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, and pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from skin grafting in that grafts contain almost all of the epidermis and dermis surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.\n\nSince hair naturally grows in follicles in groups of 1 to 4 hairs, transplantation takes advantage of these naturally occurring follicular units. This achieves a more natural appearance by matching hair for hair through Follicular unit transplantation (FUT).\n\nDonor hair can be harvested in two different ways. Small grafts of naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, can be moved to balding areas of the hair restoration. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in very close proximity to one another and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained in one or both of the two primary methods of surgical extraction, follicular unit transplantation, colloquially referred to as \"strip harvesting\", or Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), in which follicles are transplanted individually.\n\nIn FUT, a strip of skin containing many follicular units is extracted from the patient and dissected under a stereoscopic microscope. The site of the strip removal is stitched closed. Once divided into follicular unit grafts, each unit is individually inserted into small recipient sites made by an incision in the bald scalp. In the newer technique, roots are extracted from the donor area and divided into strips for transplantation. The strip, two to three millimeters thick, is isolated and transplanted to the bald scalp. After surgery, a bandage is worn for two days to protect the stitched strip during healing. A small strip scar remains after healing, which can be covered by scalp hair growing over the scar.\n\nScalp reduction is a surgical procedure in which the hairless region of the scalp of a bald man is reduced. This procedure can reduce the area of the scalp without hair.\n\nRadiation induces hair loss through damage to hair follicle stem cell progenitors and alteration of keratin expression. Radiation therapy has been associated with increased mucin production in hair follicles.\n\nStudies have suggested electromagnetic radiation as a therapeutic growth stimulant in alopecia.\n\n Certain hair shampoos and ointments visually thicken existing hair, without affecting the growth cycle. There have also been developments in the fashion industry with wig design. The fashion accessory has also been shown to be a source of psychological support for women undergoing chemotherapy, with cancer survivors in one study describing their wig as a \"constant companion\". Other studies in women have demonstrated a more mixed psychosocial impact of hairpiece use.\n\nSpecialized tattoos, commonly known as scalp micropigmentation, can mimic the appearance of a short buzzed haircut.\n\nMany people use unproven treatments, but there is little evidence of the effectiveness of vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements regrowing hair or retaining hair.\n\n2008 and 2012 reviews found little evidence to support the use of special lights or lasers to treat hair loss. Both laser and lights appear to be safe.\n\nA 2014 and 2016 review found tentative evidence of benefit for lasers. While another 2014 review concluded that the results are mixed, have a high risk of bias, and that its effectiveness is unclear.\n\nDietary supplements are not typically recommended. There is only one small trial of saw palmetto which shows tentative benefit in those with mild to moderate androgenetic alopecia. There is no evidence for biotin. Evidence for most other products is also insufficient. There was no good evidence for gingko, aloe vera, ginseng, bergamot, or hibiscus as of 2011. While lacking both evidence and expert recommendation, there is a large market for hair growth supplements, especially for products that contain biotin.\n\nType 1 and 2 5α reductase enzymes are present at pilosebaceous units in papillae of individual hair follicles. They catalyse formation of the androgens testosterone and DHT, which in turn regulate hair growth. Androgens have different effects at different follicles: they stimulate IGF-1 at facial hair, causing hair regrowth, but stimulate TGF β1, TGF β2, dickkopf1 and IL-6 at the scalp, causing hair follicle miniaturisation.\n\nFemale androgenic alopecia is characterized by diffuse crown thinning without hairline recession, and like its male counterpart rarely leads to total hair loss. Finasteride and minoxidil are usually first line therapy for its treatment. Other options include topical or systemic spironolactone or flutamide, although they have a high incidence of feminising side effects and are better tolerated in female androgenic hair loss.\n\nMore advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy, however, and require hair transplantation. Naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are excised and moved to areas of hair restoration. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) – colloquially referred to as \"strip harvesting\" – or Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites. Specialized scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short buzzed haircut. Androgenic alopecia also occurs in women, and more often presents as diffuse thinning without hairline recession. Like its male counterpart, the condition rarely leads to total hair loss. Treatment options are similar to those for men, although topical or systemic estrogen is used more often.\n\nLatanoprost and bimatoprost are specific PGF2a analogues applied topically, and have been found to lengthen eyelashes, darken hair pigmentation and elongate hair. Bimatoprost is available as treatment for eyelash growth. Latanoprost has shown ability to promote scalp hair density and pigmentation, and is theorized to function at the dermal papilla. A study found latanoprost ineffective on eyelashes in a patient with alopecia areata. It has also been found ineffective in treatment of eyebrow hair loss.\n\nEstrogens are indirect anti-androgens and can be used to treat androgenetic hair loss in women with oral contraceptives. Systemic estrogen increases SHBG, which binds androgens, including testosterone and DHT, in turn reducing their bioavailability. Topical formulations are available in Europe. Hair follicles have estrogen receptors and it is theorized that topical compounds act on them directly to promote hair growth and antagonize androgen action. Large clinical studies showing effectiveness are absent. Topical treatment is also usually unavailable in North America.\n\nThere is tentative evidence for cyproterone acetate in women.\n\nIn December 2012, topical application of IGF-1 in a liposomal vehicle led to thicker and more rapid hair growth in transgenic mice with androgenic alopecia. The study did not show measurable systemic levels or hematopoietic side effects, suggesting potential for use in humans. Low energy radiofrequency irradiation induces IGF-1 in cultured human dermal papilla cells. Adenosine stimulates dermal papillae in vitro to induce IGF-1, along with fibroblast growth factors FGF7, FGF-2 and VEGF. β-catenin transcription increased, which promotes dermal papillae as well. Dietary isoflavones increase IGF production in scalp dermal papillae in transgenic mice. Topical capsaicin also stimulates IGF at hair follicles via release of vanilloid receptor-1, which in turn leads to more CGRP. Ascorbic acid has led to increased IGF expression \"in vitro\".\n\nReviews in 2013 and 2017 on the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to regrow hair found insufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions.\n\nAlthough follicles were previously thought gone in areas of complete baldness, they are more likely dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cells from which the follicles arose. Research on these follicular stem cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through \"hair multiplication\" (HM), also known as \"hair cloning\".\n\nPer a May 2015 review, no successful strategy to generate human hair follicles, for hair regrowth, from adult stem cells has yet been reported. However, in April 2016, scientists from Japan published results of their work in which they created human skin from induced pluripotent stem cells; implanted into laboratory mice, the cells generated skin with hair and glands.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007 Curis and Procter & Gamble collaborated on developing a topical hedgehog agonist for hair loss; the agent did not meet safety standards, and the program was terminated. In 2008 researchers at the University of Bonn announced they have found the genetic basis of two distinct forms of inherited hair loss. They found the gene P2RY5 causes a rare, inherited form of hair loss called hypotrichosis simplex. It is the first receptor in humans known to play a role in hair growth. Researchers found that disruption of the gene SOX21 in mice caused cyclical hair loss. Research has suggested SOX21 as a master regulator of hair shaft cuticle differentiation, with its disruption causing cyclical alopecia in mice models. Deletion of SOX21 dramatically affects hair lipids.\n\n"}
{"id": "1903970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903970", "title": "Bletilla", "text": "Bletilla\n\nBletilla, common name urn orchid, is a temperate, terrestrial genus of orchids containing five currently recognized species distributed through China, Japan, Taiwan, south to Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. The name is actually a diminutive of \"Bletia\" because of the resemblance between the two genera even though Bletia is a New World genus. The genera Jimensia and Polytoma are generally included into \"Bletilla\". This genus is abbreviated Ble in trade journals.\n\nThe pseudobulbs resemble spreading corms which usually sit at ground level. Each pseudobulb generally bears several pleated leaves around 40 cm long. The racemes of flowers emerge from the center of the years new growth before it is mature, during spring and early summer. The flowers vary in color from white to purple, and all species have four pollinia.\nThe tubers resemble a horn or claw. They are grayish-white or yellowish-white in appearance, with concentric rings and brown rootlets. They have a hard texture and do not break easily.\n\n\"Bletilla\" species are generally hardy, though some need protection from severely cold frost. It is better to keep them in pots of well-drained media so that water does not sit around the roots during winter when the plants are not actively growing. They should also be watered sparingly at the start of the growing season as the new shoots emerge, as new roots often do not follow for around four weeks afterwards.\n\n\"Bletilla striata\" is the most common form found in the nursery trade and is often labeled simply as 'Hardy Orchid' or 'Chinese Ground Orchid' and is quite inexpensive. This beautiful and hardy deciduous orchid has the distinction of being one of the first orchids in cultivation in England dating from around 1794. The very flat knob-like tuberous root system is typically sympodial, expansive and each shoot is of annual duration only. On established plants, almost every new growth shoot has a flower spike before leaves fully develop. Each shoot can have up to fourteen beautiful rose-mauve flowers with a ruffled lip about 30mm diameter, scentless and looking something like a miniature Cattleya orchid flower. An established clump can have literally dozens of flower spikes flowering in the late Spring and the clumps only increase in beauty with time. They rarely exceed two feet in height.\n\nThe flowers and leaves are at the mercy of late frosts, which are to be avoided if at all possible with coverings of a sheet or newspapers. Resist the temptation to remove the mulch layer even if the new growths are raising up the mulch due to an early Spring, unless no more frosts are likely. Unlike most tropical orchids, B. striata has attractive foliage even when not flowering. The pleated, tapered foliage looks very similar to the juvenile leaves of many palm species. A well established clump of these in flower is quite beautiful and they are surprisingly hardy even into USDA Zone 5 with a heavy mulch. They easily succeed in USDA Zone 6 with only a moderate mulch of straw or leaves. These hardiness ratings only apply to plants in the ground with the idea of preventing the actual root system from being frozen. If potted, they should be placed in a frost-free location if winter temperatures go below freezing. The plant is generally considered hardy without a mulch if minimum winter temperatures do not go below 25 °F.\n\nThey have a great reputation of being the absolute easiest orchid for a beginner to grow. Unlike most tropical epiphytic orchids, this plant comes from somewhat temperate zones and grows in soil rather than on trees and require no extraordinary care to grow successfully. They prefer well drained evenly moist soils that are high in organic material and that never dry out nor remain sodden. They are sympodial growers and will form handsome clumps in only a few years. Other species and hybrids are occasionally available, the most common being \"B. striata\" var. \"alba\", a white variation of the rose-mauve \"B. striata\". \"Bletilla ochracea\", a somewhat rare species from China has unusual flowers with yellow sepals and petals with a red-marked white lip and is becoming more available to collectors. \"Bletilla\" Penway Dragon (\"formosana\" × \"szetschuaunica\") appears to be one of the exciting new hybrid grex if it becomes more available.\n\nCurrently recognized species as of May 2014:\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote plays, social criticism, and histories of the ancient Russian social order. His father Sergey Aksakov and his sister Vera Aksakova were writers, and his younger brother, Ivan Aksakov, was a journalist.\n\nKonstantin was the first to publish an analysis of Gogol's \"Dead Souls\", comparing the Russian author with Homer (1842). After Tsar Alexander II's accession to the throne, he sent him a letter advising to restore the zemsky sobor (1855). Aksakov also penned a number of articles on Slavonic linguistics.\n\nAksakov was born into a family of prominent Russian writer Sergey Timofeevich Aksakov (1791—1859) and his wife Olga Semyonovna Zaplatina (1793—1878). His paternal grandfather Timofey Stepanovich Aksakov belonged to an old noble Aksakov family whose members claimed to be the decedents of Šimon. Their first documented ancestor was Ivan Feodorivich Velyaminov nicknamed Oksak who lived during the 15th century. His family crest was based on the Polish Przyjaciel coat of arms (also known as Aksak) which is considered to be of Tatar origin in Poland (the word «oksak» means «lame» in Turkic languages). All this led some researches to believe that the Aksakov family also originated from Tatars, despite they had no relation to the Polish noble house. Aksakov's maternal grandfather was a Russian General Semyon Grigorievich Zaplatin who fought under the command of Alexander Suvorov and who married a Turkish captive Igel-Syum.\n\nAksakov was raised on a country estate before he moved to Moscow with his family. He remained with his parents his entire life, without ever marrying or moving out of the house. He studied at Moscow State University, and he became a member of the Stankevitch Circle, a group of Russian Hegelians and early believers of Russian democracy.\n\nAksakov eventually made the acquaintance of Ivan Kireyevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov, adopted their philosophy of Slavophilism and broke off all contact with the Stankevitch Circle.\n\nAksakov's thesis on Mikhail Lomonosov (1846) attempted to synthesize his view of the Russian peasant's religious and historical mission with Hegel's philosophy. Aksakov had influenced Alexander III, giving him his radical understanding that the \"mission of autocracy in Russia is to give a certain well-being to the peasants.\" Later in his career, Aksakov abandoned Hegelian philosophy and became radically anti-European.\n\n"}

Headlined by The Tragically Hip with a different lineup of supporting bands for each of the three tours, the festival traveled across Canada for between eight and ten dates in each of 1993, 1995 and 1997. Each show usually lasted roughly eight hours.\n\nThe name was taken from the Tom Robbins novel \"Another Roadside Attraction\". The Hip were originally thinking of calling it \"Heksenketel\", which is Dutch for \"witches' cauldron\"; although that name was not used for the concert festival, it was later used as the title of a concert video recorded on the 1993 tour.\n\nThe first Another Roadside Attraction in 1993 included Midnight Oil, Crash Vegas, Hothouse Flowers and Daniel Lanois. These five acts also collaborated on a one-off charity single, \"Land\", in 1993 to protest forest clearcutting in British Columbia.

The story chronicles the history of gun culture, gun rights, and gun control in the United States from the early 20th century through the late 1990s. Although clearly a work of fiction, the story is heavily laced with historical fact, including historical figures who play minor supporting roles. The protagonist is very active in competitive shooting sports, as is the author; so unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures, and explanations of firearms-related topics ornament the narrative and drive the plot.\n\nThe cover has a picture of Lady Justice being assaulted by an ATF agent.\n\nThe book was listed by \"The New York Times\"' Sunday Book Review as one of the most sought after out-of-print books of 2013.\n\nThe story hinges upon the enactment and subsequent unintended consequences of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential executive order in 1989, and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.\n\nIts thesis, as discussed in the “Author's Note – A Warning and Disclaimer” in the beginning of the book, is that enough bullying, by what is widely perceived as a hostile occupation government, will inevitably end in revolt if the occupied area is large enough and has a culture that is significantly different from the occupying state, and that this revolt will be undefeatable if the rebels use very low-tech \"leaderless resistance.\"\n\nHenry Bowman is the principal character, although the story begins in 1906, long before Bowman's birth on January 10, 1953. The story is told primarily from his perspective when he is in his early forties. Bowman grows up in the St. Louis, Missouri area, where much of the story takes place. He is a trained geologist, a self-taught expert marksman, a firearms, ammunition, and self-defense authority, and a pilot. Bowman lives on a rural acreage near the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. There is an abandoned stone quarry on his land which Bowman uses for recreational shooting. Bowman, in the novel, enjoys owning performance automobiles and driving at high speed on interstate highways. In one part of the novel, he races his hot-rodded GMC truck against a rival Porsche, with Bowman winning, driving in excess of to win. Bowman also has several forged identities that he uses for various purposes in the novel. Bowman is a proficient skydiver.\n\nWalter \"Blackout\" Bowman is Henry's father. A skilled pilot and U.S. Navy officer, he trained 437 naval aviators during World War II, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander. He represents the studious, responsible, and thoughtful side of the younger Bowman. The author has stated that the elder Bowman is based on his own father.\n\nMax Collins is Bowman's uncle. He is portrayed as a larger-than-life character who is an expert marksman, professional gambler, and accomplished ladies' man. He served in the airborne troops of D-Day, and killed a German army officer in combat with his sniper rifle. In the novel, at a 1960s Nevada shooting competition, he bets on his nephew Henry's shooting, winning $10,000. He represents the adventurous, spontaneous, and aggressive side of the younger Henry Bowman. The author has stated that Collins is based on his own uncle.\n\nIrwin Mann is a survivor of The Holocaust and the Warsaw Ghetto, and a key participant in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. His inclusion in the story permits a study of the use of firearms by average citizens to repel an oppressive government and connects Nazi gun control measures to American gun control efforts.\n\nRay Johnson is a New York City attorney, originally from Aspen, Colorado, who moves to Africa in 1963 and becomes a big-game safari guide. His return to the U.S. in 1994 serves to illustrate how much U.S. gun owners' freedoms have eroded, due to legislation and an executive order enacted during his absence. At the airport, Customs attempts to confiscate an English double rifle worth some US$40,000, a Belgian FN FAL semi-automatic rifle, a Smith & Wesson 2\" Chief's Special revolver, and his hat which has a leopard skin hat band. Ray calls his friend Henry, and Henry calls in a favor with a friend who is a high-ranking Customs official. Ray is allowed to keep his firearms and enter the United States.\n\nAllen Kane is a major machine gun dealer who is Henry's lifelong friend. A major shift in the novel's plot occurs when Henry finds corrupt ATF agents framing Allen, himself, and another firearms dealer. Allen aids and accompanies Henry in much of the novel.\n\nCindy Caswell is a victim of childhood abuse and organized crime who becomes important in the freedom struggle as it develops. She is from Rolla, Missouri. She is abducted by mafia thugs during a trip to Chicago, Illinois, who force her to become a sex slave for mafia bosses and leaders. After several years, she escapes and meets Henry Bowman at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. She assassinates many pro-gun control and big-government politicians and legislators in the novel. The author has been criticized for creating an \"adolescent fantasy\" with this character. Ten years after writing the novel, Ross met Tammy Chapman, whose early life shares a resemblance to that of the fictional Caswell. Ross and Chapman now live together in St. Louis.\n\nThe novel's protagonist, Henry Bowman, shows an early proficiency with firearms, practicing whenever he can find the time. Encouraged by his father, he gathers an impressive firearms collection and gains extensive experience in piloting small aircraft. During college, Bowman is robbed, beaten, and sodomized by a rural gang. The incident nearly destroys him and causes him to become an alcoholic for a period.\n\nWhile at a gun show in Indianapolis, Indiana with friend Allen Kane, Bowman publicly embarrasses an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Wilson Blair. One of Blair's men was trying to trick and entrap a fellow firearms dealer. Blair takes the offense personally, and with the support of the ATF's director, begins to plan revenge. Several years later, Blair and subordinate agents of the ATF plan to frame Henry and his friends as terrorists, smugglers, and counterfeiters. They plan to plant \"evidence\" when the men are away on vacation. Unbeknownst to Blair, Bowman delays his departure at the last minute due to a work commitment, and is on a friend's property when the agents arrive. Bowman assumes the agents are burglars and engages in a gun battle with them, killing or capturing all and in the process discovering the truth about the raid.\n\nBowman realizes that his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped confession of his illegal actions, kills Blair, and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation – whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers – as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to CNN, which claims that Blair and his companions have had a change of heart, realize what they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to rack up the body count.\n\nEventually, as the ATF and FBI are unable to effectively track down those responsible for the killings, the President of the United States is forced to give an address to the nation relating his intent to repeal the unconstitutional laws, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 and Gun Control Act of 1968.\n\nThe story contains several items of historical fiction (accounts of real events with fictionalized thoughts & dialog) that are not widely known and advance the book's premise and plot. The following events are featured prominently:\n\n\nThe novel sold over 60,000 copies of over four printings. After having been out of print for several years, a paperback edition was reissued in June, 2013.\n\nThe author's web site states that he is working on a shorter sequel that was originally scheduled for publication in 2006. However, this sequel has not yet been released.\n\nTimothy McVeigh read the novel while awaiting his trial for the Oklahoma City bombing. He loved the book, and noted that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building:\n\nJohn Ross has posted a response to Timothy McVeigh's comments on his website:\n\n\n"}

The company was formed in 1994 with the merger of DSR-Lines GmbH (Rostock) and Senator Linie GmbH & Co. KG (Bremen).\n\nDSR began in 1956 with service to Finland. Two years later it travelled to Egypt, following that with service to India in 1963. \"\"Senator Linie\"\" was founded in 1985 by Karl Heinz Sager ex CEO of Hapag lloyd and Hans Gerd Gielessen with a chartered fleet of small container ships sailing around the world eastbound and west bound.\nThe company started operating as a subsidiary of Bremer Vulkan and began its operations in April 1987.\n\nIn 1987 a \"Round the World Service\" with 14-day departures was launched. After the German reunification, starting from January 1990, a cooperation with the East German liner shipping company DSR took place, from which the TRICON consortium emerged in June 1990 with the inclusion of the South Korean shipping company Cho Yang Line. The existing container liner services of the three shipping companies were coordinated and aligned. The cooperation between DSR and Senator resulted in 1994 in a merger of the two companies under the name DSR Senator Lines Holding GmbH, in which the German Seereederei Holding and Bremer Vulkan each held 50 percent of the shares. In the same year, the French company Maritime d'Affretement (CMA) and the Belgian CAST Container Line joined the TRICON consortium. \n\nThree years later in 1997, DSR Senator was in financial difficulties, after which the South Korean shipping company Hanjin Shipping, already holding the majority share (80%) of the Senator Line took over (another 10% were each owned by the Bremen investment company BiG, and the Hamburg shipping company F. Laeisz). The TRICON \"Round the World Service\" concept was finally abandoned after the acquisition, and replaced by Pendulum services. In the year 2000 a name change to Senator Lines was decided and further strategic alliances evaluated.\n\nBy combining its container fleet with Hanjin's, the newly created Hanjin-Senator became the seventh largest container shipping company in the world. Senator called on 250 ports in 64 countries all over the world, with a fleet of 113 container vessels.\nFrom 2004, the company increasingly focused on services between Europe and Asia. On the Northern Europe-Asia route, five services were operated in 2007 with 49 vessels with space capacities ranging from 4500 to 9500 TEU. Between the Mediterranean and Asia, 36 ships between 2200 and 5500 TEU were in operation. In addition, there were eight vessels with capacity ranging from 950 to 1500 TEU on the route between the Mediterranean and Montreal in Canada, six ships with an average of 2600 TEU were used between Europe and the ports of the South American East Coast and another four ships with an average of 1600 TEU drove on the Route between Northern Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\nHanjin-Senator announced that they would cease operations at end of February 2009.\n"}
{"id": "1903987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903987", "title": "Commercial sexual exploitation of children", "text": "Commercial sexual exploitation of children\n\nCommercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is a commercial transaction that involves the sexual exploitation of a child, such as the prostitution of children, child pornography, including live streaming sexual abuse, and the (often related) sale and trafficking of children. CSEC may involve coercion and violence against children, economic exploitation, forced labour, contemporary slavery\n\nA declaration of the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, defined CSEC as:\n\nCSEC includes child sex tourism and other forms of transactional sex where a child engages in sexual activities to have key needs fulfilled, such as food, shelter or access to education. It includes forms of transactional sex where the sexual abuse of children is not stopped or reported by household members, due to benefits derived by the household from the perpetrator. CSEC also potentially includes arranged marriages involving children under the age of consent, where the child has not freely consented to marriage and where the child is sexually abused.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) states that roughly one out of every five girls and one out of every ten boys will be sexually exploited or abused before they become of age. UNICEF says that child sexual exploitation is \"one of the gravest infringements of rights that a child can endure\".\n\nChild trafficking and CSEC sometimes overlap. On the one hand, children who are trafficked are often trafficked for the purposes of CSEC. However, not all trafficked children are trafficked for these purposes. Further, even if some of the children trafficked for other forms of work are subsequently sexually abused at work, this does not necessarily constitute CSEC. On the other hand, according to the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the definition of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons includes any commercial sex act performed by a person under the age of 18. This means that any minor who is commercially sexually exploited is defined as a trafficking victim, whether or not movement has taken place. \nCSEC is also part of, but distinct from, child abuse, or even child sexual abuse. Child rape, for example, will not usually constitute CSEC. Neither will domestic violence.\n\nChild pornography is prevalent on the international, national, regional, and local levels. The differences of production, distribution, producers, evasion techniques, and status are explained in figure one. Child pornography is a multibillion-dollar enterprise that includes photographs, books, audiotapes, videos and more. These images depict children performing sexual acts with other children, adults, and other objects. The children are subjected to exploitation, rape, pedophilia, and in extreme cases, murder. \nPornography is often used as a gateway into the sex trade industry. Many pimps force children into pornography as a way of conditioning them to believe that what they are doing is acceptable. The pimps may then use the pornography to blackmail the child and extort money from clients.\n\nChild victims of live streaming sexual abuse are trafficked and then raped or forced to perform sex acts on themselves or other children in real time in front of a webcam. They are usually forced to watch the paying consumers on shared screens and follow their orders. It occurs in locations, commonly referred to as ‘cybersex dens,’ that can be in homes, hotels, offices, internet cafes, and other businesses. Traffickers advertise children on the internet to obtain purchasers.\nOverseas predators and pedophiles seek out and pay for these illicit services. Perpetrators are motivated by money and or sexual gratification.\n\nProstitution is known as one of the youngest professions. Nearly eighty percent of adult prostitutes entered the industry between eleven and fourteen (Cedeno, 2012, p. 157). Children forced or convinced to engage in prostitution often suffer irreparable damage to their physical and mental health. They face early pregnancy and risk sexually transmitted diseases, particularly HIV. They are often inadequately protected by the law and may be treated as criminals.\n\nSome people travel to engage in child sex tourism. Sex tourism and sex trafficking both generate revenue for a country. “The Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand is quoted as asking provincial governors ‘to consider the jobs that will be created .’” This encouragement from the government explains why some countries have low fines for engaging in the sex trade. Many travel agencies offer information and guides on exotic entertainment further encouraging men to travel for sexual purposes. Sex tourists bring money to underdeveloped economies that rely on the exploitation of their women and children for revenue.\n\nThe supply and demand for children in the sex trade industry is greatly influenced by the structure of a country. Kevin Bales says the increase of children sold into prostitution reflects the industrial transformation the country has experienced in the last fifty years. Young girls in Thailand are commonly from northern areas. Because of the harshness of the land and a family’s dependency on a good harvest many families see their daughters as commodities.\n\nOn the macro-level of causes for child sexual exploitation is the globalization of the consumer market and the influx of new goods and services that encourage new forms of consumerism. The amount of money offered to parents for their children is often too good to refuse because they are living at or below the poverty level. The children are turned over to the buyer without any knowledge of what they were sold into.\nOther macro-level influences include the expansion of construction sites and military bases in developing countries. These installations attract those who wish to sexually exploit children for large sums of money. The men who participate in the sexual exploitation of children at these installations are most often from developed countries and have no regard for the children. \"It has been alleged that military personnel figure at a disproportionately high rate in the pedophile exchange lists confiscated by some police departments.\"\n\nFamilies who sell their daughters to brothels tend to repeat the pattern with their younger daughters. The younger daughters, however, are more willing to go. This is because their older sisters tell them stories of their extravagant times in the city. The girls admire their sister's western clothes and money. The younger girls then enter into prostitution with little notion of what they are getting themselves into.\n\nWhether the children be in pornography, brothels, or trafficked they are all at risk for sexually transmitted infections, physical violence, and psychological deterioration. Research has shown that “fifty to ninety percent of children in brothels in Southeast Asia are infected with HIV.” In many cases when children are brought into the sex trade industry they are beaten and raped until they are so broken they no longer try to escape. Physical hazards can also include infertility, cervical cancer, assault, and sometimes murder. Pregnancy is also a physical risk factor for many children. Much like if they are found to have HIV or AIDS the girls are thrown out of the brothels with nowhere to go. Many of the children “break the conscious link between mind and body” in order to function in these situations (Bales 221). By doing so, many children begin to think they are nothing more than \"whores\" and some develop suicidal thoughts. Other psychological risk factors include sleep and eating disorders, gender-disturbed sexual identity, hysteria, and even homicidal rage.\n\nOutside physical and psychological dangers lies fear of the law. Many girls and women are illegally trafficked across borders. If they manage to escape from the brothel or pimp, the women and children quickly come to the attention of the authorities. Because they do not have proper documentation they are detained by the authorities. If they are held in local jails, the women and children often suffer further abuse and exploitation by the police.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know the true extent of the problem, given its illegal nature, International Labour Organization (ILO) global child labour figures for the year 2003 estimate that there are as many as 1.8 million children exploited in prostitution or pornography worldwide.\n\nThe Rapid Assessment survey, developed by the ILO's International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) and UNICEF, relies on interviews and other, mainly qualitative, techniques, to provide a picture of a specific activity in a limited geographic area. It is a highly useful tool for collecting information on the worst forms of child labour, like CSEC, that is difficult to capture with standard quantitative surveys.\n\nGeneral knowledge offered to a child can decrease the likelihood of children being exploited into prostitution or pornography. A national campaign in Thailand provided \"9 years of basic education, ... awareness-raising activities to change attitudes about child prostitution, and a surveillance system to prevent children from being coerced into prostitution.\"\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimate that 2 million children are exploited in prostitution or pornography every year.\n\nECPAT stands for end child prostitution and trafficking. As a non-government organization ECPAT is dedicated to finding ways to save children who are sexually exploited. Their vision is of a world free of child sexual exploitation. One of their efforts includes the First World Congress against the Sexual Exploitation of Children hosted by the Swedish government. The Congress came up with an Agenda for Action which was framed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nECPAT has also helped fund other non-government organizations to establish prevention programs in Thailand and other countries across the globe. On top of funding, ECPAT also produces research reports on the state of child sexual exploitation.\n\nECPAT offers a multitude of involvement opportunities. The cooperation encourages people across the globe to donate and fundraise with them in order to increase the funds used to rescue children and further research efforts. Their page also provides a link to report the commercial sexual exploitation of children. If you plan on travelling they encourage travelers to book with companies who have signed the “Code of Conduct for the protection of children from sexual exploitation in travel and tourism.” Certain businesses and organizations may be eligible to become members of ECPAT. By doing so, organizations can further their efforts to aid against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Most importantly ECPAT encourages everyone to stay informed about the global issue of child sexual exploitation.\n\nWorld Vision is another non-government organization with many areas of impact. World Vision works to address the causes of why child protection is necessary. World Vision educates children who are prime targets to be trafficked. They inform them of the schemes used to lure them into slavery and what trafficking entails. This education empowers the children to have access to education, food, and shelter. World Vision offers many opportunities for citizens to get involved. Their opportunities include sponsoring a child, raising awareness to lawmakers, volunteering at World Vision events, and many more.\n\nAll United Nations member states except for the United States are parties to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which in Article 34 commits countries to prohibiting inducement or coercion of children into unlawful sex acts, prostitution, or pornography.\" The vast majority of countries (which in this case includes the United States) have also ratified the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography which has more detailed commitments on the protection of children in these areas, including reporting and monitoring. UNICEF assisted in the creation of a handbook for the Protocol.\n\nThe same committee that put the Protocol into action has put more effort into acquiring more accurate data on child sexual exploitation. The 2012 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons shows that with the Protocol in place countries without a child sexual exploitation offense have nearly halved. At the regional level, criminal convictions of trafficking offenses have increased.\n\nOn top of the Protocol a Global Plan of Action has been instated. This plan involves strengthening the abilities of law enforcement to identify victims of trafficking, enhance investigations of alleged cases, and prosecute and punish the many corrupt officials who partake in sex trafficking and tourism.\n\nOne of the many ways to aid in the prevention of child sexual exploitation is through education. World Vision is one of the leaders in educating young girls on the dangers of trafficking and educating them on what they would really be getting themselves into. Other efforts involve educating police personnel. The Family Planning Association of Nepal hosted a training session for the local police on how to handle a trafficking situation and how to identify women and children in sexual exploitative situations. Public education is also a must. Because child sexual exploitation is driven by demand it is “crucial to raise the perceptions of consumers about the harm that is caused.” It has been suggested that public shutdowns of those who operate sex tours could influence deterrence. Other efforts include simply educating potential victims about the tactics recruiters often use. The previously mentioned Protocol requires members to provide preventative measures against child sexual exploitation; among these preventative measures is educating the public, especially families, on the dangers of sex tourism and trafficking.\n\n\nRelevant ILO Conventions and Recommendations\n\n\n"}

The route is a north–south four-to-six lane suburban roadway, lying between the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) and San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605), and connecting the eastern parts of Long Beach and Pasadena via the Whittier Narrows. Since 1998, several pieces have been relinquished to local governments, and more transfers are authorized by state law. The portion of SR 19 north of the Whittier Narrows is officially State Route 164, once planned to be upgraded as the Rio Hondo Freeway, but has always been signed as part of SR 19.\n\nSR 19 and SR 164 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nLakewood Boulevard (no longer SR 19 in Long Beach) begins at the Long Beach Traffic Circle, where State Route 1 (Pacific Coast Highway) heads west and southeast, and Los Coyotes Diagonal heads northeast. It heads north past Interstate 405, passing under a runway of the Long Beach Airport. (The part through the airport has been relocated to the east; parts of the old alignment remain as airport service roads.) Lakewood Boulevard (no longer SR 19 in Lakewood) passes to the west of Lakewood Center Mall before passing through the neighborhood of Mayfair.\n\nAs the sections of SR 19 in Long Beach and Lakewood have been relinquished, SR 19 now legally begins at the city of Bellflower at the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard and Rose Street. SR 19 in Bellflower will be relinquished by the state to the city. SR 19 intersects State Route 91 before straddling the city border between Bellflower and Paramount and later Bellflower and Downey. North of Gardendale Street, SR 19 has been relinquished to the city of Downey.\n\nIn Downey, Lakewood Boulevard intersects with Interstate 105 before passing by the large site formerly occupied by North American Aviation, Rockwell International and Boeing Reusable Space Systems and interchanging with Interstate 5. At Telegraph Road at the Downey-Pico Rivera line, Lakewood Boulevard turns into Rosemead Boulevard. Upon changing to Rosemead Boulevard, SR 19 enters Pico Rivera. This portion of SR 19 has been relinquished to the city as well. Rosemead Boulevard then continues through Pico Rivera past Pico Rivera Plaza to Gallatin Road.\n\nThe 9.56-mile (15.39 km) piece of SR 19 north of Gallatin Road in Pico Rivera has been State Route 164 since the 1964 renumbering, but has always been signed as SR 19. Original plans for SR 164 took it southeast to Interstate 605 from the present transition between SR 164 and SR 19, and it was originally planned as the Rio Hondo Freeway. SR 164 begins as Rosemead Boulevard, leaves the city of Pico Rivera, and enters an unincorporated area.\n\nSR 164 travels across Whittier Narrows Dam before entering the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area and intersecting with the cloverleaf interchange of State Route 60. After this, SR 164 enters South El Monte before crossing the Rio Hondo and straddling the city boundary between Rosemead and El Monte. SR 164 then intersects with Interstate 10 before passing by Rosemead Shopping Center. The next section of SR 164 was relinquished to Temple City in 2008.\n\nUpon leaving Temple City, the maintenance of SR 164 transfers to the county, for this segment of SR 164 has been relinquished. Rosemead Boulevard continues north to Interstate 210. Presently, the north end of the route is at I-210 about a mile south of Sierra Madre Villa Avenue. Originally planned as a freeway, it was to be the intermediate north–south freeway between I-710 (the Long Beach Freeway) and I-605 (the San Gabriel River Freeway). Today, locals generally refer to this road as either Lakewood Boulevard or Rosemead Boulevard, not by its numerical designation. The portion of Rosemead Blvd. between Gallatin Rd. in Pico Rivera and Interstate 10 is built to expressway standards.\n\nBus service is provided by Metro Local line 266 (between Foothill Boulevard and Del Amo Boulevard) and Long Beach Transit line 111 (south of Del Amo Boulevard) throughout Rosemead Boulevard and Lakewood Boulevard. The Metro Green Line is also provided by a station in the median of Interstate 105 under Lakewood Boulevard.\n\nBefore the present SR 19 was constructed, San Gabriel Boulevard, which extended from Lamanda Park south to Downey, and was widened and repaved by an assessment tax in 1925, was the main road through the Whittier Narrows, requiring several turns to stay on it and to continue south to Long Beach. The state legislature added Route 168 to the state highway system in 1933, which followed this general alignment between Route 60 (SR 1) in Long Beach and Route 9 (Foothill Boulevard, then US 66) near Lamanda Park.\n\nSR 19 was designated out of the 1964 state highway renumbering. However, since then, many segments of SR 19 have been relinquished to the cities that they run through. Caltrans relinquished Long Beach's portion of SR 19 to the city on January 27, 1999, and Downey's segment of SR 19 was relinquished to the city on July 3, 2001. However, the segment in Pico Rivera was not relinquished to that city until June 22, 2004. On October 27, 2006, the northern portion of SR 164 that went through an unincorporated area of the county from Callita Street to I-210 was relinquished to the county. In April 2008, the section of SR 164 through Temple City was relinquished to that city. On April 9, 2012, the section of SR 19 through Lakewood was relinquished to that city. In 2017, the relinquishment process in Bellflower has started.\n\n \n"}

It is also called random telegraph noise (RTN), popcorn noise, impulse noise, bi-stable noise, or random telegraph signal (RTS) noise.\n\nIt consists of sudden step-like transitions between two or more discrete voltage or current levels, as high as several hundred microvolts, at random and unpredictable times. Each shift in offset voltage or current often lasts from several milliseconds to seconds, and sounds like popcorn popping if hooked up to an audio speaker.\n\nPopcorn noise was first observed in early point contact diodes, then re-discovered during the commercialization of one of the first semiconductor op-amps; the 709. No single source of popcorn noise is theorized to explain all occurrences, however the most commonly invoked cause is the random trapping and release of charge carriers at thin film interfaces or at defect sites in bulk semiconductor crystal. In cases where these charges have a significant impact on transistor performance (such as under an MOS gate or in a bipolar base region), the output signal can be substantial. These defects can be caused by manufacturing processes, such as heavy ion implantation, or by unintentional side-effects such as surface contamination.\n\nIndividual op-amps can be screened for popcorn noise with peak detector circuits, to minimize the amount of noise in a specific application.\n\nBurst noise is modeled mathematically by means of the telegraph process, a Markovian continuous-time stochastic process that jumps discontinuously between two distinct values.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1903999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903999", "title": "2003 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "2003 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2003 Pacific hurricane season was the first season to feature no major hurricanes – storms of Category 3 intensity or higher – since 1977. It produced an unusually large number of tropical cyclones which affected Mexico. The most notable cyclones during the year were Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty, which killed 2 and 12 people in Mexico, respectively, and were collectively responsible for about US$1 billion (2003 USD) in damage. Three other Pacific storms, two of which were hurricanes, and three Atlantic storms also had a direct impact on Mexico. The only other significant storm of the season was Hurricane Jimena, which passed just to the south of Hawaii, the first storm to directly threaten Hawaii for several years.\n\nThe season officially started on May 15, 2003, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and on June 1, 2003, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2003. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw 16 tropical storms form, of which 7 became hurricanes, which is about average. Damage across the basin reached $129 million (2003 USD), while 23 people were killed by the various storms.\n\nOn June 12, 2003, NOAA published a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, the first time it had done so. The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below normal activity this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which is the opposite of its effect in the Atlantic.\n\nOn May 19, 2003, NOAA published its forecast for the Central Pacific hurricane season. The forecast called for a slightly below-average level of activity in 2003, due to the same forecast of the onset of La Niña which would later prompt the low forecast for the Eastern Pacific.\n\nThere were 16 named storms and 7 hurricanes during the 2003 Pacific hurricane season, which is comparable with the long-term averages. However, there were no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale); this was the first time this had happened in the eastern Pacific since 1977, and is well below the long-term average of four. The first hurricane, Ignacio, formed on August 24. This is the latest formation of the first hurricane of a season recorded in the east Pacific since reliable satellite observation began in 1966.\nWhilst the total activity was below average, there was an unusually high number of landfalls in Mexico. A total of eight Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclones had a direct impact in Mexico in 2003, second only to 1971, when 9 did so. This is well above the long-term average of 4.2 Atlantic and east Pacific storms affecting Mexico. Five Pacific storms impacted Mexico, of which Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty both hit the state of Baja California Sur as hurricanes. The combined damage from the two hurricanes totaled about US$1 billion (2003 USD). Two other storms hit mainland Mexico as tropical storms and a third as a tropical depression. Three storms hit Mexico within a very short space of time, the Pacific hurricanes Nora and Olaf, and the Atlantic Tropical Storm Larry. As a result of the flooding caused by these storms, disaster areas were declared in 14 states.\n\nActivity in the Central Pacific was below average, with only one tropical depression forming in the basin and one hurricane entering the basin from the east Pacific. In addition, a third system, Tropical Storm Guillermo, weakened to a remnant low just to the east of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Although activity was generally low, Hurricane Jimena was the first direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands for several years and a hurricane watch was issued for the island of Hawaii. Jimena passed to the south, but still brought tropical-storm-force gusts and heavy rain to the island.\n\nA tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on May 19 well to the south of Mexico as it moved west. A good outflow developed and it became a tropical storm the next day, before reaching its peak strength with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Increasing shear prevented any further development as the storm moved quickly west-northwest. On May 25, the shear and a reduction in water temperatures weakened Andres to a tropical depression, and it dissipated soon after. The storm did not approach land.\n\nTropical Depression Two-E formed when an organized tropical wave interacted with another disturbance near the southwestern Mexican coast early on June 17. The storm strengthened and became Tropical Storm Blanca 12 hours later. The storm moved slowly to the west and reached its peak on June 18 with 60 mph (95 km/h) winds. Although Blanca never developed a true eye, at its peak there was a ring of convection resembling one. Under the influence of strong shear from the southeast, Blanca began to weaken and move erratically. The storm degenerated to a remnant low on June 22 and lasted a further two days. There were no effects from Blanca on land.\nTropical Storm Carlos formed on June 26 from a tropical wave to the south of Mexico. It quickly strengthened as it approached the coast, and early on June 27 Carlos moved ashore in Oaxaca with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). The storm rapidly deteriorated to a remnant low, which persisted until dissipating on June 29. Carlos brought heavy rainfall to portions of southern Mexico, peaking at 337 mm (13.3 in) in two locations in Guerrero. Throughout its path, the storm damaged about 30,000 houses, with a monetary damage total of $86.7 million pesos (2003 MXN, US$8 million 2003 USD). At least nine people were killed throughout the country, seven due to mudslides and two from river flooding; there was also a report of two missing fishermen.\n\nConvection developed within an area of low pressure embedded in a tropical wave as it moved west. The disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 6 well to the south-southwest of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula. It soon strengthened further into Tropical Storm Dolores as it moved to the northwest and reached its peak as a minimal tropical storm with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). However, wind shear had an adverse effect on Dolores, and it weakened back into a depression 12 hours after becoming a tropical storm. The northwest motion brought it over colder water and it dissipated on July 9.\n\nOn July 10, a tropical wave formed into Tropical Depression Five-E. The storm became more organized and was named Tropical Storm Enrique the next day at an unusually high latitude. The storm continued to strengthen and at one point was forecast to briefly become a hurricane. This did not occur as the storm reached its peak strength with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds. It maintained this strength before moving over significantly cooler water late on July 12. Due to the cold water temperatures Enrique rapidly weakened, despite favorable atmospheric conditions. The storm degenerated into a remnant low late on July 13 and continued to move west before dissipating after a further 3 days. Enrique had no effects on land, but there were two ship reports of tropical storm force winds.\n\nA tropical wave passed over Central America on July 12 and started to become more organized two days later. It formed into a tropical depression on July 17 as it continued to move to the west. The depression became Tropical Storm Felicia the next day and as there was low shear over the system, the NHC predicted that it would become a minimal hurricane. However, the storm remained disorganized and peaked with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds late on July 18. The storm gradually weakened under increasing shear as it headed west, weakening back to a tropical depression on July 20. The remnant low entered the central Pacific before dissipating on July 24 well to the east of Hawaii. Felicia had no effect on land.\n\nA weak surface low developed within a tropical wave on August 6 and the convection associated with it became isolated from that of the wave. The circulation of the system became better defined and a Tropical Depression, Seven-E, formed early the next day. Although the depression was initially forecast to dissipate quickly, it became more organized as it moved to the west. On August 8 it became Tropical Storm Guillermo and it reached its peak strength with 60 mph (95 km/h) winds that day. It maintained this strength for a full day, until outflow from the developing Tropical Storm Hilda to its east disrupted its convection. The remnant low entered the central Pacific shortly before dissipating on August 13.\n\nA tropical wave developed persistent thunderstorm activity on August 5, which soon became more organized, forming into Tropical Depression Eight-E to the south of Cabo San Lucas. An impressive outflow pattern caused the NHC to predict an intensification to hurricane strength, but strong easterly shear affected the system. The depression became Tropical Storm Hilda on August 10 but did not get any stronger than a minimal tropical storm with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Hilda moved west-northwest before it moved over colder waters, which caused it to weaken. Low-level flow forced the weakening cyclone westwards and it dissipated on August 13, having never approached land.\n\nThe only tropical cyclone to form in the central Pacific in 2003 developed on August 15, and resulted from an interaction between remnants of Tropical Storm Guillermo and a non-tropical low. Unfavorable wind shear prevented the development of the depression and weakened as it drifted to the west. It weakened to a remnant low on August 17 and never regained depression strength. The remnant passed just south of Johnston Atoll before it crossed the International Date Line on August 20. The storm had a minimal effect on the weather of the Hawaiian Islands.\nA tropical wave organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather just south of the Mexican port of Manzanillo, Colima, on August 22 and gradually moved to the northwest. It became Tropical Depression Nine-E off Cabo Corrientes in the state of Jalisco two days later and under the influence of favorable atmospheric conditions rapidly strengthened. It was named Tropical Storm Ignacio on August 25 before it peaked as a 105 mph (165 km/h) hurricane on August 26, the first of the season. Ignacio entered the southern Gulf of California before it made landfall just to the east of La Paz, Baja California Sur. Ignacio weakened overland and dissipated early on August 28 over central Baja California.\n\nDue to the storm's slow movement, rainfall was high and the resulting flooding was severe, and Ignacio was responsible for approximately US$21 million of damage. Two rescue workers drowned in the flood waters brought by the storm and some 10,000 people were evacuated to shelters.\nOn August 28, an area of disturbed weather within the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E, some 1725 miles (2775 km) east of the Hawaiian Islands. The storm rapidly developed over warm ocean waters, gaining an eye shortly before it became Hurricane Jimena on August 29. The storm moved to the west, entering the central Pacific as it continued to strengthen. After reaching its peak strength with 105 mph (165 km/h) winds 800 miles (1300 km) to the east of Hawaii it began to weaken as a result of increased shear. The storm passed about 120 miles (195 km) to the south of the southern tip of Hawaii on September 1, just after losing hurricane strength. The storm then moved west, south of the archipelago, becoming a tropical depression on September 3. The weakening Jimena crossed the International Date Line before dissipating on September 5.\n\nThe storm brought 6 to 10 inches (150 to 250 mm) of rain and 11 foot (3.3 m) surf to the island of Hawaii. There were also tropical storm force winds recorded on several of the Hawaiian Islands, but there was no significant damage.\n\nA large low pressure area developed within a tropical wave and organized slowly into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 3 south-southwest of the tip of Baja California. The broad wind field prevented rapid intensification and the system reached tropical storm strength on September 4. Although wind shear was light, Kevin weakened into a depression after just six hours, as it moved over colder waters. On September 6 the system degenerated to a non-convective low pressure area, which managed to survive for four days before finally dissipating. Tropical Storm Kevin had no effects on land.\n\nConvection began to increase in a tropical wave on September 9 and a few days later a surface low developed. On September 12 it organized into Tropical Depression Twelve-E to the southwest of the Mexican port of Manzanillo, Colima. The cyclone moved to the northwest, becoming a tropical storm on September 14 before reaching its peak strength as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds. The National Hurricane Center predicted further strengthening, but this did not occur and Linda weakened back to a tropical storm after just 12 hours as a hurricane. As the storm continued to weaken it turned to the west and then to the southwest, becoming a tropical depression on September 17. The remnant drifted to the southwest and finally dissipated on September 26. There were no reports of any effects from this storm.\nA tropical wave moved into the Pacific Ocean on September 10 and the convection associated with it gradually increased. By September 16, while the system was south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, it organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E. The depression strengthened as it headed towards the Baja California Peninsula, becoming a tropical storm on September 19 and a hurricane two days later. Hurricane Marty reached its peak strength on September 22, just before it made landfall at Cabo San Lucas, when it was packing winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). After moving over the southern tip of the peninsula Marty moved up the western coast of the Gulf of California, gradually weakening as it did so. The storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 23 and dissipated two days later after meandering over the northern Gulf.\n\nHurricane Marty was the deadliest storm of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season and was responsible for 12 deaths and either damaged or destroyed over 4,000 homes. It brought heavy rainfall to the entire region and some rain affected the Southwest United States. A 5-foot (1.5 m) storm surge flooded parts of La Paz, Baja California Sur, and sank 35 yachts moored in various ports. Marty was also the costliest east Pacific storm of the year and was responsible for US$50 million of damage in western Mexico.\nA tropical wave moved over Central America on September 25 and moved parallel to the south Mexican coast. It became more organized on October 1 and developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. It continued to strengthen as it moved northwest in favorable conditions, becoming a tropical storm the next day. On October 4 it became a hurricane and reached its peak that day with 105 mph (165 km/h) winds. Nora made a sharp turn to the east and began to weaken, as the result of the influence of a mid-level trough and the outflow from Hurricane Olaf to the southeast. The cyclone rapidly weakened before it made landfall just north of Mazatlán, Sinaloa, on October 9. Nora dissipated over land soon after landfall. Hurricane Nora was the strongest storm of the season and brought heavy rain to the state of Sinaloa, but there was no significant damage or casualties.\nA tropical wave became increasingly organized on October 2 to the south-southeast of Acapulco and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E the next day. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Olaf six hours after forming as it moved to the northwest in a low shear environment. Olaf reached its peak strength as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds on October 5 and developed a partial eyewall. The storm soon became disorganized and was only a hurricane for a few hours, before turning towards the Mexican coast. Olaf made landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, on October 7 and soon dissipated overland.\n\nThe storm caused severe flooding in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato which damaged crops, roads and over 12,000 houses. However, there were no deaths as a result of Hurricane Olaf.\n\nOn October 20 the convection associated with a tropical wave became more organized, and Tropical Depression Sixteen-E formed to the south of Acapulco. It soon became Tropical Storm Patricia and reached hurricane strength on October 21, as it moved further west. 12 hours later, its winds had increased to 80 mph (130 km/h) and the NHC forecast further strengthening. However, on October 22, increasing westerly shear caused Patricia to weaken to below hurricane strength. The storm weakened further to a depression on October 25, and it dissipated the next day, ending the season. Hurricane Patricia had no effects on land.\nThe following list of names was used to name storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2003. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. No names were retired by the World Meteorological Organization, therefore this list was used again in the 2009 season. This is the same list which was used for the 1997 season except for Patricia, which replaced Pauline. The name \"Patricia\" was previously used in 1970 and 1974.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2003 are shown below; however, none of them were used.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2003 USD.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904001", "title": "2002 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "2002 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2002 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly above average Pacific hurricane season that saw three tropical cyclones reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale, tied for the most in a season with 1994 and 2018. The strongest storm this year was Hurricane Kenna, which reached Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta, located in the Mexican state of Jalisco, on October 25. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico, and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast, despite remaining offshore.\n\nThe season officially began on May 15 for the Eastern Pacific, and June 1 for the Central Pacific. It ended on November 30 for both regions. These dates delimit the time when most tropical cyclones form in this part of the Pacific Ocean. The first system formed on May 24 and the final depression dissipated on November 16.\n\nOther storms were individually unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity, but neither caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto had no effect on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude.\n\nThe season was active, partly due to a El Niño, a meteorological weather phenomenon, that produces favorable conditions across the Pacific ocean, such as lower wind shear, and higher sea surface temperatures.\n\nThere were 15 tropical storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean in the 2002 season. Of those, eight became hurricanes, of which six became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Three reached Category 5 intensity, a record shared with the 1994 season. Four tropical depressions formed and dissipated before reaching the intensity of a tropical storm. In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, one tropical storm and two hurricanes formed, with one of the hurricanes intensifying into a major hurricane. In the eastern Pacific proper, the season saw below average activity in terms of the number of total storms and hurricanes, but about average activity in terms of major hurricanes. Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a measure of the activity of a hurricane season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 10. The total ACE of the season was 101*10 kn in the east Pacific proper. This qualifies the 2002 season as near to slightly above normal.\n\nA moderately strong El Niño, ongoing during the season, may have contributed to the disproportionate number of major hurricanes, as well as reduced activity in the Atlantic. Also of note was an unusual gap in storm formation during the first three weeks of August in this season, historically a prime period for tropical cyclone formation.\n\nOnly three systems, Tropical Storms Boris and Julio and Hurricane Kenna, had significant impact on land. Julio and Kenna caused the only two landfalls this year. Most of the season's impact, including all casualties and most of the damage, was caused by Kenna.\n\nIn addition to the above systems, an area of convection persisted near a developing circulation about west-southwest of Johnston Atoll on July 18. An upper-level low to the northeast provided outflow, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert early on July 19. Although not classified by the CPHC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) remarked that a tropical depression had developed by early on July 20, just east of the International Date Line. Soon after, it crossed into the western Pacific and briefly intensified into Tropical Storm Kalmaegi. Also on October 30, the JMA indicated that Tropical Storm Maysak moved into the basin and became extratropical few hours later. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA complex formation involving a tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression \"One-E\" on May 24. It slowly strengthened into the first tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving near the edge of a subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category 3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter under the influence of wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.\n\nThe hurricane did not impact land. A special feature about Alma was that it was one of only five Pacific major hurricanes in May.\n\nOn June 8, an area of disturbed weather that had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression \"Two-E\". It became a tropical storm the next day. After peaking on June 9, with a pressure of 997 mb, steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure. Shear increased, and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10. The next day, Boris degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12.\n\nBoris dumped heavy rains on sections of the Mexican coast. The maximum amount was at San Felipe Usila. These rains damaged several homes at an unspecified location. In addition, rainfall damaged several homes in Tequila, Jalisco, but the National Hurricane Center believes that Boris likely did not cause the rain. No deaths were attributed to this storm.\n\nA tropical wave that crossed Central America organized and developed into a tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds for a few more days before dissipating.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather near Panama drifted to a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression \"Four-E\" on July 9. It moved westward through a hostile environment of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named \"Cristina\". This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned to the north and peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.\n\nA tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on July 8 and crossed the Atlantic without much development. In the Caribbean, showers increased, but wind shear prevented development. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific on July 16, and wind shear decreased to allow the convection to organize. Tropical Depression Five-E developed on July 20 about south of Manzanillo, Mexico. At that time, gradual strengthening was anticipated. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Douglas. Around that time, most of the deep convection was situated south of the atmospheric circulation. Initially expected to become a hurricane only briefly, late on July 21, the NHC reported that Douglas had become a hurricane. Upon becoming a hurricane, Douglas was situated in low wind shear environment; however, Hurricane Douglas was expected to reach cold waters in 36 hours, and thus was not predicted to become a major hurricane. Douglas became a Category 2 hurricane on July 22, reaching peak winds of . Douglas held this intensity for 18 hours as it traveled westward. When Douglas weakened from its peak intensity, it had an organized cloud pattern, but the thunderstorm activity was weakening, typical of most Pacific hurricanes that reach cooler waters. The weakening briefly stopped after Douglas went through an eyewall replacement cycle, but Douglas was downgraded to a tropical storm late on July 24 as the storm only had a small area of deep convection left. Tropical storm Douglas briefly stopped weakening as convection increased, only to fade away again hours later. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression early on July 26, and later that day degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The remnant low dissipated the next day.\nA tropical wave generated into Tropical Depression \"Six-E\" on July 23. It moved westward and reached storm strength 12 hours after it formed. Elida rapidly deepened, developing a pinhole eye, and becoming a hurricane on July 24 and further reaching major hurricane intensity six hours later. Elida's rapid intensification continued, becoming a Category 5 hurricane for six hours on July 25.\n\nDespite moving over warm waters, Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall replacement cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened. Elida fell to a tropical storm on July 27, then degenerated into a remnant low and turned to the northeast. The remnant dissipated over the open ocean about 535 mi (861 km) west of Los Angeles.\n\nElida is one of the fastest intensifying eastern Pacific hurricanes. Its rate of intensification is rivaled only by 1997's Linda, 2015's Patricia, and 2018's Norman. Elida had no direct impact on land. However, it did send heavy waves along the shores of Mexico. No one was killed and no damage was reported.\n\nA tropical wave that had reached the Eastern Pacific from Africa was first spotted on July 23. The wave continued westward with little development occurring until August 3, when convection increased. After additional slow organization, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression \"Seven-E\" on August 6 near the tip of Baja California. The system did not strengthen much, and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8. The depression never came near land and hence no one was killed or injured. Like Tropical Depression Three-E, this cyclone was forecast to reach tropical storm intensity, but it never did.\nAfter a rather lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a tropical wave formed Tropical Depression \"Eight-E\" on August 21. Initially taking a westward track, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm \"Fausto\" on August 22. It turned to the west-northwest and stayed on that path for the next six days. Fausto steadily strengthened and intensified into a hurricane on August 22. It continued to intensify, peaking as a Category 4 on August 24, and also substantially increased in size. The hurricane began to weaken thereafter, and was a minimal tropical storm by the time it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 27. The tropical cyclone dropped to a depression and degenerated into a non-convective swirl of clouds on August 28.\n\nFausto's remnants passed north of the Hawaiian Islands uneventfully until they interacted with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) on August 30. In combination with warm waters, a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed. At this time it was located around latitude 30°N. By September 1, Fausto had redeveloped into a tiny but tropical ministorm. Its rebirth was brief, however, as a mid-latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3.\n\nFausto's regeneration north of Hawaii was unusual but not unprecedented. The other time this happened since 1966 was in the 1975 season. That time, another TUTT absorbed the remnant of Hurricane Ilsa, which led to the formation of an unnamed hurricane at high latitude. Other tropical cyclones have strengthened north of Hawaii, but the actual formation of one is rare.\n\nAn area of convection acquired a closed circulation and became Tropical Depression \"One-C\" on August 22. It stayed disorganized for the next several days. It organized more fully and intensified into a tropical storm on August 25 and was named \"Alika\". After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.\n\nA tropical wave formed Tropical Depression \"Nine-E\" on August 26. It was upgraded to a tropical storm and named \"Genevieve\" the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted for a few more days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAn eastern extension of the monsoon trough south of Hawaii organized into Tropical Depression \"Two-C\" on August 27 and strengthened into Tropical Storm \"Ele\" six hours later. Despite the nearby presence of Alika, Ele developed rapidly and strengthened into a hurricane on August 28. After contributing to the dissipation of Alika, Ele continued intensifying. It reached Category 2 intensity late on August 28 and quickly became a major hurricane six hours later. The hurricane then crossed the International Date Line and became a typhoon in the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. Typhoon Ele turned to the northwest after crossing the dateline and continued to strengthen. It reached Category 4 before turning north and weakening again. After briefly restrengthening back into a Category 4, the typhoon weakened and turned to the northwest. Ele was downgraded to a tropical storm on September 7, a depression on September 9, and then dissipated shortly afterwards. Ele did not affect land.\nA weak wave in the ITCZ organized into Tropical Depression \"Ten-E\" on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into a tropical storm and eventually, a hurricane. Hernan then began rapidly deepening, reaching Category 5 intensity on September 1. It maintained that intensity for 12 hours before tracking over cooler waters. The storm weakened steadily, with wind shear contributing to its deterioration. Hernan then degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. The low turned to the southwest and dissipated three days later.\n\nHernan passed close enough to Socorro Island to bring strong winds to the island. In addition, the hurricane's large and powerful wind field caused waves between and in height and strong rip currents on the southwest coast of California. Other than the aforementioned regions, Hernan had no significant impact on land.\n\nOf the four tropical depressions this season that did not become named storms, only Eleven-E threatened land. An area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave formed into a tropical cyclone on September 5. It tracked northwestward, before turning southwest. It weakened into a remnant low on September 8. The remnant turned north and dissipated on September 10 offshore of the Baja California peninsula. The cyclone was nearly a tropical storm when it peaked on September 6. It was forecast to become a tropical storm and pass close to the peninsula. This prompted a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch. With the weakening of the cyclone the watch and warning were discontinued. No damage or casualties were reported in association with this tropical cyclone.\n\nPart of the same tropical wave that formed Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic basin organized into Tropical Depression \"Twelve-E\" on September 15. It strengthened further into Tropical Storm \"Iselle\" the next day. The storm headed northwest and paralleled the coast of Mexico, nearly strengthening into a hurricane late on September 17. While near its peak intensity, a trough abruptly recurved the system to the northeast. Wind shear also increased, and Iselle consequently fell apart on satellite imagery. It weakened to a depression on September 19. Iselle then degenerated into a remnant low the next day and rapidly degenerated, dissipating on September 20. Iselle never made landfall.\n\nIselle threatened parts of southwestern Mexico and warnings and watches were issued for that area. Heavy rains were reported over parts of the Baja California Peninsula. The highest amount of rainfall was at Guadeloupe and Mulege, Baja California Sur. There were no reports of damage or casualties.\nAn area of convection and disturbed weather, possibly related to outflow from Hurricane Isidore in the Atlantic basin, developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression \"Thirteen-E\" on September 25. The depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm that same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked in intensity as a minimal tropical storm near Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. On September 26, Julio made landfall. The storm rapidly dissipated over Mexico.\n\nThree fatalities were reported from Julio. However, in Guerrero, around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding. The highest rainfall reported was at Zihuatanejo and La Unión, Guerrero.\nA disturbance possibly associated with a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression \"Fourteen-E\" on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category 5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category 4 by the time of its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.\n\nHurricane Kenna was the third-strongest Pacific hurricane to make landfall on record. It was also the second-strongest October hurricane in any season, and the third strongest Pacific hurricane overall. In San Blas, Nayarit, 8,800 people were affected; 1,540 houses were damaged or destroyed, which was 80% to 90% of houses in the town. In Santiago Ixcuintla, 3,770 houses were damaged. Agriculture in the affected area was disrupted. Farmers required aid, and many fruit crops were destroyed. Tourism in Puerto Vallarta was disrupted, with much of the damage to hotels. Insurance companies reported that Kenna's total damage was $96 million (2002 USD).\n\nKenna killed four people in Mexico and injured over a hundred. The low death toll is likely due to massive evacuations in San Blas, Nayarit, and elsewhere ahead of the hurricane.\n\nA weak tropical wave located over the open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression \"Fifteen-E\" on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. The proximity of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.\n\nIn late October, an active monsoon trough persisted south of Hawaii along 10°N latitude, developing an area of convection on October 24. Later that day, the disturbance was classified as Tropical Depression \"Three-C\" about south-southeast of Honolulu. Initially poorly organized, it moved to the north and steadily intensified, becoming Tropical Storm \"Huko\" early on October 26 while turning northwestward. Late on October 28, Huko reached hurricane strength, but its close proximity to Tropical Storm Lowell and a brief increase in wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm on October 30. Shortly after turning to the west, conditions allowed for Huko to re-attain hurricane strength on October 31 while it was passing around south of Johnston Atoll. On November 2, a ridge caused the hurricane to accelerate, and the next day it crossed the International Date Line into the Western Pacific, becoming a typhoon.\n\nWhile passing near Johnston Atoll, the outer rainbands of the hurricane produced wind gusts up to and locally heavy rainfall. The remnants of Huko later reentered the basin, eventually affecting California. The system was responsible for heavy rains, causing flooding along a small stream in Bakersfield. Total damage was approximately $23,000 (2002 USD).\n\nTropical Depression Sixteen-E formed from a disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone. Despite being located in a hostile environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that from occurring. Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean during 2002. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2008 season. This is the same list used for the 1996 season. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2002 are shown below. Three of them, \"Alika\", \"Ele\", and \"Huko\", were used throughout the course of the year.\n\nOn March 31, 2003, at the 25th session of the RA IV hurricane committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name \"Kenna\" from its rotating name lists due to the deaths and damages it caused, and it will not be used again for another Pacific hurricane. \"Kenna\" was replaced with \"Karina\" for the 2008 Pacific hurricane season.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2002 USD.\n\n\n"}

There are two types of magnetosonic waves, the \"fast\" magnetosonic wave and the \"slow\" magnetosonic wave. Both fast and slow magnetosonic waves have been recently discovered in the solar corona, which created an observational foundation for the novel technique for the coronal plasma diagnostics, coronal seismology.\n\nIn an ideal homogeneous plasma of infinite extent, and in the absence of gravity, the magnetosonic waves form, together with the Alfvén wave, the three basic linear MHD waves. Under the assumption of normal modes, namely that the linear perturbations of the physical quantities are of the form formula_1 (with formula_2 the constant amplitude), a dispersion relation of the magnetosonic waves can be derived from the system of ideal MHD equations:\n\nformula_3,\n\nwhere formula_4 is the Alfvén speed, formula_5 is the sound speed, formula_6 is the magnitude of the wave vector and formula_7 is the component of the wave vector along the background magnetic field (which is straight and constant, because the plasma is assumed homogeneous).\n\nThis equation can be solved for the frequency formula_8, yielding the frequencies of the fast and slow magnetosonic waves:\n\nformula_9.\n\nIt can be shown that formula_10 (with formula_11 the Alfvén frequency), hence the name of \"slow\" and \"fast\" magnetosonic waves.\n\nIn the absence of a magnetic field, the whole MHD model reduces to the hydrodynamics (HD) model. In this case formula_12, and hence formula_13 and formula_14. The slow wave thus disappears from the system, while the fast wave is just a sound wave, propagating isotropically.\n\nIn case the plasma is incompressible, the sound speed formula_15 (this follows from the energy equation) and it can then be shown that formula_16 and formula_17. The slow wave thus propagates with the Alfvén speed (although it remains different from an Alfvén wave in its nature), while the fast wave disappears from the system.\n\nUnder the assumption that the background temperature formula_18, it follows from the perfect gas law that the thermal pressure formula_19 and thus that formula_20. In this case, formula_13 and formula_22. Hence there are no slow waves in the system, and the fast waves propagate isotropically with the Alfvén speed.\n\nIn the case of an inhomogeneous plasma, i.e. a plasma where at least one of the background quantities is not constant, the MHD waves lose their defining nature and get mixed properties. In some setups, such as the axisymmetric waves in a straight cylinder with a circular basis (one of the simplest models for a coronal loop), the three MHD waves can still be clearly distinguished. But in general, the pure Alfvén, fast and slow magnetosonic waves don't exist and the waves in the plasma are coupled to each other in intricate ways.\n\n"}

The term \"wave front\" was coined by Lars Hörmander around 1970.\n\nIn more familiar terms, WF(\"f\") tells not only \"where\" the function \"f\" is singular (which is already described by its singular support), but also \"how\" or \"why\" it is singular, by being more exact about the direction in which the singularity occurs. This concept is mostly useful in dimension at least two, since in one dimension there are only two possible directions. The complementary notion of a function being non-singular in a direction is \"microlocal smoothness\".\n\nIntuitively, as an example, consider a function ƒ whose singular support is concentrated on a smooth curve in the plane at which the function has a jump discontinuity. In the direction tangent to the curve, the function remains smooth. By contrast, in the direction normal to the curve, the function has a singularity. To decide on whether the function is smooth in another direction \"v\", one can try to smooth the function out by averaging in directions perpendicular to \"v\". If the resulting function is smooth, then we regard ƒ to be smooth in the direction of \"v\". Otherwise, \"v\" is in the wavefront set.\n\nFormally, in Euclidean space, the wave front set of ƒ is defined as the complement of the set of all pairs (\"x\",\"v\") such that there exists a test function formula_1 with formula_2(\"x\") ≠ 0 and an open cone Γ containing \"v\" such that the estimate\nholds for all positive integers \"N\". Here formula_4 denotes the Fourier transform. Observe that the wavefront set is conical in the sense that if (\"x\",\"v\") ∈ Wf(ƒ), then (\"x\",λ\"v\") ∈ Wf(ƒ) for all λ > 0. In the example discussed in the previous paragraph, the wavefront set is the set-theoretic complement of the image of the tangent bundle of the curve inside the tangent bundle of the plane.\n\nBecause the definition involves cutoff by a compactly supported function, the notion of a wave front set can be transported to any differentiable manifold \"X\". In this more general situation, the wave front set is a closed conical subset of the cotangent bundle \"T\"(\"X\"), since the ξ variable naturally localizes to a covector rather than a vector. The wave front set is defined such that its projection on \"X\" is equal to the singular support of the function.\n\nIn Euclidean space, the wave front set of a distribution ƒ is defined as\n\nwhere formula_6 is the singular fibre of ƒ at \"x\". The singular fibre is defined to be the complement of all directions formula_7 such that the Fourier transform of \"f\", localized at \"x\", is sufficiently regular when restricted to an open cone containing formula_7. More precisely, a direction \"v\" is in the complement of formula_6 if there is a compactly supported smooth function φ with φ(\"x\") ≠ 0 and an open cone Γ containing \"v\" such that the following estimate holds for each positive integer \"N\":\n\nOnce such an estimate holds for a particular cutoff function φ at \"x\", it also holds for all cutoff functions with smaller support, possibly for a different open cone containing \"v\".\n\nOn a differentiable manifold \"M\", using local coordinates formula_11 on the cotangent bundle, the wave front set WF(\"f\")\nof a distribution ƒ can be defined in the following general way:\n\nwhere the singular fibre formula_6 is again the complement of all directions formula_7 such that the Fourier transform of \"f\", localized at \"x\", is sufficiently regular when restricted to a conical neighbourhood of formula_7. The problem of regularity is local, and so it can be checked in the local coordinate system, using the Fourier transform on the \"x\" variables. The required regularity estimate transforms well under diffeomorphism, and so the notion of regularity is independent of the choice of local coordinates.\n\nThe notion of a wave front set can be adapted to accommodate other notions of regularity of a function. Localized can here be expressed by saying that \"f\" is truncated by some smooth cutoff function not vanishing at \"x\". (The localization process could be done in a more elegant fashion, using germs.)\n\nMore concretely, this can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n\nTypically, sections of \"O\" are required to satisfy some growth (or decrease) condition at infinity, e.g. such that formula_24 belong to some L space.\nThis definition makes sense, because the Fourier transform becomes more\nregular (in terms of growth at infinity) when \"f\" is truncated with the smooth cutoff formula_2.\n\nThe most difficult \"problem\", from a theoretical point of view,\nis finding the adequate sheaf \"O\" characterizing functions belonging to a given subsheaf \"E\" of the space \"G\" of generalized functions.\n\nIf we take \"G\" = \"D\"′ the space of Schwartz distributions and want to characterize distributions which are locally formula_26 functions, we must take for \"O\"(Ω) the classical function spaces called \"O\"′(Ω) in the literature.\n\nThen the projection on the first component of a distribution's wave front set is nothing else than its classical singular support, i.e. the complement of the set on which its restriction would be a smooth function.\n\nThe wave front set is useful, among others, when studying propagation of singularities by pseudodifferential operators.\n\n\n"}

It existed in a mountainous region of modern-day Fujian province of China and had a history of quasi-independent rule. Its capital was Fuzhou. It was founded by Wang Shenzhi.\n\nWang Shenzhi’s older brother Wang Chao was given the title of Surveillance Commissioner in 892. Wang Shenzhi himself was named military commissioner, and in 909, in the wake of the collapse of the Tang Dynasty two years earlier, named himself the Prince of Min. Wang Shenzhi’s son declared himself the Emperor of Min in 933. At that point, his father was posthumously named Min Taizu.\n\nThe early Chinese exonym () was a graphic pejorative written with Radical 142 , the \"insect\" or \"reptile\" radical. Xu Shen's (c. 121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" dictionary defines \"min\" as: \"Southeastern Yue [i.e., Viet]; snake race. [The character is formed] from [the] insect / serpent [radical and takes its pronunciation from] \"\".\n\nThe capital of the Min Kingdom was Changle, now known as Fuzhou. The kingdom was essentially limited to modern-day Fujian Province in China’s southeast.\n\nThe territory of the Min was relatively isolated and rugged, thus not as economically prosperous as other regions of the Chinese realm. The Min court attempted to attract scholars that would assist in constructing an effective bureaucratic and tax system to bring the kingdom up to contemporary standards. Maritime trade developed over this period of time. This would set the stage for a successful regional maritime trade that could continue during future Chinese dynasties.\n\nIn 943, one of Wang Shenzhi’s sons rebelled and declared independence from the Min in the northwest of the territory of the kingdom, proclaiming the Yin dynasty. The Min court asked the Southern Tang for assistance in quelling the rebellion in Yin. Rather than assisting the Min government, the Southern Tang came in and absorbed the territory into its own holdings.\n\nSeeing the threat posed by the Southern Tang, the Min court declared its allegiance to the Wuyue kingdom to its north. However, this did not stop the Southern Tang from marching in and incorporating the remainder of the Min Kingdom into its holdings in 945.\nHowever, in the year 949, the warlord Liu Congxiao, who nominally submitted to him but controlled Quan (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and Zhang (漳州, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures in de facto independence and ruled by several of those generals called Qingyuan Jiedushi in succession until 978, when the territory was seized by Song Dynasty.\n\n"}

The film focuses on an aging \"Don Juan\" who embarks on a cross-country journey to track down four of his former lovers after receiving an anonymous letter stating that he has a son. The film stars Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton, Julie Delpy, Mark Webber, Chloë Sevigny, Christopher McDonald and Alexis Dziena.\n\nDon Johnston (Bill Murray), a former \"Don Juan\" who made a small fortune in the computer industry, wants to live in quiet retirement. He is content to lounge around watching old movies and listening to classical or easy listening music. His current girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy), is ending their relationship and moving out of his house when a letter in a pink envelope arrives.\n\nAfter she walks out, Don reads the letter; it purports to be from an unnamed former girlfriend, informing him that he has a son who is nearly nineteen years old, and who may be looking for him. Initially, Don does not intend to do anything about it, but his busybody neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), who is a mystery novel enthusiast, urges Don to investigate. Winston researches the current locations of the five women most likely to have written the letter and gives Don the information along with maps and flight reservations, and persuades him to visit them.\n\nUltimately Don meets with four women (the fifth one had died before the events of the film), each encounter worse than the last and each woman damaged in some way:\n\nLater, Don stops at a florist to buy flowers from a young woman named Sun Green (Pell James) who treats his cut. Don leaves the flowers at the grave of the fifth woman, Michelle Pepe.\n\nFinally, Don returns home where he finds a pink letter from Sherry, admitting she still likes him. He discusses the trip and second letter with Winston, who theorizes that Sherry might have written the original letter as a hoax. He then goes home to compare the two letters.\n\nDon then meets a young man in the street (Mark Webber) who he suspects may be his son. He buys him a meal, but when he remarks that the young man believes that Don is his father, the young man becomes agitated and flees. Don attempts to chase the man but gives up, standing in the middle of a crossroads. Don watches a Volkswagen Beetle drive past from which a young man (Bill Murray's son, Homer Murray) in the passenger seat makes eye contact with Don, while the same music Don has listened to on his trip plays from the passing car.\n\nThe story was left deliberately unresolved. Director Jim Jarmusch had each of the four female leads write their own pink paper letter \"in character\" to plant in each one's mind the possibility that she was the mother of Don's supposed son. (The letter used in the film was a composite of the four.) In relation to the ending, Jarmusch said that the film is about \"yearning for something that you're missing and not necessarily being able to define what it is\".\n\nSlates for the film shown on the DVD extra \"Broken Flowers: Start to Finish\" list the title of the film as \"Dead Flowers.\"\n\nThe film is dedicated to French director Jean Eustache. In an interview, Jarmusch said he felt close to Eustache for his commitment to making films in a unique and independent fashion.\n\nReed Martin sued Jarmusch in March 2006, claiming that the director stole the film's concept from a very similar script that had circulated among several people eventually involved in the production. Jarmusch denied the charges and stated in response that Martin's claim has \"absolutely no merit\". On September 28, 2007, a federal district court judge dismissed Martin's lawsuit.\n\n\"Broken Flowers\" premiered in Europe at 2005 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2005. It opened on August 5, 2005 in the US in a limited release. It was released on video January 3, 2006.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on August 5, 2005 earning $780,408 from 27 theaters. After 15 weeks in release, the movie ended with a domestic total of $13,744,960. The film fared much better internationally, taking in $32,975,531 to bring its total gross to $46,720,491.\n\nAt the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, the film was nominated for the \"Palme d'Or\" and won the \"Grand Prix\". Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of 194 surveyed critics wrote a positive review, with an average rating of 7.49/10.The site's critical consensus reads: \"Bill Murray's subtle and understated style complements director Jim Jarmusch's minimalist storytelling in this quirky, but deadpan comedy.\"\n\nAccording to Ken Tucker, \"\"Broken Flowers\" relies on Bill Murray's persona, but it also turns that persona back on him. Instead of maintaining the satirical distance that made it easy to laugh at heartland eccentrics in, say, Alexander Payne's \"About Schmidt\", Jarmusch's film avoids caricature, and Murray's poker face melts. Don feels a bittersweet regret at becoming exactly the sort of granite-faced wise guy Bill Murray has made his rep at enshrining. Murray is at a point in his career when his self-effacement has achieved high comic art, and he collaborates with Jarmusch at a point in his career when he's trying to be something more than hipster-serene. Both succeed, by committing to the notion that a yearning to be reborn within a hopeless, brittle soul is worthy of drama—as well as a deeper, gentler humor.\"\n\nPeter Bradshaw called it \"Jarmusch's most enjoyable, accessible work for some time, perhaps his most emotionally generous film - like Cronenberg, he has made a bold venture into the mainstream with a movie that creates a gentle cloud of happiness. It is, it must be said, a lot more forgiving about aging men than Alexander Payne's road-movies \"About Schmidt\" or \"Sideways\", but it is still a very attractive piece of film-making, bolstered by terrific performances from an all-star cast, spearheaded by endlessly droll, seductively sensitive Bill Murray.\"\n\nThe soundtrack to the film features an eclectic mix of music, chiefly using instrumentals by Ethiopian jazz artist Mulatu Astatke as the main score, mixed with garage rock (The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Greenhornes, Holly Golightly), stoner metal (Sleep), soul (Marvin Gaye), rocksteady reggae (The Tennors), and classical (Gabriel Fauré's \"Requiem\").

{"id": "1904018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904018", "title": "Louis Majorelle", "text": "Louis Majorelle\n\nLouis-Jean-Sylvestre Majorelle, usually known simply as Louis Majorelle, (26 September 1859 – 15 January 1926) was a French decorator and furniture designer who manufactured his own designs, in the French tradition of the \"ébéniste\". He was one of the outstanding designers of furniture in the Art Nouveau style, and after 1901 formally served as one of the vice-presidents of the \"École de Nancy\".\n\nLouis Majorelle is one of those who contributed the most to the transformation of furniture. Thanks to posterity, we recognize today a piece of furniture from him as we recognize a piece of furniture from André Charles Boulle and Charles Cressent, the french Prince regent's favorite artists. During the early 18th century, Cressent replaced the magnificence of ebony and tortoiseshell associated with tin and copper by the softer harmonies of foreign woods. Like him, Louis Majorelle dressed the elegant structure of Art Nouveau furniture with exotic wood inlays. \n\nThe palette he composed with wood from France and abroad, resembles that of a painter. Oak, walnut, ash, elm, holly, plane, chestnut, cherry, pear and beech provide the soft tones and the enveloping range of grays; they serve Majorelle in calm and deliberately monochrome compositions. Rosewood provides the delicate colors and patterns of the flower. The tender yellow lemon tree, the silver maple, the purple amaranth, dear to Cressent, the jacaranda wood, the red satin, the amourette, the orange clairembourg, the black or green ebony, the red or black palm, etc., constituted for him, among the foreign essences, the most extensive colored swell, where his painter instincts could flourish.\n\nMajorelle was born in Toul. In 1861, his father, Auguste Majorelle (1825 – 1879), who himself was a furniture designer and manufacturer, moved the family from Toul to Nancy. There, Louis finished his initial studies before moving to Paris in 1877 for two years of work at the École des Beaux-Arts. On the death of his father, he cut short his studies and returned to Nancy to oversee the family's manufactories of faience and furniture. This would occupy him for the rest of his life.\n\nOn 7 April 1885, Majorelle married Marie Léonie Jane Kretz (06/12/1864 – 31/12/1912), daughter of the director of the municipal theaters in Nancy. Their only child, Jacques Majorelle, who himself would become an artist, was born 7 March 1886.\n\nThe Majorelle firm's factory was designed by famous \"École de Nancy\" architect Lucien Weissenburger (1860 – 1929) and located at 6, rue du Vieil-Aître in the western part of Nancy. In the 1880s Majorelle turned out pastiches of Louis XV furniture styles, which he exhibited in 1894 at the \"Exposition d'Art Décoratif et Industriel\" [Exposition of Decorative and Industrial Art] in Nancy, but the influence of the glass- and furniture-maker Emile Gallé (1846 – 1904) inspired him to take his production in new directions. Beginning in the 1890s, Majorelle's furniture, embellished with inlays, took their inspiration from nature: stems of plants, waterlily leaves, tendrils, dragonflies. Before 1900 he added a metalworking atelier to the workshops, to produce drawerpulls and mounts in keeping with the fluid lines of his woodwork. His studio also was responsible for the ironwork of balconies, staircase railings, and exterior details on many buildings in Nancy at the turn of the twentieth century. Some of his original woodwork designs can still be found in Grand Hotel Moderne, Lourdes. Often collaborating on lamp designs with the Daum Frères glassworks of Nancy, he helped make the city one of the European centers of Art Nouveau. At the apogee of the Belle époque, during the 1900 Paris World's Fair (Exposition Universelle), Majorelle's designs triumphed and drew him an international clientele. By 1910, Majorelle had opened shops for his furniture in Nancy, Paris, Lyon, and Lille.\n\nIn February 1901, Majorelle became one of the founding members of the \"École de Nancy\", alternatively known as the \"Alliance provinciale des industries d'art\", which was a group of artists, architects, art critics, and industrialists in Lorraine who decided to work in a collaborative fashion, and predominantly in the Art Nouveau style. They, headed by Gallé (until his death in 1904, and thereafter by Victor Prouvé) did this for several reasons, chief among which was to ensure a high standard of quality of work in the French decorative arts, of which Lorraine artists were the chief producers at the time. Majorelle was one of the vice-presidents of the group from the outset, remained so throughout the existence of the \"École de Nancy\", and was certainly considered one of the group's leaders. For the most part, he and the other members worked to promote the work of Lorraine decorative artists through their advocacy of the establishment of a school for industrial arts, their participation at major exhibitions (as well as organizing their own shows), and through their collaborative efforts on individual art pieces and buildings, almost all of which were in the Art Nouveau style, and which helped produce to some extant a unity among the art and architecture produced by Lorrainers. Majorelle was consistently one of the internationally renowned figures of the group who could always be found at any show at which the group exhibited. His connections with the Parisian art circles also helped assure the renown of Lorraine artists in the French capital. The \"École de Nancy\", however, was often in short supply of funding, and the formal artistic cooperation among its members slowly seemed to disintegrate during the First World War.\n\nIn 1898, Majorelle hired Henri Sauvage (1873 – 1932), a young Parisian architect, to collaborate with Weissenburger on the building of his own house, known as the Villa Jika (after the acronym of Majorelle's wife's maiden name), but now popularly known as simply the Villa Majorelle, in Nancy. Majorelle, like many industrialists in Nancy, located his house across the street from his factory, but in a relatively new area of town, the large parcel of land which it occupied made it seem like a veritable country estate. His house and factory were located on land that was given to him by his mother-in-law, Madame Kretz.\n\nSauvage and Weissenburger's three-story design for the villa represents the true flowering of Art Nouveau architecture in Nancy, with multiple bow windows and floral motifs covering the exterior. Majorelle himself produced the ironwork, furniture, and the interior woodwork, such as the grand staircase. Majorelle located his own personal studio on the third floor under a gabled roof, and included a huge arched window combled together with spandrels that evoke the branches of a tree or flower. Most of the floral motifs seen in the house use the forms of the \"monnaie-du-pape\" plant. In addition, Majorelle employed Jacques Gruber to create the original stained glass for the house, and on the interior, the artisans created impressive painted friezes in the dining room, which contains a large ceramic Art Nouveau fireplace designed by Alexandre Bigot.\n\nIn 1914, with the outbreak of war, Majorelle hoped to hold out and continue production in Nancy. Unfortunately, in an event apparently unrelated to the war, his factories on the rue du Vieil-Aître suddenly caught fire on the morning of 20 November 1916. The conflagration, no doubt spurred on by the fresh supply of lumber, unfinished furniture, and sawdust, burned virtually all the firm's sketches, awards, molds, equipment, and archives that documented the fifty-year history of the enterprise. As if to add insult to injury, a year later, in 1917 German aircraft bombing of Nancy destroyed the Majorelle shop on the rue Saint-Georges. The Majorelle family reported that their shop in Lille had been looted by advancing German troops.\n\nMajorelle relocated to Paris for the remainder of the war, where he worked in the workshops of fellow furniture designers. After the war, he reopened the factory and his shop, and continued to collaborate with the Daum glassworks and produce furniture, though these late designs show the stiffened geometry of Art Deco.\n\nMajorelle died in Nancy in 1926 in his beautiful property on rue du Vieil-Aître, leaving to his brothers Jules and Pierre, the management of the store on rue Saint-Georges in Nancy and the sawmill of Bouxières-aux-Dames. After his death, his family, whose fortunes had been damaged severely by the war, could no longer afford to live in the Villa Majorelle, and the house and much of the outlying property were sold off in parcels. Majorelle's factories closed in 1931. Eventually, the villa went through several architectural modifications (aside from those Majorelle himself made while he resided there), including the addition of a concrete bunker near the rear and the enclosure of the front terrasse.

The name Cloister was at first selected until it was discovered that Yale already had an institution of similar name. About that time the document known as the Charter for the College of New Jersey was found and presented to the University. Charter's current neighbor to the west, Cloister Inn, later took the discarded name.\n\nA small building on Olden Street—known as the \"Incubator\" because several other clubs had started there while they waited for sufficient finances to buy or build a proper clubhouse—was leased and the furnishing paid for by subscriptions.\n\nIn the spring of 1903 the Club purchased three lots and a house on Prospect Avenue which constitutes three-quarters of the present property. The house was redesigned and enlarged under the supervision of an undergraduate member David Adler of the 1904 Section, with the assistance of Professor Harris of the Faculty. The funds for the purchase of this property and the alterations to this second clubhouse were raised by the sale of nineteen $1,000 mortgage bonds.\n\nThe \"Adler Clubhouse\" would house Charter Club for a decade, until the present \"Third Clubhouse\", designed by architectural firm Mellor & Meigs was completed in the fall of 1914. Additionally, Charter's real estate assets had grown. In early 1905, at least one adjacent lot was purchased. In the summer of 1905, a squash court was built behind the clubhouse. The expansion of the land holdings encouraged the membership and graduate section of Charter to build the Third Clubhouse, which was and is a far more imposing edifice than either the Adler Clubhouse or even the \"Incubator\". Today, Charter is widely regarded as having one of the finest clubhouses on \"The Street.\"\n\nAfter the United States entered World War I, Charter was temporarily closed due to reduced membership caused by widespread member enlistment in the armed forces. For a period of less than two years, between 1917 and 1919, the Charter clubhouse closed its doors, and Charter members left on campus received full membership privileges at Cottage Club. Charter lost seven members in the war, and their sacrifice is commemorated by a plaque located in the \"Great Room.\"\n\nReopening in 1919, Charter quickly gained a reputation as a club personifying the era of the Roaring '20s, carving a niche for itself on campus in the inter-war years. World War II saw Charter closing along with all of its peer institutions, as members almost universally went off to fight abroad. Charter greatly expanded its membership after the war, but disaster struck closer to home in 1949 when a fire spread rapidly through much of the first and second floors causing heavy damage. A fire marshal summoned to the scene of the fire, on seeing the facade of Charter seemingly unaffected, declared famously, \"I have never seen a building survive a fire like this, nothing is indestructible, but this place is damn near.\" Charter's membership has since often referred to it as \"The Indestructible Charter Club,\" or simply \"The Indestructible.\"\n\nCharter was known throughout the 1950s and 1960s for its hard partying ways—Charter parties were only rivaled at the time by those at perennial animal house Cannon Club. It is suspected, but not known, that at least one Charter member rode with members of Cap and Gown Club in the so-called Great Train Robbery of '63, in which the \"dinky\" train running from Princeton Junction into Princeton was forced to make a dramatic emergency stop after a car was seen on the tracks, at which point ersatz cowboys rode up to the train on horseback and carried off their dates who had been arriving for the weekend.\n\nThe greatest era of the Eating Clubs was beginning to fade by the late sixties, however, and looking to prop up stagnating membership figures, Charter announced that it would accept female members, over the objection of many members of the grad board, shortly after the University made the switch to coeducation. In 1977, Charter made the switch from bicker selectivity to sign-in openness in order to draw more members. The club remained financially stable throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, as six of its peers shut their doors permanently.\n\nThroughout this tumultuous period, Charter never quite lost its carefree atmosphere and wild touch—best exemplified perhaps by the infamous Initiation Night of 1988. In 1988, Charter counted as members most of the Varsity Football Team, including many of the '89 section's officers. It was some of these gridiron heroes who allegedly planned the raucous celebration of the admission of the new sophomore section which led to 45 members sent to McCosh Infirmary or Princeton Medical Center for alcohol-related reasons. The Princeton Borough Police quickly rounded up the Charter officer corps, and criminal charges were brought against the president and social chair, who were convicted of serving alcohol to minors, fined $500, and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The sentences were later overturned by a Mercer County Court judge, and the two undergraduate officers received probation and were ordered to perform community service. To prevent a similar occurrence, but also to commemorate forever this fateful night, Charter now conducts formal initiations a week after all the other eating clubs, and on what would otherwise be initiation night officially \"goes dry.\" Initiation Night '88 is generally considered to be, along with the Section Party of 1930, one of Charter's most infamous moments.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Charter announced major modifications to its membership admission system, creating a \"weighted sign-in\" system that gives preference to sophomores judged to be more enthusiastic about the club, based on their involvement in club activities and attendance at events open to sophomores.\" In February 2011, operating under this new system, Charter was again the only sign in club to fill its sophomore section in the first round of sign-ins.\n\n\n"}

It is the oldest and the largest circulated Tamil Newspaper in Sri Lanka. Virakesari is owned by Express Newspapers (Ceylon) (Private) Limited, a leading print and web media organization in Sri Lanka.\n\n\"Virakesari\" was founded by PPR. Subramanian in the first half of 20th century. Subramanian was an entrepreneur and journalist from the village Avanipatti in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nUpon immigrating from India to British Ceylon, he saw the conditions of the Indian Labourers and decided that he would establish a newspaper to promote justice and equality for those people by publishing a newspaper with a distinct voice of its own.\n\nThe first edition was published on 6 August 1930 under the masthead \"Virakesari\" meaning \"Victorious Lion\" . Subramanian guided the publication for over 20 years, during which the publication focused on the rights and grievances of the Plantation workers, capturing the attention of the Tamil speaking population. Today, this newspaper is the most widely circulated and read newspaper by the entire Tamil speaking population in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1948, soon after Ceylon obtained independence from British dominance, the Ceylon Parliament enacted the Ceylon Citizenship Act. Faced with the choice of obtaining Ceylonese citizenship or continuing with his Indian citizenship, Subramanian chose to return to his homeland, unable to come to terms with losing his nationality. Before his departure, he sold his interests to a small group of Ceylonese Citizens of Indian origin.\n\nIn 1965, during the period of political upheaval in Sri Lanka, the Virakesari newspaper was taken over by a Sinhalese political party with the intention of introducing a Sinhalese national newspaper. However, as fate would have it, the company was sued for defamation compelling the new owners to relinquish control, reverting ownership to the earlier owners.\n\nIn 1970, Express Newspapers (Ceylon) Limited was registered as a private company and as publisher of the Virakesari newspaper. It was the intention of the Directors that as a company, expansion programs could provide for a wide range of Tamil language publications for the Tamil speaking population.\n\nToday, \"Virakesari\" has evolved into a national newspaper with the motto \"Tharamana Valiyil Thelivaana Thagaval\" [\"Quality news with clarity\"].\n\nExpress Newspapers (Ceylon) Limited also publishes a wide range of magazines and newspapers catering to the different sectors and markets of the Tamil speaking population.\n\nThe Online Division of Express Newspapers launched virakesari.lk, a 24x7 breaking news website, in 2002, and in 2005 they launched \"Virakesari's\" E-paper, which was the world's first Tamil E-paper. The websites boasts of over 2.5 million hits from across the world. \"Virakesari\" also plays a significant role in the field of social media having large numbers of young audience engaged on their websites.\n\n\nVirakesari was voted the \"Best Designed Newspaper\" at the \"Journalism Awards for Excellence 2005\" by the Editors Guild and the Sri Lanka Press Institute. In 2010 virakesari.lk won the title of \"Sri Lankas' Favorite Tamil Website\" in polling conducted by bestweb.lk.\n\nDue to the significant numbers of SriLankan Tamil population (diaspora) spread across the world, \"Virakesari\" has become a world-renowned name in Tamil. \"Virakesari\" has a Weekly edition printed in Doha and distributed around the states of Middle East. The \"Sunday Virakesari\" is distributed in over 15 countries including United States, Canada, UK, France, Germany, India, Middle East, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n"}

She was the first Fijian woman to serve as Leader of the Opposition. She previously held the position of deputy Prime Minister in the Qarase-led Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) government from 2001 to 2006. As the paramount chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy, she holds the title \"Roko Tui Dreketi\".\n\nKepa is originally from Lomanikoro, Rewa, and has maternal links to Nadroga. She graduated from the University of the South Pacific with a Bachelor of Arts, and served as Principal of Corpus Christi College and then as a students' coordinator at the University of the South Pacific.\n\nShe succeeded her late sister, former Ro Lady Lala Mara, as \"Roko Tui Dreketi,\" or Paramount Chief of Burebasaga, in 2004. This is considered to be the highest title in the Burebasaga Confederacy, one of three \"confederacies\", or tribal networks, of Fijian chiefs.\n\nRo Teimumu Kepa is the widow of Sailosi Kepa, a former High Commissioner to London, Minister of Justice and Attorney General (1988–1992), who went on to become a High Court Judge, Ombudsman, and first chairman of Fiji's Human Rights Commission.\n\nIn July 2016, Kepa was awarded a Peace Award by the Universal Peace Federation in Nepal and was accorded as a Global Peace Ambassador or Ambassador for Peace.\n\nIn 1999 Kepa was appointed to the Senate. Following the 2000 Fijian coup d'état she was appointed as Minister for Women, Culture, and Social Welfare in the interim government of Laisenia Qarase. She contested the 2001 election as a candidate for the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua in the Rewa communal constituency, winning it with 2,636 votes. Following the election she was appointed as Minister for Education.\n\nOn 5 May 2005 she was elected as chairperson of the Rewa Provincial Council, a position previously held by her sister Ro Lady Lala Mara. This led to claims that she had forfeited her seat in Parliament, resulting in her resigning from the council in August 2005.\n\nIn October 2005, Kepa was elected to the executive board of UNESCO, to which the Fijian government had nominated her in late September.\n\nKepa stood again for Rewa in the 2006 election, defeating her nephew, Ro Filipe Tuisawau. She was reappointed as Minister for Education, Youth and Sports in the multi-party cabinet. When the Qarase government was deposed by the 2006 Fijian coup d'état, Kepa joined a court case challenging the legality of the coup. She also used her position in the Great Council of Chiefs to oppose the coup, and was instrumental in the Council's 2007 rejection of Epeli Nailatikau nomination as Vice-President. As a result, the Council was suspended.\n\nIn May 2007, Kepa was threatened by the military over her opposition to the coup. However she continued to speak out against the regime and its People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress. In July 2009 she was arrested and charged with breaching public emergency regulations and conspiracy to cause disorder after offering that her province would host the annual conference of the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma, which the military regime had banned. The charges were later dropped. In 2011 the military regime suspended the Rewa Provincial Council in another effort to silence her.\n\nIn March 2014 Kepa was elected leader of the newly formed Social Democratic Liberal Party. She led the party into the 2014 election. The party won 15 of the 50 parliamentary seats; Kepa, who won 49,485 votes in her own name, was the second-highest ranked candidate behind Bainimarama. On 6 October 2014 Kepa was appointed Leader of the Opposition.\n\nIn June 2016, Kepa announced that she was standing down as leader of SODELPA. She was replaced by former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. She was re-elected in the 2018 elections, winning 6,036 votes, the second-highest of any female candidate.\n"}

The Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1987 was given to Donald J. Cram, Jean-Marie Lehn, and Charles J. Pedersen for their efforts in discovering and determining uses of cryptands and crown ethers, thus launching the now flourishing field of supramolecular chemistry. The term cryptand implies that this ligand binds substrates in a crypt, interring the guest as in a burial. These molecules are three-dimensional analogues of crown ethers but are more selective and strong as complexes for the guest ions. The resulting complexes are lipophilic.\n\nThe most common and most important cryptand is N[CHCHOCHCHOCHCH]N; the systematic IUPAC name for this compound is 1,10-diaza-4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane. This compound is termed [2.2.2]cryptand, where the numbers indicate the number of ether oxygen atoms (and hence binding sites) in each of the three bridges between the amine nitrogen caps. Many cryptands are commercially available under the tradename Kryptofix. All-amine cryptands exhibit particularly high affinity for alkali metal cations, which has allowed the isolation of salts of K.\n\nThe three-dimensional interior cavity of a cryptand provides a binding site – or host – for \"guest\" ions. The complex between the cationic guest and the cryptand is called a cryptate. Cryptands form complexes with many \"hard cations\" including , lanthanoids, alkali metals, and alkaline earth metals. In contrast to crown ethers, cryptands bind the guest ions using both nitrogen and oxygen donors. This three-dimensional encapsulation mode confers some size-selectivity, enabling discrimination among alkali metal cations (e.g. Na vs. K).\n\nCryptands are more expensive and difficult to prepare, but offer much better selectivity and strength of binding than other complexants for alkali metals, such as crown ethers. They are able to bind otherwise insoluble salts into organic solvents. They can also be used as phase transfer catalysts by transferring ions from one phase to another. Cryptands enabled the synthesis of the alkalides and electrides. They have also been used in the crystallization of Zintl ions such as .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904053", "title": "Marxism", "text": "Marxism\n\nMarxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that views class relations and social conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and takes a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.\n\nDifferent Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Many schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts which has then led to contradictory conclusions. It has been argued that there is a movement toward the recognition that historical materialism and dialectical materialism remains the fundamental aspect of all Marxist schools of thought. This view is refuted by some post-Marxists such as Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, who claim that history is not only determined by the mode of production, but also by consciousness and will.\n\nMarxism has had a profound impact on global academia and has influenced many fields such as archaeology, art history, anthropology, media studies, science studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, ethics, criminology, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, film theory, critical psychology and philosophy.\n\nThe term Marxism was popularized by Karl Kautsky, who considered himself an orthodox Marxist during the dispute between the orthodox and revisionist followers of Marx. Kautsky's revisionist rival Eduard Bernstein also later adopted use of the term. Engels did not support the use of the term Marxism to describe either Marx's or his views. Engels claimed that the term was being abusively used as a rhetorical qualifier by those attempting to cast themselves as real followers of Marx while casting others in different terms such as Lassallians. In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed Marxist Paul Lafargue by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered Marxist, then \"one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist\".\n\nMarxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain social phenomena within any given society. It assumes that the form of economic organization, or mode of production, influences all other social phenomena—including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a base and superstructure. As forces of production, i.e. technology, improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As Karl Marx observed: \"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution\". These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society which are, in turn, fought out at the level of the class struggle.\n\nUnder the capitalist mode of production, this struggle materializes between the minority (the bourgeoisie) who own the means of production and the vast majority of the population (the proletariat) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that social change occurs because of the struggle between different classes within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that capitalism exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a proletarian revolution. In a socialist society, private property—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, production would be carried out directly for use. As Friedrich Engels said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".\n\nMarxian economics and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for falling rates of profit by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The socialist system would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' revolution. According to Marxian crisis theory, socialism is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.\n\nThe materialist theory of history analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the base and superstructure.\n\nThe base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: \"The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society\" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political \"forms of social consciousness\" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure. This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a dialectic, expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes\".\n\nMarx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:\n\nAccording to the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, \"the principal content of Marxism\" was \"Marx's economic doctrine\". Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that \"the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are ... one and the same\", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that \"the fastest possible growth of productive capital\" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.\n\nExploitation is a matter of surplus labour—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the means of production enables its exploitation of the other classes. In capitalism, the labour theory of value is the operative concern; the value of a commodity equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, surplus value (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term \"surplus labour\", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker. In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the \"voluntary\" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.\n\nAlienation is the estrangement of people from their humanity (German: \"Gattungswesen\", \"species-essence\", \"species-being\"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers. In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.\n\nMarx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of means of production and control over the labour power of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the social stratification of the capitalist mode of production with the following social groups:\n\nClass consciousness denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nWithout defining ideology, Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, \"ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces\". Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In \"The German Ideology\", he says \"[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force\".\n\nThe term political economy initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.\nThis new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the \"means of production\" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and (by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace) create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.\n\nMarx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. Capitalism, in which the product of the worker's labour is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labour costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest amount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.\n\nThrough common ownership of the means of production, the profit motive is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is the property of the society as a whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared.\n\nAccording to orthodox Marxist theory, the overthrow of capitalism by a socialist revolution in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the Russian revolution of 1917, Lenin wrote: \"The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society ... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour\". The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg towards an appreciation of Marx's crisis theory and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.\n\nClassical Marxism denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. \"Marxism\", as Ernest Mandel remarked, \"is always open, always critical, always self-critical\". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between \"Marxism\" as broadly perceived and \"what Marx believed\", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader Jules Guesde and to Marx's son-in-law Paul Lafargue—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of \"revolutionary phrase-mongering\" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.\n\nFrom Marx's letter derives the paraphrase \"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist\". American Marxist scholar Hal Draper responded to this comment by saying: \"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike\". On the other hand, the book \"Communism: The Great Misunderstanding\" argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large part, this was due to the fact that \"The German Ideology\", in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe theoretical development of Marxist archaeology was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled \"For a Soviet history of material culture\". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier Joseph Stalin, a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country. These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic V. Gordon Childe (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.\n\nMarxist sociology is the study of sociology from a Marxist perspective. Marxist sociology is \"a form of conflict theory associated with ... Marxism's objective of developing a positive (empirical) science of capitalist society as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary working class\". The American Sociological Association has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is \"interested in examining how insights from Marxist methodology and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society\". Influenced by the thought of Karl Marx, Marxist sociology emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century. As well as Marx, Max Weber and Émile Durkheim are considered seminal influences in early sociology. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as Austro-Marxism, of which Carl Grünberg and Antonio Labriola were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the Western Marxist school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the Frankfurt School or critical theory. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in post-communist states (see sociology in Poland) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see sociology in China).\n\nMarxian economics is a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical political economy first expounded upon by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of crisis in capitalism, the role and distribution of the surplus product and surplus value in various types of economic systems, the nature and origin of economic value, the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of economic evolution. Although the Marxian school is considered heterodox, ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to capital accumulation and the business cycle, such as creative destruction, have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.\n\nMarxist historiography is a school of historiography influenced by Marxism. The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of social class and economic constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the working class, oppressed nationalities, and the methodology of history from below. Friedrich Engels' most important historical contribution was \"Der deutsche Bauernkrieg\" (\"The German Peasants' War\"), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. \"The German Peasants' War\" indicate the Marxist interest in history from below and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise \"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844\" (1870s) was salient in creating the socialist impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon\", \"The Communist Manifesto\", \"The German Ideology\", and those chapters of \"Das Kapital\" dealing with the historical emergence of capitalists and proletarians from pre-industrial English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the Soviet Union, as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the \"Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik)\", published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under Joseph Stalin. A circle of historians inside the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably Christopher Hill and E. P. Thompson) left the CPGB after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's \"The Making of the English Working Class\" is one of the works commonly associated with this group. Eric Hobsbawm's \"Bandits\" is another example of this group's work. C. L. R. James was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work \"The Black Jacobins\" (1938), he was an anti-Stalinist Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and D. D. Kosambi are considered the founding fathers of Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are R. S. Sharma, Irfan Habib, Romila Thapar, D. N. Jha and K. N. Panikkar, most of whom are now over 75 years old.\n\nMarxist literary criticism is a loose term describing literary criticism based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include Mikhail Bakhtin, Walter Benjamin, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson.\n\nMarxist aesthetics is a theory of aesthetics based on, or derived from, the theories of Karl Marx. It involves a dialectical and materialist, or dialectical materialist, approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Lifshitz, William Morris, Theodor W. Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Georg Lukács, Ernst Fischer, Louis Althusser, Jacques Rancière, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Raymond Williams.\n\nAccording to a 2007 survey of American professors by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.\n\nKarl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of alienation and exploitation of the working class, the capitalist mode of production and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848): \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\".\n\nFriedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German political philosopher who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as \"Die heilige Familie\" (\"The Holy Family\"). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater freedom of expression than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.\n\nIn 1847, they began writing \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848), based on Engels' \"The Principles of Communism\". Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to Cologne, where they published the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\", a politically radical newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister Lord John Russell refused.\n\nAfter Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his \"Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State\" (1884) – analysing monogamous marriage as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made intellectually significant contributions to feminist theory and Marxist feminism.\n\nWith the October Revolution in 1917 the Bolsheviks took power from the Russian Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks established the first socialist state based on the ideas of Soviet Democracy and Leninism. Their newly formed federal state promised to end Russian involvement in World War I and establish a revolutionary worker's state. Following the October Revolution the Soviet government was involved in a struggle with the White Movement and several independence movements in the Russian Civil War. This period is marked by the establishment of many socialist policies and the development of new socialist ideas mainly in the form of Marxism-Leninism. In 1919 the nascent Soviet Government established the Communist Academy and the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute for doctrinal Marxist study as well as to publish official ideological and research documents for the CPSU. With Lenin's death in 1924 there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the form of the Right Opposition and Left Opposition respectively. These struggles were based on both sides different interpretations of Marxist and Leninist theory based on the situation of the Soviet Union at the time.\n\nAt the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War and more widely World War II the Chinese Communist Revolution took place within the context of the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Communist Party, which was founded in 1921, was in conflict with the Kuomintang over the future of the country. Throughout the Civil War Mao Zedong developed a theory of Marxism for the Chinese historical context. Mao found a large base of support in the peasantry as opposed to the Russian Revolution which found its primary support in the urban centers of the Russian Empire. Some major ideas contributed by Mao were the ideas of New Democracy, Mass line, and People's War. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was declared in 1949. The new socialist state was to be founded on the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.\n\nFrom Stalin's death until the late 1960s there was increasing conflict between the PRC and the Soviet Union. De-Stalinization, which first began under Nikita Khrushchev, and the policy of detente were seen as Revisionism (Marxism) and insufficiently Marxist. This ideological confrontation spilled into a wider global crisis centered around which nation was to lead the international socialist movement.\n\nFollowing Mao's death and the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping, Maoism and official Marxism in China was reworked. This new model was to be a newer dynamic form of Marxism-Leninism and Maoism in the PRC. Commonly referred to as Socialism with Chinese Characteristics this new path was centered around Deng's Four Cardinal Principles which sought to uphold the central role of the Chinese Communist Party and uphold the principle that the PRC was in the Primary stage of socialism and that it was still working to build a communist society based on Marxist principles.\n\nIn 1959, the Cuban Revolution led to the victory of Fidel Castro and his July 26 Movement. Although the revolution was not explicitly socialist, upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the Leninist model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union. One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in Congo-Kinshasa and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the Maoist government undertook the Cultural Revolution from 1966 through to 1976 to purge Chinese society of capitalist elements and achieve socialism. However, upon Mao Zedong's death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of Deng Xiaoping (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a Marxist–Leninist ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the New Right and neoliberal capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher—led the west to take a more aggressive stand towards the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist Mikhael Gorbachev became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards social democracy. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular ethnic nationalism in the Soviet Union, led to the state's dissolution in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by Prachanda was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.\n\nThe early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the \"pink tide\". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of Hugo Chávez, this trend also saw the election of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.\n\nFor Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala in their 2011 book \"Hermeneutic Communism\", \"this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the Bolivarian missions. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply\".\n\nChinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping has announced a deepening commitment of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the CPC and embrace its revolutionary past.\n\nCriticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.\n\nSome Marxists have criticised the academic institutionalisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean Trotskyist Alex Callinicos, himself a professional academic, stated: \"Its practitioners remind one of Narcissus, who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection ... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars\".\n\nAdditionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics. Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or social theory. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as Max Weber—the Frankfurt School is one example.\n\nPhilosopher and historian of ideas Leszek Kołakowski pointed out that \"Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles\". Specifically, he considers \"the laws of dialectics\" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are \"truisms with no specific Marxist content\", others \"philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means\" and some just \"nonsense\". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.\n\nOkishio's theorem shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.\n\nThe allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s. Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.\n\nMarx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.\n\nIn his books \"The Poverty of Historicism\" and \"Conjectures and Refutations\", philosopher of science Karl Popper, criticized the explanatory power and validity of historical materialism. Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided falsification by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudoscientific dogma.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's \"scientific\" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.\n\nAfter Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Orthodox Marxists became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even revisionist Marxism.\n\nAnarchism has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a transitory state phase, claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist Mikhail Bakunin criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent. The phrases \"barracks socialism\" or \"barracks communism\" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of conscripts in a barracks. Noam Chomsky is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism \"Marxism in practice\", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the council communism of Rosa Luxemburg and Anton Pannekoek. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see political positions of Noam Chomsky).\n\nLibertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism, emerged in opposition to Marxism–Leninism and its derivatives such as Stalinism and Maoism. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of reformist positions, such as those held by social democrats. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the \"Grundrisse\" and \"The Civil War in France\", emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation. Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism.\n\nOther critiques come from an economic standpoint. Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev writing in 1898, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz writing in 1906–1907 and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's value theory and law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.\n\nBoth Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of Austrian economists in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications. During the marginal revolution, subjective value theory was rediscovered by Carl Menger, a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and praxeological methodology previously used by classical economists including Richard Cantillon, Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say and Frédéric Bastiat led Menger to criticise historicist methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist Eugen Böhm von Bawerk used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with Gottfried Haberler arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it. Third-generation Austrian Ludwig von Mises rekindled debate about the economic calculation problem by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that \"rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth\".\n\nDaron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904062", "title": "Aiguillette", "text": "Aiguillette\n\nAn aiguillette (, from \"aiguille\", \"needle\"), also spelled ', ' or , is a cord with metal tips or lace tags, or the decorative tip itself.\n\nFunctional or purely decorative fasteners of silk cord with metal tips popular in the 16th and early 17th centuries, sometimes of gold set with gemstones or enameled, are generally called \"aiglets\", \"aglets\" or \"points\".\n\nIn modern usage, an \"aiguillette\" is an ornamental braided cord with decorative metal tips worn on uniforms or as part of other costumes such as academic dress, where it will denote an honour. This usage of \"aiguillette\" derives from lacing used to fasten plate armor together. As such, a knot or loop arrangement was used which sometimes hung from the shoulder.\n\nThese aiguillettes should not be confused with lanyards, which are cords also worn from the shoulder (or around the neck), but do not have the pointed aiguillette tips and are usually of fibre rather than gold or silver wire, and often not braided.\n\nThe modern aglet or shoelace tip and the decorative tips on bolo ties are types of aiguillettes.\n\nPortraits of the 16th and 17th centuries show that aiglets or metal tips could be functional or purely decorative, though many were used to \"close\" seams and slashes that are not always apparent on dark garments in portraits. They were made in matched sets, might be of silver, silver-gilt, or gold, and were worn in masses.\n\nA 1547 inventory of Henry VIII of England's wardrobe includes one coat with 12 pairs of aiglets, and 11 gowns with a total of 367 pairs. The \"Day Book of the Wardrobe of Robes\" of Elizabeth I records items received into storage, including details of buttons and aiglets lost from the Queen's clothing. This entry suggests the huge numbers of matching aiglets fashionable forty years later:\n\nLost the 2 of February ... [1582] 1 bunsh of small gold tagges or aglettes from a gowne of black satten at Sittingbourne parcell [part] of uppon the same gowne 193 bunshes\n\nElizabeth's aiglets were variously enameled with white, red, black, blue, and purple details or set with diamonds, garnets, rubies, and those of Anne of Denmark in the early years of the 17th century were larger, shaped in triangles and pyramids. One set of 24 were made three-sided, with \"27 diamonds in the sides and one in the top\", for a total of 642 diamonds in the set. \n\nThe modern aiguillette derives from the laces used to secure plates of armor together—the breast- and back-plates would be attached on one side with short loops of cord acting as a hinge, and on the other by a longer and more ornate tied one, to support the arm defences. The ensuing knots would hang down the shoulder. (As with combat boots, the longer the lace, the less the need to undo the entire lace.) As armour became more ornamental and less practical, so too did the ties. This would also explain the aiguillettes of varying levels of complexity in the uniforms of the Household Cavalry (see picture above), as opposed to other \"unarmored\" troops.\n\nA version that says that aiguillettes originated in aides-de-camp and adjutants wearing a pencil at the end of a cord hanging from the shoulder has no historical base.\n\nAiguillettes are worn on the right shoulder by armed forces officers serving in specific positions, such as aide-de-camp to the President, the Minister of Defense, each service's chief of staff and unit commanding officers, and by military attachés to Argentinian embassies abroad. The color of the aiguillette may be golden, silver or tan, depending the nature of the assignment.\n\nOlive green aiguillettes are worn with the combat uniform in very special circumstances, such as ceremonies and inspections. Otherwise, aiguillettes are not worn with the combat uniform. A special red aiguillette is worn by the adjutants to the commanding officers of the Horse Grenadiers Regiment (the presidential guard) and the Military Academy. Also, a red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by the senior NCO of each Army unit. A thinner, yellow aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by NCOs who have completed the instructor course.\n\nIn the Navy, adjutants to very senior officers wear golden aiguillettes on the left shoulder.\n\nAiguillettes distinguish officers of Flag, General and Air rank in specific command appointments, military attachés and aides-de-camp. Most senior officers and aides-de-camp to the Governor-General or state governors wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder, whilst military attachés and staff aides-de-camp wear the aiguillette on the left. Royal aiguillettes are of plain gold, naval aiguillettes are of blue and gold, army aiguillettes are of red and gold, air force aiguillettes of light blue and gold.\n\nThe Governor-General of Australia, as the Commander in Chief of the Australian Defence Force, is entitled to wear a uniform on which an aiguillette made of platinum is worn.\n\nAiguillettes with shoulder boards are worn by military aides-de-camp to the Governor General. The aiguillette is gold with brass tags and worn on the right shoulder. Aides-de-camp to the provincial lieutenant governors wear the same gold-pattern aiguillette on the right shoulder, but do not wear shoulder boards. Aiguillettes are worn on the left shoulder by aides-de-camp to generals, flag officers and diplomats. Aides-de-camp assigned to the Sovereign or officers holding a royal appointment wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder. Obsolete-style gold-braid aiguillettes mixed with army crimson, navy blue, or air force blue may also still be worn by aides-de-camp to lieutenant governors, flag and general officers and diplomats who still have them.\n\nThe Danish military uses aiguillettes for a number of different positions.\n\nThe aiguillettes are worn only with the dress uniform. There are several types of aiguillettes in the French military:\n\nAiguillettes should not be confused with \"fourragères\", which can be worn in the same way on the left shoulder in parade dress.\n\nIn Ghana, aiguillettes form part of the ceremonial uniforms of commissioned officers in the army and other security services including the police, prisons service, fire service, and customs and immigration. Senior police officers wear white aiguillettes with dark-blue uniforms, prison officers also wear yellow aiguillettes over the official ceremonial number one uniform while customs and immigration officials wear red aiguillettes with olive-green outfits. When worn, the aiguillettes denote on-duty status.\n\nAiguillettes are worn by the aides-de-camp to the President and Taoiseach. The President's ADC wears it on the right shoulder, the Taoiseach's ADC on the left.\nCivil Defence (Cosaint Sibhialta) personnel wear a white aiguillette on their dress uniform.\n\nGold aiguillettes are also worn by officers in the Defence Forces with their mess dress uniform. They are worn on the left hand shoulder.\n\nIn the IDF, soldiers who wear an aiguillette are mostly instructors.\nList of aiguillette's colors and roles in the IDF:\n\nIn the Israeli Police, policemen mainly wear a black aiguillette, and Israeli Border Police policemen wear a dark green aiguillette.\n\nAiguillettes are worn by honor guard personnel. A single silver aiguillette is worn on enlisted cut uniforms of minor detachments. A single gold aiguillette is worn on officer cut uniforms of minor detachments. A double gold aiguillette is worn on officer cut uniforms of major detachments. All personnel of major detachments wear officer cut uniforms. Demobilized soldiers also often decorate their uniforms with makeshift aiguillettes.\n\nAiguillettes are worn on the right shoulder by officers of certain appointments only. They include the: \n\nAiguillettes are also worn on the left shoulder by musicians of the Singapore Armed Forces Band and the Singapore Police Force Band. \n\nMusicians of the Singapore Armed Forces Band wears a red and gold aiguillette while Director of Musics of the Singapore Armed Forces Band wear a full gold aiguillette. \n\nStudent musicians from both the National Cadet Corps Command Band and National Police Cadet Corps Band similarly wear aiguillettes mirroring the respective parent bodies.\n\nIn Singapore, ADCs who are officers of the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Civil Defence Force wear gold aiguillettes and police officers wear silver aiguillettes. Singapore Armed Forces ADCs wear a gold braid lanyard in lieu of an aiguillette when in No.3 and No.5(T). \n\nAdditionally the newly commissioned ADC badges are worn across all five services' no.4 uniform.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, full aiguillettes are worn by members of the personal staff of the President of Sri Lanka and General officers, flag officers and air officers, while half aiguillettes are worn by the Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels in ceremonial uniforms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Sri Lanka Police, the Inspector General of Police, wear gold aiguillettes on the right shoulder, while Senior gazetted police officers wear black aiguillettes on the left shoulder in both formal and ceremonial dress.\n\nThe Swedish Defense Forces uses three types of aiguillettes. All aiguillettes come in gold or silver braid depending on the regiment of the wearer, Royal Guard regiments use silver due to historical reasons, all others gold.\n\n\nIn Sweden there is a distinction between the aiguillettes mentioned above, and other cords used on uniforms in the Royal Swedish Navy and the Swedish Air Force.\n\nThere are four types of aiguillette worn by the British Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by military aides to the President and the Vice President. It is worn on the left shoulder by military assistants to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, aides to the Service Secretaries (Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy & Secretary of the Air Force), aide to the NOAA Administrator, military attachés, General Staff Corps officers, and aides to flag officers. The cord colors are gold for the Army and silver for the Air Force, gold and blue for the Coast Guard, Navy and NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, with one braid \"per star\" of the Flag Officer (one for RDML, two for RADM, three for VADM and four for ADM), and gold and red for the Marines, with the number of braids corresponding to the rank of the General Officer similar to the Navy use. The gold cord aiguillette is worn by the directors of the United States Marine Band, while the enlisted personnel wear aiguillettes of white cord.\n\nA red aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by United States Navy Recruit Division commanders, whereas a blue aiguillette is worn by Recruit Division commanders in training. Recruit Division commanders wearing these are referred colloquially as \"red ropes\" and \"blue ropes\" respectively. The U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard in Washington, D.C. wears a blue aiguillette on summer white uniforms and a white one on winter blue uniforms. From 1983 until the issue of the campaign hat, Women Marine Drill Instructors wore a red aiguillette similar to the Navy.\n\nA blue aiguillette is worn on the left shoulder by military training leaders at technical training bases. Student airmen leaders at technical training bases (sometimes called \"ropes\" in reference to the aiguillette) also wear aiguillettes, with green representing the lowest level of student leadership, yellow representing the intermediate level of student leadership, and red representing the highest level of student leadership. Students wearing a white rope are commonly referred to as chapel guides, and are charged with providing social or moral support to their fellow airmen. Airmen who wear the black rope are experts in drill, choir, or ceremonies, and pride themselves on appearance and uniform wear. Airmen who wear a blue and white rope are members of the drum & bugle corps for their base. In the United States Air Force, honor guard members wear a silver aiguillette on the left shoulder.\n\nThe aiguillette should not be confused with the fourragère, which is worn by soldiers and Marines who are assigned to units that were awarded certain decorations by the French and Belgian governments for valorous conduct in the First and Second World Wars.\n\nNor should it be confused with the Schützenschnur, a multi-weapon marksmanship decoration awarded by Germany to qualifying soldiers of NATO countries serving in Germany.\n\nA similar, albeit thicker, device, the Infantry Blue Cord, is worn on the right shoulder by all enlisted soldiers and officers in the United States Army whose primary military occupational speciality is infantry.\n\nMany military units wear dress lanyards.\n\n"}

Her mother's ancestors, some of whom helped found Windsor, Connecticut, in 1636, included Roger Wolcott, a colonial governor and judge, and Alexander Wolcott, leader of Connecticut's Republican party. Well educated, Juliette was tutored in Latin and other languages by her mother and young uncle, Alexander Wolcott, and briefly attended a boarding school in New Haven, Connecticut, and Emma Willard's school in Troy, New York.\n\nWolcott, who had moved to Chicago in 1810, probably introduced Juliette to John H. Kinzie, son of fur trader John Kinzie. They married in 1830 and moved to Detroit and then Fort Winnebago, a new trading post at the crucial portage between the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. Her husband was an Indian sub-agent to the Ho-Chunk nation (Winnebago people), assigned to this area that connected the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds.\n\nAfter the treaty ending the Sauk War of 1832 forced the Winnebago to move west of the Mississippi River, the Kinzies left the area that would later become Wisconsin and in July 1833 moved to Chicago in the relatively new state of Illinois to join Kinzie's widowed mother and siblings. The Kinzie family was involved in Chicago's civic and social development throughout the 19th century. Active in the Episcopal church, Juliette Kinzie helped found St. James Church, now the oldest Episcopal congregation in the city, and since 1955 the cathedral for the Diocese of Chicago. The Kinzies also helped found St. Luke's Hospital and the Chicago Historical Society (now the Chicago History Museum).\n\nKinzie died while vacationing in Amagansett, New York, Long Island, in 1870, after a druggist accidentally substituted morphine for the quinine she ordered.\n\nMembers of the Kinzie family, particularly her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, told Juliette about the Battle of Fort Dearborn at Chicago. Being Canadians, they were not attacked (it was during the War of 1812), and evacuated to Detroit. In 1844 Kinzie published \"Narrative of the Massacre at Chicago, August 15, 1812, and of Some Preceding Events\", anonymously, but acknowledged authorship soon after publication.\n\nHer second book \"Wau-Bun: The \"Early Day\" in the North West\", extended her first book. It recounted her experiences at Fort Winnebago in the early 1830s, as well as those of her mother-in-law and other relatives during the Black Hawk War. The title reflects the local word for daybreak. Kinzie described her journeys back and forth to the early settlement of Chicago, and complex cultural encounters with a diverse frontier society. Unusual for its day, the book also described sympathetically and in detail the lives of Native Americans, who were being displaced by her extended family and other white settlers. An appendix included excerpts from the journals of relative Thomas Forsyth, who blamed the United States (rather than the Sauk) for starting the war. Published by Derby and Jackson in 1856, it was reprinted 19 times by the end of that century, and four more times in the 20th century. At least one 20th century historian found it unduly romantic, and criticized it for exaggerating the importance of her relatives, particularly her father-in-law.\n\nIn 1869 her novel \"Walter Ogilby\" was published. Her \"Narrative...\" was reworked and released as \"Mark Logan, the Bourgeois\" in 1871 following her death.\n\nJuliette and John Kinzie had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood. John Kinzie served as U.S. Army paymaster for Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois troops in the Civil War and died of a heart attack on his way to a vacation shortly after President Lincoln's assassination. One son died fighting for the Union in the Civil War, two others were taken prisoner by Confederate forces but survived.\n\nTheir daughter Eleanor (Nellie) married William Washington Gordon II, son of William Washington Gordon of Savannah, Georgia. In 1860, they named their second child after grandmother Juliette, and Juliette Gordon Low later founded Girl Scouting in America in 1912. Nellie also followed her mother's example by expressing outrage over the treatment of Native American heritage sites and monuments, and caused the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Wisconsin to erect a new monument to Tomochichi (who had donated the land on which Savannah began) after the Central of Georgia Railway erected a monument to her father-in-law displacing a previous Tomochichi monument.\n\nThe house in which the Kinzie family lived in what is now Portage, Wisconsin, as discussed in \"Wau-bun\", is now known as the Old Indian Agency House. The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Wisconsin, who own the house, restored and refurbished it in 1932 as their centennial project. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.\n\n\n"}

The name \"Cochleanthes\" refers to the shape of the flower (in Greek, \"cochlos\" means \"shell\" and \"anthos\" means \"flower\").\n\nThis genus as a rule lacks pseudobulbs and consequently produces tufted fan-like growths of fairly erect narrow leaves, and conforms to the sympodial method of growth. Plants of this genus produce single-flowered inflorescences, with the flowers often being quite large for the size of the plant, and occurring at any time of the year, though slightly more concentrated during summer in cultivation. All members of this genus have their flowers dominated by the large labellum (lip) which often has longitudinal markings upon it which serve as a nectar guide for pollinating insects. The flowers have four pollinia.\n\n\"Cochleanthes\" is best kept under intermediate conditions with fairly high humidity, and should never be allowed to dry out. Plants are epiphytes and grow at elevations of up to 1500 metres in cloud forests.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904092", "title": "Ryō", "text": "Ryō\n\nA was a gold currency unit in pre-Meiji Japan Shakkanhō system. It was eventually replaced with a system based on the \"yen\".\n\nThe \"ryō\" was originally a unit of weight from China, the \"tael.\" It came into use in Japan during the Kamakura period. By the Azuchi–Momoyama period it had become nearly uniform throughout Japan, about 4.4 \"monme\" as a unit of weight (about the same as 16.5 grams).\n\nDuring the Sengoku period, various local \"daimyō\" began to mint their own money. One of the best known and most prestigious of these private coins was the \"koshukin\" issued by the warlord Takeda Shingen, who had substantial gold deposits within his territories. The value of the koshukin was based on its weight, with one \"koshukin\" equal to one ryō of gold, and thus stamped with its weight (about 15 grams). During the Tenshō period (1573–1592), one ryō was equal to four \"koku\" of rice, or 1000 brass coins.\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate attempted to create a central currency, based on gold, silver and copper units all exchangeable at fixed rates. Oblong gold coins, called \"koban\", were minted with one \"koban\" containing about one \"ryō\" of gold, so that \"koban\" carried a face value of one \"ryō\". The official rate was set in 1609 at one \"ryō\" equal to 50 \"monme\" (approx 187 grams) of silver, or 4000 brass coins. However, in reality the relative values between gold, silver and brass currencies fluctuated on an almost daily basis throughout the Edo period.\n\nIn 1695 the government decided to increase the amount of metal money in circulation by debasement. As a result, the \"ryō\" as a unit of weight of gold and the \"ryō\" as the face value of the \"koban\" were no longer synonymous. The Keichō \"koban\" issued after the monetary reform of May 1601 offered approximately 17.9 grams gold with fineness of 84–87%. The Genroku \"koban\" issued in 1695 still weighed around 17.9 grams; however its gold content was reduced to 57%. The Hōei \"koban\" of 1706 returned to the original fineness; however, the size was much reduced and it had little more than half the metal value of the Keichō \"koban\". In 1700 the official exchange rate was adjusted to 1 ryō equal to 60 \"monme\" silver (225 grams) or 4000 brass coins. Tokugawa Yoshimune further conducted a reform to stimulate the economy and raise prices in 1736, again lowering the gold content of the \"koban\".\n\nOne \"ryō\" was also considered equivalent to 1 \"koku\" of rice, or the amount of rice needed to feed one person for one year, although this was a less exact standard, which fluctuated depending on the abundance of the rice crop in any particular year.\n\nOn June 27, 1871, with the introduction of currency reforms after the Meiji Restoration, the \"ryō\" was abolished, and replaced one-for-one with the Yen.\n\nThese fluctuations in the gold content of the koban over time, as well as differences in the cost of living between various points in the Edo period and in modern times make any attempt to relate the value of one ryō in terms of modern currency very difficult. Japanese middle school textbooks often state that one ryō was approximately equivalent to 100,000 Yen at the start of the Edo period, and around 3000–4000 yen at the end of the Edo period. On the other hand, the Currency Museum of the Bank of Japan states that one ryō had a nominal value equivalent 300,000–400,000 yen, but was worth only 120,000–130,000 yen in practice, or 40,000 yen in terms of rice.\n\n\n"}

In 1993, she became the first (and so far only) female jockey to win a Triple Crown race when she captured the Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair. In 2000, she became the first woman inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, and in 2003 became the first female jockey to win a Breeders' Cup race. She has also been honored by induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame and Cowgirl Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter spending her childhood as an accomplished show horse rider at competitions in western Michigan, Krone was inspired by the career of Steve Cauthen to become a professional Thoroughbred jockey. She made her debut as a jockey on Jan. 30, 1981, at Tampa Bay Downs in Florida, on a horse named Tiny Star. She won her first race on Feb. 12, 1981, also at Tampa Bay Downs, aboard Lord Farkle. Within a few years, her success made her a well-known racing personality. Krone was the only woman to win riding championships at Belmont Park, Gulfstream Park, Monmouth Park, The Meadowlands and Atlantic City Race Course. She would go on to make appearances on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", \"The Tonight Show\" with Jay Leno, and appear on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" for the issue of May 22, 1989, one of only eight jockeys so recognized (the others are Willie Shoemaker, Bill Hartack, Eddie Arcaro, Johnny Longden, John Sellers, Robyn Smith and Steve Cauthen). In 1993 she received an ESPY Award as Female Athlete of the Year.\n\nKrone retired for the first time on April 18, 1999, with a three-winner day at Lone Star Park, near Dallas. She embarked upon a broadcasting career in horse racing. From 1999–2000 she worked as an analyst for TVG Network, then worked as a paddock analyst for Hollywood Park from 1999–2002. She came out of retirement at Santa Anita Park in November 2002. After a good start to the 2003 season, she fractured two bones in her lower back and spent the next four months recovering. She returned to lead the 2003 Del Mar jockeys in purse earnings, then went on to become the first woman jockey to win a Breeders' Cup race when she rode Halfbridled to victory in the 2003 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Santa Anita. On December 12, 2003, just weeks after her Breeders' Cup win, she broke several ribs and suffered severe muscle tears in a fall at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Though not fully recovered from her injuries, Krone attempted to come back on February 14, 2004, at Santa Anita Park but failed to win in three races. She did not ride again; on July 8 of that year, she made a statement in which she did not officially retire, but strongly hinted that she would never race again.\n\nBecause of her success in the face of severe injuries sustained while racing, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women's Sports Foundation. Krone also had been inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, and is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2013 she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y. In 2018 a bronze statue of her was given to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2001 Krone married Jay Hovdey, executive columnist for the \"Daily Racing Form\". She gave birth to their daughter Lorelei Judith Krone in 2005. (Hovdey also has a son, Ed, from his previous marriage.) Her mother, Judi Krone, was an accomplished equestrian who died a few days before Christmas of 1999.\n\nSince her second retirement from racing, Krone has focused on parenting and worked as a racing broadcaster, motivational speaker, and an instructor of natural horsemanship.

{"id": "1904097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904097", "title": "The Exterminator", "text": "The Exterminator\n\nThe Exterminator is a 1980 American vigilante neo noir action film written and directed by James Glickenhaus. It stars Robert Ginty as the Vietnam War veteran John Eastland, also known as \"The Exterminator\". When a group of thugs paralyze his friend, Eastland becomes a vigilante; embarking on a mission to cleanse New York of organized crime. The film also stars Samantha Eggar, Christopher George and Steve James. It has gained a cult following since its release.\n\nDuring a firefight in Vietnam, U.S. soldiers John Eastland and his best friend, Michael Jefferson, are captured by the Viet Cong. They are tied to wooden stakes with several other men, and tortured for information. When Eastland refuses to answer, the VC commander decapitates the soldier beside him with a machete. Jefferson escapes moments later, kills the remaining VC soldiers, and unties Eastland. Eastland then kills the VC commander.\n\nThe film then shifts to New York, where Eastland and Jefferson work in a warehouse. One day, Eastland catches a group of thugs, called the Ghetto Ghouls, trying to steal beer. He is attacked, but Jefferson comes to his aid. They defeat them, but the gang return to cripple Jefferson, gouging his spine with a meat hook. Eastland, after this incident, captures and interrogates one of the gang members with a flamethrower. He then attacks the gang's base of operations with his rifle, shooting one gang member and leaving two others tied up in a basement (also shooting one of them afterwards), which is full of hungry rats.\nEastland's vigilante justice doesn't end there. The warehouse where he works has been forced into paying protection money. Gino Pontivini, the mob boss behind the scheme, has even taxed the workers paychecks. Eastland kidnaps Pontivini, and chains him above an industrial meat grinder. Eastland then demands information to get to Pontivini's safe, which Pontivini reluctantly gives. Eastland barely survives an attack by Pontivini's Dobermann, so upon returning, he lowers Pontivini into the grinder for lying about the dog. Jefferson and his family are given Pontivini's money; to help pay their bills.\n\nDetective James Dalton begins investigating the attacks, while the press dub Eastland the \"Exterminator\". Meanwhile, Eastland kills the ring leader of a child prostitution ring, as well as a state senator from New Jersey who sexually abuses children. He also kills three more members of the Ghetto Ghouls (one of which being the gang member he'd interrogated earlier), after witnessing them rob an elderly woman.\n\nMeanwhile, the CIA has heard of the Exterminator and reaches an odd conclusion. Based on the current administration's promise to cut down crime rates, they believe the Exterminator is either an opposition party's stunt, or a foreign power's ruse to humiliate the current administration; by exposing their inability to handle the city's crime problem. They monitor Dalton's investigation of the Exterminator. Dalton, working from a bootprint found at Pontivini's home, discovers the Exterminator wears hunting boots manufactured by a mail order firm in Maine. Asking them for a list of clients in New York, and following the hunch that the Exterminator may be a Vietnam War veteran; since he killed the Ghetto Ghouls with an M16 rifle, Dalton has narrowed his suspects accordingly.\n\nEastland visits Jefferson in the hospital, and because he will never be able to walk again, Jefferson asks Eastland to kill him. Eastland does, but coincidentally, Dalton is visiting the hospital at the same time. When he learns about Jefferson's death, Dalton surmises that one of Jefferson's friends was the Exterminator, and learns that one of his suspects, Eastland, was Jefferson's closest friend.\n\nEastland is aware that Dalton is staking out his apartment, so he arranges a private meeting with him, where he hopes to explain why he became a vigilante. However, the CIA are aware of the rendezvous after bugging Eastland's phone. They ambush him at his meeting with Dalton, which results in Dalton being killed while helping Eastland escape.\n\nIn some releases Eastland survived the CIA ambush, whereas in others he is killed alongside Dalton.\n\n\nSamuel L. Jackson appears in an uncredited role as a movie extra.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports a rating of 36% based on 11 reviews, indicating mostly negative reviews.\n\nAt an advance screening; six months before the film's release, Roger Ebert, of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", criticized \"The Exterminator\" for being a \"sick example of the almost unbelievable descent\" that American movies had taken \"into gruesome savagery\". He called the film a \"direct rip-off\" of \"Death Wish\" (1974). After researching the \"Death Wish\" franchise, author Paul Talbot concluded that \"Death Wish\" \"inspired\" a number of \"sadistic vigilante-themed movies\"; \"The Exterminator\" being one of them. \"The New York Times\", on the other hand, praised the acting, but felt the film was let down by the \"screenplay and direction\" of \"beginner\" James Glickenhaus; and by \"lighting, camera work and sound that would rate an 'F' at film school\".\n\nContemporary critics have been more appreciative. Eoin Friel, of the Action Elite, awarded three and a half stars out of five. Even though he found the opening scene quite \"shocking\", the acting a bit \"ropey\", and the effects \"dated\", he admitted the film \"grabs you from the start\". Den of Geek's Phil Beresford gave a mixed review. He stated that while Ginty is \"not the greatest or most charismatic\" of actors, \"his essential ordinariness really works within the confines\" of the film.\n\nDue to its graphic violence, \"The Exterminator\" has been a controversial subject since its release. Dr. Sharon Packer and Jody Pennington spoke of this controversy and the film's \"extreme justice\" in their book \"A History of Evil in Popular Culture.\" They claimed the violence was a contributing factor to the film's \"success,\" as the \"audience loved it.\"\n\nA sequel, \"Exterminator 2\", was released in 1984. Ginty and producer Mark Buntzman returned, with Buntzman serving as director as well. The sequel was less successful. It grossed $3.7 million at the domestic box office, while its predecessor grossed $5 million in the same region.\n\n\n"}

Born in Rome, Bava began working as an assistant director for his director father Mario Bava. Lamberto co-directed the 1979 television film \"La Venere d'Ille\" with his father and in 1980 directed his first solo feature film \"Macabre\".\n\nBava continued working in the 1980s and collaborated with Dario Argento on films such as \"Demons\". After 1990, Bava's work was predominantly involved with television, such as his \"Fantaghirò\" series.\n\nLamberto Bava was born in Rome, Italy on 3 April 1944. Lamberto's father Mario Bava was a film director known primarily as a director of horror films. Lamberto's film career began in the mid-1960s working as an assistant director on his father's film \"Planet of the Vampires\". Lamberto would later collaborate with his father on several of his projects, including \"\" (1966), \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" (1971) and \"Shock\" (1977) (On \"Shock\", Lamberto Bava was credited as a screenwriter as well as an assistant director.) Besides the work he did with his father, Lamberto also contributed to making films with Italian director Ruggero Deodato, such as \"Ultimo mondo cannibale\" (1977) and \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (1979). In 1978, Lamberto and Mario directed an episode of the Italian television series \"I giochi del diavolo (Storie fantastiche dell'Ottocento)\" (), a television series with six stories based on 19th century fantastic literature. Their episode was based on \"La Venere d'Ille\" by Prosper Mérimée and broadcast on RAI 1 on March 27, 1981.\n\nA meeting with director Pupi Avati led to Bava directing his own feature film \"Macabre\" in 1980 which was co-written with Pupi and Antonio Avati. The film stars Bernice Stegers as Jane, a woman who has an affair with a man (Stanko Molnar), who dies. After his death, Jane keeps his severed head in her refrigerator and performs erotic acts with it. According to Lamberto Bava, after seeing \"Macabre\", Mario told him \"Now I can die in peace\". Mario actually died later in 1980.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Macabre\", Lamberto Bava worked in advertising and continued to write stories for potential future film projects. He was approached by director Dario Argento to assist him with his \"giallo\" film \"Tenebre\" (1982), wherein Bava is credited as an assistant director. In 1983, Lamberto Bava directed his second feature film as a director, the \"giallo\" film \"A Blade in the Dark\". \"A Blade in the Dark\" was originally developed as a television film shot in four 25-minute segments on a very low budget. The film stars Andrea Occhipinti as the music composer Bruno, a man who becomes involved in a series of murders while staying at a secluded villa.\n\nBava's next two film projects were in different genres than his previous \"giallo\" and horror film output. Bava was given a script for \"Blastfighter\", a film originally written as a remake of the Australian film \"Mad Max\" with the intention of giving it to director Lucio Fulci. \"Blastfighter\" starred Michael Sopkiw as Tiger, a detective who had been released from prison for shooting the man who killed his wife. Tiger moves into the woods with his daughter where he is terrorized by a group of thugs. Lamberto's next film, \"Monster Shark\", was a science fiction film about a mutated shark that goes on a killing spree with two marine biologists attempting to track down the creature to stop it.\n\nIn 1985, Lamberto Bava reteamed with Dario Argento on the film \"Demons\". Argento co-wrote and produced Bava's film about a theater showing invitation-only screenings of a horror film. In the theater's lobby, a young woman is scratched by a display in the lobby and transforms into a hideous creature who then attacks other audience members, spreading her demonic infection. The film was followed by the sequel \"Demons 2\" in 1986 which had many of the same cast and crew members from \"Demons\". \"Demons 2\" features a television program which causes an outbreak of zombies in an apartment complex. Bava also made the television film \"Midnight Killer\" the same year. The film is about a series of murders which are similar to one that was committed 15 years prior, despite the fact that the murderer supposedly died in a fire. Bava makes a cameo in the film as a photographer at the beginning of the film. While working on \"Midnight Killer\", Bava began preparing his next film, \"Delirium\" (1987). \"Delerium\" stars Serena Grandi as Gioia, a model for \"Pussycat\" magazine. Gioia's co-workers end up murdered through bizarre means including pitchforks and bees and then their corpses posed in front of photos of her, which Gioia receives in the mail from the murderer.\n\nBava returned to television work making several episodes of a series of hour-long films produced by Dario Argento. Bava's episodes included \"E ...di Moda la Morte\", \"Heavy Metal\", \"Buona Fine È Migliore Principo\", \"Giubetto Rosso\", \"Il Bambino Rapito\" and \"Babbao Natale\". In July 1986, the company Reteitalia announced that they would new television films for a series titled \"Brivido giallo\" would be directed by Bava. The films were shot between 1987 and 1988 where there were initially going to be a series of five films, it ended up being four. The first was \"Graveyard Disturbance\" which was shown at the Sitges Film Festival in 1987 and \"Until Death\" which was released on home video in Germany over a year before its television debut in Italy in 1989. The other films in the series were \"The Ogre\" and \"Dinner with a Vampire\".\n\nThe \"Brivido giallo\" series was not popular with critics or audiences which led to Bava's next television films in a series titled \"Alta tensione\" which were shot between 1988 and 1989 to be only be released in 1999 on the Mediaset network. One television film made at that time for the series was only released in 2007 on the satellite channel Fantasy TV. Bava also did a remake of \"Black Sunday\" for the European television series \"Sabbath\" titled \"La maschera del demonio\" which premiered in June 1990 at Rome's Fantafestival. Bava began the 1990s with the fairy tale inspired series \"\"Fantaghirò\" series\" and its many sequels.\n\nIn 1992, Bava made the film \"Body Puzzle\", which starred Joanna Pacula, who learns that her late husband Abe had a lover named Tim Bell. When Tim learns that Abe was an organ donor, Tim begins killing people in order to rebuild him. Bava also worked in television. In 1991, Bava directed \"Fantaghiro\", a television miniseries that was influenced by films such as \"Legend\", \"Willow\" and \"Ladyhawke\". The series was aimed more at family audiences than Bava's previous work and violence is kept to a minimum. The series concluded in 1997 with eight feature-length episodes. Before finishing the series, Bava worked on other television projects, including \"Desideria\", between 1994 and 1995, and a second fantasy series titled \"Sorellina e il Principe del Sogno\" (1996). In the late 1990s, Bava made another television film entitled \"Caraibi\". Bava's more recent film work includes \"L'Impero\" (2000) and \"Ghost Son\" (2006).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1904123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904123", "title": "Gerard of Csanád", "text": "Gerard of Csanád\n\nGerard or Gerard Sagredo (; ; ; 23 April 977/1000 – 29 August 1046) was the first bishop of Csanád in the Kingdom of Hungary from around 1030 to his death. Most information about his life was preserved in his legends which contain most conventional elements of medieval biographies of saints. He was born in a Venetian noble family, associated with the Sagredos or Morosinis in sources written centuries later. After a serious illness, he was sent to the Benedictine San Giorgio Monastery at the age of five. He received excellent monastic education and also learnt grammar, music, philosophy and law.\n\nHe left Venice for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land around 1020, but a storm compelled him to break his journey near Istria. He decided to visit the Kingdom of Hungary. Maurus, bishop of Pécs, and Stephen I of Hungary convinced him not to continue his pilgrimage, emphasizing that Gerard's preachings could accelerate the conversion of the Hungarians. Gerard was made the tutor of the king's son and heir, Emeric. Before long, Gerard went to the Bakony Hills to live as a hermit near Bakonybél. Stephen I made him bishop of the newly established Diocese of Csanád (encompassing present-day Banat in Serbia, Romania and Hungary) around 1030. Benedictine monks who could speak Hungarian helped him to preach among the local inhabitants.\n\nMost information of Gerard was not preserved in impartial sources, but in his hagiographies. The \"Short Life of Saint Gerard\", which was composed around 1100, is an abridgement of an earlier biography. The earlier biography did not survive. The \"Short Life\" primarily presents Gerard as a bishop. The majority of scholars regard the \"Short Life\" the most reliable source of Gerard's life.\n\nThe \"Long Life of Saint Gerard\" is a compilation of multiple sources, including the biography that the author of the shorter legend had also utilized. The \"Long Life\" was completed in the late 13th century or in the 14th century. It was regarded as a source of absolute reliability for centuries, but this view radically changed in the 20th century. György Györffy even stated that the \"Long Life\" was a forgery. Historian Gábor Klaniczay also emphasizes that the longer legend contains obviously anachronistic elements. On the other hand, Carlile Aylmer Macartney says that the \"Long Life\" preserved the original form of Gerard's earliest (now lost) biography.\n\nGerard's own work, the \"Deliberatio supra hymnum trium puerorum\" also contain references to his life. Simon of Kéza's chronicle and the \"Illuminated Chronicle\" preserved fragments from the common source of Gerard's two \"Lives\". A 13th-century rhymed version (or chant) of Gerard's legend was also preserved, but it does not contain more information than the \"Short Life\".\n\nGerard's \"Long Life\" dedicates two chapters to his family and childhood. Conventional elements of medieval hagiographies abound in both chapters, suggesting that the author borrowed many motives from other legends, especially from the \"Life of Saint Adalbert of Prague\". Gerard was born in Venice in a noble family. The noble origin of saintly hermits was often emphasized in their legends.\n\nThe identification of Gerard's family is uncertain. An expanded version of Petrus de Natalibus's \"Catalogue of Saints\", which was published in 1516, identified Gerard as a member of the Sagredo family. Although the family was granted Venetian nobility only in the 14th century, some scholars (including Fabio Banfi) accept the Sagredos' claim to their kinship with Saint Gerard. Historian László Szegfű says that Gerard was actually a Morosini.\n\nGerard's father, who was also named Gerard, and mother, Catherine, had awaited his birth for three years. They baptised their son George because he was born on the feast of Saint George (23 April). The year of his birth is unknown, but he was born between around 977 and 1000. He was renamed in the memory of his father who died during a pilgrimage or journey (anachronistically mentioned in Gerard's \"Long Life\" as a crusade).\n\nAt the age of five, Gerard was taken seriously ill. His recovery was attributed to the prayers of the Benedictine monks of the San Giorgio Monastery in Venice. His family soon sent him to the monastery, offering him to spiritual life. Gerard took the \"religious cloth\" and was educated in the monastery. He could read and write and knew the basic elements of arithmetic. His \"Long Life\" emphasizes that Gerard strictly observed the rules of monastic life and wore coarse cloths to \"mortify his body\". He also studied the \"words of the prophets and the speeches of the Orthodox apostles\". The use of certain expressions (including \"dux verbi\", or \"leader of the Word\") suggests that Gerard read Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in Greek.\n\nAfter the founding abbot of the monastery, John Morosini, died in 1012, Gerard was appointed prior to administer the monastery until the new abbot, Guglielmo, was elected. Guglielmo sent Gerard to \"Bologna\" to study grammar, music, philosophy and law. Gerard mentioned his stay in Gaul, where he read Plato, suggesting that the original version of the \"Long Life\" or its source referred to his studies in Burgundy instead of Bologna. Gerard returned to the San Giorgo Monastery five years later. His \"Long Life\" writes that Gerard was made abbot although he had been opposed to his election. No information about his activities as abbot was preserved in the sources, implying that he actually never held that office.\n\nGerard left for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. According to his \"Long Life\", he wanted to follow the example of Saint Jerome. Modern historians say that internal strifes (armed conflicts between the Orseolos and their opponents) compelled him to leave the town around 1018 or 1021. A storm forced him to seek refuge in a Benedictine monastery on an island near Istria. In the monastery, he met one Rasina. Historian György Györffy associates Rasina with Radla, a close companion of Adalbert of Prague; László Mezey writes that Rasina was the abbot of the Saint Martin Monastery in Lošinj. Rasina persuaded Gerard to accompany him to Hungary, saying that \"nowhere else in the world could one find today a more suitable place to win souls for the Lord\". The conversion of the Hungarians had started in the 970s, but it accelerated only around 1000. The systematic organization of the Church began during the reign of the first king of Hungary, Stephen I of Hungary, who was crowned on the first day the new millennium.\n\nGerard and Rasina visited Zadar, Knin and Senj before reaching Pécs in Hungary. Gerard met Maurus, bishop of Pécs, and Anastasius, Abbot of Pécsvárad, in Pécs. The two prelates wanted to persuade Gerard to stay in Hungary, stating that \"God's will\" had brought him to the country. After Gerard gave sermons in their presence, Maurus and Anastasius stated that he was a \"master of the word\", declaring that such a cleric had never visited Hungary.\n\nMaurus and Anastasius convinced Gerard, who wanted to continue his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to meet King Stephen I in Székesfehérvár. During their meeting, the king emphasized that his realm was the most suitable place for Gerard \"to serve God\", promising that he would authorize Gerard to preach anywhere in Hungary. Stephen I even threatened Gerard that he would not allow him to continue his journey to Jerusalem, but also alluding that he would make Gerard bishop. Finally, Gerard accepted Stephen's proposal and decided to stay in Hungary. Before long, on the Feast of the Assumption (15 August), Gerard gave a sermon in honor of the \"Woman clothed with the Sun\", which was the first recorded sign of the cult of Virgin Mary in Hungary. According to Macartney, the description of Gerard's journey to Hungary and his meetings with the two prelates and the king were incorporated into the \"Long Life\" based on a nearly contemporaneous report, but they contain evidently imaginary details, such as the conversations between Gerard and Stephen I.\n\nGerard was made the tutor of Stephen's son and heir, Emeric. Gerard's role as the crown prince's tutor was only mentioned in the \"Long Life\", implying that this was only an invention by the hagiographer who wanted to create a strong connection between the three most important saints of the early Kingdom of Hungary, but the story is not surely invented. Szegfű writes that Gerard may have influenced Stephen's \"Admonitions\" to Emeric. László Mezey proposes that Gerard was only responsible for the spiritual education of Emeric.\n\nAfter Emeric's education was completed, Gerard settled in the Bakony Hills to live as a hermit near Bakonybél, at a place where the saintly Gunther of Bohemia had lived. Szegfű says that Gerard's withdrawal from the royal court was the consequence of the arrival of the family of the Doge Otto Orseolo to Hungary around 1024. During the following years, Gerard built a chapel at the foot of a hill, and wrote theological studies and homilies (which were later lost). He referred to the commentaries that he had written to the \"Epistle to the Hebrews\" and to the Prologue to the \"Gospel of John\". Gerard lived as a hermit for seven years, which suggests that he must have spent several years in the Bakony Hills even if the author of his legend only invented the symbolic number seven.\n\nA powerful chieftain, Ajtony, ruled the region near the rivers Tisza, Danube and Mureș in the early 11th century. He was baptised according to the \"Greek rite\" and settled \"Greek\" (or Eastern Orthodox) monks in his seat on the Mureș. After Ajtony began taxing the salt carried on the Mureș, Stephen I of Hungary sent the royal army against him under the command of Csanád, who had previously been Ajtony's commander. Csanád defeated and killed Ajtony whose domain was transformed into a county. Ajtony's seat was renamed for Csanád.\n\nAfter the conquest of Ajtony's territory, Stephen I summoned Gerard from his hermitage and made him bishop of the newly established Diocese of Csanád. László Mezey says that the king appointed Gerard to administer the diocese because Gerard's knowledge of the Greek language and the Eastern Orthodox theological ideas enabled him to preach in a territory where Greek priests had up to that time proselytized. The \"Annales Posonienses\" recorded that \"Gerard was consecrated bishop\" in 1030, but the reliability of this date was not accepted by all historians. The king appointed twelve monks from the Benedictine monasteries in Hungary to accompany Gerard to his see. Seven of the twelve monks who could speak Hungarian were tasked with interpreting for Gerard among Ajtony's former subjects. The Greek monks who had arrived during Ajtony's rule were transferred from Csanád to a monastery newly established at Oroszlámos (present-day Banatsko Aranđelovo in Serbia), and their former monastery was granted to the Benedictines.\n\nGerard and the Benedictine monks shared a house and he forbade them to leave it without his authorization. The monks were required to be present for the morning service and to wear monastic costume. Gerard continued to wear the habits of a hermit (cilice or goat skins) and spent days in solitude in the forests near his see. His legend also writes that he often \"took the axe\" to cut woods to \"mortify his flesh\" and to help to \"those who had to do this work\".\n\nGerard was a missionary bishop, tasked with the conversion of the pagan inhabitants of his diocese. His \"Long Life\" writes that people came to Gerard, \"noblemen and commoners, rich and poor\", asking him to baptize them \"in the name of the Holy Trinity\". They brought horses, cattle, sheep, carpets, rings and necklaces to give them to the bishop. The \"Long Life\" credits Gerard with the building of churches \"for every city\" in his diocese to serve the growing number of believers. Although the \"Long Life\" attributes the establishment of the archdeaconries of Gerard's diocese to him, most scholars regard this statement as a clear anachronism. Gerard regularly visited Stephen. During a travel from Csanád to the royal court in Székesfehérvár or Esztergom, he and one of his clerics, Walther, stayed in a manor where a slave woman was singing while making flour on a grinder. Gerard referred to the music as the \"\"symphonia Ungarorum\"\" (or \"drum of the Hungarians\"), associating the sound of the grinder with a drum roll. Being touched by her cheerfulness while making a hard work, Gerard gave the woman precious gifts.\n\nStephen I died on 15 August 1038. His nephew, the Venetian Peter Orseolo mounted the throne, but he was dethroned in 1041. Peter's successor, Samuel Aba, had many lords executed. He visited Csanád, asking Gerard to put a crown on his head during the mass on Resurrection Sunday. He refused Aba, but the bishops who accompanied the king to Csanád, performed the coronation. Gerard went to the pulpit, declaring that the \"sword of vengeance will descend\" upon Aba's head in three years, because he had gained the kingdom by deceit. The credibility of the report of the \"Long Life\" of Aba's visit in Gerard's see is subject to scholarly debates.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III, invaded Hungary and defeated Aba in the Battle of Ménfő in 1044. Peter Orseolo was restored, but his rule was unpopular, because he favored his German and Italian retaineers.\n\nGerard's martyrdom took place on 24 September 1046, during the Vata pagan uprising. His co-martyrs were Bystrik and Buldus. There are various accounts of his death. According to one, he was stoned, pierced with a lance, and his body thrown from the Blocksberg cliff into the Danube. An alternate account claims that he was placed on a two-wheel cart, hauled to the hilltop and rolled down a hill of Buda, now named Gellert Hill, then still being alive at the bottom, was beaten to death. Other unverified tales report him as being put into a spiked barrel and rolled down the hill during a mass revolt of pagans.\n\nCanonized in 1083, along with St. Stephen and St. Emeric, Gerard is currently one of the patron saints of Hungary. His feast day is 24 September.\n\n\n\n"}

The Centre's aim is to carry out lexicographic research into needs-adapted information and data access, i.e. research work into dictionary theory in general and it has built a solid, international reputation in that field.\n\nThe Centre is headed by professor Dr. Henning Bergenholtz who together with associate professor Dr. Sven Tarp, has proposed a theory that is often referred to as \"the Aarhus School\", see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp (2009) and Nielsen/Tarp (2009). The theory focuses on the functions of dictionaries, i.e. communication related functions (such as text reception, text production, text revision, text editing, and translation – which are all text-dependent) and knowledge related or cognitive functions (such as gaining knowledge in general or about a specific topic unrelated to a specific text). The theory focuses on the dictionary as a utility product, i.e. it provides a specific type of help to a specific type of user in specific types of user situations. The work at the Centre focuses on all aspects of lexicography, in particular LSP lexicography (e.g. Nielsen 1994; and Bergenholtz/Tarp 1995), learner's lexicography (e.g. Tarp 2008), language policy in dictionaries (e.g. Bergenholtz 2006), and dictionary reviewing (e.g. Nielsen 2009).\n\nIn addition to their theoretical work the staff at the Centre for Lexicography have published more than 30 printed and electronic dictionaries, often in collaboration with external partners. These dictionaries are all based on the theoretical principles developed at the Centre and cover monolingual and bilingual general dictionaries, business dictionaries, law dictionaries and accounting dictionaries.\n\n\n"}

It is the lower stream of the Brahmaputra River, which originates in Tibet as Yarlung Tsangpo, before flowing into India and then southwest into Bangladesh. The Jamuna flows south and joins the Padma River (\"Pôdda\"), near Goalundo Ghat, before meeting the Meghna River near Chandpur. It then flows into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna River.\n\nThe Brahmaputra-Jamuna is a classic example of a braided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion.\nIt is characterised by a network of interlacing channels with numerous sandbars enclosed between them. The sandbars, known in Bengali as \"chars\", do not occupy a permanent position. The river deposits them in one year, very often to be destroyed later, and redeposits them in the next rainy season. The process of bank and deposit erosion together with redeposition has been going on continuously, making it difficult to precisely demarcate the boundary between the district of Pabna on one side and the districts of Mymensingh, Tangail and Dhaka on the other. The breaking of a \"char\" or the emergence of a new one is also a cause of much violence and litigation. The confluence of the Jamuna River and Padma River is unusually unstable and has been shown to have migrated southeast by over fourteen kilometres between 1972 and 2014.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the Teesta River (or \"Tista\"), one of its largest tributaries. The Teesta earlier ran due south from Jalpaiguri in three channels, namely, the Karatoya to the east, the Punarbhaba in the west and the Atrai in the centre. The three channels possibly gave the name to the river as \"Trisrota\" \"possessed of three streams\" which has been shortened and corrupted to Teesta. Of these three, the Punarbhaba joined the Mahananda. The Atrai passing through a vast marshy area known as Chalan Beel joined the Karatoya and the united stream joined the Padma (Ganges) near Jafarganj. In the destructive floods of 1787, the Teesta river forsook its old channel and rushing south-east it joined the Brahmaputra.\n\nJames Rennell made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches — Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya, etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo. The Hoorsagar river is still in existence, being the combined outfall of the Baral, a spill channel of the Ganges, the Atrai, the Jamuna or Jamuneswari (not the main Jamuna through which the Brahmaputra now flows), and the Karatoya, but instead of falling into the Ganges, it falls into the main Jamuna, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Padma at Goalundo.\nBelow the Teesta, the Brahmaputra splits into two distributary branches. The western branch, which contains the majority of the river's flow, continues due south as the Jamuna () to merge with the lower Ganges, called the Padma River (). The eastern branch, formerly the larger but now much smaller, is called the lower or Old Brahmaputra (). It curves southeast to join the Meghna River near Dhaka. The Padma and Meghna converge near Chandpur and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. This final part of the river is called \"Meghna\".\n\nIn the past the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts. In a major magnitude earthquake on April 2, 1762, the main channel of the Brahmaputra at Bhahadurabad point was switched southwards and opened as Jamuna due to the result of tectonic uplift of the Madhupur tract.\n\nThe Jamuna is a very wide river. During the rains it is about from bank to bank. Even during the dry season when the waters subside, the breadth is hardly less than .\n\nThe Jamuna was a barrier in establishing a direct road link between capital Dhaka and northern part of Bangladesh, better known as Rajshahi Division, until 1996. This was mitigated by the completion of the Jamuna Multi-purpose Bridge. It is also a very important waterway. It is navigable all year round by large cargo and passenger steamers. Before the Partition of Bengal in 1947, passenger steamers used to ply up to Dibrugarh in the state of Assam in the Indian Union. At present two steamer ferry services link the district of Pabna with the districts of Mymensingh, Tangail and Dhaka. The Bangladesh Railway maintains a ferry service between Serajganj in Pabna and Jagannathganj in Mymensingh. The other ferry service between Nagarbari in Pabna and Aricha in Dhaka is run by the C & B Department.\n\n"}

The slump has precipitated a wave of mergers and acquisitions coupled with reshuffled vessel sharing alliances as container lines scramble to stay financially viable. Consequently; due to the decline in the industry, CSCL's parent China Shipping Group entered advanced merger talks with its larger government-owned compatriot, the COSCO Group in October 2015. By late December 2015, the two announced a formal merger after regulatory and antitrust approval. The integration plan stipulated that CSCL will withdraw its involvement in the container shipping business and cease to operate as a carrier; instead it is destined to become a container leasing and financial-asset management company. Meanwhile, COSCO Group's container shipping division; COSCO Container Lines (renamed COSCO Shipping Lines), is expected to take over as the sole operator of the vessel fleet. Furthermore, as part of the reconfiguration plan, the CSCL brand was abandoned and renamed as COSCO Shipping Development in an effort to align the company with its new identity in the merged mega-entity.\n\nThe new company formed by the integration of China Shipping and COSCO; now known as China COSCO Shipping, aims to expand its fleet size to more than 2 million TEUs by 2018, which would make it the world's third-largest container carrier in terms of vessel capacity.\n\nCSCL, established in 1997, provided fully containerized marine and intermodal freight transport, storage, and electronic data interchange services worldwide. The company called on ports across the world, and more than 30 ports from South China to North China in its domestic coastal business. It also operated container yards and trucks, international cargo agencies, and terminal facilities in many countries. North American freight services included refrigerated cargo carriage in the line's own reefer container fleet, as well as other specialized cargo container services. CSCL continued to grow rapidly until it became the eighth largest container line at its peak after acquiring minority interest in Asia Pacific Marine Container Lines of Canada. Its fleet comprised over 150 vessels, with a total operating capacity of .\n\nAs part of the integration with COSCO, all of CSCL's North American offices ceased operations in June 2016.\n\nAdditionally, CSCL and UASC (United Arab Shipping Company) cooperated on the Asia-Europe-Asia trade route by sharing vessel space in order to cut costs and improve efficiency. Both companies also ordered 5 ships bigger than the Maersk Triple E class. In 2014, CSCL and UASC entered a new vessel sharing partnership, dubbed the Ocean Three alliance, alongside the French CMA CGM.\n\nIt was announced in July 2016 that the Ocean Three alliance will be dismantled by March 2017 because of the CSCL-COSCO merger and because UASC reported a merger with Hapag-Lloyd. Furthermore, CMA CGM declared it will launch a new vessel sharing alliance; called the Ocean Alliance in March 2017 which will include Evergreen Line and OOCL. The new China COSCO Shipping is expected to also join the Ocean Alliance.\n\n\n"}

Her father was the owner of a machine tool company, later named Gleason Works, which later became one of the most important makers of gear-cutting machine tools in the world. When she was 11, her stepbrother Tom died of typhoid fever, causing hardship at her father's company because Tom had been an important helper. At the age of 12 she began working for her father to fill the void left by Tom's death. In 1884 at the age of 19 Kate Gleason enrolled into the Cornell Mechanical Arts program. She was the first woman to be admitted to study engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY , although she was unable to complete her studies at Cornell due to her required presence in the factory. Her father had hired a man to replace her in the business but the firm started struggling financially and her father could no longer afford to pay Kate's replacement and he called her home to help again at Gleason Works. She never was able to complete the requirements for a degree but through training and self-learning she earned the title of engineer and is recognized for her accomplishments. She did get some further education at Sibley College of Engraving and The Mechanics Institute which is now Rochester Institute of Technology\n\nGleason was actively involved as the treasurer as well as saleswoman for Gleason Works. In 1893, she toured Europe to expand the company's business, one of the first times an American manufacturer tried to globalize their business. Today, international sales make up almost 3/4 of the company's business. \n\nFred H. Colvin described Kate Gleason in his memoirs as \"a kind of Madame Curie of machine tools […] Kate spent her youth learning her father's business from the ground up, both in the shop and in the field, so that when she branched out for herself about 1895 as a saleswoman for her father's gear-cutting machines, she knew as much as any man in the business.\"\n\nEllen Gleason was a friend of fellow Rochesterian Susan B. Anthony, and Kate Gleason later cited Anthony as a source of advice. Gleason undertook several efforts supporting Women's Suffrage after Anthony's death.\n\nDue to conflicts with her family she left Gleason Works in 1913 and found work at the Ingle Machining Company. She Joined Ingle Machine Company on 1 January 1914. She was appointed the receiver of bankruptcy for the company, the first woman to do so. Under her guidance she restored the company and repaid their outstanding debts. The company was returned to the stockholders before the end of 1915. After her endeavors with Ingle Machine Company she turned her attention to East Rochester where she helped to finance and build 8 factories for various companies. In 1914, she was the first woman elected to full membership in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and represented the society at the World Power Conference in Germany. In 1918, she was appointed the president of First National Bank of East Rochester while the previous President was enlisted in World War I. During this period she took charge of a problem loan and used it to finish the housing complexes left from the previous loan holder. She used this to further her humanitarian efforts in Rochester, starting eight companies, including a construction company that built houses for the middle class. After this success she took it upon herself to experiment with concrete to build cheap fireproof houses at an affordable cost using a pouring method she developed. After this success she described her methods in an article she wrote for a trade magazine, Concrete, in 1921 titled \"How Women Builds Houses to Sell at a Profit for $4000\". Later, she left Rochester for business opportunities in South Carolina and California. In the 1920s she rebuilt a castle in Septmonts France for herself. As well as helping the surrounding towns to recover from the damage left from the world war. During this time period she also toured California to study adobe buildings. In 1924, she was asked by Berkeley, California to help them rebuild after a fire. In the late 1920s she began to build more poured concrete buildings in Sausalito, California, but she ran into some more issues and the project was not as successful as her buildings in Rochester. Then at her winter home in Beaufort, South Carolina she had plans to make a community of garden apartments for artists and writers but only 10 of these homes were completed at the time of her death.\n\nGleason was a supporter of women's suffrage. According to an account of 1912 National America Woman Suffrage Association Convention mentions Gleason as having promised $1,200 to the suffrage movement, one of its largest pledges. Many of Kate Gleason's personal writings testify to her and her father's contributions to women's suffrage.\nGleason viewed marriage as a hindrance to her professional life and she never married nor had children.\n\nShe died January 9, 1933 of pneumonia and is interred in Riverside Cemetery in Rochester. She left much of her $1.4 million estate to institutions in the Rochester area, including libraries, parks, and the Rochester Institute of Technology. The Kate Gleason College of Engineering at RIT is named in her honor, and her bust stands proudly in the hallway. Kate Gleason Hall is an RIT residence hall. Gleason Works is still in operation today and retains a strong connection with RIT. In 2010, RIT press published a collection of Gleason's letters.\n\n\n"}

In 2007, there was a thinking that an inland harbour could be built at Sabroom, connected to the sea through a canal, if Bangladesh allowed it. The construction of such a harbour could reduce considerably the cost of transportation of goods from the rest of India to Tripura and the north-east of India. However, the idea had not been acted on through 2007.\n\nA bridge is to be built over the Feni River to link up with Tripura. Construction was set to begin in December 2010 for the link between Sabroom and Ramgarh. When completed, the bridge would provide the only land link between India's eastern states and its western states other than through Assam.\nThe foundation stone for the bridge was officially laid by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in June 2015. The cost of constructing the bridge, as well as the approach roads to it in both Bangladesh and India, will be borne by India. The Tripura Public Works Department was appointed to execute the project. When completed, the bridge will connect Tripura with the Chittagong port in Bangladesh providing landlocked North East India with access to the sea, and enabling the transport of heavy machines and goods to North East India via Bangladesh.\n\nThe Feni is closed near the sea by the Feni dam. This dam has been constructed in 1985 to prevent floodings by surges the lower reaches of the Feni due to cyclones and make a large area fitted for agriculture. The dam is mainly constructed by manual Labour. Between the dam and the Bay of Bengal the river is a tidal river.\n"}

She served as the first Oklahoma Commissioner of Charities and Corrections for two four-year terms, the only position that the 1907 Oklahoma Constitution permitted a woman to hold.\n\nBefore being elected to office, Barnard had worked as a teacher and in clerical patronage positions in the territorial government. She was also heavily involved in charity work.\n\nBarnard was born in Geneva, Nebraska, on May 23, 1875, to John P. and Rachel Sheill Barnard. Her mother died when she was two and the family was living in Kansas. She was raised by relatives until 1891, when she moved to Newalla, Oklahoma, where her father, a jack-of-all-trades, had a land claim. She lived alone on the claim for two years while he lived and worked in Oklahoma City. She moved to Oklahoma City in 1895, attended St. Joseph's Academy (a Catholic school), obtained a teaching certificate, and taught until 1902.\n\nAfter she quit teaching, Barnard took a business course, then became a secretary for the territorial legislature in Oklahoma City. In 1904, she was selected from among 500 applicants to be a \"territorial hostess\" at the St. Louis World's Fair. While in St. Louis, she met Jane Addams and others who were active in social reform movements. She also was exposed to big-city slum life, crime and other related social ills. From then on, she became a reformer.\n\nPrior to Oklahoma statehood, Barnard was involved in aid and charity work in Oklahoma City and was the head of the union-label organization in Oklahoma. She also participated in the Farm-Labor meetings of 1906 in Shawnee which drafted the \"Shawnee Demands\" that later formed the basis of the soon-to-be-drafted Oklahoma state constitution.\nAfter her election as the Charities and Corrections Commissioner, she was a key player in the enactment of the compulsory education laws, state support of poor widows dependent on their children's earnings, and statutes implementing the constitutional ban on child labor. She also was an advocate for working Oklahomans through the work she did in securing legislation aimed at eradicating unsafe working conditions and the blacklist of union members. She was one of the few public officials who dared to cry out against the abuse of Native American children. Barnard relied on her stirring speeches to reach the public and convince the political powers of the need for increased federal protection for all Five Tribes' members.\n\nSome have said that her most important action may have been when she uncovered the abusive treatment of Oklahoma prisoners who were being held in Kansas prisons under contract, which included forced labor in coal mines and torture. Her work and the pressure she put on Oklahoma's first Governor, Charles N. Haskell, resulted in the return of the prisoners to Oklahoma and the construction of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma.\n\nHer political career ended during her second term in office, after she began to advocate on behalf of Indian wards who were being cheated out of their land as a result of grafting. Her work on behalf of Indian children raised the ire of William H. Murray and other prominent Oklahoma businessmen and officials who convinced the state legislature to defund her office. Wilma Mankiller's 1993 book, \"Mankiller, A Chief and Her People\", on page 173 quotes Barnard: \"I have been compelled to see orphans robbed, starved, and burned for money. I have named the men and accused them and furnished the records and affidavits to convict them, but with no result. I decided long ago that Oklahoma had no citizen who cared whether or not an orphan is robbed or starved or killed - because his dead claim is easier to handle than if he were alive.\"\n\nDuring the rest of her life, Barnard continued to live in Oklahoma (often traveling to Colorado and other states during the summer due to her severe health problems) and she died on February 23, 1930 in Oklahoma City (where she was found dead in a hotel bathroom). She was buried in Oklahoma City (in a grave that was not marked until the 1980s), but today a bronze statue of her is on display on the first floor of the Oklahoma State Capitol. She was inducted in the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 1982.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1904171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904171", "title": "Walter Johannes Stein", "text": "Walter Johannes Stein\n\nWalter Johannes Stein (6 February 1891, in Vienna – 7 July 1957, in London) was an Austrian philosopher, Waldorf school teacher, Grail researcher, and one of the pioneers of anthroposophy.\n\nOf Jewish descent, Stein studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Vienna University, before completing a doctorate in philosophy at the end of the First World War, having continued work on it throughout his service in an artillery unit in the war. He became a personal student of Rudolf Steiner from about the age of 21, and enjoyed the unofficial supervision of Steiner while writing his dissertation. Broadly speaking, the dissertation was an attempt to write a theory of cognition for spiritual knowledge.\n\nAfter the First World War, Stein assisted Steiner in promoting Social Threefolding. When it became apparent in 1919 that these efforts were not going to succeed, Steiner asked Stein to teach history and German literature at the first Waldorf School in Stuttgart. It was as part of this work that Stein began his research on the Grail, which culminated in 1928 with his book \"The Ninth Century and the Holy Grail\". In this work, he attempted to identify historical people and events represented in the Grail epic and to interpret \"Parzival\" as an esoteric document representing the human path of inner development. Stein also wrote various articles on these themes.\n\nStein lectured extensively on anthroposophy and related themes from the early 1920s onward, giving up to 300 lectures a year. He also contributed many articles to \"The Present Age\" and similar periodicals, and wrote a number of short books including \"The Principle of Reincarnation\", \"Gold: in History and in Modern Times\", \"West-East: A Study in National Relationships\", \"Labour: in History and in Modern Times\", and \"The British: Their Psychology and Destiny\". Stein claimed to have had a spiritual breakthrough in 1924 using the meditative methods of Steiner and to have attained some insight into his own karmic background.\n\nStein moved to London in 1933, at the invitation of the theosophist-turned-anthroposophist Daniel Nicol Dunlop. Dunlop was director of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association (BEAMA), and chairman of the executive council of the World Power Conference. Dunlop had called Stein to London to take up a post in research for the World Power Conference; he had apparently founded the World Power Conference as a precursor to a World Economic Conference, and he had called Stein to London to assist him especially with this latter, more ambitious, project. Dunlop died in 1935 before this plan could be brought to fruition, but Stein did bring about Dunlop's wish for an independent cultural journal in the form of \"The Present Age\". Stein, having taken up various studies in economics, geography, and geology for his collaborative work with Dunlop, was able to bring together the results of this work in a special issue of the journal under the title \"The Earth as a Basis of World Economy\". The publication of the journal ceased with the start of the Second World War.\n\nDuring and after the Second World War Stein made many connections in government circles in Britain, as well as with the Dutch and Belgian royal families. \n\nStein is one of the chief characters in Trevor Ravenscroft's books \"The Spear of Destiny\" and \"The Cup of Destiny\". Though Ravenscroft claimed that he had been a pupil of Stein's, investigative reporter Eric Wynants discovered the Stein/Ravenscroft connection was a complete fabrication while interviewing Ravenscroft for an article in 1982.\n\n"}

It connects Bhuapur on the Jamuna River's east bank to Sirajganj on its west bank. It was the 11th longest bridge in the world when constructed in 1998 and at present is the 6th longest bridge in South Asia. The Jamuna River, which it spans, is one of the three major rivers of Bangladesh, and is fifth largest in the world in discharge volume.\n\nThe river Jamuna (Brahmaputra), along with the lower stretch of the Padma (Ganges) divides Bangladesh into nearly two equal halves. Until now all road and rail communication between the two parts of the country has had to rely on time-consuming ferry services that were often disrupted because of navigability problems. The need for a bridge over the Jamuna River was felt, especially by the people living in northwestern Bangladesh, for a long time. This perceived need did not go unnoticed by the policy makers.\n\nJamuna Multipurpose Bridge was constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries at a cost of $696 million. The cost was shared by IDA, ADB, OECD, and the government of Bangladesh. Of the total, IDA, ADB and OECD supplied $200 million each through a loan with 1% nominal interest, and the remaining $96 million was borne by Bangladesh.\n\nThe main bridge is long with 47 main spans of approximately 100 metres and two end spans of approximately 65 metres. Connected to the bridge are east and west approach viaducts each with 12 spans of 10 metre length and transition spans of 8 metres. The total width of the bridge deck is 18.5 metres.\n\nThe river crossing was designed to carry a dual two-lane carriageway, a dual gauge (broad and metre) railway, a high voltage (230 kV) electrical interconnector, telecommunication cables and a 750 mm diameter high pressure natural gas pipeline. The carriageways are 6.315 metres wide separated by a 0.57 metre width central barrier; the rail track is along the north side of the deck. On the main bridge, electrical interconnector pylons are positioned on brackets cantilevered from the north side of the deck. Telecommunication ducts run through the box girder deck and the gas pipeline is under the south cantilever of the box section. The bridge has been built by Hyundai Engineering and Construction (Korea) as a 'design and build' contract. TY Lin Assoc. of San Francisco carried out the design as a sub-contractor for Hyundai. The approach roads were constructed by Samwhan Corporation (Korea).\n\nThe bridge is supported on tubular steel piles, driven into the river bed. Sand was removed from within the piles by airlifting and replaced with concrete. Out of the 50 piers, 21 piers are supported on groups of three piles (each of 2.5 m diameter) and 29 piers on groups of two piles (each of 3.15 diameter). The driving of 121 piles started on October 15, 1995 and was completed in July 1996.\n\nThe pier stems are founded on concrete pilecaps, whose shells were precast and infilled with in-situ reinforced concrete. The reinforced concrete pier stems support pierheads which contain bearings and seismic devices. These allow movement of the deck under normal loading conditions but lock in the event of an earthquake to limit overall seismic loads through the structure and minimise damage.\n\nThe main bridge deck is a multi-span precast prestressed concrete segmental structure, constructed by the balanced cantilever method. Each cantilever has 12 segments (each 4 m long), joined to a pierhead unit (2 m long) at each pier and by an in-situ stitch at mid span. The deck is internally prestressed and of single box section. The depth of the box varies between 6.5 metres at the piers to 3.25 metres at mid-span. An expansion joint is provided every 7 spans by means of a hinge segment at approximately quarter span. The segments were precast and erected using a two-span erection gantry.\n\nThe Bangabandhu Bridge carries a dual broad and metre gauge railway track. It also carries pylons for a powerline.\n\nWithin a decade of inauguration, cracks were detected on the bridge prompting the authorities to impose limits on the number of vehicles allowed to cross at any given time. By early 2008, the government announced its intention to sue the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai for flawed design.\n\n\n"}

They recently played the 2013 Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Holland and the Afterburner show the following day. After their return to the states, Die Kreuzen played a secret show at a small Milwaukee club as a warm up to their May 25 concert at The Double Door in Chicago, Ill and their much anticipated return to Turner Hall on May 26, 2012. Die Kreuzen scheduled shows in Green Bay and Madison, WI and Minneapolis, MN (with Negative Approach, Mudhoney and The Melvins) later on in the summer of 2013. Die Kreuzen also played at McAuliffe's Pub in Racine, Wisconsin, July 17, 2013. A book entitled \"The Crossing: The Oral History of Die Kreuzen\" is currently in production with a tentative 2016 completion date.\n\nThe band were initially a hardcore punk band but took in elements of heavy metal, gothic rock, shoegaze and alternative rock. They have been described as \"anticipating the grunge rock sound of the '90s\" and were credited with bringing intelligence and lyrical diversity to the heavy metal genre. In 1986, Robert Palmer of \"The New York Times\" described Die Kreuzen as \"one of the new bands recasting the legacy of 70's Gothic-metal (Black Sabbath, etc.) for this modern age\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The terms Parliamentary drafter, Parliamentary draftsman, legislative drafting officer and legislative counsel are also widely used. These terms are used in relation to the United Kingdom parliament in Westminster, and other parliaments and assemblies based on the Westminster system. The official title, and organisation, of the parliamentary counsel varies between legislatures. For example, those who draft government legislation for the UK parliament form the Parliamentary Counsel Office (established in 1869 under the title of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel) while the Scottish Government's Parliamentary Counsel Office drafts legislation for the Scottish Parliament, the (Northern Irish) Office of the Legislative Counsel drafts legislation for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the (Welsh) Office of the Legislative Counsel performs the same role in relation to Senedd Cymru (the Welsh Parliament). In the Republic of Ireland, there is an Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government. In Australia, each state, territory and the federal government has an Office of Parliamentary Counsel. \n\nThe job of a parliamentary drafter is to draft the detailed form of proposed laws, in a way that will accurately reflect the intentions of the politicians who are promulgating them, without leaving loopholes or producing perverse results. This is a difficult task, and the pursuit of exact and watertight legislation has often resulted in obscure and convoluted language. Such language has been criticised both by government bodies such as the committee under Sir David Renton that reported in 1975 (and recommended drafting which was more based on principles than specific details to address every possible situation). \n\nIn parliamentary discussion, the drafter is rarely if ever referred to by name, but only as an office. However, the post has been held by a number of distinguished lawyers, for example Bernard O'Dowd in Australia, John Ferguson McLennan specialising in Scottish law (which though enacted entirely in the UK parliament from 1707 until 1999, is distinct from English law), and William Philip Schreiner in South Africa.\n\n\n"}

Approximately 40-percent of all wildfire deaths are caused by such fire entrapments, or what are sometimes called \"burnovers\".\n\nLike a backfire, an escape fire works by depriving an approaching primary fire of fuel, so that when the primary fire reaches the point where the escape fire started the primary fire cannot continue, as there is nothing there to burn. In contrast, unlike a backfire, an escape fire does not attempt to control – let alone stop – a wildfire. Escape fires are an option in grassland but do not work in forest fires, because timber burns too slowly to consume the fuel before the main fire arrives.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper described the technique in his novel \"The Prairie\" (1827), but it became well-known only after the Mann Gulch fire of August 5, 1949, when (Robert Wagner) \"Wag\" Dodge came up with the same idea independently and successfully put it into practice. He used it to clear an area large enough for him to survive unharmed when the main fire was less than one minute away.\n\n"}
{"id": "1904249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904249", "title": "Billund Airport", "text": "Billund Airport\n\nBillund Airport () is an airport in Denmark. Located northeast of Billund, it serves as one of the country's busiest air cargo centres, as well as a charter airline destination. Most major european airports are connected to Billund via multiple daily scheduled flights. Nearby Legoland Billund park is the largest tourist attraction in Denmark outside Copenhagen.\n\nBillund Airport had its beginning in 1961 when the son of the founder of the Lego Group, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, established a private 800-meter long runway and hangar north of his factory in Billund. With Christiansen as a key driver, more of the neighbouring municipalities were included in the group of owners, and it was planned that the airport should be expanded to a regular public airport.\n\nThe construction of the new airport was carried out during 1964 and the airport opened on 1 November, with one runway at 1660 meters in length and 45 meters width, a small platform where aircraft could be served, and a control tower to the controller. Hans Erik Christensen, the former chief pilot at LEGO became director, and the passengers were handled in LEGO's hangar until the first terminal building was opened in the spring of 1966. The airport was continuously expanded the following years, with new facilities, terminal buildings, lounge, tax-free area and hangars where LC Johansen's studio often participated as an architect (today called the Johannsen Architects), while other work was carried out by the airport's own studio.\n\nIn 1997 they had an architectural competition for a new 430,000 ft² (40,000 m²) passenger terminal, designed to serve 3.5 million passengers a year, north of the original airport. KHR Architects won the assignment and completed the construction in co-operation with COWI, and at the end of May 2002 the new passenger terminal was put to use, as the first phase of the future expansion, which is scheduled to take place north of the start and runway, while air cargo services, business and private aviation will continue to be served from the existing buildings south of the runway. In connection with this expansion, the largest since the beginning of the airport, it was with effect from 1 January 1997 turned into a Joint-stock company, Billund Airport A/S, with the former members Vejle County and municipalities Vejle, Kolding, Grindsted, Billund, and Give as shareholders.\n\nIn 2008, the entire runway was renovated and paved, and a new taxiway was built, nicknamed \"Mike\". This major task only took 14 hours. The runway was closed over night between the hours 23:00 and 06:00. This did not prevent a Boeing 737-800 from Ryanair landing at one end of the runway, while they worked at the other end. The same year was also a record year for the airport. 2,546,856 passengers passed through the terminals, an increase of 12.7 percent compared with 2007.\n\nFrom mid-2009, the airport was served by 9 airlines flying regular flight service, of which KLM had the busiest route with over 200,000 annual passengers to Amsterdam Schiphol. In 2011, Ryanair announced that Billund Airport with effect from 25 March 2012 would be the base for two Boeing 737 aircraft. At the same time Ryanair published 5 new routes, so that, from the summer of 2012, they would fly to 19 destinations.\n\nFrom 1 January 2007 the owners are: Vejle Municipality (34.3%), Kolding Municipality (25.9%), Billund Municipality (15%), Horsens Municipality (10.7%), Fredericia Municipality (6.9%), Hedensted Municipality (6.1%), Brande Municipality (1.0%) and Skanderborg Municipality (0.1%).\n\nIn 2014, LEGO produced a special Lego Architecture kit, which could only be bought in the departure hall of the airport.\n\nA new terminal is slated for opening in the fall of 2019. It cost more than 100 million Danish kroner.\n\nThe airport handles an average of more than three million passengers a year, and millions of pounds of cargo. The airport's main runway can handle airliners as large as the Boeing 747, although most passengers arrive on smaller aeroplanes, such as ATR-72s, Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s. Boeing 747 activity at this airport is almost exclusively limited to cargo flights.\n\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Billund:\n\nThe road distance is to Billund , to Vejle , to Kolding , to Esbjerg and to Aarhus . There are airport buses to Horsens, Skanderborg and Aarhus. Eight additional bus services operate from the airport. There are six parking zones named after countries of the world, USA, Australia, Kenya, Spain, Egypt and Greenland. Three of the zones are connected by a shuttle bus, the other three being within walking distance. A rail link to Billund via the airport is currently\nIn planning stages.\n\n\n\n"}

Other common traits of scooters can include: bodywork (so the mechanicals are not exposed like a conventional motorcycle), motors combined with the suspension or wheel (rather than attached to the frame like a conventional motorcycle), leg shields, smaller wheels than a conventional motorcycle, and an alternative to a chain drive. \n\nScooters share traits with mopeds, and some models could even be considered both a moped and a scooter. Adding to the confusion in many areas most scooters are road registered in the same category originally designed for mopeds (and often still called \"moped\" class), leading to scooters being referred to as \"mopeds\" in such areas. Underbones also share traits with scooters (eg small and step-through design), but they are generally not strictly considered scooters in the purest sense as they do not have a floor, but they are often casually referred to as scooters (especially ones with leg shields). \n\n\n"}

The neighborhood is bounded:\n\nIt includes the sub-neighborhoods of Burlingame, Altadena, and the Morley Field area (site of the Dryden Historic District). North Park is part of the 53rd congressional district, and San Diego City Council District 3.\n\nThe \"community\" of North Park as defined for planning purposes includes University Heights on the north and Juniper Canyon as the southern boundary, thus including as far southeast as Cedar Ridge Park in the officially defined community.\n\nThe North Park sign can be seen at 30th Street and University Avenue, and this intersection is often considered to be the heart of the neighborhood.\n\nIn the summer of 1893, San Diego merchant Joseph Nash sold of land northeast of Balboa Park to James Monroe Hartley, who wished to develop a lemon grove. The Hartley family began the arduous process of clearing the land to prepare the earth for the grove, but providing the fledgling trees with proper irrigation was always a problem. Barrels of water had to be hauled from downtown San Diego up a wagon trail that would eventually be called Pershing Drive.\n\nAs the growth of San Diego eventually caught up with the original Hartley lemon grove, it eventually became roughly bordered by Ray Street to the west, 32nd Street to the east, University Avenue to the north and Dwight Street to the south. Hartley deemed his area \"Hartley's North Park\" - and years later, the name evidently stuck as the City of San Diego referred to the new suburb as \"North Park.\"\n\nIn 1911, Hartley's eldest son, Jack, and a relative (brother-in-law William Jay Stevens) developed the plot into one of San Diego's first residential and commercial districts. After first establishing \"Stevens & Hartley\", North Park's first real estate firm, in 1905, Jack and William built North Park's first \"high rise\" commercial building, the Stevens building, on the northwest corner of 30th Street and University Avenue (today's \"Western Dental\" building) in 1912. \"Thirtieth & University\" became North Park's symbolic place name - and within 10 years, this became the heart of the community.\n\nLater in the 1910s, North Park became one of the many San Diego neighborhoods connected by the Class 1 streetcars and an extensive San Diego public transit system that was spurred by the Panama-California Exposition of 1915 and built by John D. Spreckels. These streetcars became a fixture of this neighborhood until their retirement in 1949.\n\nNorth Park was the site of the crash of PSA Flight 182, California's deadliest aviation accident to date.\n\nAlthough North Park 92104 is a neighborhood of mixed architectural styles from many eras, one area of note is the Morley Field area of North Park. Named for its proximity to Balboa Park's Morley Field Sports Complex, this area is lined with turn-of-the-century Craftsman Bungalows and California Bungalows. Because many of the homes were designed by renowned designer and builder David Owen Dryden, the area is the site of the \"Dryden Historic District.\" This historical district includes the homes along 28th and Pershing Streets, both bordered on the south by Upas Street and to the north by Landis Street. North Park Dryden Historic District was approved by Historical Resources Board on June 23, 2011 An application for designation of 28th Street and Pershing Avenue from Upas to Landis Streets as a historic district was filed with the City of San Diego Historical Resources Board in May 2007. In September 2008, City staff requested additional information. The Working Group submitted a Supplemental Application in January 2009. The Supplemental Application discusses why the neighborhood reflects significant elements of North Park's development, justifies the proposed district boundaries and nominates Edward F. Bryans, who built more than a dozen homes in the proposed district, as a Master Builder. \nOn June 23, 2011, the City's Historical Resources Board (HRB) approved, by a vote of 8-0, establishment of the North Park Dryden Historic District and also approved Edward F. Bryans as a Master Builder. Of the 136 homes in the District, 104 were approved by the HRB as contributing resources to the District.\nAs evidenced above, interest in the history of North Park (especially its architecture) appears to be growing. Helping to foster this interest and awareness is the North Park Historical Society, a local volunteer civic organization. The North Park Historical Society manages a website which contains many articles about historic sites, people and events; North Park walking tours; and information about committee projects and meeting information. Some of the site's extensive collection of articles on North Park's history were written by Donald Covington - historian, Dryden Expert and North Park enthusiast.\n\nForbes magazine named North Park as one of America's best hipster neighborhoods, noting that \"culturally diverse North Park is home to Craftsman cottages, cafes and diners, coffee shops, several microbreweries, boutiques, and the North Park Farmers Market. The North Park Theater and the Ray Street Arts District are also bastions of creativity in the area\" \n\nThe Los Angeles Times writes: \"North Park has all the ingredients for the cool school: It's culturally diverse and has art galleries, boutiques, trendy bars with handcrafted cocktails and local brews, and foodie-approved eateries.\" \n\nAn eclectic and diverse array of restaurants, as well as independent coffee shops, can be found along the main arteries of 30th Street and University Avenue. The area is also dotted with bars and night clubs that cater to a wide diversity of patrons. The Linkery used to be in the neighborhood. Waypoint Public now occupies the same space.\n\nDowntown North Park contains the Ray Street Arts District. Ray at Night is a gallery walk held the second Saturday of every month in North Park. It is the largest and longest running art walk in San Diego's history.\n\nNearby, the Observatory North Park, a concert venue, occupies the former Birch North Park Theatre, the former home of Lyric Opera San Diego. The historic theater underwent major renovations in 2005. The permanent seats were removed in 2015 for its new use.\n\nNorth Park has a Farmers Market every Thursday. The market is located on North Park Way between Granada Ave. and 30th Street. The Spring/Summer hours are 3pm-sunset, Fall/Winter 2pm-Sunset. They feature over 35 independent vendors; locally grown produce/flowers; gourmet/ethnic foods; arts and crafts; books; and, often, live music.\n\nThe San Diego Music Foundation hosts a large musical festival—North Park Music Thing—in the fall on El Cajon Boulevard, which helps add to North Park's reputation as a great community for the arts in San Diego.\n\nAs a tradition every December, North Park holds its annual holiday parade. Formerly known as the North Park Toyland Parade, it is now called the North Park Lions Club Holiday Parade.\n\nLike other urban San Diego communities, North Park has a high rate of pedestrian activity, relative to other regions of San Diego county.\n\n\nTransportation is served by Interstate 805, which is accessible from the University Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard exits.\n\nUniversity Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard are the major east-west thoroughfares in North Park. University Avenue leads west to Hillcrest and east to City Heights and La Mesa. El Cajon Boulevard leads west to Washington Avenue and Mission Hills and continues east to the city of El Cajon. Florida Street connects North Park to Downtown San Diego through Florida Canyon in Balboa Park to the south, and to Adams Avenue and University Heights to the north. 30th Street connects North Park to Adams Avenue and Normal Heights to the north, and to South Park and Golden Hill to the south. Texas Street heads north directly into Mission Valley.\n\nThere is substantial bus service (bus routes 1,2,6,7,10,11, and 215 connecting to Downtown San Diego as well as to the transportation hub in Old Town). The busiest bus line corridor in the San Diego metro region, known as the University Avenue transit corridor (bus routes 7 and 10), traverses North Park.\n\nChris Ward represents District 3.\n\nThe United States Postal Service operated the North Park Post Office at 3791 Grim Avenue. This post office was closed in July 2011 due to budget cuts in the postal service.\n\n\n\n"}

Her writing is noted for its wit and promotion of equality of education and occupation for women.\n\nMary Abigail Dodge was born March 31, 1833, in Hamilton, Massachusetts. She was born on a farm, the seventh child of Hannah and James Dodge. A childhood accident left her blind in one eye. At 12, she was sent to a boarding school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before enrolling at the Ipswich Female Seminary. She graduated in 1850, and proceeded to teach there for four years, until she got a position at Hartford Female Seminary. She disliked the job, however, and decided to write poetry.\n\nEditor Gamaliel Bailey read her work in 1856 and, by 1858, she had moved to Washington, D. C. to serve as a governess for his children. From there, she sent in her publications to anti-slavery newspapers. She disliked attention, however, and chose the pen name Gail Hamilton, combining the last part of her middle name with her place of birth. Among her writings were political commentaries, making her one of the first female political correspondents in Washington. Her essays were best known for their harshness towards men.\n\nIn 1860, after Bailey's death, Dodge returned to her native town and contributed to \"The Atlantic Monthly\". Her father died in 1864 and she helped support her mother until she died in 1868. By 1871, she returned to Washington to live with the family of James G. Blaine, who was married to her first cousin, but returned to Hamilton in summers.\n\nDodge became known for her personality as much as her writing. When asked for a description for a compilation about eminent women of the day, she responded with a variation of Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Bells\" that she was \"Neither man nor woman / I am neither brute nor human / I am a ghoul!\" One of her admirers later wrote, \"She is incisive, even combative, by nature, and thoroughly enjoys a good, hot old-fashioned controversies.\"\n\nDodge was also interested in publishing matters and criticized the assumption that women writers were \"an eternal child\" when it came to understanding the business side of authorship. In 1868, after reading an article in \"The Congregationalist\" titled \"Pay of Authors\", she realized her royalty payment of 15 cents per book sold was less than the average author pay of 10%. She wrote to her publisher James Thomas Fields, who initially ignored her, eventually claimed that he spent more money on publishing and advertising her books than average. She learned, too, that Sophia Hawthorne, widow of the author Nathaniel Hawthorne, was also having similar trouble with Field's publishing house Ticknor and Fields. She abruptly ended her friendship with Ticknor's wife Annie Adams Fields in February 1868, and Mrs. Fields eventually destroyed all the letters from her former friend. In her journal a month later, she wrote of her distress, \"We do not forget to feel still the savagery... of Gail Hamilton... I really thought she cared for me! And now to find it was a pretense or a stepping-stone merely is something to shudder over. And all for a little of this world's poor money!\" After months of back and forth, during which Dodge came to distrust Ticknor and Fields and wrote to other authors including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Harriet Beecher Stowe to discredit them, she anonymously published \"A Battle of the Books\" in 1870 chronicling her negative experiences.\n\nWhile working on a biography of James Blaine, she had a stroke, leaving her in a coma that lasted for several weeks. She then returned to Hamilton, before dying of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 17, 1896.\n\n\n"}

Arthur Van Roy oversaw the running of their pub and farm, and eventually became the driving force behind the construction of the brewery as we know it today.\n\nThe De Hoorn brewery was not spared the violence of World War I, and although it was completely destroyed in 1914, Van Roy decided to rebuild it. He chose to still top-ferment his beer in the old Brabant style rather than brew it using newer methods, such as those used to brew Pilsner.\n\nIn 1929, Van Roy decided to give his beer a proper name, calling it \"Speciale Palm\". \"Speciale\" refers to the style of beer \"Special Belge\".\n\nIn 1930 Arthur Van Roy taught his son, Alfred, how to brew beer. This, coupled with what Alfred learned at the Brussels brewing school, led to the first copper brewing room with a mill being built. This brewing room is known as \"Brewing Room 1\" today.\n\nOn May 10, 2016 the Dutch Bavaria Brewery bought Palm Belgian Craft Brewers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904331", "title": "Carbonear", "text": "Carbonear\n\nCarbonear is a town on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It overlooks the west side of Conception Bay and had a history long tied to fishing and shipbuilding. Since the late 20th century, its economy has changed to emphasize education, health care and retail. As of 2016, there were 4,838 people in the community.\n\nThe town of Carbonear is one of the oldest permanent settlements in Newfoundland and among the oldest European settlements in North America. The harbour appears on early Portuguese maps as early as the late 1500s as Cabo Carvoeiro (later anglicized as Cape Carviero). There are a number of different theories about the origin of the town's name. Possibly from the Spanish word \"carbonera\" (charcoal kiln); Carbonera, a town near Venice, Italy where John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) had been resident; or from a number of French words, most likely \"Carbonnier\" or \"Charbonnier,\" meaning \"coalman.\"\n\nIn the late 20th century, historian Alwyn Ruddock of the University of London, one of the world's foremost experts on John Cabot's expeditions to the New World, suggested that a group of reformed Augustinian friars, led by the high-ranking Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, accompanied Cabot on his second voyage to reach North America in 1498. (Italian bankers had helped finance Cabot's previous expeditions.) The friars stayed to establish a mission community in Newfoundland for the Augustinian order of the Carbonara. She believed that the settlement may have been short-lived but built a church. The modern name of the town may be derived from the order and its church. If true, Carbonear would have been the first Christian settlement of any kind in North America, and the site of the oldest, and only, medieval church built on the continent. Evan Jones of the University of Bristol is leading further investigations of Dr Ruddock's claims to find additional evidence with colleagues in what is known as The Cabot Project.\n\nBy the time the British began permanent colonization of the island in the early 17th century, the name Carbonear was already being used by the seasonal fishermen familiar with the area. Most of the area's land had been granted to Sir Percival Willoughby. One of Carbonear's first residents was Nicholas Guy, co-founder of the first British colony in Canada at Cuper's Cove (now Cupids), founder of the Bristol's Hope Colony (now Harbour Grace), and father of the first English child born in Canada. He moved there from the other colonies by no later 1631 to fish and farm the land with his family in an agreement with Willoughby. The Guy family continued as the predominant planter family in Carbonear throughout the 17th century.\n\nAt about this time legend tells of an Irish princess of the O'Conner family, Sheila NaGeira, who settled in Carbonear after being rescued by privateer Peter Easton and marrying his first officer Gilbert Pike. Much is known about Easton and his exploits, but evidence of NaGeira has yet to be found. The legend's combination of romance, pirates, and New World adventure has inspired much research and numerous works of fiction on the topic.\n\nBy the late 17th century, unlike many settlements in Newfoundland from this period where men outnumbered the women by a ratio of ten to one, Carbonear was a true community with families, and many women and children to help develop the town's prosperity. It became a target for England's enemies, and privateers. When war broke out with France, Carbonear was attacked by French captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville during the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. The citizens survived by retreating to the fortified Carbonear Island, but the town, documented by the French as being \"very well-established\" and containing properties that were \"the best-built in all of Newfoundland\", was burned to the ground. During four months of raids, Iberville was responsible for the destruction of thirty-six Newfoundland settlements. By the end of March 1697, only Bonavista and Carbonear Island remained in English hands.\nOver the next hundred years, Carbonear was attacked and burned two more times by the French in their attempts to control Newfoundland, and then later by American privateers. The residents continued to improve the fortifications using their own money and although the town was repeatedly burned, Carbonear Island protected its residents. The town developed as one of the most important in Newfoundland in this period. When Judiciary districts were set up to govern the island in 1729 by Commodore Governor Henry Osborn, Carbonear was recognized and was chosen as one of the six initial districts. With new French threats, the British finally erected a fort and garrison on the Island in 1743. During the Seven Years' War, the French invaded and gained control of the fort, burning its buildings and tossing the cannons over the cliffs in 1762. They can still be seen on the beach below.\n\nThe Archaeology of Historic Carbonear Project, carried out by Memorial University of Newfoundland, has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011 in the town to reveal its colonial history. So far, it has found evidence of planter habitation since the late 17th century and of trade with Spain through Bilbao, including a Spanish coin minted in Peru. It has found evidence of other settlement through the 19th century. The first summer's work uncovered approximately 1300 artifacts. The Carbonear Heritage Society is developing an interpretive museum exhibit for these and future finds.\n\nWith the rise of the seal hunt and the Labrador cod fishery, Carbonear became a major commercial centre in the 19th century. More sea captains came from Carbonear for the foreign fishing trade than from any other Newfoundland outport in this era. Violent political riots here in the early and mid-19th century led to the dissolution of the Newfoundland Legislature in 1841 and the suspension of the constitution. Political riots were so common here during this period, especially during elections, that the term Carbonearism was coined to describe the behaviour. Rail service began in 1898 (with a 1st class ticket to St. John's costing $2) and expanded with a new rail station in 1917. It operated until the closure of the rail line in 1984.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the economy was forced to diversify. The seal hunt and the Labrador fishery had almost disappeared. Carbonear's importance as a shipbuilding centre and international port of trade had much declined. Fish processing continued to be the primary industry until the collapse of the cod fishery in the early 1990s. The fish processing plant has been converted to process crab and most recently seal. To counter these changes, Carbonear is evolving. With two college campuses, a shopping centre, a major hospital, and three long-term care facilities, the town has built on its importance as a regional retail, service, transportation, government, and cultural centre, earning it the nickname \"Hub of the Bay\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Typically it is not possible for each side to create a safe group with two eyes.\n\nOne common outcome is that one group is captured, resolving the race. In the most simple situations it is possible to predict this result, by counting the liberties on each group: if for example there are four liberties each, the advantage will lie with the player able to play first, while if one side has four liberties and the other five, the result is already decided and neither player will continue (the player who is behind will normally leave the area alone, seeing it as a future source of ko threats).\n\nThere are numerous other possible outcomes, for example a \"seki\", a ko of a direct or indirect nature, and (rather rarely) more exotic types of repeating situation such as triple ko or \"chosei\". In the more orthodox races some theory is available to help understand the status as far as liberties goes, when these are not completely WYSIWYG; but such theories are not so far able to give an exhaustive description of all capturing races.\n\n"}

Versions were also published on broadsides.\n\nThe narrator is bound apprentice in a town (which varies in different versions). He becomes romantically involved with a young woman. She steals a watch and places it in his pocket or in his hand. The apprentice appears in court the next day, and is sentenced to seven years penal servitude in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). In the broadside versions the young woman's motivation is more obvious - she has met a sailor and wants to get rid of her lover. \n\nIn the broadsides the action takes place in Ratcliffe Highway, a street in the East End of London, but in collected versions various locations are mentioned - London, Belfast, Tralee, a town in Bedfordshire, and in Dunmanway, Co. Cork. Some East Anglian singers place the action in Belfast and others in London.\n\nThe Roud Index has 98 entries for this song, comprising broadside ballads, versions collected from traditional singers, and field recordings.\n\nIt was published as a broadside ballad by Swindells of Manchester some time between 1796 and 1853, and by H. Such of London sometime between 1863 and 1885.\n\nVersions of the song have been collected from Dorset, Co. Durham, Hampshire, London, Norfolk, Suffolk, Sussex, Isles of Scilly, and Worcestershire in England, from Belfast, Co. Antrim, and Co. Cork in Ireland, from Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales in Australia and from Ontario, Canada, and Maine, USA. The earliest collected version listed was collected by George Gardiner from Alfred Goodyear of Axford, Hampshire, England in July 1907. Both Alfred Goodyear's version and one collected by Clive Carey from Mrs Terry of Chithurst, Sussex, in 1911 (and set in Belfast) contain the \"Her eyes they shone like diamonds\" chorus also collected from Harry Cox.\n\nWhile working for the BBC, Peter Kennedy recorded a version in Belfast in 1952. In 1959, a version was found in Australia. An earlier version by the publisher Swindells in Manchester is very wordy, and has no chorus. It places the events in Barking, Essex. Some of the earliest versions mention the Old Bailey and London Town.\nThe publication date of that version is probably between 1837 and 1853.\n\nAn American song called \"The Girl In The Blue Velvet Band\", credited to Cliff Carlisle and Mel Forre, was recorded by Bill Monroe, Doc Watson and Mac Wiseman among others. It has a similar plot and may be loosely based on \"Black Velvet Band\"\"\n\nFollowing the Ireland rugby team's Grand Slam win in 2009, winger Tommy Bowe sang his own version of 'Black Velvet Band' to a triumphant crowd on the team's homecoming on Dawson Street, Dublin.\n\nThe Dubliners version, possibly the best known, is slightly adapted from a version recorded by Ewan MacColl from the Norfolk singer Harry Cox in 1955, and recorded by MacColl and Peggy Seeger on their 1964 LP \"Chorus from the Gallows\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1904353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904353", "title": "Beppe Grillo", "text": "Beppe Grillo\n\nGiuseppe Piero \"Beppe\" Grillo (; born 21 July 1948) is an Italian comedian, actor, blogger, and politician.\n\nHe has been involved in politics since 2009 as the co-founder (together with Gianroberto Casaleggio) of the Italian Five Star Movement political party. Grillo became one of the most prominent example of the populist surge which arose in Europe during the 2010s.\n\nGrillo was born in Genoa, Liguria, on 21 July 1948. He studied as an accountant but did not finish university. After high school, he became a comedian by chance, improvising a monologue in an audition. Two weeks later, he was discovered by Italian television presenter Pippo Baudo. Grillo participated in the variety show \"Secondo Voi\" from 1977 to 1978. In 1979, he participated in \"Luna Park\" by Enzo Trapani, and in the variety show \"Fantastico\".\n\nIn the 1980s he appeared in the shows \"Te la do io l'America\" (1982, four episodes) and \"Te lo do io il Brasile\" (1984, six episodes), in which he narrated his experiences of visits to the United States and Brazil. This led to his appearance as the protagonist of another show, developed especially for him, called \"Grillometro\" (\"Grillometer\"). In 1986, he appeared in a series of prize-winning advertisements for a brand of yoghurt.\nSoon afterwards, his performances began to include political satire that offended some Italian politicians. In 1986 during the Saturday night television show \"Fantastico 7\", he attacked the Italian Socialist Party and its leader Bettino Craxi, then Italy's Prime Minister, on the occasion of his visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC). As a consequence, Grillo was effectively banished from publicly owned television.\n\nSince the early 1990s Grillo's appearances on television became rare; according to Mark Franchetti, politicians were offended by his jokes. When one of his shows was allowed to be broadcast live by RAI in 1993, it obtained a record share of 15 million viewers. Grillo often accuses the public broadcaster RAI of \"public financing for the parties\" that abuse it for their own propagandist needs.\n\nGrillo also took aim at the Italian Socialist Party, which directly led to him having less television appearance after the mid 1980s. Grillo also criticized Biagio Agnes, then the director of the STET, for dishonest business practices. By the early 1990s, Grillo was known for his anti-establishment comedy as well as the denunciation of public policies. While it did give him attention and the beginning of his political base, it also directly led him to the lack of television appearances.\n\nDespite this exile, excerpts from Grillo's Five Star Movement political rallies are often broadcast on television, especially on political debate talk shows. On 19 May 2014, Grillo returned to Italian public television, RAI to participate in the popular late-night political debate talk show Porta a Porta as part of his campaign for the 2014 European Parliament election. The program attracted three million viewers. , Grillo performs on stage in Italy and abroad. His themes include energy use, political and corporate corruption, finance, freedom of speech, child labour, globalization and technology.\n\nLooking for another outlet, Grillo eventually turned to the internet. This started when Grillo met a manager of a small internet firm named Gianroberto Casaleggio. He expanded his influence to a larger audience with his website \"beppegrillo.it\" once the site was launched in January 2005. The internet was seen as an alternative source for media which ran contrary to the mainstream media. Hence, Grillo was able to gain many followers who became disillusioned with mainstream Italian media. Over time, it also became seen as the \"headquarters\" of the Five Star Movement and the main hub of its activity, rather than a physical location. A year after its launch, it became recognized by \"Time\" magazine as one of the most influential websites to date. Despite the website's success, there have been a number of other websites used to ramp up support for Grillo. One such site by the name of \"meetup.com\" was used to organize rallies and campaigns making Grillo's progress even more apparent. The website was also used to discuss the political stances of Grillo as well as any other politically affiliated topic referring to Grillo.\n\nGrillo maintains a blog in Italian, English, and Japanese that is updated daily. According to Technorati, the blog ranks among the 10 most visited in the world. In 2008, \"The Guardian\" included Grillo's blog among the world's most influential. He often receives letters from prominent figures such as Antonio Di Pietro (former Italian Minister of Infrastructures), Fausto Bertinotti (former President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies), Renzo Piano, and Nobel Prize Winners including Dario Fo, Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Dalai Lama and Muhammad Yunus. As Grillo became more and more involved in Italian politics, the use of his blog to convey a political message was accompanied by a strong emphasis on the role of the Web as the harbinger of new possibilities for direct democracy and for a fairer society, making Grillo one of the leading popularisers of digital utopianism in Italy. As of mid December 2017, the English and Japanese versions of the blog seem permanently defunct. The last entry in the English section is from November 2015, and in Japanese from October 2011. The Italian version, however, continues to be updated daily.\n\nOn 1 September 2005, Grillo used money donated by readers of his blog to buy a full-page advertisement in the Italian newspaper \"La Repubblica\", in which he called for the resignation of the Bank of Italy's then governor Antonio Fazio over the Antonveneta banking scandal. In October 2005, \"Time\" chose him as one of the \"European Heroes 2005\" for targeting corruption and financial scandals.\n\nOn 22 November 2005, Grillo bought a page in the \"International Herald Tribune\", saying that members of the Italian Parliament ought not to represent citizens if they have been convicted of a crime, even in the first degree of the three available in the Italian system. He maintains a regularly updated list of members of the Italian Parliament who have been convicted in all three degrees on his blog. \nOn 26 July 2007, Grillo was permitted to speak to the members of the European Parliament in Brussels, where he drew attention to the state of Italian politics.\n\nGrillo has led several national and international political campaigns. On 8 September 2007, he organized a \"V‑Day Celebration\" in Italy; the \"V\" stood for \"vaffanculo\" (\"fuck off\"). During the rally, he projected the names of 24 Italian politicians who had been convicted of crimes including corruption, tax evasion and abetting a murder. More than 2 million Italians participated in this rally. He also used the rally to urge Italians to sign a petition calling for the introduction of a \"Bill of Popular Initiative\" to remove from office Italian parliamentarians with criminal convictions.\n\nAccording to Internet scholars Alberto Pepe and Corinna Di Gennaro, V‑day was the first political demonstration in Italy developed and promoted via the blogosphere and the social networking services. The second V-Day took place on 25 April 2008, in Turin, San Carlo Square, dedicated to the Italian press and the financial support it receives from the government. Grillo strongly criticized the Italian press for the lack of freedom, Umberto Veronesi for his support for incinerators, NATO bases in Italy, politicians (Silvio Berlusconi had recently been re-elected), and the television channel Retequattro for retaining frequencies assigned to Europa 7..\n\nIn August 2008, Grillo was the subject of a report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's international affairs program \"Foreign Correspondent\". Entitled \"The Clown Prince\", the report profiled Grillo's life, political activism, the V‑Day campaign and use of the internet as a political tool.\n\nIn 2010, he started a political movement, \"Movimento 5 Stelle\", the \"Five Star Movement\" to promote through the Internet his ideals about honesty and direct democracy. The movement became a party with electoral prospects during the 2010 regional elections, with four regional councillors being elected. The party made further gains at the 2012 local elections, receiving the third highest number of votes overall and winning the mayoral election for Parma.\n\nAt the 2013 general election the M5S won 25.5% of votes, the second most popular one for the Chamber of Deputies, but obtained just 109 deputies out of 630 due to an electoral system which favoured parties running in coalition. In the European Parliament the M5S is part of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group.\n\nGrillo announced in 2014 that he was aiming to get four million signatures to support his attempts to get a referendum on Italy's membership of the Eurozone. He collected around 200,000 signatures while the minimum is 500,000 but he announced that his project was going on despite the failure.\n\nIn June 2018 Grillo published a post on his blog in which he called for selecting the members of the Italian Senate through sortition, and possibly eventually replacing elections with sortition altogether.\n\nOn 7 December 1981 Beppe Grillo lost control of a Chevrolet K5 Blazer as he drove on a military road, forbidden to civilians, from Limone Piemonte to Colle di Tenda. Six kilometers after \"Quota 1400\" near the border with France the vehicle slipped on a sheet of ice and fell 80 meters into a deep ravine. In the car with Grillo were four of his Genoese friends, with whom he was spending the weekend of Immaculate Conception. Grillo saved himself out of the passenger compartment before the car dropped into the void and in state of shock he managed to call for help. Three of his friends in the car lost their lives: Renzo Giberti and Rossana Quartapelle, respectively 45 and 33, and their 9-year-old son Francesco.\nOn 14 March 1985 Grillo was found guilty of manslaughter.\n\nIn 2003, he settled a libel suit for defamation filed against him by Rita Levi-Montalcini. During a show, Beppe Grillo called the 94-year-old winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and Italian Senator for Life (2001–2012) an \"old whore\".\n\nWhen Italian judges were investigating the Parmalat scandal, which was then the world's largest corporate bankruptcy scandal, Grillo was called to testify because he had anticipated the imminent collapse of the dairy conglomerate in one of his shows. When the judges asked how he had been able to discover that, he said that Parmalat's financial holes were so evident that anybody who had enough ability to see them would see them, since the corporate accounting was easily accessible.\n\nIn 2012 Grillo was convicted of having defamed Fininvest in an article published in 2004 in the Italian magazine \" Internazionale \". The compensation, equal to 50,000 euros, in addition to the costs of the proceedings, was established by the judges of the first section of the court of appeal of the court of Rome.\n\nOn September 2013 he was sentenced for defaming the former mayor of Asti and parliamentary for Forza Italia, Giorgio Galvagno. In 2003, Grillo had called Galvagno \"a briber\" during a performance at the Teatro Alfieri in Asti. Grillo had to pay Galvagno 25,000 euros and interest from 2003 as compensation for damages, plus compensation for legal costs.\n\nOn 12 December 2013 the Tribunal of Genoa sentenced Grillo in the first instance for defamation against Antonio Misiani, treasurer of the Democratic Party. In May 2012, Grillo published on the front page of his blog a mosaic of pictures with photographs of the PdL (Rocco Crimi), PD (Antonio Misiani) and UDC (Giuseppe Naro) administrators, along with those of former Lega Nord (Francesco Belsito) and The Daisy (Luigi Lusi). The judge has provisionally recognized a compensation for Misiani and a compensation for the Democratic Party of 5000 euros.\n\nOn 14 September 2015 he was convicted by the tribunal of Ascoli Piceno for aggravated defamation against Franco Battaglia, professor at the University of Modena, to a term of imprisonment with suspended sentence, €1,250 fine and a provisional fee of €50,000 to the offender. In that occasion Grillo compared himself to Nelson Mandela and Sandro Pertini.\n\nOn 31 March 2017 Grillo was formally investigated along with Alessandro Di Battista for defamation following a police report filed by Marika Cassimatis, former candidate mayor of the M5S in Genoa.\n\nOn 11 July 2017 Grillo was convicted at the third and higher judgement level by the tribunal of Ancona to a payment of 6,000 euros, a provisional amount of 50,000 euros and payment of legal fees, raised to 12,000 euros for defamation against Professor Franco Battaglia.\n\nOver the years, Grillo has accumulated a number of fines and/or convictions for building abuse and other crimes, such as attempted instigation to disobedience by inviting police officers to stop protecting politicians.\n\nGrillo is often criticized for his lifestyle. In particular, critics blame him for owning a motor yacht and a Ferrari sports car, in contradiction with his environmentalist stance. In his blog he said he acquired both but has since sold them. He defended himself from similar attacks from the leader of the Democratic Party on this subject, saying he earned his pay over the years and paid his taxes on them.\n\nGrillo was also criticized for having taken advantage of the \"Condono Tombale\", a fiscal amnesty granted by the first Berlusconi government in 2001, which Grillo had publicly opposed. Grillo said during the V‑Day demonstration that he had personally benefited by only €500.\n\nGrillo has proposed that members of the Italian Parliament who have a criminal record should be banned from public office. Because Grillo was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter caused by a car accident, he cannot run for public office as a member of his own party, which prohibits those who have a criminal record from being candidates. He says he is not interested in becoming a member of the Italian Parliament. Despite this, in July 2009 he announced his intention to present himself as a candidate for the PD's primary elections, which does not imply automatic presence in the Italian parliament. He also proposed that MPs should be limited to two government terms of office, after which they may not stand again.\n\nGrillo is also criticized as being a demagogue who attacks politicians on superficial issues and their private lives, while being unable to provide a valid alternative. For example, stand-up comedian Daniele Luttazzi criticized him in 2007 in an open letter published on the website of the news magazine \"MicroMega\". Luttazzi accused Grillo of being a \"demagogue\" and a \"populist\", suggesting Grillo should choose between satire and politics.\n\nIn March 2013 a commentary piece in \"Der Spiegel\" called Grillo \"The most dangerous man in Europe\", described his rhetoric as anti-democratic, said he derived his energy from resentment, and cited the British writer Nicholas Farrell who has drawn parallels between Grillo and Benito Mussolini.\n\nGrillo has appeared in three movies:\n\nIn 2008, Grillo was featured in the documentary \"The Beppe Grillo Story\", produced by Banyak Films for Al Jazeera English.\n\n\n\n"}

Friedman that posits that the world is currently undergoing two struggles: the drive for prosperity and development, symbolized by the Lexus LS, and the desire to retain identity and traditions, symbolized by the olive tree.\n\nFriedman explains \"globalization\" by recounting stories of his actual experiences in interfacing with many of the global movers and shakers. He proposes that \"globalization is not simply a trend or fad but is, rather, an international system. It is the system that has replaced the old Cold War system, and, like that Cold War System, globalization has its own rules and logic that today directly or indirectly influence the politics, environment, geopolitics and economics of virtually every country in the world.\"\n\nThe \"Big Idea\" in \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\" is found on page 223 where Friedman explains that: \"if you can't see the world, and you can't see the interactions that are shaping the world, you surely cannot strategize about the world.\" He states that \"you need a strategy for how to choose prosperity for your country or company.\"\n\nThe book puts forward a capitalist peace theory, first published as an opinion piece in \"The New York Times\" in December 1996, called the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention; although slightly tongue-in-cheek, it states:\n\nNo two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's.\n\nHe supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an economic development where it has a middle class strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a \"McDonald's country\", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.\n\nFriedman's point is that due to globalization, countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the history of warfare, and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.\n\nShortly after the book was published, NATO bombed Yugoslavia. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in Belgrade were demolished by the Serbian people and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system \"symbolised by McDonald's\" (Friedman 2000: 252–253).\n\nCritics have pointed to other conflicts as counterexamples, depending on what one considers \"a war\":\n\n\nIn the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman evaded criticism of his theory as follows:\n\nHe also explains how globalization can cause Brazilification—the loss of the middle class and increase in income gap—of countries impacted by the trend. Brazilification is a neologism included in Douglas Coupland's 1991 book \"\". The expression was used in a similar way by the American writer Michael Lind as \"Brazilianisation of America\" in his book \"The Next American Nation\" and by the German sociologist Ulrich Beck as \"Brasilianisierung des Westens\" in his book \"Schöne neue Arbeitswelt\" (translated title: \"Brave new world of work\").\n\nIn 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's Golden Arches \"with tongue slightly in cheek\". In his 2005 book \"The World is Flat\" he offered an updated theory he labelled the Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention.\n\nThe instagram account @makebigmacsnotwar picked up on Friedman's theory. The instagrammer takes pictures of McDonald's outlets at locations around the world and investigates whether these locations follow the theory's concept.\n\n\nBooks:\n\n"}

In 1975, he left Arsenal to join up with Derby County. After playing for US club Minnesota Kicks, in 1978 George joined Southampton, where he spent another three seasons. Whilst there he had a brief spell on loan with Nottingham Forest with whom he won the 1979 European Super Cup. He then had a spell with Hong Kong side Bulova before he returned to England for short stints with A.F.C. Bournemouth and Derby County. George was capped once for the England national team.\n\nBorn in Islington, London, George attended the local Grafton, Holloway Road and Hugh Myddleton Schools. George supported Arsenal as a boy and played for Islington Schoolboys before joining Arsenal in May 1966.\n\nHe turned professional in 1968 and made his first-team debut on 9 August 1969 against Everton, on the first day of the 1969–70 season; Arsenal lost the match 1–0. George became a regular in the side that season making a total of 39 appearances. He was particularly prolific in Arsenal's 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup campaign, including against Dinamo Bacau and Ajax. He played in both legs of the final against RSC Anderlecht, which Arsenal won 4–3 on aggregate.\n\nGeorge broke his ankle at the start of the following season in a collision with Everton goalkeeper Gordon West. After being out for five months he returned to play a significant part in Arsenal's run-in to the 1970–71 Division One title, scoring five times in 17 appearances in the League. However, the highlight of his season came in the FA Cup; he scored in the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds as well as proving the difference in the final against Liverpool. With the score at 1–1 in extra time, in the 111th minute George latched onto John Radford's square ball and scored a spectacular winner from 20 yards to win the match. He celebrated by lying flat on his back with arms aloft. With that Cup win, Arsenal completed their first Double win.\n\nGeorge was prolific in the Gunners' FA Cup run in the 1971–72 season, scoring the equalizing goal in the Cup semi-final against Stoke City which Arsenal won by a 2–1 margin at Goodison Park. In the Cup Final at Wembley, Arsenal lost to Leeds United.\n\nThe latter stages of George's career with Arsenal were hampered by injuries and a rebellious streak at odds with the club's management; during the 1971–72 season he was disciplined by the club twice, first after headbutting Liverpool's Kevin Keegan, and then for flicking a V-sign at Derby County's fans after scoring away at the Baseball Ground.\n\nAs the Double-winning side were gradually broken up, Arsenal began to descend down the table, and although George hit eleven goals in both 1971–72 and 1972–73 his form declined alongside Arsenal's; he only scored five times in 28 matches in 1973–74 and he was dropped from the first team in 1974–75 after falling out with manager Bertie Mee. By Christmas 1974, he had been transfer-listed, and he moved to Derby County in July 1975 for £100,000. In total he played 179 times for Arsenal and scored 49 goals. George was ranked at No. 9 in a feature of Arsenal's greatest 50 players of all time.\n\nGeorge played his first game for Derby County in the Charity Shield of 1975 which they won by a 2-0 margin over West Ham. He spent three and a half years at Derby, where he memorably scored a hat-trick against Real Madrid in a European Cup first leg of October 1975. Derby eventually lost the cup tie by a margin of 5–6 on aggregate in all. He later scored a hat-trick for Derby against Finn Harps in the first leg of a UEFA Cup tie in September 1976. Derby eventually altogether scored 12 goals in this match of European competition, becoming the first British club to ever do so. He also had a loan spell at St George's Budapest in Australia from Derby. George, whose exploits with the Rams earned him the chant, \"Charlie, Charlie, the King of Derby\", remains a legendary and beloved figure among many of the fans of Derby County.\n\nAfter Derby, he went on to play for the Minnesota Kicks in the North American Soccer League. At the Kicks, George scored what was an NASL record for the fastest playoff goal in a 9–2 thumping of the New York Cosmos. In all he made 18 appearances while scoring 9 goals in the 1978 season for the club. George then returned to England with Southampton in December 1978. He then had a short period on loan to Nottingham Forest in January 1980, where he played four games. One of these included the final of the 1979 UEFA Super Cup against FC Barcelona, where he scored the only goal in the home leg as Forest won 2–1 on aggregate. George could not agree an extension to his loan at Forest and later returned to Southampton, playing his last league game for them on 14 March 1981 against Stoke City. In the summer of 1981 he left the club to move to Bulova in Hong Kong. He made a total of 52 appearances for Southampton in which he scored 14 goals.\n\nA year later, in 1982, he returned to England to have a short time at A.F.C. Bournemouth and subsequently rejoined Derby County for a second spell. He also had a brief spell later with Scottish side Dundee United. He then linked up with Coventry City on a short-term contract prior to the 1983–84 season, but made no competitive appearances and retired soon after.\n\nIn April 1980, George lost a finger in a lawnmower accident.\n\nAfter retiring from football he moved to New Milton, Hampshire to run a pub. He later had joint ownership for some years in a garage business. George is now employed by Arsenal in roles within corporate hospitality at the club.\n\nGeorge was capped five times for England at under-23 level. Whilst with Derby, he also won a solitary cap at senior level for England, playing for 60 minutes against the Republic of Ireland on 8 September 1976, out of position on the left wing, but fell out with coach Don Revie after being substituted and he was never picked again.\n\nAt the age of 19, George married Susan Farge and with her he has a daughter, Kaana.\n\nGeorge was mentioned by musical act Steven North and the Flat Back Four in their songs entitled \"The Charlie George Calypso\" and \"I Wish I Could Play Like Charlie George\" respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1904377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904377", "title": "Canon A-1", "text": "Canon A-1\n\nThe Canon A-1 is an advanced level single-lens reflex (SLR) 35 mm film camera for use with interchangeable lenses. It was manufactured by Canon Camera K. K. (today Canon Incorporated) in Japan from April 1978 to 1985. It employs a horizontal cloth-curtain focal-plane shutter with a speed range of 30 to 1/1000 second plus bulb and flash synchronization speed of 1/60 second. It has dimensions of height, width, depth and weight. Unlike most SLRs of the time, it was available in only one color; all black. The introductory US list price for the body plus Canon FD 50 mm f/1.4 SSC lens was $625, the camera was generally sold with a 30–40% discount (roughly $375 to $435).\n\nThe A-1 is a historically significant camera. It was the first SLR to offer an electronically controlled programmed autoexposure mode. Instead of the photographer picking a shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and choosing a lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus), the A-1 has a microprocessor programmed to automatically select a compromise exposure based on light meter input. Virtually all cameras today have at least one program mode.\n\nThe A-1 accepts any lens with the Canon FD breech lock mount (introduced in 1971) or Canon New FD pseudo-bayonet mount (sometimes called the FDn mount, introduced 1979). It can also use most earlier FL lenses and some even older R (or Canomatic) series lenses, albeit with reduced functionality. This excludes all of Canon's EF bayonet mount autofocus lenses (introduced in 1987). During the late 1970s and 1980s, there were approximately 55 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a 7.5mm f/5.6 fisheye to an FD 800mm f/5.6 telephoto, and included lenses with maximum apertures to f/1.2 and a line of L-series lenses of exceptional quality. Accessories for the A-1 included the Canon motor drive MA (automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second), the Canon Databack A (sequential numbering or date stamping on the film), and the Canon Speedlight 155A (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) and Canon Speedlight 199A (guide number 98/30 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) electronic flashes.\n\nThe A-1 is a battery-powered (one 4LR44 or PX-28) microprocessor-controlled manual-focus SLR with manual exposure control or shutter priority, aperture priority or programmed autoexposure. A fifth mode is \"stopped down AE\", in which the aperture is closed and alterable by the photographer and the camera selects the shutter speed based on the actual light reading. This differs from aperture priority in which the aperture is not closed until a photograph is taken and the shutter speed is calculated based on the light measured through the fully open aperture. Stopped down AE existed so that old FL lenses could be used with at least some kind of AE, and was also useful for photomicroscopy, manual-aperture lenses, etc. The A-1 is the first SLR to have all four of the now standard PASM exposure modes. It has a viewfinder exposure information system using a six-digit, seven-segment per digit, red alphanumeric LED display on the bottom of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in centerweighted, silicon photocell light meter. The focusing screen also has Canon's standard split image rangefinder and microprism collar focusing help.\n\nBeginning with the amateur level Canon AE-1 of 1976, there was a complete overhaul of the entire Canon SLR line. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of intense competition among the major SLR brands: Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. Between 1975 and 1985, there was a dramatic shift away from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with integrated circuit (IC) electronic automation. In addition, because of rapid advances in electronics, the brands continually leapfrogged each other with models having new or more automatic features, and less expensive components and assembly. The industry was trying to expand out from the saturated high-end professional market and appeal to the large mass of low-end amateur photographers keen to move up from compact automatic leaf shutter rangefinder cameras to the more \"glamorous\" SLR but were intimidated by the need to learn all the details of operating a traditional SLR.\n\nThe A-1 is the high technology standard bearer of the landmark Canon amateur level A-series SLRs. The other members of the A-series are the Canon AE-1 (released 1976), AT-1 (1977), AV-1 (1979), AE-1 Program (1981) and AL-1 (1982). They all use the same compact aluminum alloy chassis, but with differing feature levels and outer cosmetic acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastic panels. By sharing most major components, and an inexpensive horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, costs could be spread out over a larger production volumes. The A-1 represented Canon's bid to defeat Nikon through more features and the cheapest price.\n\nThe A-1 caused a sensation when it was released in early 1978. Most photographers were amazed at its advanced features, years ahead of the competition, but in the face of changing technology, not all comments were positive. Professional photographers worried about the long term reliability of its consumer-level mechanical and electronic components under heavy daily use, the relatively slow flash sync and top shutter speeds. Traditionalist photographers complained about an \"excess\" of automation ruining the art of photography, a criticism that was leveled at all of the newly automated cameras released in the 1980s. However, automation turned out to be the right way to entice many new amateur photographers on a budget, and paid off very well for Canon.\n\nThe Canon A-1 was a runaway best seller, as it offered new SLR buyers considerable features and value for the price. It was reliable for its day in amateur usage. But as competitors brought out their own programmed SLRs, the A-1 began to show its age. This is especially true for its horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, viewfinder information display and autoflash control. The A-1 was due for replacement when the Canon T90 came out in 1985. Canon's abandonment of the FD lens mount for the EOS design also had a significant effect on demand for the A-1 on the used market. But it is still regarded as one of the most fascinating SLRs of its generation and many are still in regular use.\n\n"}

It designates a minor infraction, as opposed to a delict or misdemeanor, or a crime.\nAny infraction of a law or regulation enforced by the agents of the State executive, that is not punishable by more than a €3000 fine for a person, is considered as a contravention.\nThe fine may also be accompanied by an additional sentence (peine complémentaire).\n\nContraventions and their penalties are determined by the executive organs of the French State, unlike délits and crimes which are determined by the legislative organs (Parliament Senate), as per Article 34 of the French Constitution of 1958.\nThe executive organs include:\n\nAs previously stated the maximum fine for an individual is €3000, and the maximum for a corporation or collectivity is €45,000.\n\nThe additional penalties are defined in the Article 131-10 of the Code Pénal.\nThey include:\n\nThe penalties are determined by the legislative organs: Assemblée Nationale and Sénat, or the government in the cases defined in article 49-3 of the Constitution (attribution of certain legislative rights to the government, in particular cases).\nThere are 5 classes of contraventions, each having a progressively higher maximum fine.\n\nIn Brazil, contravention is a sort of penal infraction — not only an administrative offense - which is considered to be less serious than a crime.\n\nSince 1941, Brazilian Law has a dual system which separates penal infractions in two main different acts.

{"id": "1904400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904400", "title": "Ely, Cardiff", "text": "Ely, Cardiff\n\nEly ( \"tref\", town + , River Ely) is a district and community in Cardiff, Wales. It is to the north of Cowbridge Road West. Caerau defines the boundary to the south as does River Ely to the east and in part to the north.\nEly is primarily dominated by current and former council housing.\nIn Roman times, Ely was the site of a Roman villa, near the old racecourse. There is also thought to have been a Roman road near the site linking to Cardiff Roman Fort and eastwards to Newport.\n\nIn 1855, the first horse race took place at Ely Racecourse, which took over from the Great Heath racecourse.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey map from the early 1880s shows just how isolated the ancient Ely village was from the rest of Cardiff. Reports about travelling along the main road over Ely Common to Cardiff talk of potholes and no shelter and a terrible journey on foot. Most of Ely was still farmland feeding Cardiff's population. A railway station had only recently been constructed, and this gave the surrounding area further potential for mass housing development.\nThe 'Ely Industrial School' on Cowbridge Road East was home to orphaned children originally from Cardiff. It had been set up to accommodate \"pauper children\" from 1863. It was very much a product of the Victorian age, and workhouse mentality, increased social awareness and responsibility saw it closing in 1903 and converted to additional workhouse accommodation for adults (though never used for that purpose), known as Ely Lodge. The children lived in what became as Ely Homes. The school was demolished some years later and an infectious diseases isolation unit was built on the same site.\n\nThe land was once owned by the Earl of Plymouth, who dictated that alcohol may not be sold on the land. As a result, like other plots of land with similar conditions, the boundaries of the old estate can be approximated by the locations of public houses around the area.\n\nTo attract business from nearby areas, establishments would be built as close to it as possible without actually being in Ely (local establishments are actually in Caerau and Fairwater).\n\nEly's rapid expansion of housing began in the 1920s to provide 'homes fit for heroes' after World War I. This came with the construction of council houses to rehouse people from Cardiff's inner-city slums.\n\nEly Racecourse had its grandstand destroyed in a fire in 1937 and was then closed in 1939.\n\nThe area is widely considered to be one of Cardiff's less desirable areas in terms of crime and standard of living. But the residents of Ely are keen to dispel this reputation, citing the fact it is a very large, close-knit community.\n\nThe area was scarred by rioting and petrol bombing in September 1991 when shops and houses were vandalised and burnt by angry mobs in the Ely Petrol Riots, one of several waves of rioting around that time which occurred nationally and resulted in extensive damage and casualties. Some of the buildings targeted in Ely have since been demolished under more recent redevelopment projects.\n\nIn June 1993, 45-year-old former steelworker Les Reed was beaten to death after he challenged a gang of youths on the estate after he and a friend witnessed them vandalising a bollard in the middle of a road. Three local youths were later found guilty of Mr Reed's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, and a fourth was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and received a lesser sentence. His friend, Phillip Tull, was also attacked but survived. After the trial in March 1994, it was revealed that three of the gang had previous convictions for violence, including one gang member who had a conviction for wounding against Mr Reed's teenage son Martin in 1991. Around this time, \"The Independent\" reported that unemployment on the estate stood at more than 30% (at least three times in the national average) and there was an ongoing problem with car crime and gang warfare.\n\nCowbridge Road West (the A48) is the predominant road running through Ely as it runs on to Canton and Cardiff city centre to the east, and to Culverhouse Cross interchange to the west near the Western Cemetery. The parallel Grand Avenue links Cowbridge Road West to the northern estates of Ely.\n\nEly is served by Cardiff Bus services 17 and 18 (Capital City Red) which operate every 10 minutes from Wood Street in Cardiff city centre via Canton and Caerau. North Ely is also served by services 12 and 13 which terminate westbound at Culverhouse Cross and eastbound in Tremorfa. Cardiff Bus services 96, 101 & 102, First Cymru service X2 and Easyway service 322 also serve the area.\n\nThe nearest station, which is accessible via Birdies Lane or Cowbridge Road, is Waun-gron Park in Fairwater. Ely railway station, which closed in 1962, was on the South Wales Main Line.\n\nEly is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Ely falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff West. It is bounded by Fairwater to the northwest; Caerau to the south (although some of Lower Ely is technically in the electoral ward of Caerau, as is Trelai (Ely) Park); Culverhouse Cross to the west; and the Vale of Glamorgan to the southwest.\n\nAll three council seats are safely held by the Labour Party, with one of the long-term representatives being former Council leader, Russell Goodway, though in 2004 when Labour lost the Council to the Liberal Democrats, Goodway retained his seat by only 62 votes.\n\nThe Ely electoral ward consists of the area north of Cowbridge Road West, while the Caerau electoral ward consists of the area south of Cowbridge Road West. However, a misconception is Caerau being a subsection of the Ely area.\n\nEly features several shopping parades. Two large supermarkets (Aldi and Farmfoods) are located just off Cowbridge Road West on nearby Treseder Way. Tesco Express and Vets4Pets are both on Cowbridge Road near the Western Leisure Centre. The area also has a large Lidl store, Home Bargains, and a small Lloyds Pharmacy on Careau Lane.

In the film, Funt secretly records people's reactions to unexpected encounters with nudity or sexuality in unusual situations.\n\nWhile the film does contain some titillating material and both male and female full frontal nudity, a large amount of the film involves Funt talking to people about sexuality and sexual topics. Whereas Funt's other productions had to fall within Federal Communications Commission guidelines prohibiting nudity and sexual content on the airwaves, this film was outside the FCC's jurisdiction and Funt was free to incorporate them into the film.\n\nIn the U.S., the film was originally rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America; an edited version was rated R in 1982. When submitted to the British Board of Film Classification in 1970, the film was originally rejected, then rated X; a 1988 video release was rated 18.\n\nThe film was released on VHS in the 1980s, with a DVD released on December 6, 2011.\n\n\nRoger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" reported that although \"a few naked ladies do appear,\" the film \"is mostly given over to verbal teases, to more or less straight interviews about sex, and to tributes to the cuteness of little kids.\" Greenspun noted that the film usually \"tries milking laughs from the device of asking expert opinion of people who don't know what they are talking about. The results range from the dully ridiculous to the unspeakably vulgar. At its lowest moment, the film allows three loud, stupid, ugly old women to discuss their reactions to (I believe) 'I Am Curious (Yellow).'\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"This could have been done as well with suggested nudity or even partial exposure, but Funt confronts several supposedly uninformed individuals with a completely naked female as they're emerging from an elevator. The results, initially, are funny, but quickly reach the point of seeming repetitious.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote that he was not looking forward to seeing it because \"I expected a peep show. Instead, I found 'Naked Lady' to be a fresh look at stale attitudes.\"\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wondered what took Funt so long to do a project like this one, but now that he had, \"the results not surprisingly are hilarious beyond anything he could dare present on television.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" noted, \"As a sex survey, the film is inconclusive and only sporadically funny, but Funt has probably hit on the kind of exploitation movie that will appeal to the broad popular audience.\" Brian Davis of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"Funt's initial idea of confronting office workers with a completely naked woman is undeniably diverting, but the potential of this particular notion is strictly limited, and his subsequent devices for causing innocent citizens sexual embarrassment become increasingly desperate.\"\n\n\n"}

(TV series)\n\nWho's Your Daddy? was a Fox television prime time 90-minute special hosted by actress Finola Hughes. It centered on a young woman, TJ Myers, being reunited with her biological father, who had not seen her since she was born. The first of six planned episodes aired in January 2005, but low ratings and strong controversy prompted Fox to shelve the remaining episodes indefinitely. They have since appeared on Fox Reality.\n\nThe show's premise was that an adult who had been put up for adoption as an infant was placed in a room with 25 men, one of whom was their biological father. If the contestant could correctly pick out who was their father, the contestant would win $100,000. If they chose incorrectly, the person that they incorrectly selected would get the $100,000, although the contestant would still be reunited with his or her father. This show drew controversy from adoption rights organizations, leading to one Fox affiliate (WRAZ in Raleigh, North Carolina) declining to air the series pilot, a 90-minute special.\n\nThe first adoption contestant was actress T. J. Myers. After the pilot finished fourth in the Nielsen ratings for its time slot, Fox decided not to broadcast the other five episodes that had been produced. However, the pilot aired as a 'special' and not as a 'series premiere' so technically the series was canceled before airing an episode. United Press International reported that Myers \"guessed which of eight men was her father. She guessed correctly and won $100,000.\"\n"}

Despite receiving a heavy promotional push from CBS, the program averaged only 4.2 million viewers during its 8:00-9:30PM ET/PT time slot, which made it CBS's lowest-ranked show of the week. The following Saturday, the network replaced it with a re-run of \"Cold Case\", a crime drama.\n\nThe quick cancellation of \"The Will\" was lampooned on an episode of the ABC late night talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" with a montage of clips from the show, and the message \"Will Miss You--January 8, 2005 - January 8, 2005.\"\n\nAlthough it was initially reported that the five remaining episodes could appear on an American cable network, they eventually did air on the Fox Reality Channel not long afterwards, and all six episodes aired in New Zealand beginning in December 2005.

Philip Howard (21 September 1629 – 17 June 1694)\n\nPhilip Howard was born the third son of Henry Frederick Howard (afterwards Earl of Arundel and Surrey and head of the House of Norfolk) and his wife, Elizabeth Stuart (daughter of Esme Stuart, the Duke of Lennox), at Arundel House in London.\n\nHe was brought up in the Church of England. In 1642, he traveled to the continent with his grandfather, Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel, who had accompanied Princess Mary and her mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, to the Dutch Republic after the princess' marriage to William of Orange. In Antwerp, Philip encountered his grandmother, Alethea Howard, who was at the time living in that city. Through her influence and that of Dominican friar John-Baptist Hackett, the boy was introduced to Catholicism.\nAt the age of sixteen he joined the Dominican Order in Cremona. He was professed at Rome in 1646, taking the name Thomas. Residing at Naples for his studies, he was chosen to deliver a Latin address to the general chapter of his order in Rome. He delivered a fervent address on the conversion of England, which led to a decree being passed by the chapter, urging provincials and priors to do all they could to receive English, Irish, and Scotch novices into the order, with a view to its preservation in those countries. He was ordained in 1652. He founded the priory of Bornem in Flanders, with a college for English youths attached to it, and was himself the first prior and novice master. He also founded at Vilvoorde a convent of nuns of the Second Order of Saint Dominic, which later moved to Carisbrooke on the Isle of Wight.\n\nIn the reign of Charles II, Father Howard was made grand almoner to Queen Catherine of Braganza. He resided at St. James's Palace, with a salary of 500 pounds a year, and had a position of influence at Court.\n\nFollowing an outbreak of anti-Catholic sentiment, he left England and resumed his position as prior at Bornem. In 1672 he was nominated as Vicar Apostolic of England with a see \"in partibus\", but the appointment, owing to the opposition of the \"English Chapter\" to his being a vicar Apostolic, and the insistence that he should be a bishop with ordinary jurisdiction, was not confirmed. He was made cardinal in 1675, by Pope Clement X, being assigned the title of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, exchanged later for the Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He now took up his residence at Rome, especially watching over the interests of the Catholic faith in England. He was to have been Bishop of Helenopolis. In 1679 he was made Protector of England and Scotland. At his insistence the Feast of St. Edward the Confessor was extended to the whole Church. He rebuilt the English College in Rome, and revised the rules of Douai College.\n\nHoward cooperated later with James II in the increase of Vicars Apostolic in England from one to four, one of whom was his former secretary, John Leyburn. This arrangement lasted until 1840, when Pope Gregory XVI increased the number to eight. Gilbert Burnet wrote in his \"History\" that Cardinal Howard regretted the steps which led to the crisis in the reign of James II and which Howard sought to avert. The cardinal's plans were thwarted and the mission of Roger Palmer, Earl of Castlemaine to Rome showed the rise of another spirit that he did not share. When the crisis he foresaw came, he had the consolation at least of knowing that his foundation at Bornem was beyond the grasp of the anti-Catholic reaction in England. Cardinal Howard assisted at three conclaves, for the election of Innocent XI in 1676, Alexander VIII in 1689, and Innocent XII in 1691, and held the position of Camerlengo of the College of Cardinals. He died in the twentieth year of his cardinalate, at the age of 64, and was buried in his titular church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva at Rome. A monument of white marble with the arms of the Howards honours his memory.\n"}

Elements of the story tie in with TenNapel's previous comic book work \"Gear\".\n\nThe book tells of the adventures of Dr. Michael Ong, a paranormal scientist and former seminarian, who is assigned by the United States government to a head researcher's position at an Area 51-esque laboratory in his hometown of Turlock, California, called Research Technical Institute. In exchange for granting the government the lease to build the facility, the City of Turlock demanded that it be staffed primarily by locals. Ong's task is to open the hundreds of crates in the facility's warehouse, then to catalog and classify the items in each crate. Many of the artifacts found inside are proven to be highly dangerous and thoroughly insane...Russian teleporter technology, aliens, mutants, even a were-pig. As such, the town nicknames the facility \"Creature Tech\".\n\nDuring what is just another ordinary day at the office, the ghost of the evil Dr. Jameson looses a slug-beast from its stasis capsule. Jameson was killed a century prior, after making a deal with a demon named Hellcat in exchange for the power to bring a \"giant space eel\" to Earth. Jameson succeeded a little \"too\" thoroughly, and he was crushed when the eel crash-landed into gold-rush-era Turlock.\n\nThe ghost of Dr. Jameson, generations later, seeks an artifact in one of the crates at Creature Tech, the authentic Shroud of Turin, and released the slug-beast in order to distract the facility staff to abscond with the shroud. During the ensuing battle, Ong is stabbed through the heart by a parasite attached to the slug-beast. The parasite detaches itself from the beast and attaches to Ong's chest, replacing his heart, but creating a permanent symbiosis.\n\nUsing the Shroud, Jameson resurrects his old body and begins a search for the remains of the space eel that killed him, so that he can resurrect it and use its power to destroy the world. In the meantime, he uses his demonic powers to unleash an army of demon-possessed cats upon Turlock. It's a race against time as Ong, the parasite on his chest, the human residents of Turlock and the monsters of Creature Tech defend their town against the demon onslaught and attempt to stop Jameson from destroying the world.\n\n\"Creature Tech\" has received generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly said \"TenNapel's creativity and attention to detail fill this book with pleasant surprises and entertaining twists.\" Ain't It Cool News comic book editor Moriarty spoke well of the story, saying it is better than that of films like \"Shrek\", \"The Iron Giant\" and \"Toy Story 2\". And a review in Booklist said that TenNapel's cartooning talent \"makes a winner out of this crazed romp.\"\n\n20th Century Fox and Regency Enterprises obtained the rights to a feature film adaptation around the same time as publication, though the current state of those rights is unknown and no substantial production news has surfaced since 2002.

{"id": "1904450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904450", "title": "Hypereutectic piston", "text": "Hypereutectic piston\n\nA hypereutectic piston is an internal combustion engine piston cast using a hypereutectic alloy–that is, a metallic alloy which has a composition beyond the eutectic point. Hypereutectic pistons are made of an aluminum alloy which has much more silicon present than is soluble in aluminum at the operating temperature. Hypereutectic aluminum has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion, which allows engine designers to specify much tighter tolerances.\n\nThe most common material used for automotive pistons is aluminum due to its light weight, low cost, and acceptable strength. Although other elements may be present in smaller amounts, the alloying element of concern in aluminum for pistons is silicon. The point at which silicon is fully and exactly soluble in aluminum at operating temperatures is around 12%. Either more or less silicon than this will result in two separate phases in the solidified crystal structure of the metal. This is very common. When significantly more silicon is added to the aluminum than 12%, the properties of the aluminum change in a way that is useful for the purposes of pistons for combustion engines. However, at a blend of 25% silicon, there is a significant reduction of strength in the metal, so hypereutectic pistons commonly use a level of silicon between 16% and 19%. Special moulds, casting, and cooling techniques are required to obtain uniformly dispersed silicon particles throughout the piston material. \n\nHypereutectic pistons are stronger than more common cast aluminum pistons and used in many high performance applications. They are not as strong as forged pistons, but are much lower cost due to being cast.\n\nMost automotive engines use aluminum pistons that move in an iron cylinder. The average temperature of a piston crown in a gasoline engine during normal operation is typically about , and the coolant that runs through the engine block is usually regulated at approximately . Aluminum expands more than iron at this temperature range, so for the piston to fit the cylinder properly when at a normal operating temperature, the piston must have a loose fit when cold.\nIn the 1970s, increasing concern over exhaust pollution caused the U.S. government to form the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began writing and enforcing rules that required automobile manufacturers to introduce changes that made their engines run cleaner. By the late 1980s, automobile exhaust pollution had been noticeably improved, but more stringent regulations forced car manufacturers to adopt the use of electronically controlled fuel injection and hypereutectic pistons. Regarding pistons, it was discovered that when an engine was cold during start-up, a small amount of fuel became trapped between the piston rings. As the engine warmed up, the piston expanded and expelled this small amount of fuel which added to the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust.\n\nBy adding silicon to the piston's alloy, the piston expansion was dramatically reduced. This allowed engineers to specify reduced clearance between the piston and the cylinder liner. Silicon itself expands less than aluminum. Another benefit of adding silicon is that the piston becomes harder and is less susceptible to scuffing which can occur when a soft aluminum piston is cold-revved in a relatively dry cylinder on start-up or during abnormally high operating temperatures.\n\nThe biggest drawback of adding silicon to pistons is that the piston becomes more brittle as the ratio of silicon to aluminum is increased. This makes the piston more susceptible to cracking if the engine experiences pre-ignition or detonation.\n\nWhen auto enthusiasts want to increase the power of the engine, they may add some type of forced induction. By compressing more air and fuel into each intake cycle, the power of the engine can be dramatically increased. This also increases the heat and pressure in the cylinder.\nThe normal temperature of gasoline engine exhaust is approximately . This is also approximately the melting point of most aluminum alloys and it is only the constant influx of ambient air that prevents the piston from deforming and failing. Forced induction increases the operating temperatures while \"under boost\", and if the excess heat is added faster than the engine can shed it, the elevated cylinder temperatures will cause the air and fuel mix to auto-ignite on the compression stroke before the spark event. This is one type of engine knocking that causes a sudden shockwave and pressure spike, which can result in failure of the piston due to shock-induced surface fatigue, which eats away the surface of the piston.\n\nThe \"4032\" performance piston alloy has a silicon content of approximately 11%. This means that it expands less than a piston with no silicon, but since the silicon is fully alloyed on a molecular level (eutectic), the alloy is less brittle and more flexible than a stock hypereutectic \"smog\" (low compression) piston. These pistons can survive mild detonation with less damage than stock pistons. 4032 and hypereutectic alloys have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing tighter piston to cylinder bore fit at assembly temperature. \n\nThe \"2618\" performance piston alloy has less than 2% silicon, and could be described as hypo (under) eutectic. This alloy is capable of experiencing the most detonation and abuse while suffering the least amount of damage. Pistons made of this alloy are also typically made thicker and heavier because of their most common applications in commercial diesel engines. Both because of the higher than normal temperatures that these pistons experience in their usual application, and the higher coefficient of thermal expansion due to low-silicon content causing greater thermal growth, these pistons require a larger piston to cylinder bore clearance at assembly temperatures. This leads to a condition known as \"piston slap\" which is when the piston rocks in the cylinder and it causes an audible tapping noise that continues until the engine has warmed to operational temperatures, expanding the piston and reducing piston to cylinder wall clearance.\n\nWhen a piston is cast, the alloy is heated until liquid, then poured into a mold to create the basic shape. After the alloy cools and solidifies it is removed from the mould and the rough casting is machined to its final shape. For applications which require stronger pistons, a forging process is used. \n\nIn the forging process, the rough casting is placed in a die set while it is still hot and semi-solid. A hydraulic press is used to place the rough slug under tremendous pressure. This removes any possible porosity, and also pushes the alloy grains together tighter than can be achieved by simple casting alone. The end result is a much stronger material.\n\nAftermarket performance pistons made from the most common 4032 and 2618 alloys are typically forged.\n\nCompared to both 4032 and 2618 alloy forged pistons, hypereutectic pistons have less strength. Therefore, for performance applications using boost, nitrous oxide, and/or high RPMs, forged pistons (made from either alloy) are preferred. However, hypereutectic pistons experience less thermal expansion than forged pistons. For this reason, hypereutectic pistons can run a tighter piston to cylinder clearance than forged pistons. This makes hypereutectic pistons a better choice for stock engines, where longevity is more important than ultimate performance. Some vehicles do use forged pistons from the factory. Dodge Vipers used forged pistons from 1992-1999 model years, then switched to hypereutectic. The last generation of Vipers(2013-2017) used forged pistons. All Honda S2000s use forged pistons.\n\n"}

The inquiry was edited in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica (ed. A. Boretius and V. Krause, MGH Capit. 2, no. 253).\n\nThe document takes its name from Raffelstetten, a toll-bar on the Danube, a few kilometers downstream from Linz (it is now part of the town of Asten in Austria). There, the Carolingian king Louis the Child promulgated a regulation of toll-bars on his domains, after an inquiry dated between 903 and 906.\n\nThe customs regulations are priceless for documenting trade in Eastern Europe of the 9th and 10th centuries. The document makes it clear that Raffelstetten was a place where German slave traders and their Slavic counterparts exchanged goods. The Czech and Rus merchants sold wax, slaves, and horses to German merchants. Salt, weapons, and ornaments were sought by slave trading adventurers.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the regulations is the absence of Charlemagne's denarius, the only coin officially recognized in the Frankish Empire. Instead, the document mentions \"skoti\", a currency otherwise not attested in Carolingian Europe. It appears that both the name and weight of the \"skoti\" were borrowed from the Rus.\n\nVasily Vasilievsky notes that the document, being the first legal act to regulate the trade of the Rus', capped off a long tradition of trade between Germany and Kievan Rus. Alexander Nazarenko suggests that the trade route between Kiev and Regensburg (\"strata legitima\", as it is labeled in the text) was as important in the period as that between Novgorod and Constantinople would be in the tenth century.\n\n"}

The state country (\"Standesherrschaft\") of Muskau was the largest of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1319 it was part of the Duchy of Jawor, one of Lower Silesian duchies of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland.

The first operator was Northern Spirit, which was later taken over by Arriva Trains Northern who refurbished the fleet between 2002 and 2004, with units emerging in a new silver and red Metro livery complete with refurbished interior. In December 2004, the fleet was transferred to the then-new Northern rail franchise. Northern Rail replaced the silver and red Metro livery with Northern Purple and Blue. During 2009, 144001-013 were all repainted. As of April 2010, all Class 144s have been repainted.\n\nNorthern Rail carried out a refurbishment programme to their fleet of Class 144 trains. 144006 was the first unit to be so treated and this was also the first one to be refurbished in the joint Arriva Trains Northern/WYPTE Metro programme in 2002.\n\nThe refurbishment features the following enhancements:\n\n\nThe units more recently transferred to Arriva Rail North in April 2016 and then Northern Trains on 1 March 2020.\n\nThe Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2008 required that all public passenger trains be accessible by 1 January 2020. No Pacer train (except the prototype Class 144e) met this requirement. Porterbrook proposed an extensive refurbishment of the Class 143 and 144 units in an attempt to meet this requirement, although this would reduce the number of seats. All were to be withdrawn by December 2019. Northern ordered the Class 195 and Class 331 units to replace the Pacers, as well as taking on spare stock from other operators. However, due to the late delivery of the new trains, the 144s will continue to operate in the South Yorkshire area until the middle of 2020. In 2019, Northern received a dispensation to allow some of the class to be used until 31 August 2020, with use only permitted on specified routes.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many railway passenger services were curtailed with passenger numbers down by 95% in some areas. Northern Trains stored 18 units on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway with the other five stored at Heaton TMD.\n\nSix units have been saved for preservation, five units being two-coach units and the sixth being a three-coach unit.\n\nNot all of the preserved Class 144s are to see operational use on heritage lines. A number of class members are intended to see uses elsewhere as expansions for businesses or for training purposes. \n\nA number of organisations took part in a Department for Transport competition called \"Transform a Pacer\" where ideas are put forward for what they wish to do with a Pacer unit. One entrant intended to keep a Pacer running and update it to meet disability regulations. The three winners were later announced on the 22 January 2020 episode of \"The One Show\". The chosen Pacer units are not yet confirmed.\n\nThe Class 144e (Evolution) was a proposed refurbished variant of the Class 144 which would bring it up to the requirements of the Persons with reduced mobility-Technical Specifications for Interoperability accessibility regulations. The demonstrator Class 144e unit (144012) featured a number of upgrades such as the addition of new 2+2 style seating, a fully accessible toilet, two wheelchair spaces and spaces for bicycles and luggage. as well as Wi-Fi and media screens. The demonstrator unit was expected to re-enter traffic in April 2015, but this was delayed until later in the year.\n\nA Northern Rail 3-car Class 144 unit caught fire near in Rochdale on 21 November 2013.\n\nTwenty-three units were built in total, originally all were formed as in 2 coach sets (144001 - 144013). In 1988, a third car was added to the last ten sets (144014 - 144023).\n\nOne unit has received a name :\n\n"}

The company produced a range of Ford-based models from 2002 to 2014 under the FPV marque name.\n\nThe roots of FPV can be traced back to 1991, when the English automotive engineering company Tickford began a collaboration with Ford Australia to produce high-performance variants of the Australian Falcon range. The partnership, Tickford Vehicle Engineering, saw the introduction of the Ford Falcon S-XR6 and Ford Falcon S-XR8 models. This was followed in October 1999 by the launch of the Ford Tickford Experience dealer network and the FTE T-Series range based on Ford's AU Falcon and Fairlane models.\n\nIn 2002, following the purchase of Tickford by Prodrive, the Ford Performance Vehicles company was formed as a joint venture between Ford Australia and Prodrive. The FPV brand name was created to replace the FTE name and a restructured range was developed based on the Ford BA Falcon, seeing the return of the GT nameplate to a Falcon-based product for the first time since the \"30th Anniversary GT\", and as a regular production model since the XB Falcon GT. The range was headlined by the FPV GT-P, and included a turbo-charged model based on the XR6 Turbo.\n\nOver the years, FPV expanded the range to include a High Performance version of the Ford Territory as well as a number of special editions and anniversary models. The purchase from Prodrive also saw a factory backed V8 Supercar outfit in Ford Performance Racing.\n\nIn August 2012, Ford Australia announced its purchase of FPV assets to continue the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of that performance brand in Australia. In preparation for Ford Australia's manufacturing shutdown, the FPV brand and its range were discontinued in 2014, after 12 years of production and marketing.\n\nFPV used a number of nameplates for its vehicles. The following are the main series of models offered during the company's run. \nReplaced the Force 6 as the luxury orientated 6-cyl offering.\nIntroduced in 2004 with the BA MkII, used an improved version of the \"Barra\" 4.0L turbo. Prior to the release of the FG series F6 in 2008, the sedan and utility models were marketed as the F6 Typhoon and F6 Tornado respectively.\nSUV product based on the Ford Territory.\nLuxury orientated offering, using the Typhoon engine, but with low-key looks.\nLuxury orientated offering, using the GT drive-train, but with low-key looks. Positioned above the GT-P as the flagship model until the GT-E.\nIntended to sit below the GT and provide a lower entry-point to the FPV range.\nServed as the Falcon-based entry level product until the arrival of the GS in 2010.\nReplacing the Force 8 as the top-of-the-line FPV offering.\nHigher specification of the GT, with most options standard.\nFord Pursuit XR8 AUii 2002\n\nThe 2002 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. A FPV specific body-kit was applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.\n\nAll three were powered by a unique version of Ford's 5.4-litre Modular V8, with DOHC 4-valve cylinder heads from the Mustang Cobra R engine. FPV named this uniquely tuned engine as the \"Boss 290\" because of its power output. It produced at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm.\nFeatured Models\n\nThe GT, GT-P and Pursuit received a new stripe package with bonnet decals, a six-speed Tremec T56 manual and the GT-P received 19\" five-spoke alloy wheels. FPV also released the Super Pursuit, which was a Pursuit ute with GT-P extras.\n\nNew six cylinder sedan and utility models were added to the range, the F6 Typhoon (sedan) and F6 Tornado (ute). The F6 was visually separated from the GT range with the use of a different pattern in the front bumper grill mesh, and a smaller boot spoiler on the sedan. F6 models were powered by FPV's version of the Ford Barra engine, a 4.0 litre DOHC 24-valve turbocharged inline-six with variable cam timing producing at 5,250 rpm and at 2,000 - 4,250 rpm.\n\nFeatured Models\n\nThis new range was launched in 2005 with engine specifications unchanged. All models shared the same six-speed manual and were now offered with an optional German made ZF six-speed automatic (the same as featured in Jaguars and BMWs). The GT received the GT-P's old 19-inch wheels, and the GT-P and Super Pursuit received their own specific road wheel styles. Typhoon & Tornado versions had optional 18-inch road wheel design used on the previous model, or a new 19-inch design with black spokes. All models also received new body kits, with the F6 Typhoon benefiting from its own unique styling changes. The F6 now had color coded fog lamp surrounds, and a lower grill insert emphasizing the intercooler. The rear now had a new bumper with mesh inserts, a deeper diffuser, with the GT models now sporting a dual exit exhaust system cut into the diffuser.\n\nFeatured Models\n\nNo mechanical changes were introduced with this update; however, all models came standard with 19 inch rims. Subtle styling changes were made, but the most significant news was the introduction of new Force 6 and Force 8 models. Built to rival HSV's Senator Signature, they are mechanically identical to the auto-equipped GT model, but in a more luxury-focused package with more conservative visuals (no rear wing and more conservative colour range). The Force models are essentially an FPV version of the Fairmont Ghia (luxury model in the Falcon range).\n\nIn the final months of the BF MkII Falcon, a number of limited edition models were released - namely, the GT \"40th Anniversary\" (to commemorate the Falcon GT nameplate).; the F6 \"R-Spec\" Typhoon; the GT \"Cobra R-spec\" sedan and utility (all of which received stiffer \"R-Spec\" dampers and, in the case of the sedan, a power increase to \n\nFeatured Models\n\nSpecial editions\n\nAll models in the current FPV FG range are based on the Australian Ford FG Falcon and include the 6-cylinder F6 sedan, F6 Ute (the former Typhoon and Tornado names having been retired) and F6 E sedan, the V8 powered GS Sedan and Ute and the V8 engined GT, GT-P and GT E sedans. The 4.0 L Turbocharged Inline Six produces and , while the GT-spec 5.4 L V8 developed and . GS models used a detuned version of the GT 315 (different to the Boss 302 from the BF MK II)\n\n4 limited editions GT's were released during the FG series, the first being the GT 5th Anniversary, celebrating 5-years since the start of FPV. The \"Black Edition\" followed, and the R-Spec and GT-F arriving in the MkII update.\n\nFeatured Models\n\nSpecial editions\n\nIn October 2010 (before the FG MkII update), the 5.4 L V8 was replaced with the new 5.0 L Supercharged (Miami) V8. The GT range now produces and the GS . It is capable of a sub 5 second 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) time, surpassing the HSV GTS (the FPV's main rival) in both power and torque. The decision was brought about because of pressure to convert to Euro IV emissions, which the 5.4 L was unable to pass.\n\nDuring this time, the Pursuit and Super Pursuit utilities were dropped, with the GS being the only V8 ute option in regular production.\n\nFeatured Models\n\nSpecial editions\n\nThe FPV range received the updates from the Falcon (FG) MkII range in December 2011, however, the GS sedan and utility received the cosmetic updates from the XR-series.\n\nFPV released the track focused version of the R-spec in 2012, using the current GT with its / supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engine, creating Australia's fastest accelerating production car.[5] It is seen by many as the spiritual successor the famed \"HO\" series of GT's, that ended with the Ford XY Falcon GT. Ford (FPV) however, is reluctant to use the \"HO\" tag on a modern-day equivalent.\n\nThe GT-F 351 marked the end for the Ford Falcon GT / FPV GT model lines, the \"F\" standing for Final, and \"351\" paying homage to Falcon GTs of the 1960s and 1970s. It features a retuned version of the Coyote 5.0 litre V8 to produce , with over available through over-boost when the conditions allow, the GT-F also gain's the handling upgrades from the R-spec. The exterior is identified through black highlights on the mirrors, spoiler and door handles, as well as a unique stripe package including a stripe running over the top of the car.\n\nFeatured Models\nSpecial editions\n\n\nPresented in June 2014, the GT-F 351 is the last ever Falcon-based GT sedan and last FPV model (along with the Pursuit Ute), with a total production of 500 reserved for Australia at $77,990 and another 50 for New Zealand. Its nomenclature was chosen to mean \"F\" for final whereas \"351\" is this GT-F's engine output in kW as well as a homage to the iconic engine capacity of the 1970s GT Falcon (XW to XB series). Mechanically, the GT-F features launch control, standard Brembo six-piston front and four-piston rear brakes, the suspension and 275/35 R19 Dunlop Sports Maxx 9in rear tyre package from the limited edition GT R-spec and a retuned version of the supercharged Coyote \"Miami\" 5.0 L V8 engine (embossed \"GT-F 351\" instead of \"Boss 335\") developing a minimum of at 6,000 rpm of power (or, depending on prevailing conditions, over for 15–20 seconds thanks to a transient overboost function) but an unchanged at 2,500-5,500 rpm of torque that is, however, available across a broader range. Inside, the GT-F is characterised by darker finishes, orange accents throughout (e.g. trim stitching, instrument facia and GT-F seat embroiding) and a build number plate complemented by a certificate. The exterior features stealth or black accents (specifically, the headlight and foglight bezels are black, as are the external mirrors, door handles, rear spoiler and diffuser, alloy wheels) and a unique GT-F stripe package (including over the roof of the car) that is available in different colours depending on exterior paints, which are Winter White, Silhouette (black), Kinetic (blue), Octane (orange) and Smoke (grey).\n\nThe NSW highway patrol acquired one of these last ever FPV GT sedans (build number 88 out of 500 allocated to the domestic market) which, as a unique special, had the engine tuned by Ford racing legend Dick Johnson to . This gave it far more power than Australian racing V8 Supercars and it is, as of 2015, Australia's most powerful police vehicle. It was commissioned by the NSW police force as a promotional car, although it is a fully equipped and operational highway patrol police vehicle.\n\nFPV auctioned build number 001 and the last (for Australia) build number 500 on eBay, with a view to donate proceedings to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. These cars were sold for $236,100 and $157,600 and attracted 84 and 106 bids, respectively.\n\nIn January 2008, Ford Performance Vehicles unveiled the FPV F6X, a high-performance, luxury version of the Ford Territory crossover. The F6X is fitted with the F6 270 Turbo 4.0 L DOHC in-line six-cylinder engine, a ZF six-speed automatic transmission and a full-time all-wheel-drive system. It is the first non Falcon-based model to be produced by FPV and, with an engine producing and , was claimed by the company to be the most powerful six-cylinder SUV available in Australia at that time.\n\nThe F6X was discontinued in February 2009, with 251 examples having been built.\n\nDuring a 2004 FPV open day, FPV had a clay model of a Fairlane on display. It Featured a custom front end with GT headlamps and bonnet, and a custom bodykit.\n\nFor a 2007 open day, FPV had a Territory-based concept on display. The P-SUV had an open rear section behind the rear seats. The floor of the open rear section and its extension was covered in machine finish metal sheets with the same material covering the fold-down rear seat backs.\n\nFor the 2011 Melbourne motor show, FPV displayed the \"FLPV concept\" (commonly known as the \"Black Edition\"), based on the just released supercharged GT series. It featured an all-black appearance, and a unique front bumper and staggered wheel design at the time considered to be available on future FPV products. However, these failed to make an appearance, with only the use of wider rear wheels making the R-spec and GT-F limited editions.\n\nBased on the cast iron 4V DOHC Boss short blocks sourced from Windsor, Ontario, the Boss engines include some locally sourced parts such as intake and pistons coupled with DOHC 4-valve cylinder heads from the Mustang Cobra R engine. FPV named this uniquely tuned engine as the Boss 290 because of its power output. It produced 290 kW (394 PS; 389 bhp) at 5,500 rpm and 520 N·m (380 lb·ft) of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\nFor the BFII FPV GT Cobra special edition, the Boss 302 was created. The GT Cobra motor produced 405 hp (302 kW) and 398 lb·ft (540 N·m)). The Boss 302 motor was also added to all V8-powered FPV models until the release of the FG in 2008.\n\nFor the FG MkI, the 5.4 was further tuned to produce 315 kW (428 PS; 422 bhp) and 551 N·m (406 lb·ft). FPV achieved this through a new camshaft profile, new camshaft timing, strengthened piston assembly and a higher compression ratio (10.5:1 to 10.8:1).\n\nIn October 2010 FPV retired the 5.4L Boss V8, in favour of a new supercharged 5.0L V8. The project, codenamed \"Miami\", is based on the Coyote 5.0 litre V8 and is a supercharged alloy quad cam engine. It has cost FPV $40 million and has taken 3 years to develop. The engine was offered in three versions, Boss 315, 335 and finally 351.\n\nWith the closure of FPV, the Boss 335 engine was used in the returning XR8 model with the FG-X range. Another variation was developed for the special edition XR8 sprint, that developed .\n\nUsed in the entry level GS sedan and ute, the Boss 315 produces 315 kW (428 PS; 422 bhp) at 5,750 rpm and 545 N·m (402 lb·ft) between 2,000 - 5,500 rpm.\n\n\nAvailable in the GT range, the Boss 335 kW (455 PS; 449 bhp) between 5,750 - 6,000 rpm and between 2,200 - 5,500 rpm. The latter is offered in the GT range, which includes GT, GT-P, and GT-E. Fuel economy was improved dropping 4.5% to 13.7 L/100 km for the auto and 13.6 L/100 km for the manual.\n\nBoss 345\n\nExclusive to the FG X XR8 Sprint, the Boss 345 developed 345 kW of power and 575 Nm of torque, with base torque figures being just 1 Nm shy of the XR6 Sprint. In favourable atmospheric conditions, overboost mode raised the output to 400 kW / 650 Nm, being equal with the figures produced by the FPV GT-F. The Boss 345 had the build number inscribed onto the top of the engine, instead of any reference to power figures as with previous iterations.\n\n\nThis is a specially tuned variant of the 5.0L unique to the GT-F, similar to the Cobra before it, the 351 is a reference to the Cleveland engines offered in the Falcon in the past. \n\n\nFor the BA/BF F6 Typhoon and Tornado models, the boost from the Garrett GT3540 turbocharger was increased over the Barra 240, producing at 5,250 rpm and of torque at 2,000-4,000 rpm\n\n\nWith the FG series, the Garret GT3540 was retained as opposed to the smaller GT3576 used in the FG XR6 Turbo. This is the most powerful engine with at 5,250 rpm and of torque at 1,950-5,200 rpm (and the first to produce more than 100 hp (75 kW) per litre) manufactured in Australia. As a result, \n\n\nExclusively fitted to the FGX XR6 Turbo Sprint. It was essentially a Barra 270T with a Garrett GT3540 and revised carbon fibre intake.\n\nFord Performance Racing (FPR) was created by Prodrive in 2003 to establish a link between the FPV road car range and the Ford Falcon V8 Supercars. Given the team's massive budget, its early results were disappointing but a form reversal in 2006 saw the team finish second in the Teams' standings. Mark Winterbottom also placed second in the Drivers Championship in 2008. In January 2013 the team was sold by Prodrive to Rusty French and Rod Nash. The team achieved their first Bathurst 1000 victory in 2013 with Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards driving a Falcon FG. In 2015, Ford Performance Racing was renamed as Prodrive Racing Australia as a result of Ford's decision to progressively withdraw its V8 Supercars support by 2016.\n\nFPR drivers have included Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton, Greg Ritter, David Brabham, David Besnard, Jason Bright, Mark Winterbottom, Steven Richards and Will Davison.\n\nFPV created a show car dubbed the 'DRIF6' - an F6 Typhoon with modifications making the car suitable for competitive drifting. The car was entered into the national-level Drift Australia Series in 2006, where it was driven by Adam 'Newtonmeter' Newton. One of the car's main objectives was to expose the FPV brand to a younger audience than its usual, traditional V8-driving crowd.\n\nApart from Adam Newton, only Gary Myers of Summernats Burnout fame has driven the car. Gary drove the F6 for Street Machine Magazine, and commented the vehicle had incredible power.\n\nThe F6 drift car managed to score a best qualifying position of 5th at Mallala Motorsport Park in Adelaide, South Australia. In the Queensland Round of racing, the car suffered damage when Warren Luff, a professional race driver, took to the wheel for a few demo laps. Under Warren's control the car only made the end of the back straight of Queensland Raceway before it was turned passenger side first into the wall and Warren ended up in hospital with a fractured nose.\n\nThe damaged vehicle made an appearance in China to bolster one of its sponsors agendas. Ford Australia brought the vehicle back to Australia and it can be seen at the Ford Australia Discovery Centre in Geelong Victoria.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904477", "title": "West End Girls", "text": "West End Girls\n\n\"West End Girls\" is a song by the English pop duo Pet Shop Boys. Written by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, the song was released twice as a single. The song’s lyrics are concerned with class and the pressures of inner-city life which were inspired partly by T. S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land\". It was generally well received by contemporary music critics and has been frequently cited as a highlight in the duo's career.\n\nThe first version of the song was produced by Bobby Orlando and was released on Columbia Records' Bobcat Records imprint in April 1984, becoming a club hit in the United States and some European countries. After the duo signed with EMI, the song was re-recorded with producer Stephen Hague for their first studio album, \"Please\". In October 1985, the new version was released, reaching number one in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, the song won Best Single at the Brit Awards, and Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards. In 2005, 20 years after its release, the song was awarded Song of The Decade between the years 1985 and 1994 by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 12th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.\n\nThe song was performed by Pet Shop Boys at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.\n\nIn 1983, Neil Tennant met producer Bobby Orlando, while on an assignment in New York interviewing Sting for \"Smash Hits\". After listening to some demos, Orlando offered to produce for the duo.\n\nIn 1983–84, the duo recorded twelve songs with Orlando, at Unique Studios in New York, \"West End Girls\", \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\", \"One More Chance\", \"I Want a Lover\", \"Thats My Impression\", \"A Man Could Get Arrested\", \"I Get Excited\", \"Two Divided by Zero\", \"Rent\", \"It's A Sin\", \"Pet Shop Boys\", and \"Later Tonight\". Orlando played most of the instruments on \"West End Girls\", including the jazz riff at the end. Lowe played one chord and the bassline. It included a drum part lifted from Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\", and an arrangement involving what Tennant called \"Barry White chords\". Orlando was thrilled by the song's production; his idea was to make a rap record in a British accent.\n\nIn April 1984, \"West End Girls\" was released, becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and a minor dance hit in Belgium, and France, but was only available in the United Kingdom as a 12\" import. In March 1985, after long negotiations, Pet Shop Boys cut their contractual ties with Orlando, and hired manager Tom Watkins, who signed them with EMI. They re-recorded \"West End Girls\" with producer Stephen Hague, and re-released the song in late 1985, topping the charts in both the UK and the US.\n\n\"West End Girls\" is a synthpop song influenced by hip hop music. The song's socially conscious streak, as well as the propulsive bass line, derives from Grandmaster Flash's protest rap song \"The Message\". Lowe and Hague created a \"snaky, obsessive rhythm punch\" for the music, replacing the song's previously sparse beats and minimal keyboard lines.\n\nTennant started to write the song when he was staying at his cousin's house in Nottingham while watching a gangster film. Just when he was going to sleep he came up with the lines: \"Sometimes you're better off dead, there's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head\". The lyrics were inspired by T.S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land\", particularly in the use of different narrative voices and arcane references. The song's lyrics are largely concerned with class, inner-city pressure. Tennant later said that some listeners had assumed the song referred to prostitutes, but was actually, \"about rough boys getting a bit of posh.\"\n\nThe lyric \"From Lake Geneva to the Finland Station\" refers to the train route taken by Vladimir Lenin when he was smuggled by the Germans to Russia during World War I, a pivotal event in the Russian Revolution. Indeed, it is highly likely the lyric was inspired by the book \"To the Finland Station\" by Edmund Wilson, a famous work on the history of revolutionary thought and Socialism that Tennant would have at least heard of, if not read, as a student. The Bobby Orlando-produced version of the single included another line, \"All your stopping, stalling and starting/Who do you think you are, Joe Stalin?\" which was removed for the 1985 version.\n\n\"West End Girls\" has been generally well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic in a review of the album \"Please\" called the song \"hypnotic\", adding that \"it's not only a classic dance single, it's a classic pop single\". In a review for the group's second studio album \"Actually\", Rob Hoerburger from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine commented that \"West End Girls\" was \"as catchy as anything on the radio in 1986\", praising \"its enticing bass line and foreboding synth riffs\", but felt that it was almost \"nullified by peevish spoken asides and the cryptic posturing of the duo's lyrics\". In a review of the live album \"Concrete\", Michael Hubbard from musicOMH said that \"West End Girls\" was one of the songs that \"round out a collection that never feels too long or superfluous\", adding that it \"goes some way to installing Tennant and Lowe as national treasures\".\n\nNitsuh Abebe from Pitchfork Media, in a review of their compilation album \"\" commented that in the song \"we meet Tennant not as a singer, but as a speaker\", adding that \"he mumbles the verses to us not like a star, but like a stranger in a raincoat, slinking alongside you and pointing out the sights\".\n\nIn 1987, \"West End Girls\" won for Best Single at The BRIT Awards, and for Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards. In 2005, the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters gave to \"West End Girls\" the Ivor Novello Award for Song of The Decade between the years 1985 and 1994.\n\nThe video was directed by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At the beginning of the video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant power-walks imperiously while Lowe casually follows behind. While Tennant delivers the lyrics & chorus directly at the viewer, Lowe appears at times disinterested in the proceedings or preoccupied with other goings-on around them.\n\nThen the video shows various shots at Waterloo Station, as the chorus starts. In slow motion, the camera pans across the WHSmith shop on the station concourse as the duo walk past. It cuts to a brief shot of a No. 42 red double-decker bus, showing the destination as Aldgate, also advertising the stage-show \"Evita\", then black and white shots of the Tower Bridge, Westminster and the Westminster Palace Clock Tower from the sky. The duo poses on the South Bank of the River Thames in a pastiche of a postcard image, with the Houses of Parliament as a background.\n\nThe camera shows shots of young women, and passes through arcades and cinemas in Leicester Square. The camera now passes South Africa House showing protestors in the Non-Stop Picket, an anti-apartheid vigil.

The song was a club hit in the United States, and in some European countries, such as Belgium, where it debuted at number 24 on the VRT Top 30 chart on 28 July 1984, peaking at 17 four weeks later. In Canada, \"West End Girls\" first entered the \"RPM\" singles chart in April 1985, reaching a peak position of 81 in June 1985.\n\nHaving signed with EMI, the group released their first major label single \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\" in mid-1985, but it failed to attract attention. The Pet Shop Boys then decided to re-record \"West End Girls\", and issue this new version as a single. Producer Stephen Hague helmed the new, re-recorded version of \"West End Girls\".\n\nThe re-recorded version of \"West End Girls\" was released in the United Kingdom in October 1985, debuting on the UK Singles Chart at number 80, and within eight weeks of its release it had reached the top of the chart, becoming the first hip hop song to top the UK charts and the first British hip hop song to top a national chart. It maintained the number one position for two weeks and received a gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in January 1986. Across Europe, \"West End Girls\" also topped the singles chart in Norway, as well as peaking in the top three in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nIn Canada, where the original recording of \"West End Girls\" had already been a minor hit in 1985, the re-recorded version was issued as a single in early 1986. The re-recorded song entered the chart in March 1986, peaking at number one for one week on 17 May 1986. In the United States, \"West End Girls\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 71, reaching the number one position on 10 May 1986, and remained on the chart for 20 weeks. The song also peaked at number one on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart for two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe titles \"Nouvelle version\" and \"original 7\" version\" do not appear on any releases.

{"id": "1904481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904481", "title": "Mordechai Breuer", "text": "Mordechai Breuer\n\nMordechai Breuer (; May 14, 1921 – February 24, 2007) was a German-born Israeli Orthodox rabbi. He was one of the world's leading experts on Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), and especially of the text of the Aleppo Codex.\n\nHis first cousin was the historian also named Mordechai Breuer. Breuer was a great-grandson of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.\n\nMordechai Breuer was born in 1921 to Samson and Else Leah Breuer. His paternal grandfather was Rabbi Dr. Salomon Breuer, son-in-law of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. His mother died while Mordechai was a young child, and his father then married Agatha Jeidel. At age twelve, he and his family emigrated to then-British Palestine. There, he studied at Yeshivat Hebron and Yeshivat Kol Torah. He taught Tanakh in several yeshivot and schools in Israel beginning in 1947. In 1999 he was awarded the Israel Prize for original Rabbinical Literature. He also received an honorary doctorate by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nBreuer's position was that only a single correct text of Tanakh existed; any variants from this authoritative edition were therefore errors. Breuer's approach to establishing this correct text and punctuation of Tanakh was at first eclectic, based on several early manuscripts (and the Venice edition of Mikra'ot Gedolot) and their masoretic notes, as well as notes from Wolf Heidenheim and Minḥat Shai (Rabbi Solomon Norzi). He later gained access to the Aleppo Codex (dating from the tenth century) and found it to match almost perfectly with his work, supporting his thesis of only one correct edition. His edition was first published by Mossad Harav Kook in the Da'at Mikra series and as its own volume. It was republished in 1998 and 2001 by different publishers. The last is the modern edition of the Tanakh known as Keter Yerushalayim (), referred to in English as the Jerusalem Codex. It is based graphically on the Aleppo Codex, and is now the official Tanakh of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and of the Israeli Knesset.\n\nHe was known for developing \"Shitat Habechinot\" (\"the aspect approach\") which suggests that differing styles and internal tensions in the Biblical text represent different \"voices\" of God or Torah, which cannot be merged without losing their identity. According to Breuer, God wrote the Torah from \"multiple perspectives … each one constituting truth, [for] it is only the combination of such truths that gives expression to the absolute truth.\" If applied, this approach would provide an alternative framework to the documentary hypothesis, which maintains that the Torah was written by multiple authors.\n\nIn his two volume book Pirkei Moadot (1986), Rabbi Breuer discusses twenty eight topics, mostly holidays like Shabbat, Pesach, Shavuot, and Hanukkah. The majority of the essays address the peshat or simple understanding of the Biblical text (written law) and attempt to clarify how it corresponds with the halakha or rabbinic law. A few of the essays address issues of oral law. For example, in one of his essays on Pesach, he discusses why and how the order of the Pesach Seder has changed since the destruction of the Temple. Originally, the korban Pesach was eaten after saying kiddush and drinking the first cup of wine. He explains how and why the Seder developed as presented in the Haggadah nowadays. In the introduction, he articulates his methodology for ascertaining the peshat of the Biblical text and demonstrates this method in several of the essays.\n\nHe authored five other works: One on the Aleppo Codex, one on Taamei Hamikra, Pirkei Bereishit, Pirkei Mikraot, and Pirkei Yeshayahu. Breuer also translated Samson Raphael Hirsch's Commentary on the Pentateuch that was written in German into Hebrew together with his cousin Mordechai Breuer.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1904505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904505", "title": "Partwork", "text": "Partwork\n\nA partwork is a written publication released as a series of planned magazine-like issues over a period of time. Issues are typically released on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, and often a completed set is designed to form a reference work on a particular topic.\n\nPartwork series run for a determined length and have a finite life. Generally, partworks cover specific areas of interest, such as sports, hobbies, or children's interest and stories such as \"PC Ace\" and the successful \"The Ancestral Trail\" series by Marshall Cavendish Ltd. They are generally sold at newsagents and are mostly supported by massive television advertising campaigns for the launch. In the United Kingdom, partworks are usually launched by heavy television advertising each January.\nPartworks often include cover-mounted items with each issue that build into a complete set over time. For example, a partwork about art might include a small number of paints or pencils that build into a complete art-set; a partwork about dinosaurs might include a few replica bones that build a complete model skeleton at the end of the series; a partwork about films may include a DVD with each issue. In Europe, partworks with collectable models are extremely popular; there are a number of different publications that come with character figurines or diecast model vehicles, for example: The James Bond Car Collection.\n\nIn addition, completed partworks have sometimes been used to create case-bound reference works and encyclopedias. An example is the multi-volume \"Illustrated Science and Invention Encyclopedia\" which was created with material first published in the \"How It Works\" partwork.\n\nAccording to the Periodical Publishers Association in 2003, partworks were the fourth-best selling magazine sector in the UK, after TV listing guides, women's weeklies and women's monthlies. A common inducement is a heavy discount for the first one or two issues. The same series can be sold worldwide in different languages and even in different variations.\n\nPrior to the invention of printing, the Pecia System was used in European university cities. Books were divided into sections known as \"Pecia\". Students or other individuals could rent the individual pieces and copy them by hand. In this way, several individuals could work on copying one book at the same time.\n\nWith the advent of printing, \"serialized publication\" came into use by printers and publishers. Between 1728 and 1732, Nicolas Tindal's English translation of Paul de Rapin's \"L'Histoire d'Angleterre\" (The History of England) was issued by a London printer in monthly parts. A rival printer then tried to compete by selling another translation of de Rapin's work in weekly, six-penny installments. An edition of \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\" was issued in three-penny installments in 1732. At the time, printing a book was a lengthy process, copies of each section of the book being printed in turn until the work was complete; the sections would then be collated and the print-run of books could then be sold. The alternative of selling individual sections as soon as they were printed would enable the printer could gain a steady income while the book was being produced, and potentially increase sales by selling to people who could not afford the upfront cost of a copy of the complete book.\n\nIn the 19th century, many of Charles Dickens' novels were first published as partworks. For example, \"The Pickwick Papers\" was first published in 19 parts, between 1836 and 1837. \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" was first published in 88 weekly parts between April 1840 and November 1841.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, partwork serialized encyclopedias were issued. Publishers soon branching out to topics, including cookery books and series on gardening and car maintenance.\n\nPartworks, particularly those that contain parts for the production of a model or similar collectable items that are individually of little value, often draw criticism for the extremely high prices of their finished product. One example, released in the UK in 2009, required the purchase of 125 issues to collect the parts for a static, model aircraft; the total would be £620.25. Examples of other models that cost over £400 to produce are cited, and some subscribers complain they have parts missing that they are unable to replace.\n\n\n"}

Canadian pop group The Original Caste first recorded it in 1969 for both the TA label and its parent Bell label. \n\nThe song, recorded by various artists, charted each year from 1969 to 1974 on various charts in the United States and Canada. However, it did not chart outside North America. \n\n\"One Tin Soldier\" went to number 6 on the \"RPM Magazine\" charts, hit the number 1 position on CHUM AM in Toronto on 27 December 1969, and reached number 34 on the American pop charts in early 1970. It was a bigger Adult Contemporary hit, reaching number 25 U.S. AC and number 5 Canada AC.\n\nA 1971 cover was a hit in the U.S. for Jinx Dawson, lead vocalist of Coven, whose re-recording was featured in the film \"Billy Jack\". The single went to number 26 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart before it was pulled from radio by the film's producer. On November 20, 1971, Coven performed \"One Tin Soldier\" on the Dick Clark ABC-TV Saturday-afternoon program \"American Bandstand\". A re-recorded version by Coven made the \"Billboard\" chart in 1973, peaking at number 79.\n\nIn 1972, Skeeter Davis had moderate success on the American country charts with her rendering, but did very well in Canada, peaking at number 4 on the country chart and number 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Davis received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Country Vocal.\n\nAlthough \"One Tin Soldier\" has been said to have the same harmonic base as Pachelbel's Canon, it merely has some aural similarities in the verses and has several significantly different chords. \n\n\"One Tin Soldier\" tells the story of two neighboring tribes, the warlike Valley People and the peaceful Mountain Kingdom which possesses a great treasure buried under a stone. The Valley People demand the treasure. The Mountain People respond that they will share it with \"their brothers\", but the Valley People invade and slaughter the Mountain People. On overturning the stone, they find nothing except the words \"Peace On Earth\" inscribed beneath it.\n\nSinger Jinx Dawson of the band Coven performed the song at a 1971 session with the film's orchestra as part of the soundtrack for the Warner Bros. film \"Billy Jack.\" Dawson asked that her band, Coven, be listed on the recording and film, not her name as a solo artist. This Warner release, titled as \"One Tin Soldier (The Legend of Billy Jack)\", reached number 26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the fall of 1971.\n\nThe full Coven band then re-recorded the song for their self-titled MGM album, which displayed the band members' whited-out faces on the cover, contrived by the film's producer Tom Laughlin. Coven hit the charts again with the song in 1973, in both the new MGM recording and a reissue of their Warner original. The Coven recording was named Number One All Time Requested Song in 1971 and 1973 by the American Radio Broadcasters Association.\n\nA version recorded by Guy Chandler (titled \"One Tin Soldier [The Legend of Billy Jack]\") was released in the summer of 1973.\n\nA version sung by Coven, with a video created by animator John David Wilson was produced for \"The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour\".\n\nRoseanne Barr parodied the song on her 1990 album \"I Enjoy Being a Girl\".\n\nThe song has been covered by other artists, including Mad Parade, Gimp, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Bushman, and Killdozer. Actress Brittany Murphy, in character as Luanne Platter, sang the song on the \"King of the Hill\" soundtrack. This song was also covered by Voices for Peace, a band consisting of a group of voice actors including Greg Ayres and Tiffany Grant. Abigail and Milly Shapiro covered the song for their live album \"Live Out Loud\".\n\nThe progressive bluegrass band The Bluegrass Alliance covered the song at bluegrass festivals in the early 1970s.\n"}

He is remembered today for Goyder's Line of rainfall, a line used in South Australia to demarcate land climatically suitable for arable farming from that suitable only for light grazing, and for the siting, planning and initial development of Darwin, the Northern Territory capital and principal population centre. However, Goyder was an avid researcher into the lands of South Australia (including the present-day Northern Territory) and made recommendations to a great number of settlers in the newly developing colony, especially to those exploiting the newly discovered mineral resources of the state.\n\nGoyder was born in Liverpool, England to Sarah and David George Goyder, the latter a Swedenborgian minister and physician. He moved to Glasgow with his family where he worked with an engineering firm and studied surveying. In 1848, at the age of 22, Goyder followed his sister and brother-in-law, George Galbraith MacLachlan (c. 1842 – 19 March 1873), to Sydney. He spent time working with an auctioneering firm and moved to Adelaide in 1851, obtaining work as a civil service draftsman.\n\nGoyder was appointed Assistant Surveyor-General circa 1856. In this period he made many expeditions into the outback regions of South Australia, thinking that the water in lakes he saw at the time was fresh and permanent, rather than exceedingly erratic. He wrote many letters to newly established pastoralists who had moved into the arid regions for the state's north, and also surveyed the newly establishing mining industry in the Flinders Ranges.\n\nIn 1861 he was appointed Surveyor-General. His early years in the role were very difficult, especially his efforts to help establish settlement in the Northern Territory by supervising the establishment of the pastoral leaseholds that continue to the present day. Pastoralists were hit by a major drought in the middle of the decade and complained severely, with many forced to move even relatives away from their cattle stations by the end of 1865. Goyder was also faced with the despair of his wife, Frances Mary Smith, who suffered the loss of twins at birth during George's long travels in the outback.\n\nGoyder resigned his position as Surveyor-General in 1894, completing a public service career that spanned 41 years.\n\nBefore the drought of the mid-1860s, wheat and barley growing had been spreading rapidly further north and the erroneous belief that rain would \"follow the plow\" led to the idea of cereal crops spreading up to the Northern Territory border.\n\nHowever, the 1864–65 drought put paid, at least temporarily, to these ambitions. Goyder was, in the midst of his work in the pastoral zone, asked to do a report on the problem and his response was to find out how far south crop failure had been general. The northernmost point at which crops had not failed was marked as \"Goyder's Line of Rainfall\" and corresponds approximately to the 300-millimetre (12-inch) annual isohyet (figures vary from 250 to 350 millimetres in different publications).\n\nGoyder recommended that farmers \"not\" attempt to farm cereal crops anywhere north of this line. The idea was quite contrary to beliefs widespread at the time and seen as ridiculous by many people in high places, yet it has been proven to be very wise by the many major droughts in the 140 years since, which have led to major losses by all graingrowers near to, or north of, the line.\n\nGoyder's Line was first accepted significantly after a number of dry years in 1881–1882 and 1884–1886, though improved cultivation practices have allowed some expansion in the 1980s and 1990s, despite a couple of very severe droughts.\n\nGoyder was sent by the government of South Australia, (of which the Territory was then a part) to lay out the street plans for a capital to be named Palmerston. The site was chosen for its exceptionally good water supply, and potential for easy communication with the rest of the continent through land or sea transportation. The site was chosen after Finniss's choice at Escape Cliffs had been rejected.\n\nWith the incentive of a £3,000 bonus, \"Little Energy\" as he was praisingly nicknamed and his team of around 128 men left Port Adelaide on the \"Moonta\" 27 December 1868 and dropped anchor in Darwin Harbour on 5 February 1869. He selected the site on Fort Point near Port Darwin, and nearby townships to be named Daly, Southport and Virginia. They began the work in 1869, completing all four in 18 months. Goyder returned on the \"Gulnare\" to Adelaide in November 1869 with around thirty men, the greater part of his party returning in October 1870, though many (Dr. Robert Peel, George MacLachlan, John Packard, Alfred and Frederick Schultze included) remained to fill positions in the town. Others, including Dan Daly and Paul Foelsche, were to return within a few years.\n\nAmong the 100-odd members of Goyder's expedition were: G. S. Aldridge, J. H. Aldridge, George A. Armstrong, Job Austin, W. Barlow, R. W. Barrow,\nTom Bee, David L. Beetson, J. W. O. Bennett, Michael Bennett, Edwin S. Berry, Henry S. Bosworth, John Sherlock Brooking, Joseph Brooks, Philip H. Burden, William Collett, Daniel Dominick Daly, Henry Edwards, W. Fisher, Paul Foelsche, Michael Francis, J. W. Gepp, John Gerald, Christopher Giles, William Guy, W. Hardy, William Harvey, Richard Hinton, W(illiam) Webster Hoare (assistant to Dr. Peel), W. Holland, Richard A. Horn, Thomas S. Horn, W. Howe, sen., C. N. Greene, George Hughes, George Kersley, S. King, R. R. Knuckey, J. M. Lambell, C. Laycock, J. Loudon, R. J. Loveday, A. L. McKay, George MacLachlan, Gilbert R. McMinn, A. E. Millaw, C. Miller, W. W. Mills, A. J. Mitchell, W. Charles Musgrave, H. Nottage, H. D. Packard, John H. Packard, Dr. R. Peel, G. Richards, J. Le M. F. Roberts, W. Rowe, Alfred Schultze, Frederick Schultze, A. H. Smith, E. M. Smith, C. Spencely, C. W. Sprigg, A. J. Thomas, J. M. Thomas, Charles Frederick Wells, and A. T. Woods, Ned & John Ryan (SA Govt Surveyors), most of whom are commemorated in the names of Darwin streets and outlying localities.\n\nThe Overland Telegraph was landed there from England (via present-day Indonesia) soon afterwards, and commenced operation in 1872. In 1911 Palmerston was renamed Darwin, but the name Palmerston was resurrected around 1980 for Darwin's satellite city to the south.\n\nHe married Frances Mary Smith on 10 December 1851 at Christ Church, North Adelaide, and had nine children with her. Frances died on 8 April 1870 and George married her sister Ellen Priscilla Smith, who had been looking after the children, on 20 November 1871. With Ellen, George had three children, a son and twin daughters. Goyder led an austere and disciplined life, and this was reflected in his strict treatment of subordinates – though he was always regarded as fair to those he advised in spite of many complaints by farmers and graziers. By the late 1880s, however, Goyder's health was declining and, with no improvement in sight, he resigned the post of Surveyor-General at the end of 1893. He died at his home \"Warrakilla\", at Mylor near Aldgate in the Adelaide Hills on 2 November 1898 and was buried in the Stirling District Cemetery.\n\nGoyder Road in Darwin is named for him, and many others of the party are similarly honoured. Also named for him are a large river in Arnhem Land and electorates in both the Northern Territory and South Australia. Mount Woodroffe, the highest peak in South Australia at is named after him (George Woodroffe Goyder)\n\nGoyder's name has also been given to a species of grasswren \"Amytornis goyderi\" (Gould 1875), a district council, an electorate, the new pavilion at the Royal Adelaide Showgrounds, several streets, a park and the Goyder Institute for Water Research.\n\n\nand of course Goyder's Line of rainfall\n\n\n"}
