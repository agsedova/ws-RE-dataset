{"id": "1974769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974769", "title": "Behavioral sink", "text": "Behavioral sink\n\n\"Behavioral sink\" is a term invented by ethologist John B. Calhoun to describe a collapse in behavior which can result from overcrowding. The term and concept derive from a series of over-population experiments Calhoun conducted on Norway rats between 1958 and 1962.\nIn the experiments, Calhoun and his researchers created a series of \"rat utopias\" - enclosed spaces in which rats were given unlimited access to food and water, enabling unfettered population growth. Calhoun coined the term \"behavioral sink\" in his February 1, 1962 report in an article titled \"Population Density and Social Pathology\" in \"Scientific American\" on the rat experiment.\nHe would later perform similar experiments on mice, from 1968 to 1972.\n\nCalhoun's work became used as an animal model of societal collapse, and his study has become a touchstone of urban sociology and psychology in general.\n\nIn the 1962 study, Calhoun described the behavior as follows:\n\nCalhoun retired from NIMH in 1984, but continued to work on his research results until his death on September 7, 1995.\n\nCalhoun's early experiments with rats were carried out on farmland at Rockville, Maryland, starting in 1947.\n\nWhile Calhoun was working at NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) in 1954, he began numerous experiments with rats and mice. During his first tests, he placed around 32 to 56 rodents in a 10 x 14-foot case in a barn in Montgomery County. He separated the space into four rooms. Every room was specifically created to support a dozen matured brown Norwegian rats. Rats could maneuver between the rooms by using the ramps. Since Calhoun provided unlimited resources, such as water, food, and also protection from predators as well as from disease and weather, the rats were said to be in \"rat utopia\" or \"mouse paradise\", another psychologist explained.\n\nFollowing his earlier experiments with rats, in 1972 Calhoun would later create his \"Mortality-Inhibiting Environment for Mice\": a 101-inch square cage for mice with food and water replenished to support any increase in population, which took his experimental approach to its limits. In his most famous experiment in the series, \"Universe 25\", population peaked at 2,200 mice and thereafter exhibited a variety of abnormal, often destructive behaviors. By the 600th day, the population was on its way to extinction.\n\nThe 1962 \"Scientific American\" article came at a time at which overpopulation had become a subject of great public interest, and had a considerable cultural influence. The study was directly referenced in some works of fiction, and may have been an influence on many more.\n\nCalhoun had phrased much of his work in anthropomorphic terms, in a way that made his ideas highly accessible to a lay audience. Tom Wolfe wrote about the concept in his article \"Oh Rotten Gotham! Sliding Down into the Behavioral Sink\", later to be made into the last chapter of \"The Pump House Gang\". Lewis Mumford also referenced Calhoun's work in his \"The City in History\", stating:\n\nCalhoun's work has been referenced in comic books, including \"Batman\" and \"2000 AD\".\n\nCalhoun himself saw the fate of the population of mice as a metaphor for the potential fate of man. He characterized the social breakdown as a \"spiritual death\", with reference to bodily death as the \"second death\" mentioned in the Biblical book of .\n\nCalhoun's work with rats inspired the 1971 children's book, \"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\", by Robert C. O'Brien, which was adapted into a 1982 animated film, \"The Secret of NIMH\".\n\nControversy exists over the implications of the experiment. Psychologist Jonathan Freedman's experiment recruited high school and university students to carry out a series of experiments that measured the effects of density on behavior. He measured their stress, discomfort, aggression, competitiveness, and general unpleasantness. He declared to have found no appreciable negative effects in 1975. Researchers argued that \"Calhoun's work was not simply about density in a physical sense, as number of individuals-per-square-unit-area, but was about degrees of social interaction.\"\n\n"}

It is distributed globally, reaching over 310 million homes worldwide. It is headquartered in New York City, with European headquarters in London and Asian headquarters in Hong Kong.\n\nMost of the channels listed are not directly operated by Bloomberg, but are operated by local companies who franchise the Bloomberg brand and may take some of its English-language programming.\n\n\n\nBloomberg's U.S. broadcasts are headed by Justin Smith, the CEO of Bloomberg Media Group. Smith replaced Andy Lack, who eventually returned to NBC News. The network also provided funding and studio facilities for the nightly PBS/WNET program \"Charlie Rose\".\n\nBloomberg Television first launched in the United States on January 1, 1994 under the name Bloomberg Information TV, before it was shortened to its current name in 1998. Shortly after Bloomberg's launch, the now-defunct American Independent Network carried a simulcast of the channel at various times each weekday from 1995 to 1997, which was picked up by some broadcast stations in early morning periods to provide a \"de facto\" morning business show. The network's morning pre-opening bell programming was also aired on the USA Network, simulcasted in a paid programming arrangement with the channel until 2004, when that network dropped the simulcast months before the NBC Universal merger was consummated, due to concerns that USA would then air the coverage of a competitor to future sister network CNBC. The simulcast then moved to E! (which became NBCUniversal-owned in January 2011 due to that company's purchase by Comcast), where it remained until the simulcast ended in January 2009, when the network had expanded its reach on digital cable systems enough to discontinue the simulcast. During its time on E!, the 5–8 a.m. block was the most watched period for the network, according to Nielsen Media Research.\n\nBloomberg Television's U.S. network debuted a new graphics package in January 2009. This current scheme was first used on the network's now-defunct pre-market program, \"Starting Bell\", before the new graphics expanded to all of the network's programs on February 17, 2009. Also on that date, Bloomberg U.S. revamped its weekday programming lineup (see \"Programs on Bloomberg\" below).\n\nIn October 2009, Bloomberg Television debuted another new graphics package. In 2011, Bloomberg Television announced a strategic relationship with Gas Station TV (GSTV) to deliver personal finance and business news to more than 27 million viewers each month at GSTV pumps.\n\nBloomberg launched a high definition simulcast feed on May 9, 2011, with Time Warner Cable as the first provider to carry it. In mid-April 2013, DIRECTV started carrying Bloomberg HD.\n\nAs of July 2014, Bloomberg Television's standard-definition feed now shows a down-scaled version of its native HD feed, with the 16:9 letterbox picture on its 4:3 SD feed.\n\nIn February 2009, Bloomberg Television announced that it would cease operating some of the international variations of the channel, placing a greater focus on a more international Bloomberg channel.\n\nOn March 9, 2009, the localized channels available in Germany, France, Italy and Spain ceased operations. Today, throughout Europe, the original pan-European version of Bloomberg Europe (International) is available on cable and digital television providers.\n\nSince March 9, 2009, Bloomberg Television utilizes its existing international production teams in Hong Kong (Bloomberg Asia), Europe (Bloomberg Europe) and America (Bloomberg), adding a more global feel to the channel. Bloomberg International provides programming from Hong Kong in the early morning, produced by Bloomberg Asia (International), from London in the late morning, produced by Bloomberg Europe (International), and from its main headquarters in New York City in the afternoon. Each Bloomberg receives localized advertising and a relevant business news ticker on screen.\n\nBloomberg Japan ceased broadcasting on April 30, 2009. The channel was then replaced by Bloomberg Asia (International). Bloomberg Japan's Japanese language print newsroom and website continue to operate as normal. In June 2009, the Japanese service began running small on-air segments in cooperation with BS-Fuji Television. In October 2009, segments produced with the Tokyo Broadcasting System were added. Bloomberg Brazil and Bloomberg Latin America were integrated into the global Bloomberg channel during 2009.\n\nBloomberg is an associate member of the Caribbean Cable & Telecommunications Association and the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.\n\nIn November 2011, Bloomberg announced the formation of \"Bloomberg TV Mongolia\" in partnership with Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia (TDB), the oldest and one of the largest commercial banks in Mongolia. The channel offers a mix of locally produced, Mongolian language content as well as English language news from Bloomberg Television.\n\nIn February 2015, Bloomberg partnered with Canadian media company Channel Zero to form Bloomberg TV Canada, which featured U.S. Bloomberg Television programming and Canadian-produced studio programs produced from Bloomberg's Brookfield Place studio and other Canadian bureaus. The channel replaced the U.S. service on Canadian television providers. The channel shut down in October 2017, after which Bloomberg entered into a partnership with Bell Media's Business News Network (BNN), to co-brand the channel as BNN Bloomberg, and grant the company rights to distribute its television and radio content in Canada. The co-branded service will augment BNN's existing business day programming with additional Bloomberg programs to handle coverage of international markets, and access to its bureaus.\n\nLive weekday shows\n\nWeekday schedule begins Sunday 6pm (ET), 11pm (UK), Monday 12am (CET) and 6am (HK). Weekend schedule begins on Friday/Saturday at the same times.\n\nWeekly shows\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Bloomberg Television was severely reprimanded for breach of Ofcom rules during the 2005 UK national (General) election. Bloomberg was found to have shown pro-Labour Party bias. This occurred because of a breach of British law. In the run up to a general election, television channels must provide equal time to all major political parties. Bloomberg covered the release by the Labour Party of their so-called \"Business Manifesto\", but did not provide counterbalancing air time to the Conservatives or Liberal Democrats.\n\nBloomberg was well known for using a datascreen format that occupied most of the television screen and the camera shots. Until 1998, Bloomberg did not have a moving ticker. Instead, it had boxes that were dedicated to world news, as well as weather conditions in selected cities, in addition to market data which was confined to the bottom of the screen. This changed gradually to focus more on business news. The data screen was reformatted several times to include a moving stock ticker and accommodate new graphics.\n\nThe datascreen format was phased out in late 2007, where the programs were seen almost in full-screen with the ticker and headlines bar confined to the lower part of the screen. However, Bloomberg HD (available in the US only) features more data boxes on the right side of the screen compared to its SD counterpart. This effectively makes on-screen presentation on Bloomberg HD resemble the pre-2007 datascreen.\n\nOn Monday September 22, 2014, Bloomberg Television dropped the long-standing live stock ticker as part of the new on screen information format. No reason for this was given.\n\nThe widespread growth of mobile devices and social media have influenced sites such as Bloomberg to expand its news platforms into other areas. Bloomberg Television offers some off-air news updates via social media including Facebook, and Twitter. Rebroadcasts of news and other special programs are additionally aired on the station's official YouTube channel \"Bloomberg Television\". On mobile devices, Bloomberg Television released an app available for the iPad. Apple TV. It is also available for free viewing on Pluto TV streaming service.\n\nAs of February 2019, the audio simulcast of Bloomberg TV is distributed on Entercom's Radio.com website and app.\n\n\n"}

At this time, the conference expanded its membership to include Springfield College and the United States Coast Guard Academy.\n\nThe NEW 8 began play in 1985-86 as the New England Women's 6 Conference (NEW 6). Charter members were Babson College, Brandeis University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Smith College, Wellesley College and Wheaton College. Mount Holyoke College and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) joined in 1988 and the name was changed to the NEW 8 Conference. At the conclusion of the 1994-95 academic year, Brandeis University withdrew from the NEW 8 to join the University Athletic Association (which its men's sports competed at that time) and Clark University accepted membership, keeping the NEW 8's membership at eight institutions.\n\nIn March of 2012, the NEWMAC announced the addition of Emerson College as the 11th full member of the league starting in the 2013-14 academic year.

{"id": "1974793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974793", "title": "Big Number Change", "text": "Big Number Change\n\nThe Big Number Change addressed various issues with the telephone dialling plan in the United Kingdom, during the late-1990s and early-2000s.\n\nThe first was an update to a small number of geographic dialling codes in response to the rapid late-1990s growth of telecommunications and impending exhaustion of local numbers in several cities. The change greatly expanded the pool of available numbers within those places while retaining 'local dialling' (the ability to dial local numbers directly, without needing to dial an area code first). The change affected the dialling codes assigned to Cardiff, Coventry, London, Northern Ireland, Portsmouth and Southampton, culminating in a large switch on 22 April 2000. All of these places moved to eight-digit local numbers ensuring sufficient local capacity for many decades (London saw a five-fold increase in capacity, for example). No other geographic area codes were affected.\n\nThe other set of changes affected mobile, non-geographic and premium rate numbers, completing a series of steps first detailed almost a decade earlier. In the early-1990s, mobile, non-geographic and premium rate services had used nine digit numbers with various codes such as 0402, 0645, and 0898 scattered among the similar-looking geographic area codes such as 0384, 0562 and 0949. The number of available codes for new services was quickly dwindling. In 1995, PhONEday partially addressed this by altering all geographic area codes to begin 01, freeing up hundreds of codes beginning 02 to 09 for other uses. Existing mobile, non-geographic and premium rate services continued as before, using various codes from 02 to 09 and with nine-digit numbers.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, mobile, non-geographic and premium rate numbers started to be issued with ten digits and using only specific new prefixes: 070 for personal numbers, 076 for pagers, 077xx, 078xx and 079xx for mobiles, 0800 and 0808 for freephone, 0845 and 0870 for non-geographic revenue-share numbers and 090x for premium rate numbers. Within each of these groups some smaller number blocks were held aside for the older 9-digit mobile, non-geographic and premium rate services to move into at a later date. In 2000 and 2001, the Big Number Change put those final parts into place and they are detailed below.\n\nAt the end of the process, there were no numbers in the UK beginning 03, 04 or 06. Additionally, the 02, 05, 07, 08 and 09 ranges were only lightly used. With PhONEday in 1995 and the Big Number Change, the UK had achieved huge spare capacity for new services and simple to understand prefix groupings: 01 and 02 for geographic numbers, 070 for personal numbers, 076 for pagers, 07624, 077, 078 and 079 for mobiles, 0500 and 080 for freephone, 084 and 087 for non-geographic and 090 for premium rate. Further new allocations would initially conform only to those groupings. Over the following decade, the 030, 033, 034, 037, 055, 056, 074, 075, 091 and 098 ranges would also come into use for new services or for further expansion of old services.\n\nThese changes set the following areas to use 02 area codes and eight-digit subscriber numbers.\nNote Under the change, the two London areas were reunified under the single (020) code. New numbers beginning with 7, 8 or (later) 3 were allocated regardless of location.\n\nAll of the above areas now have an eight-digit local number, in place of their previous six or seven-digit local number. For a short while, you could use either number for local dialling, but local access to the old, shorter numbers was switched off after a few months of parallel running.\n\nWithin London, new 70xx xxxx, 71xx xxxx, 80xx xxxx and 81xx xxxx numbers became available for general use. These began to be allocated anywhere in London, with no regard for the 1990-2000 inner/outer London geographical split.\n\nIn all of the other areas, new BC0x xxxx and BC1x xxxx numbers became available for general use at the same time (where 'BC' stands for '76' in Coventry, '20' in Cardiff, etc.).\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the situation was more complicated. While the primary reason for the changes was the lack of numbering capacity in Belfast (01232), this was not the only reason. When STD codes were introduced in the 1950s, Northern Ireland was allocated only 14 area codes for 34 charging groups. Normal practice in Great Britain was to allocate one area code per charging group but, as calls to Northern Ireland were national rate from anywhere in GB, it was not seen to be necessary to differentiate between all of them. So, area codes covering multiple charge groups (\"mixed\" areas) were created; in practice this meant that some areas had longer area codes. For example, while Enniskillen was allocated the area code 0365 (0EK5), Kesh was allocated 03656 and Lisnaskea 03657. As a result, numbers in Enniskillen could not begin with 6 or 7, as this would conflict with those of Kesh or Lisnaskea.\n\nAll this meant that while Enniskillen's numbers could be six digits long, Kesh's and Lisnaskea's (and those of other dependent exchanges) could only be five digits, due to the 9-digit limit of the length of a phone number at the time. This severely restricted capacity in these areas. As a result, at the Big Number Change, all these dependent exchanges were migrated to different numbers than their parent exchanges; in this instance while Enniskillen's 01365 (the 1 coming from PhONEday) was migrated to 028 66, Kesh went from 013656 to 028 686 and Lisnaskea from 013657 to 028 677. This meant that Kesh could expand into the rest of the 028 68xx range.\n\nNote that the new numbering scheme groups numbers together such that the first digit identifies the county in alphabetical order. The exception is the Greater Belfast area where all numbers begin with 9, regardless of the county. The full list of changes for Northern Ireland is as in the table above.\n\nIn London, old National Dialling Only 0xx xxxx and 1xx xxxx numbers were migrated to new 0axx xxxx and 1axx xxxx numbers (where 'a' is mostly 0 or 1, so far).\n\nIn all of the other areas, old National Dialling Only 0xxxxx and 1xxxxx numbers were migrated to new 0aax xxxx and 1aax xxxx numbers.\n\nThe migration from old to new numbers was as follows:\nThe following changes were made to non-geographic numbering ranges to bring them in the 08xx special services range.\n\nThe 0500 (Mercury FreeCall) code remained in use after The Big Number Change, but no new numbers were allocated after 28 April 2001. The 0500 range was eventually ceased on 3 June 2017, with numbers transferred to 0808 5xx xxxx equivalents during a three year transition period prior to that date.\n\nThe 0800 (BT Freefone) code has remained, but no new nine digit numbers have been allocated since 1997. Instead, all 0800 numbers issued since that time have ten digits after the leading 0 or +44.\n\nThe following changes were made to non-geographic numbering ranges to bring them in the 090x premium rate range.\nPersonal numbers moved to the 070 range.\nThe following changes were made to mobile phone numbering ranges to bring them in the 07xxx mobile numbers range.\nThe following codes for pager numbers were also changed, so that all are in the 076 range:\n\nNon-standard pager prefixes beginning 01 were moved to their new 076 allocation.\n\nSome of these codes, as indicated by the arrow \"→\", had already been changed during PhONEday to add a \"1\" after the initial zero, and now they have been changed again.\n\nThese fictional numbers were originally made available by Oftel for dramatic purposes, for example for quoting in TV, radio and film. Ofcom revised the list some years after the Big Number Change and explains: \"\"Telephone Numbers recommended for drama purposes cannot be allocated to Communications Providers for their customers because of the potential influx of calls that customers may receive should their Telephone Numbers be shown in a drama.\"\"\n\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Number range type\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Code area\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before PhONEday\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before BNC\n! colspan=\"2\" | After BNC\n! scope=\"col\" | Code\n! scope=\"col\" | Number range\n! scope=\"col\" | Code\n! scope=\"col\" | Number range\n! scope=\"col\" | Code\n! scope=\"col\" | Number range\n"}

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten and the Nippon Television Network. \"Ocean Waves\" first aired on May 5, 1993 on Nippon TV.\n\nThe film is set in the city of Kōchi, on the Japanese island of Shikoku. It concerns a love triangle that develops between two good friends and a new girl who transfers to their high school from Tokyo.\n\n\"Ocean Waves\" was an attempt by Studio Ghibli to allow their younger staff members to make a film reasonably cheaply. However, it ended up going both over budget and over schedule.\n\nIn December 2016, GKIDS announced that the film would be remastered for a limited theatrical release, beginning on December 28, 2016, with a home video release in Spring 2017.\n\nAt Kichijōji Station, Tokyo, Taku Morisaki glimpses a familiar woman on the platform opposite. Later, as his flight to Kōchi Prefecture takes off, he narrates the events that brought her into his life. The story is told in flashback.\n\nIn Kōchi, two years prior, Taku receives a call from his friend, Yutaka Matsuno, asking to meet at their high school. He finds Yutaka at a window, watching an attractive female transfer student whom Yutaka was asked to show around. The boys discuss their upcoming school trip to Hawaii. At the school gates, Taku is introduced to the new girl, Rikako Muto. She thanks Yutaka for providing directions to a bookstore. Taku teases Yutaka about his infatuation.\n\nRikako is academically gifted and good at sports, but also arrogant. Taku believes she is unhappy about leaving Tokyo. His mother learns from gossip that a divorce brought Rikako's mother to Kōchi. In a phone conversation with Yutaka, he discovers that Rikako is living away from the family house.\n\nThe school year ends, heralding the Hawaii trip. Taku, suffering from an upset stomach, is stopped in the hotel lobby by Rikako. She explains that she has lost her money and asks to borrow some. As Taku has a part-time job, he lends her ¥60,000. Promising to repay him, she warns not to tell anyone. As she departs, Taku sees a stern Yutaka and feels compelled to explain. Later, Rikako admonishes him for telling Yutaka about the money, saying that he also loaned her ¥20,000.\n\nBack in Kōchi, the third year begins with Rikako making a friend, Yumi Kohama. Rikako hasn't returned Taku's money and he wonders if she has forgotten. Out of the blue, a distressed Yumi calls Taku, explaining that Rikako had tricked her into coming to the airport on the pretence of a concert trip, only to discover that their real destination is Tokyo, tickets paid for with Taku's money. He races to the airport, sending Yumi home, saying that he will accompany Rikako.\n\nUpon arrival, it appears that Rikako has not forewarned her father, interrupting his planned trip with a girlfriend. Her father thanks Taku, repays the loan and arranges a room at the Hyatt Regency hotel. Later, Rikako explains that when her parents were fighting, she'd always sided with her father, but had now discovered he wasn't on her side. Comforting her, Taku offers his bed and attempts to sleep in the bathtub. The next morning, Rikako seems back to her normal self and kicks Taku out so that she can change clothes to meet a friend for lunch. Taku wanders around the city. After catching up on sleep at the hotel, Taku receives a call from Rikako asking to be rescued from former boyfriend, Okada, who is not as she remembered him.\n\nReturning home, Rikako ignores Taku, but doesn't hide from others that they spent a night together. Taku discovers this from Yutaka, who had earlier confronted Rikako to confess his feelings toward her, but had been rebuffed. Taku confronts Rikako in class for hurting his best friend, calling her \"\"The worst!\"\". She responds by slapping him and he slaps her in return.\n\nThe autumn school cultural festival arrives and Rikako, who has been avoiding Yosakoi dance rehearsals, becomes more distant from the other girls, many of whom openly dislike her. Confronting her behind the school, Rikako stands firm as one girl, believing that Rikako was flirting with her boyfriend, attempts to strike her but is held back. Taku, who has seen all, approaches Rikako and comments that he is impressed with the way she handled herself. She slaps him but runs away with regret. Yutaka confronts a somewhat stunned Taku, who tries to explain. Yutaka punches him to the ground calling him an idiot before walking away. None of the three talk to each other for the rest of the year.\n\nIn the present, Taku's plane lands and he is offered a lift home by Yutaka, who explains he punched him because he'd realized Taku had held back his feelings for his sake. At a class reunion, former student president Shimizu mentions she had met Rikako earlier. She explains that as Rikako was attending Kochi University, she had flown to Tokyo for her school break, missing the reunion. Taku realizes that Rikako was the woman he'd seen at the station. Walking home, Yumi tells Taku that she too had met Rikako, explaining she couldn't make it to the reunion and that she wanted to meet someone, but wouldn't say who... just that he slept in bathtubs.\n\nIn Tokyo, Taku again sees Rikako across the platforms, but this time runs to find her. As the train pulls away, he finds Rikako and realises that he had always been in love with her.\n\n\n\n\nThe film is based on Himuro's novel which was first serialized, with illustrations by Katsuya Kondō, starting from the February 1990 issue of \"Animage\" magazine. The monthly instalments were collected in a hard cover book published in February 1993. Kondō served as the character designer and animation director for the adaptation. Production of \"Ocean Waves\" was controlled by Studio Ghibli, but much of the animation was produced with the assistance of J.C.Staff, Madhouse Studios, and Oh! Production, who had worked with Ghibli on past projects. This film is the first Ghibli anime directed by someone other than Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Tomomi Mochizuki, who was 34 years old at the time, was brought in to direct. The film was an attempt to make anime solely by the young staff members, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Their motto was to produce \"quickly, cheaply and with quality\", but ultimately it went over budget and over schedule and Mochizuki claimed he developed Peptic ulcer because of stress.\n\nThe website Animé Café gave the film 4/5 stars, noting this to be \"A graceful and mature offering from Ghibli's younger generation\".\n\nOtaku USA gave the film a mediocre review.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 88%, based on 16 critical reviews, with an average score of 6/10.

It opened in 1873 on a site. It has been described as the \"Rolls Royce\" of London's Jewish cemeteries and is designated Grade II on Historic England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In 2015 it was awarded a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to restore some key features of the cemetery and to create a visitor centre, a permanent exhibition and a web-based education project.\n\nThe cemetery, developed on ground purchased from All Souls College, Oxford, was opened in 1873, three years after the United Synagogue was established by Act of Parliament. It was expanded in 1890, in 1906 and between 1925 and 1926. The cemetery and its funerary buildings, in English Gothic style, were designed by the architect Nathan Solomon Joseph (1834–1909). In 2017 Historic England listed the cemetery at Grade II on the grounds of: its being the first venture of the United Synagogue; its having associations with many influential families and individuals who are buried there; its overall design by a prominent Jewish architect; \"the quality, opulence and variety displayed by the monuments as a group, reflecting both Jewish traditions and English influences\"; and its survival – \"the Old Cemetery remains intact, whilst the subsequent evolution of the cemetery is well-documented and legible\".\n\nThe cemetery, which has 29,800 graves, has many significant memorials and monuments. Four of them are listed at Grade II.\n\nThe cemetery has 33 Commonwealth service war graves from World War I, six of which form a small group by the Assembly Hall, and 77 from World War II, 22 of them grouped in a war graves plot. These include the grave of Dudley Joel (1904–1941), businessman and Conservative Party politician, who died in World War II. In place of a Cross of Sacrifice, a memorial designed by Ralph Hobday in the form of an obelisk was placed in 1961 by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission opposite the World War II war graves plot.

{"id": "1974810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974810", "title": "Taste (sociology)", "text": "Taste (sociology)\n\nIn sociology, taste is an individual's personal, cultural and aesthetic patterns of choice and preference. Taste is drawing distinctions between things such as styles, manners, consumer goods, and works of art and relating to these. Social inquiry of taste is about the human ability to judge what is beautiful, good, and proper.\n\nSocial and cultural phenomena concerning taste are closely associated to social relations and dynamics between people. The concept of social taste is therefore rarely separated from its accompanying sociological concepts. An understanding of taste as something that is expressed in actions between people helps to perceive many social phenomena that would otherwise be inconceivable.\n\nAesthetic preferences and attendance to various cultural events are associated with education and social origin. Different socioeconomic groups are likely to have different tastes. Social class is one of the prominent factors structuring taste.\n\nThe concept of aesthetics has been the interest of philosophers such as Plato, Hume and Kant, who understood aesthetics as something pure and searched the essence of beauty, or, \"the ontology of aesthetics\". But it was not before the beginning of the cultural sociology of early 19th century that the question was problematized in its social context, which took the differences and changes in historical view as an important process of aesthetical thought. Although Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Judgement\" (1790) did formulate a non-relativistic idea of aesthetical universality, where both personal pleasure and pure beauty coexisted, it was concepts such as class taste that began the attempt to find essentially sociological answers to the problem of taste and aesthetics. Metaphysical or spiritual interpretations of common aesthetical values have shifted towards locating social groups that form the contemporary artistic taste or fashion.\nIn his aesthetic philosophy, Kant denies any standard of a good taste, which would be the taste of the majority or any social group. For Kant, as discussed in his book titled the \"Critique of Judgment\", beauty is not a property of any object, but an aesthetic judgement based on a subjective feeling. He claims that a genuine good taste does exist, though it could not be empirically identified. Good taste cannot be found in any standards or generalizations, and the validity of a judgement is not the general view of the majority or some specific social group. Taste is both personal and beyond reasoning, and therefore disputing over matters of taste never reaches any universality. Kant stresses that our preferences, even on generally liked things, do not justify our judgements.\n\nEvery judgement of taste, according to Kant, presumes the existence of a \"sensus communis\", a consensus of taste. This non-existent consensus is an idea that both enables judgements of taste and is constituted by a somewhat conceptual cultivation of taste. A judgement does not take for granted that everyone agrees with it, but it proposes the community to share the experience. If the statement would not be addressed to this community, it is not a genuine subjective judgement. Kant's idea of good taste excludes fashion, which can be understood only in its empirical form, and has no connection with the harmony of ideal consensus. There is a proposition of a universal communal voice in judgements of taste, which calls for a shared feeling among the others.\n\nBourdieu argued against Kantian view of pure aesthetics, stating that the legitimate taste of the society is the taste of the ruling class. This position also rejects the idea of genuine good taste, as the legitimate taste is merely a class taste. This idea was also proposed by Simmel, who noted that the upper classes abandon fashions as they are adopted by lower ones.\n\nFashion in a Kantian sense is an aesthetic phenomenon and source of pleasure. For Kant, the function of fashion was merely a means of social distinction, and he excluded fashion from pure aesthetics because of its content's arbitrary nature. Simmel, following Kantian thought, recognises the usefulness of fashionable objects in its social context. For him, the function lies in the whole fashion pattern, and cannot be attributed to any single object. Fashion, for Simmel, is a tool of individuation, social distinction, and even class distinction, which are neither utilitarian or aesthetical criteria. Still, both Kant and Simmel agreed that staying out of fashion would be pointless.\n\nTaste and consumption are closely linked together; taste as a preference of certain types of clothing, food and other commodities directly affects the consumer choices at the market. The causal link between taste and consumption is however more complicated than a direct chain of events in which taste creates demand that, in turn, creates supply. There are many scientific approaches to taste, specifically within the fields of economics, psychology and sociology.\n\nDefinition of consumption in its classical economical context can be summed up in the saying \"supply creates its own demand\". In other words, consumption is created by and equates itself to production of market goods. This definition, however, is not adequate to accommodate any theory that tries to describe the link between taste and consumption.\n\nA more complex economic model for taste and consumption was proposed by economist Thorstein Veblen. He challenged the simple conception of man as plain consumer of his utmost necessities, and suggested that the study of the formation of tastes and consumption patterns was essential for economics. Veblen did not disregard the importance of the demand for an economic system, but rather insisted on rejection of the principle of utility-maximization. The classical economics conception of supply and demand must be therefore extended to accommodate a type of social interaction that is not immanent in the economics paradigm.\n\nVeblen understood man as a creature with a strong instinct to emulate others to survive. As social status is in many cases at least partially based on or represented by one's property, men tend to try and match their acquisitions with those who are higher in a social hierarchy. In terms of taste and modern consumption this means that taste forms in a process of emulation: people emulate each other, which creates certain habits and preferences, which in turn contributes to consumption of certain preferred goods.\n\nVeblen's main argument concerned what he called \"leisure class\", and it explicates the mechanism between taste, acquisition and consumption. He took his thesis of taste as an economic factor and merged it with the neoclassical hypothesis of nonsatiety, which states that no man can ever be satisfied with his fortune. Hence, those who can afford luxuries are bound to be in a better social situation than others, because acquisition of luxuries by definition grants a good social status. This creates a demand for certain leisure goods, that are not necessities, but that, because of the current taste of the most well off, become wanted commodities.\n\nIn different periods of time, consumption and its societal functions have varied. In 14th century England consumption had significant political element. By creating an expensive luxurious aristocratic taste the Monarchy could legitimize itself in high status, and, according to the mechanism of taste and consumption, by mimicking the taste of the Royal the nobility competed for high social position. The aristocratic scheme of consumption came to an end, when industrialization made the rotation of commodities faster and prices lower, and the luxuries of the previous times became less and less indicator of social status. As production and consumption of commodities became a scale bigger, people could afford to choose from different commodities. This provided for fashion to be created in market.\n\nThe era of mass consumption marks yet another new kind of consumption and taste pattern. Beginning from the 18th century, this period can be characterized by increase in consumption and birth of fashion, that cannot be accurately explained only by social status. More than establishing their class, people acquired goods just to consume hedonistically. This means, that the consumer is never satisfied, but constantly seeks out novelties and tries to satisfy insatiable urge to consume.\n\nIn above taste has been seen as something that presupposes consumption, as something that exists before consumer choices. In other words, taste is seen as an attribute or property of a consumer or a social group. Alternative view critical to the attributative taste suggests that taste doesn't exist in itself as an attribute or a property, but instead is an activity in itself. This kind of pragmatic conception of taste derives its critical momentum from the fact that individual tastes can not be observed in themselves, but rather that only physical acts can. Building on Hennion, Arsel and Bean suggest a practice-theory approach to understanding taste.\n\nConsumption, especially mass consumerism has been criticized from various philosophical, cultural and political directions. Consumption has been described as overly conspicuous or environmentally untenable, and also a sign of bad taste.\n\nMany critics have voiced their opinion against the growing influence of mass culture, fearing the decline in global divergence of culture. For example, it is claimed that the convenience of getting the same hamburger at fast food places like McDonald's can reduce consumer interest in traditional culinary experiences.\n\nThe Western culture of consumerism has been criticized for its uniformity. The critics argue, that while the culture industry promises consumers new experiences and adventures, people in fact are fed the same pattern of swift but temporary fulfillment. Here taste, it is suggested, is used as a means of repression; as something that is given from above, or from the industry of the mass culture, to people who are devoid of contentual and extensive ideologies and of will. This critique insists that the popular Western culture does not fill people with aesthetic and cultural satisfaction.\n\nArguably, the question of taste is in many ways related to the underlying social divisions of community. There is likely to be variation between groups of different socioeconomic status in preferences for cultural practices and goods, to the extent that it is often possible to identify particular types of class taste. Also, within many theories concerning taste, class dynamics is understood as one of the principal mechanisms structuring taste and the ideas of sophistication and vulgarity.\n\nSociologists suggest that people disclose much about their positions in social hierarchies by how their everyday choices reveal their tastes. That is preference for certain consumer goods, appearances, manners etc. may signal status because it is perceived as part of the lifestyle of high-status groups. But, it is further argued, not just that patterns of taste are determined by class structure. because people may also strategically employ distinctions of taste as resources in maintaining and redefining their social status.\n\nWhen taste is explained on account of its functions for status competition, interpretations are often built on the model of social emulation. It is assumed, firstly, that people desire to distinguish themselves from those with lower status in the social hierarchy and, secondly, that people will imitate those in higher positions.\n\nThe German sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918) examined the phenomenon of fashion - as manifested in rapidly changing patterns of taste. According to Simmel, fashion is a vehicle for strengthening the unity of the social classes and for making them distinct. Members of the upper classes tend to signal their superiority, and they act as the initiators of new trends. But upper-class taste is soon imitated by the middle classes. As goods, appearances, manners etc. conceived as high-class status markers become popular enough, they lose their function to differentiate. So the upper classes have to originate yet more stylistic innovations.\n\nThe particular taste of the upper classes has been further analyzed by an economist Thorsten Veblen (1857–1929). He argues that distancing oneself from hardships of productive labour has always been the conclusive sign of high social status. Hence, upper-class taste is not defined by things regarded as necessary or useful but by those that are the opposite. To demonstrate non-productivity, members of the so-called leisure class waste conspicuously both time and goods. The lower social stratum try their best to imitate the non-productive lifestyle of the upper classes, even though they do not really have means for catching up.\n\nOne of the most widely referenced theories of class-based tastes was coined by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002), who asserted that tastes of social classes are structured on basis of assessments concerning possibilities and constraints of social action. Some choices are not equally possible for everyone. The constraints are not simply because members of different classes have varying amounts of economic resources at their disposal. Bourdieu argued that there are also significant non-economic resources and their distribution effects social stratification and inequality. One such resource is cultural capital, which is acquired mainly through education and social origin. It consists of accumulated knowledge and competence for making cultural distinctions. To possess cultural capital is a potential advantage for social action, providing access to education credentials, occupations and social affiliation.\n\nBy assessing relationships between consumption patterns and the distribution of economic and cultural capital, Bourdieu identified distinct class tastes within French society of the 1960s. Upper-class taste is characterized by refined and subtle distinctions, and it places intrinsic value on aesthetic experience. This particular kind of taste was appreciated as the legitimate basis for \"good taste\" in French society, acknowledged by the other classes as well. Consequently, members of the middle classes appeared to practice \"cultural goodwill\" in emulating the high-class manners and lifestyles. The taste of the middle classes is not defined as much by authentic appreciation for aesthetics as by a desire to compete in social status. In contrast, the popular taste of the working classes is defined by an imperative for \"choosing the necessary\". Not much importance is placed on aesthetics. This may be because of actual material deprivation excluding anything but the necessary but, also, because of a habit, formed by collective class experiences.\nClass related tastes become manifest in different cultural domains such as food, clothing, arts, humor, and even religion.\n\nTheories of taste which build on the ideas of status competition and social emulation have been criticized from various standpoints. Firstly, it has been suggested that it is not reasonable to trace all social action back to status competition. That is while marking and claiming status are strong incentives, people also have other motivations as well. Secondly, it has been argued that it not plausible to assume that tastes and lifestyles are always diffusing downwards from the upper classes. and that in some situations the diffusion of tastes may move in the opposite direction.\n\nIt has also been argued that the association between social class and taste is no longer quite as strong as it used to be. For instance, theorists of the Frankfurt School have claimed that the diffusion of mass cultural products has obscured class differences in capitalist societies. That is that products consumed passively by members of different social classes are virtually all the same, with only superficial differences regarding to brand and genre. Other criticism has concentrated on the declassifying effects of postmodern culture; that consumer tastes are now less influenced by traditional social structures, and they engage in play with free-floating signifiers to perpetually redefine themselves with whatever they find pleasurable.\n\n\"Bad taste\" (also poor taste or vulgarity) is generally a title given to any object or idea that does not fall within a person's idea of the normal social standards of the time or area. Varying from society to society and from time to time, bad taste is generally thought of as a negative thing, but also changes with each individual. A contemporary view is that \"a good deal of dramatic verse written during the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods is in poor taste because it is bombast\" or high-sounding language with little meaning.\n\n\n"}

The Germans were perceived by most Estonians as liberators from the USSR and its repression, and hopes were raised for the restoration of the country's independence. The initial enthusiasm that greeted the German invasion changed to disappointment, resentment, and in part even to enmity within a year.\n\nDespite initial German policy not to recruit Estonians into the German Army, the commander of the German 18th Army, \"Generaloberst\" Georg von Küchler, established 26 Estonian-manned security detachments (), which by August 1941 had been formed into the 181st–186th Security Battalions (), each of 700 men. Motivated by hatred of the Soviet Union, volunteers were plentiful, and while the original intent was for these units to serve as guards in Estonia, they were sent to the front line and acquitted themselves well. By March 1942, there were 16 Estonian battalions and companies in the Soviet Union, totalling 10,000 men. In October 1942, the existing security battalions were re-organised into \"Eastern\" battalions, with the 181st becoming the 658th, the 182nd becoming the 659th, one company of the 184th becoming the 657th \"Eastern\" Company, the rest of the 184th becoming the 660th \"Eastern\" Battalion, and the 186th being converted into the \"Eastern\" Depot Battalion \"Narwa\". These were retitled as \"Estonian\" battalions on 1 January 1943.\n\nAlso in August 1941, the German police established defence detachments () in Estonia to combat partisans. In November the defence detachments were combined into defence battalions () or Schuma battalions, and by October 1942 there were 5,400 Estonians in 14 battalions, with another 5,100 Estonian civil police. In December 1943, the remaining 18 Schuma battalions were retitled \"Estonian Police Battalions\". Of these, eleven served in operational areas outside Estonia.\n\nIn the meantime, on 28 August 1942, the Germans had announced the formation of the Estonian SS Legion, as part of the Waffen-SS, an armed branch of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II. Its commander was \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Franz Augsberger. While the Estonian leadership would have preferred to reform the Estonian Army, sufficient volunteers came forward for the Legion to be officially established on 1 October at Heidelager near Dębica in occupied Poland. When created, the Legion comprised the 1st SS Volunteer Grenadier Regiment (), which was under the command of an Estonian, \"SS-Standartenführer\" Johannes Soodla. In January 1943, three of the best Schuma battalions were disbanded and their members joined the Legion or other Schuma battalions. In early 1943, in response to the introduction of conscription and unhappy with German policies, some Estonians fled to Finland and enlisted in the Finnish Army. Soon after, Estonians formed two companies of the 3rd Battalion of the Finnish 47th Infantry Regiment, and soon the 3rd Battalion was entirely made up of Estonians. It fought the Red Army on the Mannerheim Line, before helping form the Finnish 200th Infantry Regiment, which was made up of 310 Finns and 2,340 Estonians. The 200th Infantry Regiment continued fighting on the Mannerheim Line until August 1944 when it was disbanded.\n\nIn April 1943, I. Battalion of the 1st SS Volunteer Regiment was retitled Volunteer Battalion Narwa ( Narwa) and detached from the Legion. It joined the Nordic-recruited 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, replacing a Finnish SS battalion. Volunteer Battalion Narwa distinguished itself fighting as part of the 5th SS Division until it returned to Estonia in July 1944. About the same time as the I. Battalion was detached, the Legion became operational. Continuing manpower shortages resulted in the introduction of conscription at this time, with about 12,000 men called up, of whom about 5,300 were sent to the Legion.\n\nFrom spring 1943, some of the Estonian police battalions were used to form larger units, and many of their men volunteered for the Legion. The German authorities began conscripting Estonians over the winter of 1942-43. Conscripts were given a choice between serving in the Legion, auxiliary units of the German Wehrmacht or working in factories. Those who opted to serve with the Waffen-SS were offered the immediate return of their lands.\n\nIn May 1943, the Germans expanded the Legion to brigade size, initially titling it as the Estonian SS Volunteer Brigade (), under the command of Augsberger. The 1st SS Volunteer Regiment became the 45th SS Volunteer Regiment, and the 53rd Artillery Battalion was formed to support the brigade. In July 1943, the 657th Estonian Company and 660th Estonian Battalion were used to help form the 46th SS Volunteer Regiment as the second regiment of the brigade. In October, the brigade was retitled the 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade. Most of the officers and non-commissioned officers of the brigade were Estonian, including the two regimental commanders, and the brigade reached a strength of 5,099 men by December. From November the brigade had been committed to fighting partisans at Nevel near Velikiye Luki in the Soviet Union, and in December it moved further north to Staraya Russa where it joined the German 16th Army. The first steps in expanding the brigade into a division also began in December. In January 1944, the brigade was sent back to Estonia to help defend against a Soviet offensive.\n\nBy January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Red Army almost all the way to the border of German-occupied Estonia. On 24 January, the 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade was expanded into the 20th Estonian SS Volunteer Division (), under the command of Augsberger, now an \"SS-Oberführer\". Initially, the main fighting formations of the division were the 45th and 46th SS Volunteer Regiments, and the 20th SS Volunteer Artillery Regiment. A week later, general conscription-mobilization was announced in Estonia by the German authorities. On 7 February, the pre-war Prime minister Jüri Uluots switched his stand on mobilization when the Soviet Army reached the Estonian border. At the time the Estonian units under German control had about 14,000 men. Counting on a German debacle, Uluots considered it imperative to have large numbers of Estonians armed, through any means. Uluots even managed to tell it to the nation through the German-controlled radio: Estonian troops on Estonian soil have \"a significance much wider than what I could and would be able to disclose here\". This led to 38,000 men registering for the military, according to Romuald Misiunas and Rein Taagepera. Rolf-Dieter Müller states that 30,000 volunteered in addition to those conscripted, and another source states that the 20th SS Division received 15,000 volunteers, which was enough for it to reach full strength. The Estonian History Commission reported 32,000 men were conscripted after Uluots's call. After the mobilised men had made known their reluctance in being a part of the Waffen-SS and wearing the SS uniform, \"SS-Obersturmführer\" Bernhardt redefined the concept of volunteering: individuals do not matter any more and can no longer decide on volunteering; it is effectively the occupier who chooses which men, how many and for what purpose. The 20th SS Division received reinforcements, bringing the total of Estonian units up to 50,000 or 60,000 men. During the whole period at least 70,000 Estonians joined the German army, more than 10,000 may have died in action, about 10,000 reached the West after the war ended.\n\nEstonian officers and men in other units that fell under the conscription proclamation and had returned to Estonia had their rank prefix changed from \"SS\" to \"Waffen\" (\"Hauptscharführer\" would be referred to as a \"Waffen-Hauptscharführer\" rather than \"SS-Hauptscharführer\"). Since the wearing of SS runes on the collar was forbidden by Augsberger on 21 April 1943, these formations wore national insignia instead.\n\nAfter the Soviet Kingisepp–Gdov Offensive, the division was ordered to be replaced on the Nevel front and transported to the Narva front, to defend Estonia.\n\nThe arrival of the I.Battalion, 1st Estonian Regiment at Tartu coincided with the prepared landing operation by the left flank of the Leningrad Front to the west coast of Lake Peipus, 120 kilometres south of Narva. The I.Battalion, 1st Estonian Regiment was placed at the Yershovo Bridgehead on the east coast of Lake Peipus. Estonian and German units cleared the west coast of Peipsi of Soviets by 16 February. Soviet casualties were in thousands.\n\nOn 8 February 1944, the division was attached to \"SS-Obergruppenführer\" and General of the Waffen-SS Felix Steiner's III SS (Germanic) Panzer Corps, then defending the Narva bridgehead. The division was to replace the remnants of the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, which were struggling to hold the line against a Soviet bridgehead north of the town of Narva. Upon arriving at the front on 20 February, the division was ordered to eliminate the Soviet bridgehead. In nine days of heavy fighting, the division pushed the Soviets back across the river and restored the line. The division remained stationed in the Siivertsi and Auvere sectors, being engaged in heavy combat.\n\nIn April, the 658th and 659th Estonian Battalions were transferred to the Waffen-SS to become II. and I. Battalions of the newly-formed 47th SS Volunteer Grenadier Regiment respectively. The commander of the 658th Estonian Battalion, Major Alfons Rebane had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in February, and was reluctant to transfer to the division. Rebane commanded the 47th SS Volunteer Grenadier Regiment, and was also Augsberger's deputy commander.\n\nOn 26 May, the division was retitled to become the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) (.\n\nIn May, the division was still 5,000 men understrength, so it was pulled out of the front line and reformed with the recently returned \"Narwa\" battalion absorbed into the division as the reconnaissance battalion. By that time, active conscription of Estonian men into the German armed forces was well under way. By Spring 1944, approximately 32,000 men were drafted into the German forces, with the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division consisting of some 15,000 men.\n\nIn July 1944, the Volunteer Battalion Narwa returned to Estonia and was absorbed by the division. Also in July, the division reached full combat strength.\n\nWhen Steiner ordered a withdrawal to the Tannenberg Line on 25 July, the division was deployed on the Lastekodumägi Hill, the first line of defence for the new position. Over the next month, the division was engaged in a heavy defensive battle in the Sinimäed hills.\n\nOn 26 July, pursuing the withdrawing defenders, the Soviet attack fell onto the Tannenberg Line. The Soviet Air Force and artillery bombarded the German positions, destroying most of the forest on the hills. On the morning of 27 July, the Soviet forces launched another powerful artillery barrage on the Sinimäed.\n\nThe heaviest Soviet attack took place on 29 July. By noon, the Red Army had almost seized control of the Tannenberg Line. The last reserve on the front, I.Battalion, 1st Estonian Regiment had been spared from the previous counterattacks. The scarcity of able-bodied men forced \"Sturmbannführer\" Paul Maitla to request reinforcements from patients in the field hospital. Twenty injured men responded, joining the remnants of other units including a part of the Kriegsmarine and supported by the single remaining Panther tank. The counterattack started from the parish cemetery south of the Tornimägi with the left flank of the assault clearing the hill of Soviet soldiers. The attack continued towards the summit under heavy Soviet artillery and bomber attack, culminating in close combat on the Soviet positions. The Estonian troops moved into the trenches. Running out of ammunition, they used Soviet grenades and automatic weapons taken from the fallen. According to some veterans, it appeared that low-flying Soviet bombers were attempting to hit every individual Estonian soldier moving between craters, some of them getting buried under soil from the explosions of Soviet shells. The Soviets were forced to retreat from the Grenaderimägi Hill.\n\nThe 20th Waffen Grenadier Division was fully raised by August 1944, and had a strength of 13,500 men.\n\nIn mid-August, the division's 45th \"Estland\" and 46th regiments were formed into \"Kampfgruppe\" Vent and sent south to help defend the Emajõgi river line, seeing heavy fighting.\n\nOn 20 August, III. Battalion of the 46th SS Volunteer Grenadier Regiment was formed from I. Battalion of the Finnish 200th Infantry Regiment, which had recently returned to Estonia.In total, 1,800 Estonian former members of the 200th Infantry Regiment joined the division in August.\n\nAs their largest operation, supported by the 37th and 38th Estonian Police Battalions and a tank squadron commanded by Mauritz Freiherr von Strachwitz, they destroyed the bridgehead of two Soviet divisions and recaptured Kärevere Bridge by 30 August. The operation shifted the entire front back to the southern bank of the Emajõgi and encouraged the II Army Corps to launch an operation attempting to recapture Tartu. The attack of 4–6 September reached the northern outskirts of the city but was repulsed by units of the Soviet 86th, 128th, 291st and 321st Rifle Divisions. Relative calm settled on the front for the subsequent thirteen days. By September, the division totalled 15,400 men, of whom two-thirds were conscripts. Also in September, the badly-mauled 2nd Estonian Police Regiment was disbanded and its personnel were absorbed by the division. The 2nd Estonian Police Regiment had been formed in July from three veteran police battalions, and had formed part of \"Kampfgruppe\" \"Jeckeln\" commanded by the Higher SS and Police Leader for Northern Russia, \"SS-Obergruppenführer\" and General of Waffen-SS and Police, Friedrich Jeckeln, who was executed for war crimes after the war. On 29 October 1944, the 287th Estonian Police Battalion was absorbed by the division. The 287th Estonian Police Battalion had been formed in April 1943 from men who had deserted from the Estonian-recruited Red Army 249th Rifle Division the previous month.\n\nSources differ on what happened next. According to Müller, when the German military retreated from Estonia, Estonian volunteers in the Waffen-SS were forced to remain with their units. The author Samuel Mitcham states that all troops wishing to remain in Estonia were released from German service. The author Chris Bishop states that in September 1944, many Estonian troops were released from German service, and the remaining troops were evacuated from Estonia to the Neuhammer training grounds, where the formation was reconstructed from October onwards. In December 1944, the 37th and 38th Estonian Police Battalions were absorbed by the division. The 20th Waffen Grenadier Division was almost destroyed during fighting in late 1944 or early 1945.\n\nEventually, the reformed division, which numbered roughly 11,000 Estonians and 2,500 Germans, returned to the front line in late February, just in time for the Soviet Vistula-Oder Offensive. This offensive forced the German forces back behind the Oder and Neisse rivers. The division was pushed back to the Neisse, taking heavy casualties. The division was then trapped with the \"XI. Armeekorps\" in the Oberglogau - Falkenberg/Niemodlin area in Silesia. By February, the division was so depleted that it was referred to as a \"SS-kampfgruppe\", not as a division. On 17 March 1945, the \"kampfgruppe\" launched a major escape attempt, which despite making headway, failed. On 19 March, it tried again, this time succeeding, but leaving all heavy weapons and equipment behind in the pocket.\n\nIn April, the remnants of the division were moved south to the area around Goldberg. After the Prague Offensive, the division attempted to break out to the west, in order to surrender to the western Allies. The Czech partisans resumed their hostilities on the surrendered Estonian troops regardless of their intentions. In what veterans of the Estonian Division who had laid their weapons down in May 1945 recall as the Czech Hell, the partisans chased, tortured and humiliated the Waffen SS men and murdered more than 500 Estonian POWs. Some of the Estonians who had reached the western allies were handed back to the Soviets.\n\nIn the spring of 1946, out of the ranks of those who had surrendered to the Western allies in the previous year, a total of nine companies were formed. One of these units, the 4221st Guard Company, formed from some 300 men on 26 December 1946, guarded the external perimeter of the Nuremberg International Tribunal courthouse and the various depots and residences of US officers and prosecutors connected with the trial. The men also guarded the accused Nazi war criminals held in prison during the trial, up until the day of execution.\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials, in declaring the Waffen-SS a criminal organization, explicitly excluded conscripts in the following terms:\n\nThe Nuremberg tribunal ruled that the 30,000 Estonians who had served in the Baltic Legions were conscripts, not volunteers, and defined them as freedom fighters protecting their homelands from a Soviet occupation and as such they were not true members of the criminal Waffen SS.\n\nSubsequently on 13 April 1950, a message from the Allied High Commission (HICOG), signed by John J. McCloy to the Secretary of State, clarified the US position on the Baltic Legions: \"they were not to be seen as 'movements', 'volunteer', or 'SS'. In short, they had not been given the training, indoctrination, and induction normally given to SS members\".\n\nWith the full support of Nuremberg and Allied High Commission, the US Displaced Persons Commission declared in September 1950 that: \"The Baltic Waffen SS Units (Baltic Legions) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose, ideology, activities, and qualifications for membership from the German SS, and therefore the Commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the United States.\"\n\nFollowing the war the Soviet authorities investigated the involvement of various Estonian military units including members of the 20th Division for involvement in the killings at the Klooga concentration camp. In 1951 the War Tribunal of the Leningrad Military District indicted and convicted 11 members of the 3rd Company of the 287th Police Battalion for the killings and they were sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.\n\nRuth Bettina Birn wrote in 2001 that the execution of 2,000 prisoners of German camps in Estonia, including the Klooga concentration camp, was conducted by Estonian soldiers of the division and presumably an Estonian Schutzmannschaft Battalion under German command.\n\nIn 2006 the Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity reviewed the evidence from both the Soviet and German trials and found that the 287th Police Battalion had participated. Most of the members of this battalion were subsequently transferred to the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division. The Estonian International Commission also stated in its report that the training and replacement units located proximate to Klooga were not a part of the division but subordinated to the Commander-in-Chief of the Waffen-SS in Ostland \"SS-Obergruppenführer\" Walter Krüger. According to the indictment of the aborted 1974 West German trial of Krüger's subordinate \"Sturmbannführer\" Georg Ahlemann, who was the commander of the training unit, approximately 70 recruits had been ordered to guard the perimeters of the Klooga camp.\n\nMost living veterans of the division belong to the 20th Estonian Waffen Grenadier Division Veterans Union (Estonian: \"20. Eesti Relvagrenaderide Diviisi Veteranide Ühendus\"). It was founded in 2000 and gatherings of veterans of the division are organised by the union on the anniversaries of the battle of the Tannenberg Line in the Sinimäed Hills. Since 2008, the chairman of the union, Heino Kerde, is a former member of the 45th Regiment.\n\nIn 2002, the Estonian government forced the removal of a monument to Estonian soldiers erected in the Estonian city of Pärnu. The inscription \"To Estonian men who fought in 1940-1945 against Bolshevism and for the restoration of Estonian independence\" was the cause of the controversy. The monument was rededicated in Lihula in 2004 but was soon removed because the Estonian government opposed the opening. On 15 October 2005 the monument was finally moved to the grounds of the Museum of Fight for Estonia's Freedom in Lagedi near the Estonian capital, Tallinn.\n\nOn 28 July 2007, a gathering of some 300 veterans of the 20th Waffen-Grenadier-Division and of other units of the \"Wehrmacht\", including a few \"Waffen SS\" veterans from Austria and Norway, took place in Sinimäe, where the battle between the German and Soviet armies had been particularly fierce. A gathering takes place every year that has seen veterans attending from Estonia, Norway, Denmark, Austria and Germany.\n\nThe following units made of the division:\n\nEach grenadier regiment consisted of three battalions, and the artillery regiment consisted of four battalions – three equipped with 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzers and one with 15 cm sFH 18 heavy howitzers.\n\nThe following officers commanded the division:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a part of the Huntington Beach Union High School District. Edison is a California Distinguished School. The graduation rate at Edison is 94%. Thirty-three percent of Edison graduates attend a four-year university and 61% attend community college or trade school. Twenty five total AP, Honors, and Accelerated level courses are offered at Edison. Edison is a largely sports-centered high school, with 30 CIF championships and 255 League championships.\n\nThe school was built on land donated by Southern California Edison, from which its name is derived.\n\nThe Academy of Sustainability and Engineering at Edison (ASE) is a STEAM-based program which emphasizes real-life application of mathematics and sciences. The program is directed by Andrea Harrell. ASE students take slightly specialized math and science classes which are directed towards sustainability and engineering. The ASE program and, specifically, students who are ASE Lab Specialists, often use the Innovation Lab, an area at Edison which implements sustainable aquaponics systems, houses a variety of marine specimens, and is used by the robotics team, among other features. The establishment of the Innovation Lab was spearheaded by Edison science teacher and Assistant Director of ASE Greg Gardiner. Mr. Gardiner was named 2018 California Teacher of the Year due to his ability to engage students, his work with developmentally disabled students, his hands-on teaching style, and his positive energy. ASE also runs several gardens at Edison which showcase native plants such as succulents in their natural habitats. All ASE students participate in a stewardship event, in which they take part in some type of action that will positively affect the local environment. ASE also offers a Robotics and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Program, which competes against other schools as well as an E-sports team.\n\nThe Model United Nations (MUN) program at Edison simulates United Nations committees in order to teach students skills of research, public speaking, debating, and writing, as well as critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. This Honors-level program also teaches students basic social studies information alongside MUN assignments, projects, and conferences. After Freshman year, a typically small cut occurs, allowing only two classes (seventy-four students) as Sophomores in MUN. After Sophomore year, the program is reduced to one class, which remains until Senior year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1974884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974884", "title": "City College of San Francisco", "text": "City College of San Francisco\n\nCity College of San Francisco (CCSF or City College) is a public community college in San Francisco, California. Founded as a junior college in 1935, the college plays an important local role, annually enrolling as many as one in nine San Francisco residents. CCSF is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC).\n\nComprising the entire San Francisco Community College District, CCSF is the only community college in San Francisco. The Ocean Avenue campus, bordering the Sunnyside, Westwood Park and Ingleside neighborhoods, is the college's largest location. The college has other campuses in South San Francisco, Financial District, Little Saigon, South of Market, Bayview-Hunters Point, Marina District, North of Panhandle, and Mission District.\n\nCCSF offers courses in more than 50 academic programs and over 100 occupational disciplines. There is a wide selection of credit courses that lead to an associate degree, which can be used to meet the general education requirements for transfer to four-year institutions. City College of San Francisco has articulation agreements with the California State University system, the University of California system, and other private and public universities in California and across the United States. Free non-credit courses in subjects such as ESL and citizenship as well as adult education classes are also provided.\n\nThe founding of a junior college in San Francisco had long been the dream of Archibald Jeter Cloud, the Chief Deputy Superintendent of the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). In response to Black Tuesday and the ensuing Great Depression, Cloud worked to convince the San Francisco Board of Education of the necessity of a junior college in Depression-era San Francisco and of the District's financial ability to form one. Cloud's presentation of fiscal studies in 1934 convinced the Board of the availability of Federal and State funding for a junior college. City College of San Francisco was established by the Board of Education of the San Francisco Unified School District on February 15, 1934 and officially opened on August 26, 1935 as San Francisco Junior College. The college had no central campus at the time. Instruction began on September 4, 1935, with morning classes held at the University of California Extension building on Powell Street and afternoon classes held at Galileo High School. The long distance between the two locations gave the College the nickname \"Trolley Car College.\" Increasing enrollment gave way to the College's expansion to Lick-Wilmerding High School, Samuel Gompers Trade School, Marina Junior High School, and other locations. A permanent main campus near Ocean Avenue was approved by the San Francisco Board of Education in 1937 and opened in 1940 with the opening of Science Hall.\n\nIn February 1948, the name was changed to City College of San Francisco. It now consists of eleven campuses, the Ocean Campus being the primary one.\n\nIn 1970, the college separated from the San Francisco Unified School District. The college continued to hold noncredit education programs throughout San Francisco's neighborhoods. However, as a result of CCSF's rapid growth, the San Francisco Community College District divided the programs between a division for credit courses at the Ocean Campus and one other division for noncredit courses throughout locations in San Francisco. The two educational divisions merged as a single division in 1990 with program locations held at campuses of City College of San Francisco.\n\nSince the 1990s, the college has significantly renovated and expanded its locations and developed new buildings and facilities throughout San Francisco.\n\nSince its founding in 1935, City College has evolved into a multicultural, multi-campus community college that is one of the largest in the country. CCSF offers courses in more than 50 academic programs and over 100 occupational disciplines. There is a full range of credit courses leading to the Associate of Arts and Associate of Science degrees, most of which meet the general education requirements for transfer to a four-year colleges and universities.\n\nIn 2012, the college began experiencing significant public turmoil. On July 2, 2012, the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC), gave the college eight months to prove it should remain accredited and ordered it to \"make preparations for closure\". As summarized by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" in 2015, \"the commission has never found wrongdoing or substandard instruction, but has said the college should lose accreditation because of tangled governance structures, poor fiscal controls and insufficient self-evaluation and reporting.\" In September 2012, the state chancellor's office warned that a special trustee would be appointed to oversee the institution's finances if the college did not voluntarily invite one; the board of trustees voted to invite a special trustee, despite student protests and objection. A report issued by California's Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance team in September 2012 found the institution to be in a \"perilous financial position\" caused largely by \"poor decisions and a lack of accountability.\n\nIn July of 2013, the ACCJC elected to take action to terminate the college's accreditation, subject to a one-year review and appeal period. The decision was based on a variety of deficiencies in standards. A Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team report was expected to be released by the end of July 2013. Nearly two months later, San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera filed two legal challenges to stop the ACCJC from revoking City College of San Francisco's accreditation alleging conflicts of interest, a faulty evaluation process, and a politically motivated decision-making process. The 2013 decision to revoke accreditation in 2014 was put on hold pending the legal challenges. In January 2015, with the legal conflict still ongoing, ACCJC said that CCSF remained out of compliance with standards in 32 areas but granted the college a two-year extension for resolving these issues and avoiding a shutdown.\n\nIn 2017, ACCJC reaffirmed the college's accreditation for seven years. It operates with approximately $22M annual Stabilization funding from the California legislature which will expire in 2021. For the 2017/18 Fiscal year, the Board of Trustees approved a $49M Deficit budget.\n\nAfter the accreditation crisis in 2012, CCSF was having low student enrollment issues. In the years that followed the crisis, student enrollment went from 90,000 students down to 60,000 students by 2017. In February 2017, the City of San Francisco began offering free tuition at CCSF for San Francisco city residents in a two year pilot program called “Free City College”. The money for the free tuition was raised from Proposition W, a transfer of properties tax on property sold over $5 million. By Fall 2017, student enrollment was increased by 16% (4,900 students). However, a financial audit in 2019 showed that the college was still in dire straits with deficits for at least three years and nearly $14 million more in spending than revenue during the previous fiscal year.\n\nCCSF is part of the San Francisco Community College District which is independent and co-extensive with the City and County of San Francisco and part of the California Community Colleges System. The district's Board of Trustees is elected by San Francisco residents. District funds are allocated from the state legislature, local property taxes, student tuition and fees, lottery funds, sales tax funds, and miscellaneous sources.\n\nUnique to California Community Colleges, CCSF support staff are pooled in the County of San Francisco's Civil Service system, so they may transfer between the community college and other City/County of San Francisco departments and participate in the City and County's benefit programs. This is an exception to academic independence enabled by Education Code section 88137. College administrators do not have control of hiring and placement of classified staff. Although it allows for benefit and seniority portability, CCSF classified staff are not paid at the same rate as their equivalent in other city/county department, so transfer to the college is effectively a demotion.\n\nCity College of San Francisco is located in an urban environment and has the associated crime rate. All campuses are maintained by the San Francisco Community College District Police Department (SFCCDPD). The SFCCDPD has twenty eight police officers and nine civilian employees.\n\nAlthough most colleges and universities have auxiliary foundations for fundraising, the foundation of City College's assets were frozen in 2010 for illegal use, leading to felony money laundering charges against the college's chancellor. The Foundation subsequently made a break from the College, and today, the college has a quasi-endowment of a little over $1M that it does not control.\n\nCCSF officially opened in 1935, during the Depression era, at the Industrial school, a school for juvenile delinquents, at the Ocean/Phelan Avenue site. Instruction began on September 4, 1935, with morning classes held at the University of California Extension Division building on Powell Street and afternoon classes at Galileo High School with students moving between sites using the trolley system at the time. As the student population grew, classes became available at other sites across San Francisco at a variety of sites. As Juila Bergman writes in the book \"City College of San Francisco\", \"Thus, in a real sense, the history of the college is a history of San Francisco and its transportation system.\"\n\nToday it has a main campus (called Ocean Campus) but it also has 10 other satellite locations across San Francisco. Commonly called \"campuses,\" but recently renamed as \"centers,\" these are technically \"Academic Centers\" and \"outreach Operations\" in the state-approved framework of the California Community Colleges System, having less than the range of educational facilities and services offered at a typical community college campus.\n\n\nThe Airport Center is not state approved and has never been state approved, and the other centers are grandfathered but would not be permitted to open under current California Community College guidelines.\n\nMost of the early art on CCSF campus was due to the work of Timothy L. Pflueger, the architect who was in charge of designing CCSF in the 1930s. Pflueger was on a committee of well-known Beaux-Arts architects organizing and designing the Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) and he put together a large exhibit of \"Art in Action in 1940,\" showcasing a number of artists (from various genres) on display, engaged in creating works. Many of these artworks from GGIE now permanetely live at CCSF's Ocean Campus.\n\nDiego Rivera's work \"Pan American Unity\", originally created for the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1940, has been displayed at the theater at the Ocean Campus of San Francisco City College since 1961. This large mural stands, 22' high and 74' long made up of 5 panels. The mural was entitled by Rivera, \"“Unión de la Expresión Artistica del Norte y Sur de este Continente” \"(\"The Marriage of the Artistic Expression of the North and of the South on this Continent\") but now commonly called \"Pan American Unity. \"There are three self-portraits and a portrait on his wife, artist Frida Kahlo within this mural. As of 2014, City College is in the process of supporting \"The Diego Rivera Mural Project, \"with goals return of the mural to the position of public importance, stabilize the environment for the mural and secure funding to make the project self supportive.\n\nFrederick E. Olmsted's 1941 \"Theory and Science\" mural is located at CCSF's Ocean Campus in the Science Hall's west entrance. This is two 12′ x 8′ tempera frescos murals and depicts a range of careers in the sciences, featuring men, women and people of color doing things such as viewing bacteria through a microscope, conducting field research, and excavating dinosaur remains. Olmsted also created two large, limestone sculptures of Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Edison heads that are on display in the Ocean Campus middle courtyard. The giant Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Edison heads were created in 1940 as part of the Golden Gate International Exposition's \"Art in Action\" exhibition and later given to CCSF for care and display.\n\nBeniamino Bufano was a California-based Italian American sculptor, best known for his large-scale monuments representing peace. Bufano's sculpture \"Saint Francis of the Guns of 1968\" stands at San Francisco City College in front of the Science Building. It is a statue of Saint Francis of Assisi—San Francisco's namesake—made from melted-down guns mixed with bronze to prevent rust from the city's dampness; this work was inspired by that year's assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. The sculpture is of a 9-ft tall figure of a robed Catholic saint, his arms spread in peaceful greeting. On his robe, Bufano created a mosaic tile mural showing the glowing heads of four of America's assassinated leaders: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert Kennedy and John F. Kennedy. This was one of Bufano's last works before he died.\n\nDudley C. Carter has three works at the CCSF Ocean Campus, including \"The Ram\" sometimes called Mountain Ram, \"Goddess of the Forest,\" and \"The Beast \"sculptures\". \"Dudley had donated The Ram because he knew it was the school mascot and it had been part of the Golden Gate International Exposition's Arts in Action exhibition. The Ram sculpture stood outside on the campus periodically changing locations from time to time, students would coat it in paint with campus colors red and white. Sometimes rival schools would repaint The Ram in their own school colors. By 1980 The Ram had many layers of paint and damage and in Spring of 1983 it was restored by Carter with use of a pick axe and its original, natural redwood. Currently located in the lobby of Conlan Hall, on the Ocean Campus. \"The Goddess of the Forest\" is another redwood sculpture created during GGIE, it is very large standing at 26 feet tall and had a girth at the base of 21 feet. For years this piece was located at Golden Gate Park, until 1986 when it began to show distress and decay. It was then moved to CCSF to an indoor location awaiting restoration.\n\nIn 2004, the then Governor of Veracruz, Mexico, Miguel Alemán Velazco presented CCSF with a reproduction of an Olmec colossal head in honor of the new Pan-American Center. The gift, a 14-ton, 9-foot tall replica of “El Rey” (The King) San Lorenzo #1 created in volcanic tuff is now the centerpiece of the proposed Frida Kahlo Garden next to the Diego Rivera Theater at City College of San Francisco. The artist that carved the replica was Ignacio Perez Solano, also known as “il Maestro.” This is only one of five Olmec heads reproductions in the United States and is viewed by some as the \"mother culture\" of Mexico.\n\nTwo 50′ x 45′ low-relief polished marble mosaics by the Swiss-born artist Herman Volz are located in the south portico of San Francisco City College's Science Hall, located on Ocean Campus. The murals are named \"Organic and Inorganic Science\". The imagery of the mosaics represent fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics with text accompanying the mural that reads ‘\"Give me a base and I move the world.\"’ These murals were originally part of the Golden Gate International Exposition’s \"Art in Action\" show in 1940 on Treasure Island before they were moved to the college. The two mosaics took two years to install with a staff of eight workmen, Juan Breda served as assistant mosaicist for the project. The murals were restored in 2005.\n\nCity College of San Francisco has over 50 educational programs and more than 100 work training programs. CCSF has a transfer rate to four-year institutions of 60%, with 45.8% of transfer students transferring with an associate degree.\n\n\nFounded in 1936, the two-year hospitality program is the oldest of any kind on emphasizing culinary arts, with an annual average enrollment of 200 international students. This program offers culinary art, food service management, and hotel management.\n\nThe current facilities in Statler Wing are now home to a café (currently named Radius 99), cafeteria, and fine dining restaurant (Pierre Coste Room); four kitchens, a bake shop, three lecture rooms, a lecture/demonstration auditorium, the Alice Statler Library and Gifford Resource Center. The department has an ongoing enrollment of over 250 students from around the world.\n\nThe Student Activities Office provides resources, support and leadership training for eight Associated Students Councils and more than 80 clubs and student organizations. It sponsors a wide variety of concerts and lectures throughout the year. It funds the Book Loan Program, Dr. Betty Shabazz Family Resource Center, Multi-Cultural Resource Center, Queer Resource Center, Student Health, Students Supporting Students mentoring program, and Women's Resource Center.\n\nStudents can also avail themselves of the Fitness Center, nationally ranked intercollegiate sports, and participate in the College's award-winning intercollegiate Speech and Debate Program. The College also features a student-run newspaper, \"The Guardsman\", an award-winning magazine, ETC as well as television and radio stations. Performances given by students in music, dance, and theater arts further enhance campus life.\n\nCurrently, there is a Queer Alliance student group and a Queer Resource Center on campus. The Queer Resource Center is an informational and advocacy resource center for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender queer, intersex, questioning, and straight allies. The Queer Resource Center aims to empower and celebrate its demographic as well as its community, part of which they have supported the addition of new queer studies classes and a new queer-focused associate degree in 2019. The center has participated in anti-violence, anti-homophobia, and anti-transphobia rallies and workshops. The center has struggled with funding although this has caught the attention of politicians, notably the Green Party, whose candidate for board of trustees John Rizzo promised in 2006 funds for more LGBT studies and the Queer Resource Center.\n\nOn campus, there are numerous student activity groups, gender-specific courses, and health services. For example, the Women's Resource Center and Library (Smith Hall, 103–104) offers women on campus an opportunity to network with academic support services and resources, and Project Survive is a campus peer education group working to promote healthy relationships and end abuse and sexual violence.\n\nIntercollegiate athletics are offered for men and women. College teams belong in the CCCAA Coast Conference North Section and competes with teams from other colleges. Intercollegiate sports include baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, soccer, softball, tennis, track, badminton, volleyball, and judo. These teams are all nicknamed the Rams. City College of San Francisco Football Teams have won ten national championships. The annual rivalry football game is played against the College of San Mateo Football team.\n\nAll of the CCSF Rams teams are based on the Ocean Campus. The home venue for baseball is Carter Field. Softball is played at Fairmont Park. Football as well as track and field use Rams Stadium. A new Soccer Practice Field has been built north of the stadium. The Wellness Center, south of Rams Stadium, houses staff offices, weight rooms, a swimming pool, lockrooms, classrooms, and an indoor gym. East of Rams Stadium used to be the former site of the \"North Gym\" and the \"South Gym\", which used to contain the lockrooms, weight rooms, and staff offices. The Tennis Courts are across an access road from the former gyms.\n\nThis is a list of notable alumni from City College of San Francisco, listed in alphabetical order by last name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a list of notable faculty from City College of San Francisco, listed in alphabetical order by last name.\n\n"}

The story is a direct sequel to \"Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years\", a video game for the Sega Saturn that takes place immediately after the TV series ends, and before the movie begins. The movie won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 1998. Originally licensed by ADV Films, the movie, along with the TV Series have been re-licensed to Nozomi Entertainment.\n\nTwo years have passed since the third battle of Mars, with the Nadesico taking possession of the Ruin. The Earth and the Jovian Federation have come to an uneasy peace. However, Akito and Yurika have both vanished and are presumed dead. Meanwhile, a new threat to peace is rising in the form of the \"Martian Successors\" (A splinter group of the original Jovian Federation who wish to continue the war and take revenge on the Earth and Nergal and bring about a new world order). A 15-year-old Ruri Hoshino, is now the new captain of the highly-mobile battleship \"Nadesico B\", and has earned the respect and awe of many in the Military thanks to her unparalleled skill with machines, made her gains the nickname \"Cyber Fairy\".\n\nMost of the original Nadesico crew return in order to prevent the Earth from experiencing another war. Some of the crew have undergone slight changes; the Aestivalis pilot Ryoko now sports her naturally black hair color, but others (such as the pun-loving Izumi) have not changed at all. Two new crew members from Nadesico B join the original Nadesico crew, the first is a young boy named Ensign Hari Makibi, who like Ruri is a genetically engineered prodigy and has exceptional control over machines. The second is Saburota Takasugi, a former member of the Jovian Federation Defense Force who now serves as the Nadesico B's Tactical Officer, unlike other Jovian's who are generally chivalrous and very respectful of women, Saburota is something of a womanizer.\n\nWhile at Akito's Grave (it had been two years since Akito's disappearance) Ruri discovers that Akito is still alive. Akito explains that he and Yurika had been captured, while conducting Boson Jumping experiments by the Martian Successors. Akito had been tortured, his brain severely effected to the point of not being able to taste anything (thus being unable to cook) and his skin shining white like a comic book.\n\nAkito gives Ruri his recipe for Ramen Noodles as a way to remember the person he used to be.\nAkito leaves after fighting the Martian Successors and obtains a high powered battleship from Nergal in order to go to Mars and Rescue Yurika, The Nadesico C also heads to Mars intent on arresting the Martian Successors.\nAfter fighting and killing the Martian Successors leader Akito is able to rescue Yurika, meanwhile after taking control of all the Martian Successors' computers, Ruri is able to disable their weapons and force the Successors to surrender.\nFollowing their victory Akito departs, not wanting Yurika (who was regaining her consciousness) or anyone else to see how he has changed.\nWhen asked by Ryoko if they should go after Akito, Ruri says that Akito will return eventually and if he doesn't then she would go and find him personally because Akito was an important person to them all.\n\n\"Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years\", a video game for the Sega Saturn, was released September 23, 1998, one month after \"Prince of Darkness\" hit theaters. The game takes place immediately after the TV series ends, and before the movie begins, filling in on details that leads up to the plot of the movie. However, the game was never translated and released outside Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Frost, was an American illustrator, graphic artist and comics writer. He was also well known as a painter. Frost's work is well known for its dynamic representation of motion and sequence. Frost is considered one of the great illustrators in the \"Golden Age of American Illustration\". Frost illustrated over 90 books and produced hundreds of paintings; in addition to his work in illustrations, he is renowned for realistic hunting and shooting prints.\n\nFrost was born on January 17, 1851, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the eldest of ten children; his father was a literature professor. He became a lithographer, and in 1874 he was asked by a friend to illustrate a book of humorous short stories, \"Out of the Hurly Burly\", by Charles Heber Clark, which was a commercial success, selling more than a million copies.\n\nIn 1876, Frost joined the art department at the publisher Harper & Brothers, where he worked with such well-known illustrators as Howard Pyle, E. W. Kemble, Frederic Remington and C. S. Reinhart. While there, he learned a wide variety of techniques, from cartooning to what later came to be called photorealistic painting. Frost's color blindness may have helped his excellent use of grayscale. In 1877 and 1878, Frost went to London to study with some of the great cartoonists of the time. Later, he returned to Philadelphia and studied under painters Thomas Eakins and William Merritt Chase at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\n\nSoon after returning, he published several stories formed of sequential drawings with captions, pioneering the form that would later develop into comic strips and comic books. In 1884, Frost published \"Stuff and Nonsense\", an anthology of his works that advanced the concept of time-stop drawings and contained other innovations.\n\nFrost married another artist, illustrator Emily Louise Phillips, in 1883. From 1906 until May 1914, Frost and his family lived in France, attracted by the Impressionist movement. Returning to the United States, he continued work as an illustrator and comics artist, mainly for \"Life\" magazine. Frost died on June 22, 1928.\n\n\n"}

After about 1700, the bells were tuned to particular notes. \n\nThe device is probably most effective as a foil to light Baroque counterpoint of an upbeat nature, or hymns registered using a bright principal chorus.

{"id": "1974930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974930", "title": "Discovery of Fiji", "text": "Discovery of Fiji\n\nLocated in the central Pacific Ocean, Fiji's geography has made it both a destination and a crossroads for migrations for many centuries.\n\nAustronesian peoples are believed to have settled in the Fijian islands some 3,500 years ago, with Melanesians following around a thousand years later. Most authorities agree that they originated in Southeast Asia and came via Indonesia. Archeological evidence shows signs of settlement on Moturiki Island from 600 BC and possibly as far back as 900 BC.\n\nIn the 10th century, the Tu'i Tonga Empire was established in Tonga, and Fiji came within its sphere of influence. The Tongan influence brought Polynesian customs and language into Fiji. The empire began to decline in the 13th century.\n\nThe \"Fiji Times\" reported on 3 July 2005 that recent research by the Fiji Museum and the University of the South Pacific (USP) has found that skeletons excavated at Bourewa, near Natadola in Sigatoka, at least 3000 years old, belonged to the first settlers of Fiji, with their origins in South China or Taiwan. The skeletons are to be sent to Japan for assembling and further research. Obsidian, a rare volcanic glass found only in Papua New Guinea had been discovered there, according to Dr Patrick D. Nunn, USP Professor of Ocean Science and Geography, who theorized that the people could originally have left southern China or Taiwan some 7000 years ago, settling in Papua New Guinea before drifting on to Fiji and other countries. Lapita pottery found on the surface of the graves was almost 2500 years old, he said. Fiji Museum archaeologist Sepeti Matararaba said that the area beside the sea must have been occupied, because a great deal of pottery, hunting tools, and ancient shell jewellery had been discovered. More than 20 pits had been dug following the discovery of lapita in the area.\n\nOn 15 July 2005, it was reported that the same teams had uncovered 16 skeletons at Bourewa, near Natadola. The skeletons were found in a layer of undisturbed soil containing pottery from around 550 BC. Professor Nunn said there was now abundant evidence that Bourewa had been the first human settlement in the Fiji archipelago, occupied from around 1200 BC onwards. \"\"Lapita people were the first people to come to Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Tonga and Samoa. These people left evidence of their existence by mainly their elaborately decorated and finely fashioned pottery,\"\" Nunn said. He said the evidence pointed to Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands as the place from where the earliest Fijians came, as the pottery fragments were typical of the early Lapita period in Papua New Guinea and the Solomons, but not readily found on Lapita Pottery in Fiji.\n\nNunn announced on 9 November 2005 that a black obsidian rock discovered near Natadola in southwest Viti Levu had originated in the Kutau-Bao obsidian mine on Talasea Peninsula on the island of New Britain, in Papua New Guinea, some 4500 kilometers away. Although carried throughout the Western Pacific by the Lapita people, it is not often found in Fiji. The obsidian, which showed signs of being \"worked,\" probably arrived soon after the initial Lapita settlement in Bourewa circa 1150BC, Nunn said. He theorized that it was kept by the Lapita settlers as a talisman, a reminder of where they had come from.\n\nFiji Television reported on 20 March 2006 that an ancient Fijian village, believed to have been occupied by chiefs sometime between 1250 and 1560, had been discovered at Kuku, in Nausori. Its heavily fortified battle fort contained unique features not seen elsewhere in Fiji. Archeologist Sepeti Matararaba of the Fiji Museum expressed astonishment at some of the discoveries at the site, which included an iron axe used by white traders in exchange for Fijian artefacts. Local villages were reported to be rebuilding the site with a view to opening it up to tourists in July 2006.\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the indigenous Fijians of today are descendants of the chief Lutunasobasoba and those who arrived with him on the Kaunitoni canoe. Landing at what is now Vuda, the settlers moved inland to the Nakauvadra mountains. Though this oral tradition has not been independently substantiated, the Fijian government officially promotes it, and many tribes today claim to be descended from the children of Lutunasobasoba.\n\nDutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first known European visitor to Fiji, sighting the northern island of Vanua Levu and the North Taveuni archipelago in 1643. James Cook, the British navigator, visited one of the southern Lau islands in 1774. It was not until 1789, however, that the islands were charted and plotted, when William Bligh, the castaway captain of , passed Ovalau and sailed between the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu en route to Batavia, in what is now Indonesia. Bligh Water, the strait between the two main islands, is named after him, and for a time, the Fiji Islands were known as the \"Bligh Islands.\"\n\nThe first Europeans to settle among the Fijians were shipwrecked sailors and runaway convicts from Australian penal colonies. In 1804, the discovery of sandalwood on the southwestern coast of Vanua Levu led to an increase in the number and frequency of Western trading ships visiting Fiji. A sandalwood rush began in the first few years but it dried up when supplies dropped between 1810 and 1814. By 1820, the traders returned for \"beche-de-mer\" or sea cucumber. In the early 1820s, Levuka was established as the first European-style town in Fiji, on the island of Ovalau.\n"}

It has been advertised as \"The Ultimate Social Experiment\" and is produced by Ashton Kutcher, Jason Goldberg and J.D. Roth. The show's title is a parody of the titled film (and TV series) \"Beauty and the Beast\".\n\nThe premise of the show consists of a group of \"Beauties\" (young women who have relied primarily on their looks) and a group of \"Geeks\" (young men who have relied primarily on intellect rather than social aptitude or looks) who are paired up to compete as couples for a shared $250,000 and other prizes. (For the fourth season, the producers modified the formula to include an extra team consisting of a male \"beauty\" and a female \"geek\". For the fifth season, the beauties and geeks competed against each other at first, and teams of one beauty and one geek were not selected until the end of episode three.) Each beauty lives together in a room with her geek during the course of the competition. There are challenges shown each episode, one testing the beauties on a primarily academic subject, and another that has the geeks competing in a more popular/social realm. The winners of the challenges select two teams to compete against each other in a pure \"quiz show\" type question and answer session: the team with fewer correct answers gets eliminated.\n\nBy the end of the competition, many of the contestants say that they have learned much about interacting with people from a different social group (and positive lessons about the character of people from that group), positive things about themselves and their own character, and often something about human nature in general.\n\nAfter the airing of season 5 in 2008, production stopped and the show was cancelled.\n\nThe theme song, \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\" by the Pet Shop Boys (originally released in 1985), is used also on the British, Danish and Belgian-Dutch versions. Commercial promos for the show featured a different theme song, \"The Geeks Get the Girls\" by American Hi-Fi.\n\nFollowing the second season, the American version moved to The CW, the new network formed when both The WB and UPN ceased operations in September 2006. The two-hour season premiere for the third season aired Wednesday, January 3, 2007 at 8:00 p.m. EST on The CW. The fourth season premiered on September 18, making \"BATG\" the first series to premiere for the CW for the 2007-08 television season. \"Beauty and the Geek\" was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on March 12, 2008.\n\nAfter the fifth season, the show was put on indefinite hiatus in order to stoke renewed interest in the show, and perhaps the addition of innovative twists to the format.\nIn October 2008, casting began for a sixth season, scheduled to air on MTV, with minor celebrities as the beauties. However, a sixth season never materialized.\n\nRichard's title evolved throughout the show as he kissed Krystal (at end of episode 3 and aftermath show), Lauren (at end of episode 4) and Mindi (after the camping challenge while relaxing and during the post-final test confessional) over the show's course, hence being at first \"Has never kissed a girl\", then \"Has kissed one/two/three girl(s)\". Mindi promised Richard that if they won the competition, she would make out with him. On the aftermath show, Lauren attempted to make out with Richard, but Richard refused. After the host asked Richard the question that Richard lost with, Mindi, feeling confident of Richard not knowing the answer again, promised a make out session. Mindi initially was struggling with the notion, but stood up and made out with Richard. It was a quick French kiss with some tongue action.\n\nNote: Original partners Chris and Amanda won the first week's quiz challenge and were given the power to switch the partner of one team with another team or they themselves can switch partners. They choose the latter and broke up the team of Brandon and Tristin.\n\n\"First aired January 3, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired January 3, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired January 10, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired January 17, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired January 24, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired January 31, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired February 7, 2007\"\n\n\n\"First aired February 14, 2007\"\n\nAll previously eliminated contestants were brought back to spend one more night in the mansion and to assess which of the final two teams had undergone the most personal change. Their votes on this question would determine the winner of the $250,000 grand prize. Cecille was enraged by the twist, ranting to Nate about how unfair it was that the \"losers\" would get to decide their fate, and when Nate said she should try to make amends with them she expressed disgust with him. Nate, who by that point decided that winning would only reinforce Cecille's behavior, eventually asked contestants to vote against him; this was difficult for most of the cast as they genuinely liked him and wanted him to win but also tied into their collective anger over Cecille's bad behavior. This led to Megan and Scooter winning 7 to 2, with the remaining contestants not voting once a majority had been reached.\n\n\n\"First aired February 21, 2007\"\n\nMegan and Scooter and the other eliminated cast members reunite to talk about their experiences on the show and what is in store for them in the future. Cecille was bitter over losing at the end, claiming that no one in the show could have really changed and that they were stupid for thinking they could.\n\nSeason 4 featured several changes and was by far the most controversial one. One male beauty is paired with one female geek, but the rest of the pairs remained the same way (i.e. a male geek and a female beauty). The season was also extended from 8/9 episodes to 13, featuring a recap on week 7 and the cast growing from eight pairs to ten. This was also the first season to have a pair voted out (Natalie and John on week 8) instead of eliminated through a quiz, which sparked some controversy, much like Sam's previous experience in show business, despite the fact that many other beauties had some previous acting experience as well. In episode 6 the geeks have their make-overs\n\nThere was no elimination room finale; instead, the two challenge-winning teams selected a team to eliminate directly.\n\nIn the final episode on December 4, 2007, David and Jasmine won the $250,000. For the first time, the show's winner was decided by America's votes, four months after the taping of the first 12 episodes.\n\nThis season was taped during the summer, due to the prominence of Comic-Con International on one episode.\n\nSeason 5 premiered on March 11, 2008, taking over the timeslot of \"Reaper\". For the first three episodes, the beauties competed as a group against the team of geeks. The remaining beauties and geeks then paired off to compete against the other pairs, as in previous seasons.\n\nNote: John, Amber and Jillian were all eliminated before the teams paired. Jonathan was left without a partner and was therefore eliminated.\n\n For this challenge, one member of each team was to temporarily join the opposing team. It was then revealed that if the team lost their new member would be automatically eliminated.\n\n\nIn Brazil, the original American show is aired with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles on the paid TV channel \"Multishow\" and it's called \"As Gostosas e os Geeks\" (\"The Hotties and The Geeks\").\n\n"}
{"id": "1974943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974943", "title": "Nordic cross flag", "text": "Nordic cross flag\n\nThe Nordic cross flag is any of certain flags bearing the design of the Nordic or Scandinavian cross, a cross symbol in a rectangular field, with the center of the cross shifted towards the hoist.\n\nAll independent Nordic countries have adopted such flags in the modern period, and while the Scandinavian cross is named for its use in the national flags of the Scandinavian nations, the term is used universally by vexillologists, in reference not only to the flags of the Nordic countries but to other flags with similar designs. However; the sideways cross is also known as the Cross of Saint Philip the Apostle who preached not in Scandinavia but in Greece, Phrygia & Syria instead. \n\nThe cross design represents Christianity, and the characteristic shift of the center to the hoist side is early modern, first described the Danish civil ensign (\"Koffardiflaget\") for merchant ships in a regulation of 11 June 1748, which specified the shift of the cross center towards the hoist as \"the two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be lengths of those\". The Danish design was adopted for the flags of Norway (civil ensign 1821) and Sweden (1906), both derived from a common ensign used during the Union between Sweden and Norway 1818–1844, as well as Iceland (1915) and Finland (1917); some of the subdivisions of these countries used this as inspiration for their own flags. The Norwegian flag was the first Nordic cross flag with three colours. \nAll Nordic flags may be flown as gonfalons as well.\n\nNote that some of these flags are historical. Also, note that flag proportions may vary between the different flags and sometimes even between different versions of the same flag.\n\nThe Flag of Greenland is the only national flag of a Nordic country or territory without a Nordic Cross. When Greenland was granted home rule, the present flag - with a graphic design unique to Greenland - was adopted on June 1985, supported by fourteen votes against eleven who supported a proposed green-and-white Nordic cross.\n\nHistorical Flag of the Kalmar Union, which united Denmark, Sweden and Norway 1397 to 1523. No pictorial evidence survives of the Kalmar Union's Flag. The flag appearing here is a reconstruction based on references in 1430 letters by King Eric of Pomerania.\nThese flags either do not have official status or represent various private entities. They have not been officially adopted and their use remains limited.\n\nNordic flag designs very similar to Denmark's, Sweden's, and Norway's national flags were proposed as Germany's national flags in both 1919 and 1948, after World War I and World War II, respectively. Today, the Nordic cross is a feature in some city and district flags or coats of arms.\n\nA number of flags for localities in the United Kingdom (primarily Scotland) are based on Nordic cross designs, intended to reflect the Scandinavian heritage introduced to the British Isles during the Viking Age and through the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n"}

Kamiakin opened in the fall of 1970 and serves the district's northwest portion. The school colors are scarlet and gold and the mascot is the Braves.\n\nThe school is named after Kamiakin, a chief of the Yakama Tribe in the 19th century and a leader of the American Indian side in the Yakama War.\n\nKamiakin went through a remodel from 2002–04 that added 15 new classrooms, a new gymnasium and converted the existing lecture hall into an auditorium capable of seating 600 people as well as updating safety to meet standards throughout the campus.\n\nKamiakin is generally considered to be one of the highest ranked public high schools in all of southeastern Washington of size 3A or 4A (along with Hanford High School in nearby Richland) and is ranked among the top 1,500 best high schools in the nation by Newsweek. Kamiakin's four year graduation rate is 89.4% and 92.4% after five years, around 13% higher than the state average.\n\nIn 2014, 511 AP Exams were given, with 87% of students enrolled in one or more AP classes electing to take an exam. (Kamiakin is subsidizing AP tests starting in the 2015–2016 school year. Some teachers do require an AP test as a portion of the class. Each student may choose whether or not to take the test and must pay the reduced price should he or she decide to take it.)\nThe school's HSPE (High School Proficiency Exam) scores annually rank higher than district and state averages with a passing rate around five percent higher than the state average in both reading and writing.\n\nRunning Start is a program offered to Kamaiakin students, as well as other Washington State students, in grades 11 and 12. Kamiakin Running Start students get the opportunity to earn both high school and college credits from college courses taken at the nearby Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Washington. Students do not pay tuition, but they are required to pay mandatory fees, buy their own books, and provide their own transportation.\n\nIn 2014, 67% of Kamiakin graduates continued their education immediately after high school, 72% after two years, at a postsecondary school, 5% higher than the state average.

It is a crime novel set in Florida that centers on the death of singer Jimmy Stoma, the former lead man of \"Jimmy and the Slut Puppies\". This novel marks the first time Hiaasen used first-person point of view to deliver the novel. In previous works, he used third-person view.\n\nIn addition to being a murder mystery, the novel also explores a career in newspaper journalism, and is a screed against the downsizing of American newspapers and their corporate owners' emphasis on profitability over depth. This theme is introduced tentatively in Hiaasen's novel \"Lucky You\" but explored fully here.\n\nThe book is named for the fictional Jimmy Stoma's song. While writing the book, Hiaasen collaborated with singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, a longtime friend. The song appears as the second track on Zevon's 2002 album \"My Ride's Here\". It is quoted several times throughout the book, and is printed in its entirety at the end (credited to Jimmy Stoma and Warren Zevon).\n\nJack Tagger Jr., an obituary writer for the South Florida \"Union-Register\", becomes intrigued upon seeing a death notice for James Bradley Stomarti, also known as Jimmy Stoma. Jimmy was the lead man of the rock band Jimmy and the Slut Puppies. Jack interviews Jimmy's widow, pop singer Cleo Rio, who says that Jimmy died in a diving accident in the Bahamas. Cleo plugs her new upcoming album \"Shipwrecked Heart\", with a title song written by Jimmy and herself. However, after the obituary is printed, Jimmy's sister Janet tells him Cleo lied: Jimmy was working on his own comeback album. Jack gets more suspicious when he sees Jimmy's body in a funeral home and find that no autopsy was performed. However, before Jack can call for one, the body is cremated.\n\nJack used to be an investigative reporter, but was demoted to the obituary beat after publicly insulting Race Maggad III, the CEO of the newspaper's publishing company. His ambition is to climb back onto the front page by \"yoking my byline to some famous stiff.\" Jack's job of writing obituaries all day long has made him become morbidly obsessed with death, especially his own. Each year, Jack obsesses about people who died at his age, and about the fate of his deceased father Jack Tagger Sr., who disappeared when Jack was young. His mother refuses to say when Jack Sr. died, and he is paranoid about not living as long as his father did. These obsessions cost him his favorite girlfriend, Anne.\n\nDespite the refusal by Jack's editor, Emma, to let him investigate the rock star's death, he continues regardless. Parked outside Cleo's condominium one night, Jack sees her with a young male lover. Emma relents and gives Jack a week to investigate Jimmy's death. He tracks down Jay Burns, the Slut Puppies' old keyboardist, and Jimmy's dive partner. Jay is heavily stoned, but to Jack it is obvious he is lying about something. Later that night, a burglar breaks into Jack's apartment and attacks him with the frozen corpse of a dead Savannah Monitor lizard kept in his freezer. Jack is beaten unconscious, but the burglar disappears. A few hours later, two police detectives show up and tell him Jay has been found murdered.\n\nWith his apartment trashed, Jack goes to stay with Emma. When the two search Jay's boat find an external hard drive concealed inside the false bottom of a scuba tank. Meanwhile, Jack is depressed to hear from Carla Candilla, Anne's teenaged daughter, that Anne is marrying a spy novelist. Meeting her at a club, he catches sight of Cleo's boyfriend, a man who calls himself \"Loreal\" and claims to be her record producer. Jack and Emma are alarmed when Janet disappears from her home; Jack finds a small patch of blood on her carpet. With the help of Jack's best friend, sports writer Juan Rodriguez, Jack decrypts the hard drive and finds it contains master recordings for Jimmy's unfinished album. Listening to it, Jack is still baffled in looking for a motive for Jimmy's presumed murder. \n\nTo Jack's surprise, Emma spends the night with him at his apartment. A few days later, she excitedly tells him that Jimmy's bassist, Tito Negroponte, was shot but not killed in Los Angeles. Jack flies there and interviews Tito, who puts his finger on why Cleo killed Jimmy: she wanted a song from his album, titled \"Shipwrecked Heart\", for herself. Jack listens to the song, telling Emma that Cleo is desperate to put out another successful song before she fades from the scene, and believes Jimmy's song was better than anything she can write. Still, Jack admits that he cannot prove that Cleo killed Jimmy.\n\nCleo's bodyguard kidnaps Emma, and she demands the master in exchange for her. At Lake Okeechobee, Jack and Juan meet the bodyguard and Loreal, and trade the master for Emma. The bodyguard tries to kill all of them, but ends up upending the airboat he is driving, with fatal results for himself and Loreal. On Jack's 47th birthday the next day, his mother sends him a card and an obituary revealing that Jack Sr. died at age 46. He feels relieved to have lived longer than his father. Janet resurfaces, having fled Cleo's goons, and admits that she switched the tags on a pair of coffins at the funeral home, meaning Jimmy was actually buried in the wrong man's grave. At her request, the body is exhumed, and a pathologist finds that Jimmy was drugged before he drowned. Cleo is convicted of murder; Jack sails back onto the front page covering the story while Jimmy's posthumous album is a success.\n\nA subplot focuses on Jack's ongoing conflict with Race Maggad III, and the ailing state of the \"Union-Register\" since Maggad bought it. Maggad's downsizing policy leads to more space in the paper devoted to advertisements than to news, fewer staffers employed, and stories that are deferential to business interests and lacking in depth. Jack finds an ally in MacArthur Polk, the newspaper's former publisher, who owns a large number of shares in Maggad's publicly traded company. Maggad is desperate to buy the shares back before two foreign companies initiate a hostile takeover. Polk dies and names Jack as trustee of his shares, with instructions that Maggad can have the stock back only if he sells the \"Union-Register\" back to Polk's widow Ellen. Maggad reluctantly agrees. Ellen restores the paper's obituary section to its format prior to Maggad's purchase, arranges for more reporters to be hired, and expands its news coverage. Emma is promoted, and the novel ends as she is trying to talk Jack back from his leave of absence from journalism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1974975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974975", "title": "Fiji during the time of Cakobau", "text": "Fiji during the time of Cakobau\n\nThe first three-quarters of the 19th century were marked by tribal warfare, incursions from neighbouring Tonga, and the increasing encroachment of foreign powers. This period also saw the rise of a warlord by the name of Seru Epenisa Cakobau, who forged the first nation-state covering all of modern Fiji (except the island of Rotuma) in 1871, before ceding it to the United Kingdom in 1874.\n\nIn the early 1820s, Levuka was established as the first modern town in Fiji, on the island of Ovalau. The intervention of European traders and missionaries, of whom the first arrived from Tahiti in 1830, led to increasingly serious wars among the native Fijian confederacies. Supplied with weapons by Swedish mercenary Charlie Savage, Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa, the Vunivalu (a chiefly title meaning \"Warlord,\" often translated also as \"Paramount Chief\") of Bau Island, defeated the much larger Burebasaga Confederacy and succeeded in subduing much of western Fiji. \n\nHis successor, Seru Epenisa Cakobau, fought to consolidate Bauan domination throughout the 1850s and 1860s, and started calling himself the \"Tui Viti,\" or King of Fiji. He faced opposition from local chiefs who saw him at best as first among equals, and also from the Tongan Prince Enele Ma'afu, who had established himself on the Island of Lakeba in the Lau archipelago in 1848. \n\nA Christian, Ma'afu brought Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga, and the Methodist Church gained its first foothold in Fiji. Most chiefs in the west regarded the Wesleyan missionaries, aligned as they were seen to be with Ma'afu, as a threat to their power, refused conversion, and resisted missionary attempts to set up outposts in their villages.\n\nCakobau's claimed position was also undermined by international developments. The United States threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul, John Brown Williams. His trading store had been looted by Fijian natives following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a Fourth of July celebration in 1849. When his Nukulau Island house was subjected to an arson attack in 1855, the commander of the United States naval frigate demanded compensation amounting to 5000 pounds for Williams from Cakobau, as the \"Tui Viti.\" \n\nThis initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling 45,000 pounds. Cakobau was faced with a dilemma. To disclaim responsibility for the debt, he would have to deny his self-proclaimed and still far-from-universally accepted sovereignty. To admit responsibility, he would have to undertake to pay the debt, or else face punishment from the United States Navy. He chose the latter course, hoping that the United States was only bluffing.\n\nReality began to catch up with Cakobau in 1858, when the USS \"Vandalia\" sailed into Levuka. Unable to pay his debt, and faced with increasing encroachments onto Viti Levu's south coast from Ma'afu, Cakobau approached the British consul with an offer to cede the islands to the United Kingdom, if only they would assume responsibility for his debt in return for 5,000 square kilometres of land. \n\nHis insistence on being allowed to retain his questionable title of \"Tui Viti\" proved unacceptable to the British government, which turned his offer down after four years of consideration in 1862. This followed a report from Colonel W.J. Smythe, who had come to the conclusion, after interviewing every Paramount Chief in Fiji, that Cakobau's title was self-assumed and by no means universally accepted by his fellow chiefs, and that he did not have the authority to cede the islands.\n\nCakobau next turned to the Australian-based Polynesia Company. The rising price of cotton in the wake of the American Civil War (1861–1865) had interested the Polynesia Company in acquiring land in Fiji for planting. In return for 5,000 km², the company agreed to pay Cakobau's debt. Australian settlers landed on of land in Viti Levu, near what was then a Fijian village called Suva, in 1868.\n\nThe Polynesia Company settlers were joined by a further several thousand planters throughout the 1860s and 1870s. Often fraudulently, they obtained Fijian land, often in exchange for weapons or alcohol. Competing land claims followed, with no unified government to settle the disputes. Frustrations peaked following the collapse of cotton prices and the destruction of the crop by hurricanes in 1870. \n\nIn June 1871, John Bates Thurston, the British honorary consul, forged a \"marriage of convenience\" between Cakobau and the settlers, and persuaded the Fijian chiefs to accept a constitutional monarchy with Cakobau as king, but with real power in the hands of a cabinet and Legislature dominated by settlers. The Legislative Assembly met for the first time in Levuka in November 1871.\n\nThe new arrangements proved no more workable than the old. Within months, government overspending had led to the accumulation of another unmanageable debt. In 1872, following continuing economic and social unrest, Thurston approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands. The British were much more sympathetic to annexing Fiji this time than they had been almost two decades earlier.\n\nThe murder of Bishop John Coleridge Patteson of the Melanesian Mission at Nukapu in the Reef Islands had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 Fijians on board the brig \"Carl.\" Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation. The question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, Ma'afu, with both men vacillating for many months.\n\nOn 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the British accepted. On 23 September, Sir Hercules Robinson, soon to be appointed the British Governor of Fiji, arrived on HMS \"Dido\" and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his \"Tui Viti\" title.\n\nThe formal cession took place on 10 October 1874, when Cakobau, Ma'afu, and some of the senior Chiefs of Fiji signed two copies of the Deed of Cession. Thus the Colony of Fiji was founded; 96 years of British rule followed.\n\n"}

Gifford played county cricket for Worcestershire, and Warwickshire County Cricket Clubs, and represented England in fifteen Test matches and two One Day International between 1964 and 1985.\n\nCricket writer Colin Bateman said, \"a spinner who pushed Derek Underwood out of the England side had to be something special, and Norman Gifford was just that. A great competitor with a deep knowledge of the game, 'Giff' could find turn from most surfaces despite firing in his left-arm deliveries\".\n\nKnown to Worcestershire folk as \"Apple Norm\", Gifford served his apprenticeship as a professional cricketer in the Worcestershire second team during 1959, and when in May 1960 he took 2–25 from 18 overs in a drawn Second XI match against Kent, he was called up to the first team for the game against the same opposition that began the very next day. Gifford took four wickets in Kent's first innings, but Worcestershire collapsed to their second-lowest ever score of 25 all out on their way to an innings defeat. In the next game against Cambridge University Gifford took ten wickets in the match, including second-innings analysis of 15.5–7–18–6.\n\nGifford finished 1960 with 41 wickets at an average of 17.90, but this only hinted at the success he was to enjoy the following year. 1961 proved to be the most productive season of Gifford's career as he took 133 wickets. In July 1961, he was notified he was on the long list to tour India and Pakistan with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side, but was not selected for the final party. In compensation he toured Rhodesia and Pakistan with an International XI. He was again fairly successful in the 1962 and 1963 seasons, with 92 and 72 wickets respectively, and in 1962 was selected for the Players in their penultimate match against the Gentlemen before the distinction between amateur and professional cricketers was abolished.\n\n1964 was the year when Gifford really broke through as he was selected for the Second Ashes Test at Lord's in June. Although the game was ruined by rain, with no play at all possible on the first two days, Gifford had time to impress, returning miserly analyses of 12–6–14–2 in the first innings and 17–9–17–1 in the second. He was retained for the Third Test at Headingley, but took only two wickets as Australia recorded a comfortable win. It would be seven years before he played Test cricket again.\n\nWorcestershire's won the County Championship in 1964, and retained their title the following year. Gifford was instrumental in these successes, and although he reached 100 wickets only in 1964, between 1963 and 1968 he averaged under 20 with the ball every season. He took his career-best bowling figures in July 1968 when he took 8–28 (albeit in a losing cause) against Yorkshire.\n\nGifford was recalled to the England team in 1971, replacing Derek Underwood for the Second Test against Pakistan. He was in and out of the team during the next two years, including a tour of the Indian sub-continent in 1972-3.\n\nHe played two more Tests against New Zealand the following summer, but thereafter the selectors' minds turned decisively towards Underwood and Gifford never played Test cricket again. He contented himself with consistent displays in county cricket, leading Worcestershire to another County Championship triumph in 1974, for which he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Later he played for Worcestershire's great rivals Warwickshire, whom he joined for the 1983 season. That year he took 104 first-class wickets, the final time he was to reach the 100 mark.\n\nGifford's England career, however, was not quite over. He made his One Day International debut – extraordinarily as captain – in the absence of David Gower who was being rested, at the age of 44 in the 1984/85 'Rothmans Four-Nations Cup' contest in Sharjah. England lost both their matches, against Australia and Pakistan, but Gifford showed that he still had the ability in the second game when he took 4–23 including the prize wicket of Imran Khan for a first-ball duck. Despite this performance, however, these two games proved to be the extent of Gifford's brief ODI career.\n\nGifford continued to play for Warwickshire into his late forties, and when he retired from playing at the age of 48 in 1988, he had taken 2,068 first-class wickets. The reduction in the amount of first-class cricket played means that he is likely to remain the last man to have broken the 2,000 mark. Never much of a batsman, he made only three half-centuries in more than 800 innings, his 7,000 runs coming at an average of just 13. After retirement, Gifford went into coaching and became coach of first Sussex, and then Durham.\n\nHe is now a scorer for his hometown side, Ulverston C.C. He is still helping to coach youngsters at Worcestershire in 2015, sharing his wealth of knowledge and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1844, Bartow married Louisa Greene Berrien, the daughter of one of his previous professional tutors, Sen. John Berrien. In 1856, Bartow was a candidate for the U.S. Congress but was defeated. The following year, he was elected as captain of Savannah's 21st Oglethorpe Light Infantry, a reserve guard company that had been formed in 1856. He served as an instructor to the volunteers, many of which were young scions of established families in local society.\n\nAs the national controversy over slavery intensified, Bartow became concerned for Georgia's destiny if war became a reality. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln's election, he spurned the Union to advocate the right of secession.\n\nThe Georgia General Assembly summoned delegates to a Secession Convention in Milledgeville which began January 16, 1861—with Bartow nominated for Chatham County's delegation. On May 28, 1861, elections were held to select representatives to the convention, and Bartow emerged as a delegate, along with John W. Anderson and A. S. Jones. Bartow however, was on military duty that day as Governor Joseph E. Brown had previously given orders to retake Fort Pulaski (located near the mouth of the Savannah River)—recently seized by Federal military forces. Brown entrusted the task to Bartow and the Oglethorpe Light Infantry. Bartow's expedition successfully recaptured the fort on June 15, largely due to his artillery under Col. Alexander Lawton.\n\nAt the convention, Bartow stood out as one of the most fervent secessionists. Demanding an immediate withdrawal from the Union, he helped align Georgia among the pro-secessionist states. On January 19, 1861, delegates voted to secede from the Union by a vote of 208 to 89. Bartow was a delegate in favor of secession, voting to sign Georgia's Ordinance of Secession on that day. The actual signing of the ordinance occurred on January 21, 1861, when the delegates ceremoniously signed the document in the public square outside of the state capitol in Milledgeville. Bartow was subsequently chosen to represent Georgia in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States at Montgomery, Alabama, starting February 4, 1861.\n\nOn the second day of the Congress, Bartow became chairman of the Military Committee. He pushed insistently for fast, drastic actions to counter the imminent threat of Northern retaliation. He helped select the color and style of the initial Confederate gray uniforms. During a later session, Bartow announced that he would depart for the battlefront, taking his Oglethorpe Light Infantry up to Virginia. As he explained later on:\n\nBartow telegraphed the news to his Georgia troops, arranging a prompt rally. However, his plans were blocked by Governor Brown, who had already decided to concentrate the state's armed forces strictly for the defense of Georgia. Bartow appealed personally to the Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, using a new law authored by Louis T. Wigfall of Texas that authorized any citizen to offer any voluntary military force directly, without state mediation, to the Confederate President, who would also determine its military leader. Davis immediately approved Bartow's plan and designated him the commander of the new Confederate force, making Bartow's Oglethorpe Light Infantry the first company to officially contribute its services to the Confederacy's national war effort.\n\nAn angry Governor Brown countered by publishing an aggressively tough letter in all Georgia newspapers on May 21, 1861. Among other things, he alleged that Bartow was seeking his own glory by assuring a high command and aspiring to a promotion to colonel. To him, Bartow was actually deserting the war \"to serve the common cause in a more pleasant summer climate.\" He wrote that the muskets Bartow's men had carried to Virginia were exclusively for \"local\" \"public service,\" and that the Governor had the power of disarming the local military companies arbitrarily. He also alleged that Bartow had written the law beforehand, tailoring it for his own plans and forcing Davis to ignore the authority of the Confederacy's \"independent\" states. In Brown's opinion, the governor was Bartow's unique officer by the Confederate Constitution. He argued that the Congress was encroaching Georgia's rights.\n\nNonetheless, Bartow arrived in Savannah on May 21 to assemble his 106 soldiers and to arrange for a train to take them to Virginia's battlefront. A great rally of cheerful citizens congregated at the station, accompanied by the remaining local militia, which fired an artillery salute in Bartow's honor. Before departing, Bartow pronounced to the crowd his most celebrated phrase: \"I go to illustrate Georgia.\"\n\nOn June 14, from Camp Defiance in Harper's Ferry, Bartow wrote his response to the \"insolent missive\" of Brown, who \"thought proper to publish [it] in [Bartow's] absence\". The response was published in the \"Savannah Morning News\". Bartow defended himself vehemently, countering each of the personalized attacks and stating that he had undertaken the current campaign under the sole command of Jefferson Davis. His recurring argument was that the \"Confederate Government is alone chargeable with questions of peace and war and has the exclusive right, excepting in the case of invasion, to raise and maintain armies\" while the Governors are not \"empowered to raise these armies\". Brown would have been committing, \"here again, [his] common error, of supposing that [he was] the State of Georgia ... a mistake in which I do not participate.\"\n\nBartow's 21st Oglethorpe Light Infantry finally arrived in Richmond, Virginia, with the objective of protecting the region from any Union attack. On June 1, 1861, Bartow was promoted to Colonel of the 8th Georgia Infantry, which had been formed in Virginia from companies that had been arriving from different Georgia counties. Later that day, he mustered the regiment for the first time at Camp Bartow in Howard's Grove in Richmond. The regiment was initially assigned to the Shenandoah Valley. Crossing the Virginia Piedmont, it arrived in Winchester, near the northern end of the valley. Once settled, Bartow incorporated some local forces from the 2nd Brigade of the Army of the Shenandoah.\nLate in June 1861, Bartow received orders to move his troops to the outskirts of Manassas to support General P. G. T. Beauregard. They departed on June 19, fording the Shenandoah River with their \"luggage tied on the ends of [their] fixed bayonets.\" After reaching the Piedmont station, the regiment was transported to Manassas by train. \n\nBartow commanded the 7th & 8th Georgia Regiments—the 9th Georgia Regiment, Pope's and Duncan's Kentucky Battalions Infantry remained at Piedmont Station and were not present on July 21, 1861. He addressed his troops, \"... but remember, boys, that battle and fighting mean death, and probably before sunrise, some of us will be dead.\" Early the next morning, Bartow had the 7th and 8th Georgia march to the left flank of the army.\n\nAfter the fighting had started, the two regiments reached Henry House Hill, where they were joined by Bartow, after one of his soldiers confirmed that it was his regiment: \"Boys, what Regiment is this?\" The response came, \"8th Georgia.\" He answered, \"My God, boys, I am mighty glad to see you.\" He deployed his brigade on the hill alongside Brigadier-General Barnard Bee's brigade. Bee then decided to go forward to support Evan's brigade on Matthew Hill as Evans had rejected his suggestion to fall back to Henry Hill. Bartow deployed the 7th and 8th Georgia into line of battle to support the right flank of Bee's Brigade.\n\nAs the hours went on, Bartow's soldiers were gradually worn down by the enemy. At times, they found themselves completely encircled, the target of a spate of bullets. One of the survivors later wrote, \"Practically half of the Eighth's 1,000 Georgians fell dead or wounded, or were captured or lost ... Bartow led his men to an exposed eminence which was too hot to hold.\"\n\nBartow (now with less than 400 men) was forced to retreat about noontime back to his original deployment site. There, he asked General Beauregard, \"What shall now be done? Tell me, and if human efforts can avail, I will do it.\" Waving at the enemy position on the Stone Bridge, Beauregard replied, \"That battery should be silenced.\" Bartow gathered the remainder of the 7th Regiment and launched another attack. Around Henry House Hill, Bartow's horse was shot out from under him and a bullet wounded him slightly. Nonetheless, he grabbed another horse and continued the attack.\n\nAt one point, he harangued his troops to follow him toward the enemy by cheering \"Boys, follow me!\" and waving his cap frantically over his head. Just then, another projectile perforated his chest, fatally lodging in his heart. Some of his soldiers gathered around him, witnessing his last words: \"Boys, they have killed me, but never give up the field.\" Lying on the ground and wrapped in Col. Lucius Gartrell's arms, Francis Bartow died. He was the first brigade commander to be killed in action during the Civil War. (The first general officer to be killed in the war was Confederate Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett at Corrick's Ford, July 13, 1861.) Amos Rucker and his brother Moses Bentley, two body servants from the 7th Regiment, carried Bartow off the battlefield. The renowned surgeon H. V. M. Miller attended him, but without success.\n\nThe rest of Bartow's 7th Georgia continued to obey his last command to attack. The Union forces were beginning to show fatigue, due to their having been weakened during Bartow's morning attack. The Confederates sustained their attack until finally destroying the enemy battery at Stone Bridge. General Beauregard declared, \"You Georgians saved me,\" though the Georgia \"Rome Weekly Courier\" newspaper commented, \"Col. Bartow's fine Regiment of Georgians were nearly annihilated\".\n\nWhen notified of Bartow's death, the Provisional Congress adjourned its sessions \"in testimony of [its] respect for his memory\", as expressed by its spokesman, T. R. R. Cobb. The chamber felt an \"unfeigned sorrow\" due to the \"heavy loss sustained by the Confederacy in the death of one of her most efficient counselors.\" They did confirm Bartow's posthumous rank of acting brigadier general.\n\nOn July 27, 1861, Bartow's corpse returned to Chatham County, Georgia. Accompanied by an extensive popular rally, Bartow was buried at Laurel Grove Cemetery with a military ceremony. Louisa Berrien received a consoling letter from Mrs. Jefferson Davis. His granite monument has two of his historical phrases engraved under a wreath and a saber: \"I go to illustrate Georgia\" and \"They have killed me, boys, but never give up.\"\n\nAfter the battle, on the approximate spot where Bartow was killed, Confederate soldiers placed a small stone landmark (engraved in Savannah) which quoted his last words: \"My God, boys, they have got me, but never give up the field.\" This memorial stone was later removed by Union forces during one of their raids. (Two markers survive on that same site in the present-day National Battlefield—an older one placed by veterans of the 7th Georgia in 1903, and a newer bronze marker erected in the 20th century.)\n\nOn September 4, 1861, before a crowd of 1,000 people, the first Confederate-dedicated monument was inaugurated at Manassas, honoring Francis Bartow. An obelisk made of marble, it was mysteriously stolen in 1862. In 1936, in an attempt to repair this vandalism, a new marker was placed at the same site by the Georgia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A new monument of Bartow exists nearby, several feet from the original one.\n\nAfter years of postponement due to the war and its effects, on February 7, 1890, the Savannah City Council approved erecting a memorial recognizing native sons Francis Bartow and Lafayette McLaws. Unveiled in 1902, their two bronze busts were mounted on stone pedestals at Chippewa Square. Bartow's faced south towards Perry Street, while McLaws' faced north. About 1910, the council decided to build the Oglethorpe Monument at Chippewa Square. Both generals' busts were therefore relocated to the Confederate Monument at Forsyth Park.\n\nBartow is buried in Savannah's Laurel Grove Cemetery.\n\n\nDuring the Civil War, several Georgia companies carried Bartow's name:\n\nThe Francis S. Bartow Camp No. 93 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The Georgia General Assembly recently acknowledged the work of this organization, citing them \"for their role in protecting and preserving Confederate heritage\" (LC 21 7026, House Resolution 1524).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1974991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974991", "title": "100th Infantry Battalion (United States)", "text": "100th Infantry Battalion (United States)\n\nThe 100th Infantry Battalion is the only infantry unit in the United States Army Reserve. In World War II, the then-primarily Nisei battalion was composed largely of former members of the Hawaii Army National Guard. The 100th saw heavy combat during World War II, starting in September 1943 and continuing after being attached as a battalion of the Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team in June 1944. The unit was unofficially nicknamed the Purple Heart Battalion, with the motto \"Remember Pearl Harbor\" and \"Go for Broke\", which was later adopted by other Japanese-American units. \n\nBased at Fort Shafter, Honolulu, Hawaii, the 100th Battalion continues the legacy of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, officially designated as 100th Battalion/442nd Infantry Regiment. The 100th Battalion/442nd Infantry Regiment has maintained an alignment with the active 25th Infantry Division since a reorganization in 1972. This alignment has resulted in the 100th's mobilization for combat duty in the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. The 100th Infantry Battalion is staffed with reservists from Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam and Saipan. In 2014, under the U.S. Army's new \"Associated Units\" program, the 100th Infantry Battalion has been aligned under the Regular Army's 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, under the 25th Infantry Division.\n\nOn the morning of 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, marking the beginning of World War II for the United States. After the attack, Japanese-Americans and those of Japanese descent faced prejudice at home. Chaos ensued in the hours that followed the Pearl Harbor attack, but the 298th and 299th Hawaii National Guard prepared for an invasion, cleared the rubble, donated their blood, and aided the wounded. However, three days after the attack, the units' rifles were stripped from them because of the ethnicity of members; eventually those rifles were returned. Nisei that were a part of the ROTC program at the University of Hawaii were discharged from the Hawaii Territorial Guard. Those former members eventually formed the Varsity Victory Volunteers.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m. martial law was declared, and Governor Joseph Poindexter told President Franklin D. Roosevelt that his greatest fear was sabotage by the large Japanese population in Hawaii. The FBI rounded up known Japanese sympathizers, Buddhist priests, language school principals and teachers, civic and business leaders, fisherman, and instructors of judo and related martial arts. The War Department discharged all soldiers of Japanese ancestry, had all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast rounded up and placed in internment camps around the U S, deactivated of the Hawaii Territorial Guard, and had all Japanese-Americans reclassified as 4-C: enemy aliens.\n\nGeneral Delos Emmons, appointed military governor on 17 December, supported placing Japanese-Americans in internment camps and having them reclassified as enemy aliens, but he wanted to give them a chance to prove their patriotism. After General Emmons agreed to let the Varsity Victory Volunteers form, a confidential memo was sent to the War Department in early April 1942 stating that 2,000 Japanese-American soldiers served, and many more who wished to serve to demonstrate their loyalty to the United States. Their desire was to organize into a fighting force to be sent to Europe or Africa to fight the Germans and Italians, but the request was later denied by the War Department.\n\nAs the Battle of Midway was well underway on 4 June 1942, 1,432 Nisei of the Hawaii National Guard had their weapons taken away and boarded the U.S. Army transport USAT , formerly a Matson liner, under the cover of night and shipped to the mainland without saying goodbye to their family or loved ones. Under the title \"Hawaiian Provisional Infantry Battalion\" the week-long zigzag journey took them to a port in Oakland where they were designated the 100th Infantry Battalion on 12 June 1942. The unit number was an indication of the Army's recently formulated plan for a modern organization for Combat Arms. Under normal prewar Army procedures, all infantry battalions were organic to the regiment they were a part of and were known as, for instance, \"1st Battalion, 5th Regiment.\"\n\nWith the new system of organization, the infantry regiment was reorganized as a headquarters with no organic battalions, but with three separate battalions attached. The headquarters was organized into three combat commands that could be dispatched on separate combat actions with units that were attached. One infantry battalion would be assigned to a combat command, with attachments from the higher headquarters reserve. The 100th, however, was not initially attached to a regiment. It came to be known unofficially as the \"One-Puka-Puka\" (Puka means \"hole\" in Hawaiian).\n\nIn Oakland, the 100th boarded a train to their final destination, Camp McCoy, Wisconsin. Immediately following their arrival to Camp McCoy many of the Nisei felt animosity and distrust from fellow soldiers and military and political leaders. The 100th was quartered in tents, four soldiers per tent, which contained a bunk bed, blanket, towels, and backpack. It would be several months until the Nisei moved into military barracks. Eventually soldiers were permanently placed into military units, such as Companies A through E, and pushed through physical, marksmanship, and tactical training.\n\nSome of the white officers and NCO's appointed to the 100th were schooled in psychology and were ordered to test their physical and military capabilities but most of all their loyalty. The Nisei competed with other companies in marksmanship, baseball, softball, physical combat such as scuffles, boxing, and wrestling.\n\nOn one such occasion that happened to prove the loyalty and bravery of the new recruits, five Nisei soldiers received the Soldier's Medal for their rescue of several local civilians from drowning on a frozen Wisconsin lake.\n\nOn one occasion, about 25 of the Japanese-American soldiers were sent to a secret training mission on a small island, Cat Island, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. Some top military officers thought that the \"Jap\" soldiers smelled differently, and that the Nisei soldiers would give off a similar scent. So for three months these 25 Nisei were ordered to train attack dogs to \"smell Japs.\" The training didn't work.\n\nTraining at Camp McCoy lasted six months until on 6 January 1943 the 100th Battalion was transferred to Camp Shelby, Mississippi. The 100th was attached to the 85th Division under Major General Wade Haislip and would receive even tougher training than they did at Camp McCoy. Upon arrival at Camp Shelby the 100th received the same amount of skepticism as they did at McCoy. The 100th successfully passed the training exercises. At Camp Shelby where 100th received its most intense and advanced training and then was sent to Camp Clairborne, Louisiana for field exercises and war games.\n\nOn return from Camp Clairborne, the 100th met up with the newly formed 442nd Regimental Combat Team on 16 July. On 20 July 1943 the 100th received its battalion colors and motto, \"Remember Pearl Harbor,\" as requested by the unit.\n\nAfter training at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin, and Camp Shelby, Mississippi, the battalion deployed from Shelby on 11 August by train to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey and then to the Mediterranean on 21 August 1943.\n\nThe 100th arrived in Oran, North Africa on 2 September 1943 but was refused by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lieutenant General Mark Wayne Clark, commanding the United States Fifth Army, accepted the offer, and the 100th became a part of the 133rd Infantry Regiment under the 34th Infantry Division and took part in training with Caucasian soldiers. On 19 Division sailed from Africa to southeast of Naples, with the 100th with them.\n\nThe unit were to fight in the Italian Campaign and entered combat on 29 September 1943, near Salerno in Southern Italy. The unit advanced in 24 hours for a week against strong enemy resistance which allowed them to take Benevento, an important rail center and road intersection. The 100th crossed the Volturno River three times, taking on heavy German machine gun fire and rocket launchers before driving the German force even further north.\n\nAt the top of Monte Cassino stood a grand but old monastery, a key target for the 5th Army. To take the Gustav Line, the Allies would have to descend into the Rapido River valley, traverse two miles of open fields filled with landmines, mud, and knee-deep cold water, cross a swift-moving river, and barbed wire and up the steep, rocky slopes, to the 1500-foot peak of Monte Cassino. From there they would have to ascend still higher to a four-story fortress, with 10-foot-thick stone walls. This was the St. Benedictine monastery. The battle commenced in January. Here they earned their nickname the \"Purple Heart Battalion.\" At night, A and C companies passed their way through the river reaching the wall where the enemy was located and held their ground under intense fire into the next day. B Company was met with heavy machine gun fire as their cover by the smoke screen was blown away leaving only 14 of the original 187 men in B Company to reach the wall.\n\nThe three companies were immediately pulled back to San Micheli the next night. The 100th then was ordered to take Castle Hill, which they did on 8 February. The hill was held for four days dealing with not only machine gun fire but tanks as well. The hill was a key location for it was close to the monastery but the 34th Division's right and left flanks were unable to hold their positions because of heavy German resistance. The 100th was again ordered back.\n\nAfter three days of bombing, the second assault commenced. In one platoon of the 100th only five of forty soldiers survived. The 100th again was pulled back into reserve and replaced by British and Indian soldiers after nearly taking Cassino. War correspondents calling the 100th's soldiers \"little men of iron\" and the \"purple heart battalion.\" This would be the last time Nisei of the original 100th would see combat at Monte Cassino as they were taken back to San Michele to rest and reorganize. From that point on, for the rest of the war, replacements from the new volunteer 442nd Regimental Combat Team began filling its ranks.\n\nThere were over 50,000 allied casualties in the battle. Casualties took the 100th's numbers from 1300 5 months prior to nearly 500. Cassino didn't fall until 17 May. After Cassino, the 100th began to receive its first replacements from the 442nd. The battalion was later awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation (later redesignated the Presidential Unit Citation) for its actions on 26–27 June.\n\nFollowing Monte Cassino, the 100th was soon deployed at the Anzio beachhead on 26 March 1944. The allies held a beachhead that spanned inland going a few miles inland. The battlefield at Anzio was very similar to battlefields in World War I as there was a large stretch of land between both opposing forces declared as \"No Man's Land\" and both sides didn't go on a large-scale offensive. The sides only fought at night. During the day, soldiers slept. The fall of Monte Cassino finally led to the end of the stalemate on 17 May 1944. Ont 23 May the allies went on the offensive to drive the Germans north. However, the allies needed more information about the enemy, so the 100th was ordered to capture a German soldier. Lieutenant Young-Oak Kim, a Korean American born in Los Angeles, California, and Nisei PFC Irving Akahoshi from the 100th volunteered for the mission and captured two German soldiers. On the push to Rome, Lanuvio, the final German stronghold, fell to the 100th Infantry Battalion.\n\n\"We had been sitting and living in foxholes at Anzio some 63 days. Then the big push out and the capture of Rome. They (100th Battalion) wiped out the last heavy German resistance we met some 12 miles south of Rome and then it was practically a walk into the city.\"\n\nThe 100th was ordered to stay at the roadside on 4 June 10 kilometers from Rome. They watched other troops march by and never saw Rome. Instead, the 100th was taken northwest of Rome to Civitavecchia where on 11 June 1944, the 100th was attached to the newly arrived 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Because of its combat record, the 100th was allowed to keep their original designation, giving the newly formed all-Nisei fighting unit the name 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team under the 34th Division.\nThe 442nd RCT was inactivated in Honolulu in 1946, but reactivated in 1947 in the U.S. Army Reserve. It was mobilized in 1968 to refill the Strategic Reserve during the Vietnam War, and carries on the honors and traditions of the unit. Today, the 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry, is the only ground combat unit of the Army Reserve. The battalion headquarters is at Fort Shafter, Hawaii, with subordinate units based in Hilo, American Samoa, Saipan, and Guam. The only military presence in American Samoa consists of the battalion's B and C companies.\n\nIn August 2004, the battalion was mobilized for duty in Iraq. Stationed at Logistics Support Area Anaconda in the city of Balad, which is located about 50 miles northwest of Baghdad. Lt. Colonel Colbert Low assumed command of the battalion only a few weeks after the battalion arrived at Logistical Support Area Anaconda. In early 2006, the 100th had returned home. One soldier was killed by an improvised explosive device attack. Four members of the battalion were killed in action, and several dozen injured, before the battalion returned home. During the year-long deployment, one of Charlie Company's attached platoons, discovered over 50 weapons caches. Unlike the soldiers of World War II who were predominantly Japanese Americans, these soldiers came from as far away as Miami, Florida, Tennessee, Alaska and included soldiers from Hawaii, Philippines, Samoa and Palau. For their actions in Iraq the unit received the Meritorious Unit Commendation.\n\nThe unit was once again deployed in 2009. The unit was called up alongside the 3rd brigade, 25th Infantry Division; and was assigned as an element of the 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Nominally deployed to Kuwait, it conducted patrols into Iraq, leading to two fatalities; those patrols consisted of more than a million miles of driving conducting convoy duty. During the units deployment, several dozen of the unit's American Samoan servicemembers became naturalized U.S. citizens while in Kuwait.\n\nThe nation's highest award for combat valor, the Medal of Honor, was conferred upon twenty-one members of the 100th Infantry battalion of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of World War II.\n\nOn 5 October 2010, Congress approved the granting of the Congressional Gold Medal to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion, as well as the 6,000 Japanese Americans who served in the Military Intelligence Service during the war. The Nisei Soldiers of World War II Congressional Gold Medal was collectively presented on November 2, 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the surviving members of the 442nd RCT were made chevaliers of the French Légion d'Honneur for their actions contributing to the liberation of France during World War II and their heroic rescue of the Lost Battalion outside of Biffontaine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Free soloing is the most dangerous form of climbing, and unlike bouldering, free soloists climb above safe heights, where a fall would result in serious injury or death. Though many climbers have attempted free soloing, it is considered \"a niche of a niche\" reserved for the sport's elite, which has led many practitioners to stardom within both the media and the sport of rock climbing. \"Free solo\" was originally a term of climber slang, but after the popularity of the Oscar-winning film \"Free Solo\", Merriam-Webster officially added the word to the English dictionary in September 2019.\n\nMany climbing communities praise the ascents, while others have concerns regarding the danger involved and the message the ascents potentially send to other climbers. Many companies have taken these views into account when working with free soloists. Clif Bar, the nutrition bar company with long ties to climbing, dropped the sponsorship of five climbers in 2014, citing the risks they take and stirring a debate about how much risk should be rewarded. \n\nHowever, The North Face and Red Bull have promoted free soloists and helped the free soloing community grow. In addition, Alex Honnold, a free soloist who was previously dropped by Clif Bar, was featured in the 2018 documentary \"Free Solo\", which was met with critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nHigh-profile climbers have cited simplicity and speed with which one can climb as reasons for free soloing, as well as the intense concentration required which brings a Zen-like state of being in the moment. The most successful free soloists also become well known in the climbing community and in rare cases attain notoriety outside the small circle of rock climbers.\n\nThe practice is mostly confined to routes familiar to the climber, whose difficulty lies well within the climber's abilities. However, inherent risks such as loose rocks or sudden change in weather are always present. Some high-profile climbers have died while free soloing, including John Bachar, Derek Hersey, Vik Hendrickson, Robert Steele, Dwight Bishop, Jimmy Ray Forester, Jimmy Jewell, Tony Wilmott, and John Taylor.\n\nThe sport has produced a number of well-known practitioners, made famous by photos of them totally alone and unprotected on sheer cliffs. In June 2017, Alex Honnold made international news with the first free-solo ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite, on a route rated 5.13a in the Yosemite Decimal System.\n\nSome climbers who are known for their regular practice of free solo climbing include: Hansjörg Auer, Jim Erickson, John Bachar, Patrick Berhault, Thomas Bubendorfer, Matt Bush, Renaldo Clarke, Peter Croft, Steph Davis, Bill Denz, Tim Deroehn, Catherine Destivelle, Patrick Edlinger, Eric Escoffier, John Gill, Brad Gobright, Dan Goodwin, Mike Graham, Wolfgang Güllich, Colin Haley, Derek Hersey, Alex Honnold, Alexander Huber, Jimmy Jewell, Eric Jones, Kevin Jorgeson, Matt Lloyd, Dave MacLeod, Dan Osman, Dean Potter, Paul Preuss, Andreas Proft, Herbert Ranggetiner, Michael Reardon, Alain Robert, Tobin Sorenson, Will Stanhope, Ueli Steck, Slavko Svetičič, Miroslav Šmíd, Akihira Tawara, John Yablonski, Maurizio Zanolla, Jim Reynolds.\n\nSome climbers who have occasionally or rarely free soloed, but have been influential to the practice, include: Pierre Allain, Henry Barber, Lynn Hill, Ron Kauk, Jean-Christophe Lafaille, John Long, Dave MacLeod, Reinhold Messner.\n\nThere are few climbers who have free solo climbed in the 5.14 grade range. This list does not include \"highball\" boulder ascents because the climbers here did not use any padding or spotters. There is some debate on the blurred line between \"highball\" bouldering and short free solo climbs.\n\nSome free soloists scale buildings: Alain Robert (\"The French Spider-Man\"), and Dan Goodwin (\"Skyscraperman\"), have scaled dozens of skyscrapers around the world—a sport known as buildering—without any safety equipment.\n\n\nDifferent types of climbing include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1975043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975043", "title": "The Long Ships (film)", "text": "The Long Ships (film)\n\nThe Long Ships is a 1964 Anglo–Yugoslav adventure film shot in Technirama directed by Jack Cardiff and stars Richard Widmark, Sidney Poitier and Russ Tamblyn.\n\nThe film was very loosely based on the Swedish novel \"The Long Ships\" by Frans G. Bengtsson (1941–1945), retaining little more than the title (of the English translation) and the Moorish settings of Orm's first voyage. Although the protagonist is named Rolfe, the film was released in Sweden with the title \"Röde Orm och de långa skeppen\" (Red Orm and the Long Ships), in a further attempt to exploit the popularity of the novel. It was also intended to capitalise on the success of recent Viking and Moorish dramas such as \"The Vikings\" (1958) and \"El Cid\" (1961) and was later followed by \"Alfred the Great\" (1969).\n\nThe story centres on an immense golden bell named the Mother of Voices, which may or may not exist. Moorish king Aly Mansuh (Sidney Poitier) is convinced that it does. Having collected all the legendary material about it that he can, he plans to mount an expedition to search for it. When a shipwrecked Norseman, Rolfe (Richard Widmark), repeats the story of the bell in the marketplace, and hints that he knows its location, he is seized by Mansuh's men and brought in for questioning. Rolfe insists that he does not know more than the legend itself and that the bell is most likely only a myth. He manages to escape by jumping through a window before the questioning continues under torture.\n\nAfter swimming back to return home, Rolfe reveals to his father Krok and his brother Orm that he did indeed hear the bell pealing on the night his ship was wrecked in Africa. However, Rolfe's father has been made destitute after spending a fortune building a funeral ship for the Danish king, Harald Bluetooth, who then refuses to reimburse him by citing an outstanding debt. Rationalising that the ship does not yet belong to Harald (since he is still living), Rolfe and Orm steal not only the ship, but hire a number of inebriated Vikings to serve as its crew. In order to prevent Harald from killing his father in revenge for the theft, he also takes the king's daughter as a hostage. Harald declares that he will summon every longship he can find and rescue her.\n\nSince the ship was intended as a funeral ship, the crew begins to get superstitious and demands to return home. Rolfe asks the ship's captain what's the way to sway the bad luck off them, and he states that a maiden must be sacrificed to the gods. He pretends to do so (he stabs himself in the foot to draw blood) and later reveals the trick to the crew. After prolonged difficulties at sea, the ship is damaged in a maelstrom, and the Norse are cast ashore in a Moorish shore. After getting attacked and captured by the Moors, the Norse are condemned to execution, where Mansuh reencounters Rolfe and again demands to know where the Mother of Voices is. Mansuh's favourite wife Aminah (Rosanna Schiaffino) convinces her husband to use them and their longship to retrieve the bell. After they sail to the Pillars of Hercules, Rolfe and Mansuh find only a domed chapel with a small bronze bell where the Viking was certain he had heard the Mother of Voices. Frustrated, Rolfe throws the hanging bell against a wall, and the resounding cacophony reveals that the chapel dome itself is the disguised Mother of Voices.\n\nAfter a costly misadventure topples the Mother of Voices from its clifftop down to the sea, the expedition finally returns to the Moorish city, Aly Mansuh triumphantly riding through the streets with the bell in tow. However, King Harald and his men, including Krok, out to rescue the princess, have since conquered the city, and upon Aly Mansuh's arrival they leap out of hiding. The climactic battle ensues, and ends when the bell falls over and crushes Aly Mansuh; the Moors are defeated and the Vikings victorious. The film ends with Rolfe trying his best to persuade King Harald to mount another expedition for the \"three crowns of the Saxon kings\", much to Krok's amusement.\n\n\nBruce Geller wrote the first draft of the script. Irving Allen announced he would make it for a budget of £2 million (US$5.6 million).\n\nThe film was originally meant to be directed by José Ferrer, who had made \"The Cockleshell Heroes\" for Irwin Allen. Ferrer said he was looking for \"a Burt Lancaster type and a Tony Curtis type and two girls\" for the lead. He was not intending to act in the film. However, Ferrer dropped out and was replaced by Jack Cardiff; Richard Widmark was signed to star.\n\nThe film was to be shot in Yugoslavia. George Peppard claimed he turned down a lead role despite a fee of $200,000 because he did not want to spend six months in that country.\n\n\"It is obvious that Tito's government is anxious to see more and more foreign filmmakers come to Yugoslavia\", said Allen. \"And of course it is also in the best interests of the American and British governments to encourage anything that improves Yugoslavia's financial independence from the Soviet bloc. I'm sure Belgrade will soon catch up with London and Rome.\"\n\nFilming took place on Avala Hill.\n\nThe American Legion condemned the production of the film – along with another Hollywood financed film shot in Yugoslavia, \"Lancelot and Guinevere\" – as \"immoral, deceptive, unethical and detrimental to the best interests of the United States and the free world.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a happy time\", said Widmark of the shoot.\n\nThe film performed very well in the United Kingdom, grossing $840,000. In the US and Canada it earned rentals of $1,930,000.\n\n\n"}

Each act and resolution of Congress is originally published as a slip law, which is classified as either public law (abbreviated Pub.L.) or private law (Pvt.L.), and designated and numbered accordingly. At the end of a Congressional session, the statutes enacted during that session are compiled into bound books, known as \"session law\" publications. The session law publication for U.S. Federal statutes is called the \"United States Statutes at Large\". In that publication, the public laws and private laws are numbered and organized in chronological order. U.S. Federal statutes are published in a three-part process, consisting of slip laws, session laws (\"Statutes at Large\"), and codification (\"United States Code\").\n\nLarge portions of public laws are enacted as amendments to the United States Code. Once enacted into law, an Act will be published in the \"Statutes at Large\" and will add to, modify, or delete some part of the United States Code. Provisions of a public law that contain only enacting clauses, effective dates, and similar matters are not generally codified. Private laws also are not generally codified.\n\nSome portions of the United States Code have been enacted as positive law and other portions have not been so enacted. In case of a conflict between the text of the \"Statutes at Large\" and the text of a provision of the United States Code that has not been enacted as positive law, the text of the \"Statutes at Large\" takes precedence.\n\nPublication of the \"United States Statutes at Large\" began in 1845 by the private firm of Little, Brown and Company under authority of a joint resolution of Congress. During Little, Brown and Company's time as publisher, Richard Peters (Volumes 1–8), George Minot (Volumes 9–11), and George P. Sanger (Volumes 11–17) served as editors.\n\nIn 1874, Congress transferred the authority to publish the \"Statutes at Large\" to the Government Printing Office under the direction of the Secretary of State.\n\n, 61 Stat. 633, was enacted July 30, 1947 and directed the Secretary of State to compile, edit, index, and publish the \"Statutes at Large\". , 64 Stat. 980, was enacted September 23, 1950 and directed the Administrator of General Services to compile, edit, index, and publish the \"Statutes at Large\". Since 1985 the \"Statutes at Large\" have been prepared and published by the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\n\nUntil 1948, all treaties and international agreements approved by the United States Senate were also published in the set, but these now appear in a publication titled \"United States Treaties and Other International Agreements\", abbreviated U.S.T. In addition, the \"Statutes at Large\" includes the text of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, amendments to the Constitution, treaties with Native American nations and foreign nations, and presidential proclamations.\n\nSometimes very large or long Acts of Congress are published as their own \"appendix\" volume of the \"Statutes at Large\". For example, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was published as volume 68A of the \"Statutes at Large\" ().\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1975057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975057", "title": "George Horton", "text": "George Horton\n\nGeorge Horton (October 11, 18591942) was a member of the United States diplomatic corps who held several consular offices in Greece and the Ottoman Empire between 1893 and 1924. During two periods he was the U.S. Consul or Consul General at Smyrna (known as Izmir, Turkey today), 1911–1917 and 1919–1922. The first ended when the U.S. entered World War I and diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire were terminated. The second covered Greek administration of the city during the Greco-Turkish War. The Greek administration of Smyrna was appointed by the Allied Powers following Turkey's defeat in World War I and the seizure of Smyrna.\n\nToday Horton is best remembered for \"The Blight of Asia\", his 1926 book about the events, notably the systematic ethnic cleansing of the Christian population, leading up to and during the Great Fire of Smyrna. He briefly summarizes events from 1822 to 1909 and covers in more detail, with eye-witness accounts, events from 1909 to 1922. The title refers to what he considered the abominable behavior of the Ottoman Turks. Horton, in his book records his personal memoirs from life in modern-day-Turkey, while the events he describes are focused on that particular region, and that particular time. The book has been criticised as anti-Turkish by a number of scholars and Horton himself accused of bias against Turks and Muslims.\n\nGeorge Horton was born on October 11, 1859 in Fairville in Wayne County, New York. In 1909, Horton married Catherine Sakopoulos and they had one daughter, Nancy Horton.\n\nHorton was a literary person. He was a scholar of both Greek and Latin. He translated Sappho, wrote a guide for the interpretation of Scripture, and published several novels. He was also a renowned journalist in Chicago, a party in the so-called Chicago Renaissance.\n\nHorton started his career as a literary journalist, first as literary editor of the \"Chicago Times-Herald\" (1899–1901), then as editor of the literary supplement of the \"Chicago American\" (1901–1903).\n\nHorton was also both a professional diplomat and a lover of Greece or Philhellene. He became U.S. Consul in Athens in 1893, where he actively promoted the revival of the Olympic Games and inspired the U.S. team's participation. He wrote a lyrical visitor's guide to Athens and composed a reflective description of his stay in Argolis.\n\nHorton served as U.S. Consul in Athens 1893-1898 and 1905–1906. He was US Consul General in Saloniki 1910–1911.\n\nHe then served as U.S. Consul in Smyrna 1911–1917, up to the termination of diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire in World War I (American entry into World War I). He served again after the war from 1919 until the Great Fire began on September 13, 1922, spending the last hours before his own evacuation signing passes for those entitled to American protection and transportation to Piraeus.\n\nToday Horton is most remembered for his 1926 book \"The Blight of Asia\" which centers on the destruction of Smyrna. The fire ravaged Smyrna starting on September 13, 1922; Horton departed his Consul General's post there on the evening of that day. The fire lasted for 4 days.\n\nBefore publication Horton had resigned his diplomatic commission, and he wrote strictly in the capacity of a private citizen, drawing on his own observations and those of the people he quoted. \nHis account remains as controversial as the fire itself.\n\nHis account of the forced exodus of Christian inhabitants (Greek and Armenian), by Ottoman Turkish soldiers, chronicles the latter stages of the genocide of Asia Minor's native Christian population.\n\nHorton quotes numerous contemporary communications including eyewitness accounts of the massacre of Phocaea in 1914, by a Frenchman, and the Armenian massacres of 1914/15, by an American citizen and by a German missionary. He also published letters that he received at the consulate from Americans living in Smyrna and radio messages that he received while traveling by ship from Smyrna to Athens, which recorded how many lives were being saved by the British Navy.\n\nAccording to James L. Marketos, Horton wanted his book to make four main points.\n\nFirst, he wanted to illustrate that the catastrophic events in Smyrna were merely \"the closing act in a consistent program of exterminating Christianity throughout the length and breadth of the old Byzantine Empire.\"\n\nSecond, he wanted to establish that the Smyrna fire was started by regular Turkish army troops with, as he put it, \"fixed purpose, with system, and with painstaking minute details.\"\n\nThird, he wanted to emphasize that the Allied Powers shamefully elevated their selfish political and economic interests over the plight of the beleaguered Christian populations of Asia Minor, thereby allowing the Smyrna catastrophe to unfold without any effective resistance and, as he said, \"without even a word of protest by any civilized government.\"\n\nAnd fourth, he wanted to illustrate that pious western Christians were deluded in thinking they were making missionary headway in the Muslim world.\n\nTurkish historian Biray Kolluoğlu Kırlı, in an article published by the Oxford University Press, has written that \"George Horton['s] anti-Turkish bias is crudely explicit\". This view is shared by Professor Emeritus Peter M. Buzanski, who attributed Horton's anti-Turkish stance to his well-known \"fanatic\" philhellenism and his wife being Greek and wrote \"During the Turkish capture of Smyrna, at the end of the Greco-Turkish War, Horton suffered a breakdown, resigned from the diplomatic service, and spent the balance of his life writing anti-Turkish, pro-Greek books.\" Scholar David Roessel shares a similar view, noting that except for his laments about materialism and the Great War, \"Horton reverted to the philhellenic and anti-Turkish rhetoric\" in his book.\n\nAnother criticism of his work was by Brian Coleman:\n\nGeorge Horton was a man of letters and United States Consul in Greece and Turkey at a time of social and political change. He writes of the re-taking of Smyrna by the Turkish army in September 1922. His account, however, goes beyond the blame and events to a demonization of Muslims, in general, and of Turks, in particular. In several of his novels, written more than two decades before the events of September 1922, he had already identified the Turk as the stock-in-trade villain of Western civilization. In his account of Smyrna, he writes not as historian, but as publicist.\n\n\"The New York Times\" of September 21 carried a story from Athens attributed to the Associated Press, reporting Horton's account of events in Smyrna. It opened in quotation marks with \"the manner in which\" he had summarized for the AP: \"During my consulship at Saloniki I was bombed by Bulgars and Germans and during my official career I have had many rough experiences with submarines and fire, but never in my life have I seen anything like the Smyrna catastrophe.\"\n\nHorton's November arrival in New York City was covered by \"The New York Times\" primarily in regard to his transport for the American Archaeological Society of thirty gold coins found at Sardis. They were believed to be minted for Croesus, and to represent the earliest coinage of gold anywhere. The story introduced him as \"Dr. George Horton, United States Consul General at Smyrna, where he witnessed the burning and sacking of the ancient seaport and the evacuation of 40,000 refugees in five days  ...\" and closed with two paragraphs on Smyrna service, including recent personal loss of property and upcoming consultation in Washington concerning missing Americans.\n\nDuring the Smyrna catastrophe, Turkish military officer Nureddin Pasha had turned Metropolitan Chrysostomos over to an angry mob. The bishop was barbarically beaten, mutilated and killed. Horton reportedly said,\n\nI have known Monsigneur Chrysostomos for years. He was an active and enthusiastic exponent of Greek ambitions and ideals which it seems to me was quite natural in him as a Greek ... Greeks set him down in their history as a hero and martyr.\n\n\n\n"}

The first day of the Republican Party's convention fell on Labor Day, the last day of the popular Minnesota State Fair, though because of Hurricane Gustav, this day was mostly a call for action to help victims and formal, required activities; most of the politicking and partying did not start until Tuesday, the second scheduled day.\n\nThis was the latest any major party convention has ever been convened, and the first one to take place entirely in September. Traditionally, the party who holds the White House has the opportunity to select the date of its convention second, and normally the challenging party holds their convention in July while the incumbent party holds its convention in August. This year, later dates were chosen for both conventions because the parties wanted to schedule their conventions after the 2008 Summer Olympics ended.\n\nPresident George W. Bush did not attend the convention (although he did appear by satellite), in order to oversee relief efforts to help citizens recover from Hurricane Gustav. The attending delegates at the convention nominated Senator John McCain from Arizona for president and Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska for vice president. 1,191 pledged delegates were necessary for candidates to win the respective nominations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour cities made bids to the Republican National Committee (RNC) for proposals to host the 2008 Convention. Those cities were Cleveland, Ohio, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, New York City, New York, and Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida. The RNC Selection Committee made its recommendation for Minneapolis-Saint Paul and on September 27, 2006, the RNC made its decision public that the 2008 Republican National Convention would be held in Minneapolis-Saint Paul. The RNC made their decision earlier than originally scheduled because the Democratic National Committee (DNC) also had Minneapolis-Saint Paul as a finalist among bidding cities. (After the RNC's selection, the DNC removed Minneapolis-Saint Paul from consideration which left the DNC with only two cities to choose from: New York City and Denver, Colorado.) This is the second time the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area held the Republican National Convention—the first was held in 1892.\n\nThe 27 electoral college votes from Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa as a block—equal in value to Florida's—was judged by the University of Minnesota Elections project to be subject to swing toward either major party. Even so, Minnesota has not gone to the Republicans since the 1972 election when during his reelection President Richard Nixon won every state except Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. In 1984, during his reelection, President Ronald Reagan was victorious over Minnesota's \"favorite son,\" Walter Mondale, in all states except Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.\n\nSince the U.S. Constitution limits the president to two terms and vice president Dick Cheney did not seek the presidency, the 2008 election was the first election in which neither the sitting president nor the sitting vice president sought his party's nomination since 1928 (when neither the sitting president, Calvin Coolidge, nor the sitting vice president, Charles G. Dawes, chose to seek the presidency) and the first since 1952 where neither the sitting president nor sitting vice president received his party's nomination (when the sitting president, Harry S. Truman, chose not to seek reelection and the sitting vice president, Alben Barkley, lost the Democratic Nomination to Adlai Stevenson). With the exception of the 1964 convention, which nominated Barry Goldwater for president and William E. Miller for vice-president, this was the first convention since 1948 not to feature a man named either Nixon, Dole or Bush on the ticket.\n\nSarah Palin, nominated for vice president, became the first female on the Republican presidential ticket.\n\nConsidering the signs that were waved by the delegates, the dominant message of the convention was \"Country First.\" The \"U.S.A.!\" chant was also a part of the message of the convention with the delegates chanting it during Lieberman's and Thompson's speeches on the first evening.\n\nWith the landfall of Hurricane Gustav on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the White House canceled the planned appearances of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Rick Perry of Texas skipped the convention to remain in their states during the hurricane's landfall. The Monday, September 1, 2008, schedule was compressed to two hours from seven. McCain called on the party to reduce partisan activities ahead of the hurricane's arrival. The Republican Party chartered a DC-9 to fly convention delegates representing the affected areas back home to their families. The last time a major hurricane struck in a Presidential-election year was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which hit South Florida four days after the Republican Convention in Houston, Texas.\n\nOn March 26, 2008, the National Football League and NBC agreed to move the kickoff time of a September 4 season-opening football game to 7:00 p.m. EDT instead of 8:30 p.m. EDT to accommodate the convention. The game ended relatively on time, at 10:01 p.m. EDT, with NBC Sports handing off to NBC News within moments of the end of the game. According to Nielsen Media Research, 38.9 million Americans watched McCain deliver his acceptance speech—a half million more than tuned in to see Obama the previous week.\n\nTo be selected as the 2008 Republican Party Nominee, a candidate must have received the vote of 1,191 delegates. As of March 4, 2008, McCain had received the pledges of more than 1,191 delegates. Although most of those delegates were \"not\" required to vote for him, on September 3, 2008, McCain won the nomination almost unanimously.\n\nPalin was nominated for vice president by voice vote on September 4, 2008.\n\nSeveral early predictions made by the National Hurricane Center showed Minneapolis-St. Paul on the predicted ground track of Hurricane Gustav. Gustav would have long been extra-tropical by the time it reached the area, it could have caused a significant impact to the convention due to rain. Most of the convention's activities were curtailed as Gustav neared, and President Bush canceled his plans to attend the convention. As the hurricane moved inland, its track shifted well to the east missing the area by several hundred miles.\n\nApproximately 10,000 largely peaceful protesters marched against the war in Iraq and 2,000 more to end homelessness and poverty. They represented a number of organizations opposed to the Republican Administration including the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, Veterans for Peace, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Military Families Speak Out, the Teamsters, Code Pink, the American Indian Movement and the RNC Welcoming Committee. About 1,000 people in place for the third major march, and the last to be sanctioned, were stopped on Thursday, September 4, 2008, by police because they attempted to begin their march after the time their march permit expired. The Anti-War Committee, which supports nonviolent action and civil disobedience and had cooperated with anarchist groups, had organized and publicized the march to protest at the time of McCain's acceptance speech, which was in violation of the court-approved protest permit time.\nRon Paul's Campaign for Liberty and 10,000 Ron Paul supporters attended the \"Rally for the Republic\", a protest convention on September 2, 2008, held a few miles from the Xcel Energy Center at the Minneapolis Target Center in direct contrast to the Republican National Convention.\n\nSeveral groups had been preparing to protest near the convention.\nIn early January 2008, protesters marched from the Minnesota State Capitol to the Xcel Energy Center in hopes of securing a protest permit. The Saint Paul Police Department authorized the event, but only approved the permit through July 2008. On February 8 and February 9, 2008, antiwar protesters attended a weekend conference at the University of Minnesota to discuss the protests and antiwar rally. On February 28, 2008, the Associated Press (AP) reported that the police department adopted new guidelines for the investigation of protest groups. The police department said that this did not have anything to do with the convention.\n\nIn early March 2008, the city of Saint Paul gave the first permits to protest organizers. The city had said that it was not going to follow the \"New York model\" for protest security, referring to the tactics the New York City Police Department used for the 2004 Republican National Convention protest activity. Later, on March 24, 2008, the antiwar group the \"Coalition to March on the RNC and Stop the War\", sued the city, claiming their free speech and due process rights were denied by the vagueness of the permits which did not specify a permitted route for their march. On July 16, 2008, a Federal judge upheld the terms of the permit. And when the time came on September 2, 2008, police led the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign for two hours on a trek away from the convention which had been less than from their starting point.\n\nBefore the convention began, search warrants were executed by Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Six persons who were a part of the organizing group, the RNC Welcoming Committee, were arrested when police executed search warrants on a handful of homes in Minneapolis and Saint Paul during the weekend preceding the convention.\n\nMedia outlets reported on several of the searches. Given the nature of the probable cause for the warrant applications, a district court judge authorized no-knock warrants. Police entered the homes wearing body armor with weapons drawn, which is standard for no-knock warrants. RNC Welcoming Committee members detained at the group's headquarters, located in an old theater on Saint Paul's West Side, were ultimately arrested by Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher of misdemeanor fire code violations.\n\nOn the first day of the convention, a group of protesters stood in front of approximately 30 to 40 delegates from Connecticut in an attempt to prevent them from entering the convention. Paramedics had to treat an 83-year-old member of the delegation for breathing problems when his credentials were ripped from his neck by a protester. Additionally, a black bloc smashed windows of downtown businesses and slashed the tires several police cars, lit one police car on fire, and used a garbage dumpster as a battering ram against another. About 12 protesters were arrested.\nDuring the convention's first three days, more than 300 individuals were detained by police, including journalists, healthcare workers, and legal observers. Some were released, but nearly half received felony charges. Of these felony arrests, many cases were dropped or reviewed, sometimes for lesser charges, and about 21 were found to be prosecutable. About 102 persons were arrested for unlawful assembly at a Rage Against the Machine concert in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nOver the four days of the convention, more than 30 journalists were arrested while reporting on the protests. The arrests included journalists from national organizations such as AP and \"Democracy Now!\", journalists from local radio and TV stations, as well as university journalism students and advisors.\n\nThree journalists from \"Democracy Now!\"—including principal host Amy Goodman—were detained by police during their reporting on the protests. According to a press release by \"Democracy Now!\", Goodman was arrested after confronting officers regarding the arrest of her colleagues. The officers were in the midst of crowd control, and ordered Goodman to move back. She was arrested after refusing the officer's orders. All were held on charges of \"probable cause for riot\". Several news sources have criticized the arrest as unlawful and a violation of the freedom of the press, and warned of the \"chilling effects\" of such measures. Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman and producers Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar\nprevailed in a lawsuit against the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul and the U.S. Secret Service\nbrought by the Center for Constitutional Rights, attorney Steven Reiss from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP in New York, and Albert Goins of Minneapolis. The federal lawsuit asserted that the government cannot, in the name of security, limit the flow of information by intimidating and arresting journalists who engage in constitutionally protected reporting on speech protected by the First Amendment, such as dissent or law enforcement activities. The settlement included compensation of $100,000 for the three journalists and an agreement by the St. Paul Police Department to implement a training program aimed at educating officers regarding the First Amendment rights of the press and public with respect to police operations — including police handling of media coverage of mass demonstrations — and to pursue implementation of the training program in Minneapolis and statewide.\n\nThe final protest march was permitted for 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on the final day of the convention. This meant that the last of the marchers needed to be back on capitol grounds by 5 p.m. By 4 p.m., the march had still not left the capitol grounds. Understanding that the protesters were interested in being near the Xcel Energy Center when delegates were, police offered a compromise: march leaders were told that if they started their march before 5 p.m., police would allow it to continue past the permit time. March organizers refused. When the final protest march permit expired at 5 p.m., overpasses over Interstate 94 leading into downtown from the state capitol were closed. Two hours later, when the final assembly permit on capitol grounds expired and protesters refused several commands to disperse, police used tear gas, smoke bombs, pepper spray, flash bangs, mounted police, paint marker rounds, and rubber bullets to prevent an antiwar march organized by the Anti-War Committee to march on the Xcel Energy center. This march would have been in violation of the court-approved march permits. Between 300 and 400 people were arrested or held including 19 journalists, among them AP reporters Amy Forliti and Jon Krawczynski, reporters from \"Twin Cities Daily Planet\" and \"The Uptake\", and Paul Demko of \"The Minnesota Independent\". Total arrests of convention protesters numbered approximately 800, although only 15 cases resulted in criminal charges. Several suits were started in U.S. District Court, claiming civil rights abuses by the St. Paul Police Department and other agencies involved in the RNC, particularly the Minneapolis Police Department and Ramsey County Sheriff's Office. Search warrants were still being granted into 2009 in relation to the events that transpired during the 2008 RNC.\n\n\nBoth McKay and Crowder were arrested based on FBI surveillance and testimony by former-activist turned informant, Brandon Michael Darby and Andrew C. Darst, also known as \"Panda,\" \"warchyld\" or Killswitch. Darst is currently being charged in Ramsey County, MN, with two felony counts of first- and second-degree burglary as well as fifth-degree assault relating to a January 11, 2009, domestic disturbance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1975073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975073", "title": "Aquatic ecosystem", "text": "Aquatic ecosystem\n\nAn aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem in a body of water. Communities of organisms that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems. \n\nMarine ecosystems, the largest of all ecosystems, cover approximately 71% of the Earth's surface and contain approximately 97% of the planet's water. They generate 32% of the world's net primary production. They are distinguished from freshwater ecosystems by the presence of dissolved compounds, especially salts, in the water. Approximately 85% of the dissolved materials in seawater are sodium and chlorine. Seawater has an average salinity of 35 parts per thousand of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.\n\nMarine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The oceanic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live. The benthic zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The intertidal zone is the area between high and low tides; in this figure it is termed the littoral zone. Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include estuaries, salt marshes, coral reefs, lagoons and mangrove swamps. In the deep water, hydrothermal vents may occur where chemosynthetic sulfur bacteria form the base of the food web.\n\nClasses of organisms found in marine ecosystems include brown algae, dinoflagellates, corals, cephalopods, echinoderms, and sharks. Fishes caught in marine ecosystems are the biggest source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.\n\nEnvironmental problems concerning marine ecosystems include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example overfishing of certain species), marine pollution, climate change, and building on coastal areas.\n\nFreshwater ecosystems cover 0.78% of the Earth's surface and inhabit 0.009% of its total water. They generate nearly 3% of its net primary production. Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species.\n\nThere are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems:\n\nLake ecosystems can be divided into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure). The first, the littoral zone, is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur. The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone. In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them. In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones. Some systems use other names. The off shore areas may be called the pelagic zone, the photic zone may be called the limnetic zone and the aphotic zone may be called the profundal zone. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a riparian zone which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.\n\nWetlands can be part of the lentic system, as they form naturally along most lake shores, the width of the wetland and littoral zone being dependent upon the slope of the shoreline and the amount of natural change in water levels, within and among years. Often dead trees accumulate in this zone, either from windfalls on the shore or logs transported to the site during floods. This woody debris provides important habitat for fish and nesting birds, as well as protecting shorelines from erosion.\n\nTwo important subclasses of lakes are ponds, which typically are small lakes that intergrade with wetlands, and water reservoirs. Over long periods of time, lakes, or bays within them, may gradually become enriched by nutrients and slowly fill in with organic sediments, a process called succession. When humans use the watershed, the volumes of sediment entering the lake can accelerate this process. The addition of sediments and nutrients to a lake is known as eutrophication.\n\nPonds are small bodies of freshwater with shallow and still water, marsh, and aquatic plants. They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film. The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. Food webs are based both on free-floating algae and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators. Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding. Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as vernal pools. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.\n\nThe major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.\n\nWetlands are dominated by vascular plants that have adapted to saturated soil. There are four main types of wetlands: swamp, marsh, fen and bog (both fens and bogs are types of mire). Wetlands are the most productive natural ecosystems in the world because of the proximity of water and soil. Hence they support large numbers of plant and animal species. Due to their productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with dykes and drains and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds. Their closeness to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement. Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding. The Louisiana coast around New Orleans is a well-known example; the Danube Delta in Europe is another.\n\nAquatic ecosystems perform many important environmental functions. For example, they recycle nutrients, purify water, attenuate floods, recharge ground water and provide habitats for wildlife. Aquatic ecosystems are also used for human recreation, and are very important to the tourism industry, especially in coastal regions.\n\nThe health of an aquatic ecosystem is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem can be a result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen consuming materials, and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems. There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine. The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species. Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.\n\nAn ecosystem is composed of biotic communities that are structured by biological interactions and abiotic environmental factors. Some of the important abiotic environmental factors of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow. It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments. There may be complicated feedback loops. For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.\n\nThe amount of dissolved oxygen in a water body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping. Plants often have to produce aerenchyma, while the shape and size of leaves may also be altered. Conversely, oxygen is fatal to many kinds of anaerobic bacteria.\n\nNutrient levels are important in controlling the abundance of many species of algae. The relative abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can in effect determine which species of algae come to dominate. Algae are a very important source of food for aquatic life, but at the same time, if they become over-abundant, they can cause declines in fish when they decay. Similar over-abundance of algae in coastal environments such as the Gulf of Mexico produces, upon decay, a hypoxic region of water known as a dead zone.\n\nThe salinity of the water body is also a determining factor in the kinds of species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The degree of salinity in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of wetland (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species. Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.\n\nFreshwater used for irrigation purposes often absorbs levels of salt that are harmful to freshwater organisms.\n\nThe biotic characteristics are mainly determined by the organisms that occur. For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there. For example, many wetland plants must produce aerenchyma to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic characteristics are more subtle and difficult to measure, such as the relative importance of competition, mutualism or predation. There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.\n\nAutotrophic organisms are producers that generate organic compounds from inorganic material. Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments. The more shallow the water, the greater the biomass contribution from rooted and floating vascular plants. These two sources combine to produce the extraordinary production of estuaries and wetlands, as this autotrophic biomass is converted into fish, birds, amphibians and other aquatic species.\n\nChemosynthetic bacteria are found in benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on hydrogen sulfide in water that comes from volcanic vents. Great concentrations of animals that feed on these bacteria are found around volcanic vents. For example, there are giant tube worms (\"Riftia pachyptila\") 1.5 m in length and clams (\"Calyptogena magnifica\") 30 cm long.\n\nHeterotrophic organisms consume autotrophic organisms and use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials to create their own biomass. Euryhaline organisms are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while stenohaline or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1975104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975104", "title": "UCLA School of Law", "text": "UCLA School of Law\n\nThe UCLA School of Law, also referred to as UCLA Law, is one of 12 professional schools at the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA Law has been consistently ranked by \"U.S. News & World Report\" as one of the top 20 law schools in the United States since the inception of the \"U.S. News\" rankings in 1987. Its 17,000 alumni include more judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit than any other law school, as well as leaders in private law practice, government service, the judiciary, sports and entertainment law, and public interest law. As part of a renowned public university, the school's mission is to provide an excellent legal education while expanding access to the legal professional to those who otherwise would not be able to pursue a legal degree. The dean of the school is Jennifer L. Mnookin., an evidence scholar who joined the UCLA Law faculty in 2005 and became the school's ninth dean, and third female dean, in 2015.\n\nFounded in 1949, the UCLA School of Law is the third oldest of the five law schools within the University of California system.\n\nIn the 1930s, initial efforts to establish a law school at UCLA went nowhere as a result of resistance from UC President Robert Gordon Sproul, and because UCLA's supporters eventually refocused their efforts on first adding medical and engineering schools.\n\nDuring the mid-1940s, the impetus for the creation of the UCLA School of Law emerged from outside of the UCLA community. Assemblyman William Rosenthal of Boyle Heights (on the other side of Los Angeles from UCLA) conceived of and fought for the creation of the first public law school in Southern California as a convenient and affordable alternative to the expensive private law school at USC. Rosenthal's first attempt in 1945 failed, but his second attempt was able to gain momentum when the State Bar of California and the UCLA Alumni Association announced their support for the bill. On July 18, 1947, Governor Earl Warren authorized the appropriation of $1 million for the construction of a new law school at UCLA by signing Assembly Bill 1361 into state law.\n\nThe search for the law school's first dean was difficult and delayed its opening by a year. UCLA's Law School Planning Committee prioritized merit, while the then-conservative Regents of the University of California prioritized political beliefs. Another factor was a simultaneous deanship vacancy at Berkeley Law. Near the end of 1948, the Committee finally identified a sufficiently conservative candidate willing to take the job: L. Dale Coffman, then the dean of Vanderbilt University Law School. The Regents believed Coffman would help bring balance to the UCLA campus, which they saw as overrun by Communists.\n\nDean Coffman was able to recruit several distinguished faculty to UCLA, including Roscoe Pound, Brainerd Currie, Rollin M. Perkins, and Harold Verrall. To build a law library, he hired Thomas S. Dabagh, then the law librarian of the Los Angeles County Law Library. The UCLA School of Law officially opened in September 1949 in temporary quarters in former military barracks behind Royce Hall, and moved into a permanent home upon the completion of the original Law Building in 1951.\n\nCoffman's deanship did not end well, due to his vindictive and strongly prejudiced personality. One sign of early trouble was when he drove out Dabagh in 1952 after they could not bridge their fundamental differences over how to run the law library, which was widely regarded around the UCLA community as contributing to Dabagh's early death in 1959. On September 21, 1955, the faculty revolted in the form of a memorandum to Chancellor Raymond B. Allen alleging that Coffman was categorically refusing to hire Jews or anyone he perceived to be leftist, and that the school's reputation was deteriorating because Coffman's abrasive personality had led to excessive faculty turnover. On May 24, 1956, Coffman was stripped of his deanship after a lengthy investigation by a panel of deans of his biases and his \"dictatorial, undemocratic, and autocratic\" management style. He remained on the faculty until his forced retirement in 1973, but continued to face allegations as late as 1971 that he was \"an unreconstructed McCarthyite and pro-segregationist.\"\n\nCoffman's successor was Richard C. Maxwell, who served as the second dean of UCLA Law from 1958 to 1969. Dean Maxwell \"presided over happier, more harmonious years of institutional growth,\" and it was under his deanship that UCLA became \"the youngest top-ranked law school in the country.\" Dabagh's successor, Louis Piacenza, was able to grow the law school's library collection to 143,000 volumes by May 1963, which at that time was the 14th largest law school library in the United States.\n\nBy 1963, the law school had 600 students in a building designed for 550, and the Law Building's deficiencies had become all too evident, such as a complete lack of air conditioning. In October 1963, the law school administration announced a major remodeling and expansion project, which added air conditioning and a new wing to the building. During the 1960s, the law school grew so quickly that the new wing was already insufficient upon its completion in January 1967. From its founding to the end of the 20th century, UCLA Law struggled with severe overcrowding, as librarians, faculty, staff, and as many as 18 student organizations—at one point, more than any other law school in the United States—competed for limited space in the Law Building for books, classes, conferences, and offices. After four grueling years of construction, the chronic space shortage was ultimately relieved by the completion of the new Hugh and Hazel Darling Law Library on January 22, 2000.\n\nUCLA Law has approximately 950 students in its Juris Doctor (J.D.) program and 200 students in its Masters of Law (LL.M.) program, which is popular among foreign students intending to take the California Bar Exam. It also offers a Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) program for students who already have a J.D. and hope to become law professors.\n\nThe school was a pioneer in clinical legal education and today offers a strong experiential education program. Through clinical courses and related offerings, the school gives students the opportunity to directly represent clients in a variety of settings while under expert supervision. UCLA Law's clinics also provide service to many people who cannot afford to pay for their own legal services, including veterans, the homeless, and indigent individuals appearing in criminal and immigration courts. In 2017, the school opened the Documentary Film Legal Clinic and Music Industry Clinic, which provide legal services to aspiring visual journalists, musicians and entrepreneurs in the arts, and the Veterans Justice Clinic at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center.\n\nUCLA Law offers the only Critical Race Studies program in the country, focusing on the intersection between race and law. It also has a robust public interest program, offering TK. Its most prominent centers, programs and institutes include the Critical Race Studies program, the David J. Epstein Program in Public Interest Law and Policy; the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; the Lowell Milken Institute on Business Law and Policy; the Promise Institute for Human Rights; the Resnick Center for Food Law and Policy; the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy; and the Ziffren Center on Media, Entertainment, Technology and Sports Law.\n\nStudents can elect to specialize in Business Law and Policy, Entertainment Law, Environmental Law, Public Interest Law, Critical Race Studies, and Law and Philosophy. The roughly 300 students who begin Law School at UCLA every year are divided into sections to encourage a sense of community. Students take all of their first year courses with their sections.\n\nSeveral joint degree programs are available, which require four years of study and result in the simultaneous award of a Juris Doctor and master's degree in Afro-American Studies, American Indian Studies, Law and Management, Public Health, Public Policy, Philosophy, Social Welfare, and Urban Planning.\n\nUCLA School of Law has a faculty of over 100 members with expertise in all major disciplines of law, representing \"one of the most diverse in the country.\" Thirteen members of the school's tenured faculty have been recognized for being the most-cited scholars in their areas of specialty. The school faculty is ranked 11th for scholarship, up from 15th in 2010 and 13th in 2013.\n\nIn 2018, 6,243 students applied to attend UCLA Law, and 311 were enrolled. The average LSAT score for members of the entering Class of 2018 is 168. The average LSAT score for students in the 75th percentile is 169, and 165 for students in the 25th percentile it is 165. The average GPA for members of the entering Class of 2018 is 3.72. The average GPA score for students in the 75th percentile is 3.85, and for students in the 25th percentile it is 3.52.\n\nThe International Human Rights Law Program, founded in 2008, is an organization for human rights education, scholarship, advocacy, and policy-oriented research. It includes the Sanela Diana Jenkins International Justice Clinic, which assists in the apprehension and prosecution of alleged war criminals in Bosnia, initially focusing on the relations between Ratko Mladic, formerly head of the Bosnian Serb Army, and others accused of involvement in the Srebrenica massacre. Haris Silajdžić, President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, will work closely with the program.\n\nUCLA School of Law is located on the UCLA campus in the Westwood area of Los Angeles. The school is located approximately five miles from the Pacific Ocean and 12 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The UCLA campus sits in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains, between the communities of Brentwood to the west, Bel Air to the north, Holmby Hills to the east and Westwood to the south. The school is easily accessible via Wilshire Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard and Interstate 405.\n\nThe school proper is housed in a three-story brick building, with the library tower extending to four stories. A few offices, including the Office of Career Services, the Office of Admissions and the Office of Graduate Studies and International Programs, are housed in an adjacent building, Dodd Hall.\n\nIn 2019, \"US News & World Report\" ranked UCLA as 15th among U.S. law schools, 4th in environmental law and 8th in tax law.\n\nAccording to Brian Leiter's Law School rankings, UCLA Law ranks 8th in the nation in terms of scholarly impact as measured by academic citations of tenure-stream faculty during the years 2009–2013.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked UCLA the number one school for entertainment law in its inaugural 2012 rankings, and every year from 2014 through 2019.\n\nIn July 2017, UCLA Law's bar passage was 88%, compared to a statewide average for first-time test-takers of 62%.\n\nAmerican Bar Association data shows that (94%) of 2017 graduates had secured full-time, long-term, JD-required employment within ten months of graduation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As such, it plays a critical role in the tethering of these cells to activated platelets or endothelia expressing P-selectin.\n\nThe organization of the SELPLG gene closely resembles that of CD43 and the human platelet glycoprotein GpIb-alpha both of which have an intron in the 5-prime-noncoding region, a long second exon containing the complete coding region, and TATA-less promoters.\n\nP-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a glycoprotein found on white blood cells and endothelial cells that binds to P-selectin (P stands for platelet), which is one of a family of selectins that includes E-selectin (endothelial) and L-selectin (leukocyte). Selectins are part of the broader family of cell adhesion molecules. PSGL-1 can bind to all three members of the family but binds best (with the highest affinity) to P-selectin.\n\nPSGL-1 protein requires two distinct posttranslational modifications to gain its selectin binding activity: \n\nPSGL-1 is expressed on all white blood cells and plays an important role in the recruitment of white blood cells into inflamed tissue: White blood cells normally do not interact with the endothelium of blood vessels. However, inflammation causes the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) such as P-selectin on the surface of the blood vessel wall. White blood cells present in flowing blood can interact with CAM. The first step in this interaction process is carried out by PSGL-1 interacting with P-selectin and/or E-selectin on endothelial cells and adherent platelets. This interaction results in \"rolling\" of the white blood cell on the endothelial cell surface followed by stable adhesion and transmigration of the white blood cell into the inflamed tissue.\n\nIn mice it seems to be an immune factor regulating T-cell checkpoints, and it could be a target for future checkpoint inhibitor anti-cancer drugs.\n"}
{"id": "1975126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975126", "title": "Colony of Fiji", "text": "Colony of Fiji\n\nThe Colony of Fiji was a British Crown colony that existed from 1874 to 1970 in the territory of the present-day nation of Fiji. The United Kingdom declined its first opportunity to annex the Kingdom of Fiji in 1852. Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau had offered to cede the islands, subject to being allowed to retain his \"Tui Viti\" (King of Fiji) title, a condition unacceptable to both the British and to many of his fellow chiefs, who regarded him only as first among equals, if that. Mounting debts and threats from the United States Navy had led Cakobau to establish a constitutional monarchy with a government dominated by European settlers in 1871, following an agreement with the Australian Polynesia Company to pay his debts. The collapse of the new regime drove him to make another offer of cession in 1872, which the British accepted. On 10 October 1874, Britain began its rule of Fiji, which lasted until 10 October 1970.\n\nSir Hercules Robinson, who had arrived on 23 September 1874, was appointed as interim Governor. He was replaced in June 1875 by Sir Arthur Gordon. Rather than establish direct rule in all spheres, Gordon granted autonomy over local affairs to Fiji's chiefs, though they were now forbidden to engage in tribal warfare. The colony was divided into four regions, each under the control of a \"Roko;\" these regions were further subdivided into twelve districts, each ruled by a traditional chief. A Great Council of Chiefs was established in 1876 to advise the Governor. This body remained in existence until being suspended by the Military-backed interim government in 2007 and abolished in 2012. Under the 1997 Constitution, it functioned as an electoral college that chose Fiji's President, Vice-President, and 14 of the 32 Senators. In its early days, the Great Council was supplemented by a Native Regulation Board (now the Fijian Affairs Board); these two bodies together made laws for the Fijians. (European settlers, however, were not subject to its laws). In 1882, the capital was moved from Levuka to the more accessible Suva.\n\nAdopting a \"\"Fiji for the Fijians\"\" policy, Gordon prohibited further sales of land, although it could be leased. This policy has been continued, hardly modified, to this day, and some 83 percent of the land is still natively owned. He also banned the exploitation of Fijians as labourers, and following the failure of the cotton-growing enterprise in the early 1870s, Gordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from India to work on the sugarcane fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations. The 463 Indians arrived on 14 May 1879—the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916. The plan involved bringing the Indian workers to Fiji on a five-year contract, after which they could return to India at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to India at the government's expense or remaining in Fiji. The great majority chose to stay. The Queensland Act, which regulated indentured labour in Queensland, was made law in Fiji also.\n\nFiji was only peripherally involved in World War I which was fought mainly in Europe. More than 1,500 men volunteered for war service with British forces. Other volunteers saw service with Australian and NZ forces. One notable incident occurred in September 1917 when Count Felix von Luckner arrived at Wakaya Island, off the eastern coast of Viti Levu, after his raider, the \"Seeadler,\" had run aground in the Cook Islands following the shelling of Papeete in the French territory of Tahiti. On 21 September, the district police inspector took a number of Fijians to Wakaya, and von Luckner, not realizing that they were unarmed, unwittingly surrendered.\n\nCiting unwillingness to exploit the Fijian people, the colonial authorities did not permit Fijians to enlist. One Fijian of chiefly rank, a great-grandson of Cakobau's, did join the French Foreign Legion, however, and received the French military decoration, the Medalle Militaire. Sukuna later served with 100 other Fijians of the Fiji Labour Corps which served in a logistics role in France and Italy. In the years that followed, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, as he was later known, established himself as a leading chief in Fiji and set up institutions that safeguarded native Fijian land rights.\n\nWhen WW2 broke out many Fijians volunteered for military service with the Fiji Military Forces which was commanded by a NZ Army officer under a 1936 agreement with the British that NZ assume responsibility for the defence of Fiji. Two Fiji infantry battalions and commando units saw service with US Army units in Guadalcanal and Bougainville.\n\nThe Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, on 8 December 1941 (Fiji time), marked the beginning of the Pacific War. Japanese submarines launched seaplanes that flew over Fiji; Japanese submarine I-25 on 17 March 1942 and Japanese submarine I-10 on 30 November 1941.\n\nBecause of its central location, Fiji was selected as a training base for the Allies. An airstrip was built at Nadi (later to become an international airport), and gun emplacements studded the coast. Fijians gained a reputation for bravery in the Solomon Islands campaign, with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as \"death with velvet gloves.\" Corporal Sefanaia Sukanaivalu, of Yucata, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, as a result of his bravery in the Battle of Bougainville.\n\nIndo-Fijians, however, generally refused to enlist, after their demand for equal treatment to Europeans was refused. They disbanded a platoon they had organized, and contributed nothing more than one officer and 70 enlisted men in a reserve transport section, on condition that they not be sent overseas. The refusal of Indo-Fijians to play an active role in the war efforts become part of the ideological construction employed by Fijian ethno-nationalists to justify interethnic tensions in the post-war years.\n\nA Legislative Council, initially with advisory powers, had existed as an appointed body since 1874, but in 1904 it was made a partly elective body, with European male settlers empowered to elect 6 of the 19 Councillors. 2 members were appointed by the colonial Governor from a list of 6 candidates submitted by the Great Council of Chiefs; a further 8 \"official\" members were appointed by the Governor at his own discretion. The Governor himself was the 19th member. The first nominated Indian member was appointed in 1916; this position was made elective from 1929. A four-member Executive Council had also been established in 1904; this was not a \"Cabinet\" in the modern sense, as its members were not responsible to the Legislative Council.\n\nAfter World War II, Fiji began to take its first steps towards internal self-government. The Legislative Council was expanded to 32 members in 1953, 15 of them elected and divided equally among the three major ethnic constituencies (indigenous Fijians, Indo-Fijians, and Europeans). Indo-Fijian and European electors voted directly for 3 of the 5 members allocated to them (the other two were appointed by the Governor); the 5 indigenous Fijian members were all nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs. Ratu Sukuna was chosen as the first Speaker. Although the Legislative Council still had few of the powers of the modern Parliament, it brought native Fijians and Indo-Fijians into the official political structure for the first time, and fostered the beginning of a modern political culture in Fiji.\n\nThese steps towards self-rule were welcomed by the Indo-Fijian community, which by that time had come to outnumber the native Fijian population. Fearing Indo-Fijian domination, many Fijian chiefs saw the benevolent rule of the British as preferable to Indo-Fijian control and resisted British moves towards autonomy. By this time, however, the United Kingdom had apparently decided to divest itself of its colonial empire and pressed ahead with reforms. The Fijian people as a whole were enfranchised for the first time in 1963, when the legislature was made a wholly elective body, except for 2 members out of 36 nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs. 1964 saw the first step towards responsible government, with the introduction of the Member system. Specific portfolios were given to certain elected members of the Legislative Council. They did not constitute a Cabinet in the Westminster sense of the term, as they were officially advisers to the colonial Governor rather than ministers with executive authority, and were responsible only to the Governor, not to the legislature. Nevertheless, over the ensuing three years, the then Governor, Sir Derek Jakeway, treated the Members more and more like ministers, to prepare them for the advent of responsible government.\n\nA constitutional conference was held in London in July 1965, to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government. Indo-Fijians, led by A. D. Patel, demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government, with a fully elected legislature, to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters' roll. These demands were vigorously rejected by the ethnic Fijian delegation, who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an Indo-Fijian dominated government come to power. The British made it clear, however, that they were determined to bring Fiji to self-government and eventual independence. Realizing that they had no choice, Fiji's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get.\n\nA series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in 1967, with Ratu Kamisese Mara as the first Chief Minister. Ongoing negotiations between Mara and Sidiq Koya, who had taken over the leadership of the mainly Indo-Fijian National Federation Party on Patel's death in 1969, led to a second constitutional conference in London, in April 1970, at which Fiji's Legislative Council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation with the Commonwealth. The Legislative Council would be replaced with a bicameral Parliament, with a Senate dominated by Fijian chiefs and a popularly elected House of Representatives. In the 52-member House, Native Fijians and Indo-Fijians would each be allocated 22 seats, of which 12 would represent \"Communal constituencies\" comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles, and another 10 representing \"National constituencies\" to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage. A further 8 seats were reserved for \"General electors\" - Europeans, Chinese, Banaban Islanders, and other minorities; 3 of these were \"communal\" and 5 \"national\". With this compromise, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.\n\n"}

The head of the family in the 14th century, Jean de Béthencourt, organized an expedition to conquer the Canary Islands, resulting in his being made King of the Canary Islands. Though the royal title would be short-lived, it allowed the family to firmly establish itself afterwards in the Azores and Madeira islands. The family is one of the most expansive and established families of the Portuguese nobility.\n\nThrough the expansion of the Portuguese Empire and Spanish Crown, the family and name spread across the world, mainly throughout Iberian America (Portuguese America and Spanish America), as well as Portuguese Africa.\n\nThough the spelling \"Bettencourt\" is the most widely used and standardized spelling of the family, both in Portuguese and French, other spellings of the name have arisen. Some of these spellings include: Bethancourt/Betancourt, Béthencourt, Bentancour, Bentancourt, Betancoor, Betancur\", \"Betancurt\", \"Betancurth\", \"Betancor\", \"Betancurt\", \"Betencur\" and \"Betancor\".\n\nBettencourt and Betancourt are originally place-names in Northern France. The place-name element \"-court\" (courtyard, courtyard of a farm, farm) is typical of the French provinces, where the Frankish settlements formed an important part of the local population. It is translated from the Old Low Franconian word \"*hof,\" meaning \"courtyard\", \"courtyard of a farm\", \"farm\" (Dutch, Old English \"hof\", German \"Hof\").\n\nBettencourt and Béthencourt correspond with Bettenhoffen, Bettenhof or Bettenhoven found in Alsace, Germany or Flanders.\n\nThe first part \"Betten-\" is the Germanic personal name (owner's name) \"Betto\".\n\nThe surname Bettencourt/Béthencourt with various spellings extended throughout Spain, Portugal and their colonies, after the Norman-French explorer Jean de Béthencourt, who conquered the Canary Islands for Spain and received the title King of the Canary Islands.\n\nTo this day, Betancourt and other forms of his surname are quite frequent among Canary Islanders and people of Canary Islander descent, in spite of his death without issue, thanks to his having given his surname to newly baptized natives.\n\nExamples include former Colombian president Belisario Betancur, former Venezuelan president Rómulo Betancourt, and Hermano Pedro de San José de Betancurt, a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.

The event began as an annual exhibition in 1932, the first biennial was in 1973. The Whitney show is generally regarded as one of the leading shows in the art world, often setting or leading trends in contemporary art. It helped bring artists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pollock and Jeff Koons to prominence.\n\nIn 2010, for the first time a majority of the 55 artists included in that survey of contemporary American art were women. The 2012 exhibition featured 51 artists, the smallest number in the event's history.\n\nThe fifty-one artists for 2012 were selected by curator Elisabeth Sussman and freelance curator Jay Sanders. It was open for three months up to 27 May 2012 and presented for the first time \"heavy weight\" on dance, music and theatre. Those performance art variations were open to spectators all day long in a separate floor.\n\nThe Whitney Museum had a long history beginning in 1932 of having a large group exhibition of invited American artists every year called the 'Whitney Annual'. In the late sixties, it was decided to alternate between painting and sculpture, although by the 1970s the decision was to combine both together in a biennial. The first Biennial occurred in 1973. Since then, the biennials have pursued a different curatorial approach to include all media.\n\nIn the past the Whitney Museum has tried different ways to organize its biennial. It has used its own staff members and invited outside curators, including Europeans, to present the show. In 2010 it even asked a former art dealer, Jay Sanders, who would later become a Whitney curator, to help organize one.\n\nThe Whitney Biennial often extends to sculpture exhibitions in Central Park. The 2008 edition took over the Park Avenue Armory as a space for performance and installation art. The 2014 Whitney Biennial is the last one in the museum's Marcel Breuer building. The museum is leaving the Upper East Side for the meatpacking district, where it is scheduled to open its new building, designed by Renzo Piano, in 2015.\n\nIn 1987, the show was protested by the Guerrilla Girls for its alleged sexism and racism.\n\nStill referred to as the \"political\" biennial, the 1993 edition included works like Pepón Osorio's installation \"Scene of the Crime (Whose Crime?)\" of a Hispanic family's living room and Daniel Joseph Martinez's metal buttons bearing the message \"I can't imagine ever wanting to be white.\" The 1993 Whitney Biennial was the most diverse exhibit by a major American museum up until that time. In 1970 less than 1% of artists at the Whitney Museum were non-white. In 1991, only 10% of artists were non white. Vanessa Faye Johnson claimed that despite intentions, the \"lack of exchange and dialogue, the simplification of complex issues in the Biennial\" effectively cast the artists largely as victims in the eyes of the public. New York Times Art Critic, Roberta Smith called it \"pious, [and] often arid.\" Art Historian Robert Hughes vehemently criticized lack of painting, and the \"wretched pictorial ineptitude\" of the artists, dismissed the abundance of text as \"useless, boring mock documentation\", and mocked the focus on \"exclusion and marginalization ... [in] a world made bad for blacks, Latinos, gays, lesbians and women in general.\" The largely shared sentiment was that the public felt alienated by the confrontational demands of the artwork. It was the first Whitney Biennial to treat video works with the same attention to space as sculpture, designating two entire galleries to them. Text-heavy Installations demanded attention and participation from the audience. The artists made it extremely difficult to take in the work as a passive viewer.\n\nSince 2000, the Bucksbaum Award has been awarded to an artist exhibiting at the Biennial.\n\nThe 2014 Whitney Biennial was also somewhat controversial for its lack of diversity, 9 out of the 109 artists were black or African American, including Donelle Woolford, a fictional character developed by 52-year-old white artist Joe Scanlan. She was the only black female artist included in curator Michelle Grabner's exhibition. Eunsong Kim and Maya Isabella Mackrandilal criticized the piece: \"The insertion of people of color into white space doesn't make it less colonial or more radical—that's the rhetoric of imperialistic multiculturalism, a bullshit passé theory.\" and suggest this pieces treats \"othered bodies [as] subcontractable.\"\n\nAdditionally, The YAMS Collective, or HOWDOYOUSAYYAMINAFRICAN?, a collective of 38 mostly black and queer artists, writers, composers, academics, filmmakers and performers participated and withdrew from the 2014 Biennial as a protest of the Whitney Museum's policies.\n\nYams Collective member and artist Sienna Shields said \"Every Whitney Biennial I have ever been to, you can barely count the number of black artists in the show on one hand. I didn't want to be a part of that,\" Shields said. \"There are so many amazing artists of color that I have known in the past 12 years in New York that are essentially overlooked. But I just felt it was time for an intervention.\" Poet Christa Bell explained: \"[O]ur entire participation was a protest... Just because people don't know that doesn't mean it is any less of a protest. Withdrawal was the final act of protest. Black people en masse being inside of an institution like the Whitney, presenting art, is itself a form of protest. We just followed it through to its inevitable conclusion.\" \n\nThe 2017 Whitney Biennial featured a controversial painting of Emmett Till, entitled \"Open Casket\" by Dana Schutz, which sparked protest and a highly circulated petition calling for the painting to be removed and destroyed.\n\n\n"}

This was followed by another military coup in 2006. Rivalry between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, rather than ideological differences, have been the most visible cleavage of Fijian politics. Later in 2020, Fiji was hit by a coronavirus pandemic originated from Wuhan, China affecting the economy and the daily lives of the people.\n\nPost-independence politics came to be dominated by the Alliance Party of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. In the election of March 1977, the Indian-led opposition won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, but failed to form a government due to internal divisions, together with concern that indigenous Fijians would not accept Indo-Fijian leadership. (See also Fiji Constitutional Crisis of 1977). In April 1987, a coalition led by Dr. Timoci Bavadra, an ethnic Fijian supported by the Indo-Fijian community, won the general election and formed Fiji's first majority Indian government, with Dr. Bavadra serving as Prime Minister. Less than a month later, Dr. Bavadra was forcibly removed from power during a military coup led by Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka on 14 May 1987.\n\nAfter a period of continued jockeying and negotiation, Rabuka staged a second coup on 25 September 1987. The military government revoked the constitution and declared Fiji a republic on 10 October. This action, coupled with protests by the government of India, led to Fiji's expulsion from the Commonwealth and official nonrecognition of the Rabuka regime by foreign governments, including Australia and New Zealand. On 6 December, Rabuka resigned as Head of State and Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau was appointed the first President of the Fijian Republic. Mara was reappointed Prime Minister, and Rabuka became Minister of Home Affairs.\n\nThe new government drafted a new constitution that went into force in July 1990. Under its terms, majorities were reserved for ethnic Fijians in both houses of the legislature. Previously, in 1989, the government had released statistical information showing that for the first time since 1946, ethnic Fijians were a majority of the population. More than 12,000 Indo-Fijians and other minorities had left the country in the two years following the 1987 coups. After resigning from the military, Rabuka became Prime Minister under the new constitution in 1993.\n\nEthnic tensions simmered in 1995–1996 over the renewal of Indo-Fijian land leases and political maneuvering surrounding the mandated 7-year review of the 1990 constitution. The Constitutional Review Commission produced a draft constitution which expanded the size of the legislature, lowered the proportion of seats reserved by ethnic groups, reserved the presidency for ethnic Fijians but opened the position of Prime Minister to citizens of all races. Prime Minister Rabuka and President Mara, who had succeeded to the office on Ganilau's death in late 1993, supported the proposal, while the nationalist indigenous Fijian parties opposed it. The reformed Constitution was approved in July 1997. Fiji was readmitted to the Commonwealth in October.\n\nThe first legislative elections held under the new constitution took place in May 1999. Rabuka's coalition was defeated by Indo-Fijian parties led by Mahendra Chaudhry, who became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian prime minister. One year later, in May 2000, Chaudhry and most other members of parliament were taken hostage in the House of Representatives by gunmen led by ethnic Fijian nationalist George Speight. The standoff dragged on for 8 weeks, during which time Chaudhry was removed from office by the then-president due to his incapacitation — before the Fijian military seized power and brokered a negotiated end to the situation, then arrested Speight when he violated its terms. In February 2002, Speight was convicted of treason and is currently serving a life sentence. Former banker Laisenia Qarase was named interim Prime Minister and head of the interim civilian government by the military and the Great Council of Chiefs in July. In 2001, after a decision to restore the suspended constitution, Qarase defeated Chaudhry in a hotly contested election.\n\nThe 2000 coup left deep divisions in Fijian society. The Qarase government pursued controversial legislation proposing to compensate victims and pardon persons convicted of involvement in the coup. The legislation was presented as a way of laying the past to rest, but further antagonized the Indo-Fijian community as well as some sections of the indigenous Fijian community, including the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. Tensions between the government and the Military kept the nation in suspense from 2004 onwards, and saw a major escalation around the turn of 2005 and 2006. The Qarase government narrowly won reelection in May 2006, and subsequently formed a grand coalition with the rival Fiji Labour Party (FLP). The coalition government failed to placate the Military, however, and in late November it became clear that the government could not enforce its authority when the Military began openly defying its orders. The impasse culminated in a coup d'état on 5 December. Commodore Frank Bainimarama declared himself Acting President. On 4 January 2007, Bainimarama announced that he was restoring executive power to President Iloilo, who made a broadcast endorsing the actions of the military. The next day, Iloilo named Bainimarama as the interim Prime Minister, indicating that the military was still effectively in control.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that the Military-backed interim government was illegal, and ordered President Iloilo to appoint a neutral caretaker government pending general elections. Instead of following the court order, the interim government resigned, and Iloilo announced the following day in a televised broadcast that he was abrogating the 1997 Constitution. He dismissed all judges and civil servants, appointed himself Head of State \"of the new order\", and reappointed Bainimarama as Prime Minister, who announced that elections would not be held until 2014.\n\nEffectively, the Military remained in complete control of the country. Iloilo retired as President in July 2009 and was replaced by Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, a former Commander of the RFMF. A new constitution was promulgated in 2013, leading to elections in September 2014, which were won by Bainimarama and his FijiFirst Party.\n\nOn 19 March, Fiji confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in Lautoka. As a precautionary measure, the Government of Fiji announced the lockdown of the city until 7 April 2020. Later on 2 April, the Government announced a lockdown of Suva, after confirmed cases in the capital.\n\nAs the cases rose, Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama announced a nationwide curfew from 8pm to 5am. Schools and non-essential services was closed and the public was advised to stay at home and practice good hygiene.\n\nThere have been eighteen cases of the disease recorded in the month of April 2020. Nine in the Western Division, four in the Central Division and five in the Northern Division. \n\nMeanwhile, fifteen people have recovered from the virus. \n"}

Airtroopers are educated and trained to have the ability and motivation to work on their own initiative. AAC soldiers will be trained in a wide range of skills providing a number of military and civilian vocational qualifications. \n\nThe Army Air Corps provides battlefield helicopters and some fixed-wing aircraft for the army, the main roles being attack of enemy armour, surveillance and target acquisition. AAC groundcrew need to be able to work as part of a team, and on occasion as an individual, and may be expected to defend forward operating bases and forward arming refuelling points, they also refuel and re-arm the helicopters and provide the essential communications to the aircraft and other army units.\n\nAAC groundcrew work with a number of different types of helicopters including the, Lynx, Bell 212, Gazelle and Apache. They are also required to perform a number of other responsibilities within this employment, from helicopter troop drills, fire, crash rescue and helicopter rigger marshalling. There are a number of light goods vehicles utilised by the AAC, of which all groundcrew will be trained to drive and service, including Landrovers, Osh Kosh 22,000 litre refueller vehicles and the \"detachable rack operating platform systems\" (15 tonne flatbeds).\n\nAll Army Air Corps groundcrew are trained to be soldiers first during their basic, or phase 1 training. Initially recruits attend basic training which is called phase 1 training either as junior entry soldiers at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, or Army Training Regiment at Winchester, or as standard entry soldiers at the Army Training Centre, Pirbright.\n\nHaving successfully completed phase 1 training, recruits move to the School of Army Aviation, Middle Wallop, Hampshire to begin aviation employment training, or phase 2 training. This begins with a three-week induction course, including car theory, practise and tests and an in-depth insight to the AAC.

This course takes between 10-12 weeks where the airtrooper will be taught to drive and maintain light goods vehicles used in the AAC. At the end of these courses the airtrooper will be qualified as an AAC soldier class 3, ready to be posted to his/her first regiment.\n\nOn completion of Phase 2 training, airtroopers are posted to a regiment in either UK or Germany. Later there may be opportunities to serve in an independent squadron or flight in a variety of locations both home and abroad. Once in a regiment an airtrooper will be allocated to a squadron and carry out the ground duties for which he/she have been trained. \n\n"}
{"id": "1975218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975218", "title": "Medical school in the United Kingdom", "text": "Medical school in the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, medical school generally refers to a department within a university which is involved in the education of future medical practitioners. All leading British medical schools are state-funded and their core purpose is to train doctors on behalf of the National Health Service. Courses generally last Four to six years: two years of pre-clinical training in an academic environment and two to three years clinical training at a teaching hospital and in community settings. Medical schools and teaching hospitals are closely integrated. The course of study is extended to six years if an intercalated degree is taken in a related subject.\n\nIn the United Kingdom students generally begin medical school after secondary education. This contrasts with the US and Canadian (outside Quebec) systems, where a bachelor's degree is required for entry to medical school. Entry to British medical schools is very competitive.\n\nApplications for entry into medical school (in common with other university courses) are made through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). UCAS allows four applications per applicant for medicine, as opposed to the usual five. The remaining one can either be left blank, or be used to apply for a non-medical course.\n\nMost UK medical schools now also require applicants to sit additional entrance tests such as the Universities Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT) (required by 26 universities) and the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT) (required by 5 universities).\n\nThe number of available medical school places had risen by 3,500 since 1998. There are national quotas imposed on the number of places for students on medicine and dentistry courses in the UK as much of the training needs to occur in a healthcare setting. In 2016, places at medical school were offered through the clearing process for the first time, with St George's, University of London opening up places on its five-year medical degree undergraduate course.\n\nThe UCAS personal statement gives applicants the opportunity to write about why they are suitable for medicine. Personal statements are reviewed by university admission boards and applicants scoring highly in tests and with a good personal statement will be called to interview.\n\nInterviews for medicine differ between individual universities. The majority of medical school interview applicants using either a Traditional interview or the Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) formats. Oxford and Cambridge medical schools have their own distinct way of interviewing with focus on science questions and other medical schools also use group tasks to assess applicants.\n\nThe traditional medical interview consists of 2–4 interviewers sat across a table from the candidate. Interviewers take turns to ask the candidate set questions and rate their responses on a Likert scale. Interviews last between 15–30 minutes. Questions cover a range of desirable criteria that future doctors should possess.\n\nDeveloped at McMaster University Medical School in Canada in 2004, the MMI format assesses candidates as they cycle through a selection of 'mini' interview stations similar to the medical school OSCE. 1-2 interviewers assess candidates at each station and each station is focussed on a particular skill desirable of a doctor. Criteria assessed at individual stations may include:\n\nAfter successful completion of clinical training a student graduates as a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, abbreviated as \n\nBroadly speaking, undergraduate medical education in the United Kingdom may be thought of along two continuums:\nThese two can be combined in different ways to form different course types, and in reality few medical schools are at the extremes of either axis but occupy a middle ground.\n\nProblem-based learning (PBL) is a principle based on the educational philosophy of the French educationalist Célestin Freinet in the 1920s, and is used in many subject areas including medicine. It was first developed in relation to medical education at McMaster University Medical School in the late 1960s. It was introduced to the UK by Manchester University. It refers to a whole process, and not merely to a specific event (the PBL tutorial).\n\nIn the UK, the focus is on a PBL-tutorial which is conducted in small groups of around 8–10 students (although this varies with seniority and between medical school) with a tutor (or facilitator) who usually comes from either a clinical or academic background, depending on the level of the course. There is an academic, clinical or ethical scenario, where the students select which areas of study to pursue in their own time. Academics at Maastricht University developed seven steps of what should happen in the PBL process:\n\nIn keeping with the ethos of self-directed learning, during sessions it encourages a shift in power from an academic tutor to the students in a PBL group. However, it will be seen that lectures, tutorials and clinical teaching sessions can play a part in problem-based learning - but the emphasis is on the \"student\" to decide how these will enable them to fulfil their learning objectives, rather than passively absorb all information.\n\nThe introduction of PBL in the UK coincided with a General Medical Council report in 2003, \"Tomorrow's Doctors\", which recommended an increased proportion of learning should be student-centred and self-directed. This encouraged medical schools to adopt PBL, however some medical schools have adopted other methods to increase self-directed learning, whilst others (notably Oxford and Cambridge) have always had a high proportion of student-centred and self-directed learning, and have therefore not introduced PBL. Manchester Medical School adopted a new PBL curriculum in 1994, and were followed by Liverpool Medical School and Glasgow Medical School. The Norwich Medical School, at the University of East Anglia also uses a PBL based curriculum. Some of the UK medical schools created since that time have adopted problem based learning. Brighton and Sussex Medical School has a lecture-based approach supported by small-group and self-directed work. Similarly, Imperial College London employs mostly lecture-based teaching but uses supplementary teaching methods such as PBL to deliver a more rounded education.\n\n\"Tomorrow's Doctors\" also criticised the amount of unnecessary scientific knowledge irrelevant to clinical practice that medical students were required to learn, meaning that the curricula were altered in other ways around the same time that PBL was introduced in the UK. One study criticising problem-based learning found that some medical specialist registrars and consultants believe that PBL can promote incomplete learning and educational blind spots; particularly in anatomy and basic medical sciences, due to ultimate decision making within the PBL group resting with the students. This has also brought into question whether the lack of anatomical knowledge adequately prepares graduates for surgery, or negatively affects enthusiasm to enter certain specialties; including academic medicine, surgery, pathology and microbiology., although the purposeful reduction in anatomy teaching within all medical curricula which occurred following \"Tomorrow's Doctors\" may be in part to blame for reduced anatomical knowledge, rather than it being due to PBL.\n\nStudies have shown that students believe that PBL increases the educational effect of self study and their clinical inference ability, and although studies are conflicting, one showed that UK PRHO graduates believed that they were better at dealing with uncertainty and knowing their personal limits. Students feel less detached from clinical medicine through PBL and thus this may increase their enthusiasm for learning.\n\nNotably, universities that pioneered successful Problem-based-learning such as University of Montreal or McMaster are themselves prestigious institutions that hold worldwide reputations for clinical and academic excellence, taking the top few percent of worldwide graduate applicants. PBL can be considered to be more suitable to teaching of graduate medicine, whose students may benefit from the maturity of an existing degree and previous experience of self-directed learning, and perhaps unsuitable for less able students and undergraduates.\n\nLecture-based learning (LBL) consists of information delivered mainly through large lectures or seminars. This had been the predominant method of delivering pre-clinical medical education at many UK medical schools prior to the introduction of Tomorrow's Doctors. Teaching is delivered via large teaching events at which several hundred students may be present, which guides learning. Students are encouraged to do their own reading between lectures as the lectures will only cover the main points.\n\nKey points in support of LBL include that students gain the opportunity to listen to leading clinicians or academics, whereas PBL tutors may be underused. Lecture-based learning is also considerably cheaper to organise, requiring fewer staff members who can deliver lectures to large numbers of students at once, rather than the large number of separate tutors needed to deliver problem-based learning to small groups of eight students.\n\nCriticisms of lecture based learning include that students get much less interaction with both tutor and colleagues - they passively absorb information in lectures rather than questioning and searching out answers. The lack of interaction also means it is harder for tutors to know if individual students are struggling as they will only find out if students have not understood the lectures in exams, when arguably it is too late, whereas in problem-based learning, the tutor can assess how much each student is learning based on the student's participation in discussion within the weekly tutorials, and may be able to help students who are struggling earlier.\n\nLBL has been criticised for 'spoon feeding' students and thus not preparing them for future continued medical education, which is by necessity, self-directed. However, most lecture-based curricula involve a significant proportion of students doing self-directed reading between lectures. Some have also criticised lecture based learning for overloading students with information that may not be relevant to their first years in clinical practice, however this has more to do with curriculum design and course structure than teaching method.\n\nBoth lecture-based learning and problem-based learning may involve teaching from academics who are not medically qualified themselves.\n\nOne meta-analysis has suggested that PBL education produces graduates with no better factual or clinical knowledge than students from a lecture-based course, despite in some cases the graduates' belief that they are, questioning whether PBL learning is merely a popular trend.\n\nUndergraduate medical curricula can be divided on the basis of how they integrate or separate the theoretical learning in areas such as anatomy, physiology, ethics, psychology and biochemistry from the clinical areas such as medicine, surgery, obstetrics, paediatrics.\n\nTraditionally, medical courses entirely split the theoretical learning, teaching this on its own for 2–3 years in a \"pre-clinical course\" before students went on to study clinical subjects on their own for a further 3 years in a \"clinical course\". In some cases, these were taught at geographically distinct sites or even separate universities, with an entirely separate staff for each course, sometimes with the award of a BA or BSc at the end of the pre-clinical course. St Andrews, Cambridge and Oxford Universities are three of the most traditional pre-clinical medical schools- For example, the Cambridge first year of the Medical Sciences tripos is split into anatomy, biochemistry and physiology. Whilst there is a nominal \"Preparing for Patients\" aspect to the course when the students speak to real patients, this comprises a total of three afternoons over the entire year.\n\nThere has been a move for universities have tended to integrate teaching into \"systems-based teaching\" rather than \"subject-based teaching\". E.g. rather than studying separate distinct modules in anatomy, physiology, ethics, psychology and biochemistry, students study distinct modules in different body systems, e.g. \"heart and lungs\" or \"nervous system\" - during which they will study the anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, psychology, etc. relevant to that system. The same also has happened with clinical subjects, so for example rather than studying \"medicine\" and \"surgery\" separately, students may have a \"heart\" module in which they study clinical cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery together. In some medical schools there is integration of clinical and pre-clinical subjects together - e.g. a \"heart\" module would include anatomy of the heart, physiology of the heart, clinical examination, clinical cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery being studied in one module.\n\nSince \"Tomorrow's Doctors\", there has been a move in the UK towards integrating clinical and non-clinical subjects together to a greater extent. This has varied considerably between universities, always with an emphasis towards non-clinical subjects towards the start of the course and clinical subjects towards the end. A variety of models are in operation. Any model may use PBL or LBL learning methods: for example Manchester has a PBL-based curriculum but a strong pre-clinical/clinical divide, whilst Brighton and Sussex Medical School has a more integrated curriculum, delivered via a lecture-based programme. Many factors influence the choice of model, including the educational philosophy of the institution and the distance of the attached teaching hospitals to the university base (it is much easier for universities with teaching hospitals nearby to offer an integrated curriculum).\n\nModels include:\n\nSupport for a less integrated course includes that it achieves a basic scientific foundation from which to build clinical knowledge upon in later years. However it is criticised for producing graduates with inferior communication skills and making transition into the clinical environment more difficult in year 3 or 4.\nSupport for a more integrated course includes that by allowing patient interaction early, the course produces students who are more at ease with communicating with patients and better developed interpersonal skills. Criticisms include, questioning whether students in the first year have a place in the healthcare environment, when actual clinical knowledge may be virtually nil.\n\n\"Tomorrow's Doctors\" also led to the introduction of significant student choice in the syllabus in the form of student selected components.\n\nAfter graduation medical students enter paid employment, as a Foundation House Officer (FHO), during which they will complete the first year of \"Foundation Training\". Foundation training focusses on the seven principles of the MMC training ethos: trainee centred, competency assessed, service based, quality assured, flexible, coached, and structured & streamlined. Graduates are still a year away from obtaining full registration with the General Medical Council. During this year trainees are legally only able to work in certain supervised jobs, as a Foundation House Officer 1 (FHO1), and cannot legally practise independently, and it is the responsibility of the medical school they attended to supervise this year until they are fully registered with the General Medical Council. Therefore, the first year of the Foundation Programme forms the final year of medical school.\n\nStudents in their final year will begin the process of applying for jobs. The new system, called the UK Foundation Programme, (implemented by the NHS Modernising Medical Careers) involves a simplified online application process, without interviews, based on a matching scheme. Students rank their preferred Foundation Schools (which often comprise a catchment area of two or three cities). They are ranked based both on the answers given on their application form, and their marks gained in examinations during their undergraduate career, the resulting score determines which job the student will get when they graduate. After being selected to a Foundation School, applicants are then selected into specific jobs by a selection procedure determined locally by each Foundation School, which may include an interview, submission of a CV or use of the score gained in MTAS.\n\nPreviously, another online system called Multi-Deanery Application Process (MDAP) system was used for applications to the Foundation Programme in some areas of the UK. This was criticised in the media and in some medical publications, and was replaced by Medical Training Application System in 2006.\n\nRecently several four year graduate entry schemes have been introduced in some English and Welsh medical schools which cover a similar range and depth of knowledge to the undergraduate scheme but at a more intensive pace. The accelerated pace is largely in the pre-clinical phase of the medical programme, with the GMC mandating a minimum number of clinical hours in the clinical phase of medical degrees.\n\nThese courses have a limited number of spaces and include some funding after the first year, so competition is very high. Some sources report in the region of 60 applicants for each place as these courses have become more widely known. Until relatively recently, people over thirty were strongly discouraged from applying. Entrance to these programmes usually involves sitting a competitive selection test. The most common entry examinations are the GAMSAT (Graduate Australian Medical Schools Admissions Test) or MSAT (Medical Schools Admissions Test). Some schools may use existing entrance examinations that school leavers are also usually required to take e.g. UKCAT or BMAT (see above).\n\nThe admissions criteria for these graduate entry programmes vary between universities - some universities require the applicant's first degree to be in a science-related discipline, whereas others will accept a degree in any subject as sufficient evidence of academic ability.\n\nThe following universities offer four year graduate entry programmes:\n\n\nHowever, graduates are free to apply to some of the regular five/six year courses. Indeed, universities offering both graduate entry and school leaver entry courses often encourage applications to one of the two course types, depending on the graduate's educational background.\n\nSome medical students spend one or two additional years at medical school (lengthening a five-year course to six or seven years) studying for an intercalated degree. This is an extra degree awarded in addition to their medical degrees, giving the student the opportunity to gain an extra qualification, and aids students' research and individual study skills. At the end of this \"intercalated year or two\" students are awarded a degree, which is variously styled as BSc, BA, MSc, BMSc (Hons), BMedSci(Hons), MA, MPH, MClinEd depending on the university, level of award, and subject studied. Usually students complete an intercalated bachelor's degree the year after completing the second or third year of their medical course. Master's degrees are offered at some schools for students who have completed the fourth year of their medical course. Higher research related masters and academic doctorates are typically undertaken at the end of the fifth year of the course. There is typically strong competition to secure funding from external institutions such as pharmaceutical companies, as such research related intercalated degrees may be in an area the student has little long-term interest, a frequent criticism. The major benefit of an intercalated degree is the increased chance of selection to competitive training routes such as Academic Medicine or Surgery.\n\nThe way the programme is implemented varies across the country: sometimes the intercalated degree will be specifically for medical students (e.g. a supervisor-led research project culminating in a dissertation), whilst sometimes the intercalated student will complete taught courses offered to final year BSc or masters students, or a combination of these. At some medical schools the intercalated degree may be undertaken in a specific subjects (e.g. Immunology, Pathology, Cardiovascular Science, Respiratory Science, Social Medicine, Management, History Of Medicine, Humanities etc.), whilst at other medical schools there is a common curriculum for all intercalated students (often with some choice within it).\n\nAt many medical schools, the year is optional, and a relatively small percentage of students elect to study for it. At the University of Nottingham, all students undertake a research project and dissertation under the supervision of schools within the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, leading to a BMedSci (Hons) Degree in the third year. Whilst this additional degree is uniquely awarded within the five-year period of study, Nottingham medical students undertake heavily extended third and fourth years of up to 48 weeks in order to accomplish both the BMedSci and early clinical training.\n\nIn contrast to this, all students at University College London, Imperial College London, Bute Medical School (St Andrews), University of Oxford, University of Edinburgh and University of Cambridge study for a BSc/BA in addition to their medical degrees. These five medical schools have a six-year curriculum, in which students complete a three-year pre-clinical course, which leads to a BSc or BA, followed by a three-year clinical course, which in combination with the BSc or BA leads to a full medical degree. The degree awarded is BA at Oxford and Cambridge (which later becomes an MA), and BSc at the others. At these five medical schools, it is sometimes also possible to spend extra optional year(s) where one can study for an intercalated masters or doctoral degree in addition to the BSc/BA which all students receive, for example, the University of Cambridge offers an MB PhD programme of nine years total duration comprising preclinical training, the intercalated BA (see above), clinical training and within the clinical training period a PhD. University College London also offers an MB PhD programme which can be completed in nine years of study.\n\nDegrees are classified according to the British undergraduate degree classification system. This is taken into account in the Foundation Schools Application Form, in which applicants are awarded extra points for a higher class degree. As of 2012, intercalated degrees are able to contribute the maximum of 4 points to the foundation year 1 posts application. The number of points awarded is as following: 4 for a first class, 3 points for a 2.1 class, 2 points for 2.2 class and 1 point for a third class.\n\nMost UK medical students belong to student unions, or groups set up within the university's students' union and run by and for medical students, typically organising social events (such as Balls/formals), sporting events (e.g. the National Association of Medics' Sports (NAMS) and academic events or career events. Four medical schools have separate student unions for medical students: Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union, Edinburgh's Royal Medical Society, UCL (RUMS: Royal Free, University College and Middlesex Medical Students' Society) & Barts & The London Student's Association.\n\nThe United Kingdom Medical Students Association (UKMSA) is a nationally based student-doctor collaboration which unites medical societies and their student members across different universities in the UK. The current (2017) president is Andrew Cole, and the vice president is Michael Grant.\n\nMeducation is an online revision and learning tool that encourages social interaction between medical students worldwide. It has 30,000 users.\n\nThe largest free publication in the UK for medical students is the award-winning Medical Student Newspaper. It is written and produced entirely by medical students and is distributed in hard copy to the five medical schools of London, and available online for all.\n\nMany students also focus on extracurricular academic activities, for example many UK schools have their own student society dedicated to improving health both within the local area through various action projects and globally, through campaigning and working abroad. Medsin is a fully student run network of healthcare students and is the UK's member of the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations. Other societies are dedicated to raising awareness about careers in specialties such as surgery and general practice.\n\nThere are many student awards available, varying in prestige, from local university awards to national awards. Considered the most prestigious award for a medical student in the UK is the currently Medical Student of the Year, hosted by The Royal Society of Medicine and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. This is largely because the other colleges have no such award, with the normal national prizes being named after experts in that field.\n\n"}
{"id": "1975220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975220", "title": "Labia", "text": "Labia\n\nThe labia are part of the female genitalia; they are the major externally visible portions of the vulva. In humans, there are two pairs of labia: the \"labia majora\" (or the outer labia) are larger and fattier, while the \"labia minora\" are folds of skin between the outer labia. The labia surround and protect the clitoris and the openings of the vagina and the urethra.\n\n\"Labium\" (plural \"labia\") is a Latin-derived term meaning \"lip\". \"Labium\" and its derivatives (including labial, labrum) are used to describe any lip-like structure, but in the English language, labium often specifically refers to parts of the vulva.\n\nThe labia majora, also commonly called outer labia or outer lips, are lip-like structures consisting mostly of skin and adipose (fatty) tissue, which extend on either side of the vulva to form the pudendal cleft through the middle. The labia majora often have a plump appearance, and are thicker towards the anterior. The anterior junction of the labia majora is called the anterior commissure, which is below the mons pubis and above the clitoris. To the posterior, the labia majora join at the posterior commissure, which is above the perineum and below the frenulum of the labia minora. The grooves between the labia majora and labia minora are known as the interlabial sulci or interlabial folds.\n\nThe labia minora (obsolete: nymphae), also called inner labia or inner lips, are two soft folds of fat-free, hairless skin between the labia majora. They enclose and protect the vulvar vestibule, urethra and vagina. The upper portion of each labium minora splits to join with both the clitoral glans, and the clitoral hood. The labia minora meet posterially at the frenulum of the labia minora (also known as the fourchette), which is a fold of skin below the vaginal orifice. The fourchette is more prominent in younger women, and often recedes after sexual activity and childbirth. \nWhen standing or with the legs together, the labia majora usually entirely or partially cover the moist, sensitive inner surfaces of the vulva, which indirectly protects the vagina and urethra, much like the lips protect the mouth. The outer surface of the labia majora is pigmented skin, and develops pubic hair during puberty. The inner surface of the labia majora is smooth, hairless skin, which resembles a mucous membrane, and is only visible when the labia majora and labia minora are drawn apart.\n\nBoth the inner and outer surfaces of the labia majora contain sebaceous glands (oil glands), apocrine sweat glands, and eccrine sweat glands. The labia majora have fewer superficial nerve endings than the rest of the vulva, but the skin is highly vascularized. The internal surface of the labia minora is a thin moist skin, with the appearance of a mucous membrane. They contain many sebaceous glands, and occasionally have eccrine sweat glands. The labia minora have many sensory nerve endings, and have a core of erectile tissue.\n\nThe color, size, length and shape of the inner labia can vary extensively from woman to woman. In some women the \"labia minora\" are almost non-existent, and in others they can be fleshy and protuberant. They can range in color from a light pink to brownish black, and texturally can vary between smooth and very rugose.\n\nThe biological sex of an individual is determined at conception, which is the moment a sperm fertilizes an ovum, creating a zygote. The chromosome type contained in the sperm determines the sex of the zygote. A Y chromosome results in a male, and an X chromosome results in a female. A male zygote will later grow into an embryo and form testes, which produce androgens (primarily male hormones), usually causing male genitals to be formed. Female genitals will usually be formed in the absence of significant androgen exposure.\n\nThe genitals begin to develop after approximately 4 to 6 weeks of gestation. Initially, the external genitals develop the same way regardless of the sex of the embryo, and this period of development is called the \"sexually indifferent\" stage. The embroyo develops three distinct external genital structures: a genital tubercle; two urogenital folds, one on either side of the tubercle; and two labioscrotal swellings, each bounding one of the urogenital folds.\n\nSexual differentiation starts on the internal sex organs at about 5 weeks of gestation, resulting in the formation of either testes in males, or ovaries in females. If testes are formed, they begin to secrete androgens that affect the external genital development at about week 8 or 9 of gestation. The urogenital folds form the labia minora in females, or penile shaft in males. The labioscrotal swellings become the labia majora in females, or they fuse to become the scrotum in males. Because the male and female parts develop from the same tissues, this makes them homologous (different versions of the same structure). Sexual differentiation is complete at around 12 weeks of gestation.\n\nThe genital tissues are greatly influenced by natural fluctuations in hormone levels, which lead to changes in labia size, appearance, and elasticity at various life stages. At birth, the labia minora are well-developed, and the labia majora appear plump due to being exposed to maternal hormones in the womb. The labia majora have the same color as the surrounding skin. Labial adhesions can occur between the ages of 3 months and 2 years, and may make the vulva look flat. These adhesions are not usually a cause for concern, and usually disappear without treatment. Treatment options may include estrogen cream, manual separation with local anesthesia, or surgical separation under sedation.\n\nDuring early childhood, the labia majora look flat and smooth because of decreasing levels of body fat, and the diminished effects of maternal hormones. The labia minora become less prominent.\n\nDuring puberty, increased hormone levels often significantly change the appearance of the labia. The labia minora become more elastic, prominent, and wrinkled. The labia majora regain fat, and begin growing pubic hair close to the pudendal cleft. Hair is initially sparse and straight, but gradually becomes darker, denser, and curlier as growth spreads outward and upward toward the thighs and mons pubis. At the end of puberty, pubic hair will be coarse, curly, and fairly thick. The patch of pubic hair covering the genitals will eventually often form a triangle shape.\n\nBy adulthood, the outer surface of the labia majora may be darker than the surrounding skin, and may have wrinkles similar to those on a male's scrotum. During the reproductive years, if a woman delivers a child, the fourchette will flatten. Pregnancy may cause the labia minora to darken in color.\n\nLater in life, the labia majora once again gradually lose fat, becoming flatter and more wrinkled, and pubic hair turns grey. Following menopause, falling hormone levels cause further changes to the labia. The labia minora atrophy, making them become less elastic, and pubic hair on the labia majora becomes more sparse.\n\nThe labia are one of a woman's erogenous zones. The labia minora are sexually responsive, and sensitivity varies greatly between women. In some women, they are so sensitive that anything other than light touch may be uncomfortable, whereas stimulation may elicit no sexual response in others. The labia may be sexually stimulated as part of masturbation or with a sex partner, such as by fingering or oral sex. Moving the labia minora can also stimulate the extremely sensitive clitoris.\n\nDuring sexual arousal, the labia majora swell due to increased blood flow to the region, and draw back, opening the vulva slightly. The labia minora become engorged with blood, causing them to expand in diameter by two to three times, and darken or redden in color. Because pregnancy and childbirth increase genital vascularity, the inner and outer labia will engorge faster in women who have had children.\n\nAfter a period of sexual stimulation, the labia minora will become further engorged with blood approximately 30 seconds to 3 minutes before orgasm, causing them to redden further. In women who have had children, the labia majora may also swell significantly during this period, becoming dark red. Continued stimulation can result in an orgasm, and the orgasmic contractions help remove blood trapped in the inner and outer labia, as well as the clitoris and other parts of the vulva, which causes pleasurable orgasmic sensations.\n\nFollowing orgasm or when a woman is no longer sexually aroused, the labia gradually return to their unaroused state. The labia minora return to their original color within 2 minutes, and engorgement dissipates in about 5 to 10 minutes. The labia majora return to their pre-arousal state in approximately 1 hour.\n\nIn many cultures and locations all over the world, the labia, as part of the genitalia, are considered private, or intimate parts, whose exposure (especially in public) is governed by fairly strict socio-cultural mores. In many cases, public exposure is limited, and often prohibited by law.\n\nViews on pubic hair differ between people and between cultures. Some women prefer the look or feel of pubic hair, while others may choose to remove some or all of it. Temporary methods of removal include shaving, trimming, waxing, sugaring and depilatory products while permanent hair removal can be accomplished using electrolysis or laser hair removal. In Korea, pubic hair is considered a sign of fertility, leading some women to have pubic hair transplants.\n\nSome women in western societies are self-conscious about the size, color or asymmetry of their labia. Viewing pornography may influence a woman's view of her genitals. Models in pornography frequently have small or non-existent labia minora, and images are often airbrushed, so pornographic images do not depict the full range of natural variations of the vulva. This can lead viewers of pornography to have unrealistic expectations about how the labia should look. Similar to how some women develop self-esteem issues from comparing their faces and bodies to airbrushed models in magazines, women who compare their vulvas to idealized pornographic images may believe their own labia are abnormal. This can have a negative impact on a woman's life, since genital self-consciousness makes it more difficult to enjoy sexual activity, see a gynecologist, or perform a genital self-examination. Developing an awareness for how much the labia truly differ between individuals may help to overcome this self-consciousness.\n\nIn several countries in Africa and Asia, the external female genitals are routinely altered or removed for reasons related to ideas about tradition, purity, hygiene and aesthetics. Known as female genital mutilation, the procedures include clitoridectomy and so-called \"pharaonic circumcision,\" whereby the inner and outer labia are removed and the vulva is sewn shut. FGM is mostly outlawed around the world, even in countries where the practice is widespread.\n\nLabiaplasty is a controversial plastic surgery procedure that involves the creation or reshaping of the labia. Labia piercing is a cosmetic piercing, usually with a special needle under sterile conditions, of the inner or outer labia. Jewelry is worn in the resulting opening.\n\n"}

He grew up in Carlsbad, California where he graduated from Carlsbad High School in 1991. From there he attended the University of Colorado and was drafted by the Patriots in the second round of the 1995 NFL Draft with the 57th overall selection.\n\nIn his ten-year professional career, Johnson played in 125 regular season games and recorded 763 tackles, 11.5 sacks, one interception, 16 passes defensed, six forced fumbles, and seven fumble recoveries. He was noted for his ability to generate many tackles and for his smart play at the linebacker position. He also was able to make an impact for the Patriots without tackling the ballcarrier, as former Fox Network analyst and NFL player Matt Millen states, \"What you didn't see is Ted Johnson stoning the guard, getting off the guard, taking on the fullback and freeing up (Todd) Collins to make the tackle. That play does not get made except for Ted Johnson.\"\n\nJohnson retired before the 2005 NFL season after sustaining many documented and undocumented concussions during his career.\n\nIn an interview with \"USA Today\" in 2005, Johnson indicated he would know the opposing team's private signals or audibles prior to the game in order to have a competitive advantage. He claims that he never knew the source of the confidential information.\nOn February 1, 2007 Johnson told the \"New York Times\" that he suffers from amphetamine addiction, depression and headaches related to post-concussion syndrome and Second Impact Syndrome. He placed some blame on his former coach Bill Belichick for pressuring him to participate in full contact practice drills three days after suffering a concussion in an exhibition game against the New York Giants in August 2002. Johnson reported that during the drills, he suffered a second concussion, and he argues that Belichick asked him to participate against the advice of the team's head trainer. Belichick denies these allegations. Some thought Johnson's revelation was suspect based upon a December 20, 2006 column in the \"Boston Herald\" where columnist Michael Felger said Johnson told him that he would have considered playing for the Patriots in 2006 had they asked (in the wake of a season-ending injury to linebacker Junior Seau). However, in a February 14, 2007 interview on the Dennis and Callahan Show on WEEI, Johnson claimed he wasn't being serious when he said that, and in fact stated he said it sarcastically.\nOn January 28, 2009, he discussed his problems with concussions sustained during his pro football career and the impact it had on his life in a CNN article. He indicated he was very inactive for two years following his retirement, barely leaving the house, and described those as bad days. He describes himself as still occasionally suffering from anger, depression, and throbbing headaches. The implication is that he is feeling better recently; however, no details are provided.\n\nJohnson served as an adjunct professor for two years at Suffolk University in the Boston area. \n\nIn 1984, Ted Johnson Sr., his father, and Sylvia Johnson, his stepmother, opened The Original Rib Tickler barbecue restaurant in Tomball, TX.\n\nJohnson spent the 2005 season as a football analyst for Boston television station WBZ-TV, but resigned from the station in 2006.\n\nJohnson served as a co-host of \"The Triple Threat\" afternoon show on KILT (SportsRadio 610) in Houston. During his radio sports talk show on March 21, 2013, he was asked who was the ugliest wife in the NFL. He named Bianca Wilfork, wife of his former teammate Vince Wilfork. After receiving widespread criticism for his comment, including from Wilfork, Johnson issued an apology. Johnson left the Triple Threat and SportsRadio 610 in summer 2018 to return to the northeastern US.\n\nIn December 2018, 98.5 The Sports Hub in Boston hired Johnson.\n"}

Aitchison\n\nJames Hermiston Aitchison (1908 in Innerleithen, Scotland – 12 July 1994 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada) was a Canadian academic and politician and leader of the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party.\n\nHe was the son of James Charles Aitchison and Elizabeth Fleming. He came to Canada at an early age and was raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education from the University of Saskatchewan. He would go on to earn a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of London and a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto.\n\nDuring World War Two, he served in the Canadian Army as a major from 1942 to 1946. After his service Aitchison taught high school and eventually lectured at Brandon College, Manitoba; University of Toronto; McMaster University; and Victoria College, Victoria, British Columbia. From 1949 to 1973 he taught political science at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He served for a period as chairman of the department, and remained professor emeritus within the department until his retirement in 1983.\n\nDuring his time at Dalhousie University, he served as the first president of the Dalhousie Faculty Association, as well as president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, chairman of the Social Sciences Research Council of Canada; vice-president of the Canadian Political Science Association as well as vice president of the Institute for Public Administration of Canada. He also served as a council member for many years on the Atlantic Council of Canada.\n\nIn 1961 the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) joined with the Canadian Labour Congress to form the New Democratic Party. Aitchison became the provincial party's leader in 1963. He led the party through the 1963 and 1967 provincial elections. His critics accused him of being part of the Halifax elite that was believed to have taken the party from its traditional roots and leadership in industrial Cape Breton. He declined to re-offer in 1968 and was replaced by Cape Bretoner, Jeremy Akerman. However, Aitchison continued to be active within the party until the early 1970s, when he ceased involvement.\n\nHe ran twice as a candidate for the Nova Scotia Legislature, in the 1963 and 1967 provincial general elections. Both he and the party failed to win any seats during these elections, leaving the NDP without representation in the Legislature. Aitchison also ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the federal elections of 1962 and 1965, but again failed to win a seat. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia NDP achieved its worst electoral results. In the two provincial elections he led the party, it recorded its lowest percentage of the popular vote in the modern era. The 1963 campaign reached a twenty-five-year low (if including its predecessor, the CCF), when the party received just about four percent of the popular vote.\n\nAitchison married Oriole Faram and had one daughter.

He formerly served as head coach of the Detroit Pistons and the New Jersey Nets, and has been an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics and the Nets.\n\nFrank was born in New York City, and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey. He graduated from Teaneck High School in 1989, but he never made the school's basketball team. He attended Camp Greylock for Boys, a sports camp in the Berkshires. He played for a Jewish Community Center team and was also a player-coach for a Catholic Youth Organization team.\n\nHe earned his B.S. in education from Indiana University in 1992, where he spent four seasons as a manager for the Hoosier basketball team coached by Bob Knight. During his time at Indiana the Hoosiers won the Big Ten Conference championship twice, once in the 1988–1989 season and again in the 1990-91 season. His senior year, during the 1991-92 season, Indiana reached the 1992 NCAA Final Four, but fell to Duke in a foul-plagued game in Minneapolis.\n\nFrank has frequently cited Knight as a role model and mentor. Asked what he learned most of Knight, he said, \"It's more of what he stood for. If you work hard and are trustworthy it will carry you a long way. Master your subject matter, have confidence, be reliable and sincere. He is a great mentor and teacher to have at age 18. With him you started at the bottom and were given nothing. Everything you got, you earned – sweat equity.\" \n\nFrank served as an assistant coach at the University of Tennessee for three seasons under Head coach Kevin O'Neill. Frank first worked with O'Neill as a staff assistant at Marquette University in 1992 and during his tenure, helped lead the Marquette Warriors to two NCAA tournament berths and a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1994.\n\nFrank then spent three seasons as an assistant coach for the Vancouver Grizzlies under Brian Hill. Hill would later serve as Frank's assistant with the New Jersey Nets. His responsibilities with the Grizzlies included scouting upcoming opponents as well as practice and bench coaching duties.\n\nFrank became the interim head coach of the New Jersey Nets on January 26, 2004, succeeding Byron Scott, after serving as an assistant coach with the team since the 2000-01 season. He officially became the head coach of the Nets on June 21, 2004.\n\nFrank began his NBA head coaching career by achieving a 13–0 record from January 27 to February 24, 2004, setting a new NBA record for the most consecutive wins by a rookie NBA head coach. The 13-game winning streak was also the longest winning streak of a rookie head coach in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues. During this streak, the Nets won six consecutive games on the road, giving Frank the mark for the most road-game wins by a rookie head coach.\n\nThe Nets picked up the extension option in Lawrence's contract on June 6, 2006, and added a two-year extension on July 23, 2007. However, Frank's tenure as Nets head coach ended on November 29, 2009, after the Nets began the season with an 0–16 record. This streak was ongoing at the time of his dismissal and continued afterwards. Frank was the only coach ever in the NBA to start and end his tenure with a team with a double digit winning streak and losing streak. Following his firing, Frank worked as an analyst for NBATV. On July 15, 2010, Frank was hired by the Boston Celtics, replacing Tom Thibodeau as the lead assistant coach on Doc Rivers' coaching staff.\n\nOn August 3, 2011, Frank was announced as the head coach of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nAfter a loss to Oklahoma City Thunder on November 12, 2012, the Pistons fell to 0–8. This made Frank the third coach in the history of the NBA to start at least 0–8 with two separate franchises.\n\nOn April 18, 2013, Frank was fired by the Pistons after going 54–94 in two seasons.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, he gave in to rookie coach Jason Kidd's rather public recruiting efforts to make Frank (who had coached Kidd when he played for the Nets) his lead assistant coach on the now-Brooklyn Nets. Frank's contract made him the highest-paid assistant coach in the NBA at the time (approximately $6 million over 6 years). Preferring to delegate his authority, Kidd stated that Frank's role would be to run the team's defense, while being Kidd's head-coaching mentor. Kidd placed another assistant coach, John Welch, in charge of the team's offense.\n\nOn December 3, 2013, Frank was demoted, relegated by Nets head coach Jason Kidd to merely filing team evaluation reports. This so-called \"re-assignment\" meant that Frank would be banned from being on the bench during games and from even attending team practices. This resulted from escalating tensions and squabbling between the two over the 'right' coaching philosophies, strategies, and tactics for the team.\n\nOn September 26, 2014, Frank negotiated a buyout from the Nets and began talks to join the Clippers staff.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, the Clippers promoted him to Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations.\n\nOn August 04, 2017, Frank promoted as President for Basketball Operation replacing Doc Rivers. Rivers gave up his position to focus as a head coach of the team.\n\nFrank has a wife and two daughters and lives in New Jersey during the offseason. \n\nIn addition to his degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Frank also holds an M.S. in education administration from Marquette University.\n\n"}

The show is a mix of sketch comedy and a sitcom; there is a central plot for each episode and recurring characters, but the show ignores continuity and is often surreal.\n\nThe trio made 28 short films between 1998 and 2002, which were shown as part of the live show. The shorts cover various topics such as searching for Santa, mustache growing, pizza eating, and other absurd situations. The group cleaned up much of its material for the show, as much of the humor in the sketches and short films was often derived from taboo or adult topics like necrophilia and dildos.\n\nThe show employs absurdist humor.

These watches are divided into work periods to ensure that the roles are always occupied at all times, while those members of the crew who are assigned to a work during a watch are known as \"watch keepers\".\n\nOn a typical seafaring vessel, be it naval or merchant, personnel \"keep watch\" in various locations and duties across the ship, such as the bridge and engine room. Typical bridge watchkeepers include a lookout and a deck officer who is responsible for the safe navigation of the ship; whereas in the engine room, an engine officer ensures that running machinery continues to operate within tolerances.\n\nA wide variety of types of watches have developed due to the different needs aboard merchant and naval vessels. This table gives some examples:\n\nA watch system, watch schedule, or watch bill is a method of assigning regular periods of watchkeeping duty aboard ships and some other areas of employment. A watch system allows the ship's crew to operate the ship 24 hours a day while also allowing individual personnel adequate time for rest and other duties.\n\nWatch durations vary between vessels due to a number of reasons and restrictions; some watch systems aim to ensure that each team takes turns to work late at night, while other systems ensure the same team consistently works at the same hours every day.\n\nMany watch systems incorporate the concept of a dog watch, whereby one watch is split into two shorter watches so that there is an odd number each day. Doing so allows crew members to have a different watch schedule each day. Often, the dog watches are set at dinner time to allow the entire crew to be fed in short order.\n\nThe traditional watch system arose from sailing ships of the late 19th century and was used by the Royal Navy and many other Commonwealth navies. It consisted of 5 four-hour periods and 2 two-hour periods. Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day were assigned to one of two divisions: the Starboard or the Port division. These can be further divided into two parts, e.g. First Port, Second Starboard.\n\nThe Royal Navy traditional submarine three watch system is 2 on 4 off during the day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and 3 on 6 off during the night (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.).\nThe same arrangement of watch times can also be used with a crew divided into three sections. This gives each sailor more time off-duty, sometimes allowing sleeping periods of over seven hours. Names for the three watches—instead of Port and Starboard—vary from ship to ship. Naming schemes such as \"Foremast\", \"Mainmast\" and \"Mizzen\" and \"Red\", \"White\" and \"Blue\" are common.\nThe so-called \"five-and-dime\" arrangement splits the day into five-hour watches, with the exception of a four-hour watch from 22:00 to 02:00. \nThe \"Six-Hour-Shift\" splits the day in four 6-hour watches, permitting a three section crew to maximize rest time in a 3-day working cycle. Also, this watch system takes into better account the meal times (of a 4 meal-a-day system), so that the ingoing team will be fed first, then keep watch, while the outgoing team will be relieved of watch, and then proceed to the messdeck.\n\nAboard United States submarines, the crew is typically divided into three sections, with each section keeping 8 hours of watch followed by 16 hours off-watch. This schedule has been a fairly recent change to submariner work and rest routines. For nearly 45 years prior to 2015, submariners were on 18-hour days with 6 hours of watch followed by 12 hours off watch. The 12 hours off-watch were further divided into the first 6 hours being used for maintenance, cleaning, and entertainment; while the second 6 hours were usually for sleeping.\n\nNote that this arrangement resulted in one of the sections having two watches in one (24-hour) day, and there were no dog watches. Also, watch reliefs occurred no later than the bottom of the hour (2330, 0530, 1130, 1730). Typically, the first 30 minutes of the hour were used for the oncoming section to eat while the second 30 minutes of the hour were used for the off-going section to eat.\nSome warships now use the one-in-two system, also known as 7s and 5s, for the duration of the watches. This watch system is also sometimes referred to as Port and Starboard watches. This gives the sailors a longer sleeping period than the traditional two-watch system, while still maintaining the ability for the ship to function. Meals are generally scheduled around the watch turnovers at 0700, 1200, and 1700; sometimes a light midnight meal known as mid-rats (midnight rations) is provided for the 0000 turnover.\n\nVarious alternative watch schedules have been devised, which are typically referred to as Swedish watches. Although there is no standard for what constitutes a Swedish watch, the variations all feature some element of extended watches to accommodate longer time off. Like the traditional watch system, they begin at 2000 hours. Some popular variations have durations of 6, 6, 4, 4, 4 and 5, 5, 5, 5, 4.\n\nOn merchant ships, watchkeepers typically keep watch for six periods of four consecutive hours. This system has a couple of advantages: it is easy to remember and it is consistent. For example, a member of watch team 1 will only have to remember that he is on the \"4–8\" watch, and knows that he goes on watch at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. This scheme also allows inexperienced watchkeepers to keep watch from 8–12 a.m. and 8–12 p.m., when senior watchkeepers are likely to be awake and ready to assist in case of trouble. \n\nBy custom, in a ship with five deck officers the junior third mate takes the 8 to 12 watch, the senior third mate the 12 to 4 watch, and the second mate the 4 to 8 watch. This enables the second officer, who is the ship's navigator, to take morning and evening star sights. In ships with only four deck officers, the third officer will keep the 8 to 12, the second officer the 12 to 4, and the Chief Mate (equivalent to the Executive Officer in a navy ship) the 4 to 8 watch. The reason for this is to enable the Chief Mate to assign work to the deck gang before the ship's day begins, and to inspect it before going on watch at 1600 hours.\n\nA ship's bell is used in concert with a watch system to indicate the time by means of bell strikes to mark the time and help sailors know when to change watches. Unlike civil clock bells, the strikes of a ship's bell do not accord to the number of the hour. Instead, there are eight bells, one for each half-hour of a four-hour watch. Bells would be struck every half-hour, and in a pattern of pairs for easier counting, with any odd bells at the end of the sequence.\n\n\n\n"}

In isolated cases, individual monarchs sometimes chose to use their state crown instead of the official coronation crown for the crowning, but those cases were exceptions rather than the norm.\n\nSome states where there was no ceremonial coronation only had state crowns, or neither as in Belgium.\n\nThe term \"state crown\" was particularly used in the Kingdom of England and its successor Kingdom of Great Britain to describe the crowns of Kings Charles II and George I that were worn on occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament. While the crown of Charles no longer exists, the jewel-less frame of the State Crown of George I is still kept among the British Crown Jewels.\nBecause they were more frequently in use, in contrast to a coronation crown which was usually only worn once during each reign, state crowns were repeatedly replaced due to wear and tear. \n\nBecause of its age and fragility, the State Crown of George I was replaced in 1838, the new replacement crown was instead called the Imperial State Crown, as was its replacement in 1937. The adjective 'imperial' did not indicate that British Sovereigns were Emperors, even if \"rex in regno suo est imperator\" (the King is Emperor within his own realm), but in medieval European tradition crowns with arches were called Imperial.\n"}

The song was the band's first single, released on 6 August 1979 by record label Small Wonder. It is often considered the first gothic rock record.\n\n\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" was recorded \"live in the studio\" in a single take during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. It was the first thing they recorded together, six weeks after the band had formed. All four band members are credited as writers of the song: vocalist Peter Murphy, guitarist Daniel Ash, drummer Kevin Haskins and bassist David J . David J has claimed that he wrote the lyrics. Alternate versions of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" also included a portion of the early demo recording of their next single, \"Dark Entries\". \n\nFour additional songs were also recorded during the same session: \"Boys\"; \"Bite My Hip\"; \"Some Faces\" and the ska-reggae tune \"Harry\", which was about Deborah Harry, the lead singer of Blondie. Regarding this session, Kevin Haskins said, \"There’s power pop in there, and ska too. We were trying to find our voice.\"\n\nOf the songs recorded during that session (aside from \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\") only \"Harry\" found an official release; in 1982 as a B-side to the single \"Kick in the Eye.\" A version of \"Boys\" recorded at Beck Studios later in 1979 was used as a B-side to the original release of the \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" single. The remaining tracks, including the original recording of \"Boys,\" remained unreleased until 2018 when \"The Bela Session\" was released on vinyl, CD and made available for digital download by the band.\n\nThe song is over nine minutes long; the vocals start (in the studio version) several minutes into the track. The dub-influenced guitar sound was achieved by using partial barre chords and leaving the open.\n\nThe song takes its name from the horror film star Bela Lugosi, who is known for his role as the title character in the 1931 film \"Dracula\". He died in 1956; 23 years before the song was written and recorded.\n\nThe sleeve cover art was taken from the 1926 film \"The Sorrows of Satan\", directed by D. W. Griffith.\n\n\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" was released in August 1979, but did not enter the UK charts. It was released on CD in 1988, and was compiled on the 1998 Bauhaus compilation album \"Crackle\". The original 12\" release was on white vinyl and limited to 5,000 copies. Various other releases are included in the following:\n\n\nIn 2018 the track was released again on vinyl, CD and digital download as part of \"The Bela Session\" along with four other recordings made during the same session in early 1979, three of which were unreleased up to that point.\n\nIn the 1983 horror film \"The Hunger\", Bauhaus performed the song during the opening credits and introduction. A 7″ promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the film.\n\nA live version of the track, released in 1982 and recorded on 24 February 1982 at The Old Vic, London is found on \"Press the Eject and Give Me the Tape\" and the same version is also found on the band's compilation album \"Bauhaus 1979–1983\".\n\nOn the band's 1998 best of album, Crackle a version dubbed the \"Tomb Raider Mix\" is used.\n\n\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" is considered the harbinger of gothic rock music and has been immensely influential on contemporary goth culture.

The bitting instructs a locksmith how to cut a certain key, to replace a lost key or make an additional copy.\n\nThe bitting is usually a series of integers (e.g. 372164) that is usually translated from a key code chart or from a bitting code list to settings on specially designed key machines. In many code systems each digit in the bitting corresponds to a certain location on the key blank where a cut or notch is to be made and also indicates the necessary depth of the cut. \n\nMany lock companies use their own proprietary code system. Depending on the maker, the bitting sequence can be from bow-to-tip (the bow being the larger, handle portion of the key), or can be from tip-to-bow. A smaller number is typically a shallower cut on the key, but not always. Assa bitting codes are reversed, where the higher the digit, the shallower the cut. One American manufacturer, Eagle Lock Company, used letters exclusively for bitting codes.\n\nThis is a type of key where the individual cuts are designed to engage chisel-pointed pins in high-security locking systems manufactured by Medeco and Emhart.

Currently, the school has 325 students in grades 9 to 12, with approximately 70% day students and 30% boarding students.\n\nThe school was founded in 1886 as The Cambridge School for Girls at 20 Mason Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Arthur and Stella Gilman, who had previously helped found Radcliffe College, as a preparatory school for Radcliffe. In 1918, The Cambridge School for Girls merged with the Boston-based Haskell School, and was renamed The Cambridge-Haskell School. Lebanese-born poet Kahlil Gibran, an “intimate friend” of headmistress Mary Haskell, designed a ring for her students depicting a “flower” “growing” in an open “hand.”\n\nIn 1931, the school was moved to its present campus in Weston under the direction of then-head of school John French, became coeducational, and was renamed a final time as The Cambridge School of Weston (CSW). A follower of educational reformer John Dewey, French put in place many of the progressive educational underpinnings that still guide the school, such as a focus on the whole student, experiential learning, community involvement, and a low student-to-faculty ratio. In 1939, the school implemented a form of community self-governance modeled after the traditional New England town meeting. Following Robert's Rules of Order, the entire school community, including students, meet to propose and debate school rules and policies, elect representatives to school committees, and decide on other relevant topics to the community. The Cambridge School Town Meeting continues to be a central part of the school's community governance to the present day.\n\nThe school has gained recognition as a pioneer of the Module System, implemented in 1973 by then Head of School Bob Sandoe.\n\nThe goal of the Module, or \"Mod\" System, is to provide a framework to allow students to focus on fewer subjects more intensively during a given term. The academic year is divided into six terms (known as modules) of six weeks apiece. A school day consists of four class blocks of 90 minutes each, with some classes spanning several consecutive blocks. Students take up to three academic and one extracurricular class per mod. Some classes, such as those in mathematics or a foreign language, continue for multiple mods. No two students have the same schedule; every student's schedule is unique to themselves. Students submit what classes they would like to enroll in, and the faculty works on their schedule to fit their electives into their schedule, along with the required classes each class must participate in.\n\nThe Cambridge School of Weston's tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is $63,000 for boarding and $50,900 for day students.

Though some doubts have been raised about the authenticity of the work, most experts believe that Haydn did compose this concerto.\n\nAlthough the full work was discovered in 1961, Haydn had written the beginning of the principal theme of the first movement in his draft catalogue of 1765.\nThis early work, contemporaneous with symphonies 6, 7 and 8 and predating his D major cello concerto by around twenty years, already shows Haydn as a master of instrumental writing. The solo cello part is thoroughly idiomatic. The concerto reflects the ritornello form of the baroque concerto as well as the emerging structure of the sonata-allegro form. As in the baroque concerto grosso, the accompanying ensemble is small: strings, two oboes, and two horns. It is possible that Weigl was the only cellist in the Esterházy Orchestra when Haydn composed the concerto, since there is only one cello line in the score, marked alternately “solo” and “tutti.” There is also, however, a basso continuo line, that might have been played by another cellist, or by Haydn himself on the harpsichord, or by a string bass player.\n\n\nAll three movements of this work are written in sonata form, unlike the second concerto, where rondo form is used in the second and third movements. This concerto is more related to Haydn's violin concerti than its follower, holding very close resemblance to the Violin Concerto no. 3 in A major, such as the first movement's etched rhythms, and flowing second themes, a peaceful slow movement, and a brisk finale. Both concerti were composed in the same period of time. \n\nAfter the orchestral exposition of the first movement, the solo instrument plays the opening theme with full chords that use all four strings. Virtuosity is developed further in the use of rapidly repeating notes, the very high range, and quick contrasts of register. This movement is dominated by a single theme, although the theme itself includes several motives that Haydn develops separately. Near the end, a cadenza is played. \n\nIn the slow movement (scored without winds), the cello enters dramatically on a long note, played while the orchestral strings relaunch the opening theme. Two measures later the cello goes on to imitate this melody. Haydn was fond of this gesture: several times in the movement the cello enters on a sustained pitch. This movement, like the first, calls for a cadenza toward the end.\n\nThe finale also has the cello enter on a long note, after an extended orchestral introduction. This spirited finale, written in sonata allegro form, represented another chance for Haydn to show what he could do in spinning out a single theme into a series of short motives and a large variety of rapidly changing moods. The virtuosity of the solo instrument is exploited in this movement, especially in passages where the cello alternates rapidly from low to high, so that it seems to be two instruments playing in counterpoint. Haydn uses the sustained-note entrance several times, the final one on a very high, penetrating G.\n\nHaydn's C Major Cello Concerto has become a staple of the cello repertoire, after its 20th century premiere by Miloš Sádlo and the Czechoslovak Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, on 19 May 1962. Many famous artists, including Jacqueline du Pré, Yo-Yo Ma, Julian Lloyd Webber, Pierre Fournier, Truls Mørk, Mstislav Rostropovich, Pieter Wispelwey, Heinrich Schiff, Lynn Harrell, Christine Walevska, Sol Gabetta, Maximilian Hornung, Mischa Maisky, Steven Isserlis, and Sergei Istomin have recorded it.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Michigan House of Representatives, representing the 103rd District. The 103rd District is located in the northern Lower Peninsula and includes all of Iosco, Missaukee, Ogemaw and Roscommon Counties. He was elected on November 2, 2004 to replace outgoing Rep. Dale Sheltrown, his brother.\n\nJoel Sheltrown is a lifelong resident of northern Michigan's Ogemaw County. He graduated from West Branch High School in 1965 and then attended Western Michigan University and Kirtland Community College.\n\nIn 1966, Joel Sheltrown enlisted in the United States Navy and was sent to Viet Nam. He achieved the rank of 2nd Class Petty Officer as a Communications Technician with a Top Secret Crypto Clearance. He received an honorable discharge in 1970 following two tours in Viet Nam, and service in the Philippines and West Germany.\n\nFollowing his wartime military service overseas, Joel Sheltrown returned to West Branch where he managed his father's John Deere dealership. In 1978, he purchased a propane dealership in West Branch. He continued in that business until being elected to the Michigan House of Representatives. Joel Sheltrown is married to Teresa Sheltrown. They have three children: Alison, Nick and Don and two grandchildren.\n\nFollowing the traditions of his politically active family from an early age, Joel Sheltrown served as an Ogemaw Township Trustee from 1978–1988 and as the Ogemaw Township Supervisor from 2000–2004. He has also served as the vice-president of the Ogemaw County chapter of the Michigan Townships Association.\n\nJoel Sheltrown was elected from the 103rd House District to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2004, and subsequently re-elected in 2006 and 2008. Over the three elections, Sheltrown has performed 15 points above the Democratic Party base in the 103rd House District. He is the only Democratic legislative candidate in Michigan history to win a majority of votes in Missaukee County, the second most Republican county in the state.\n\nAs a member of the Democratic majority in the Michigan House of Representatives, Joel Sheltrown was appointed to chair the House Tourism, Outdoor Recreation and Natural Resources Committee in 2007 and re-appointed in 2009. Sheltrown has focused the committee's attention on economic development by increasing funding for promotion of Michigan's tourism industry through the award winning Pure Michigan campaign and by supporting broader recreational opportunity and access. Joel Sheltrown was the primary sponsor of a new state law allowing All-terrain vehicles to access county roads. He organized a hunters' coalition that won broader inclusion of crossbows in the archery deer hunting season.\n\nJoel Sheltrown is a centrist Democrat. He takes traditionally conservative stands on constitutional issues such as the right to life, the Second Amendment, personal freedoms and parental rights. Joel Sheltrown is a life member of the National Rifle Association. He is a supporter of the labor movement, public education and a progressive tax structure. He has been an advocate of a hybrid economic model pursuing both an active state role in job creation and job security and a passive role through the elimination of many regulations that hinder business growth. Sheltrown favors the elimination of the Michigan Business Tax and Michigan's personal property tax and their replacement with either a state Value Added Tax or a progressive consumption tax.\n\nSheltrown founded Northeast Michigan Future, a non-profit economic development advocacy coalition of private sector and public sector partners serving 14 counties in Northeast Michigan from 2009 until 2011. Through his legislative efforts and his guidance of NEMF, he secured a 5 million dollar grant from the State of Michigan. The grant was the major financial piece used for construction of a super hangar used to repair and rebuild wide body aircraft in Oscoda, Michigan. The construction of the hangar resulted in significant numbers of aircraft maintenance jobs previously outsourced to Indonesia and Singapore, to be returned to the United States creating 300 high wage jobs in the area.\n\nIn February 2011, after leaving the House, Sheltrown became Vice-President of Governmental Affairs of Elio Motors. He is responsible for any state or federal statutes or regulations affecting the company and any of its suppliers. He provides language and legislative guidance to legislators and regulatory agencies in numerous states. He also lobbies for the elimination of helmet and motorcycle endorsement requirements.\n\n"}

{"id": "1975412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975412", "title": "WWZZ", "text": "WWZZ\n\nWWZZ/WWVZ were a pair of simulcasting radio stations in Washington, D.C., owned by Bonneville International. The station broadcast from Braddock Heights, Maryland at 103.9 MHz FM and from Waldorf, Maryland, at 104.1 MHz FM. It was commonly known as Z104 with the slogan \"Washington's Modern Music.\" The station was also known for its community efforts and donation drives for local charities. Furthermore, as a member of the Nationals Network, it offered radio coverage of a large portion of the Washington Nationals games.\n\nThe WWZZ/WWVZ simulcast was originally two separately owned and operated stations, starting with WXTR (\"Xtra 104\"), then Washington's heritage Oldies station. WXTR, which had been purchased by Liberty Broadcasting, was soon paired with the Frederick, Maryland-licensed WZYQ 103.9-FM, the original \"Z104\", which had been doing a locally based CHR format in Frederick for years, in an attempt to attain better signal coverage for WXTR. From that point on, both stations operated as a simulcast throughout a variety of formats: first oldies, then all-seventies. Finally, Bonneville purchased the WXTR/WZYQ combo, and changed the format over to CHR at 11 AM on July 11, 1996, as \"Z104\" with the call letters WWZZ/WWVZ. The first song on \"Z104\" was \"Get Ready for This\" by 2 Unlimited and second song was \"Dreams\" by Gabrielle.\n\nThe music was highly researched with an upbeat, high energy presentation and was well received by local audiences. Under consultant Dan Vallie and Program Director/DJ Dale O'Brian, Z104 played a mix of well established top 40 hits along with the best of \"Euro-Pop\" dance music and recurrents from the previous few years, as the market had not had a Top 40 station since WAVA-FM's switch to religious music (eventually switching to religious talk) in 1991. Z104 rocketed into the top 5 in the Washington, DC ratings and often exceeded the cume audience of WPGC. The station was musically vibrant, and over the years, Z104 had some of the best air talent in the country, including Lisa Berigan, Matt Reid, Mathew Blades, Jo Jo Morales and Sean Sellers. Dale O'Brian left the station in 2000 for WBTS/95.5 THE BEAT in Atlanta, Georgia. He was replaced with Mike Edwards, known primarily for his tenure as Program Director of WDCG/G-105 in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThe biggest test for Z104's longevity came in 2001, when Clear Channel Communications-owned station WIHT (Hot 99.5) which played a similar selection of bubblegum pop, alternative rock, hip-hop, and R&B music signed on. WIHT had a very strong signal that covered parts of West Virginia, Virginia, Washington, DC, and west/central Maryland, much of the same area covered by Z-104. WIHT also ran an advertising blitz in the area that included attack style ads targeting Z104 specifically. In one notable but crazy incident a man wearing a Z104 Z-shirt knocked on doors in the DC area and introduced himself as a convicted animal sex offender though it is unclear whether the stunt was authorized by WIHT management or if the individual was trying to win a position with the station.\n\nOn October 1, 2001, with their audience steadily switching to WIHT, Z104 had no choice but to change, and switched to a Modern AC format, playing music by the likes of Dave Matthews Band, Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind, in addition to less-frequent commercial breaks. The format proved an effective alternative to WIHT and to local stations WWDC (DC101) and WHFS (HFS 99.1), both of which specialized in hard rock. The station also dropped the \"Z104\" name in favor of \"More Music 104\" and simply \"104\" for a while, before reverting to the \"Z104\" name on April 8, 2004 at 8:04 AM.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, at Noon, WWZZ went off the air due to a multiple-station format change arranged by Bonneville International. One of the most popular stations in the Washington, D.C., area, all-news station WTOP, expanded its reach by adding 103.5 to its collection, though a new radio station, \"Washington Post Radio\", took over WTOP's previous frequencies on March 30, 2006. The previous occupant of 103.5, the classical music station WGMS, was moved to the Z104 frequencies. The final full song played on \"Z104\" was \"Soul To Squeeze\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers. The opening lyrics of \"I Will Remember You\" by Sarah McLachlan were then played, but the song was cut off by General Manager Joel Oxley announcing the changes, thanking the staff and listeners, and, in a rare move, redirecting former listeners to competing stations in the area.\n\nOne year later, WGMS was shut down (with the music library donated to WETA.) The 104.1 frequency for a short period aired a Jack FM-style variety hits format as \"George FM\", but it was a placeholder format as 104.1 FM was sold. The station is now owned by Radio One, and presently airs an urban gospel format as \"Praise 104.1.\"\n\nZ104's weekday morning program included the Matthew Blades Radio Program on the McDonald's Morning Drive, led by its namesake, Matthew Blades. The show focused on a mix of music, celebrity gossip and interviews, and listener interaction. Other prominent DJs affiliated with the station included Jenni Chase and Music Director Sean Sellers. During weekday evenings the station also broadcast features such as \"Download or Delete It,\" which showcased the newest in music, and \"DC Downloads,\" which lists the top 5 songs that were legally downloaded in the Washington DC area for that day. Weekends featured an hour of coverage dedicated to the local music scene in the Capital Scene program, hosted by Jenni Chase. The station's previous morning programs included one hosted by Billy Bush, the nephew of the 43rd President of the United States, who went on to TV fame as the host of the syndicated entertainment program \"Access Hollywood\", and one hosted by TV sportscaster Brett Haber. Haber was initially paired with female co-host Erin Carman on a program entitled \"Haber & Erin in the Morning\". When Carman was fired for insubordination towards station management in 2004, the title was changed to \"Brett Haber in the Morning\". Haber resigned from the station in mid-2004 to return to television as the Sports Director for Washington's CBS affiliate WUSA.\n\nThe station also hosted a number of live events featuring prominent musicians. The Z104 Lounge programs featured performances and interviews in the Z104 studio itself. Tickets for these events were typically given out through other Z104 programs leading up to the event. Among the performers featured on the Z104 Lounge were Ben Folds, Alanis Morissette and Gavin DeGraw. Audio clips from the Lounge programs were then played back during predetermined weekend hours. In December 2001, Z104 attempted to compete with local radio festivals like the DC101 Chili Cook-Off and HFStival with the one-time Z104 Subway Snowball, which was held at George Mason University's Patriot Center and featured performances by Five for Fighting, The Calling, Train and Barenaked Ladies. The Z104 Bosom Ball was held in 2003 at Washington's famed , benefiting George Washington University's mobile mammogram program and featuring performances by Guster and Third Eye Blind. A follow-up in 2004 featured Pat McGee Band and Bowling for Soup, and the third and final incarnation in 2005 featured Better Than Ezra, Vertical Horizon and Hootie and the Blowfish.\n\nIn October 2002, following the Beltway Sniper attacks that terrorized the Washington area for weeks, Z104 held a 24-hour Request-a-Thon to raise money for the victims and/or their families. Listeners would call in with a request for any song of any genre and pledge a minimum of $25 to the Salvation Army. The event was such a success that it became an annual happening, with future Request-a-Thons benefiting Ronald McDonald House, plus a special one held after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005 for the victims of that catastrophe (the minimum donation was raised from 2003 onward to $500 for unsigned local bands seeking an avenue of exposure).\n\nBroadcasts on each day of the week had a certain theme associated with them, which changed the music played throughout the day.\n\nTheir weekend tagline was \"It's the weekend and you gotta be on the Z, Z104!!\"\n\n\n\n \n"}

When King Ramathibodi ascended to the throne of Ayuthaya, he sent King Ramesuan to reign in Lavo. Upon King Ramathibodi's death in 1369, King Ramesuan traveled to Ayutthaya to assume the throne, but held it for less than a year before being deposed by his uncle, King Borommaracha I, the ruler of Suphanburi. Sources differ over the nature of their conflict; official chronicles state that the older Boromaracha ruled with the willing consent of his nephew, while Jeremias van Vliet's \"Short History of Thailand\" indicated that Boromaracha's ascension came only after a bloody conflict bordering on civil war.\n\nWhatever the case, by 1388 King Ramesuan had gathered sufficient support from his power base in Lavo to return to Ayutthaya and challenge Boromarachi's 17-year-old son Thong Lan for the throne. King Ramesuan's forces quickly took the palace and executed Thong Lan. King Ramesuan then held the throne until 1395, when he was succeeded by his son Rama (also known as Ramaracha).\n\nDuring King Ramesuan's second reign, the king seems to have come to an understanding with the kingdom of Sukhothai, against whom Boromaracha had warred throughout his reign. Instead, some sources record conflicts with the kingdom of Lan Na (in northern Thailand), and the empire of Angkor. Ayutthaya chronicles indicate that King Ramesuan took Chiang Mai, then the capital of the kingdom of Lan Na, in 1390 and settled many captives within the kingdom of Ayutthaya.\n\nA similar defeat of Angkor is recorded as having taken place in 1393, in response to raids from the Cambodian kingdom. He placed his son on the throne but he was soon assassinated. Neither of these battles are attested to by chronicles from Lan Na or Angkor.\n\n"}

Wade\". The Court held that respect for human dignity requires the criminalization of abortion if it is not justified by imperative reasons called indications (\"Indikationen\"). There are several indications, most notably the medical indication, meaning that the life of the mother would be at risk if she had to carry the child to term, and the criminal indication, meaning that the child is the result of the mother being raped.\n\nThe decision considered the full range of arguments for abortion, both early (legalization had been a topic of debate in Germany since the turn of the century) and recent (used in other countries such as the United States and Britain that legalized abortion several years before). In particular, it specifically rejected the main points of reasoning in \"Roe v. Wade\" as well as its \"term solution\" as inconsistent with the constitutional guarantee of the right to life. \nThe Court held that the right to life, as guaranteed by Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Law, must extend to the life of the unborn when read in the light of the guarantee of human dignity as laid out in Article 1 of the Basic Law.\n\nThe reunification of Germany resulted in a significant revision of abortion laws, which liberalized them in many respects, although leaving them more restrictive than the East German laws which permitted abortion upon demand during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. In the early 1990s, the Bundestag implemented a system where a woman having an abortion during the first three months of her pregnancy does not face legal sanctions if she undergoes mandatory counseling which has as one of its goals to present the case that the developing fetus is an independent human life, and obeys a 72-hour waiting period between counseling and the abortion. Later abortions are not punishable if medical reasons, such as possible harm to the woman from continued pregnancy, or a severely deformed fetus, indicate so.\nIn a second judgment in 1992, the Federal Constitutional Court upheld these relaxed restrictions on abortion. The Court no longer considered that the defense of the unborn human beings' right to life (in itself upheld) necessarily implies the \"punishment\" of abortion: while it is, according to the court, a constitutional mandate to protect unborn life, it is not constitutionally specified which means to use to do so. Thus, the simple legislator (that is, the legislator below constitutional level) is - within limits - free to choose among them, including the choice of \"social, political, and welfare means\" over penal measures.\n\n\n"}

Salt is a necessity of life and was a mineral that was used since ancient times in many cultures as a seasoning, a preservative, a disinfectant, a component of ceremonial offerings, and as a unit of exchange. The Bible contains numerous references to salt. In various contexts, it is used metaphorically to signify permanence, loyalty, durability, fidelity, usefulness, value, and purification.\n\nThe main source of salt in the region was the area of the Dead Sea, especially the massive salt cliffs of Jebel Usdum, about long. The face of the ridge is constantly changing as weather interacts with the rock salt. highlights the importance of the Dead Sea's salt.\n\nThe Hebrew people harvested salt by pouring sea water into pits and letting the water evaporate until only salt was left. They used the mineral for seasoning and as a preservative. In addition, salt was used to disinfect wounds.\nIn King Abijah referred to God's covenant promise to David that he will not lack a man to seat on Israel's throne as a salt covenant, a covenant that can never be broken.\n\nThe fate of Lot's wife, being turned to a pillar of salt, is found in . This is the reason for the naming of the pillar on Mount Sodom, which is often called \"Lot's Wife\".\n\nSalt was cast on the burnt offering (Ezekiel ) and was part of the incense (Exodus ). Part of the temple offering included salt (Ezra ).\n\nSalt was widely and variably used as a symbol and sacred sign in ancient Israel and illustrate salt as a covenant of friendship. In cultures throughout the region, the eating of salt is a sign of friendship. Salt land is a metaphorical name for a desolate no man's land, as attested in , , and . The land of defeated cities was salted to consecrate them to a god and curse their re-population, as illustrated in .\n\nNewborn babies were rubbed with salt. A reference to this practice is in Ezekiel : \"As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.\"\n\nThe Salt and Light passages in the Sermon on the Mount make reference to salt. Matthew's account differs slightly from that of Luke and Mark. refers to his disciples as \"the salt of the earth.\" This meaning is paralleled in the following verse, , in the symbolism of the \"light of the world.\" Another view is that the Salt and Light passages refer to a duality of roles in the disciples to be like a light from a city, viewable from all over the world, and to be spread out as salt is: to congregate and spread. Matthew, Mark, and Luke accord in the discussion of salt \"that has lost its taste.\" This is a reference to salt that is contaminated with other minerals, causing a weakness in flavor or a bland unpleasant taste. It may be a symbolic reference to the possibility of abandoning or deviating from the gospel, especially due to the adulteration of its teachings. Another interpretation is that in a world filled with sin and deceit, it is possible for one to become contaminated and thus unsuccessful at being an effective disciple. Therefore, this verse serves as a warning for disciples to be on their guard; to be in the world, but not of the world.\n\n\n"}

The monument was constructed in his memory. It was designed by J.P. Parker and paid for from public funds.\n\nOn 9 August 1969 it was rededicated to the memory of the martyrs of the Indian freedom movement and renamed the \"\"Shaheed Minar\",\" which means \"martyrs' monument\" in both Bengali and Hindi, by the then United Front Government in memory of the martyrs of the Indian independence movement. The present government has decided to illuminate the tower during evenings and allow visitors to the top. The last people to have been up there were former governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and his family.\n\nEntitled as the \"\"Cloud kissing Monument\"\" by Mark Twain, the Shaheed Minar is located at Esplanade in Central Kolkata in the north-east facet of the Maidan. The tower is high. It has a foundation based on the Egyptian style. The column is a combination of styles with a classical fluted column, a Syrian upper portion, and a Turkish dome. It has two balconies at the top. The top floor of the minar is accessible by a serpentine staircase, a total of 223 steps. It has a total of 218 steps until the top of the tower.\n\nThe monument was erected by Burn & Company.\n\nThe vast field to the south of Shaheed Minar, is known as the Shaheed Minar Maidan or the Brigade Ground. It has a history of being the site of political rallies and fairs. The first political meeting on the ground was presided over by Rabindranath Tagore to condemn the killing of a youth in Hijli by the British in 1931. The central bus terminus of the city is around the monument.\n\nIn 1997, a tourist jumped off the lower balcony of the monument. Since then, police permission is required to climb the steps of the monument. Local residents must submit proof of address and a photo ID at the Lalbazar Police Headquarters, while out-of-town tourists must submit documents from their hotel, and foreigners must submit a copy of their passport.\n\nThe monument offers a bird's-eye view of the city, and is similar to the London Eye. The government has planned to open the monument to the public, after the renovation work is completed. The renovation work was started in late 2011 and will be completed in two phases. The first phase was scheduled to be completed by June 15, 2012, and is said to cost about 50lakhs. There are also plans to illuminate the monument, both from inside and outside, and to give the monument a fresh coat of paint. In the second phase a temporary folding stage will be set up at the foot of the tall monument to avoid congestion at the Dorina Crossing during rallies.\n\nAfter the work is completed, both tourists and locals will have access to the top of the monument.

Clay National Guard Center\n\nGeneral Lucius D. Clay National Guard Center (formerly Naval Air Station Atlanta) is a military facility located south of Marietta, Georgia, United States. It is located immediately south of Dobbins Air Reserve Base and shares its runways.\n\nBefore 1959, Naval Air Station Atlanta was located at what is now Peachtree Dekalb Airport, located northeast of Atlanta in Dekalb County. It operated until 26 SEP 2009 when the base closed its doors. The property is now owned by the state of Georgia as the new headquarters for the Georgia State Department of Defense.\nThe Navy's website for NAS Atlanta was deleted soon after the transfer.\n\nIn April 1955, Congress appropriated more than $4 million to start building a new Naval Air Station at a more suitable location to allow longer runways. The site selected was a large military reservation jointly occupied by Dobbins Air Force Base and the Lockheed Company, between Marietta and Smyrna. The new air station was completed in April 1959. \nNAS Atlanta was originally located at what is now Peachtree-DeKalb Airport in Chamblee, until it moved in 1958. The Southern Technical Institute took over the barracks there, and it too moved in 1958 to Marietta, just on the other side of Dobbins AFB.\nNaval Air Station Atlanta's mission was to train Navy and Marine Corps Reservists assigned to numerous aviation and non-aviation reserve units. The command organization was made of more than 900 active duty military and civilian personnel. NAS Atlanta was the home of Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 42, Carrier Air Wing Reserve Twenty, three Navy squadrons (flying the F/A-18, E-2 and C-9 aircraft), two Marine Corps squadrons (flying the F/A-18 aircraft, and AH-1W and UH-1 helicopters) as well as several other commands. In 2005, DoD recommended NAS Atlanta for closure and its constituent units relocated or consolidated at other installations.\n\nLike NAS Willow Grove and NAF Washington/Andrews AFB, NAS Atlanta offers superb convenience and thus recruiting opportunities to the services’ reserve components, at some cost in operational flexibility. In the case of NAF Atlanta, that cost is imposed primarily in terms of airspace access.\n\nThe F/A-18s assigned to VFA-203 and VMFA-142 faced one of the more difficult airspace access challenges in the DoN. Operations at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport impose a significant impact on surrounding airspace. Atlanta functions as a 360 degree hub, with approach, departure, bypass or overflight traffic using virtually all available airspace within of the facility. The airspace northeast of Atlanta is probably the most congested, as it must accommodate departures and arrivals between Atlanta and cities in the northeast. Unfortunately, the primary airspace available to NAF Atlanta units, the Snowbird MOA/ATCAA lies in that quadrant.\n\nThe Air Station was proudly awarded the Edwin F. Conway Trophy in 1987, 1993 for being the most efficient Naval Air Station in the Naval Reserve, and the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department (AIMD) won the Commander, Naval Reserve Force Robert S. Gray Maintenance Excellence Award in 1987 and 1992. In 1990 the air station was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for unprecedented accomplishments, consistent performance and unswerving dedication to duty. Other awards between 1988 and 1993 include: Secretary of Navy Energy Conservation Award; major claimant nominations for the Bronze Hammer Award, nomination for the Commander in Chief's Installation Excellence Award, and the 1992 Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force Safety Ashore Award.\n\nNAS Atlanta is also the site of the Navy Lake Site, a military recreation area open to active, reserve, and retired military, located in a park on Lake Allatoona reservoir. Not to be outdone, the Army has its own Lake Allatoona Army Recreation Area, an resort on another part of the same lake at nearby Ft. McPherson.\n\nNAS Atlanta closed its doors on 26 September 2009 in a base closing ceremony. The property was then turned over to the Georgia State Department of Defense for use as its new main base of operations.\n\nIn 2007, the state of Georgia announced that it had acquired the NAS Atlanta property as the new headquarters for the Georgia Army National Guard. This preceded plans for units in the remote corners of the state to consolidate at the base.\n\nThe first Georgia Army National Guard aircraft assigned to the new installation, a HH-60M Blackhawk, arrived on 25 August 2009. It was delivered to the 1/111 Medevac Unit fresh from the production line.\n\nOn 26 September 2009, the Georgia National Guard assumed ownership of the former Naval Air Station Atlanta at a formal transfer of facilities ceremony. The transfer was the result of the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission report which recommended closing the 50-year-old Marietta base. Captain Chuck Mingonet officially turned over the base to General Nesbitt, Adjutant General of the Georgia State Department of Defense. Commander, Navy Region Southeast, Rear Admiral Tim Alexander was in attendance along with many other flag officers and dignitaries. Governor Sonny Perdue, members of Georgia's Congressional delegation and state legislature, as well as local dignitaries including Chairman Sam Olens and Commissioner Bob Ott, were on hand for the event. The facility's name was also changed to the General Lucius D. Clay National Guard Center in honor of the World War II hero and coordinator of the Berlin Airlift. Clay was a Cobb County native. Following the ceremony, Georgia National Guard also held a groundbreaking for its new Joint Force Headquarters. The headquarters is scheduled for completion in 2012. More than 1,500 Georgia Guard soldiers and airmen will perform training on the property in the future.\n\n\n"}

Usually it is applied in the context of semiparametric models, where the parameter of interest is finite-dimensional, whereas the full shape of the data's distribution function may not be known, and therefore maximum likelihood estimation is not applicable.\n\nThe method requires that a certain number of \"moment conditions\" were specified for the model. These moment conditions are functions of the model parameters and the data, such that their expectation is zero at the parameters' true values. The GMM method then minimizes a certain norm of the sample averages of the moment conditions, and can therefore be thought of as a special case of minimum-distance estimation.\n\nThe GMM estimators are known to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient in the class of all estimators that do not use any extra information aside from that contained in the moment conditions.\n\nGMM was developed by Lars Peter Hansen in 1982 as a generalization of the method of moments, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1894. Hansen shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics in part for this work.\n\nSuppose the available data consists of \"T\" observations , where each observation \"Y\" is an \"n\"-dimensional multivariate random variable. We assume that the data come from a certain statistical model, defined up to an unknown parameter . The goal of the estimation problem is to find the “true” value of this parameter, \"θ\", or at least a reasonably close estimate.\n\nA general assumption of GMM is that the data \"Y\" be generated by a weakly stationary ergodic stochastic process. (The case of independent and identically distributed (iid) variables \"Y\" is a special case of this condition.)\n\nIn order to apply GMM, we need to have \"moment conditions\", that is, we need to know a vector-valued function \"g\"(\"Y\",\"θ\") such that\nwhere E denotes expectation, and \"Y\" is a generic observation. Moreover, the function \"m\"(\"θ\") must differ from zero for , otherwise the parameter \"θ\" will not be point-identified.\n\nThe basic idea behind GMM is to replace the theoretical expected value E[⋅] with its empirical analog—sample average:\nand then to minimize the norm of this expression with respect to \"θ\". The minimizing value of \"θ\" is our estimate for \"θ\".\n\nBy the law of large numbers, formula_3 for large values of \"T\", and thus we expect that formula_4. The generalized method of moments looks for a number formula_5 which would make formula_6 as close to zero as possible. Mathematically, this is equivalent to minimizing a certain norm of formula_7 (norm of \"m\", denoted as ||\"m\"||, measures the distance between \"m\" and zero). The properties of the resulting estimator will depend on the particular choice of the norm function, and therefore the theory of GMM considers an entire family of norms, defined as\nwhere \"W\" is a positive-definite weighting matrix, and formula_9 denotes transposition. In practice, the weighting matrix \"W\" is computed based on the available data set, which will be denoted as formula_10. Thus, the GMM estimator can be written as\n\nUnder suitable conditions this estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal, and with right choice of weighting matrix formula_10 also asymptotically efficient.\n\nConsistency is a statistical property of an estimator stating that, having a sufficient number of observations, the estimator will converge in probability to the true value of parameter:\nSufficient conditions for a GMM estimator to be consistent are as follows:\n\nThe second condition here (so-called Global identification condition) is often particularly hard to verify. There exist simpler necessary but not sufficient conditions, which may be used to detect non-identification problem:\n\nIn practice applied econometricians often simply \"assume\" that global identification holds, without actually proving it.\n\nAsymptotic normality is a useful property, as it allows us to construct confidence bands for the estimator, and conduct different tests. Before we can make a statement about the asymptotic distribution of the GMM estimator, we need to define two auxiliary matrices:\nThen under conditions 1–6 listed below, the GMM estimator will be asymptotically normal with limiting distribution:\n\nformula_23\n\nConditions:\n\nSo far we have said nothing about the choice of matrix \"W\", except that it must be positive semi-definite. In fact any such matrix will produce a consistent and asymptotically normal GMM estimator, the only difference will be in the asymptotic variance of that estimator. It can be shown that taking\nwill result in the most efficient estimator in the class of all asymptotically normal estimators. Efficiency in this case means that such an estimator will have the smallest possible variance (we say that matrix \"A\" is smaller than matrix \"B\" if \"B–A\" is positive semi-definite).\n\nIn this case the formula for the asymptotic distribution of the GMM estimator simplifies to\n\nThe proof that such a choice of weighting matrix is indeed optimal is often adopted with slight modifications when establishing efficiency of other estimators. As a rule of thumb, a weighting matrix is optimal whenever it makes the “sandwich formula” for variance collapse into a simpler expression.\n\nOne difficulty with implementing the outlined method is that we cannot take because, by the definition of matrix Ω, we need to know the value of \"θ\" in order to compute this matrix, and \"θ\" is precisely the quantity we do not know and are trying to estimate in the first place. In the case of \"Y\" being iid we can estimate \"W\" as\n\nSeveral approaches exist to deal with this issue, the first one being the most popular:\n\nAsymptotically no improvement can be achieved through such iterations, although certain Monte-Carlo experiments suggest that finite-sample properties of this estimator are slightly better.\nIn Monte-Carlo experiments this method demonstrated a better performance than the traditional two-step GMM: the estimator has smaller median bias (although fatter tails), and the J-test for overidentifying restrictions in many cases was more reliable.\n\nAnother important issue in implementation of minimization procedure is that the function is supposed to search through (possibly high-dimensional) parameter space \"Θ\" and find the value of \"θ\" which minimizes the objective function. No generic recommendation for such procedure exists, it is a subject of its own field, numerical optimization.\n\nWhen the number of moment conditions is greater than the dimension of the parameter vector \"θ\", the model is said to be \"over-identified\". Over-identification allows us to check whether the model's moment conditions match the data well or not.\n\nConceptually we can check whether formula_36 is sufficiently close to zero to suggest that the model fits the data well. The GMM method has then replaced the problem of solving the equation formula_37, which chooses formula_38 to match the restrictions exactly, by a minimization calculation. The minimization can always be conducted even when no formula_20 exists such that formula_40. This is what J-test does. The J-test is also called a \"test for over-identifying restrictions\".\n\nFormally we consider two hypotheses:\n\nUnder hypothesis formula_43, the following so-called J-statistic is asymptotically \"chi-squared\" distributed with \"k–l\" degrees of freedom. Define \"J\" to be:\n\nwhere formula_24 is the GMM estimator of the parameter formula_20, \"k\" is the number of moment conditions (dimension of vector \"g\"), and \"l\" is the number of estimated parameters (dimension of vector \"θ\"). Matrix formula_48 must converge in probability to formula_49, the efficient weighting matrix (note that previously we only required that \"W\" be proportional to formula_49 for estimator to be efficient; however in order to conduct the J-test \"W\" must be exactly equal to formula_49, not simply proportional).\n\nUnder the alternative hypothesis formula_52, the J-statistic is asymptotically unbounded:\n\nTo conduct the test we compute the value of \"J\" from the data. It is a nonnegative number. We compare it with (for example) the 0.95 quantile of the\nformula_55 distribution:\n\nMany other popular estimation techniques can be cast in terms of GMM optimization:\n\n\\beta)\\,]=0</math>\n\n\n\n"}

Compare Ovid \"Fasti\" 5, 616: \"inque deum de bove versus erat\", \"he had been changed from an ox into a god\", or Juvenal 7, 197: \"fies de rhetore consul\", \"from an orator you will become a consul\". \"Oppresso\" is the past participle of \"opprimere\" (\"to oppress\") in the ablative case as governed by \"de\", meaning \"an oppressed person\". The adjective \"Liber\" is in the nominative case, \"a free person\".\n\nThe motto resembles a quote from St. Augustine: \"corripiendi sunt inquieti, [...] oppressi liberandi\", \"the turbulent have to be corrected, [...] the oppressed to be liberated\". See also Isaiah 1:17:\" subvenite oppresso\", \"relieve the oppressed\".\n\nThe phrase stems from the exploits of World War II Office of Strategic Services Jedburgh/Sussex Teams operating behind the lines in France. Colonel Aaron Bank, father of United States Army Special Forces, and his teams enabled the French Resistance to grow and oppose the occupying German Army. The unconventional warfare tactics of Colonel Bank differed from the conventional warfare tactics of the rest of the United States Army in that they included clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict and that they were subversive to the Nazi forces in power.\n\nThe sculpture \"America's Response Monument\" is subtitled \"De Oppresso Liber\". It is a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue located in the West Street lobby of One World Financial Center opposite Ground Zero in New York City. Unofficially known as the \"Horse Soldier Statue\", it is the first public monument dedicated to the United States Special Forces and commemorates the servicemen and women of America’s Special Operations response to 9/11, including those who fought in the early days of Operation Enduring Freedom, which led to the initial defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was conceived by a private citizen, sculptor Douwe Blumberg, and commissioned by an anonymous group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe statue was dedicated on November 11, 2011 in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lt. Gen. John Mulholland, commander of Special Operations Command.\n\nThe distinct unit insignia inspired that of the 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade of Iran, the establishment of which was assisted by advisors from the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School before the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\n\n"}

{"id": "1975578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975578", "title": "Ely Buendia", "text": "Ely Buendia\n\nEleandre \"Ely\" Basiño Buendia (born November 2, 1970) is a Filipino musician, writer and director who gained fame as guitarist, songwriter and lead vocalist of the popular Filipino rock band Eraserheads. Widely regarded as one of the most respected music icons in the country, his compositions gained massive commercial success and universal critical acclaim, topping various music charts and leaving a legacy in Philippine popular culture. He currently performs as guitarist and lead vocalist for Apartel.\n\nEly Eleandre Basiño Buendia was born in his parents' home in Naga City at 6:20 am on November 2, 1970. He is the second child of Ely Revilla Buendia (born c. 1942 in Goa, Camarines Sur) and Lisetta Ruiz Basiño (March 22, 1942 in Caramoan, Camarines Sur – August 28, 2008 in Manila). His parents were married on October 30, 1964 in Ragay, Camarines Sur. He first learned Kundiman from his mother while he started playing the guitar at the age of 7 years old. Buendia graduated from Elementary in Pasig Catholic College in 1983 in Pasig City and High School in University of Perpetual Help Rizal. Buendia later enrolled to University of the Philippines Diliman where he formed his bands Bluidie Tryste, Sunday School and Eraserheads.\n\nBuendia has two children, Una Aurea, with his first wife, Vicky Cayago, and Eon Drake, with Pupil co-manager Diane Ventura. He had a relationship with Andi Trinidad of Mega Magazine and reportedly also used to date TV5 news anchor and model Shawn Yao.\n\nIn December 1989, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan, Marcus Adoro and Buddy Zabala formed the band Eraserheads in their collegiate school, the University of the Philippines Diliman, where Buendia was a Film major at the College of Mass Communications (he started his first year of college in 1987). The band found that they weren't good at covering other people's hits, so they concentrated on writing their own material instead. In 1991, Buendia explained, \"After all, if we committed a mistake no one would recognize it since they don't know the song, right?\" Performing their original songs live soon earned them a cult following in the University, which gradually spread outside the campus. One of the songs, a pop song entitled \"Pare Ko\", which Buendia wrote, became very popular, partly because of the lyrics which included a few swear words.\n\nEraserheads eventually signed a three-year deal with BMG Pilipinas. Their debut album \"Ultraelectromagneticpop!\" featured no less than \"Pare Ko\" and a host of other novelty pieces that had people listening and discovering more about the quartet. The album also brought the underground college rock scene into public awareness. 1993 saw the emergence of \"Eraserheadsmania\" because of successive hit singles, sold-out concerts and thousands of fans.\n\nBuendia continued to write songs for the band, many of which became hit singles and classics. Eraserheads lasted for ten years before finally breaking up with Buendia and Adoro's departure. During those 10 years, the band produced eight studio albums along with other EPs and singles. Their gigs took them out of the country, with tours in the United States and other countries. One album, \"Aloha Milkyway\", was released in the Asian region. Eraserheads were also the first ever Filipino artists to receive the \"Moon Man\" trophy for winning the 1997 MTV Asia Viewer's Choice Award for the video of their song, \"Ang Huling El Bimbo\". This hit was also written by Buendia, like many others that the band produced.\n\nEraserheads went onstage for their reunion concert on August 30, 2008 at the Fort Open Field, Taguig City, which was cut short unexpectedly. The continuation of the concert was held at the SM Mall of Asia Concert Grounds on March 7, 2009.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, it was confirmed that Buendia had left the band in mid-March 2002 for \"reasons unknown\". However, in subsequent interviews, Buendia referred to business matters as the cause of the band's break-up.\n\nIn an interview, Marasigan said he was eating in SM Megamall, a local shopping mall, when he heard of the news (how he heard of it, was not clear). He said he was \"semi-surprised\" and wondered if Zabala already knew about it. Adoro told of the story now famous among Eraserheads fans about Buendia's cryptic text message. He said Buendia stated in the text message that it's already time to graduate. Adoro quipped in the same interview that Buendia being the first to graduate was natural, since he was in batch 1987 in their school (UP, Diliman), while they were in batch 1988.\n\nZabala confesses in an interview that disbanding had not been that far away from the members' minds. He said that there were so many occasions where they could have disbanded but they did not. Adoro expressed the belief of some people that the band was getting too old and that it was \"selfish\" for the band to continue, likely referring to comments about how it's time for other bands besides Eraserheads to shine. The band made it clear, though, that Buendia's departure from the band wasn't in any way violent and there was no shouting (\"sigawan\") or any confrontation.\n\nWithout giving up, the three remaining original Eraserheads decided to continue on. Within just a few weeks, the \"new\" Eheads debuted at Hard Rock Cafe in Makati City on April 19 featuring a female singer-guitarist, Kris Gorra-Dancel from the band, Fatal Posporos. However, after a few months, Adoro also quit the band. The remaining members of Eraserheads added Diego Mapa and Ebe Dancel to their lineup and renamed their band, \"Cambio\".\n\nAfter Ely left Eraserheads, he would invite musicians and jam together. He had no definite line-up at that time, \"I have, like, 10 members in the band right now. I have two drummers, two bass players...\" according to Ely in an interview with Martin Nievera. This jamming together with friends would eventually evolve into The Mongols. It was composed of guitarist J. Astro (also known as Jerome Velasco) (of The Teeth), bassist Yan Yuzon, drummer Bogs \"Boga Man\" Jugo (of the indie pop band Daydream Cycle), and Buendia on guitars and vocals, under the stage name Jesus \"Dizzy\" Ventura. The band was managed by Day Cabuhat, one of Eraserheads' former managers. \nAccording to one of Eraserhead's event producers, Ely's \"Jesus\" stage name was from an inside joke during Eraserhead's US Tour. Ely and Marcus bought replica sheriff badges at the Universal Studios Hollywood and Ely got a badge with the name \"Jesus\" while Marcus' was \"Cesar\".\n\nThe Mongols released a self-produced underground EP in CD-R format with factory-printed sleeves in April 2003, \"A Fraction of A Second\". It contains five tracks, \"Case Logic\", \"No\", \"Tomorrowland\", \"KSP\" and \"Abstraction of A Second\". It was released under Redrum Records.\n\nAfter a few months, the Mongols decided to have their self-produced album distributed by Neo Records Inc. under the major label VIVA Records. The result is a thirteen-track album called \"Buddha's Pest\". Its tracks include \"Keeper\", \"Bulakbol\", \"Bakit Nga Ba?\", \"Pony\", \"Teka Muna\", \"Candy Flip\", \"Heroine\", \"Wig Out\", \"It's Over\", \"Irish Spring\", \"Odd Even\", \"Your Bushido\", plus an untitled instrumental track. It was produced by The Genghis Klan under Criminal Records.\n\nShortly after The Mongols' guitarist, J. Astro, left the band, the remaining members renamed their group Pupil. Buendia chanced upon the band name while reading a medical book. The band is enjoying more mainstream popularity, in contrast to the Mongols. Bogs left the band after their 1st album \"Beautiful Machines\". Wendell is now the drummer of Pupil. Recently, Pupil's guitarist Yanny Yuzon also left the band in 2013. Day Cabuhat Pupil's Manager said that \"Yanny is no longer. Transitions and changes are normal within any band structure and we all thank you for the understanding and continued support of all of our projects...\"\n\nThe band consists of Ely Buendia as the frontman, Nitoy Adriano as the lead guitarist, Chris Padilla also in Guitars, Ivan Garcia on bass and Bobby Padilla on drums. \"Nitoy Adriano is a former member of quintessential Filipino rock band The Jerks. They are the original alternative and blues band of the Philippines. Current and past members are considered icons in the local music scene,\" MCA Music, Inc. said. \"Chris Padilla, Bobby Padilla and Ivan Garcia are actually a three piece rockabilly group called Hilera. They may be new players in the scene compared to the other two members but they have already made quite an impact by winning the Nescafe sound school competition in 2005 and by being nominated and winning various rock awards,\" MCA added.\n\nHow the band was formed, MCA Music, Inc. said, \"The members have collaborated several times before most notably when Hilera took part in the production of Buendia's project with Francis Magalona entitled 'In Love and War'. However, the band was officially formed almost exactly a year ago when they first went onstage as \"Oktaves\" when they performed at the inaugural Esquire (magazine) ball.\"\n\"The collaboration turned into a headlining band which now plays in the best rock venues in the country. They now have a repertoire of original songs and also perform a good number of classic rock anthems. Oktaves' brand of music is straight up rock n' roll. Their music is very relatable to various audiences of different generations. Whilst their sound is classy and sophisticated, they are also very appealing to the mainstream crowd,\" MCA Music Inc. said.\n\nTheir 1st album was the self-titled album \"The Oktaves\" it has 12 tracks including their 1st single \"K.U.P.A.L (K.P.L)\", their another single \"Paakyat ka pa lang, Pababa na ako\" and the song \"Bungo Sa Bangin\" by Ely Buendia feat. Turbogoth and Pepe Smith from the album \"Rock Rizal\", an album tribute for José Rizal, it consist of Various Artists including Ely Buendia.\n\nIn 2016, Buendia launched a new band with Jay Ortega (of DRT, Gnash, Wally Gonzalez, and Tres), which is primarily focused on soul music, RnB, funk, and semblances of jazz. Buendia met Ortega during the latter's launch of his bar and cafe called Spin Cafe. The two later collaborated and started to form a group, with members and contributors Pat Sarabia (drums), Coco Coo (guitars), RJ Pineda (keyboards), Redge Concepcion (guitars), Louie Talan (bass), Carissa Ramos (bass), Deej Rodriguez (percussion), Roxy Modesto (saxophone), Wowie Ansano (trumpet), Pards Tupas (trombone), Joseph Cabañero (saxophone), Donna Sagun Señoran(harp and backup vocals), and Ramonne Rodriguez (backup vocals). Buddy Zabala (bass), Nitoy Adriano (guitars), Cooky Chua (backup vocals), Wendell Garcia (drums), and the group Bras Pas Pas Pas (horns), also shared their expertise to the band's album tracks. Entitled \"Inner Play\", the band's first album was released digitally on September 29, 2016. The double album 45RPM vinyl version was manufactured in Japan, and the band opted not to release in CD format due to piracy and decreasing number of CD users, which was released on November 12, 2016 at the HiFi Show, Dusit Thani Hotel. Inner Play will be released under Buendia and Ortega's own record label called Offshore Music. According to Buendia in an interview with Myx, their band name was inspired by the 1980s new wave band, The Motels. However, according to Buendia, Apartel's sound is a tribute to 1970s music, such as Stax Records, Motown, Manila Sound, APO Hiking Society, VST & Co., and Rico J. Puno. The band launched its first music video for their single \"Is It Hip?\" on September 17, 2016, in Victoria Court, Malate, and was directed by Marie Jamora and produced by Artikulo Uno Productions. The band also covers songs from its influences such as Sly & Family Stone's \"Thank You For Talking To Me Africa\". The band released Inner Play (Remixes) in 2017. Its latest album, \"Full Flood\", was released in 2018.\n\nOn January 7,2007, Sunday, Ely Buendia suffered a heart attack or acute myocardial infarction secondary to arterial blockage. It began when Buendia complained about finding it a bit hard to breathe while they were on the way to a gig in Laguna. But he dismissed it as mere heartburn. After some time, Buendia was reportedly in the middle of a song during a gig in Calamba, Laguna when he felt a sudden pain in his chest and left arm. He was rushed to an intensive care unit at the Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Alabang, Muntinlupa. \"It turns out that he'd been having a heart attack for the last twenty five hours.\" according to ex-eheads manager Jessica Zafra. Doctors performed an angiogram on the frontman and it confirmed the heart attack as two of his arteries were blocked. Buendia's condition was confirmed stable after an emergency angioplasty operation headed by Dr. Benjie Luna during the same night. According to Dok Sergio, \"Ely is fine, successful \"yung\" surgery last night. (Last night's surgery was a success).\"\n\nThe second angioplasty operation conducted on Ely Buendia on January 10, 2007 was successful and is secured from having heart attack recurrence. \"The operation was a super success. He is totally out of danger and heart attack recurrence is not expected.\" according to Buendia's attending physician and cardiac surgeon, Dr. Wilfred Dee.\n\nOn behalf of Pupil, Ms. Day Cabuhat and Diane Ventura gave thanks to everyone who called, visited and expressed their concerns to Ely's condition such us fans, writers, editors, media, sponsors, networks, producers, and most especially to local musicians such as Yael Yuzon, Japs Sergio, Francis Magalona, Parokya ni Edgar, Kamikazee, Kiko Machine, Menaya, Rico Blanco, Urbandub, Buddy Zabala, Marcus Adoro and many others.\n\nBuendia was finally released from the Hospital and was allowed to stay at home and rest by his doctors on the night of January 15, 2007. \"I've got a bionic heart now,\" joked by Buendia.\n\nThis event prompted rap artist Francis Magalona, a longtime friend of Buendia and the other Eraserheads, to state the following in his personal blogsite: \"Fast forward to right now, 9:58 am, Jan. 9, a lot of what ifs scenarios pop in my head. What if the E-heads members are back, like long-lost blood brothers? What if \"the most significant OPM band of Pinoy Rock\" would be in one room, what would happen?\" And in postscript he adds, \"Para sa akin panahon na para mag-reunite ang E-heads. Sugod na mga kapatid...rock & roll na hanggang umaga.\", which roughly translates, \"For me, it's time for E-Heads to reunite. Let's go brothers...rock & roll until the morning comes.\"\n\nEly's first on-stage public appearance after his heart attack was on Saturday, February 10, 2007 as his band, Pupil, performed at The Music Hall in SM Mall of Asia, in an Animax event called \"Love Is In The Air\". The event featured a speed dating event as a welcome celebration for Valentine's Day and live performances from other local artists such as Callalily, and Amber. Pupil is also part of \"Super Proxy Jam\". It is an event that is hoping to spread awareness for the importance of Cardiovascular Health and for the benefit of The Heartist Foundation Inc. Francis Magalona & The Hardware Syndrome, Parokya Ni Edgar, Gloc-9, Dicta License, PiKaSO, and Dice & Mobbstar are also participants in the said event. Heartist Foundation Inc. is another collaborative effort between Ely Buendia and Francis Magalona that aims to help Filipino artists with health problems.\n\nBuendia joined Marasigan, Adoro, and Zabala for a one-night-only reunion show on August 30, 2008, at The Fort Open Grounds, In Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. The concert, however, was cut short after Ely collapsed due to emotional stress. They were already halfway of a planned 30-song setlist as Ely reportedly collapsed backstage during a break and was rushed to the Makati Medical Center. He was, however, reported to be in stable condition. Buddy had checked on Ely in his tent right after they went to their planned 20 minute break and saw that he already was on an oxygen mask with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics were already taking Ely on an ambulance. Bandmates Buddy, Raimund and Marcus further said that they had no idea that Ely was already having difficulty performing.\n\nResults showed that Buendia suffered from a slight attack and Hypokalemia. The doctors at Philippine Heart Center had found another blocked artery and performed angioplasty right away, which is Ely's third since 2007. On September 5, 2008, Buendia was discharged from the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich was burned during their last concert The final set after the band's last song.\n\n\nBuendia is a supporter of PETA's campaign to free Mali from captivity in the Manila zoo and have her moved to Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary in Thailand.\"I am urging my fans to raise their voices to help free Mali,[She] has been lonely for more than 36 years,\" the 43-year-old musician thinks that \"a sanctuary can give her (Mali) the kind of life that she needs and deserves.\"\n\"If you can't imagine how that feels, just try to remember what you were doing in 1979. That's the last time Mali saw another elephant,\" Ely added. The frontman of \"Pupil\" and \"Oktaves\" hopes that \"people will join me in calling for Mali's transfer to a sanctuary where she can finally be free to act like an elephant and engage in the behavior that comes naturally to her.\"\n\n"}

Where lacis adds decorative stitches to a net ground, Armenian needlelace involves making the net itself decorative.\n\nThere is some archeological evidence suggesting the use of lace in prehistoric Armenia and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs would certainly suggest a pre-Christian root for this art form.\n\nIn contrast to Europe where lace was the preserve of the nobility, in Armenia it decorated everything from traditional headscarves to lingerie and lacemaking was part of many or most women's lives.\n\nThe lace is made by tying knots, usually tied onto the previous round of the piece creating small loops of thread onto which the next round of knots can be tied. Patterns are created by varying the length of the loops, missing loops from the previous round, adding extra loops and similar.\n\nWhen used as an edging the lace can be made directly onto the hem of the fabric being edged. When a doily or freeform object (such as the birds and flowers decorating traditional headscarves) is being started a series of loops is tied onto a slip knot which is pulled tight to complete the first round.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1975626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975626", "title": "Nelson H. Barbour", "text": "Nelson H. Barbour\n\nNelson H. Barbour (August 21, 1824 – August 30, 1905) Barbour was an influential Adventist writer and publisher, best known for his association with and later opposition to Charles Taze Russell.\n\nNelson H. Barbour was born in Throopsville, New York, August 21, 1824, and died in Tacoma, Washington, August 30, 1905.\n\nBarbour was the son of David Barbour and the grandson of Friend Barbour. Both the family and official documents use the spelling \"Barbour\" and its alternative spelling \"Barber\".\n\nHe was related to a number of prominent New Yorkers including Dio Lewis. He attended Temple Hill Academy at Geneseo, New York, from 1839 to 1842. While at Temple Hill he also studied for the Methodist Episcopal ministry with an Elder Ferris, possibly William H. Ferris.\n\nBarbour was introduced to Millerism through the efforts of a Mr. Johnson who lectured at Geneseo, in the winter of 1842. Barbour associated with other Millerites living in that area. These included Owen Crozier, William Marsh, Daniel Cogswell and Henry F. Hill. Cogswell later became president of the New York Conference of the Advent Christian Church. Hill became a prominent author associated with the Evangelical Adventists.\n\nAdventists in the Geneseo area met in Springwater to await the second coming in 1843. Their disappointment was profound, and Barbour suffered a crisis of faith. He later wrote: \"We held together until the autumn of 1844. Then, as if a raft floating in deep water should suddenly disappear from under its living burden, so our platform went from under us, and we made for shore in every direction; but our unity was gone, and, like drowning men, we caught at straws.\"\n\nBarbour pursued a medical career, becoming a medical electrician—a therapist who treated disease through the application of electric current, which was seen as a valid therapy at the time.\n\nHe went to Australia to prospect for gold, returning via London in 1859. Barbour claimed to have preached during his time in Australia. A ship-board discussion with a clergyman reactivated his interest in Bible prophecy. He consulted books on prophetic themes at the British Library and became convinced that 1873 would mark the return of Christ, based on ideas advanced by others since at least as early as 1823.\n\nReturning to the United States, Barbour settled in New York City, continuing his studies in the Astor Library. When fully convinced, he wrote letters and visited those who he felt might best spread his message, though few were interested.\n\nBarbour became an inventor and associated with Peter Cooper, the founder of Cooper Union. He patented several inventions. By 1863 he was in medical practice, dividing his time between Auburn and Rochester, New York. He returned to London in 1864 to demonstrate one of his inventions. He used his association with other inventors and scientists to spread his end-times doctrine, and some of his earliest associates in that belief were inventors and physicians.\n\nHe published something as early as 1868, though it has been lost. In 1871 he wrote and published a small book entitled \"Evidences for the Coming of the Lord in 1873, or The Midnight Cry\", which had two printings. Articles by Barbour also appeared in the Second Adventist press, notably the \"World's Crisis\".\n\nAs 1873 approached, various groups began advocating it as significant. Jonas Wendell led one, another centered on the magazine \"The Watchman's Cry\", and the rest were associated with Barbour. British Barbourites were represented by Elias H. Tuckett, a clergyman. Many gathered at Terry Island to await the return of Christ in late 1873. Barbour and others looked to the next year, which also proved disappointing.\n\nLed by Benjamin Wallace Keith, an associate of Barbour's since 1867, the group adopted the belief in a two-stage, initially invisible presence. They believed that Christ had indeed come in 1874 and would soon become visible for judgments. Barbour started a magazine in the fall of 1873 to promote his views, calling it \"The Midnight Cry\". It was first issued as a pamphlet, with no apparent expectation of becoming a periodical. He quickly changed the name to \"Herald of the Morning\", issuing it monthly from January 1874.\n\nIn December 1875, Charles Taze Russell, then a businessman from Allegheny, received a copy of \"Herald of the Morning\". He met the principals in the Barbourite movement and arranged for Barbour to speak in Philadelphia in 1876. Barbour and Russell began their association, during which Barbour wrote the book \"Three Worlds\" (1877) and published a small booklet by Russell entitled \"Object and Manner of Our Lord's Return\". Beginning in 1878, they each wrote conflicting views on Ransom and Atonement doctrine. By May 3, 1879, Russell wrote that their \"points of variance seem to me to be so fundamental and important that ... I feel that our relationship should cease.\" In a May 22, 1879 letter to Barbour, Russell explicitly resigned: \"Now I leave the 'Herald' with you. I withdraw entirely from it, asking nothing from you ... Please announce in next No. of the 'Herald' the dissolution and withdraw my name [as assistant editor on the masthead].\" In July 1879, Russell began publishing \"Zion's Watch Tower\", the principal journal of the Bible Student movement. (Several years after Russell's death, the magazine became associated with Jehovah's Witnesses and was renamed \"The Watchtower\".)\n\nBy 1883 Barbour abandoned belief in an invisible presence and returned to more standard Adventist doctrine. He had organized a small congregation in Rochester in 1873. At least by that year he left Adventism for Age-to-Come faith, a form of British Literalism. He changed the name of the congregation to Church of the Strangers. In later years the congregation associated with Mark Allen's Church of the Blessed Hope and called themselves Restitutionists. A photo of Nelson Barbour appeared in the Rochester Union and Advertiser in October 1895.\n\nBarbour intermittently published \"Herald of the Morning\" until at least 1903, occasionally issuing statements critical of C. T. Russell. He wrote favorably though cautiously that he was persuaded 1896 was the date for Christ's visible return, an idea that had grown out of the Advent Christian Church. The last date set by Barbour for Christ's return was 1907.\n\nBy the time of his death the Rochester church numbered about fifty, with very minor interest elsewhere. In 1903 Barbour participated in a conference on Mob Spirit in America. He advocated the establishment of a predominately black state in the American south west.\n\nBarbour died while on a trip to the west in 1905 of \"exhaustion\".\n\nAfter his death some of his articles from \"The Herald of the Morning\" were collected and published in book form as \"Washed in His Blood\" (1908).\n\nThe \"Rochester Union and Advertiser\" for October 5, 1895, page 12, offers the following information on Nelson Barbour:\n\nNelson H. Barbour was born at Toupsville, three miles from Auburn, N.Y., in 1824. At an early age the family moved to Cohocton, Stueben County, N. Y. From the age of 15 to 18, he attended school at Temple Hill Academy, Genseco, New York; at which place he united with the Methodist Episcopal Church, and began a preparation for the ministry under elder Ferris. Having been brought up among Presbyterians, however, and having an investigating turn of mind, instead of quietly learning Methodist theology he troubled his teacher with questions of election, universal salvation, and many other subjects, until it was politely hinted that he was more likely to succeed in life as a farmer than as a clergyman. But his convictions were strong that he must preach the gospel even if he could not work in any theological harness. And at 19, he began his life work as an independent preacher. Since which, all that is worth reporting in his life is inseparable from his theological growth. He could not believe in an all wise and loving Father, permitting the fall; then leaving man's eternal destiny to a hap-hazard scramble between a luke-warm Church and a zealous devil. On the contrary he believed the fall was permitted for a wise purpose; and that God has a definite plan for man, in which nothing is left to chance or ignorance.\n\nMr. Barbour believes that what he denominated the present babel of confusion in the churches is the result of false teaching and the literal interpretation of the parables.\n\nThe Church of the Strangers was organized in 1879. Mr. Barbour has preached in England, in several Australian colonies, in Canada, and many states of the Union. For the past twenty-two years he has published the Herald of the Morning in this city; claiming that in his 'call' to preach, he confered not with flesh and blood. Nor was he called to convert the world; but independent of creed, to search for the truth \"as it is in Jesus,\" the \"second man Adam,\" believing that the restored faith is a precurser of the millenium and \"Times of restitution of all things.\"\n\n"}

He co-founded the poetry magazine \"Stars\" in 1956, but was denounced as a \"filial descendant of the landlord class\" when the Anti-Rightist Campaign began in 1957. For the next two decades he performed hard labour and was exiled to the countryside until the end of the Cultural Revolution. He resumed publishing in 1978, and his collection, \"Poems of Liu Shahe\" (1982), won the National Prize for Poetry.\n\nYu Xuntan was born on 11 November 1931 in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Republic of China. His parents were small landowners from Jintang County near Chengdu, and the family moved back to Jintang in 1935. His father worked for the Kuomintang government, and for that reason was killed by the Communist Party during the Land Reform Movement.\n\nHe entered Sichuan University in 1949, majoring in agricultural chemistry. He began writing in 1948, and served as an editor of a supplement to the newspaper \"Western Sichuan Peasant Daily\". He became a professional writer in 1952, and joined the predecessor of the Communist Youth League of China that same year.\n\nIn 1955, Liu published his first poem, which was well received by critics, and became a poet almost exclusively. The following year, he published \"The Country Nocturnes\", his first poetry collection, and was admitted to the Academy of Literature. Together with three other poets, he founded \"Stars\", a monthly poetry magazine, in 1956. He wrote the poem series entitled \"Grass and Stars\" for the inaugural issue of the magazine, but was criticized soon after its publication.\n\nWhen the Anti-Rightist Campaign began in 1957, Liu was denounced as a \"filial descendant of the landlord class\" and forced to undergo reform through labour for the next eight years, working all sorts of jobs including labourer and librarian. During the subsequent Cultural Revolution, he was exiled in Jintang without a job. He continued to compose poems in this period, but most of them were lost.\n\nAfter the end of the Cultural Revolution, Liu resumed publishing in 1978. His collection, \"Poems of Liu Shahe\" (1982), was awarded the National Prize for Poetry. Many of his poems expressed a sense of loss over his youth and sentimentality for the years he spent as a downtrodden labourer. Other poems, written in a serene tone, recorded the emotional solace he found in the difficult times. He wrote less poetry after the mid-1980s, and spent much time publishing and commenting on modern Taiwanese poetry.\n\nLiu was an outspoken critic of the simplification of Chinese characters. He wrote a dedicated column entitled \"Simplified Characters are Unreasonable\" () in the Chinese-language edition of the \"Financial Times\".\n\nSources:\n\nLiu married in 1966. He had a daughter and a son, Yu Kun ().\n\nLiu died in Chengdu on 23 November 2019 from complications of throat cancer, aged 88.\n\n"}

The program is offered free of charge with costs covered by the volunteers. It was launched in 1992 and, by 2016, has flown more than 2 million children in 90 countries. The program's presenting sponsors are Phillips 66 and Sporty's Pilot Shop.\n\nIn 1991, a survey of long-time EAA members was conducted to help determine the organization's future priorities. Nearly 92 percent said EAA's primary objective should be to involve more young people in aviation. The survey also showed that a flight experience inspired respondents toward aviation. On May 13, 1992, following several months of coordination by EAA's then-President Tom Poberezny and members of the EAA Board of Directors, management, staff and volunteers, the Young Eagles Program was unveiled at a Washington, D.C. news conference.\n\nThe mission of the EAA Young Eagles Program is to provide a meaningful flight experience – free of charge – in a general aviation aircraft for young people (primarily between the ages of 8 and 17). Flights are provided by EAA members worldwide.\n\nThe initial goal of the program was to fly one million children prior to the 100th anniversary of flight celebration (Dec. 17, 2003). That goal was achieved on November 13, 2003. An ongoing annual goal of introducing 100,000 young people to the Young Eagles experience has been established.\n\nIn March 2011 EAA reported the results of a study on the program that showed that program participants are 5.4 times more likely to become a pilot than those who never participated and that 9% of those new pilots are female, an increase of 50% compared to the general population of pilots, which is 6% female. The study also indicated that the older a child is when taking their flight that it is the more likely that child will become a pilot, with two out of every 100 participants who are 17 years old continuing to complete a pilot certificate.\nThe program is administered by the Young Eagles Office at EAA headquarters in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\n\nAt AirVenture Oshkosh 2011, EAA unveiled a new program called \"International Young Eagles Day,\" a day set aside to encourage all EAA members and Chapters to participate that is held on the second Saturday of June annually.\n\nAt AirVenture Oshkosh 2012, EAA unveiled a new program called \"Eagle Flights,\" which will offer rides for adults.\n\nIn Canada the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association participated in the Young Eagles program between 1992 and 2008. COPA members have flown more than 81,000 Young Eagles. COPA participation was ended on May 31, 2008 due to insurance concerns.\n\nMore than 43,000 pilots have participated in the program, donating their time and paying the full cost of providing the flights for the children in their own or rented aircraft. While some pilots have only flown a few Young Eagles there are many pilots who have flown more than three thousand children.\n\nAt the program's inception EAA decided to continuously recruit a well-known person and pilot to act as Chairman and raise the profile of the program. The program's founding chairman was Academy Award-winning film actor Cliff Robertson, who served in that capacity from 1992 to 1994. Robertson was succeeded in 1994 by retired USAF General and test pilot Chuck Yeager, the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager stepped down as chairman in 2004 and, in March 2004, franchise film actor Harrison Ford became Chairman of the Young Eagles program. Ford has flown more than 300 Young Eagles, including the 2-millionth Young Eagle, in several types of aircraft, and finished his five-year term in 2009. In September 2009, Captain Chesley Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles, who became famous in the US Airways Flight 1549 Hudson River ditching on 15 January 2009, were named as the program's new co-chairmen.\n\nIn July 2013, aerobatic world champion pilot Sean D. Tucker replaced Sullenberger and Skiles as chairman. In July 2018, NFL tight end Jimmy Graham joined Tucker as the organization's co-chairman.\n\nRolls Royce contributed in 2010 six flight scholarships for basic flight training, and one for advanced training toward a private pilot certificate.\n\nIn May 2009, EAA joined with Sporty's Pilot Shop of Batavia, Ohio, to provide the \"Next Step\" to the Young Eagles Flight experience. Sporty's has made their on line Complete Flight Training Course available to any interested Young Eagle following their flight. Sporty's also provides pilot logbooks to allow Young Eagles to record their flight and any subsequent aviation experiences.\n\nThe Gathering of Eagles is an annual fundraiser auction event to support the Young Eagles program. The organization hosts the event each year in the EAA AirVenture Museum during its EAA AirVenture Airshow. Among items auctioned were a SR-71 themed \"Blackbird\" Ford Mustang donated by Ford Motor Company, Jack Roush, and EAA member Carroll Shelby.\n\nOne-of-a-Kind Auctioned Cars \n\n\n"}

Credited as the first person to imagine distance learning, Handy made his first film in 1910 and presided over a company that produced an estimated 7,000 motion pictures and perhaps as many as 100,000 slidefilms before it was dissolved in 1983. \n\nAs a swimmer, Handy introduced a number of new swimming strokes to Americans, such as the Australian crawl. He would often wake up early and devise new strokes to give him an edge over other swimmers. Swimming led to him getting a bronze in the 1904 Olympics at St. Louis, Missouri. Twenty years later he was part of the Illinois Athletic Club water polo team at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France. He broke the record of longest period of time between first and last competition. The team won the bronze at that Olympics. Handy swam almost every day until the last few months of his life.\n\nHandy appeared swimming in a commercial from 1978 asking for the public to support American athletes training for the 1980 Olympic games before the boycott. At the time of his filming, he was the oldest living United States Olympic medalist.\n\nHandy attended North Division High School (now Lincoln Park High School) in Chicago, and then the University of Michigan during the 1902–03 academic year. During that time he was working as a campus correspondent for the \"Chicago Tribune\" when on May 8 he wrote an article about a lecture in the Elocution 2 class given by Prof. Thomas C. Trueblood as a \"course in lovemaking.\" Handy went on to describe how Trueblood had dropped to a bended knee in order to demonstrate how to make an effective marriage proposal. John T. McCutcheon, a \"Chicago Record Herald\" cartoonist, followed the next day with a cartoon about a \"Professor Foxy Truesport\" showing his class how to best make love.\n\nNeither Trueblood nor university President James B. Angell were amused. Ten days after the initial article was published, Handy was suspended for a year for \"publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors.\" Handy was told he could re-apply one year later. Instead, Handy decided to apply to a different school, but he was unable to gain acceptance to other schools because of what had happened at the University of Michigan. Handy was accepted to the University of Pennsylvania but was told to leave after two weeks of classes.\n\n\"Tribune\" editor Medill McCormick tried to intervene on Handy's behalf, but Angell refused to change the suspension. At that point, McCormick offered Handy a job. Handy worked in a number of departments at the \"Tribune\". It was during his time working on the advertising staff that Handy observed that informing and building up salespeople's enthusiasm for the products they were selling helped to move more merchandise. He also began researching exactly what made people buy a particular product.\n\nHandy left the \"Tribune\" to do further work on corporate communications. He worked with John H. Patterson of National Cash Register, who had used slides to help train workers. With help from another associate, Handy began making and distributing films that showed consumers how to operate everyday products. After World War I broke out, Handy began making films to show how to operate military equipment. During this time the Jam Handy Organization was formed.\n\nHandy was married to Helen Hoag Rogers and had five children. One of his daughter Chaille's children is the printmaker Garner Tullis. Another of his daughter Chaille's children is the inventor Barclay J. Tullis.\n\nAfter World War I, the Jam Handy Organization was contracted as the Chicago-Detroit branch of Bray Productions, creating films for the auto industry, Bray's largest private client.\n\nGeneral Motors selected Handy's organization to produce short training films as well as other training and promotional materials. One such film was 1940's \"Hired!\" – a training film for sales managers at Chevrolet dealerships. This film was eventually featured as two parts on the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" episodes \"Bride of the Monster\" and \"\". The MST3K team also spoofed other Handy film shorts, including \"A Case of Spring Fever\" (1940) during the \"Squirm\" episode, one of the final shows of the original MST3K series. Many films produced by the Jam Handy Organization were collected by Prelinger Archives and may be seen and downloaded at the Internet Archive. \n\n\"Master Hands\", the legendary 1936 documentary sponsored film (or as was called a \"capitalist realist drama\"), was selected by the National Film Registry for preservation in 1999. \n\nBetween 1936 and 1938, the Jam Handy Organization made a series of six animated fantasy sales films for Chevrolet featuring a gnome named Nicky Nome, which showed new Chevrolet automobiles saving the day from villains, often in retellings of classic tales such as Cinderella, the subject of two of those films, \"A Coach for Cinderella\" and \"A Ride for Cinderella\". The other films were \"Nicky Rides Again\", \"Peg-Leg Pedro\", \"The Princess and the Pauper\", and \"One Bad Knight\".\n\nThe Jam Handy Organization produced the first animated version of the new Christmas story \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" (1948), sponsored by retailer Montgomery Ward and directed by Max Fleischer. \n\nHandy also produced films for other companies and for schools. He's estimated to have produced over 7,000 films for the armed services during World War II. Handy was noted for taking only a one-percent profit on the films, while he could have taken as much as seven percent. He was noted for never having a desk at work, instead of using any available workspace. Handy's suits didn't have pockets, as he thought they were a waste of time.\n\nDespite Handy's troubles with the University of Michigan, his son-in-law Max Mallon, granddaughter Susan Webb, and great-granddaughter Kathryn Tullis received degrees from the school. Handy would receive an honorary doctorate from Eastern Michigan University. He also continued swimming on a regular basis until just a few days before his death.\n\nHandy's personal papers and the surviving Jam Handy Organization records are housed at the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library. His family and ancestry are featured in a historical collection held at the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan. The Clements Library also published a book titled \"Annals and Memorials of the Handys and Their Kindred\" by Isaac W.K. Handy, edited by Mildred Handy Ritchie and Sarah Rozelle Handy Mallon (Ann Arbor, 1992). An hour-long interview with Jamison Handy (published December 26, 1961) is available at Internet Archive.\n\n\n"}

Gregorio Gómez and the Mexican Centralist garrison engaged Gen. José Antonio Mexía and 150 American volunteers. This was part of an uprising against General Santa Anna, and its outcome affected the future of the Texas War of Independence.\n\nAfter the Mexican Congress elected General Santa Anna as President of Mexico in 1833, he appointed Valentín Gómez Farías as his vice president and turned over much of the governing of Mexico to him. However, the Vice President began implementing liberal reforms, particularly impacting the Mexican Army and the Catholic Church. These reforms angered the powerful conservative forces, who urged Santa Anna to abandon his semi-retirement. Santa Anna agreed and led the reaction against liberalization, forcing Gómez Farías and his Federalist supporters to flee into exile in the United States.\nWhen the revolt began in October 1835, a majority of the Texas colonists remained loyal to Mexico. \"The Consultation\", a meeting at San Felipe de Austin on November 7, 1835 resulted in a statement that the colonists were defending the republican principles of the Mexican Constitution of 1824. This statement emboldened Santa Anna's exiled opponents in the United States. Mexican General José Antonio Mexía and several other political opponents of Santa Anna's opponents fled to New Orleans, USA where they planned to resist the Centralist government. Mexia declared that capturing Tampico, Mexico would be a fatal stroke against that government.\n\nIn October 1835, Mexía raised a military force in New Orleans for the purpose of supporting Federalist opposition thought to be present in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. On October 29, Mexia reported to Texian leaders that he had commissioned the armed schooner \"Mary Jane\", to transport his expedition with a 12-pound cannonade and two eight-pound cannon. He added that there was a crew of fifty men, armed and provisioned for three months, plus 150 men ready for service on land. A subsequent report stated that the expedition contained a company of grenadiers with 52 men, a 42-man company of sharpshooters, 33 French and Creole volunteers known as the Company of Liberty and a marine corps consisting of 15 men. The latter included a captain, eight seamen, a first mate, a second mate, two cooks and two stewards.\n\nThe expedition departed from New Orleans on November 6, 1835. Richard Hall, master of the schooner \"Mary Jane\" had declared his destination to be Galveston and Matagorda. The cargo was reported as \"...10 barrels of flour, 20 barrels of beef, 10 barrels of pork,6 barrels and 20 boxes of fish, 8 boxes of hardware and 20 boxes of potatoes.\" Five days after her departure, the ship encountered a storm that allegedly blew it off course. Only then did Mexia's staff tell the volunteers aboard the ship that the \"Mary Jane\" was bound for Tampico, not for Texas. It arrived at the bar off Tampico, at the mouth of the Panuco River, on November 14, When the pilot arrived to guide the ship into port, Mexia discovered that no one had told him about the ship's pending arrival. Before the ship passed the bar, a storm blew in and caused the vessel to run aground. The ship began taking on water, so Mexia ordered his men to throw some of the artillery and other supplies overboard, believing that lightening the load would free the ship.\n\nCaptain John M. Allen and Hall went ashore with six sailors to contact the fort that protected the port. The twenty-four man garrison not only quickly surrendered the fort and its three 24-pound cannon to Mexia's forces, they switched sides and joined the expedition.\n\nMexia and 150 supporters waded ashore and spent some time drying out. On November 15, they attempted to capture that important port city. The bulk of the Tampico garrison, commanded by Gregorio Gomez Palomino, had remained loyal to the centralist government. Federalist supporters had already been crushed by the Centralists. They knew of Mexia's landing and fortified the Tampico customs house. They had also been reinforced by a company of the Tuxpan Battalion. Federalist supporters had already been crushed by the Centralists and the attack failed. The federalist troops made their way into Tampico and arrived at the customs house. Shooting began when a sentinel outside discovered the invaders. The garrison began firing with cannon, killing two of Mexia's men. The invaders rushed the cannon and killed three of the defenders. The battle lasted about two hours. Mexia's men captured the customs house and two pieces of artillery, forcing the defenders to retreat into a nearby fort. By then, most of the invaders' usable ammunition had been expended. Mexia then ordered a retreat.\n\nMexia and his supporters boarded an American schooner, the \"Halcyon\", which took them to the mouth of the Brazos River.\n\nThirty-one of the men who had arrived on the \"Mary Jane\" were taken prisoner. Three died of wounds and the remaining twenty-eight were executed on December 14, 1835.\n\nMexía's defeat convinced many Texians that Mexico's Federalists would be no help, thereby causing hard feelings to arise between these potential allies. Furthermore, the Mexican government declared that the expedition had been carried out by \"pirates,\" executing the men Mexía left behind. This policy of \"no quarter\" was extended to the Texas situation in the pronouncement of the Tornel Decree.\n"}

{"id": "1975701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975701", "title": "Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism", "text": "Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism\n\nCeltic Reconstructionist Paganism (also Celtic Reconstructionism or CR) is a polytheistic reconstructionist approach to Celtic neopaganism, emphasising historical accuracy over eclecticism such as is found in many forms of Neo-druidism. It is an effort to reconstruct and revive, in a modern Celtic cultural context, pre-Christian Celtic religions.\n\nCeltic Reconstructionist Paganism originated in discussions among amateur scholars and Neopagans in the mid-1980s, and evolved into an independent tradition by the early 1990s.\nCurrently, \"Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism\" (CR) is an umbrella term, with a number of recognized sub-traditions or denominations.\n\nAs modern paganism grew in scope and cultural visibility, some Euro-Americans saw the pre-Christian religions of their ancestors as being worthy of revival, and the study of mythology and folklore as a way to accomplish this. While most Neodruid groups of the period were primarily interested in \"revitalizing the spirit of what they believe was the religious practice of pre-Roman Britain\", the Celtic Reconstructionists (CRs) focused on only \"reconstructing what can be known from the extant historical record.\"\n\nMany of the people who eventually established CR were involved in modern pagan groups in the 1970s and 1980s. Much dialogue in the 1980s took place at workshops and discussions at pagan festivals and gatherings, as well as in the pages of pagan publications. This period, and these groups, are referred to in retrospect as \"Proto-CR\". Later, with the establishment of the Internet in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many of these groups and individuals came together online. This began a period of increased communication, and led to the growth of the movement.\n\nThe first appearance in print of the term \"Celtic Reconstructionist\", used to describe a specific religious movement and not just a style of Celtic studies, was by Kym Lambert ní Dhoireann in the Spring, 1992 issue of Harvest Magazine. Ní Dhoireann credits Kathryn Price NicDhàna with originating the term “Celtic Reconstructionist”; however, NicDhàna credits her early use of the term to a simple extrapolation of Margot Adler's use of the term \"Pagan reconstructionists\" in the original, 1979 edition of \"\". Though Adler devotes space to a handful of Reconstructionist traditions, none of those mentioned are specifically Celtic. In chapter eleven, while describing his Neo-druidic group, New Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA), Isaac Bonewits uses the phrase \"Eclectic Reconstructionist.\" Eventually, this pairing of terms became oxymoronic; in the pagan/polytheist communities, \"reconstructionist\" had now come to mean traditions that specifically exclude eclecticism.\n\nWith the growth of the Internet during the 1990s, hundreds of individuals and groups gradually joined the discussions online and in print, and the movement became more of an umbrella group, with a number of recognized sub-traditions.\n\nWhile the ancient Celtic religions were largely subsumed by Christianity, many religious traditions have survived in the form of folklore, mythology, songs, and prayers. Many folkloric practices never completely died out, and some Celtic Reconstructionists (CRs) claim to have survivals of Irish, Scottish or Welsh folkloric customs in their families of origin.\n\nLanguage study and preservation, and participation in other cultural activities such as Celtic music, dance and martial arts forms, are seen as a core part of the tradition. Participation in the living Celtic cultures – the cultures that exist in the \"areas in which Celtic languages are actually spoken and in which Celtic traditions have been most faithfully handed down to the present day\" – is a vital part of their cultural work and spiritual practice. The protection of Celtic archaeological and sacred sites is important to Celtic Reconstructionists. When construction of the N3 motorway in Ireland threatened to destroy archaeological sites around the Hill of Tara, Celtic Reconstructionists (among others) organized protests and a coordinated ritual of protection.\n\nLike many other modern pagan traditions, Celtic Reconstructionism has no sacred texts and so personal research is stressed. In order to more fully reconstruct pre-Christian Celtic religions, many CRs study archaeology, historical manuscripts, and comparative religion, primarily of Celtic cultures, but sometimes other European cultures, as well. Celtic Reconstructionists are not pan-Celtic in practice, but rather immerse themselves in a particular Celtic culture, such as Gaelic, Welsh or Gaulish. According to Kathryn Price NicDhàna, CRs believe that while it is helpful to study a wide variety of Celtic cultures as an aid to religious reconstruction, and to have a broad understanding of religion in general, in practice these cultures are not lumped together. In addition to cultural preservation and scholarly research Celtic Reconstructionists believe that mystical, ecstatic practices are a necessary balance to scholarship, and that this balance is a vital component of any Celtic Reconstructionist tradition.\n\nWhile CRs strive to revive the religious practices of historical Celtic peoples as accurately as possible, they acknowledge that some aspects of their religious practice are reconstructions. Celtic Reconstructionists state that their practices are based on cultural survivals, augmented with the study of early Celtic beliefs found in texts and the work of scholars and archaeologists. Feedback from scholars and experienced practitioners is sought before a new practice is accepted as a valid part of a reconstructed tradition.\n\nCeltic Reconstructionists believe it is important to lay aside elements of ancient Celtic cultures which they consider inappropriate practices in a modern society. CRs attempt to find ethical ways of integrating historical findings and research with the activities of daily life. Many CRs view each act of daily life as a form of ritual, accompanying daily acts of purification and protection with traditional prayers and songs from sources such as the Scottish Gaelic \"Carmina Gadelica\" or manuscript collections of ancient Irish or Welsh poetry. Celebratory, community rituals are usually based on community festivals as recorded in folklore collections by authors such as F. Marian McNeill, Kevin Danaher or John Gregorson Campbell. These celebrations often involve bonfires, dances, songs, divination and children's games. More formal or mystical rituals are often based on traditional techniques of interacting with the Otherworld, such as the act of making offerings of food, drink and art to the spirits of the land, ancestral spirits, and the Celtic deities. CRs give offerings to the spirits throughout the year, but at Samhain, more elaborate offerings are made to specific deities and ancestors.\n\nThe ancient Irish swore their oaths by the \"Three Realms\" – Land, Sea, and Sky. Based on this precedent, reconstructed Gaelic ritual structures acknowledge the Land, Sea and Sky, with the fire of inspiration as a central force that unites the realms. Many Celtic Reconstructionists maintain altars and shrines to their patron spirits and deities, often choosing to place them at outdoor, natural locations such as wells, streams, and special trees. Some CRs practice divination; ogham is a favored method, as are folkloric customs such as the taking of omens from the shapes of clouds or the behavior of birds and animals.\n\nNicDhàna and ní Dhoireann have stated that they coined the term \"Celtic Reconstructionist / Celtic Reconstructionism (CR)\" specifically to distinguish their practices and beliefs from those of eclectic traditions like Wicca and Neo-druidism. With ní Dhoireann's popularization of Celtic Reconstructionism in the neopagan press and then the use of the term by these individuals and others on the Internet, “Celtic Reconstructionism” began to be adopted as the name for this developing spiritual tradition.\n\nSome groups that take a Celtic Reconstructionist approach to ancient Gaelic polytheism call themselves \"Gaelic Traditionalists\". Preservation of the living traditions in modern Gaelic (and other modern Celtic) communities has always been a priority in Celtic Reconstructionism. However, according to \"The CR FAQ\" there has been some controversy around the use of the term \"Gaelic Traditionalists\" by groups outside of the Gaeltacht and Gàidhealtachd areas of Ireland, Scotland and Nova Scotia. In the opinion of Isaac Bonewits this is partly because \"Gaelic Traditionalists\" is a term used almost exclusively by Celtic Christians. As Kym Lambert ní Dhoireann put it, \"Gaelic Traditionalists\" means \"those living and raised in the living cultures and [who] are keeping their culture, language and music alive, not any of the American polytheistic groups that have been using it lately.\" \"The CR FAQ\" states that due to those in the Gaelic-speaking areas having a prior claim to the term, most Reconstructionists have been uncomfortable with the choice of other Reconstructionists to call themselves \"Traditionalists\", a sentiment which Bonewits echoes. According to the authors of \"The CR FAQ\", while the disagreement over terminology has at times led to heated discussion, the polytheistic “traditionalists” and “reconstructionists” are taking the same approach to their religion, and there are generally good relations between the founders of both movements.\n\nWhile Celtic Reconstructionism was the earliest term in use and still remains the most widespread, as the movement progressed other names for a Celtic Reconstructionist approach were also popularized, with varying degrees of success. Some CR groups have looked to the individual Celtic languages for a more culturally specific name for the tradition, or for their branch of the tradition.\n\nSome Gaelic-oriented groups have used the Scottish Gaelic, ' ('Paganism, Heathenism') or the Irish version, '. One Gaelic Polytheist group on the East Coast of the US has used a modification of the Gaelic term as \"\" ('Paganism of Goddesses').\n\nIn 2000, IMBAS, A Celtic Reconstructionist organisation based in Seattle active during the late 1990s to early 2000s, adopted the name \"Senistrognata\", a constructed \"Old Celtic\" term intended as translating to \"ancestral customs\". is an Old Irish word meaning 'poetic inspiration'. The organization \"promotes the spiritual path of Senistrognata, the ancestral customs of the Celtic peoples. It is a path open to Pagans, Christians, and Ag[n]ostics alike.\"\n\n\nThough there has been cross-pollination between Neo-druid and Celtic Reconstructionist groups, and there is significant crossover of membership between the two movements, the two have largely differing goals and methodologies in their approach to Celtic religious forms. Reconstructionists tend to place high priority on historical authenticity and traditional practice. Some Neo-druids tend to prefer a modern Pagan, eclectic approach, focusing on \"the spirit of what they believe was the religious practice of pre-Roman Britain\".\n\nHowever, some Neo-druid groups (notably, (ADF), the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids (OBOD), and the Henge of Keltria) adopted similar methodologies of reconstruction, at least some of the time. ADF, in particular, has long used reconstructionist techniques, but the group has been criticized for their pan-Indo-European scope, which may result in non-Celtic combinations such as \"Vedic druids\" and \"Roman druids\".\n\nTerminological differences exist as well, especially in terms of what \"druid\" means. Some Neo-druid groups call anyone with an interest in Celtic spirituality a \"druid\", and refer to the practice of any Celtic-inspired spirituality as \"druidry\", while reconstructionist groups usually use the older definition, seeing \"druid\" as a culturally-specific office that requires decades of training and experience, which is only attained by a small number of practitioners, and which must be conferred and confirmed by the community the druid serves.\n\n\nFestivals\n\n\nCeltic Reconstructionists rely on primary mythological texts, as well as surviving folklore, for the basis of their religious practices. No list can completely cover all the recommended works, but this is a small sample of sources used.\n\nGeneral Celtic\n\n\nGaelic (Irish and Scottish)\n\n\nComparative European\n\n\n"}

The first Copperhead was Lawrence Chesney, who made his debut in \"Daredevil\" #124 (Aug 1975) and was created by writers Len Wein and Marv Wolfman, and artist Gene Colan. The second Copperhead, Arthur Reynolds, was a coworker of Chesney and stole his costume after Chesney was killed. Reynolds first appeared in \"Human Fly #8\" (Apr 1978) by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Frank Robbins. The third person to use the name Copperhead is totally unrelated to the first two characters, Davis Lawfers, who took the name from the snake of the same name. Lawfers first appeared in \"Captain America\" #337 (1988) created by writers Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio and artist Tom Morgan.\n\nChesney's mental illness caused him to think he was Copperhead, a pulp fiction hero he grew up reading. Chesney would leave copper pennies on the eyes of his murder victims. When he began to target the writer and publisher of the original Copperhead stories he was stopped by Daredevil. During the fight Chesney was struck by lightning and killed. Reynolds worked with Chesney as a museum guard and later discovered Chesney's secret identity. Using the costume he planned to rob the museum where he worked as a guard, but was stopped by White Tiger and the Human Fly.\n\nThe third Copperhead, was originally a henchman of Viper, given a suit with built in powers based on the Copperhead. Teamed up with Fer-de-lance, Black Racer, and Puff Adder they formed the Serpent Squad, a ploy to get them accepted into the Serpent Society. The group is accepted by Sidewinder and the Serpent Society, enabling them to help push Sidewider out of power, allowing Viper to take control of the group. When Viper is deposed later on Copperhead leaves the Serpent Society. He later returned to the Serpent Society and became part of Serpent Solutions when the group was reorganized in 2015.\n\nThe Lawrence Chesney version of Copperhead first appeared in \"Daredevil\" #124-125 (August–September 1975), and was created by Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, and Gene Colan. The character subsequently appears in \"Human Fly\" #9 (May 1978), \"Daredevil\" #1/2 (1998), and \"Daredevil/Spider-Man\" #1-4 (January–April 2001). Copperhead received an entry in the \"All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\" #3 (2006).\n\nThe second Copperhead appeared in \"Human Fly\" #8-9 (Apr-May 1978), and was created by Bill Mantlo and Frank Robbins.\n\nThe third Copperhead appeared in \"Captain America\" #337 (1988), and was created by Mark Gruenwald, Ralph Macchio and Tom Morgan\n\nLawrence Chesney grew up hearing the tales of a pulp fiction hero named Copperhead from his father, who was the model for the covers of the Copperhead pulps and came to believe he himself \"was\" Copperhead. Chesney, warped by his father's madness, assumes the Copperhead guise, and leaves his calling card of copper pennies on the eyes of his victims. His murders of the writer and the publisher of the Copperhead pulps brings him the attention of Daredevil. As he fights Daredevil, Copperhead is struck by lightning and killed by electrocution.\n\nAfter death, Copperhead becomes the agent of a demon. He is sent back to Earth to retrieve Spider-Man’s soul, but fails after battling Spider-Man and Daredevil.\n\nArthur Reynolds discovered that his former co-worker at the museum, Lawrence Chesney, had been Copperhead, and had been killed. Reynolds broke into Chesney's apartment and stole a spare Copperhead costume, assuming the identity. His plan to rob the museum were defeated by White Tiger and the Human Fly.\nDavis Lawfers was born in Rochester, New York. He was a civil servant before becoming an agent of the Viper and a professional criminal. Copperhead was the leader of the fourth Serpent Squad, consisting also of Fer-de-lance, Black Racer, and Puff Adder. The quartet robbed a Las Vegas casino and battled Captain America, Falcon, Nomad, and D-Man in order to attract the attention of Sidewinder, then the leader of the Serpent Society. The Serpent Squad was freed from jail by the Sidewinder, and were inducted into the Serpent Society. In truth, they were sent by the Viper so she could infiltrate the organization and take over as its new leader. After the coup was staged, Copperhead was assigned by the Viper, along with the Cobra and Boomslang to put a mutagenic agent into the water supply of Washington D.C. During that mission, he and Cobra had personality conflicts and did not get along, and battled Captain America and Diamondback. After the Viper's plot was foiled, the Society re-organized with Cobra as the new leader. Copperhead did not stay long and quietly disappeared from the ranks of the Society.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, Lawfers rejoined the Society. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the American Midwest claiming they were protecting themselves from the Skrulls. However, they were easily defeated by Nova and his new Nova Corps.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event, Copperhead appears as a member of Viper's Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions. He assisted Black Racer and Cottonmouth into attacking Captain America and Diamondback where Captain America learned too late that Diamondback is in league with the Serpent Solutions where she knocks him out and they bring him to Serpent Solutions' headquarters. They were later defeated by Captain America and his friends.\n\nCopperhead has no superhuman powers. He has moderate experience in hand-to-hand combat and street fighting techniques, but mainly relies on his weaponry.\n\nHe wears finger-shooters on his gauntlets which project electrical discharges (\"poison-blasts\"); a spring-loaded, telescoping, rapid-retracting, wrist-mounted, titanium steel alloy grappling hook (\"shooting fang\"), with cable line; exploding magnesium flare-bombs stored in his snake-head helmet compartment (\"copper-bursts\"); micro-suction cups in gloves and boots, enabling adhesion to walls and ceilings. His equipment was designed by technicians hired by the Viper. His gauntlets need to be recharged regularly using the spare poison-blast cartridges in his belt.\n\nFor protection, Copperhead wears a copper suit of scale mail, which functions as light body armor made of micro-mesh chain-mail covered with reinforced synthetic chain-mail tunic.\n\n"}

In the first half of the 20th century, it was famous for its burlesque houses. It was a noted starting point and stop-over for many noted burlesque dancers, including the likes of Blaze Starr.\n\nBy the 1950s, the clubs became seedier, as burlesque was replaced by strip clubs and sex shops. The Block of that era is featured prominently in several films, notably Barry Levinson's \"Liberty Heights\" and \"Diner\", as well as Steve Yeager's independent feature drama \"On The Block\", with Howard Rollins.\n\nThe decades to follow would bring a marked increase in general crime, prostitution, and drug dealing, an unusual situation considering the location of Baltimore's Police Headquarters and Central Police District House at the east end of the block.

{"id": "1975721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975721", "title": "Meyer locomotive", "text": "Meyer locomotive\n\nA Meyer locomotive is a type of articulated locomotive. The design was never as popular as the Garratt or Mallet locomotives. It can be best regarded as 19th Century competition for the early compound Mallet and also the Fairlie articulated designs.\n\nThe Meyer was the brainchild of Frenchman Jean-Jacques Meyer (1804-1877), who took out a patent on the design in 1861. The first locomotive, an named \"L'Avenir\" (Future), was built by in 1868 with the support of a state subsidy.\n\nNo wheels are rigidly affixed to the boiler; all are mounted on bogies placed directly under the boiler/cab unit (comparable with a modern diesel or electric locomotive). This compares with a Mallet, where the rear set of wheels are attached to the frame, and only the front set swivels as a bogie. Therefore, boiler overhang is less than that of the Mallet locomotive on a curve of the same radius. Meyers are usually set up as a tank engine, with the boiler/cab unit carrying the water and fuel supplies.\n\nA disadvantage of the design is that the firebox is directly above the rear power unit, which limits its size. With two power bogies, flexible steam pipes must be provided to all cylinders. This was difficult to achieve with 19th Century technology. Early Mallet locomotives had compound cylinders, so high pressure steam was provided to the rigid power unit, while the front cylinders (requiring flexible steam pipes) received low pressure steam.\n\nMeyer locomotives were most common in continental Europe, particularly Germany. A number of Meyer locos can still be found on the narrow gauge railways in Saxony. The most common locomotive is the Saxon IV K.\n\nThe Switzerland Bernina Railway had two rotary snowplows built by Schweizerische Lokomotiv- und Maschinenfabrik in 1910 and 1912. To work on the tight curves of the meter gauge mountain railway they had to be selfpropelled, the two snow blowers were thus built with a Meyer drive system. Both have been preserved, X 9213 is still in working condition on the Rhaetian Railway, based in Pontresina, as of 2010.\n\nThe Kitson Meyer is most closely associated with Kitson & Co. of Leeds, but was also built by other locomotive builders. The design originated from an idea by Robert Stirling, Locomotive Superintendent of the Anglo-Chilian Nitrate & Railway Company. After placing an order with Kitsons for some conventional locos, he approached them with his ideas for an articulated loco. Kitsons further developed the idea, the first loco being constructed in 1894.\n\nThe Meyer design was modified by moving the rear power unit further back and allowed the firebox to be between the two power units (as in a Garratt), thus allowing a larger firebox. The length of engine was increased, with the extra length behind the cab being used for additional water tanks. Some designs had an auxiliary chimney at the rear to avoid the need for an exhaust steam pipe running the length of the engine.\n\nKitson Meyers were widely used in South America, particularly on the Colombian and Chilean railways. It was regarded as the best performing of all articulated designs for railway lines that constantly curved. However fewer than 100 Kitson Meyers were ever built, and it was generally thought that the design suffered from competition with the Garratt.\nOne Kitson-Meyer locomotive known to survive sits in a rather poor state of preservation in Taltal, an old nitrate port town in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. It is parked in front of two old passenger coaches from the nitrate railway at coordinates . Three Kitson Meyers of the Transandine Railways also have survived, one in Argentina (Tafi Viejo; as of 2013 in derelict condition) and two in Chile (#3348 at Los Andes station workshop, seen under restoration on 8-Sep-2013 and Serial #4664 Operating #3349 at the Museo Ferroviario de Santiago, Parque Quinta Normal, Santiago de Chile, in cosmetically restored condition). There are also six very derelict locos in the \"Locomotive Graveyard\" at Uyuni, Bolivia (October 2013).\n\nA number of large narrow gauge industrial locomotives were built in the U.K. by W. G.

He served as secretary of the Legation of Mexico in Washington from about 1829 to 1831.\n\nHe was born about 1800 to Pedro Mexía and his wife Juana Josefa Hernández, but his birthplace is debated. According to Mexía himself, his birthplace was Xalapa, Veracruz. Some historians cite records that put his place of birth as Cuba. Although details of his early life are scant, he lost his father and brother sometime in the Mexican War of Independence and fled to the United States where he became fluent in the English language. \n\nBy 1822, Mexía was back living in Mexico and working as an official interpreter for the Cherokee Nation, by appointment of Coahuila y Tejas president José Félix Trespalacios. Mexía became active in government service as Secretary of State for Tamaulipas and the Tuxpan customs collector. He spent two years as the grand secretary of the York Rite masons Grand Lodge of Mexico, an organization which some in Mexico viewed as having political undertones. Enlisting in the military, he quickly rose to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nMexía was originally a supporter of Antonio López de Santa Anna, who was elected President of Mexico on a Federalist platform. During Mexía's 1832 expedition, he traveled to Texas to quell the rebellion started by the Anahuac Disturbances. As a senator for the state of México, he participated in an 1834 uprising against President Santa Anna, who had changed his politics to centralism. Two months later, he was captured by centralist forces in Jalisco and sent into exile.\n\nHe traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he encouraged American filibusters to invade Mexico, recruiting Anglo settlers under the guise of brokering land for them. On November 6, 1835, the schooner \"Mary Jane\" set sail for Tampico, Tamaulipas, in the Tampico Expedition. The Americans, realizing they had been tricked, did not support Mexía's plan of inciting another uprising against Santa Anna. Thirty-one men were taken as prisoners, but Mexía managed to escape to Texas. Santa Anna ordered the execution of the prisoners. Three died from illness.\n\nIn 1839, Mexía joined General José de Urrea's rebellion against Santa Anna and was defeated and captured at the Battle of Acajete. For his participation in the rebellion. Mexía was executed by firing squad on May 3, 1839.\n\nThe town of Mexia, Texas, in Limestone County is part of multiple large land tracts granted to the Mexía family in 1833 by the government of Coahuila y Tejas. When the town was laid out in the 1870s, it was given the Mexía family name.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1975748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975748", "title": "Academic dress of the University of Bristol", "text": "Academic dress of the University of Bristol\n\nThe academic dress prescribed by the University of Bristol is a mixture of that prescribed by Cambridge and Oxford. Bristol has chosen, for graduates, to mainly specify Oxford-style gowns and Cambridge-style hoods. Unlike many British universities, the hood itself is to be \"University red\", lined with a specified colour. University red is defined to be Pantone 187. Bristol also specifies that undergraduates are to wear gowns \"of the approved pattern\" in certain circumstances, although the pattern itself is not specified. This is not too important since, in practice, undergraduates are never required to be gowned except when graduating.\n\nAs at most universities, when graduating, graduands wear the dress appropriate to the degree to which they are to be admitted. This appears to be a \"de facto\" rather than legislated practice since there is no specific provision in Statute, Ordinance or Regulation for how graduands should dress. Regulations prescribing academic dress refer specifically to \"graduate members of the University\" and thus exclude those who are in the process of graduating but have not yet graduated. This is a pedantic point, but in at least two British universities (Cambridge and Oxford), the rules are the other way around for this very reason (i.e. graduands wear their \"current\" degree, or undergraduate dress if they are not a graduate, with the hood of the new degree).\n\nBristol specifies four main types of dress: bachelor's, master's, doctor's undress and doctor's full dress. Within these groups, the dress is identical save for a few specific exceptions. Although academic caps are specified, by tradition they are never worn by graduands, except for honorary graduands. Bristol graduates taking part in Bristol graduation ceremonies as staff can and do wear the prescribed headgear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the University does not refer to M.D., D.D.S. or Eng.D. as higher doctorates they are not included in the list that wears the gowns clearly intended for junior doctorates (those with violet). It is thus appropriate for them to use salmon facings and hood-linings leaving the PhD and Ed.D. as somewhat anomalous exceptions. In practice, M.D., D.D.S. and Eng.D. are not awarded very often and the other, higher, doctorates are reserved largely for honorary degrees so the anomaly is minor.\n\n\nAll Officers wear academic caps of the customary pattern covered with black velvet; the Chancellor's cap being distinguished by a gold tassel and gold braid binding, and the Vice-Chancellor's by gold braid binding.\n\nStudents gaining Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Bristol (apart from honorary graduates) do not wear mortarboards at graduation. According to an unverified legend, this is because at an early graduation ceremony the male graduands all threw their headgear either at the female graduands, or off the Clifton Suspension Bridge, by way of 'protest' at coeducation. Subsequently, mortarboards were not worn. This legend is told of a number of other universities and is almost certainly untrue, particularly given that University College Bristol was coeducational before the University proper even existed and that the Clifton suspension bridge is about 1.5 miles away (2.4 km).\n\n"}

It is also the artist name under which the album was released. Its first two singles, \"That's All, That's All\" (in the U.S.) and \"Wilted Rose\" (in Canada), were released in early May 2005; only the latter song had a music video, which was animated.\n\nThe album features songs written mostly with longtime collaborator, Stephen Duffy (one track—\"So. Cal\"—was written solo). Some of the songs are older holdovers (\"That's All, That's All\" was a song cut from the 2000 BNL album \"Maroon\"). Other songs were written later specifically for the project. The album was released on June 21, 2005.\n\nThe lead vocals on the album were all provided by Page. Page also provided much of the album's instrumentation both through playing of instruments, and through programming computer-generated instruments. Duffy also played instruments on the record, as did several other guest performers.\n\nSteven Page began collaborating with songwriter Stephen Duffy in the early 1990s, and their first co-written tracks appeared on the Barenaked Ladies' second release, \"Maybe You Should Drive\". The two co-wrote a number of songs over the years, including several on each of the band's next two albums. On their fifth album \"Maroon\", only one Duffy co-write was included (at least two others were cut). Starting with the following album, the band decided that it would be best to keep the writing duties amongst the band members. Page started The Vanity Project to allow himself to write with other writers outside of Barenaked Ladies, as well as to express some writing ideas that did not work within the band.\n\nPage continued writing with Duffy and directed those songs, as well as song unused prior songs to his solo effort. The project's name resulted from a tape made for the project which was jokingly labeled \"Vanity Project\". The title was subsequently adopted seriously for the project. Page indicated, at the time of its release, a potential for subsequent albums in collaboration with other writers and artists, but as of his 2009 departure from Barenaked Ladies, there had been no indication of any work on a follow-up.\n\nFollowing its release, Page toured on his own in support of the album, performing the songs acoustically on guitar, mainly in music and book stores around the United States. He played both songs from \"The Vanity Project\", and Barenaked Ladies songs. Since these promotional shows, there has been no subsequent reference by Page to his solo act as The Vanity Project, though he has played songs from the album at these shows.\n\nIn January 2007, Page put together a band for the Barenaked Ladies Ships and Dip Cruise to perform a concert of \"The Vanity Project\" music with him. The Vanity Projects, as he dubbed them, performed two shows in the Firebird Lounge of the Carnival Legend. The band included Steven Page (vocals, guitar), Jay Coyle (drums, vocals), Chandler Coyle (Bass) and Allan Fogul (guitar, vocals). The band performed with Page on each of the Ladies' subsequent cruises: in January 2008, two shows in the Carnival Victory's Adriatic Lounge on Ships and Dip III (with Craig Northey (guitar, vocals) and Murray Atkinson (guitar, vocals, keyboards) from the New Odds in place of Fogul); and in January 2009, one show on Ships and Dip V in the Spinnaker Lounge on the Norwegian Jewel (with Doug Elliot (bass), also of the Odds, in place of Chandler Coyle).\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\n"}

Erected to secure the region against the French, the fort is in upstate New York near the town of Crown Point and was the largest earthen fortress built in the United States. The fort's ruins, a National Historic Landmark, are now administered as part of Crown Point State Historic Site.\n\nThe French built a fortress at Crown Point in the 1730s with thick limestone walls named Fort St. Frederic. British forces targeted it twice during the French and Indian War before the French destroyed it in the summer of 1759.\n\nThe Crown Point fort was constructed by the British army under the command of Sir Jeffery Amherst following the capture of Carillon, a French fort to the south (which he renamed Ticonderoga) and the destruction of Fort St. Frédéric. Amherst used the construction of the fort as a means of keeping his men working through the winter of 1759 after pushing the French into modern Canada. Israel Putnam, who would later become a major general in the American Revolution, supervised much of the construction. According to archaeologist David R. Starbuck, Crown Point was \"the greatest British military installation ever raised in North America.\"\n\nThe fort was never directly assaulted. Mostly built after the threat of French invasion had ended, it was used largely for staging rather than as a position in its own right. On April 21, 1773, a chimney fire broke out in the soldier's barracks. It quickly spread, burning for days. In May 1774, British military engineer John Montresor described the fort (post fire) with the following words: \"the conflagration of the late fort has rendered it an amazing useless mass of earth only\". Montresor proposed expanding and improving one of the outworks rather than attempting to repair the main fort.\n\nAfter the French and Indian War, the British left a skeletal force at the fort. They quickly yielded to Capt. Seth Warner and 100 Green Mountain Boys, a Patriot American militia, on May 12, 1775 in the battle of Crown Point at the start of the Revolutionary War. The Americans captured 111 cannons from the British at Crown Point, and transported 29 to Boston for the defense of Boston Harbor.\n\nThe fort was used as a staging ground by Benedict Arnold during the Revolution for his navy on Lake Champlain. After the destruction of that navy in 1776 during the Battle of Valcour Island, the fort was abandoned to the British in 1777 after the failure of the patriot Invasion of Canada. In 1780 the British abandoned the fort and, following their success in the Revolution, the United States had no need for it, so left it to deteriorate.\n\nThe large earthen walls of the Fort are still visible today in the 21st century. The fire of April 1773 had entirely destroyed the log and earth fortress. The stone ruins of two barracks buildings at the site are being preserved.\n\nThe fort was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968.\n\n\n\n"}

Production on new episodes quietly halted in June 2016 following the release of new fan film guidelines by CBS/Paramount in response to the \"Star Trek: Axanar\" controversy, with three episodes in post-production left unreleased. The sets constructed for \"New Voyages\" were licensed as a 'Studio Set Tour' beginning in July 2016.\n\nThe series was the first such show with extensive standing sets, and that it has attracted the talents of a number of professional writers and actors associated with official \"Star Trek\" productions, including George Takei reprising his role as Sulu in \"\", and Walter Koenig as Chekov in \"To Serve All My Days\". Eugene Roddenberry Jr., the son of \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry, served as consulting producer.\n\nThe show's episode \"World Enough and Time\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2008, alongside episodes of \"Doctor Who\", \"Torchwood\", and \"Battlestar Galactica\", but lost to the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Blink.\"\n\n\"Star Trek: New Voyages\" was created by James Cawley in April 2003. Jack Marshall came aboard as a producer with the idea to market the series on the internet. The first episode, \"Come What May\", debuted on the internet on January 2004. The first episodes were filmed on new sets at a long-shuttered car dealership in Port Henry, New York, but production eventually moved to a former Family Dollar store at 112 Montcalm St. in downtown Ticonderoga, New York. This facility is currently open to the public for tours and is officially licensed by CBS. Tour information is available at www.startrektour.com\n\nFor a five-episode run beginning with \"Blood and Fire\" in December 2008 and ending with \"Kitumba\" in December 2013 the series title was changed to \"Star Trek: Phase II\" before reverting to \"New Voyages\".\n\n\"New Voyages\" creator James Cawley himself portrayed Captain Kirk in the first nine episodes before turning the role over to Brian Gross, choosing to assume a more behind-the-scenes role.\n\nBetween January 2004 and May 2016 some 11 full-length episodes and a number of short-form \"vignettes\" were released (see linked article). Three episodes were scripted by professional \"Star Trek\" writers: \"To Serve All My Days\" by Dorothy Fontana; \"\" by Marc Scott Zicree; and the two-part \"Blood and Fire\" by David Gerrold. Two other episodes were based on unfilmed stories for the unproduced 1978 Star Trek Phase II TV series: \"The Child\" and \"Kitumba\", neither with the permission of \"Star Trek\" rights-holders. Additionally, the episode \"Mind-Sifter\" was based on a piece of fan fiction from the 1970s.\n\nAs of May 2016 several additional episodes were in various stages of pre- or post-production.\n\nThe recurring actors on \"New Voyages\" are mostly unknowns who were brought to the project because of their love of \"Star Trek\". In the table below the parenthetical numbers indicate in which episodes actors appeared in given roles. Episode \"0\" is the pilot film \"Come What May\".\n\nThe \"Star Trek: New Voyages\" pilot episode was produced by James Cawley, Jack Marshall (series director at the time), Pearl Marshall, Max Rem and Jerry Yuen. Episodes 1 was produced by James Cawley, Jack Marshall, Pearl Marshall, Max Rem, Amanda Stryker, James Lowe, Jeff Quinn, John Muenchrath and Rod Roddenberry (Gene Roddenberry's son). Episode 2 was produced by James Cawley, Jack Marshall, Erik Goodrich, James Lowe, Jeff Quinn, John Muenchrath and Rod Roddenberry.\n\nThe pilot and the first two episodes were directed by Jack Marshall. However, after filming of \"To Serve All My Days\" it was announced (December 29, 2005) that Marshall would leave the series. Max Rem continued his participation for another 6 months of post production and then also left the project.\n\nJuly 2013 saw major announcements for production of the series, with James Cawley leaving the role of Captain Kirk to focus solely on production of the show and original series writer David Gerrold taking on the duties of Executive Showrunner in hopes of producing episodes with greater regularity. Gerrold also personally announced that due to an overwhelming backlog, the show would no longer accept script submissions, nor would any episodes based on existing \"Star Trek\" books, comics, stories or other published works be adapted to the series – due to a request by CBS legal in the fall of 2011. Rather, all further episodes will come from original works by previous \"Star Trek\" writers or crew associated with the series.\n\nSeveral past members of the \"Star Trek\" cast and crew have expressed support for the project, and even contributed to it.\n\nThe first episode, \"In Harm's Way,\" features Eugene \"Rod\" Roddenberry, Jr., the son of \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry, as a consulting producer. Sam Witwer (\"Crashdown\" from \"Battlestar Galactica\", Doomsday in \"Smallville\" and Galen Marek from \"\") is the voice of the Guardian of Forever (credited as \"Simon Judas Raye\").\n\nFor the second episode, \"To Serve All My Days,\" written by original series writer D.C. Fontana, original cast member Walter Koenig reprises his role as Pavel Chekov. Mary-Linda Rapelye (Irina Galliulin in the original series episode \"The Way to Eden\") appears as an ambassador.\n\nThe third episode, \"World Enough and Time,\" was co-authored by Marc Scott Zicree and Michael Reaves. Zicree, who also directed the episode, contributed the stories for the \"\" episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and \"Far Beyond the Stars\" for \"\". Reaves, who co-wrote (with Diane Duane) the \"Where No One Has Gone Before\" episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", originally pitched a story to the unproduced \"\" series in which Sulu ages by thirty years, and that story served as the basis for this \"New Voyages\" episode. Majel Barrett Roddenberry provided the computer voice in this episode.\n\nDavid Gerrold (author of \"TOS\" episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\") has signed on to pen two episodes. One, originally entitled \"Blood and Fire,\" was originally pitched for \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", but was rejected. Gerrold later claimed the story was rejected because it dealt with homosexuality and AIDS. It was later re-worked as the third book in his \"Star Wolf\" series of novels. Denise Crosby guest starred as Natasha Yar's grandmother, Dr. Jenna Yar, in David Gerrold's \"Blood and Fire.\" In addition, Bill Blair guest starred as Commander Blodgett, and \"The Amazing Race\" host Phil Keoghan made a cameo appearance as Admiral Keoghan.\n\nLike all fan-films, \"New Voyages\" exists at the whim of the \"Star Trek\" franchise owners CBS (and previously Paramount Pictures), which has to date tolerated the distribution of fan-created material as long as no attempt was made to profit from it.\n\nThis tolerance was tested in early 2012 when \"New Voyages\" announced that they would film \"He Walked Among Us,\" an unproduced script that Norman Spinrad had sold to the original series. But when CBS claimed ownership of the material, the plans were canceled. CBS had not protested over the series' use of \"Blood and Fire\", which had been written for \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"; \"The Child\", and \"Kitumba\", which had been similarly developed in the late 1970s for the aborted series \"\", or \"Mind-Sifter\" published by Bantam Books, because they were written before the \"Star Trek\" movies directed by JJ Abrams were in production. (\"The Child\" was produced for \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.) CBS wants to keep all material it has previously purchased or licensed in any way as possible work to be drawn on for future licensed films.\n\nThe pilot episode, \"Come What May\", begins with the late-1960s NBC \"In Living Color\" sequence. It ends, as did the 1960s episodes, with the animated Desilu Productions logo, with no mention of Paramount. Starting with \"Enemy: Starfleet\", the series uses the late-60s CBS color opening (reflecting the series' current ownership by CBS Television Studios) and ends with the logo of Cawley Entertainment Company, Cawley's production company.\n\n\n"}

It also is used to make stews such as fricot, and in meat pies. It is usually available year-round in local grocery stores in dried form and is used in varying proportions, sometimes added to recipes in large generous heaping spoonfuls (such as in '), and sometimes more subtly (as in beans, for which savory has a natural affinity). Summer savory is a characteristic ingredient of herbes de Provence. It is also widely used as a seasoning for grilled meats and barbecues, as well as in stews and sauces.\n\nSummer savory is preferred over winter savory for use in sausages because of its sweeter, more delicate aroma. It plays an important role in Bulgarian cuisine, providing a strong flavor to a variety of dishes. Instead of salt and pepper, a Bulgarian table will have three condiments: salt, red sweet pepper,and summer savory. When these are mixed it is called sharena sol ( 'colorful salt').\n\nSummer savory is used in Romanian cuisine, especially in sarmale (stuffed cabbage or grape leaf rolls).\n\nThe plant is called \" in German, \n\" in Dutch, \n\" in French, \n\" in Italian, \n\" in Portuguese, \n\" in Spanish, \n\" in Polish, \n\" in Romanian, \n\" in Hungarian \n\nSummer savory is raised from seed grown in a rich, light soil. The seeds are very slow in germinating.\n\nThe early spring seedlings are often topped for fresh use in June. When the plants are in flower, they may be pulled up and dried for winter use.\n\n\n\n"}

A simple example of a pair of skew lines is the pair of lines through opposite edges of a regular tetrahedron. Two lines that both lie in the same plane must either cross each other or be parallel, so skew lines can exist only in three or more dimensions. Two lines are skew if and only if they are not coplanar.\n\nIf four points are chosen at random uniformly within a unit cube, they will almost surely define a pair of skew lines. After the first three points have been chosen, the fourth point will define a non-skew line if, and only if, it is coplanar with the first three points. However, the plane through the first three points forms a subset of measure zero of the cube, and the probability that the fourth point lies on this plane is zero. If it does not, the lines defined by the points will be skew.\n\nSimilarly, in three-dimensional space a very small perturbation of any two parallel or intersecting lines will almost certainly turn them into skew lines. Therefore, any four points in general position always form skew lines.\n\nIn this sense, skew lines are the \"usual\" case, and parallel or intersecting lines are special cases.\n\nIf each line in a pair of skew lines is defined by two points that it passes through, then these four points must not be coplanar, so they must be the vertices of a tetrahedron of nonzero volume. Conversely, any two pairs of points defining a tetrahedron of nonzero volume also define a pair of skew lines. Therefore, a test of whether two pairs of points define skew lines is to apply the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its four vertices. Denoting one point as the 1×3 vector whose three elements are the point's three coordinate values, and likewise denoting , , and for the other points, we can check if the line through and is skew to the line through and by seeing if the tetrahedron volume formula gives a non-zero result:\n\nTo calculate the distance between two skew lines the lines may be expressed using vectors:\n\nHere the 1×3 vector represents an arbitrary point on the line through particular point with representing the direction of the line and with the value of the real number formula_4 determining where the point is on the line, and similarly for arbitrary point on the line through particular point in direction .\n\nThe cross product of b and d is perpendicular to the lines, as is the unit vector\n\nThe distance between the lines is then\n\n(if |b × d| is zero the lines are parallel and this method cannot be used).\n\nExpressing the two lines as vectors:\n\nLine 1: formula_7\n\nLine 2: formula_8\n\nThe cross product of formula_9 and formula_10 is perpendicular to the lines.\n\nformula_11\n\nThe plane formed by the translations of Line 2 along formula_12 contains the point formula_13 and is perpendicular to formula_14.\n\nTherefore, the intersecting point of Line 1 with the above-mentioned plane, which is also the point on Line 1 that is nearest to Line 2 is given by\n\nformula_15\n\nSimilarly, the point on Line 2 nearest to Line 1 is given by (where formula_16 )\n\nformula_17\n\nNow, formula_18 and formula_19 form the shortest line segment joining Line 1 and Line 2.\n\nA \"configuration\" of skew lines is a set of lines in which all pairs are skew. Two configurations are said to be \"isotopic\" if it is possible to continuously transform one configuration into the other, maintaining throughout the transformation the invariant that all pairs of lines remain skew. Any two configurations of two lines are easily seen to be isotopic, and configurations of the same number of lines in dimensions higher than three are always isotopic, but there exist multiple non-isotopic configurations of three or more lines in three dimensions . The number of nonisotopic configurations of \"n\" lines in R, starting at \"n\" = 1, is\n\nIf one rotates a line \"L\" around another line \"M\" skew but not perpendicular to it, the surface of revolution swept out by \"L\" is a hyperboloid of one sheet. For instance, the three hyperboloids visible in the illustration can be formed in this way by rotating a line \"L\" around the central white vertical line \"M\". The copies of \"L\" within this surface form a regulus; the hyperboloid also contains a second family of lines that are also skew to \"M\" at the same distance as \"L\" from it but with the opposite angle that form the opposite regulus. The two reguli display the hyperboloid as a ruled surface.\n\nAn affine transformation of this ruled surface produces a surface which in general has an elliptical cross-section rather than the circular cross-section produced by rotating L around L'; such surfaces are also called hyperboloids of one sheet, and again are ruled by two families of mutually skew lines. A third type of ruled surface is the hyperbolic paraboloid. Like the hyperboloid of one sheet, the hyperbolic paraboloid has two families of skew lines; in each of the two families the lines are parallel to a common plane although not to each other. Any three skew lines in R lie on exactly one ruled surface of one of these types .\n\nIf three skew lines all meet three other skew lines, any transversal of the first set of three meets any transversal of the second set.\n\nIn higher-dimensional space, a flat of dimension \"k\" is referred to as a \"k\"-flat. Thus, a line may also be called a 1-flat.\n\nGeneralizing the concept of \"skew lines\" to \"d\"-dimensional space, an \"i\"-flat and a \"j\"-flat may be skew if \n. As with lines in 3-space, skew flats are those that are neither parallel nor intersect.\n\nIn affine \"d\"-space, two flats of any dimension may be parallel.\nHowever, in projective space, parallelism does not exist; two flats must either intersect or be skew.\nLet be the set of points on an \"i\"-flat, and let be the set of points on a \"j\"-flat.\nIn projective \"d\"-space, if then the intersection of and must contain a (\"i\"+\"j\"−\"d\")-flat. (A \"0\"-flat is a point.)\n\nIn either geometry, if and intersect at a \"k\"-flat, for , then the points of determine a (\"i\"+\"j\"−\"k\")-flat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1975823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975823", "title": "Criminal jurisdiction", "text": "Criminal jurisdiction\n\nCriminal jurisdiction is a term used in constitutional law and public law to describe the power of courts to hear a case brought by a state accusing a defendant of the commission of a crime. It is relevant in three distinct situations:\n\nUnder the public international law system, de jure states are sovereign within their own territorial boundaries. A few states such as the Netherlands have adopted a monist approach, i.e. they accept international and municipal laws as part of a single system. Thus, whether a supranational court or tribunal has criminal jurisdiction over its territory or citizens, will be determined by international law. The majority of states are dualist, i.e. they will only accept international obligations through the process of incorporation, say by signing and adopting treaties and conventions. Hence, whether a supranational court or tribunal will have jurisdiction and, if so, over what subject matter and over what period of time, will be decided by the sovereign government of the day.\n\nBecause each government is supreme, it can enact whatever statutes it wishes. Thus, State A would have the power to make a law which, for example, made it an offence to smoke in the streets of State B, a neighbouring state. State A could employ officers and equip them with cameras. These officers could then collect evidence in State B and, when its citizens returned home, State A could prosecute them for breach of the law. But State A's law could not be directly effective in State B because that would make State B less than sovereign. Similarly, State A could not seek the extradition of its own citizens from State B unless State B was formally to consent (usually through the negotiation of a treaty including the particular offence).\n\nTransborder crimes take place in more than one state. For example, a defendant may fire a gun, post a package, or write or speak words in State A, but the effects of each action are felt in State B. Some states claim a public policy justification to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by, or crimes committed against their citizens, even though these crimes are committed outside their borders. Thus, one of the classifications of crime is \"crimes against the state\". These are crimes that affect the interests of the state or its administration. In extreme cases, a state may wish to prosecute one of its own citizens for treason even though all the relevant acts and omissions took place in another state. Similarly, if a citizen of State A is acting in a way that interferes with the friendly relations between State A and State B, it may be expedient to prosecute this citizen no matter where the relevant acts have been committed. Jurisdiction may also be claimed over crimes on board the ships and aircraft operated by corporations based in the given state, no matter where these craft may be located at the relevant time. In English law, where murder and manslaughter are concerned, the English court has jurisdiction over offences committed abroad, if committed by a British citizen (see section 9 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and section 3 of the British Nationality Act 1948). In \"R v Cheong\" (2006) AER (D) 385 the appellant was living in Guyana in 1983. He shot and killed a man who had just robbed his wife and sister-in-law. Under local law he was charged only with the unlicensed possession of a firearm; but as a British citizen, section 9 of the 1861 Act applied 19 years after he returned to England and he was charged with murder. On appeal, a conviction for manslaughter was upheld. At a level of conventional policy, there are two main theories to justify the exercise of jurisdiction:\n\nThe state in which the sequence of events begins, claims jurisdiction because the accused did everything in his or her power to commit the offence within its territory. Intending to deceive Y into parting with money, X writes a begging letter claiming to be a penniless widow with ten starving children and posts it in State A. X must then rely on the postal workers to carry the letter to Y in State B. No matter how hard X tries, X cannot take any further action to promote the scheme, and whether it succeeds or fails is entirely outside his or her ability to control. There are three theoretical issues to consider:\nIn English law, see the definition of a deception which must be the operative cause of the \"obtaining\" in the deception offences and under the Theft Act 1978, and note that all the inchoate offencess move in time and across borders so that an attempt continues from the proximate act until failure, a conspiracy agreement is not limited to a particular place, and the encouragement by a secondary party as an accessory continues until the principal commits the substantive offence.\n\nIf the injury or damage affects a citizen within the territory of a state, it would be usual for that state to claim jurisdiction to protect the interests of those who are present within its borders. But X would not have taken any action within State B's borders, so the wording of the \"actus reus\" must permit a prosecution in this situation. The theoretical justification for this jurisdiction may be that X has intended to cause the loss or injury and so should not escape liability through the device of only seeking to deceive those resident outside State A (a strategy that would be very simple given the internet). The justification is less clear when the place of injury is an accident. Within a single state, the doctrine of transferred intent would apply to criminalise accidental departures from a planned attack, but if X's letter is redirected out of State A by one of Y's helpful relatives, the receipt of the letter by Y on holiday in State B is entirely outside X's actual intention (just it might be irrelevant to a sender where the recipient of an e-mail is resident). Alternatively, suppose that X physically attacks Y in State A, intending to kill him. Both are nationals of State A. Y is seriously injured and, because the hospitals in State B have a superior track record for treating injuries of this type, Y arranges to be transferred to State B where he later dies. Again, there is no causal connection between X's initial criminal acts and the territory of State B, and seeking to found jurisdiction simply on the ground that Y died within its borders, is not wholly convincing given that Y is not a national of State B and so neither owes allegiance nor is owed any duty of protection as a part of State B's social contract.\n\nThe United States is a federation of states. The U.S. Constitution creates a federal government and legislature which has general powers over the territory of the whole and over foreign policy, whereas the individual states have their own governments that, within the scope allowed by the federal constitution, have local territorial jurisdiction. There is a system of federal courts which have jurisdiction to hear charges alleging federal crimes, and state courts have jurisdiction to hear charges alleging violations of local state law.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the power of Congress to enact criminal statutes is limited; the federal government lacks \"plenary criminal jurisdiction.\" The powers of Congress to enact criminal laws \"are not boundless.\" The U.S. Constitution mentions explicit authority for Congress in three areas: (1) counterfeiting, (2) piracy and felony on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations, and (3) treason. However, the \"necessary and proper\" clause of the Constitution gives Congress \"broad power to enact laws that are 'convenient or useful' or 'conductive' to the authority's 'beneficial exercise' \".\n\nThe United States district courts have original, exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over \"all offenses against the laws of the United States.\"\n\nSome crimes are related to areas owned by or under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. Examples of these crimes include those committed in the District of Columbia, in U.S. Territories, in U.S. National Parks, in federal courthouses and federal prisons, and aboard airplanes (regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration) and ocean-going vessels. The United States military has its own criminal justice system applicable to its members, and civilians may be charged with a federal crime for acts committed on military bases. Federal courts also have jurisdiction to hear cases brought against U.S. citizens based on their illegal activities in other countries.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment calls for trial “by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.” Within the federal court system, Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifies which federal court may hear a particular criminal case:\n\n\"Anderson\", 328 U.S., at 703 holds: “[T]he \"locus delicti\" must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.” In \"Hyde v. United States\", 225 U.S. 347 (1912) although none of the defendants had entered the District of Columbia as part of their conspiracy to defraud the United States, they were convicted because one co-conspirator had committed overt acts in Columbia (225 U.S., at 363). So conspiracy is a continuing offense committed in all the districts where a co-conspirator acts on the agreement. Similarly, \"In re Palliser\", 136 U.S. 257 (1890) the sending of letters from New York to postmasters in Connecticut in an attempt to gain postage on credit, made Connecticut, where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received, an appropriate venue (136 U.S., at 266—268). See 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a):\nThis was applied in \"United States v. Johnson\", 323 U.S. 273, 275 (1944) so that “an illegal use of the mails … may subject the user to prosecution in the district where he sent the goods, or in the district of their arrival, or in any intervening district.”\n\nThis system works well when there is a clear line of demarcation between the two state jurisdictions, or between a state and federal jurisdictions, and prosecutions may be initiated in the appropriate court. But laws and rules are not always so clear.\n\nSome crimes have national significance and, to reflect the public interest, their investigation and prosecution will fall to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Justice. This creates tensions between the two systems because the individual states in which aspects of the criminal activity have taken place may wish to assert jurisdiction over that part, whereas the federal authorities will wish to consolidate the wrongdoing across several states into a single trial.\n\nOne significant result of the concurrent jurisdiction between state and federal courts (and in some cases between different state courts) is that an individual who violates both state and federal law, or the laws of multiple states, can be separately charged and tried in each jurisdiction. Thus, a resident of Virginia who defrauds a Florida resident through the mail may be tried in Virginia state court and in a Florida state court, and in a federal court in either Florida \"or\" Virginia. A famous example of dual state and federal sovereignty is the Rodney King case. Police officers who beat motorist Rodney King were acquitted of assault charges in the California state court, but were convicted of violating King's civil rights - based on the same events - in a federal court in California.\n"}

He was one of the most famous and distinguished composers of monody.\n\nSaracini was born to a noble family, probably in Siena. Little is known for certain about his education, but it is presumed that he traveled widely while he was young, for not only did he establish numerous foreign connections—as evidenced by his dedications of music to foreign aristocrats—but he absorbed some of the musical styles of the lands he visited. He seems never to have held a professional musical position of which record has survived; indeed he seems to have been an extraordinarily talented amateur, one who was admired even by Claudio Monteverdi. The references to Saracini as \"Il Palusi\" seem to indicate that he was a member of an academy, although further details are lacking.\n\nAll of his music was published in Venice between 1614 and 1624.\n\nOf his music, 133 songs have survived, and all are monodies—secular compositions for solo voice, generally sung in a highly ornamented style, with instrumental accompaniment. All but one are in Italian, and encompass a wide range of texts, including serious, humorous, and erotic. His style varies from diatonic to chromatic, and is comparable to that of contemporary monodist Sigismondo d'India in its experimental qualities.\n\nA unique feature of Saracini's compositions is the occasional influence of folk music, including that of the Balkans, an extreme rarity in early Italian Baroque music. Presumably he heard folk music in those regions when he traveled there during his youth. This influence is most evident in his strophic songs, one of which is in 5/4 (although actually notated in duple meter); asymmetrical meters are a normal feature of Balkan folk music but are absent in Italian.\n\nSaracini's works have had a resurgence of interest in the 20th century, after a long period of neglect. His experimental idiom first attracted the attention of musicologists, and later, performers; his compositions are now recorded relatively frequently, often on collections containing works of other composers of the same era, such as Monteverdi or Alessandro Grandi.\n\n"}

The castle ruins are located on the shore of the Vistula Lagoon, north of Mamonovo in the Pogranichny municipality of Bagrationovsky District, about southwest of Kaliningrad.\n\nThe hill of Balga had been the site of an Old Prussian (Warmian) fortress called Honeda. The fort had been unsuccessfully besieged by the Wettin margrave Henry III of Meissen on his 1237 Prussian Crusade, but was eventually conquered in 1239 by the forces of the Teutonic Order, led by Grand Marshal Dietrich von Bernheim. Balga was the oldest Ordensburg constructed by the Teutonic Order in the region of present-day Kaliningrad Oblast, and was built from 1239 to control naval traffic on the Vistula Lagoon. With the assistance of Duke Otto I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the Teutonic Knights defeated the Old Prussians along the coastline of Warmia and Natangia. The subjugation of these pagan peoples led Duke Świętopełk II of Pomerania to declare war against the Teutonic Order during the 1242 Prussian uprising, although he was eventually forced to abandon his participation in the uprising. From 1250, Balga was the administrative centre of \"Kommende Balga\" and the seat of a Komtur of the Teutonic Knights. Many Komturs at Balga like Winrich von Kniprode or Ulrich von Jungingen later rose to the office of the Grand Master, the highest position in the Teutonic Order. \n\nIn 1499, Grand Master Friedrich von Sachsen had the Kommende dissolved, and upon the Prussian Homage, Balga was part of the Polish Duchy of Prussia in 1525, and the castle became the residence of George of Polentz, Bishop of Samland. \n\nFrom 1627, parts of the castle were broken down at the behest of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Polish–Swedish War in order to gain building material for the construction of the star fort in Pillau (now Baltiysk), a strategically important port town occupied by the Swedes. Balga was located in the Duchy of Prussia from 1525 and the Kingdom of Prussia from 1701, where between 1772 and 1829 it belonged to the province of East Prussia. The province was unified with West Prussia into the Province of Prussia until 1878, when it separated once again and Balga remained in East Prussia until 1945. \n\nDuring World War II the castle ruins were the site of one of the final battles between the German Wehrmacht and the Soviet Red Army, with the latter advancing during the East Prussian Offensive. The German defenders destroyed numerous vehicles by sinking them in the lagoon next to the ruins, and the battle extensively damaged the castle remains. Following the war Balga was in the section of East Prussia allocated to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference, and included in the area that was organized into Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR. The area around Balga became a popular site for grave robbers and treasure hunters hoping to dig up valuables left behind by the castle's previous occupants and the German and Soviet soldiers who died in World War II. \n\nBalga was also the name of a nearby village, which after Soviet sovereignty over the area was renamed Vesyoloye, but is now abandoned.\n\n"}

In June 1913, the Commission, which consisted of Governor William C. McDonald, Attorney General Frank W. Clancy, Chief Justice Clarence J. Roberts and Secretary of State Antonio Lucero, filed its report adopting the general design of the Territorial Seal, substituting only the date 1912. That seal is still in use today as the official seal of New Mexico.\n\nThe official act of the legislature reads:\n\nThe \"American eagle\" is an American bald eagle. The \"Mexican eagle\" with serpent and cactus is from the coat of arms of Mexico, in turn derived from an Aztec myth of the foundation of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. Although in Mexico the Mexican eagle is understood to be an American golden eagle, the New Mexico seal uses an American harpy eagle. Mexico adopted its coat of arms when it was under Spanish rule, and New Mexico identified with it as well. On the New Mexico seal, it symbolizes that the state still holds on to its Spanish, Mexican and Native American traditions. The Mexican eagle is small and shielded by the larger American eagle, which grasps arrows in its talons, its wings outstretched with its watchful eyes guarding the Mexican eagle. This configuration is meant to show the change of sovereignty in 1846 between Mexico and the United States. It also symbolizes America's dominant yet delicate protection of New Mexico and its heritage and culture.\n\n\"1912\". Originally, New Mexico's territorial seal was engraved with MDCCCL (1850 in Roman numerals) to commemorate the date New Mexico was organized as a territory. But after it was admitted as a state, the commission decided that that was a better date to use on the seal. They decided against using Roman numerals, believing it was too pretentious.\n\n\"Great Seal of the State of New Mexico\". No one is quite sure who came up with the term, but it appeared on New Mexico's first state seal, and was added to the seal adopted in 1913, untouched — with the small exception of changing the word \"Territory\" to \"State\".\n\nThe official motto of New Mexico is '. Translated from Latin, it means \"It grows as it goes\" and has been criticized for appearing strange or even nonsensical at first hearing. However, the intended effect is more clear if one considers it within the context of its source in the epic poem ' (\"On the Nature of Things\") by first-century B.C. Latin poet Lucretius. Here, it refers to a thunderbolt increasing in strength as it moves across the sky, referenced by the selectors of the motto as a symbol of dynamic progress.\n\nThe motto was first used in 1882, when acting Territorial Secretary William G. Ritch added the Latin phrase ' to an early 1860s version of the territorial seal. In 1887, Ritch's version of the seal, including the words ', was adopted by the legislature as part of the official New Mexico Territory seal and coat of arms. When New Mexico became a state in 1912, the Legislature appointed a commission to settle on a design for an official state seal. The commission recommended the territorial seal to be continued as the state seal, including the words \"\" which were then adopted as the official state motto. However, the commission's recommendation that the American and Mexican eagles both be American golden eagles, a change omitted from the 1915 law.\n\nNew Mexico's first seal was designed shortly after the organization of the Territorial Government, in 1851. The original seal has long since disappeared, possibly as part of the artifacts placed into the cornerstone of the Soldiers' Monument in the Santa Fe Plaza. Imprints of the original seal show it consisted of the American eagle, clutching an olive branch in one talon and three arrows in the other. Along the outside rim was the inscription \"Great Seal of the Territory of New Mexico\".\n\nIn the early 1860s an unknown official adopted a new seal, using a design similar to today's Great Seal. It featured the American bald eagle, its outstretched wings shielding a smaller Mexican eagle. The outside rim of the seal contained the words \"Territory of New Mexico,\" with the date of 1850 along the bottom in Roman numerals.\nIn 1882, Territorial Secretary W.G. Ritch embellished the earlier design with the phrase \"crescit eundo\". This version was liked so much it was adopted as New Mexico's \"official seal and coat of arms\" by the Territorial Legislature in 1887. Ritch had no apparent motive for the change, but it fit well.\n\nIn the year and half it took the Commission to decide to adopt the State Seal New Mexico uses today, the Legislature authorized interim use of the Territorial Seal with the words \"Great Seal of the State of New Mexico\" substituted.\n\n\n"}

The Iraq Currency Board pursued a \"conservative monetary policy, maintaining very high reserves behind the dinar\", which was \"further strengthened by its link to the British pound\".\n\nIn 1949, the currency board was replaced by the National Bank of Iraq, which had been founded two years before on November 16, 1947. The National Bank of Iraq became the Central Bank of Iraq in 1956. Since switching over to its own central bank, the Iraqi monetary system was \"replete with mismanagement, coercive stop-gap measures, and the production of an unstable, unreliable currency which ha[d] not been tradable on the international market for [many] years\". Saddam Hussein wielded monetary and the dinar as \"a powerful instrument of repression\".\n\nIn March 2003, on several occasions beginning on March 18, the day before United States forces entered Baghdad, nearly US$1 billion was stolen from the Central Bank of Iraq. This was considered the largest bank heist in history until 2011. That month, a handwritten note signed by Saddam Hussein surfaced, ordering $920 million to be withdrawn and given to his son Qusay Hussein. Bank officials state that Qusay and another unidentified man oversaw the cash, boxes of $100 bills secured with stamped seals known as security money, being loaded into trucks and trailers during a five-hour operation. Qusay Hussein was later killed by the U.S. military in a battle.\n\nAfter the 2003 invasion of Iraq and Saddam Hussein's downfall, the Central Bank of Iraq was established as Iraq's independent central bank by the Central Bank of Iraq Law 2004, with authorised capital of 100 billion dinars. According to the law, 100% of the bank's capital stock would be held by the State and would not be transferable.\nThe Constitution of Iraq states that the central bank is a financially and administratively independent institution, responsible before the Council of Representatives of Iraq. According to the Constitution, the Federal government of Iraq has the \"exclusive authority\" of \"establishing and administering a central bank\".\n\nOn 25 January 2011, the Supreme Court of Iraq ruled that the Central Bank of Iraq should be under supervision of the Council of Ministers of Iraq. Then Central Bank chief Sinan Al Shabibi warned that the ruling would threaten the institution's requisite independence.\n\nCurrently the acting Governor of the Central Bank of Iraq is Abdel Basset Turki, which also happens to be the head of the state-spending watchdog the Board of Supreme Audit.\n\nIn June 2014, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militants looted the Central Bank in Mosul, absconding with over $429 million USD.\n\nGovernors of the Central Bank of Iraq since its establishment\n\n\nThe bank headquarters were designed by Danish architects Dissing+Weitling and was completed in 1985. It is a cubical building constructed of reinforced concrete clad in marble. It has few exterior openings, and is instead organised around an inner courtyard which cuts through the heart of the structure and rises to a height of 40m. The courtyard is surrounded on all sides by offices separated by an interior glass curtain wall.\n\nIn August 2010, architect Zaha Hadid, born in Baghdad, was appointed to design a new headquarters for the Central Bank in Baghdad. Initial talks about the project were held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 14 August 2010, in the presence of the Central Bank Governor Sinan Al Shabibi. On 2 February 2012, Zaha Hadid joined Sinan Al Shabibi at a ceremony in London to sign the agreement between the Central Bank of Iraq and Zaha Hadid Architects for the design stages of the new CBI Headquarters building.\n\nAs of at least 28 March 2011, the official web site of the CBI states \"the primary objectives of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) are to ensure domestic price stability and to foster a stable competitive market-based financial system.

Davis was the first President of Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong.\n\nDavis was the eldest son of East India Company director and amateur artist Samuel Davis while his mother was Henrietta Boileau, member of a refugee French noble family who had come to England in the early eighteenth century from Languedoc in the south of France.\n\nIn 1813, Davis was appointed writer at the East India Company's factory in Canton (now Guangzhou), China, at the time the centre of trade with China. Having demonstrated the depth of his learning in the Chinese language in his translation of \"The Three Dedicated Rooms\" (\"San-Yu-Low\") in 1815, he was chosen to accompany Lord Amherst on his embassy to Peking in 1816.\n\nOn the mission's return Davis returned to his duties at the Canton factory, and was promoted to president in 1832. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society the same year.\n\nDavis was appointed Second Superintendent of British Trade in China alongside Lord Napier in December 1833, superseding William Henry Chicheley Plowden in the latter's absence. After Napier's death in 1834, Davis became Chief Superintendent then resigned his position in January 1835, to be replaced by Sir George Robinson. Davis left Canton aboard the \"Asia\" on 12January.\n\nIn 1839, Davis purchased the Regency mansion Holly House, near Henbury, Bristol, where he built an observatory tower built housing a clock installed by Edward John Dent, who would later be responsible for building Big Ben. It remained the Davis family home for seven decades thereafter.\n\nHaving arrived from Bombay on HMS \"Spiteful\" on 7 May 1844, he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Hong Kong the next day. During his tenure, Davis was unpopular with Hong Kong residents and British merchants due to the imposition of various taxes, which increased the burden of all citizens, and his abrasive treatment of his subordinates. Davis organised the first Hong Kong Census in 1844, which recorded that there were 23,988 people living in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the same year, Davis exhorted China to abandon the prohibition on opium trade, on the basis of its counter productiveness, relating that, in England,\n... the system of prohibitions and high duties ... only increased the extent of smuggling, together with crimes of violence, while they diminished the revenue; until it was a length found that the fruitless expense of a large preventive force absorbed much of the amount of duty that could be collected, while prohibited articles were consumed more than ever.\n\nWeekend horse racing began during his tenure, which gradually evolved into a Hong Kong institution. Davis founded the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1847 and he was its first president.\n\nDavis left office on 21March 1848, ending unrelenting tensions with local British merchants who saw him as a stingy, arrogant and obstinate snob. His early decision to exclude all but government officials from the Executive and Legislative Councils on the basis that \"almost every person possessed of Capital, who is not connected with Government Employment, is employed in the Opium trade\" could not have made co-operation any easier. He departed the colony on 30 March via the P&O steamer \"Pekin\". He returned to England where he rejoined Emily who had stayed there throughout his Governorship.\n\nDavis married Emily, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Humfrays of the Bengal Engineers in 1822. They had one son and six daughters:\n\nIn 1867, a year after the death of his wife Emily, Davis married Lucy Ellen, eldest daughter of Reverend T. J. Locke, vicar of Exmouth, in 1867. A son, Francis Boileau, was born in 1871.\n\nHe was a created a baronet on 9 July 1845 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 12 June 1854. Having retired from government, Davis engaged in literary pursuits. In 1876, he became a Doctor of Civil Law of the University of Oxford after a donation of £1,666 in three percent consol bonds to endow a scholarship in his name for the encouragement of the study of Chinese.\n\nDavis died on 13November 1890 at his residence, Hollywood House in the Bristol suburb of Henbury, England at the age of 95 and was interred in the graveyard of Compton Greenfield Church on 18 November. As his surviving son Francis Boileau left no surviving male heirs, the Davis baronetcy died with him.\n\n\nIn 1829, Davis, a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, translated the 17th-century Chinese novel \"Haoqiu Zhuan\" under the title \"The Fortunate Union\". This was translated into French by Guillard D'Arcy in 1842. \n\nDavis also wrote an account of the events surrounding the attack on his father's house in Benares, India, in \"Vizier Ali Khan or The Massacre of Benares, A Chapter in British Indian History\", published in London in 1871. \n\nOther works include:\n\n\n\n"}

A failure of the dam on September 30, 1911 caused significant destruction and loss of life in the valley below.\n\nIn 1900, Bayless Paper chose to construct a paper mill in the Freeman Run Valley. By 1909, the company realized that occasional dry seasons required a more reliable water source. After finding a small earthen dam to be inadequate, the T. Chalkey Hatton firm built a large concrete dam across the valley. The dam was high, long and cost $86,000 to construct. It was designed to be thirty feet thick, but was built only twenty feet thick.\n\nWithin only a few months of its completion, problems were detected. The dam bowed more than under the pressure of the water it was holding and the concrete started cracking. The bowing was alleviated by using dynamite to blast a space for the excess water to spill over. The cracking was claimed to be normal because of the drying cement.\n\nOn September 30, 1911, the dam failed and destroyed the Bayless Pulp and Paper Mill as well as much of the town of Austin. The damage was approximately $10 million. It also resulted in the deaths of 78 people. A young girl named Mary Fran Simmons, a new immigrant from Galicia, warned many of the townspeople about the impending disaster with her extremely limited English, simply pointing and repeating, \"Dam! Dam!\" The paper mill and dam were subsequently rebuilt, but the mill was lost in a fire in 1933. The new dam failed in 1942 with no loss of life. The dam was not replaced after the second failure.\n\nThe ruins consist of a series of broken sections extending east to west across the Freeman Run Valley. There are five upright sections and two large and several smaller toppled sections. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.\n\nA documentary about the dam disaster, featuring narration by Willie Nelson, was created by Mansfield University of Pennsylvania professor Gale Largey in 1999.

Individuals can also write brief comments on their experiences with the teachers. As of April 2010, over eleven million teachers had been rated on the website.\n\nRMT was launched in 2001 by Mister Message, LLC and later sold to former owner Patrick Nagle. RateMyTeachers.com currently services websites in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nRateMyTeachers.com was governed by a public community of volunteers who were granted the power to add, remove and delete teacher listings and teacher ratings. The public community was replaced in 2017 by a private moderation community. The private moderation community was tasked to manually re-review every rating and teacher added to RMT since 2001. The private moderation community reviewed over 100,000 ratings a day. However, the site got rid of all reviews due to a law in Europe that doesn't allow names to be displayed without permission of the individual. This new law led to a complete remodeling of the site. RateMyTeachers no longer allows students to write comments on the teachers, but they instead format reviews for comments on the class.\n\nRateMyTeachers.com is controversial in certain circles and many have questioned its approach. The site is open to the general public with no requirement to reveal their first or last name when commenting.

In 2007, the Queensland College of Teachers called for the shutdown of the page \"until it can be established that it provides a credible service\". In 2003, the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) sought a court injunction to shut down the site, though the request was denied on free speech grounds.

They waged a small-scale war against the Medellín Cartel in the early 1990s, which ended in 1993 following the death of Escobar.\n\nThere are reports that Los Pepes had ties to some members of the Colombian National Police, especially the Search Bloc (Bloque de Búsqueda), with whom they exchanged information in order to execute their activities against Escobar. According to documents released to the public by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2008, \"Colombian National Police director general Miguel Antonio Gómez Padilla said 'that he had directed a senior CNP intelligence officer to maintain contact with Fidel Castaño, paramilitary leader of Los Pepes, for the purposes of intelligence collection'.\"\n\nGiven that the main objective of Los Pepes was to assassinate Escobar, they acted in the same way that the Medellín Cartel acted against their enemies: killing anyone who had any allegiance with Escobar, such as their guards, accountants or lawyers, in addition, to directly threatening friends and family of Pablo Escobar. They were involved in the destruction of two haciendas that belonged to Hermilda Gaviria (Escobar's mother). They were characterized by the frequent use of explosives in their attacks.\n\nAfter Escobar was shot and killed when fighting against the Search Bloc in 1993, several of their leaders eventually went on to become leaders of a national paramilitary alliance in Colombia, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a paramilitary death squad that was formed not only for the purpose of fighting the Cartel but also the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Marxist guerrilla group. The Castaño Brothers (Carlos 1965–2004, Vicente and Fidel, who went missing in 1994) were founders of several paramilitary groups and the driving force behind the AUC's creation.\n\nAnother member of Los Pepes, Diego Murillo Bejarano aka \"Don Berna\", eventually became Inspector General of the AUC as well as an important drug trafficker with The Office of Envigado.\n\nThe Institute for Policy Studies is searching for details of what connections the CIA and DEA had to Los Pepes. They have launched a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act against the CIA. That suit has resulted in the declassification of thousands of documents from the CIA as well as other U.S. agencies including the Department of State, Drug Enforcement Administration, Defense Intelligence Agency and the U.S Coast Guard. These documents have been made public at the website Pepes Project.\n\nMark Bowden's book \"Killing Pablo\" highlights some of the operations of Los Pepes and describes some of the forms of cooperation and support that the group allegedly received from members of the Colombian National Police.\n\nLos Pepes are featured in the second season of the Netflix television series \"Narcos\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1975883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975883", "title": "School of Paris", "text": "School of Paris\n\nSchool of Paris () refers to the French and émigré artists who worked in Paris in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe School of Paris was not a single art movement or institution, but refers to the importance of Paris as a center of Western art in the early decades of the 20th century. Between 1900 and 1940 the city drew artists from all over the world and became a centre for artistic activity. \"School of Paris\" was used to describe this loose community, particularly of non-French artists, centered in the cafes, salons and shared workspaces and galleries of Montparnasse.\n\nBefore World War I the name was also applied to artists involved in the many collaborations and overlapping new art movements, between post-Impressionists and pointillism and Orphism, Fauvism and Cubism. In that period the artistic ferment took place in Montmartre and the well-established art scene there. But Picasso moved away, the war scattered almost everyone, by the 1920s Montparnasse had become a center of the avant-garde. After World War II the name was applied to another different group of abstract artists.\n\nBefore World War I, a group of expatriates in Paris created art in the styles of Post-Impressionism, Cubism and Fauvism. The group included artists like Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Piet Mondrian. Associated French artists included Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes. Picasso and Matisse have been described as the twin leaders (\"chefs d’école\") of the school before the war.\n\nThe term \"School of Paris\" was used in 1925 by to refer to the many foreign-born artists who had migrated to Paris. The term soon gained currency, often as a derogatory label by critics who saw the foreign artists—many of whom were Jewish—as a threat to the purity of French art. Art critic Louis Vauxcelles, noted for coining the terms \"Fauvism\" and \"Cubism\" (also meant disparagingly), called immigrant artists unwashed \"Slavs disguised as representatives of French art\". Waldemar George, himself a French Jew, in 1931 lamented that the School of Paris name \"allows any artist to pretend he is French...it refers to French tradition but instead annihilates it.\"\n\nSchool of Paris artists were progressively marginalized. Beginning in 1935 art publications no longer wrote about Chagall, just magazines for Jewish audiences, and by June 1940 when the Vichy government took power, School of Paris artists could no longer exhibit in Paris at all.\n\nThe artists working in Paris between World War I and World War II experimented with various styles including Cubism, Orphism, Surrealism and Dada. Foreign and French artists working in Paris included Jean Arp, Joan Miró, Constantin Brâncuși, Raoul Dufy, Tsuguharu Foujita, artists from Belarus like Michel Kikoine, Pinchus Kremegne, the Lithuanian Jacques Lipchitz, the Polish artists Marek Szwarc and Morice Lipsi and others such as Russian-born prince Alexis Arapoff.\n\nA significant subset, the Jewish artists, came to be known as the Jewish School of Paris or the School of Montparnasse. The \"core members were almost all Jews, and the resentment expressed toward them by French critics in the 1930s was unquestionably fueled by anti-Semitism.\" One account points to the 1924 Salon des Indépendants, which decided to separate the works of French-born artists from those by immigrants; in response critic referred to them as the School of Paris. Jewish members of the group included Emmanuel Mané-Katz, Chaim Soutine, Adolphe Féder, Chagall, Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel, Moïse Kisling, Maxa Nordau and Shimshon Holzman.\n\nThe artists of the Jewish School of Paris were stylistically diverse. Some, like Louis Marcoussis, worked in a cubist style, but most tended toward expression of mood rather than an emphasis on formal structure. Their paintings often feature thickly brushed or troweled impasto. The Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme has works from School of Paris artists including Pascin, Kikoine, Soutine, Orloff and Lipschitz.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, \"nationalistic and anti-Semitic attitudes were discredited, and the term took on a more general use denoting both foreign and French artists in Paris\". But although the \"Jewish problem\" trope continued to surface in public discourse, art critics ceased making ethnic distinctions in using the term. While in the early 20th century French art critics contrasted The School of Paris and the École de France, after World War II the question was School of Paris vs School of New York.\n\nPost-World War II (\"Après-guerre\"), the term \"School of Paris\" often referred to tachisme, and lyrical abstraction, a European parallel to American Abstract Expressionism. These artists are also related to CoBrA. Important proponents were Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, Jean-Michel Coulon, Nicolas de Staël, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff, Bram van Velde, Georges Mathieu, Jean Messagier and Zoran Mušič, among others. Many of their exhibitions took place at the Galerie de France in Paris, and then at the Salon de Mai where a group of them exhibited until the 1970s.\n\n\n\nIn the same period, the School of Paris name was also extended to an informal association of classical composers, émigrés from Central and Eastern Europe to who met at the Café Du Dôme in Montparnasse. They included Alexandre Tansman, Alexander Tcherepnin, Bohuslav Martinů and Tibor Harsányi. Unlike Les Six, another group of Montparnasse musicians at this time, the musical school of Paris was a loosely-knit group that did not adhere to any particular stylistic orientation.\n\n\n"}

The name is a Spanish diminutive form of \"bizcocho.\" The dough is rolled and traditionally cut into the shape of stars and crescent moons.\n\nThe cookie was developed by residents of New Mexico over the centuries from the first Spanish colonists of what was then known as Santa Fe de Nuevo México. The recipe for making the cookie has been greatly influenced not only by local and indigenous customs but also by recipes brought to New Mexico by immigrants from other Hispanic countries. \n\nBiscochitos are served during special celebrations, such as wedding receptions, baptisms, and religious holidays (especially during the Christmas season). It is commonly served along with hot chocolate. The cookie is seldom known outside the boundaries of the original Spanish province, although Spanish speakers may recognize the association with bizcocho, from the name, and may have some idea of what they must be, even if they have not encountered them before.\n\nIn 1989, the U.S. State of New Mexico made the biscochito its official state cookie. This act made New Mexico the first U.S. state to have an official state cookie. It was chosen to help maintain traditional home-baked cookery.\n\n"}
{"id": "1975890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975890", "title": "British South Africa Police", "text": "British South Africa Police\n\nThe British South Africa Police (BSAP) was, for most of its existence, the police force of Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980). It was formed as a paramilitary force of mounted infantrymen in 1889 by Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company, from which it took its original name, the British South Africa Company's Police. Initially run directly by the company, it began to operate independently in 1896, at which time it also dropped \"Company's\" from its name. It thereafter served as Rhodesia's regular police force, retaining its name, until 1980, when it was superseded by the Zimbabwe Republic Police, soon after the country's reconstitution into Zimbabwe in April that year.\n\nWhile it was in the main a law enforcement organisation, the line between police and military was significantly blurred. BSAP officers trained both as policemen and regular soldiers until 1954. BSAP men served in the latter role during the First and Second World Wars, and also provided several support units to the Rhodesian Bush War of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nDuring the Bush War, the BSAP operated several anti-guerrilla units, most prominently the Police Anti-Terrorist Unit, which tracked and engaged Communist guerrillas; the Support Unit, which was a police field force, nicknamed the \"Black Boots\" because of the colour of their footwear; and the Civilian African Tracking Unit, composed mostly of black Rhodesian trackers utilising the traditional skills and techniques of the Shangaan people.\n\nBy 1980, the BSAP comprised about 46,000 personnel; 11,000 professionals (about 60% black), and the remainder reservists (mostly white). The organisation's rank structure was unique, with different levels of seniority existing for black and white officers respectively. Until 1979, black officers could rise no further than sub-inspector, while the commissioned ranks were all-white. Limitations on black aspirations were removed in 1979. Under Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwe Republic Police immediately adopted a policy whereby senior whites were forced into retirement at the earliest opportunity and replaced by black officers.\n\nThe organisation was formed by the BSAC in 1889 as a paramilitary, mounted infantry force in order to provide protection for the Pioneer Column of settlers which moved into Mashonaland in 1890. In common with several colonial police forces such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), it was modelled on the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), and its early officers were trained at the Police Depot in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. The unit played a central role in both the First Matabele War (1893) and the Second Matabele War (1896/97) with many troopers serving in the Jameson Raid. Until 1896 the force was called the British South Africa Company's Police.\n\nThe BSAP operated originally in conjunction with the Southern Rhodesia Constabulary (SRC), the town police force for Salisbury (now Harare) and Bulawayo, but amalgamated with the SRC in 1909.\n\nAs a paramilitary unit, the BSAP fought in the Second Boer War and in German East Africa during the First World War, while some members were seconded to the Rhodesia Native Regiment. From 1923, Southern Rhodesia was a self-governing colony of the British Empire, but the BSAP retained its title and its position as the senior regiment of the Southern Rhodesian armed forces. \n\nOne of the first casualties of the BSAP in the Second World War was Keppel Bagot Levett, born in 1919, who died in active service with the BSAP in March 1941.\n\nBetween the World Wars, the Permanent Staff Corps of the Rhodesian Army consisted of only 47 men. The BSAP were trained as both policemen and soldiers until 1954.\n\nDuring the period of the Rhodesian Bush War in the late 1960s and 1970s, the BSAP formed an important part of the white minority government's fight against Communist guerrillas. The force formed a riot unit; a tracker combat team (later renamed the Police Anti-Terrorist Unit or PATU); a police field force Support Unit (who were distinguished by wearing black boots), an Urban Emergency Unit, a Police Reserve Air Wing or PRAW, and a Marine Division, and from 1973 offered places to white conscripts as part of Rhodesia's national service scheme. At independence, the force had a strength of approximately 11,000 regulars (about 60% black) and almost 35,000 reservists, of whom the overwhelming majority were white. A former BSAP officer, Daniel Carney, wrote a book titled \"Whispering Death\" about the BSAP in anti-terrorist operations which was later made into the film \"Albino\".\n\nThe BSAP's name remained unchanged by the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, although following the declaration of a republic by Ian Smith's government in 1970, the St Edward's Crown was removed from the BSAP's badge, and the appointment of Her Majesty The Queen Mother as Honorary Commissioner was suspended. In place of St. Edward's Crown, the Zimbabwe Bird was displayed on cap badges.\n\nThe British South Africa Police was renamed the Zimbabwe Republic Police in July 1980 following the installation of Robert Mugabe as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe.\n\nA Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was founded in 1923; a Women's Section in 1941, and a Dog Unit in 1945. From 1957, the Police Reserve also had an airborne wing.\n\nPrior to the use of motor vehicles, extended rural patrols were carried out on horseback, and right up until the Force was renamed all white male officers were taught equitation as part of their basic traíning. Selected officers were retained in Morris Depot after \"passing out\" and tasked with training remount horses for future use by recruits and on ceremonial duties. Mounted Escorts were provided for occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament. Generally speaking, the force was the 'Senior Service' and performed ceremonials such as those allocated to the RCMP today. As such, discipline, presentation, and parade drill were of a very high standard.\n\nThe Support Unit (known as the \"Black Boots\" due to their footwear) was a Police field force staffed by about 50 white and 1700 ( 1980) black regular and national servicemen. \n\nIn the late 1970s a Civilian African Tracking Unit (C.A.T.U.) was added, to relieve the professional trackers in the pursuing of the enemy infiltrators into Rhodesia. Their tracking methods were based on the traditional skills and techniques of the Rhodesian Shangaan tribe. Their formations were called 'sticks', and consisted of a couple of white Rhodesian 'Patrol Officers', or 'Section Officers', and six to eight black Rhodesian trackers. Police Reservists and regular police officers organised in a similar way were called the Police Anti Terrorist Unit or PATU.\n\nPolice of all ranks to chief inspector, were obliged to perform PATU secondment on a regular rotation basis, and deployed to operational areas. Riot standby units were also maintained to deal with urban civil disorder on the same basis. Counter insurgency and advanced weapons training were mandatory by the 1970s in anticipation of PATU and district duties.\n\nThe BSAP also oversaw the intelligence collection function of the Selous Scouts. That function was performed by an embedded element of the BSAP's Special Branch (SB), commanded by Chief Superintendent Michael \"Mac\" McGuinness; the SB liaison team conducted interrogations of captured guerrillas, reviewed captured documents, and collated and disseminated intelligence. The SB team also oversaw the production and insertion of poisoned clothing, food, beverages, and medicines into the guerrilla supply chain. The use of contaminated supplies resulted in the reported deaths of over 800 guerrillas, and the likely death toll probably reached well over 1,000.\n\nUntil the late 1970s, black Rhodesians could not hold ranks higher than Sub-Inspector in the BSAP, and only white Rhodesians could gain commissioned rank. This changed after moderate black leader Bishop Abel Muzorewa was elected in the 1979 elections. After Robert Mugabe took power, the force followed a racial policy \"Africanisation\", in which senior white officers were forcibly retired and their positions filled by black officers.\n\nThe rank structure was unique, black policemen (known colloquially as \"Mapolisa\") were Constables, Sergeants, Senior Sergeants, Sergeant Majors, and Sub Inspectors.\n\nThe white police (known colloquially as 'Majoni') ranks began at Patrol Officer (Single gold bar on each shoulder), proceeding to Senior patrol officer (Two gold bars), Section Officer (Three gold bars), and thereafter to Inspector, Chief Inspector and commissioned ranks etc., as per UK police rank structures. There was also a training depot rank designation of Staff Lance Section Officer (also denoted by Three gold bars).\n\nWhite officers were assigned separate mess facilities to the black police, and were obliged to employ black 'batmen'. The batmen were skilled at the presentation and maintenance of several police uniform 'dress orders' worn throughout any given day, all of which were expected to be immaculate at all times.\n\nThe responsibilities of these Caucasian police officers, once trained, were broadly the same as those of UK police officers. Black officers engaged in operational police work worked alongside their white colleagues on investigations and patrols, necessarily acting as interpreters with the indigenous population, as well as patrolling alone and conducting their own crime investigations or as otherwise directed. Black \"ground coverage\" officers acted as undercover plain clothes intelligence gatherers in both rural and urban areas.\n\nA district (rural) police station with a strength of anything from a dozen to forty personnel was often required to 'fly the flag' over an area comprising several hundred sq. kilometres.\n\nOn December 18, 1978, Equitation Squad 14/78-the first multi-racial recruit squad-began training at Morris Depot in Salisbury, now Harare. Prior to this date, Black recruits were trained at Tomlinson Depot while White Officers were trained at Morris Depot. Included in this historic intake was Patrol Officer Sinclair Roberts, the first mixed race Police Officer accepted to the Force since its inception in 1889, a span of 89 years.\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of Commissioners of the British South Africa Police from the force's amalgamation in 1909 until its dissolution in 1980.\n\n\nFrom early 1978 to 1980 Support training and selection consisted of 3 phases culminating latterly in 6 months/24 weeks training. The first phase lasting as long as 11 weeks (RLI first phase was 6 weeks). Emphasis in selection depended on extreme physical fitness and aggression (running excess of 120 kilometres per week), mental strength in decision making and problem solving under extreme duress. The selection course consisted of a junior leader assessment in all areas concerning leadership. All Counter Operations Insurgency (COIN) battle drills being held in Battle camps at Concession and Shamva. The pass rate among recruits amounted to only 30%. On passing out recruits were deployed to one of 13 and latterly 14 Troops (Troop company strength 120 men, Mantle Mounted and November troop being new additions in 1981). The Support Unit supported the Police in rural problem areas (latterly dissidents) as well as in urban emergencies. In November 1980 during the Entumbani I uprising, two sections of 60 men each from 5 Support Unit Troops, Mantle Echo, Mantle Charlie, Mantle Juliet, Mantle Hotel, Mantle Lima, 300 men in all, travelled from all over Zimbabwe to reach Bulawayo in 11 hours. Due to the Support Unit Troops being independent with their own vehicles, stores, ammunition, medical supplies, tents etc., they could deploy anywhere at a moments notice all over Zimbabwe. During the bush war the Support Unit's primary task was to patrol the long distances in the Tribal Trust Lands, to maintain and reinstate order in the kraals (native villages).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1975891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975891", "title": "Boston and Providence Railroad", "text": "Boston and Providence Railroad\n\nThe Boston and Providence Railroad was a railroad company in the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island which connected its namesake cities. It opened in two sections in 1834 and 1835 - one of the first rail lines in the United States - with a more direct route into Providence built in 1847. Branches were built to Dedham in 1834, Stoughton in 1845, and North Attleboro in 1871. It was acquired by the Old Colony Railroad in 1888, which in turn was leased by the New Haven Railroad in 1893. The line became the New Haven's primary mainline to Boston; it was realigned in Boston in 1899 during the construction of South Station, and in Pawtucket and Central Falls in 1916 for grade crossing elimination.\n\nThe line became part of the Penn Central system in 1969; the section in Massachusetts was purchased by the state in 1973, while Amtrak acquired the Rhode Island section in 1976. The line was electrified in 2000; it is now part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, used by high-speed \"Acela Express\" service, intercity \"Northeast Regional\" service, and MBTA Commuter Rail Providence/Stoughton Line local service. The rapid transit MBTA Orange Line shares the right-of-way for several miles in the 1987-built Southwest Corridor section in Boston. The Stoughton Branch is also used for Providence/Stoughton Line service, and the northern section of the Dedham Branch is used by the Needham Line.\n\nThe Boston and Providence Railroad was incorporated June 21, 1831, and chartered the next day to build a railroad between Boston and Providence, Rhode Island.\nConstruction began in late 1832. The first section, from Boston to Canton with a branch to Dedham, opened in 1834, and the rest on July 28, 1835 with the completion of the Canton Viaduct. Stations in Jamaica Plain allowed the development of one of the first commuter suburbs in America.\n\nIn 1887, the railroad's Bussey Bridge collapsed while a morning commuter train was passing over it. The train was carrying about 300 passengers at the time, of which 24 died and 125 were seriously injured. Henry Austin Whitney was the president of the railroad at the time.\n\nUntil 1899, when South Station opened, the Boston terminal was at Park Square, with a crossing at grade of the Boston and Worcester Railroad at the current merge at Back Bay station (also opened in 1899, serving only the B&P). The original Providence terminal was at Fox Point, from which it ran east along the Seekonk River shore and over the river via the India Point Railroad Bridge into East Providence (then part of Seekonk, Massachusetts) before turning north towards Boston. A ferry across the Providence River connected Fox Point to the South Providence terminal of the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (opened 1837). The former mainline became the freight-only East Junction Branch.\n\nIn 1847, the Providence and Worcester Railroad opened between downtown Providence and Worcester, Massachusetts. At the same time, the B&P built a connection west from its main line in southern Attleboro to the P&W in Central Falls. The B&P and P&W jointly owned the line south of Central Falls into downtown Providence. (In 1848, the NYP&B connected its line south of downtown Providence to downtown, removing the gap through Providence.)\n\nOn April 1, 1888, the Old Colony Railroad leased the B&P for 99 years. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the Old Colony on March 1, 1893, and assumed the lease. The New Haven used the B&P as part of its main Boston - New York City \"Shore Line\".\n\nWhen Boston's South Station opened in 1899, a new line was built along the south side of the Boston and Albany Railroad to it, near the B&A's terminal. The old line to Park Square was abandoned.\n\nThe East Side Railroad Tunnel opened in 1908 between the East Side of Providence, Rhode Island and downtown Providence. This provided a second route into Providence, using the old alignment to East Providence and the Crook Point Bascule Bridge over the Seekonk River leading to the tunnel. The tunnel is no longer in use, having been disconnected on the downtown side, with its entrance underneath the What Cheer Building, owned by RISD.\n\nThe Penn Central Transportation Company was created in 1968 through a merger that included the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The Penn Central bankruptcy in the early 1970s coincided with the creation of Amtrak. Penn Central merged the Boston and Providence Railroad into itself in 1972.\n\nThe New Haven's former B&P Boston-New York City main line was included with the former Pennsylvania Railroad's New York City-Washington, D.C. main line as a new high-speed passenger route for Amtrak, the Northeast Corridor. It hosts the \"Acela Express\", the only high-speed rail service in North America.\n\nIn 1973, the MBTA purchased the portion of the B&P main line in Massachusetts, including the Stoughton Branch, forming what is now the Providence/Stoughton Line. The portion in Rhode Island was sold to Amtrak in 1976.\n\nThe first branch was the Dedham Branch to Dedham from Readville, opened in 1834 with the first section of the railroad. The Norfolk County Railroad opened in 1849, continuing from Dedham to the southwest. In 1850, a second branch to Dedham opened from Forest Hills, forming a loop. Another outlet for the Dedham Branch opened in 1906, with a connection west to the New England Railroad at Needham Junction. The Dedham Branch from Forest Hills to that connection is still in use as the Needham Branch of the MBTA Commuter Rail, but the rest of the Dedham loop has been abandoned.\n\nThe Stoughton Branch Railroad was incorporated April 16, 1844 as a branch of the B&P from Canton Junction to Stoughton. It opened in early 1845, and is still in use for passengers as a branch of the main line to Attleboro and Providence.\n\nThe Easton Branch Railroad was incorporated in 1854 and opened in 1855 as a continuation of the Stoughton Branch beyond Stoughton. In 1865, the Old Colony and Newport Railway bought the line and incorporated the majority of it into its main line.\n\nThe Taunton Branch Railroad was incorporated in 1835 to build a branch from the B&P in Mansfield to Taunton, opening in 1836. The branch was operated by the B&P until 1840, when the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad opened, continuing the line past Taunton.\n\nIn 1870, the Mansfield and Framingham Railroad opened, continuing the Taunton Branch northwest on the other side of the B&P. A connection between the Taunton Branch northwest of Taunton and the B&P in Attleboro opened in 1871, built by the Taunton Branch.\n\nThe Attleborough Branch Railroad opened in 1870, running from the B&P in Attleboro northwest to North Attleborough. It was leased to the B&P, and was connected to a branch of the Old Colony Railroad in 1890.\n\nThe Moshassuck Valley Railroad was chartered in 1874 and opened in 1876 as a branch from the joint B&P/P&W at Woodlawn, Rhode Island north to Saylesville. The company remained independent until 1981, when it was bought by the P&W.\n\nThe Seekonk Branch Railroad was a short spur on the east side of the Seekonk River, from the B&P south to a dock on the river. It was incorporated in 1836 and opened soon after, with the hope that it would run its own trains over the B&P, as with a highway. As a result of this, the Massachusetts State Legislature passed a law that a railroad company could refuse any traffic on its road, and the company was a failure. The B&P bought it in 1839, and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad built a line from it in 1855.\n\nThe Providence and Bristol Railroad was incorporated in 1850 and 1851, and reorganized in 1852 as the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad. It opened in 1855 from the old Seekonk Branch in East Providence southeast to Warren and south to Bristol. It was owned by the B&P through a majority of stock, and leased the Old Colony Railroad in 1891.\n\nThe Warren and Fall River Railroad was incorporated in Rhode Island in 1856, and the Fall River and Warren Railroad in Massachusetts in 1857. In 1860 the two were merged to form the Fall River, Warren and Providence Railroad, opening later in 1860 from Warren east to Somerset, across the Taunton River from Fall River. In 1875, the Boston and Providence Railroad Bridge opened, connecting to the Old Colony Railroad in Fall River. At that time, the company was leased by the Old Colony; before that it had been controlled by the B&P.\n\nThis listing includes all stations that have existed along the post-1847 B&P alignment from Park Square, Boston to Providence. Mileage is from Park Square; distances to South Station are 0.8 miles longer. These mileages reflect the pre-realignment routings in Pawtucket and Providence. Some stations were not opened until after the B&P had merged into the Old Colony. Currently open stations are lightlighted.\n\n\n"}

He is the second lieutenant of HMS \"Glatton\", a converted vessel from the British East India Company, fitted with an experimental armament consisting of all short-range, large-caliber carronades.\n\nHMS \"Glatton\" is part of Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet blockading the Batavian Republic.\n\nIn 1797, the year the novel begins, the Royal Navy was beset by two serious mutinies.\n\nThe main grievance of the mutineers were over pay and working conditions. The sailors hadn't received a raise in decades, whereas the soldiers had just received a significant raise. Discipline was harsh and most of the seamen were conscripts.\nUnsurprisingly, Admiral Duncan's fleet was seriously affected.\n\nQuick thinking on the part of the first lieutenant of Delancey's ship prevents the mutiny from taking hold, and the \"Glatton\" is able to join Admiral Duncan's ship, and bluff until the rest of the fleet joins him. But he had to shoot a mutineer to do so.\n\nSince the mutineer's death occurred in port, the first lieutenant has to stay ashore, and Delancey has to assume his duties. He is acting first lieutenant when the Dutch fleet leaves port and is engaged by Admiral Duncan's fleet.\n\nThe Battle of Camperdown is a decisive victory.\nEvery ship's first lieutenant is to be promoted to commander.\nBut Delancey's colleague has been acquitted, and the Captain wants him to receive the promotion, not Delancey. The Captain wants to make sure the trial does not put a black mark against this loyal\nofficer's career — And the first lieutenant, after all had the primary responsibility for training the crew so that their performance was exemplary.\n\nDelancey is bitter, but he does receive command of a fireship. He makes the most of this, by researching the history of fireships. Fire was a very serious danger aboard sailing ships. \nTheir upper works could be bone dry, and very highly flammable materials, like pitch, were used in their construction. Fireships were ships intended to be sailed against enemy fleets at anchor, loaded with incendiaries. Big hooks are hung from her upper works, to entangle with the enemies ship's rigging. When they get close to the enemy fleet, the incendiaries are set alight.\n\nDelancey learns that if his vessel is destroyed while burning an enemy vessel, he can count on promotion.\n\nIt seems a long shot. But a French expedition to stir up sedition in rural Ireland provides him with his opportunity.\n"}

Snodgrass\n\nWilliam De Witt Snodgrass (January 5, 1926 – January 13, 2009) was an American poet who also wrote under the pseudonym S. S. Gardons. He won the 1960 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.\n\nW. D. Snodgrass was born on January 5, 1926, in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, to Bruce De Witt, an accountant, and Jesse Helen (Murchie) Snodgrass. The family lived in Wilkinsburg, but drove to Beaver Falls for his birth since his grandfather was a doctor in the town. Eventually the family moved to Beaver Falls and Snodgrass graduated from the local high school in 1943. He then attended Geneva College until 1944 when he was drafted into the United States Navy. After demobilization in 1946, Snodgrass transferred to the University of Iowa and enrolled in the Iowa Writers' Workshop, originally intending to become a playwright but eventually joining the poetry workshop which was attracting as teachers some of the finest poetic talents of the day, among them John Berryman, Randall Jarrell and Robert Lowell. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949, a Master of Arts degree in 1951, and a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1953.\n\nSnodgrass was known to friends throughout his life as \"De\", pronounced \"dee\", but only published using his initials. He had a long and distinguished academic career, having taught at Cornell (1955-7), Rochester (1957-8), Wayne State (1959–68), Syracuse (1968–1977), Old Dominion (1978-9), and the University of Delaware. He retired from teaching in 1994 to devote himself full-time to his writing. This included autobiographical sketches, essays, and the critical verse \"deconstructions\" of \"De/Construct\". He died in his home in Madison County, New York, aged 83, following a four-month battle with lung cancer, and was survived by his fourth wife, writer Kathleen Snodgrass.\n\nSnodgrass had married his first wife, Lila Jean Hank, in 1946, by whom he had a daughter, Cynthia Jean. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1953 and it was the separation from his daughter as a result that became the subject of his first collection, \"Heart's Needle\". The following year Snodgrass married his second wife, Janice Marie Ferguson Wilson. Together they have a son, Russell Bruce, and a stepdaughter, Kathy Ann Wilson. Divorcing again in 1966, he married his third wife, Camille Rykowski in 1967 but this ended in 1978. His fourth marriage to Kathleen Ann Brown was in 1985.\n\nSnodgrass's first poems appeared in 1951, and throughout the 1950s he published in some of the most prestigious magazines: \"Botteghe Oscure\", \"Partisan Review\", \"The New Yorker\", \"The Paris Review\" and \"The Hudson Review\". However, in 1957, five sections from a sequence entitled \"Heart's Needle\" were included in Hall, Pack and Simpson's anthology, \"New Poets of England and America\", and these were to mark a turning-point. When Lowell had been shown early versions of these poems, in 1953, he had disliked them, but now he was full of admiration.\n\nBy the time \"Heart's Needle\" was published, in 1959, Snodgrass had already won \"The Hudson Review\" Fellowship in Poetry and an Ingram Merrill Foundation Poetry Prize. However, his first book brought him more: a citation from the Poetry Society of America, a grant from the National Institute of Arts, and, most important of all, 1960's Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. It is often said that \"Heart's Needle\" inaugurated confessional poetry. Snodgrass disliked the term. The genre he was reviving here seemed revolutionary to most of his contemporaries, reared as they had been on the anti-expressionistic principles of the New Critics. Snodgrass's confessional work was to have a profound effect on many of his contemporaries, amongst them, most importantly, Robert Lowell.\n\nBeing tagged with this label affected his work and its reception and forced him into small-press publication for many years. Two new themes (eventually) restored his reputation, although at the time they first began to appear there was a perception by some that Snodgrass had \"wrecked his career\". One was \"The Führer Bunker\" cycle of poems, monologues by Adolf Hitler and his circle in the closing days of the Third Reich, a \"poem in progress\" that began to appear from 1977 onwards and was finally completed in 1995. An adaptation of these for the stage was performed in the 1980s. The other theme was the series written in response to DeLoss McGraw's surrealistic paintings, which eventually grew into a partnership. In these poems, often uproariously rhymed, Snodgrass stood his former confessional style on its head at the same time as satirizing contemporary attitudes.\n\nPoetry\n\nProse\n\nDrama\n\nAnthologies\n\n\n"}

It is a summer residence for many but there are some year round residents. There are many small cabins most of which were rebuilt after the Aspen Fire of July 2003.\n\nAt the peak is the Mount Lemmon Observatory, which was formerly the site of a USAF radar base of the Air Defense Command, and the building that formerly housed a military emergency radar tracking station for landing the Space Shuttle at White Sands Missile Range. Although the United States military had a presence on the mountain for several decades all their facilities have been abandoned and were given to the United States Forest Service. The area and buildings that makes up the Mount Lemmon Station Observatory are leased from the Forest Service by the University of Arizona. The telescopes on the mountain are still used for astronomical research today by organizations such as the Catalina Sky Survey, the Mount Lemmon Sky Center, the University of Arizona Astronomy Camp program, the University of Arizona, and the University of Minnesota.

{"id": "1975933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975933", "title": "Ugetsu", "text": "Ugetsu\n\n, is a 1953 Japanese romantic fantasy drama film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi and based on stories in Ueda Akinari's 1776 book of the same name. It is a ghost story and an example of the \"jidaigeki\" (period drama) genre, starring Masayuki Mori and Machiko Kyō.\n\nDrawing its plot particularly from Ueda's tales \"The House in the Thicket\" and \"The Lust of the White Serpent\", the film is set in Azuchi–Momoyama period Japan (c. 1573–1600). It is about a peasant farmer and potter who leaves his wife and young son during civil war, and is seduced by a spirit that threatens his life. A subplot involves his friend, who dreams of becoming a great samurai and chases this goal at the unintended expense of his wife.\n\nMajor themes include the ethics of war, forbidden relationships with the spirit world, and neglect of family duty. The film won the Silver Lion Award at the 1953 Venice Film Festival and other honours. \"Ugetsu\" is one of Mizoguchi's most celebrated films, regarded by critics as a masterpiece of Japanese cinema. It is credited with simultaneously helping to popularise Japanese cinema in the West and influencing later Japanese film.\n\nIn the farming village Nakanogō, on the shore of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province in the Sengoku period, Genjūrō, a potter, takes his wares to nearby Ōmizo. He is accompanied by Tōbei, who dreams of becoming a samurai. A respected sage tells Genjūrō's wife Miyagi to warn her husband about seeking profit in times of upheaval, and to prepare for a probable attack on the village. Genjūrō arrives with wide profits, but she asks him to stop. Genjūrō nevertheless works long hours to finish his pottery. That night, Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through Nakanogō, and Genjūrō, Tōbei and their wives are uprooted. Genjūrō collects his pottery from the kiln, and decides to take the pots to a different marketplace. As the two couples travel across a lake, a boat appears from thick fog. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them back to their homes, then dies. The two men decide to return their wives to the shore. Tōbei's wife Ohama refuses to go. Miyagi begs Genjūrō not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son, Gen'ichi, clasped to her back. At market, Genjūrō's pottery sells well. After taking his promised share of the profits, Tōbei runs off to buy samurai armor, and sneaks into the ranks of a clan of samurai. Lost from her companions, Ohama has wandered beyond Nagahama in her desperate search for Tōbei. She is raped by a group of soldiers.\n\nGenjūrō is visited by a noblewoman and her female servant, who order several pieces of pottery and tell him to take them to the Kutsuki mansion. Genjūrō learns that Nobunaga's soldiers have attacked the manor and killed all who lived there, except Lady Wakasa and her servant. He also learns that Lady Wakasa's father haunts the manor. Genjūrō is seduced by Lady Wakasa, and she convinces him to marry her. Meanwhile, Nakanogō is under attack. Miyagi and her son hide from soldiers and are found by an elderly woman who hurries them to safety. In the woods, several soldiers desperately search her for food. She fights with the soldiers and is stabbed. She collapses with her son still clutching her back.\nTōbei steals the severed head of a general, which he presents to the commander of the victorious side. He is rewarded with armor, a mount, and a retinue. Tōbei later rides into the marketplace on his new horse, eager to return home to show his wife. However, he visits a brothel and finds her working there as a prostitute. Tōbei promises to buy back her honor. Later, the two return to Nakanogō, Tōbei throwing his armor into a river along the way.\n\nGenjūrō meets a priest, who tells him to return to his loved ones or certain death awaits him. When Genjūrō mentions the noblewoman, the priest reveals that the noblewoman is dead and must be exorcised, and then invites Genjūrō to his home where he paints Buddhist prayers on his body. Genjūrō returns to the Kutsuki mansion. He admits that he is married, has a child and wishes to return home. Lady Wakasa will not let him go. She and her servant admit they are spirits, returned to this world so that Lady Wakasa, who was slain before she knew love, could experience its joys. They tell him to wash away the Buddhist symbols. Genjūrō reaches for a sword, throws himself out of the manor, and passes out. The next day, he is awakened by soldiers. They accuse him of stealing the sword, but he denies it, saying it is from the Kutsuki mansion. The soldiers laugh at him, saying the Kutsuki mansion was burned down over a month ago. Genjūrō arises and finds the mansion he has lived in is nothing more than a pile of burnt wood. The soldiers confiscate his money, but because Shibata's army burned down the prison, they leave Genjūrō in the rubble. He returns home by foot, searching for his wife.\n\nMiyagi, delighted to see him, will not let him tell of his terrible mistake. Genjūrō holds his sleeping son in his arms, and eventually lies down to sleep. The next morning, Genjūrō wakes to the village chief knocking on his door. He is surprised to see Genjūrō home, and expresses concern. He explains that he has been caring for Genjūrō's son, and that the boy must have come to his old home in the middle of the night. Genjūrō calls for Miyagi. The neighbor asks if Genjūrō is dreaming, as his wife is dead. Miyagi's spirit tells Genjūrō: \"I am always with you\", while he continues on pottery, and their son offers food to her.\n\nAfter the success of his previous film \"The Life of Oharu\" (1952), Mizoguchi was offered to make a film by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios. The deal promised Mizoguchi complete artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually pressured to make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's screenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture the sensations and lucidity of Ueda's book \"Ugetsu Monogatari\".\n\nMizoguchi based his film on two stories from Ueda's book, \"The House in the Thicket\" (Asaji ga Yado) and \"The Lust of the White Serpent\" (Jasei no In). \"The Lust of the White Serpent\" is about a demon who appears as a princess and attempts to seduce a man. It was the basis of the plot in which Lady Wakasa seduces Genjūrō. \"The House in the Thicket\" gave the film its ending, in which the protagonist returns home after a long absence, only to meet the spirit of his lost wife. The film is set in the 16th century, though \"The House in the Thicket\" is set in the 15th century and \"The Lust of the White Serpent\" is set in an earlier time frame. Other inspirations for the film's script include Guy de Maupassant's \"Décoré!\" (\"How He Got the Legion of Honour\"). This story provided a basis for Tōbei's subplot. In the short story, the protagonist receives the French Legion of Honour by ignoring his wife's adultery with a member of the Legion. Similarly, Tōbei becomes a samurai while his wife becomes a prostitute.\n\nDespite initial intentions, as the film developed, Yoda said anti-war messages, particularly about how war makes women suffer, kept surfacing and soon became the most prominent theme. While writing the script, Mizoguchi told Yoda \"Whether war originates in the ruler's personal motives, or in some public concern, how violence, disguised as war, oppresses and torments the populace both physically and spiritually ... I want to emphasise this as the main theme of the film\". During the shooting Yoda was constantly rewriting and revising scenes due to Mizoguchi's perfectionism.\n\nThe film was Machiko Kyō's second collaboration with Mizoguchi, as she had a small role in \"The Three Danjuros\" (1944). She had collaborated much more frequently with Masayuki Mori. As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period and her face was designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre. As such, her eyebrows were styled using a practice known as \"hikimayu\".\n\nKinuyo Tanaka, who played Miyagi, found the scene where she is a ghost to be the most stressful, as she had to play a ghost and appear to be an actual wife at the same time. After rehearsals and the shooting, Mizoguchi lit a cigarette for Mori, indicating his rare degree of satisfaction with the scene. Eitaro Ozawa, who played Tōbei, said the actors frequently rehearsed alone, or with the cinematographer, while Mizoguchi was willingly absent during these preparations.\n\nMizoguchi told his cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa that he wanted the film \"to unroll seamlessly like a scroll-painting\". The Southern School of Chinese painting was particularly an inspiration the filmmakers aspired to. The film has been praised for its cinematography, such as the opening shot and the scene where Genjūrō and Lady Wakasa have sex by a stream and the camera follows the flow of the water instead of lingering on the two lovers. Mizoguchi never personally handled the camera and did not participate in planning the lighting of his film. To achieve the appearance the filmmakers wanted, Miyagawa kept lighting low and filmed as near to sunset as circumstances would allow. Many of the shots were taken from cranes, with Miyagawa claiming in 1992 that these shots made up 70% of the film. Miyagawa also stated that this film was the only occasion in which Mizoguchi complimented him for his camera work.\n\nThe set depicting Kutsuki Manor was based on the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. These sets are decorated with props evocative of feudal-era aristocrats, such as kimono and armor, personally chosen by Mizoguchi. The scene where the protagonists travel through Lake Biwa on a boat was in fact shot on a pool in the studio, with added smoke. The assistant directors had to push the boat through the cold waters. Miyagawa identified this as one of the scenes shot from a crane.\n\nFor the film score, Mizoguchi relied on composer Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, and was not involved in their creative process. Fumio Hayasaka was a strong proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films, though he incorporated several elements of Western music as well. For \"Ugetsu\", he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichirō Saitō and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music reflective of the period.\n\nThe score employs drums, flutes and chanting. The film's sounds also include bells heard in improbable places.\n\nAccording to Professor Martha P. Nochimson, a common interpretation of the film is that Mizoguchi refashioned the stories of \"Ugetsu Monogatari\" to express regret about the pro-war extremism leading to World War II, with Mizoguchi personally having made the pro-war propaganda film \"The 47 Ronin\" in 1941. These reflections on militarism, greed and arrogance connected with audiences not only in Japan but around the world in the wake of the war. The subplot of Tōbei and Ohama particularly reflects the comfort women, who were made into prostitutes by the Imperial Japanese Army. Mizoguchi struggled with Daiei to give the subplot an unhappier ending than what appears in the film, in line with real comfort women's experiences after the war. Tōbei's subplot reveals the mistake of war can also be a \"tragicomedy\".\n\nAccording to British critic Tony Rayns the film's presentation of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture. In his relationship with Wakasa, Genjūrō is insignificant and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend. However, by neglecting his family, Genjūrō failed to appreciate he has already been blessed with a good life, and in the process, loses it.\n\nAs a ghost story, the film delves into a relationship between a spirit and a living person, which runs contrary to nature and will lead to the death of the person. Although ghosts are not mentioned in the initial parts of the film, Japanese writer Kazushi Hosaka stated Mizoguchi foreshadowed it using the scenery, which suggests a detachment from real life. The scene where the protagonists cross Lake Biwa is an example, given the fogs that turn the film away from the \"jidaigeki\" genre. Professor Robin Wood argues that the film's depiction of the main ghost character evolves from the mere demon of \"The Lust of the White Serpent\" into the more humane and tragic Lady Wakasa, and this makes the story more complex. Wood further opines the combination of the story with \"The House in the Thicket,\" combining the male protagonist of each tale into one character, Genjūrō, also connects the demon character and the ghost wife. Both Lady Wakasa and Miyagi are killed by a male-dominated society, and both are wronged by Genjūrō. Wood believes \"Ugetsu\" can be considered a feminist film for its exploration of the negative impact of a patriarchy.\n\nGenjūrō's pottery is also a major theme in the film. Professor Wood argues his pottery evolves in three phases, reflecting Mizoguchi's changing approach to filmmaking. Genjūrō begins making the pottery for commercial reasons, shifts to pure aesthetics while isolated with Lady Wakasa, and finally moves on to a style that reflects life and strives to understand it.\n\n\"Ugetsu\" was released in Japan on 26 March 1953. It was shown at the 1953 Venice Film Festival. Accompanied by Yoda and Kinuyo Tanaka, Mizoguchi made his first trip outside Japan to attend the festival. He spent most of his time in Italy inside his hotel room praying to a scroll with a portrait of Nichiren. While in Venice he met director William Wyler, whose film \"Roman Holiday\" was also screening in competition at the festival and was rumoured to be the winner of the Silver Lion for best director. The film opened in New York City on 7 September 1954, with the English title \"Ugetsu\" being a truncation of \"Ugetsu Monogatari\", the Japanese title, from Ueda's book. It was distributed elsewhere in the United States by Harrison Pictures under the title \"Tales of Ugetsu\" on 20 September 1954.\n\nIn September 2006, Film Forum screened the film in New York City over six days, opening a Mizoguchi tribute. A 4K digital restoration also screened as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna, and the 54th New York Film Festival. The restoration \"was undertaken by The Film Foundation and Kadokawa Corporation at Cineric Laboratories in New York\".\n\n\"Ugetsu\" was released on VHS by Home Vision Entertainment, with English subtitles. On 8 November 2005, the film became available for the first time on Region 1 DVD when the Criterion Collection released a two-disc edition of the film, which includes numerous special features such as a 150-minute documentary on Mizoguchi, \"\", directed by Kaneto Shindo. The box-set also includes a booklet with an essay by Keiko I. McDonald, the author of \"Mizoguchi\" and editor of \"Ugetsu\", and the three short stories from which the film draws inspiration. The film was released on Blu-Ray through the Criterion Collection years later, with all the features included.\n\nIn April 2008, \"Ugetsu Monogatari\" was released in the U.K. on Region 2 DVD by Eureka Entertainment as part of their Masters of Cinema series. The two-disc special edition containing new transfers is released in a double pack which twins it with Mizoguchi's film \"Miss Oyu\" (1951). This U.K. set was released on Blu-ray on 23 April 2012.\n\n\"Ugetsu\" is often regarded as a masterwork of Japanese cinema and a definitive piece during Japan's Golden Age of Film. It is one of a number of films arguably more popular in western countries than in Japan. Japanese film historian Tadao Satō remarked that while this film, along with Mizoguchi's other works of the period \"The Crucified Lovers\" and \"Sansho the Bailiff\", was probably not meant specifically to be sold to westerners as an \"exotic\" piece, it was perceived by studio executives as the kind of film that would not necessarily make a profit in Japanese theaters but would win awards at international film festivals.\n\nThe film was immediately popular in western countries and praised by such film critics as Lindsay Anderson and Donald Richie. Richie called it \"one of the most perfect movies in the history of Japanese cinema\" and especially praised the beauty and morality of the film's opening and closing shots. Richie analyzed how the film starts with \"a long panorama\" and shots spanning from a lake to the shore and the village. He judged the ending's \"upward tilting panorama\" from the grave to above to reflect the beginning. Bosley Crowther, in \"The New York Times\", wrote that the film had \"a strangely obscure, inferential, almost studiedly perplexing quality\". \"Variety\" staff praised the film's visuals for reminiscence to Japanese prints, costumes and set design, and the performances of Masayuki Mori and Machiko Kyō.\n\nThe film appeared in \"Sight & Sound\" magazine's top 10 critics poll of the greatest films ever made, which is held once every decade, in 1962 and 1972. \"Ugetsu\" currently holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 26 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.45/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"With its thought-provoking themes, rich atmosphere, and brilliant direction, Kenji Mizoguchi's is a towering classic of world cinema\". Roger Ebert added \"Ugetsu\" to his Great Movies list in 2004, calling it \"one of the greatest of all films\", and said that \"At the end of \"Ugetsu\", aware we have seen a fable, we also feel curiously as if we have witnessed true lives and fates\". Director Martin Scorsese has also listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In \"5001 Nights at the Movies\", film critic Pauline Kael found it to be \"subtle, violent yet magical\", and termed \"Ugetsu\" as \"one of the most amazing of the Japanese movies that played American art houses\". In 2000, \"The Village Voice\" newspaper ranked \"Ugetsu\" 29th on their list of the 100 best films of the 20th century.\n\n\"Ugetsu\" won the Silver Lion Award for Best Direction at the Venice Film Festival in 1953. The night before, Mizoguchi, believing that if the film did not win an award the shame would prevent him from returning to Japan, stayed in his hotel room and prayed. In Japan it was named third in Kinema Junpo's Best Ten for Japanese films of 1953. and won two awards at the 8th Mainichi Film Awards.\n\nAlong with Akira Kurosawa's film \"Rashomon\" (1950), \"Ugetsu\" is credited with having popularised Japanese cinema in the West. The film, and Yasujirō Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\", released the same year, particularly created awareness of other Japanese filmmakers. Mizoguchi cemented his reputation among film aficionados in Europe with his film \"Sansho the Bailiff\" (1954). \"Ugetsu\" and \"Sansho the Bailiff\" made an impact on French New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, and U.S. director Paul Schrader, who sought Kazuo Miyagawa for advice on the film \"\" (1985).\n\n\n\n"}

Following the \"Great Disappointment\" Wendell experienced periods of weak faith, as did many Adventists. He eventually recovered his faith after renewing his study of Bible chronology (historic and prophetic) and began to preach extensively throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Virginias, and New England By the late 1860s he had been studying the chronology of the Bible, and was encouraged by conclusions showing Christ's return would occur in either 1868 or 1873/4. In 1870 Wendell published his views in the booklet entitled \"The Present Truth, or Meat in Due Season\" concluding that the Second Advent was sure to occur in 1873. Unknown to him, attendance at one of his presentations restored Charles Taze Russell's faith in the Bible as the true word of God, leading to Russell's ministry.\n\nIn 1871 the Associated Press circulated a story that Wendell had been arrested in Pennsylvania on the charge of \"improper intimacy\" with a 16-year-old girl. No evidence of impropriety was ever produced, and Wendell publicly denied not only the charges, but that he had ever been arrested.\n\nThe magazine \"The World's Crisis\" in the September 10, 1873 issue offered an obituary written by fellow Adventist and personal friend, George Stetson. A brief summary appears below:\n\nIn Memory of Elder Jonas Wendell\n\n\"He was born December 25, 1815, and fell asleep August 14 1873. Age fifty seven years, seven months, and fourteen days. ...\n\n\"He had settled on 1873 as the year in which \"the hope of seeing Jesus and being made like him\" should be realized by a waiting and expectant church, and set forth the reasons for his hope in a little work entitled, \"Present truth,\" or \"Meat in Due Season,\" ...\n\n\"... on Wednesday evening, 13 August, by request, in absence of the pastor, he led the prayer and conference meeting, and much edified all present by his unusual fervency in prayer, exhortation, and singing. \"What a friend we have in Jesus\" was the last hymn he ever sung with us. On Thursday the 14th, he went to the Sabbath School picnic in most excellent spirits, and seemed to be very happy in the Lord. When time for adjournment arrived, he got out his horse to return home, but seeing a lad in trouble from a fickly horse, he went to his assistance, where he overtaxed his physical strength, and returned to his own buggy quite exhausted. But he got in and took the lines from his niece, to start home, but immediately loosened his hold, dropped them, and fell over backward in his seat, dead. He gave but two slight gasps for breath, and all was over...\n\n\"On Saturday, 16 August, at 2 P.M. his funeral was numerously attended at our chapel, when all the clergy of our village came to observe his obsequies, sympathize with his bereaved family, and participate in the services of the occasion... Medical opinion is divided between apoplexy and heart disease as cause of death.\n\n"}

It was produced and directed by William Wyler and based on a novel and a play of the same name, written by Joseph Hayes, which were loosely built on actual events.\n\nThe original Broadway production had actor Paul Newman in the Bogart role but he was passed over for the movie because Bogart was a much bigger star. The character was made older in the script so Bogart could play the part. Bogart said he viewed the story as \"Duke Mantee grown up,\" Mantee having been Bogart's breakthrough movie role in \"The Petrified Forest\". Spencer Tracy was originally cast in the film with Bogart. Although the two actors were very good friends, both insisted on top billing, and Tracy eventually withdrew from the picture. Fredric March assumed Tracy's role as Daniel Hilliard . The role of Glenn Griffin was Bogart's last as a villain.\n\n\"The Desperate Hours\" was the first black-and-white film in VistaVision, Paramount's wide-screen process. The house used in the final seasons of the television series \"Leave It to Beaver\" was used for exterior shots of the Hilliards' home. In 1956, Joseph Hayes won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay.\n\nGlenn Griffin (Humphrey Bogart) is the leader of a trio of escaped convicts who invade the Hilliards' suburban home in Indianapolis and hold the four family members hostage. There they await the arrival of a package, being sent by Griffin's girlfriend, that contains funds to aid the three fugitives in their escape.\n\nPolice organize a statewide manhunt for the escapees and eventually discover the distraught family's plight. Griffin menaces and torments the Hilliards and threatens to kill them. Later, the refuse collector, George Patterson (Walter Baldwin), who happens upon the situation after noticing Griffin's car in the garage, is silenced by murder, after being forced to drive into the country.\n\nFinally, after convincing law enforcement personnel that their plan to storm the residence is too risky for his family, the father, Daniel Hilliard (Fredric March), plays a trick on Griffin using an unloaded handgun. Then, he forces the convict out of the house with the outlaw's own weapon trained on him. Griffin is subsequently machine-gunned to death when he hurls the firearm at a police spotlight and makes a break for it.\n\n\nActual events that took place on September 11 and 12 in 1952, wherein the five members of the Hill family were held hostage for 19 hours, inspired the 1954 Joseph Hayes novel which, in turn, inspired the 1955 play on which the movie was based. The Hill family (formerly of Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania) sued Time, Inc., because \"Life\" magazine published an article in the February 1955 issue about the play, describing it as based on the actual events. The article was illustrated by staged photos with actors in the actual home that was the scene of the events, the Hills having moved away, making efforts to discourage publicity. The Hills' complaint was that the article falsely described the actual events while claiming it represented the truth. Immediately following the home invasion event, Mr. Hill had told the press the family had not been molested or harmed, and in fact had been treated courteously. The \"Life\" article, however, stated that some family members had been assaulted, profanity used, and in other ways – according to a New York appellate court – differed from the account Hill had given. Suing in a New York court, the plaintiffs relied on a New York statute which permitted damages suits for violation of the right of privacy only in instances of use of a person's name or picture for commercial purposes without consent. The statute, however, had been interpreted by the New York courts to make the truth of the publication a defense. The defense for Time, Inc., was that the matter was of general interest and the article had been published in good faith. A jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages, but the state appellate court awarded a new trial at which only compensatory damages could be considered, while sustaining liability. This order was affirmed by the highest state court.\n\nTime, Inc., appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that the First Amendment prohibited holding the publisher liable unless the article was known by it to be false, or at least was published with disregard as to its truth or falsity (i.e., recklessly). The jury had not been so instructed, so the judgment could not stand. This ruling was a significant expansion of press protection, for a (qualified) immunity from damages was being extended to publishing matter about people who were newsworthy only by accident, as opposed to, for example, government officials. To this point the relevant cases had only dealt with such so-called \"public figures\" who were suing publishers. Mr. Hill was represented in the High Court by Richard M. Nixon, at that time an attorney in private practice. The Supreme Court thus made it extremely difficult even for ordinarily private persons to prevail in a defamation or \"false light\" invasion of privacy case. From the Supreme Court, the case was sent back in 1967, to the New York courts for disposition under this newly announced constitutional standard, probably involving a new trial, or perhaps summary judgment rendered on the basis of affidavits and depositions.\n\nThe movie was remade in 1990 as \"Desperate Hours\", starring Mickey Rourke, Anthony Hopkins, Mimi Rogers, Kelly Lynch, Lindsay Crouse and David Morse. The remake, directed by Michael Cimino, received poor reviews.\n\nThe film was also remade in India as the Hindi film \"36 Ghante\" (1974).\n\n\n"}

Internally known as the Porsche Type 64 this car would feature an aluminium streamlined body, a 1.5L version of the Volkswagen's original 1.0L engine, and a top speed of at least 160 km/h (100 mph). Originally the car was to use a large number of VW parts, but due to the intricacies of then German law it was not legal to sell government made parts to a private company.\n\nBy 1938 Ferdinand had given up trying to arrange for a supply of VW parts for the Type 64. Ferdinand and his son Ferry Porsche decided to redesign the car from the ground up to be built internally by Porsche. This would have been the first car actually built by Porsche themselves. Known as the Type 114, or F-Wagen, a sort of portmanteau of Ferry and P-Wagen, it was a significant departure from the Type 64. Although it never reached the prototype stage the design drawings were all but completed and included a novel water cooled 72 BHP V10 twin camshaft engine in a true mid engine layout, as opposed to the VW's rear engine layout. Suspension was by trailing arms in front and swing axles in the rear, with drum brakes at all four corners. The body was aluminum and resembled a lower, stretched, and streamlined VW. Porsche had hopes of producing this car, but international tensions and a poor economy lead to its cancellation. Porsche did manage to salvage part of its investment by selling the transaxle design to Volkswagen.\n\nThe Porsche Type 114 never came to be, but it lived on in a number of Porsche cars. After World War II Ferry Porsche began to build sports cars based on the VW, and eventually began production of the Porsche 356 which in concept was identical to the Type 64. Also aerodynamic research for the 114 led to a series of bodies produced by Porsche for racing and land speed record cars, such as the Type 60K10, a highly modified VW Beetle. While the type 114 was in the end little more than a design study it had a large impact on the future course of Porsche and the cars that would make the company a dominant force in the automotive world.\n\n"}

An \"object\" may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged \"objects\".\n\nThe term \"electric potential energy\" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-variant electric fields, while the term \"electrostatic potential energy\" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-invariant electric fields.\n\nThe electric potential energy of a system of point charges is defined as the work required assembling this system of charges by bringing them close together, as in the system from an infinite distance.\n\n^\\mathbf{r} q\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r'}) \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{r'}</math>,\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy can also be defined from the electric potential as follows:\n\nThe SI unit of electric potential energy is the joule (named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule). In the CGS system the erg is the unit of energy, being equal to 10 J. Also electronvolts may be used, 1 eV = 1.602×10 J.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy, \"U\", of one point charge \"q\" at position r in the presence of a point charge \"Q\", taking an infinite separation between the charges as the reference position, is:\n\nwhere formula_3 is Coulomb's constant, \"r\" is the distance between the point charges \"q\" & \"Q\", and \"q\" & \"Q\" are the charges (not the absolute values of the charges—i.e., an electron would have a negative value of charge when placed in the formula). The following outline of proof states the derivation from the definition of electric potential energy and Coulomb's law to this formula.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy, \"U\", of one point charge \"q\" in the presence of \"n\" point charges \"Q\", taking an infinite separation between the charges as the reference position, is:\n\nwhere formula_3 is Coulomb's constant, \"r\" is the distance between the point charges \"q\" & \"Q\", and \"q\" & \"Q\" are the signed values of the charges.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy \"U\" stored in a system of \"N\" charges \"q\", \"q\", ..., \"q\" at positions r, r, ..., r respectively, is:\n\nwhere, for each \"i\" value, Φ(r) is the electrostatic potential due to all point charges except the one at r, and is equal to:\n\nformula_5,\n\nwhere \"r\" is the distance between q and q.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy of a system containing only one point charge is zero, as there are no other sources of electrostatic force against which an external agent must do work in moving the point charge from infinity to its final location.\n\nA common question arises concerning the interaction of a point charge with its own electrostatic potential. Since this interaction doesn't act to move the point charge itself, it doesn't contribute to the stored energy of the system.\n\nConsider bringing a point charge, \"q\", into its final position near a point charge, \"Q\". The electrostatic potential Φ(r) due to \"Q\" is\n\nHence we obtain, the electric potential energy of \"q\" in the potential of \"Q\" as\n\nwhere r is the separation between the two point charges.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy of a system of three charges should not be confused with the electrostatic potential energy of \"Q\" due to two charges \"Q\" and \"Q\", because the latter doesn't include the electrostatic potential energy of the system of the two charges \"Q\" and \"Q\".\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy stored in the system of three charges is:\n\nThe energy density, or energy per unit volume, formula_9, of the electrostatic field of a continuous charge distribution is:\n\nSome elements in a circuit can convert energy from one form to another. For example, a resistor converts electrical energy to heat. This is known as the Joule effect. A capacitor stores it in its electric field. The total electric potential energy stored in a capacitor is given by\n\nwhere \"C\" is the capacitance, \"V\" is the electric potential difference, and \"Q\" the charge stored in the capacitor.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy may also be expressed in terms of the electric field in the form\n\nwhere formula_13 is the electric displacement field within a dielectric material and integration is over the entire volume of the dielectric.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy stored within a charged dielectric may also be expressed in terms of a continuous volume charge, formula_14,\n\nwhere integration is over the entire volume of the dielectric.\n\nThese latter two expressions are valid only for cases when the smallest increment of charge is zero (formula_16) such as dielectrics in the presence of metallic electrodes or dielectrics containing many charges.\n"}
{"id": "1975957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975957", "title": "Cossack Hetmanate", "text": "Cossack Hetmanate\n\nThe Cossack Hetmanate (, '), officially known as the Zaporizhian Host (, ', ), was a Cossack state in the region of Central Ukraine between 1648 and 1764 (or until 1782 according to some sources).\n\nThe Hetmanate was founded by the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the Uprising of 1648–57. Establishment of vassal relations with the Tsardom of Russia in the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654 is considered a benchmark of the Cossack Hetmanate in Soviet, Ukrainian, and Russian historiography. The second Pereyaslav Council in 1659 further restricted the independence of the Hetmanate, and from the Moscow side there were attempts to declare agreements reached with Yuri Khmelnitsky in 1659 as nothing more than the \"former Bohdan's agreements\" of 1654. The 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo – conducted without any representation from the Cossack Hetmanate – established borders between the Polish and Russian states, dividing the Hetmanate in half along the Dnieper and putting the Zaporizhian Sich under a formal joint Russian-Polish administration.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to break the union with Russia by Ivan Mazepa in 1708, the whole area was included into the Government of Kiev and Cossack autonomy was severely restricted. Catherine II of Russia officially abolished the institute of the Hetman in 1764, and in 1764-1781 the Cossack Hetmanate was incorporated as the Little Russia Governorate headed by Pyotr Rumyantsev, with the last remnants of the Hetmanate's administrative system abolished in 1781.\n\nThe official name of the Cossack Hetmanate was Zaporizhian Host (, '). The historiographic term Hetmanate (, ', \"Hetman state\") was coined in the late 19th century, deriving from the word \"hetman\", the title of the general of the Zaporizhian Army. \"Zaporizhian Host\" means an \"army of the Zaporizhia\", where the Zaporizhia (meaning \"beyond the rapids\" in Ukrainian) is a historical and geographic region in Southern Ukraine centered at the Zaporizhian Sich as well as a general name of Ukrainian Cossacks as a political and military organization. Inhabitants of the Cossack Hetmanate referred to the place in Ukrainian as \"Ukraine\" or \"Vkraine\".\n\nIn Muscovite diplomatic correspondence it was called the Little Russia (, '); in Polish, Ottoman, and Arab sources as Ukraine or Cossakia. The Cossack Hetmanate was called the country of Ukraine (') by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe founder of the Hetmanate, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, declared himself as the ruler of the Ruthenian state (or Rus state) to the Polish representative Adam Kysil in February 1649. His contemporary Metropolitan Sylvestr Kosiv recognized him as \"the leader and the commander of our land\". In his letter to Constantin Șerban (1657) he referred to himself as \"\".\n\nAfter many successful military campaigns against the Poles, Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky made a triumphant entry into Kiev on Christmas 1648 where he was hailed liberator of the people from Polish captivity. In February 1649, during negotiations in Pereiaslav with a Polish delegation, Khmelnytsky had made it clear to the Poles that he wanted to be the Hetman of Ruthenia that could stretch all the way to Chelm and Halych, and build with the Tatar's help. He warned them about his intention to resume his military campaign.\n\nWhen the returned delegation informed John II Casimir of Khmelnytsky's new campaign the king called for all szlachta volunteer army, while sending the regular troops against cossacks to southern Volhynia. However, after obtaining an intelligence report of the superior cossack forces, the Polish troops retreated to Zbarazh to set a defense. The forces of Jeremi Wiśniowiecki reinforced the Zbarazh defenders while he took the lead of all Polish forces. Khmelnytsky besieged the city wearing down through series of random attacks and firing at it. The king while rushing to help Wiśniowiecki was ambushed with his newly gathered forces. Khmelnytsky leaving part of his army with Ivan Cherniata near Zbarazh moved together with İslâm III Giray to intercept the Polish reinforcements and block their way at a river crossing near Zboriv. Caught by some degree of surprise, John Casimir started negotiations with the Tatar's khan. With the khan on his side, they forced Khmelnytsky to start peace negotiations. Khmelnytsky signed the Treaty of Zboriv in August 1649, with a result somewhat less than the Cossack leader had anticipated from his campaign.\n\nAs ruler of the Hetmanate, Khmelnytsky engaged in state-building across multiple spheres: in the military, administration, finance, economics, and culture. He invested the Zaporozhian Host under the leadership of its hetman with supreme power in the new Ruthenian state, and he unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. This would involve building a government system and a developed military and civilian administration out of Cossack officers and Ruthenian nobles, as well as the establishment of an elite within the Cossack Hetman state.\n\nThe Hetmanate used Polish currency, and Polish as an administrative language and a language of command. However, after the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667, the \"simple language\" (), or the commonly spoken vernacular language of Ukraine, began to be written down and widely used in official documents of the Cossack Hetmanate.\n\nAfter the Crimean Tatars betrayed the Cossacks for the third time in 1653, Khmelnytsky realized he could no longer rely on Ottoman support against Poland, and he was forced to turn to Tsardom of Russia for help. Final attempts to negotiate took place in January 1654 in the town of Pereyaslav between Khmelnytsky with Cossack leaders and the ambassador from Tsar, Vasiliy Buturlin. The treaty was concluded in April in Moscow by the Cossacks Samiilo Bohdanovych-Zarudny and Pavlo Teteria, and by Aleksey Trubetskoy, Vasilii Buturlin, and other Moscow boyars. As a result of the treaty, the Zaporozhian Host got an autonomous status of the Hetmanate within the Russian state. The treaty also led to the Russo-Polish War of 1654–1667.\n\nThe period of Hetmanate history known as \"the Ruin,\" lasting from 1657 to 1687, was marked by constant civil wars throughout the state. After Bohdan Khmelnytsky died in 1657, his sixteen-year-old son Yurii Khmelnytsky was elected as successor. However, the son was not only too young and inexperienced, but also clearly lacked the charisma and leadership qualities of his father.\n\nIn response, Ivan Vyhovsky, the general scribe (\"pysar\") of the Hetmanate and an adviser to Bohdan Khmelnytsky was elected hetman in 1657 by the Starshyna council. His election caused widespread discontent among other regiments and the Zaporizhian Host, who sent their runners to Moscow with complaints. As a result, new elections were called that same year at which Vyhovsky was reelected at the General Military Council. This election was also confirmed by Moscow's authorities who were informed according to the Pereyaslav treaty. Moscow continued to accept runners from the regions of Cossack Hetmanate completely disregarding the authority of hetman and spreading rumors that in truth Moscow did not support the candidacy of Vyhovsky. Vyhovsky, seeing the situation turning out of his control, went on to extinguish the revolt led by the Zaporozhian Kosh Otaman Yakiv Barabash and Poltava Colonel Martyn Pushkar. In the spring of 1658 Vyhovsky crossed Dnieper and confronted mutineers near Poltava with the help of Tatars. During the battle Pushkar was killed and replaced with a new colonel, while the leaders of the uprising were strictly repressed.\n\nAfter this, Vyhovsky and the General Starshyna considered the relationship with Muscovy to be broken. The newly elected Metropolitan Dionisi Balaban was transferred to Chyhyryn away from Kiev. An agitation against Moscow was conducted where the Ukrainian government informed the population of possible national repressions, similar to those being conducted in the neighboring lands of Belarus that were recently secured by Muscovy in its conflict with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. A manifest nullifying the union with Moscow was sent throughout Europe, mainly because it was conducting friendly relationships with Poland and supporting internal opposition within the Hetmanate. Negotiations with Sweden had frozen, while he had military support from the Crimean Khanate, so Vyhovsky decided to renegotiate with Poland, with whom talks continued for quite some time.\n\nOn September 16, 1658 in Hadyach, an official document was signed between representatives of the Cossack Hetmanate and Poland. Under the conditions of the treaty, Ukraine would become a third and autonomous component of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, under the ultimate sovereignty of the King of Poland but with its own military, courts, and treasury. But the treaty, although ratified by the Diet in May 1659, was never implemented because it was unpopular among the lower classes of the Ruthenian society, where more rebellions occurred. Eventually Vyhovsky surrendered the office of hetman and fled to Poland. The newly re-installed Yurii Khmelnytsky signed the newly composed Pereyaslav Articles that were increasingly unfavorable for the Hetmanate and later led to introduction of serfdom rights.\n\nIn 1667, the Russo-Polish war ended with the Treaty of Andrusovo, which split the Cossack Hetmanate along the Dnieper River: Left-bank Ukraine enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the Tsardom of Russia, while Right-bank Ukraine remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was temporarily occupied by the Ottoman Empire in the period of 1672-1699 (\"see\" the Treaty of Buchach and the Treaty of Karlowitz). For a short time, Petro Doroshenko became the hetman of both banks. After treason by Demian Mnohohrishny and a new Polish offensive Dorosenko concluded an alliance with the Ottomans, who granted him Ukraine, while the hetman agreed to support Ottoman military action with his army. \"By 1669 the Porte issued a patent (berat, nişan) granting Doroshenko all of Cossack Ukraine as an Ottoman sancak or province\". After the defeat of the Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, Poland managed to recover right-bank Ukraine by 1690, except for the city of Kiev, and reincorporated it into their respective voivodeships of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while all the Hetmanate administration was abolished between 1699 and 1704.\n\nThe period of the Ruin effectively ended when Ivan Mazepa was elected hetman, serving from 1687 to 1708. He brought stability to the Hetmanate, which was again united under a single hetman. The Hetmanate flourished under his rule, particularly in literature and architecture. The architectural style that developed during his reign was called the Cossack Baroque style.\n\nDuring his reign, the Great Northern War broke out between Russia and Sweden. Mazepa's alliance with Peter I caused heavy losses of cossacks and Russian interference in the Hetmanate's internal affairs. When the tsar refused to defend Ukraine against the Polish King Stanislaus Leszczynski, an ally of Charles XII of Sweden, Mazepa and some Zaporozhian Cossacks allied themselves with the Swedes on October 28, 1708. The decisive battle of Poltava (in 1709) was won by Russia, putting an end to Mazepa's goal of independence, promised in an earlier treaty with Sweden independence.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Poltava, the Hetmanate's autonomy became nominal and the governorate of Kiev was established. The Russian Empire also began to purge all suspected allies of Mazepa, culminating in the executions of Cossacks in Lebedin. This resulted in the death of over 900 cossack officials, accused of treason.\n\nDuring the reign of Catherine II of Russia, the Cossack Hetmanate's autonomy was progressively destroyed. After several earlier attempts, the office of hetman was finally abolished by the Russian government in 1764, and his functions were assumed by the Little Russian Collegium, thus fully incorporating the Hetmanate into the Russian Empire.\n\nOn May 7, 1775, Empress Catherine II issued a direct order that the Zaporozhian Sich was to be destroyed. On June 5, 1775, Russian artillery and infantry surrounded the Sich and razed it to the ground. The Russian troops disarmed the Cossacks, and the treasury archives were confiscated. The Koshovyi Otaman, Petro Kalnyshevsky, was arrested and incarcerated in exile at Solovetsky Monastery. This marked the end of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.\n\nThe Hetmanate coincided with a period of cultural flowering in Ukraine, particularly during the reign of hetman Ivan Mazepa.\n\nVisitors from abroad commented on the high level of literacy, even among commoners, in the Hetmanate. There was a higher number of elementary schools per population in the Hetmanate than in either neighboring Muscovy or Poland. In the 1740s, of 1,099 settlements within seven regimental districts, as many as 866 had primary schools. The German visitor to the Hetmanate, writing in 1720, commented on how the son of Hetman Danylo Apostol, who had never left Ukraine, was fluent in the Latin, Italian, French, German, Polish and Russian languages Under Mazepa, the Kiev collegium was transformed into an academy and attracted some of the leading scholars of the Orthodox world. It was the largest educational institution in lands ruled by Moscow. Mazepa established another collegium in Chernihiv. These schools largely used the Polish and Latin languages and provided a classic western education to their students. Many of those trained in Kiev – such as Feofan Prokopovich – would later move to Moscow, so that Ivan Mazepa's patronage not only raised the level of culture in Ukraine but also in Moscow itself. A musical academy was established in 1737 in the Hetmanate's then-capital of Hlukhiv. Among its graduates were Maksym Berezovsky (the first composer from the Russian Empire to be recognized in Europe) and Dmitry Bortniansky.\n\nIn addition to traditional printing presses in Kiev, new printing shops were established in Novhorod-Siverskyi and Chernihiv. Most of the books published were religious in nature, such as the \"Peternik\", a book about the lives of the monks of the Kiev-Pechersk monasatary. Books on local history were compiled. In a book written by Inokentiy Gizel in 1674, the theory that Moscow was the heir of ancient Kiev was developed and elaborated for the first time.\n\nIn 1620 The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople reestablished the Kiev Metropolis for the Eastern Orthodox communities that refused to join the Union of Brest. In 1686 the Orthodox Church in Ukraine changed from being under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch in Constantinople to being under the authority of the Patriarch of Moscow. Nevertheless, before and after this date local Church leaders pursued a policy of independence. Hetman Ivan Mazepa established very close relations with Metropolitan Varlaam Iasynsky (reigned 1690–1707). Mazepa provided donations of land, money and entire villages to the Church. He also financed the building of numerous churches in Kiev, including the Church of the Epiphany and the cathedral of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery, and restoration of older churches such as Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, which had deteriorated to near ruin by the mid-17th century, in a style known as Ukrainian Baroque.\n\nThe social structure of the Hetmanate consisted of five groups: the nobility, the Cossacks, the clergy, the townspeople, and the peasants.\n\nAs had been the case under Poland, the nobility continued to be the dominant social class during the Hetmanate, although its composition and source of legitimacy within the new society had changed radically. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Polish nobles and Polonized Ruthenian magnates fled the territory of the Hetmanate. As a result, the noble estate now consisted of a merger between the nobility that had stayed in the territory of the Hetmanate (old noble families that did not succumb to Polonization and lesser nobles who had participated in the uprising on the side of the Cossacks against Poland) with members of the emergent Cossack officer class. Unlike the Polish nobles whose lands were redistributed, the nobles loyal to the Hetmanate retained their privileges, their lands, and the services of the peasants. Together, the old nobles and the new Cossack officers became known as the Distinguished Military Fellows (\"Znachni Viiskovi Tovaryshi\"). Thus, the nature of noble status was fundamentally changed. It no longer depended on ancient heredity, but instead on loyalty to the Hetmanate. Over time, however, Cossack officer lands and privileges too became hereditary, and the Cossack noble and officer class acquired huge landed estates comparable to those of the Polish magnates whom they had replaced and emulated.\n\nMost Cossacks failed to enter the noble estate and continued their role as free soldiers. The lower rank Cossacks often resented their wealthier brethren and were responsible for frequent rebellions, particularly during the Ruin, a period of instability and civil war in the 17th century. These resentments were frequently exploited by Moscow. The Zaporizhian Sich served as a refuge for Cossacks fleeing the Hetmanate as it had been prior to Khmelnytsky's uprising.\n\nDuring the Hetmanate, the Roman Catholic Church and Uniate clergy were driven from Ukraine. The \"black\", or monastic, Orthodox clergy enjoyed a very high status in the Hetmanate, controlling 17% of the Hetmanate's land. Monasteries were exempt from taxes and at no times were peasants bound to monasteries allowed to forgo their duties. The Orthodox hierarchy became as wealthy and powerful as the most powerful nobles. The \"white\", or married, Orthodox clergy were also exempt from paying taxes. Priests' sons often entered the clergy or the Cossack civil service. It was not uncommon for nobles or Cossacks to become priests and vice versa.\n\nTwelve cities within the Hetmanate enjoyed Magdeburg rights, in which they were self-governing and controlled their own courts, finances and taxes. Wealthy townsmen were able to hold office within the Hetmanate or even to buy titles of nobility. Because the towns were generally small (the largest towns of Kiev and Nizhyn had no more than 15,000 inhabitants), this social group was not very significant relative to other social groups.\n\nPeasants comprised the majority of the Hetmanate's population. Although the institution of forced labor by the peasants was reduced significantly by the Khmelnytsky Uprising, in which the Polish landlords and magnates were expelled from the territory controlled by the Hetman, those nobles loyal to the Hetman as well as the Orthodox Church expected the peasants under their control to continue to provide their services. Thus as a result of the uprising, approximately 50% of the territory consisted of lands given to Cossack officers or free self-governing villages controlled by the peasants, 33% of the land was owned by Cossack officers and nobles, and 17% of the land was owned by the Church. With time, the amount of territory owned by the nobles and officers gradually grew at the expense of the lands owned by peasants and rank-and-file Cossacks, and the peasants were forced to work increasingly more days for their landlords. Nevertheless, their obligations remained lighter than they had been prior to the uprising; and until the end of the Hetmanate, peasants were never fully enserfed and retained the right to move.\n\nThe Hetmanate was divided into military-administrative districts known as regimental districts (\"polki\") whose number fluctuated with the size of the Hetmanate's territory. In 1649, when the Hetmanate controlled the Right and the Left Banks, it included 16 such districts. After the loss of the Right Bank, this number was reduced to ten. The regimental districts were further divided into companies (\"sotnias\"), which were administered by captains (\"sotnyk\"). Companies were named either by a toponym of their origin or their leader and greatly varied in numbers up to 16.\n\nIt is known that the first who introduced the regimental division was Prince in 1515. Initially created 20 regiments consisting of 2,000 Cossacks each, were reduced by the King of Poland Stephen Báthory in 1576 to 10.\n\nThe first regimental districts were confirmed by the Treaty of Kurukove in 1625, among which were Bila Tserkva Regiment, Kaniv Regiment, Korsun Regiment, Kiev Regiment, Pereyaslav Regiment, Cherkasy Regiment. All of them were situated within the Kiev Voivodship. According to the Treaty of Zboriv, there were 23 regiments. In 1667 the signing of Truce of Andrusovo between the Muscovy and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth secured 10 regiments of the Left-bank Ukraine for Muscovy, including Kiev, while the other six stayed at the Right-bank Ukraine as part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe capital was the city of Chyhyryn. After the Treaty of Andrusovo, in 1669 the capital was transferred to Baturyn, as Chyhyryn became part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (locate at the Right-bank Ukraine). After the Baturyn's tragedy of 1708 conducted by the Russian army of Aleksandr Menshikov, the area was incorporated into the Kiev Governorate the city of Hlukhiv nominally served as the residence of Hetman.\n\nWithin the Hetmanate, Polish was frequently used as the language of administration and even of command.\n\nIn 1764-65 both Cossack Hetmante and Sloboda Ukraine were liquidated and transformed into Malorossiya Governorate and Sloboda Ukraine Governorate. On the territory of Zaporizhian Sich was created the Novorossiya Governorate. The general-governor of all Ukrainian territories became Pyotr Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky.\n\nThe state supreme power belonged to the General Cossack (Military) Council, while the office of head of state was presided by the Hetman. There also was an important advising body Council of Officers (Starshyna). The hetman was initially chosen by the General Council, consisting of all cossacks, townspeople, clergy and even peasants. By the end of the 17th century, however, its role became more ceremonial as the hetman came to be chosen by the Council of Officers and the Hetmanate itself was turning into an authoritarian state. After 1709, the Battle of Poltava, hetman nomination was to be confirmed by the tsar. Hetman presided until he either died or was forced out by the General Cossack Council. The office of hetman had complete power over the administration, the judiciary, the finances, and the army. His cabinet functioned simultaneously as both the general staff and as the cabinet of ministers. The Hetman also had the right to conduct foreign policy, although this right was increasingly limited by Moscow in the 18th century.\n\nEach of the regimental districts making up the Hetmanate was administered by a colonel who had dual roles as supreme military and civil authority on his territory. Initially elected by that regimental district's Cossacks, by the 18th century the colonels were appointed by the Hetman. After 1709, the colonels were frequently chosen by Moscow. Each colonel's staff consisted of a quartermaster (second-in-command), judge, chancellor, aide-de-camp, and flag-bearer.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, local autonomy was gradually eroded within the Hetmanate. After the Baturyn's tragedy the autonomy was abolished, incorporating it into the Kiev Governorate. After the Battle of Poltava, hetmans elected by the Council of Officers were to be confirmed by the tsar. They served more as a military administrators and have little influence over the domestic policies. The tsar also frequently appointed the colonels of each regimental district.\n\nIn 1722 the governmental branch responsible for the Hetmanate was changed from the College of Foreign Affairs to the imperial Senate. That same year, the hetman's authority was undermined by the establishment of the Little Russian Collegium. It was appointed in Moscow and consisted of six Russian military officers stationed in the Hetmanate who acted as a parallel government. Its duty was ostensibly to protect the rights of rank-and-file Cossacks peasants against repression at the hands of the Cossack officers. The president of the collegiate was Brigadier Stepan Veliaminov. When the Cossacks responded by electing as Hetman Pavlo Polubotok, opposed to these reforms, he was arrested and died in prison without having been confirmed by the tsar. The Little Russian Collegium then ruled the Hetmanate until 1727, when it was abolished and a new Hetman, Danylo Apostol, was elected.\n\nA code consisting of twenty-eight articles was adopted in 1659 that regulated the relationship between the Hetmanate and Russia. It continued to be in force until the Hetmanate's dissolution. With election of the new Hetman new set of \"Pereyaslav Articles\" was signed by Danylo Apostol. The new document, known as the 28 Authoritative Ordinances, stipulated that:\n\n\nIn 1764, the office of Hetman was abolished by Catherine II, and its authority replaced by the second \"Little Russian Collegiate\" that was transformed out of the Little-Russia Prikaz (Office of Ukrainian Affairs) subordinated to the Ambassadorial Office of the Russian Tsardom. The collegiate consisted of four Russian appointees and four Cossack representatives headed by a president, Pyotr Rumyantsev, who proceeded to cautiously but firmly eliminate the vestiges of local autonomy. In 1781, the regimental system was dismantled and the Little Russian Collegiate abolished. Two years later, peasants' freedom of movement was restricted and the process of enserfment was completed. Cossack soldiers were integrated into the Russian army, while the Cossack officers were granted status as Russian nobles. As had previously been the practice elsewhere in the Russian Empire, lands were confiscated from the Church (during the times of the Hetmanate monasteries alone controlled 17% of the region's lands) and distributed to the nobility. The territory of the Hetmanate was reorganized into three Russian provinces (governorates) whose administration was no different from that of any other provinces within the Russian Empire.\n\nBohdan Khmelnytsky pursued a multi-vectored foreign policy for the newly created Ukrainian Cossack state. \"The hetman and his colleagues began to think in terms of establishing a Cossack or Ukrainian state, either independent or allied with some other state.\" One system of opposition to Poland, who was waging war against the Hetmanate, was an \"anti-Catholic block of Orthodox and Protestant states\" that included Muscovy, Moldavia, Wallachia, Transylvania, and Sweden. Another option was to incorporate the Cossack Hetmanate into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as an equal partner to Grand Duchy of Lithuania and to Poland. Another system would include Ukraine into the Ottoman orbit, similar to Wallachia, Transylvania, Moldavia, and the Crimean Khanate. Finally, Khmelnytsky developed another possibility that would have involved pitting the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth against Muscovy and the Don Cossacks or, alternatively, to get Poland join Venice in their fight against the Ottomans.\n\nIn the early days of the uprising, Khmelnytsky recruited the military support of the Crimean Khanate, which was crucial in opposing the Polish forces for the Hetmanate. However, the Crimean Tatars proved to be an unreliable ally because their actions prevented Cossack victories in potentially decisive battles. It was in the interest of the khanate to keep the Cossack uprising alive so that the Poland would be weakened, but a strong rival Ukrainian state was also not favorable for the khanate.\n\nFrom the beginning of the uprising, Khmelnytsky also appealed to Moscow, which denied giving any military aid to Khmelnytsky for almost six years. Between fall 1648 and spring 1651, Khmelnytsky frequently corresponded with Ottomans, who made vague promises of military aid to the Khmelnytsky. The hetman repeatedly asked the sultan to take him as his subject, but the Ottomans never explicitly acknowledged him as such. The sultan did say that \"if the hetman remains faithful\", and \"‘ahdname\", will be granted, meaning that the sultan would guarantee peace and protection. However, by 1653, it became clear to Khmelnytsky that no \"‘ahdname\" would be granted. Khmelnytsky would show his letters from the sultan to the Muscovite tsar to blackmail him into accepting the hetman into his suzerainty. The Pereyaslav Agreement, signed in March 1654, was a deal to incorporate Ukraine under Russian protection as an autonomous duchy and led to a war between Poland and Muscovy. Despite this treaty, Khmelnystky continued to correspond with the Ottomans in order to pit the Muscovites and the Ottomans against each other. He told each side that they had allied with the other only for tactical reasons.\n\nAfter Bohdan Khmelnytsky died in 1657, Ukraine become more instable, leading to conflicts between pro-Polish and pro-Muscovite factions of Cossacks. In 1658, hetman Ivan Vyhovsky negotiated the Union of Hadiach, which would set up a three-part Commonwealth, incorporating the Cossack Hetmanate as the \"Grand Duchy of Ruthenia\" on equal footing with the current members: the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the fall of Vyhovsky meant that this wouldn't come to fruition, as conflicts continued within the Cossack state. By 1660, the state was essentially divided along the Dnieper river, with a Polish-controlled west and a Muscovite-controlled east. In 1663, Cossacks rebelled against the Commonwealth and with the help of the Crimean Tatars in 1665, Hetman Petro Doroshenko took power, with the hopes of taking Ukraine out from under both Muscovy and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The two powers had completely ignored the Hetmanate's interests and partitioned the Hetmanate along the Dnieper in the Truce of Andrusovo. In 1666, Doroshenko restarted Cossack correspondence with the Ottomans.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire perceived the Truce of Andrusovo as a threat and began to engage in a more active policy in the region. On 8 June 1668, Doroshenko became the sole hetman of all Ukraine and returned to the idea of putting Ukraine under Ottoman protection, knowing that it would be difficult to survive. Following negotiations, both parties agreed that 1,000 janissaries wouldn't be stationed in Kodak and Ukraine would not have to pay any tribute. Doroshenko also drafted 17 articles on the basis of which he would accept Ottoman protection. Doroshenko issued a letter of submission to the sultan on December 24, 1668, which was confirmed by the Sublime Porte by June 1669. When the Commonwealth attempted to unseat Doroshenko and take over the Hetmanate, the Ottomans declared war in 1672 and marched north on Kamianets-Podilskyi, with Doroshenko's Cossacks and the Crimean Tatars on their side. Following the war, the Ottomans signed a treaty with the Commonwealth, which handed the region of Podolia over to the Ottomans. Continued fighting with the Commonwealth resulted in the Ottomans ceding the province of Podolia back to the Commonwealth in the Treaty of Karlowitz. In 1674, the Muscovy invaded the Hetmanate and besieged the capital of Chyhyryn, leading the Ottomans and Crimean Tatars to send their armies to confront the Muscovites. The Muscovites withdrew before any confrontation happened, but the Ottomans razed and plundered the settlements in the Hetmanate that had been friendly to the Muscovites in accordance with \"Darü’l-İslam\". Doroshenko surrendered to the Muscovites 2 years later, in 1676.\n\nAlthough the Ottomans, Poles and Muscovites all had evidence that the Cossack Hetmanate swore allegiance to multiple parties simultaneously, \"they chose to pretend they were not aware of any dual loyalty\". The Ottomans did not consolidate their position in Ukraine with a strong military presence, because a frontier buffer zone suited their interests. The Ottomans referred to the Cossack Hetmanate in multiple ways. The Hetmanate under Khmelnytsky was called an eyalet; under Doroshenko, it was called a sancak (province) by June 1669. The Ottomans called the Cossack Hetmanate \"the country of Ukraine\" (\"Ukraniya memleketi\"). Historian Viktor Ostapchuk discusses the Ukrainian-Ottoman relationship in the following way:\n\n\n"}

He played college football for the Texas A&M Aggies, and was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest punters in NFL history, Lechler was named an All-Pro nine times during his career, and made seven Pro Bowls. He led the league in punting average five times and is the NFL's all-time leader in career punting average.\n\nLechler attended East Bernard High School in East Bernard, Texas, and was a standout in football, basketball, golf, and baseball. As quarterback, punter and placekicker, he led East Bernard to the state quarterfinals his senior year, completing 87 of 101 (86.1%) passes for 1,640 yards and 11 touchdowns. In his high school career, he passed for nearly 5,000 yards and averaged 41.6 yards per punt. His longest punt in high school was 85 yards.\n\nLechler attended Texas A&M University, and played for the Aggies football team from 1996 to 1999. A versatile and talented player, he was not only the Aggies' punter but also kicked off, was the long field goal kicker, served as the holder for short field goals and PATs, and was the emergency quarterback. As a junior, he completed a 29-yard pass on a fake punt against Baylor and threw a touchdown pass to Dan Campbell on a fake field goal in a hard-fought 17–10 win against Texas Tech.\n\nWhen injuries depleted the depth chart, Lechler served as the backup quarterback for the 1998 Big 12 championship game. At one point in the game, the Aggies' last healthy quarterback Branndon Stewart appeared shaken and a nervous-looking Lechler threw warmup passes on the sideline. Stewart was able to stay in the game, however, and led the Aggies to a 36–33 victory over Kansas State, earning the Aggies their only Big 12 championship. Because of his contributions in so many facets of the game, coach R. C. Slocum called Lechler \"the team's most valuable player.\"\n\nLechler started his career off strong at Texas A&M, earning Freshman All-America honors in 1996 with a punting average of 42.7 yards. After his sophomore season, he was named to the All-Big 12 team after breaking the Aggie single season record with an average of 47.0 yards per punt. He was named to The Sporting News All-America team as a junior in 1998, and was also an Associated Press first team All-American honors as a senior in 1999, a year in which his 46.5 yards per punt is second in the record books only to his own sophomore record of 47.0. He is the NCAA record holder for career punt average with a mark of 44.7 yards per punt. He made six career punts of 69 yards or longer, and 38 \"coffin-corner\" kicks in his final two seasons. He was also voted to the All-Big 12 Conference first team by the league's head coaches, The Associated Press, the Austin American Statesman, The Dallas Morning News, Football News, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Houston Chronicle and the Kansas City Star.\n\nLechler had only one punt blocked, against Ohio State in the 1999 Sugar Bowl, and only one of his punts was returned for a touchdown, during his college career.\n\nSince entering the NFL in 2000, Lechler set various NFL and Oakland Raiders records. He booted at least one punt of 50 yards or more in 33 consecutive games from Week 13 of 2003 through Week 14 of 2005, the longest streak by any player since the AFL/NFL merger in 1970. He has been named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week twice, and has played in 158 regular-season league games and seven playoff games, including Super Bowl XXXVII. He was seven-time Pro Bowler, in 2001, 2004 and 2007–2011, and was voted All-Pro nine times, in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007–2011. He holds the NFL record for best average per punt in a career (47.3), surpassing even the legendary Sammy Baugh. He has the five best single-season punting averages in Raiders history, including a career-best 51.1 in 2009, the second-highest single-season average in league history (to Baugh's 51.4 in 1940).\n\nOn September 3, 2000, in the season opener against the San Diego Chargers, Lechler had a season-high 10 punts for a season-high 424 net yards (42.4 average) in his NFL debut. On November 5, 2000, against the Kansas City Chiefs, he converted all seven extra point attempts in the game.

In his rookie season, he had 65 punts for 2,984 net yards for a 45.91 average.\n\nThe Raiders qualified for the playoffs with a 12–4 regular season record. Lechler made his playoff debut in the Wild Card Round against the Miami Dolphins. In the 27–0 victory, he had five punts for 234 net yards (46.8 average). In the AFC Championship against the Baltimore Ravens, he had seven punts for 315 net yards (45.00 average) in the 16–3 loss.\n\nOn September 9, 2001, in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, Lechler had four punts for 185 net yards (46.25 average).

Overall, he recorded 73 total punts for 3,375 net yards for a 46.23 average.\n\nLechler and the Raiders once again made the playoffs, but their season ended against the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round.\n\nLechler's third professional season saw his team have a lot of success. On September 29, against the Tennessee Titans, he had three punts for 134 net yards for a 44.67 average in his season debut. On October 6, 2002, the Buffalo Bills, he had five punts for a season-high 250 net yards for a 50.00 average.

C.A.C.A. is the United States' oldest Asian American civil rights organization.\n\nC.A.C.A. was originally named the \"Native Sons of the Golden State\" (similar to the Native Sons of the Golden West) and changed to its present name in 1915 to reflect its national presence. By that time, three lodges within California in Los Angeles (1914), San Francisco (1915), and Oakland (1917) were chartered as local lodges. In the early 1920s, the building housing the national headquarters at 1044 Stockton Street in San Francisco was completed. As interest for local lodges grew beyond the Golden State, the organization's name was changed to accommodate a national alliance, the Chinese American Citizens Alliance.\n\nAs of 2016, there are nineteen local lodges around the United States, including Albuquerque, Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Greenville, Oakland, Orange County, Peninsula (Silicon Valley), Phoenix, Portland, Salinas, San Antonio, Greater San Gabriel Valley, San Francisco, Tucson, Chicago, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and Greater New York.\n\nThe Grand Lodge became the highest governing body of the Alliance with its officers elected during each biennial convention. Local lodges each have their own board of officers and associates. In addition, each local lodge annually chooses a Grand Representative to serve in a Liaison capacity between their own lodge and the Grand Lodge.\n\nThe Purposes and Objectives of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance are to empower Chinese Americans and to improve the organization by:\nThe Cardinal Principles each Member must abide by are that:\n\nC.A.C.A has had over a century of civil rights advocacy and local community development. \"The Chinese Times\", founded in 1924 by Walter U. Lum, became the official and national newspaper of the Alliance for over 60 years and, at one point, grew to the largest circulated Chinese language newspaper in the country. Many community projects, such as the City College of San Francisco Chinatown/North Beach campus, San Francisco Chinatown Playground, and a San Francisco Chinatown police substation, have been due to the efforts and influence of Alliance members.\n\nIn recent times, C.A.C.A. continues to promote immigrant literacy programs, support the preservation of historical sites and landmarks, and approach local and state governments to ensure Asian American topics are adequately covered in school curriculums. In 2012, through the collective effort of many Asian Americans including members of the C.A.C.A., worked with the 112th Congress to secure the passage of two resolutions (H Res. 683 and S. Res. 201), expressing regret for the passage of Chinese Exclusion Laws. For H Res. 683, the House of Representatives passed the resolution by unanimous consent expressing regret over the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n\nC.A.C.A. has had a history of youth outreach programs. The Chinese American Citizens Alliance LA Lodge Youth Council (YC) was formed in August 2001 and is supported by the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, Los Angeles Chapter. It was created in response to the growing number of students seeking college entry counseling. The main goals of the Youth Council are to assist students with the college admission process, provide opportunities for them to perform community service and for youth leadership development. Membership currently consists of high school students, college students, and recent college graduates residing in the San Fernando Valley, Chinatown, Foothill (Arcadia and Temple City), West and East San Gabriel Valley.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1975998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1975998", "title": "Brunei revolt", "text": "Brunei revolt\n\nThe Brunei revolt () was a December 1962 insurrection in the British protectorate of Brunei by opponents of its monarchy and its proposed inclusion in the Federation of Malaysia. The insurgents were members of the TNKU (North Kalimantan National Army), a militia supplied by Indonesia and linked to the leftwing Brunei People's Party (BPP), which favoured a North Borneo Federation. The TNKU began co-ordinated attacks on the oil town of Seria (targeting the Royal Dutch Shell oil installations), on police stations, and on government facilities around the protectorate. The revolt began to break down within hours, having failed to achieve key objectives such as the capture of Brunei town and Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III. The revolt influenced the Sultan's 1963 decision not to join Malaysia. It is seen as one of the first stages of the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.\n\nThe northern part of the island of Borneo was composed of three British territories: the colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo (to be renamed Sabah) and the protectorate of the Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei became a British protectorate in 1888, had an area of about and some 85,000 people. Just over half of the people were Malays, a quarter were Chinese, and the rest were Dayaks, the indigenous people of Borneo. Oil was discovered in 1929 near Seria and the Shell Petroleum Company concession provided the Sultanate with a huge income. The capital, then called Brunei Town, was on a river some from the coast.\n\nIn 1959, the Sultan, Sir Omar Ali Saifuddin III, established a legislature with half its members nominated and half elected. Elections were held in September 1962 and all of the contested seats were won by the Brunei People’s Party.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1962, the United Kingdom, Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were involved in negotiations to form a new Malaysian Federation. However, the Philippines and particularly Indonesia opposed any move toward unification of North Borneo and Sarawak with the new federation. This external opposition toward unification strengthened by widespread anti-Federation sentiment within Sarawak and Brunei itself. The Brunei People’s Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on condition of the unification of the three crown colonies of northern Borneo (total about 1.5 million people, half Dayak) with their own sultan. It was thought that the resultant sultanate would be strong enough to resist domination by Malaya or Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants. Local opposition and sentiments against the Malaysian Federation plan have often been under-represented in historical writings on the Brunei Rebellion and the subsequent Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. In fact, political forces in Sarawak had long anticipated their own national independence as promised (but later aborted) by the last White Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke, in 1941.\n\nThe North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysian Federation plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and the Malayan peninsula, and an unwillingness to be subjected to peninsular political domination.\n\nHowever, before the Brunei People’s Party electoral success, a military wing had emerged, the North Kalimantan National Army (Malay abbreviation TNKU), which saw itself as an anti-colonialist liberation party. Its sympathies lay with Indonesia which was seen as having better ‘liberationist’ credentials than Malaya and Singapore. Its 34-year-old leader A.M. Azahari had lived in Indonesia and was in touch with Indonesian intelligence agents. He had recruited several officers who had been trained in clandestine warfare in Indonesia. By late 1962, they could muster about 4000 men, a few modern weapons and about 1000 shotguns.\n\nHints of brewing trouble came in early November 1962 when the Resident for the 5th Division of Sarawak, Richard Morris (an Australian), who was based in Limbang (sandwiched between the two parts of Brunei) received information. Special Branch police from Kuching visited Limbang but only found some illegal uniforms with TNKU badges. Later in November, Morris heard that an insurrection was planned for Brunei, but not before 19 December. Claude Fenner, the Inspector General of the Malayan Police flew to Sarawak to investigate but found no evidence. However, the Chief of Staff in the British Far East Headquarters in Singapore did review and update the contingency plan, PALE ALE, for Brunei. However, the risk was assessed as low and the British Far East Land, Sea and Air Commanders-in-Chief were away from Singapore as was the operational commander of land forces, Major General Walter Walker.\n\nOn 6 December, Morris heard the rebellion would start on the 8th. On 7th, similar information reached John Fisher, the resident of the 4th Division of Sarawak, based in Miri some 20 miles (30 km) west of Brunei. As a result, police were put on full alert through Brunei, North Borneo and Sarawak, and Police Field Force reinforcements were flown from Kuching to Miri.\n\nContrary to popular belief, no firm evidence has ever been unearthed to support claims that the Indonesian President, Sukarno, had territorial ambitions over Sarawak (he always held firmly to the 1945 decision which delineated Indonesia's boundaries to territories inherited from the former Dutch-Indies, and this might explain why he eagerly pursued Papua's–but not East Timor's–annexation). More likely was that Sukarno invested hopes for the establishment of a North Kalimantan state aligned to Jakarta's anti-colonial/imperialist geopolitics, in which he found suitable allies.\n\nIn effort to thwart any effort to form Malaysia, Indonesia became actively involved in subterfuge operations and later declared war on Malaysia. During this period, Indonesian agents came into contact with local opposition that was against the idea of a federation.\n\nThe rebellion broke out at 2:00 am on 8 December. Signals from Brunei to British Far East Headquarters reported rebel attacks on police stations, the Sultan’s Istana, the Prime Minister’s house and the power station, and that another rebel force was approaching the capital by water. Far East Headquarters ordered ALE YELLOW, which placed a force of two Gurkha infantry companies on 48 hours notice to move.\n\nMost of the attacks in Brunei town were repulsed although the electricity supply was cut off. At this stage it was not known that rebels had attacked police stations throughout Brunei, in the 5th Division of Sarawak and on the western edge of North Borneo. Miri was still in government hands but Limbang had been taken by the rebels. The situation was most serious in Seria where the rebels had captured the police station and were dominating the oilfields.\n\nNine hours after ALE YELLOW, ALE RED was ordered and two companies of 1st Battalion, 2nd Gurkha Rifles, of 99th Infantry Brigade, moved to the RAF airfields at Changi and Seletar in Singapore to fly to Labuan Island in Brunei Bay. The Gurkhas' embarkation went slowly because the RAF was unprepared and following normal peacetime procedures. The troops were in a Bristol Britannia and three Blackburn Beverleys and the latter were diverted in flight from Labuan to Brunei airfield when it was learned that this was not in rebel hands.\n\nThe Beverleys landed at about 10:00 pm and the Gurkhas advanced into Brunei. They fought a series of actions, suffering six casualties, two fatal. A small group of Gurkhas led by Captain Digby Willoughby rescued the Sultan and took him to police headquarters. An advance to Seria met strong opposition and returned to Brunei to counter a rebel threat to its centre and the airfield.\n\nOn 9 December, John Fisher called on the Dayak tribes for help by sending a boat with the traditional Red Feather of War up the Baram River. Tom Harrisson, the Curator of the Sarawak Museum in Kuching and leader of resistance to the Japanese in the Second World War also arrived in Brunei. He summoned the Kelabits from the highlands around Bario in the 5th Division, the centre of his wartime resistance. Hundreds of Dayaks responded, and formed into companies led by British civilians all commanded by Harrison. This force reached some 2,000 strong, and with excellent knowledge of the tracks through the interior (there were no roads), helped contain the rebels and cut off their escape route to Indonesia.\n\nMeanwhile, reinforcements flowed into Labuan. The 2nd Gurkhas were brought up to battalion strength. On 10 December, the Far East ‘spearhead battalion’, the Queen’s Own Highlanders began arriving in Brunei. Brigadier Patterson, commander 99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade arrived to take overall command from Brigadier Pat Glennie, normally the Brigadier General Staff at Far East HQ. Both reported to Lieutenant General Sir Nigel Poett, the Far East Land Forces Commander in Singapore. Seria and Limbang remained in rebel hands. Further reinforcements arrived in the following days. These enabled Seria and Limbang to be recaptured.\n\nBy 17 December, the rebellion had been held and broken. Some 40 rebels were dead and 3,400 captured. The remainder had fled and were assumed to be trying to reach Indonesia. Of the leaders, Azahari was in the Philippines and Yassin Affendi was with the fugitives.\n\nThe road route to Seria was judged too vulnerable to ambush and there were no naval resources for a move by sea. Reconnaissance by an Army Air Corps Beaver revealed rebel flags over the Shell complex, and the 6 miles (10 km) of coast seemed in rebel hands. However, there appeared to be a potential landing site for light aircraft west of Seria and east of the town – the runway at Anduki Airfield had been cleared by a small group of western civilians who had managed to escape the rebels. One escapee, Hugh McDonald, a shell contractor and WWII veteran, made contact with Singapore installations to confirm a safe landing. On 10 December, a company of the Queen’s Own Highlanders boarded five Twin Pioneers and a Beverley at Brunei. The Twin Pioneers landed west of Seria and the Beverley at Anduki. A police station 2 miles (3 km) from the western landing was recaptured and so was the Telecommunications Centre after a brief fight. Anduki airfield was quickly recaptured. However, the main Seria police station, with 48 hostages, most Shell expatriates, was not secured until the 12th.\n\nAnduki Airfield is today a grass airstrip with a concrete ramp used almost exclusively by Brunei Shell Petroleum aircraft and helicopters servicing Brunei's extensive offshore petroleum production installations. The Sultan of Brunei and members of the Royal Family sometimes use it in their helicopters when they wish to visit Seria, especially on State occasions. Regarded as strategically important because of its proximity to the oil town of Seria, its history in the Brunei Revolt and the paucity of other Brunei airstrips usable by fixed-wing military aircraft, Anduki and the adjacent highway to Bandar Seri Begawan is one of the first areas to be secured by Gurkha and Brunei Army troops when they deploy on contemporary war exercises.\n\nOn 8 December 1962, from two till five in the morning, shots could be heard near police stations all over Brunei. According to news received from Temburong, the District Officer Pengiran Haji Besar bin Pengiran Haji Kula and a few others from Brunei security forces and a number of civilians were executed for refusing to join in the rebellion.\n\nBy five in the morning, TNKU controlled Pekan Besar. News came that a number of civil servants at Pekan Besar had managed to escape capture. Around an hour later at downtown, the Deputy Chief Minister was granted an audience by the Sultan. After the meeting, the Sultan made a radio declaration condemning TNKU, the armed wing of the Brunei People's Party, for treason.\n\nIn Limbang, rebels attacked the local police station, killing five local policemen. The rebels then obtained the surrender of British official R.H. Morris, his wife, four other Europeans and an American Peace Corps worker, and took the remaining police officers hostage. On the first night of their captivity, they were crowded into the police cells, the second night they were moved to the local hospital where they overheard the rebels planning their hangings the following day.\n\nEighty-nine Marines of 42 Commando had arrived in Brunei on 11 December, led by Captain Jeremy Moore (who later commanded the British Forces during the Falklands War). After acquiring two landing craft, the Marines were transported to Limbang by Royal Navy crews led by Captain Black (who later commanded HMS \"Invincible\" during the Falklands War) and staged their arrival at dawn, 13 December. The landing craft had manually operated ramps which took too long to lower and the senior officer took the decision that the Marines would vault over the sides or over the ramps under covering fire from Vickers machine guns mounted on the bridges. One landing craft's bridge was raked with Bren gun fire, disabling the crew, and the craft rammed into the river bank and quay.\n\nThe only map they had was 10 years old at the time. The Marines lost the element of surprise due to the loud noise of their boats, but succeeded nevertheless in suppressing the rebels' machine guns and landed.\n\nThe attackers started their search for the hostages who, on hearing shots, began singing the American song \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\", allowing the first rescue party to quickly locate them. The first rescue party was attacked and two of the three Marines were killed. A second rescue party fought off the rebels from around the hospital and freed the hostages. About 200 rebels, who had little if any military training and a paltry assortment of weapons (about a dozen Bren guns and Lee–Enfield rifles, but mainly shotguns, muskets and daggers), tried to resist, but were beaten back.\n\nFive Marines were killed and eight wounded in the attack. British sources do not list rebel losses in this incident, but Clodfelter estimates losses in the Brunei Rebellion as 40 rebels and six Marines.\n\nThere is a memorial to all the dead in Limbang. The leader of the Limbang rebels was caught and tried and received an eleven-year prison sentence. He lives (2007) on the outskirts of Limbang.\n\nBy 17 December 42 Commando was complete in Brunei and 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) had landed from the cruiser HMS \"Tiger\" in Miri. 40 Commando aboard the commando carrier HMS \"Albion\" was diverted from Miri to Kuching. On 14 December, most of the unit reinforced the artillery battery sent there as infantry on 12 December to pre-empt trouble from the Chinese of the Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) who were openly sympathetic to the Brunei rebels. The last company of 40 Commando landed near Seria. \"Albion\" also provided helicopters from the embarked Naval Air Commando squadrons.\n\nMajor General Walter Walker took over as COMBRITBOR and Director of Operations (DOBOPS) on 19 December with command of all land, sea and air forces assigned to Borneo and reporting directly to the Commander-in-Chief Far East Forces, Admiral Sir David Luce. Three weeks after the rebellion started, 99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade had 5 infantry battalions and HQ 3rd Command Brigade was in Kuching. This force was supported by the Brunei Malay Regiment, the Sarawak Rangers, police of the three territories including paramilitary Police Field Force, and Harrison’s force of now 4,000 Dayaks. Suitable coastal patrol naval vessels were lacking (the Royal Navy didn’t have any) so minesweepers were used. The RAF had medium and short range transport aircraft. In January, the Queen's Own Highlanders and 1/2 Gurkhas were replaced by the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and 1/7 Gurkhas and special forces troops had also arrived.\n\nMopping up operations, by this time including a commando artillery battery with their guns, continued until May 1963. On 18 May, a patrol of 1/7 Gurkhas were guided by an informer to a camp in the mangrove. They flushed a party of rebels towards an ambush. Ten rebels were killed or captured. They were the remnants of TNKU headquarters and one of the wounded, shot in the hip, was Yassin Affendi.\n\nHowever, on 12 April, the police station at Tebedu in the 1st Division of Sarawak was attacked and captured. The attackers had come from Kalimantan. This marked the beginning of Confrontation.\n\nThe rebellion also played a role in the Sultan of Brunei's subsequent decision for Brunei to not join the Federation of Malaysia.\n\nThe following units, or significant elements of them, deployed to Borneo in response to the rebellion before May 1963:\n"}

Kroeber suggested in 1918 that the Okwanuchu had become extinct. Very little is known about the location of their villages and settlements, or about their culture, other than a presumed similarity to their Shasta and Achomawi neighbors. The archaeological sites associated with their range date back in excess of 5,000 years.\n\nThe Okwanuchu were speakers of the Okwanuchu language, an older Hokan-speaking family of languages. Although their language was closely related to that of the Shasta language of the main Shasta tribe, it contained some elements of Wintu and Achomawi.\n\nMembers of the Penutian-speaking family of languages, especially the Wintu, arrived in central Northern California in the vicinity of Redding, California about 1200 years ago, likely from southern Oregon. The Wintu possessed superior technology, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory at the expense of the Okwanuchu and the Achomawi to the north, and the Yana to the east. It appears likely that even if Europeans and Americans not intervened (beginning in the 1820s), the Wintu would have absorbed or otherwise eliminated the Okwanuchu over the course of the coming centuries.\n\n\n\n"}

Among his classmates was Philippe Pétain, famous French general of World War I and the ill-fated future leader of the Vichy France government in World War II.\n\nAfter St. Cyr, he entered Saumur, France's premier cavalry school, where he trained to be an officer. He was later sent to Algiers, helping to put down an uprising. It was while in Algiers that he had his first duel, starting his career as the most celebrated duelist of his day.\n\nHe resigned from the cavalry in 1882 and married Medora von Hoffman, sometimes called the Marquise. Soon thereafter, he would move to the North Dakota badlands to begin ranching, purchasing for that purpose. He also opened a stagecoach business. He named his simple vernacular house in Medora, North Dakota, the \"Chateau de Mores\"; it is preserved as a historic house there.\n\nHe tried to revolutionize the ranching industry by shipping refrigerated meat to Chicago by railroad, thus bypassing the Chicago stockyards. He built a meat-packing plant for this purpose in Medora, the town he founded in 1883 and named for his wife.\n\nHe became famous in the West as a rancher and gunslinger, getting arrested for murder a few times. He was always acquitted. Known as an adventurer, he was quick to anger and was engaged in numerous duels throughout his life; he notoriously sent Theodore Roosevelt what the latter interpreted as a challenge to a duel, though nothing came of it.\n\nOutlaws were very numerous in the Badlands, and cattle and horse rustling had become unbearably common. Frontiersman Granville Stuart organized a vigilance committee to fight the rustlers. De Morès told Roosevelt of the plan, and the two offered their services to be vigilantes. Stuart declined, stating that de Morès and Roosevelt were both well known and their presence could ruin the element of surprise. Stuart's vigilantes, called The Stranglers, struck viciously against the rustlers, greatly weakening their power in the Badlands.\n\nBy 1885 it became obvious that de Morès' business was failing. He was losing a business war against the beef trust, and the enterprise collapsed. He would later sell the ranch and other assets in the Badlands.\n\nSubsequently, he left Dakota Territory and returned to France. He was commissioned by the French army to build a proposed railroad in Vietnam, from the Chinese frontier to the Gulf of Tonkin, and arrived in Asia to lead railroad construction in the fall of 1888. He observed the Vietnamese people, and cautioned the French to be kind to them. He wrote, \"The colonization of Tonkin will not be accomplished with rifles, but with public works.\"\n\nHe believed a railroad was needed there, and hoped to have one extending all the way to Yunnan Province in China. This was partly a reaction to a British railroad being built from Burma to China.\n\nPolitical intrigue, being notorious in France in that day, impeded construction of the railroad. A prime minister was deposed, which led to a new undersecretary of the navy, Jean Constans, who opposed de Morès' plan from the start. The Marquis was recalled to France in 1889, and the railroad project was ruined.\n\nUpon his return, he would be embroiled in political controversies for the remainder of his life.\n\nHe started by attacking Constans, enlisting the aid of Georges Clemenceau, but failed to unseat him in the next election. His politics became overtly anti-Semitic, and he challenged Ferdinand-Camille Dreyfus, a Jewish member of the Chamber of Deputies, to a duel after Dreyfus wrote an article attacking him. De Morès said he wanted Gaul for the Gauls, and Dreyfus replied by writing that de Morès had a Spanish title, a father with an Italian title, and an American wife who was neither Christian nor French. At the duel Dreyfus fired first and missed, and the Marquis wounded his opponent in the arm.\n\nIn 1889 de Morès joined \"La Ligue antisémitique de France\" (Antisemitic League of France) founded by Edouard Drumont. After more verbal attacks on Jews, he went to Algeria to strengthen the French hold there and stop British advances into the interior of Africa. He used anti-Semitic rhetoric to his advantage in Algeria, giving speeches claiming that French and African Jews and the British were conspiring to conquer the entire Sahara Desert. With the British in a difficult position in the Sudan after the death of General Charles George Gordon in the siege of Khartoum, de Morès planned a trip there to meet with the Mahdi, a powerful Muslim leader who was intent on undermining British hegemony in the region. He traveled to North Africa, selected Arabic men in Tunis to escort him, and set out his caravan towards Kebili.\n\nThe French officer in charge of the post at Kebili, Lieutenant Leboeuf, received a telegram from the French Intelligence Officer and Military attaché in Tunis, advising him not to give de Morès' expedition any assistance. Furthermore, Leboeuf was told to ensure de Morès traveled by the way of the Berresof oasis. A marabout from Guemar dispatched a messenger to dissident tribesmen in Messine, southeast of Ghadames, telling them to come to Berresof at once to kill a Frenchman. The recipients of the message were told the man they were to kill would be carrying a great deal of money, would not have an official escort, and that whoever killed him would not be prosecuted. While he was in Kebili, de Morès received a telegram from General de la Roque, commander of the division at Constantine, Algeria, telling him that Tuareg guides would be waiting for him at Berresof. de Morès expressed surprise at this, as he had not asked de la Roque to find him any guides. de Morès departed Kebili on May 20, and the Tuareg \"guides\" joined his caravan on June 3. On the morning of June 9 the Tuareg sprung their attack. de Morès was able to kill several of his attackers before he was gunned down.\n\nOn 28 July 1902, after a trial in Sousse (Tunisia) two of the murderers were sentenced: El-Kheir ben Abd-el-Kader to the death penalty and Hamma Ben Cheikh to 20 years of forced labor. During the trial his widow, the Marquise, sought to expose the French government as responsible for the murder but the tribunal did not agree. She then even paid Isabelle Eberhardt to return to Africa to investigate his death, though Eberhardt made no real attempts to investigate the matter, and no government official was ever convicted.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1976026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976026", "title": "The empire on which the sun never sets", "text": "The empire on which the sun never sets\n\nThe phrase \"the empire on which the sun never sets\" () has been used to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that it seemed that at least one part of their territory was always in daylight.\n\nIt was originally used for the universal monarchy of the European and American dominions under Emperor Charles V. The term was then used for the Spanish Empire of Philip II of Spain and successors, in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In more recent times, it was used for the British Empire, mainly in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a period in which the British Empire reached a territorial size larger than that of any other empire in history. In the 20th century, the phrase has sometimes been adapted to refer to the global reach of American power.\n\nGeorg Büchmann traces the idea to a speech in Herodotus' \"Histories\", made by Xerxes I before invading Greece.\nγῆν τὴν Περσίδα ἀποδέξομεν τῷ Διὸς αἰθέρι ὁμουρέουσαν. οὐ γὰρ δὴ χώρην γε οὐδεμίαν κατόψεται ἥλιος ὅμουρον ἐοῦσαν τῇ ἡμετέρῃ\n\"We shall extend the Persian territory as far as God's heaven reaches. The sun will then shine on no land beyond our borders.\"\n\nA similar concept in the Old Testament might pre-date Herodotus and Xerxes I where Psalm 72:8 speaks of the Messianic King: ‘He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth’ for ‘as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations’ Ps 72:5. This concept had existed in the Ancient Near East before the Old Testament. The Story of Sinuhe (19th century BC) announces that the Egyptian King rules “all what the sun encircles.” Mesopotamian texts contemporary to Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334 – 2279 BC) proclaim that this king ruled “all the lands from sunrise to sunset.”\n\nCharles V of the House of Habsburg controlled in personal union a composite monarchy inclusive of the Holy Roman Empire stretching from Germany to Northern Italy with direct rule over the Low Countries and Austria, and Spain with its southern Italian kingdoms of Sicily, Sardinia and Naples. Furthermore, his reign encompassed both the long-lasting Spanish and the short-lived German colonizations of the Americas. This empire was the first referred to as the \"empire on which the sun never sets\" by several authors during Charles' lifetime.\n\nCharles was born in 1500 in the Flemish region of the Low Countries in modern-day Belgium, then part of the Habsburg Netherlands, from Joanna the Mad (daughter of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon) and Philip the Handsome (son of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor). He inherited his homeland from his father as Duke of Burgundy in 1506, became jure matris king of Castile and Aragon in 1516, and was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. As ruler of Castile and Aragon, he has been referred to as King of Spain. As Holy Roman Emperor, he was crowned King of Germany and King of Italy. He also adopted the title of King of the Indies (Americas) in 1521.\n\nAs ruling prince of the Low Countries he made Brussels, and the palace of Coudenberg in particular, as his main residence and court: there, he announced his legacies in 1515 and announced his abdication in 1555. As ruler of Spain he inherited the possessions of the Crown of Aragon in the south of Italy, and ratified the conquests of the Castillan conquistadores: Hernan Cortes annexed the Aztecs and subjugated Middle America following the Fall of Tenochtitlan, and Francisco Pizarro conquered the Incas and extended colonial rule to South America following the Battle of Cajamarca. As Holy Roman Emperor he managed to defend his German territories in Austria from the Ottomans of Suleiman the magnificent (Siege of Vienna) and his Italian territories in the Duchy of Milan from the French of Francis I (Battle of Pavia): to finance the Ottoman-Habsburg Wars and the Italian Wars the Empire made large use of the gold and silver coming from the Americas. Charles V ratified also the German colonization of the Americas and financed the expedition of the explorer Magellan around the globe. Unable to create a universal monarchy and resist the rise of protestantism, Charles V announced his resignation. His abdication divided his territories between his son Philip II of Spain, who took the colonial territories, and his brother Ferdinand of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary who took the Holy Roman Empire. The Habsburg Netherlands and the Duchy of Milan continued to be part of the Holy Roman Empire, but were also left in personal union with the King of Spain.\n\nCharles's son, Philip II of Spain, made Spain (his homeland) the metropole of the territories that he inherited. In particular, he placed the Council of Castille, the Council of Aragon, the Council of Italy, the Council of Flanders and the Council of the Indies in Madrid. He added the Philippines (named after him) to his colonial territories. When King Henry of Portugal died, Philip II pressed his claim to the Portuguese throne and was recognised as Philip I of Portugal in 1581. The Portuguese Empire, now ruled by Philip, itself included territories in the Americas, in the North and the Sub-Saharan Africa, in all the Asian Subcontinents, and islands in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans.\n\nIn 1585, Giovanni Battista Guarini wrote \"Il pastor fido\" to mark the marriage of Catherine Michelle, daughter of Philip II, to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. Guarini's dedication read, \"\"Altera figlia / Di qel Monarca, a cui / Nö anco, quando annotta, il Sol tramonta.\"\" (\"The proud daughter / of that monarch to whom / when it grows dark [elsewhere] the sun never sets.\").\n\nIn the early 17th century, the phrase was familiar to John Smith, and to Francis Bacon, who writes: \"both the East and the West Indies being met in the crown of Spain, it is come to pass, that, as one saith in a brave kind of expression, the sun never sets in the Spanish dominions, but ever shines upon one part or other of them : which, to say truly, is a beam of glory [...]\". Thomas Urquhart wrote of \"that great Don Philippe, Tetrarch of the world, upon whose subjects the sun never sets.\"\n\nIn the German dramatist Friedrich Schiller's 1787 play, \"Don Carlos\", Don Carlos's father, Philip II, says, \"\" (\"I am called / The richest monarch in the Christian world; / The sun in my dominion never sets.\").\n\nJoseph Fouché recalled Napoleon saying before the Peninsular War, \"Reflect that the sun never sets in the immense inheritance of Charles V, and that I shall have the empire of both worlds.\" This was cited in Walter Scott's \"Life of Napoleon\".\n\nIt has been claimed that Louis XIV of France's emblem of the \"Sun King\" and associated motto, \"\"Nec pluribus impar\"\" were based on the solar emblem and motto of Philip II.\n\nIn the 19th century, it became popular to apply the phrase to the British Empire. It was a time when British world maps showed the Empire in red and pink to highlight British imperial power spanning the globe. Scottish author, John Wilson, writing as \"Christopher North\" in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1829, is sometimes credited as originating the usage. However, George Macartney wrote in 1773, in the wake of the territorial expansion that followed Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, of \"this vast empire on which the sun never sets, and whose bounds nature has not yet ascertained.\" \n\nIn a speech on 31 July 1827, Rev. R. P. Buddicom said, \"It had been said that the sun never set on the British flag; it was certainly an old saying, about the time of Richard the Second, and was not so applicable then as at the present time.\" In 1821, the \"Caledonian Mercury\" wrote of the British Empire, \"On her dominions the sun never sets; before his evening rays leave the spires of Quebec, his morning beams have shone three hours on Port Jackson, and while sinking from the waters of Lake Superior, his eye opens upon the Mouth of the Ganges.\"\n\nDaniel Webster famously expressed a similar idea in 1834: \"A power which has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her possessions and military posts, whose morning drumbeat, following the sun and keeping company with the hours, circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England.\" In 1839, Sir Henry Ward said in the House of Commons, \"Look at the British Colonial empire—the most magnificent empire that the world ever saw. The old Spanish boast that the sun never set in their dominions, has been more truly realised amongst ourselves.\" By 1861, Lord Salisbury complained that the £1.5 million spent on colonial defence by Britain merely enabled the nation \"to furnish an agreeable variety of stations to our soldiers, and to indulge in the sentiment that the sun never sets on our Empire\".\n\nFrom the mid-nineteenth century, the image of the sun never setting can be found applied to Anglophone culture, explicitly including both the British Empire and the United States, for example in a speech by Alexander Campbell in 1852: \"To Britain and America God has granted the possession of the new world; and because the sun never sets upon our religion, our language and our arts...\". \n\nBy the end of the century, the phrase was also being applied to the United States alone. An 1897 magazine article titled \"The Greatest Nation on Earth\" boasted, \"[T]he sun never sets on Uncle Sam\". In 1906, William Jennings Bryan wrote, \"If we can not boast that the sun never sets on American territory, we can find satisfaction in the fact that the sun never sets on American philanthropy\"; after which, \"The New York Times\" received letters attempting to disprove his presupposition. \nA 1991 history book discussion of U.S. expansion states, \"Today ... the sun never sets on American territory, properties owned by the U.S. government and its citizens, American armed forces abroad, or countries that conduct their affairs within limits largely defined by American power.\"\n\nAlthough most of these sentiments have a patriotic ring, the phrase is sometimes used critically with the implication of American imperialism, as in the title of Joseph Gerson's book, \"The Sun Never Sets: Confronting the Network of Foreign U.S. Military Bases\".\n\n"}

Headquartered in Toranomon, Minato-ku, Tokyo, OKI operates in over 120 countries around the world.\n\nOKI manufactured the first telephone in Japan in 1881, and now specializes not only in developing and manufacturing telecommunication equipment but also in information products and mechatronics products, such as Automated teller machine (ATMs) and printers. Its printer business is operated through OKI Data, under the brand name OKI. OKI had a semiconductor business, which it spun off and sold to Rohm Company, Limited on October 1, 2008.\n\nOKI Data Group, which markets its products under the OKI brand, is focused on creating professional printed communications products, applications and services. The OKI Data Group provides a wide range of devices, from printers, faxes and multi-functional products to business applications and consultancy services.\n\nOKI Data Americas also markets the OKI proColor Series, a line of digital production printers designed specifically for the graphic arts and production market in North America to offer print solutions for color-critical applications.\n\nThe company was founded by Kibataro Oki (1848–1906) an engineer formerly employed at a Kobusho (Ministry of Industry) factory. In 1877, only a year after Graham Bell's invention, Kubusho had started an effort to make telephone receivers by reverse engineering and Oki was in the team that came up with the first prototype.\nIn January 1881, convinced that the nation was about to enter the age of communications, Kibataro Oki founded Meikōsha, which was later renamed OKI. The company manufactured the first telephone in Japan in 1881, only five years after Bell invented the phone, and presented a silver-award-winning lacquer-coated wire at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition in London.\n\nOKI contributed immensely to the spread of phones in Japan under the country’s Telephone Expansion Plans. The company not only focused on telephones, but saw the need of automatic exchanges as phones became more common.\nAsano Soichiro of Asano zaibatsu elected chairman in 1912.\n\nDuring World War I, wartime demand brought large profits to OKI as demand for telephone service increased. A strong demand emerged for PBXs (Private Branch Exchange) and at that time, OKI installed the largest PBX system in Japan. In addition to business from Japan, overseas business also grew, providing railroad-type printers, portable telephones and electric wires outside Japan. From around 1920, OKI achieved notable advances in its technical development of the common-battery switchboard. Asano Soichiro's son Soichiro (Asano Taijiro) of Asano zaibatsu appointed chairman in 1931.\n\nIn the late 1930s, OKI’s plants were used towards meeting the military demand for goods having a major influence on OKI’s business. Based on this demand, OKI built new production plants, increased its capital and increased the number of its affiliates.\n\nThough OKI increased its production capacity after the war to restore magnetotype telephones and exchanges that were damaged during the war, OKI endured great difficulties as it moved toward rebuilding itself. On November 1, 1949, Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd. (today’s OKI) was established to replace the former Oki Electric Co., Ltd. And the two years later in November 1951, OKI’s shares were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It was also at this time when OKI started mass-producing the “Type-4 telephone,” which was called the \"symbol of Japan’s postwar reconstruction. OKI was also aware of learning new telecommunication technologies, and in 1956, it was the first to produce a 100-line Ericsson-type crossbar-switching systems for commercial use.\n\nOKI gradually transformed itself into an electronics company from the second half of 1960s into the 1970s.\n\nTo respond to the high-level economic growth Japan was experiencing, OKI needed to speed up its business operations and clarify responsibilities. OKI began producing and supplying business machines such as Teletypewriters, and perforation typewriters. In June 1961, OKI launched OKITYPER2000, an electric teletypewriter that could simultaneously make perforation tapes and book entry forms. The company also developed and sold various general-purpose computers such as OKITAC-5090, the first domestically produced computer to use core memory.\n\nIn 1964 OKI developed OKISAVER, a terminal for online deposits which was provided to financial institutions.\n\nIn addition to minicomputers such as OKITAC series developed in the mid-1960s, OKI began supplying various I/O devices, electroprinters, and dot printers, mainly to the financial industry in the 1970s. OKI’s business at this time included cash dispensers (CDs), automatic depositors(ADs) and automated teller machines (ATMs).\n\nIt was at this time when OKI expanded its overseas business providing telecommunication systems to countries in the Middle East, Central and South American countries as well as other Asian countries. In 1972, OKI established Oki Data Corporation (ODC: today’s OKI Data Americas), a Japan-US joint venture in Philadelphia, to develop the DP100, dot printers.\n\nAround that time in 1975, OKI developed the world’s first automobile telephone system together with Bell Labs. This was the beginning of OKI’s wireless technology, and today (as of 2009) OKI expands this technology into vehicle-to-vehicle communications and other ETC (Electronic toll collection) technologies.\n\nIn May 1980, OKI launched its IF-800 series, which was a successful business-use PC business. It also added a facsimile business unit to develop private sector demand. In 1982, OKI introduced the world’s first cash-recycling ATM, allowing deposited banknotes to be immediately used for withdrawal.\n\n\nIn the early 90s, Japanese economy was in the midst of recession that continued after the bubble economy collapsed, which also hit a strong blow to OKI’s business. In October 1994, OKI spun off its printer and facsimile business, and established Oki Data Corporation. In the later 90’s, with the spread of the Internet, OKI worked on being recognized as the company that offers network solutions.\n\nIn 2004, OKI released its IP CONVERGENCE Server SS9100, the industry’s first Microsoft.Net-compliant server, and in 2006, released its Center Stage NX5000, a carrier-grade communication server compliant with next-generation networks.\n\nIn 2008, as part of its business selection and concentration measures, OKI spun off its semiconductor business to Rohm Co., Ltd.\n\nOki Data Americas, Inc., a subsidiary of Oki Data Corporation of Japan, produces PC peripheral equipment under the OKI brand, including digital color and monochrome printers, serial impact dot matrix printers, multifunction products and facsimiles.\n\nOki Data Americas can be traced back to 1972 when the company was founded as a joint venture between two Philadelphia entrepreneurs and their Japanese customer, Oki Electric to develop and produce information technology products. One of its popular products was the Okimate 10 thermal transfer printer, one of the first affordable color printers for early home computers.\n\nOki Data Americas, Inc. is headquartered in Irving, Texas. Other Oki Data Americas offices are in Mississauga, Canada; Mexico City, Mexico; and São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nOki sponsored English Premier League football club Portsmouth F.C. from 2005 to 2009. From 2003 to 2008, Oki owned the naming rights to OKI Jubilee Stadium in Kogarah, New South Wales, Australia, which houses the NRL team St. George Illawarra Dragons. OKI was also the major sponsor of 1.FC Kaiserslautern from 1990 to 1996. During the 1998-1999 season OKI sponsored the French Ligue 1 team HSC Montpellier.\n\n"}

Hobie also designed a successful monohull, the Hobie 33.\n\nThe company founder, Hobart Alter, began as a surfboard manufacturer in the late 1950s. \nAccording to another source, Alter's focus changed in 1961 to designing an easily beached fiberglass catamaran.\nThe impetus of this shift is attributed to a 1961 boat show in Anaheim, CA which placed Alter in a booth selling surfboards, next to Art Javes, the designer of the new (1961) AQUA CAT 12 sailboat. That sailboat featured lightweight fiberglass hulls with an aluminium tube structure supporting a trampoline style deck for seating. The AQUA CAT catamaran did well in shallow water, but relied on dagger boards to reduce slippage side wise under sail. Dagger boards were also used by the much heavier Pacific Cat from 1960. That design featured a solid fiberglass deck on a 19-foot × 8-foot boat, giving it a weight of almost 500 pounds. Following the 1961 boat show, Alter contacted Arthur \"Art\" Javes, designer of the AQUA CAT to tell him he was also entering the fledgling catamaran market. The first Hobie Cat is credited with being first built in 1965 and featured a structure similar to the AQUA CAT, but slightly heavier with asymmetrically-shaped hulls that did not rely on dagger boards. This design was more readily beached than the AQUA CAT or Pacific Cat.\n\nFrom 1967 on, the new Hobie Cat Company went on to become the largest manufacturer of small catamarans in the world.\nIn 1967, Alter designed the Hobie 14 Catamaran. Alter wanted to make a boat that could be easily launched into the surf. In 1969, Hobie released the Hobie 16, the most popular catamaran ever and the most competitive catamaran class in the world. Over 135,000 Hobie 16 Cats are sailing around the world. The Hobie 18 in 1976, Hobie 17 in 1985, Hobie 21 in 1987, Hobie 18SX in 1989, Hobie 17 Sport in 1990, Hobie 20 in 1991, Hobie 21 Sport Cruiser in 1992, Hobie Wave in 1994, Hobie TriFoiler in 1995, the Hobie Getaway in 2000, then the Hobie Bravo in 2001.\n\nDifferent catamaran models range from in length to , and beams range from to , mast heights range from 20 to .\n\nUnits built:\nHobie 14 46,000,\nHobie 16 135,000,\nHobie 18 18,000,\nHobie Dragoon 800,\nHobie Tiger 1,100\nHobie Wildcat 332\n\nThe Hobie Dragoon was designed by Hobie Cat Europe as a youth trainer for racing. Age target was 12 to 14 years. Double trapeze and spinnaker option to introduce young sailors to high performance. Length: 12 ft 10 in, Beam: 7 ft 1 in, Mast Length: 21 ft, Sail Area: . Main plus Jib, Weight: . D-PN: 83.0\n\nThe Hobie 10 was a small dinghy produced as a response to the Laser dinghy. It has been discontinued.\n\nThe Hobie 14 was the original catamaran designed by Hobie Alter. The general shape and design of the boat is very similar to the later Hobie 16. They share many of the same parts. The 14 was originally designed to be sailed from the beach through the surf and back. It's a unirig with just a main sail. It is possible to convert a standard 14 into a Hobie 14 \"Turbo\", also known as the JT14, or H14T by adding a jib, trapeze and dolphin striker. No longer manufactured by Hobie North America, the Hobie 14 is still produced in limited numbers by Hobie Europe and Hobie Brazil.\n\nThe Hobie 14 is known for its forward mast and very bent banana shaped hull. The forward mast and odd shaped hulls make the boat quite sensitive to weight placement fore and aft. If the helm sits too far forward, he or she can cause the leeward bow to dig in, resulting in a pitchpole. Hobie 14s are great for younger sailors who want a solo-able multi-hull that can be held down without much weight. The boat does not carry passengers well, but used boats can be found quite cheaply.\n\nThe boat is slightly faster than the Wave as standard, and much faster as a Turbo model, but cannot carry anywhere near the amount of weight that the Wave can. It is known for being difficult to tack without a jib. However, the H14 is very quick and light. With the ideal crew weight at about 155 pounds, it is an outstanding platform for an experienced Hobie sailor wishing to both single-hand and be able to right the boat by one's self when the inevitable flying hull goes over too far.\n\nThe Hobie 14 has a D-PN of 86.4 with the Turbo version faster at 83.1.\n\nThe Hobie 16 is the most popular Hobie Cat, both for recreational and racing purposes and as a one-design racer. The boat is 16 ft 7 in long, 7 ft 11 in wide, and has a mast 26 ft 6 in tall, but only weighs 320 pounds. As with the 14, it is intended to be sailed from the beach through the surf, and to be surfed back in on the waves to the beach. Instead of daggerboards or centreboards, the 16 has asymmetrical hulls which act like foils and keep the boat from \"crabbing\", or slipping sideways from the force of the wind. Both jib and main sails are fully battened and total . A trapeze is usually used by the crew and helmsman.\n\nOne notable difficulty in sailing this boat is the tendency of the boat to 'pitchpole' when running downwind; the sail plan and distribution of the flotation of the hulls is such that it can push the bows down far enough to dip them under the water, stopping the front of the boat and leading to a cartwheel or somersault and subsequent capsize of the boat. Sailors compensate for this by putting their weight as far aft as they can while running downwind. Raking the mast aft of the centreline also reduces this motion and can improve the windward sailing ability of the boat.\n\nAlthough capsizing is endemic to the boat, even when it is well sailed, turtling can be prevented. To begin, the mast is supposed to be sealed so it floats. However, Hobies have been at the forefront of the use of a streamlined blimp-like float that attaches to the top of the mast. See Righting a Hobie 16.\n\nThe Hobie 17 was available in two 'trim packages': the Sport has a jib and a small boomlett that is not attached to the mast and is intended for recreational use by two people, while the SE has only the main sail, a full boom, and is designed to be raced by one person. It is 17 feet long, 8 feet wide, has a 27-foot, 7-inch mast and 168 square feet (15.6 m) of sail area (200 ft or 18.6 m with the jib). Both models have swinging centreboards and 'wings', which are made of aluminium tubing that plug into the hulls and covered with reinforced vinyl or mesh covers that can be used as seats, backrests, or provide more leverage when trapezing. The uni-rig or catboat sail plan allows the 17SE to 'point' well, or sail closer to straight upwind than many other Sloop-rigged catamarans. As of 2003 this boat is no longer produced.\n\nThe Hobie 17 has a Portsmouth Number of 783. The SE version has a D-PN of 74.0 and the Sport version has 74.5.\n\nThe FX-One is an import from the France-based Hobie Cat Europe company. Successor of the 17, this boat is designed both for single-handed racing (mainsail + gennaker) and dual-crew sailing (jib + mainsail + gennaker). In both configurations, this boat is eligible for the IHCA racing class. In the two-sailor configuration, this boat is also eligible for the Class 104 multihull class. Relatively uncommon in North America, the FX-One is 17 feet long, 8 feet, 4 inches wide, with a 27-foot, 9-inch mast and 172 square feet (16.0 m) of mainsail area, 3.98 m of jib area, 17.5 m of gennaker area, and weighs in at 326 pounds (148 kg) with the dual crew set-up. It features wavepiercing hulls, and daggerboards. The D-PN is listed as 70.1 without spinnaker and 68.5 singlehanded with spinnaker.\n\nMany people consider the Hobie 18 the quintessential “beachcat.” The Hobie 18 was designed to be not only fast but also rugged. It is designed to be sailed by a crew of two, but can easily carry four passengers when cruising. Experienced sailors can sail the Hobie 18 solo. Unlike the smaller Hobie 14 and 16, the Hobie 18 uses a symmetrical hull design. Although this design gives the 18 a speed advantage, it requires the use of daggerboards when sailing close-hauled or reaching to prevent slipping. The typical configuration for the Hobie 18 is with both a main sail and a jib. The jib on the 18 is set up on a rolling/furling system that wraps the jib around the forestay when it isn't needed. A double trapeze system is also standard equipment on the Hobie 18. Optionally the Hobie 18 may be equipped with wing seats (similar to the 17). Wings were available on the Hobie 18 in two fashions. The shorter wing \"spanned\" from the front to rear crossbar on the Hobie 18 Magnum, while the Hobie 18SX sported even longer wings. These wings reached aft to the stern and forward approximately 20 inches ahead of the front crossbar. Additionally, the SX model had a mast approximately 19 inches taller and high aspect mylar sails. Wings of both types, magnum and SX, are in much demand today due to the added comfort and space provided. They add about 40 pounds. Much to the dismay of many Hobie enthusiasts, the Hobie 18 is currently no longer produced.\n\nThe Tiger, another Hobie Cat Europe import, is Hobie Cat's entry into the Formula 18 multihull class. The Tiger has been very popular and successful both in class racing and Formula 18. At 18 ft long, 8 ft 6 in wide, with a 29 ft 6 in mast and of sail area ( with the spinnaker). It weighs in at a minimum of 396 lb (180 kg) as to conform to the Formula 18 specifications. The class D-PN is 62.1\n\nThe Hobie Pacific is based on the Hobie Tiger, but has skegs instead of daggerboards, a smaller rig, and no boom. The boat is intended to be easier to handle than a F18 boat, and targeted at sailing schools. Sail area is , the optional spinnaker is .\n\nThe Hobie Wildcat was introduced in 2009. Same as the Tiger, it is a Formula 18 boat and has the same measurements, weight, and sail area.\nThe boat is optimized for racing, with wave-piercing bows, a flat bottom in the stern for better planing, and thin daggerboards.\n\nIn contrast to the Tiger, the Miracle 20 has of sail area and takes advantage of light winds. The 20 is 19 ft 6 in long, 8 ft 6 in wide, with a 31-foot mast, weighs 420 pounds, and has a D-PN of 65.0. Some of the early production models had a high rate of hull failures due to a manufacturing defect, but this was rectified in later models. As of June 2007 this model is no longer in production. The Miracle 20 is designed by Jack Groeneveld, a Dutch catamaran sailor (European champion Prindle 19, winner of the Prindle 19 nationals etc.)\n\nThe Hobie Fox was designed by Hobie Cat Europe to meet the Formula 20 racing class rules. The hull shape was designed by world champion A-Class sailor Nils Bunkenberg. It is a modern wave-piercing hull. It has a double trapeze, asymmetrical spinnaker with snuffer retrieval system, high performance daggerboards, race rudders, and sails designed by Giorgio Zuccoli. It is 20 feet long, has an 8-foot, 6-inch beam and weighs . Mainsail area is 194 sq/ft (18 m.) Jibsail area is 52 sq/ft (4.8 m.) Spinnaker area is 269 sq/ft (25 m.) With a D-PN of 60.4, the Fox is the fastest of the Hobie family.\n\nThe 21SC (for Sport Cruiser) was Hobie Cat's first 'family boat'. Intended for casual sailing, this boat has a front trampoline, wings, an outboard motor-mount, and a built-in cooler. Though larger than the at 21 feet long, 8 ft 6 in wide, with a 29-foot mast and of sail, it could be raced off a D-PN of 74.5. The 21SC was quickly displaced by the more rugged, cheaper Getaway and has been phased out by Hobie Cat.\n\nThe 21SE hulls are similar to the 21SC but the similarities end there, the 21SE is a performance oriented boat. It is no longer in production but it had a beam of nearly 10 feet and 14 feet with the wings. The boat was intended for a racing crew of two or three adults. It also had centreboards instead of daggerboards a 33-foot mast and . of sail. It weighs 700 lbs and has a D-PN of 67.0. It had arched, curved crossbars. It was raced as a one design boat in professional racing circuits. The boat is fast and stable but probably saw low production numbers because of its weight, the need to telescope the hulls for trailering and because it is difficult to right the boat if it capsizes without outside assistance.\n\nThe TriFoiler is the fastest production sailboat ever created, with Russel Long sailing a TriFoiler to a Class A world sailing speed record in 1992 that remains unbroken. This sailing hydrofoil stands as the most unusual of Hobie Cat's boats. Designed by the brothers Greg and Dan Ketterman, this trimaran has two sails, one on each ama, and hydrofoils that lift the hulls out of the water at wind speeds of , allowing the boat to reach speeds up to and pull over 2 G in gybe turns. The TriFoiler is based on \"Longshot\", a trimaran designed by the Kettermans and used by Russell Long to set the A class speed sailing record in 1992.\n\nThe TriFoiler is long, wide, weighs , and is sailed by two people. The boat is fitted with 18-foot masts, with a total sail area of . It was the largest multihull boat built by Hobie Cat, with 170 produced between 1995 and 1999; another 30 were built independently prior to production starting at Hobie Cat. Production ceased because of limited popularity; the boat was expensive and fragile, and could be used only in low-wave conditions with winds between .\n\nThe Hobie 33 is a monohull lift-keel boat designed to be very light and very fast. It is considered a ULDB or ultralight displacement boat, a Sportsboat. It was intended to be a trailerable, one design racer/cruiser. To be trailerable in all U.S. states without special overwidth road permits, beam was kept to just 8 feet, which is quite narrow for a boat of this length, although the Hobie 33 was advertised as being capable of sleeping 7 people. A total of 187 Hobie 33s were built between 1982 and 1986.\n\nThe design was the brainchild of Hobie Alter and Sheldon Coleman Sr. To start the project a Bill Lee designed ULDB Santa Cruz 27 named \"Redline\" was purchased, analyzed and then raced in southern California. Once the design stage started Lewie and John Wake were brought in to lend racing yacht design experience. Hobie 18 designer and legendary surfer Phil Edwards designed the keel and rudder.\n\nThere is an active North American class association and national championships yearly. The Hobie 33 is still a competitive offshore sailing yacht and as recently as 2006, 'Mad Max' was the Overall Winner in the Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race, beating vessels of all lengths from 26–90 feet on corrected time using the PHRF formula. In 2005 the Hobie 33 was first in the doublehanded division of Transpacific Yacht Race and went on to win its class against fully crewed boats.\n\nThis series of boats is created of rotomolded plastic and is intended for casual and new sailors.\n\nThese can be split into two main categories, Hobie Cat USA rotomolded boats and Hobie Cat Europe rotomoulded boats. The boats from the USA include the Bravo, Wave and Getaway, whilst the European range consists of the Catsy, Teddy, Twixxy, Max and Tattoo.\n\nThe Bravo is the smallest Hobie sailboat at 12 ft and is intended for one person but can carry two. The relatively narrow beam (53 in) compared to its 19 ft mast leads to considerable \"heeling\", or tipping of the boat compared to other catamarans. The Bravo has the distinction of being able to furl its sail around the mast. The D-PN is 100.0\n\nThe Hobie Wave is intended for one to four passengers, but is easily handled by one with its 13 ft length, 7 ft beam, and 20 ft mast. The Wave was designed by the Morelli/Melvin Engineering firm, and has proved to be extremely popular with beach resorts and rental operations. It is often praised for being rugged and easy to sail. While described as slow and underpowered by catamaran standards, it has a D-PN of 92.1, similar to a Laser (dinghy) that is often considered to be a performance dinghy. Although marketed as a recreational sailboat, an owner-controlled racing class has organized and held regattas since 1998.\n\nThe Hobie Getaway is marketed as a \"social boat\" and is designed with room for up to 6 people, more than Hobie Cat's other boats. The boat has a trampoline both forward and aft of the mast, and is the only rotomolded Hobie to come stock with a jib and have an available trapeze. At 16 ft 7 in, the Getaway is the same length as the Hobie 16; the beam is 7 ft 8 in and the mast is 25 ft tall. It has a D-PN of 83.3.\n\nRacing of Hobie catamarans is completed in a large number of countries around the world. The most popular class is the Hobie 16 which has large fleets sailing in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia, South America and in the islands of Oceania such as New Caledonia and Fiji. The racing is a mix of recreational and competitive with several classes holding regular national, regional and world championships.\n\n\n"}

He was assassinated during the Hong Kong 1967 riots, becoming an icon of freedom of speech in Hong Kong.\n\nBorn in 1929, Lam was a radio commentator at Commercial Radio Hong Kong, which, during the 1960s, was fiercely critical of leftists. During the 1967 riots, he criticised the leftist agitators on his own radio programmes. He created a programme called \"Can't Stop Striking\" (欲罷不能) to satirise the leftist agitators, leading some leftist newspapers at the time to label him as a \"traitor\" and a \"running dog\".\n\nOn 24 August 1967, while Lam was en route to work, men posing as road maintenance workers stopped his vehicle at the end of the street where he lived. They blocked his car doors and doused Lam and his cousin with petrol. They were both then set on fire and burned alive. Lam died later that day in a hospital; his cousin died several days later. A leftist group reportedly claimed responsibility for the assassination.\n\nNo one was ever arrested, although it was believed that 1967 riot leader, Yeung Kwong, then chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and director of the All Circles Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee, ordered the murder. However, pro-Beijing politicians said in 2010 that leftists should not be blamed for Lam's death. The founder of Commercial Radio Hong Kong George Ho launched the programme in his memory.\n\nImmediately after Lam Bun's death, most of the Chinese and English newspapers in Hong Kong condemned the killing as despicable and inhuman. On the other hand, the pro-communist leftist newspaper, \"Ta Kung Pao\", published several articles, condemning Lam Bun but not the murderers. For example, one of the articles titled \"地下突擊隊鋤奸, 敗類林彬受重傷\", which may be translated into English as \"An underground special tactic unit had crushed the villain. The antagonist, Lam Bun, was seriously wounded\". Another article in the same newspaper published on the same day described the brutal murdering as a punishment that Lam Bun had deserved (\"突擊隊懲戒林彬\").\n\nThe Lam Bun assassination angered the people of Hong Kong, eventually leading the government of Hong Kong to suppress the riots. Lam became an icon of free speech. The police offered a reward of HK$50,000, on top of which his employers added HK$100,000, making it the highest reward ever posted in the colony.\n\nIn 2001, Yeung Kwong was awarded the highest honour Grand Bauhinia Medal by Tung Chee Hwa. Critics in Hong Kong felt that it was inappropriate to award a riot leader responsible for Lam's murder.\n\nIn May 2010, after the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong had sponsored a political radio programme on Commercial Radio, pro-democracy activists protested outside the station with images of Lam, complaining that the station had desecrated the memory of Lam, and all the station had stood for. Activists said they had requested an interview to talk about Lam's death. The station later said it respected freedom of speech; the DAB said the shows were about livelihood issues, and denied they promoted a political stance.\n\nTwo DAB lawmakers stepped into the row: Chan Kam-lam said: \"During the '67 riots, it was not just Lam Bun who died. There were very many ordinary citizens who, we don't know for what reason, died ...\" Wong Ting-kwong also said leftists should not be held responsible. Pro-democracy lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan said the DAB were revisionists who \"would rather people not talk about their inglorious past.\" Wong later clarified his comments, saying he had been misunderstood because the phrase 'leftist camp' had different definitions. He said that there was no evidence that Yeung Kwong or the FTU killed Lam Bun. He blamed the media for sensationalising his comments ahead of the 16 May by-election.\n\n"}

When the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway came through with the railway, they built a small flag stop and siding and named it Maple Lake Station.\n\nThe railway brought lumbering to the area and in 1894 the Ludgate Lumber Company bought large amounts of land and began cutting down trees. The company built a general store and three workers homes south of the tracks. In 1904 a school house was built for the children.\n\nIn 1925 the name of the town was changed to Swords, after the Sword family who live around that area, to avoid confusion with another Maple Lake Station. The Swords were responsible for operating many of the businesses in the area and the Swords were voted to have the town named after them. One such business was the Maple Lake Hotel, owned by John and Annie Sword. Annie would stop and inspect the boots of the lumbermen to ensure that they didn't have hobnails, making them likely to scuff the hotel floor. In this case she would place a shingle over the hobnails, rendering the boots safe. The hotel stood until the late 60's or early 70's. A store still stands there to this day but has suffered several break-ins and is in a general state of disrepair.\n\n"}

The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company's Blue Network beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored by the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the \"Five-Star Theater\", an old-time radio variety series that offered a different program each weeknight. Episodes were broadcast live from NBC's WJZ station in New York City and later from a sound stage at RKO Pictures in Los Angeles, California, before returning to WJZ for the final episodes.\n\nThe program depicts the misadventures of a small New York law firm, with Groucho as attorney Waldorf T. Flywheel (a crooked lawyer) and Chico as Flywheel's assistant, Emmanuel Ravelli (a half-wit who Flywheel uses as a fall guy). The series was originally titled \"Beagle, Shyster, and Beagle\", with Groucho's character named Waldorf T. Beagle, until a real lawyer from New York named Beagle contacted NBC and threatened to file a lawsuit unless the name was dropped. Many of the episodes' plots were partly or largely based upon Marx Brothers films.\n\nThe show garnered respectable ratings for its early evening time slot, although a second season was not produced. It was thought that, like most radio shows of the time, the episodes had not been recorded. The episodes were thought entirely lost until 1988, when 25 of the 26 scripts were rediscovered in the Library of Congress storage and republished. Adaptations of the recovered scripts were performed and broadcast in the UK, on BBC Radio 4, between 1990 and 1993. In 1996, some recordings of the original show were discovered (all recorded from the final three episodes), including a complete recording of the last episode to air.\n\nIn 1932 Texaco introduced its \"Fire Chief\" gasoline to the public, so named because its octane rating was 66, higher than the United States government's requirements for fire engines. To advertise its new premium grade fuel, Texaco approached vaudeville comic Ed Wynn to star in a radio show titled \"Fire Chief\". Wynn played the fire chief in front of an audience of 700 and the show was aired live over the NBC Red Network, beginning April 26, 1932. It immediately proved popular with over two million regular listeners and a Co-Operative Analysis of Broadcasting (CAB) Rating of 44.8%.\n\nUpon seeing the success of Wynn's \"Fire Chief\", the Standard Oils in New Jersey, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, and Colonial Beacon, decided to sponsor their own radio program to promote Esso Gasoline and Essolube Motor Oil. They turned to the advertising agency McCann Erickson, which developed \"Five-Star Theater\", a variety series that offered a different show each night of the week. Groucho and Chico Marx, one half of the popular vaudeville and film stars the Marx Brothers, were approached to appear in a comedy show. Harpo and Zeppo were not required, as Harpo's trademark shticks did not work well on radio, and Zeppo was on the verge of leaving the act. Before this decision was officially reached, early drafts of the scripts featured guest appearances written for both absent brothers, with Harpo being represented through honks of his horn and other trademark sound effects.\n\nNat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman, who had contributed to the scripts of the Marx Brothers' films \"Monkey Business\" (1931) and \"Horse Feathers\" (1932), were enlisted to write the comedy show. It was titled \"Beagle, Shyster, and Beagle\", and its premise involved an unethical lawyer/private detective and his bungling assistant.\n\nGroucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, the same name as the Italian character he played in the film \"Animal Crackers\" (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for \"Fire Chief\". In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. Harpo Marx was paid as a cast member, although the physical, silent nature of his comedy meant that it was impossible to give him an on-air role without forcing him to break character.\n\n\"Five-Star Theater\" was broadcast from NBC's flagship station, WJZ in New York City. Because Groucho, Chico, Perrin, and Sheekman were living and working in Hollywood, they had to make a three-day train journey from Pasadena each week, and then another three-day trip back. The first episode was written as they took their first train ride to New York.\n\nA number of \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\"s scripts reused plots from Marx Brothers films. The plot of Episode 17 was suggested by the stolen painting plot in \"Animal Crackers\", though it was a \"Beauregard\" in the film, not a Rembrandt. The 23rd episode also reused scenes from \"Animal Crackers\", including the stolen diamond plot and Groucho's lines regarding the need for a seven-cent nickel. \"Monkey Business\" influenced two skits in Episode 25, and \"The Cocoanuts\" gave Episode 19 its plot. Episode 26, \"The Ocean Cruise\", lifted some scenes virtually unchanged from the Marx Brothers' film \"Animal Crackers\". Vaudeville acts of the 1920s typically based their stage routines on the assumption that all audiences were heterosexual; some episodes of \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" accordingly included relatively low-key homosexual jokes taken from the Marx Brothers' stage act.\n\nDespite reusing some scripts from other sources, Perrin said that he and Sheekman \"had hands full turning out a script each week\". They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, \" was in the men's room during a break, and he was complaining to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, I wish we could find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George \"did\" make life easier, although Arthur and I went over their scripts for a light polishing.\"\n\nAfter traveling to New York to perform the first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC did not have a studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding chairs were brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared out at the end of each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.\n\nChico was often late for rehearsals, so Perrin would have to stand in for him on the read-throughs. When Chico eventually made his appearance, Perrin remembers, \"he'd be reading Ravelli's lines and Groucho would tell him to stop 'show him how the line should be read'. My Italian accent was better than Chico's, you see. But Chico didn't care.\"\n\n\"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" aired Monday nights at 7:30 p.m. on the NBC Blue Network to thirteen network affiliates in nine Eastern and Southern states. Twenty-six episodes were made, which were broadcast between November 28, 1932 and May 22, 1933. Each episode is introduced by the Blue Network announcer and features about fifteen minutes of drama and ten minutes of orchestral music between acts. The episodes end with Groucho and Chico – not in character, but as themselves – performing a 60-second skit promoting Esso and Essolube.\n\n\"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" was not a success for Standard Oil. Although the successful Marx films \"Monkey Business\" and \"Horse Feathers\" contained plots involving adultery, \"Variety\" did not appreciate them in the radio show:\n\nDespite the content, Groucho's 13-year-old son Arthur found the show \"extremely funny\", albeit conceding that he may have been \"a very easy audience\".\n\nFollowing the airing of the first episodes, a New York attorney named Morris Beagle filed a lawsuit for $300,000 alleging his name had been slandered, and that its use was damaging his business and his health. He also claimed that people were calling his law firm and asking, \"Is this Mr. Beagle?\" When he answered, \"Yes\", the callers would say, \"How's your partner, Shyster?\" and hang up the phone. The sponsors and studio executives panicked, and from episode four the title of the show was changed to \"\"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\"\", and Walter T. Beagle was renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel. It was explained in the episode that the character had divorced and reverted to his \"maiden name\".\n\nThe CAB Rating for the show was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening programs of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as \"The Shadow\" and \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" did not perform as well – but it was less than half of Texaco's \"Fire Chief\", which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be because of the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00 p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00 p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, \"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\", Jack Pearl's \"Baron Münchhausen\", and \"Fire Chief\" all aired after 9:00 p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and \"Five-Star Theater\" was not renewed for a second season.\n\nIn his 1959 autobiography, \"Groucho and Me\", Groucho comments, \"We thought we were doing pretty well as comic lawyers, but one day a few Middle East countries decided they wanted a bigger cut of the oil profits, or else. When this news broke, the price of gasoline nervously dropped two cents a gallon, and Chico and I, along with the other shows, were dropped from the network.\" In his 1976 book, \"The Secret Word Is Groucho\", he writes, \"Company sales, as a result of our show, had risen precipitously. Profits doubled in that brief time, and Esso felt guilty taking the money. So Esso dropped us after twenty-six weeks. Those were the days of guilt-edged securities, which don't exist today.\"\n\nHowever, the show was later praised by other comedians of the time. In 1988, Steve Allen said, \"when judged in relation to other radio comedy scripts of the early 30s, they hold up very well indeed and are, in fact, superior to the material that was produced for the Eddie Cantor, Rudy Vallee, Joe Penner school. The rapid-fire jokes run the gamut from delightful to embarrassing.\" George Burns also found it \"funny\". Modern reviews of \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" have also been positive. \"The New York Times\" Herbert Mitgang described it as \"one of the funniest radio shows of the early 1930s\", adding that \"the radio dialogue was so witty and outrageous, innocent form of original comedy – as well as serious drama\". Rob White of the British Film Institute said the show \"glitter[s] with a thousand-and-one sockeroos.\"\n\nThe episodes of \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" were recorded, but for many years it was thought the recordings had not been preserved. At the time of the broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware that they still existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" had fallen into the public domain. The scripts were published that same year by Pantheon in a book titled \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show\", edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, \"Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel\" scenes were broadcast for the first time since the show went off the air in 1933 when National Public Radio, a non-profit media organization that provides content to public radio stations around the United States, aired an 18-minute recreation of \"Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel\" in markets such as Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, using Washington, D.C.-based Arena Stage actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\" were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005.\n\nIn 1990 the British Broadcasting Corporation's Radio 4 aired a version of \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\". Michael Roberts and Frank Lazarus performed the lead roles of Flywheel and Ravelli, wearing make-up and clothing similar to Groucho and Chico. The regular cast also included Lorelei King in all the female roles, Graham Hoadly as many of the other male characters and guest-starred Spike Milligan and Dick Vosburgh. The scripts for the BBC series were adapted for a modern British audience by Mark Brisenden and were produced and directed by Dirk Maggs. Each episode incorporated material from two or three different original episodes, and occasionally included additional jokes from Marx Brothers' films.\n\nCommenting on the series, Maggs has said it was his favorite among the comedies he had directed, and described how they were performed.\n\nSix episodes were performed and recorded at the Paris Theatre and aired weekly between June 2 and July 7, 1990. The success of the first series led to another two being commissioned. The second series aired from May 11 to June 15, 1991, and the third from July 11 to August 15, 1992. The first series was made available by BBC Enterprises on a two-cassette release in 1991, but the second and third series were not.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1976132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976132", "title": "The Linq", "text": "The Linq\n\nThe Linq (formerly Flamingo Capri, Imperial Palace and The Quad) is a 2,640-room hotel, casino and shopping promenade on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. As of 2012, the casino is with 830 slot machines, 55 table games, and a race and sports book.\n\nIt originally opened in 1959 as the 180-room Flamingo Capri motel, located adjacent to the Flamingo hotel and casino. Ralph Engelstad purchased the property in 1971, and added a casino the following year. In 1977, the hotel had 650 rooms, after the completion of its Imperial Palace Tower. The resort was later reopened as the Asian-themed Imperial Palace in 1979.\n\nSeveral additional hotel towers were added during the 1980s, bringing the resort's room count to an ultimate total of 2,637, after the completion of a fifth and final hotel tower in 1987. At the time of Engelstad's death in 2002, the resort had 2,600 employees and was the second-largest privately owned hotel in the world. In 2012, the resort was renamed as The Quad. The resort was renamed again as The Linq in 2014, after a $223 million renovation.\n\nThe property began as the $2 million, 180-room Flamingo Capri motel, owned by George E. Goldberg and Bill Capri. The motel was built directly north of the Flamingo Hotel and Casino, where Capri was an employee. The motel began construction in May 1959, with a planned completion date of August 15, 1959. Douglas Honnold and John Rex, both of Beverly Hills, California, were the architects. Maurice N. Aroff of Beverly Hills was the general contractor. The Flamingo Capri opened in 1959. The original Flamingo agreed to provide hotel services to guests at the Capri.\n\nRalph Engelstad purchased the motel in 1971, and added a casino in 1972. Prior to the addition of a casino, the motel had 250 employees. In 1973, four motel buildings from the Flamingo Capri were relocated and converted to become part of Engelstad's other property, the Kona Kai motel. Engelstad's construction company added a three-story wing at the east end of the motel, as well as a northern addition, both of which opened in 1974 along with the Shangri-la pool.\n\nBy 1976, the motel was being operated as part of the Best Western hotel chain, while retaining the Flamingo Capri name. The new Imperial Palace Tower, which raised the number of rooms from 300 to 650, was completed in July 1977.\n\nThe property re-opened as the Asian-themed Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino on November 1, 1979, with the number of employees increasing to 1,000. Merlin J. Barth was the architect of the resort, which was themed after an Asian palace. Engelstad chose the Oriental theme, and Barth chose blue tile imported from Japan for the roof of the resort, having been influenced by Japanese temples. The interior heavily featured the Oriental theme as well, and included carved dragons and giant wind chime chandeliers.\n\nAt the time of opening, the resort included Court of a Thousand Treasures, a four-story shopping arcade with 60 stores, overlooking the east end of the casino. The Imperial Theatre showroom with 850 seats was opened in June 1980. In addition to live shows, the showroom was also expanded to be used for filming of sports and entertainment television specials. A second hotel tower with 850 rooms was added in early 1981. The Auto Collections opened on December 1, 1981, on the fifth floor of a new parking garage which was added that year. A 650-room hotel tower opened in August 1982, bringing the total room count to more than 1,500. By 1982, the shopping arcade included the free Imperial Palace School of Gaming, for gamblers who did not know how to play. The school operated as a mini casino overlooking the main casino. During the 1980s, the resort served as the starting and finishing location of the annual Imperial Palace Antique Auto Run.\n\nIn 1984, a couple from Missouri were assaulted in their guest room by a man dressed as a hotel employee. They were beaten, bound and gagged, and the wife was raped. The assailant was never caught. The couple sued the Imperial Palace, claiming that the hotel did not provide adequate security. The lawsuit lasted until at least 1989, with allegations that hotel employees destroyed evidence relating to their security practices. The case was ultimately settled on undisclosed terms.\n\nThe lawsuit would lead indirectly to more trouble for the casino. In 1988, several employees, angry about being placed on leave as punishment for talking to the plaintiff attorney, began speaking to the Gaming Control Board and local media about two Nazi-themed parties Engelstad had held at the Imperial Palace. The parties were held in Engelstad's so-called \"war room\", which featured a large collection of World War II Nazi memorabilia, including a portrait of Engelstad in the likeness of Hitler. A national controversy ensued. Engelstad claimed the collection was purely of historical interest, and not meant to glorify the Nazis. The Gaming Control Board recommended that Engelstad lose his gaming license and be fined $200,000 for reflecting poorly on the reputation of the Nevada gaming industry. An agreement was ultimately reached whereby Engelstad kept his license, but paid $1.5 million in penalties.\n\nIn 1985, the parking garage was expanded to include more than 1,000 additional parking spaces, becoming one of the largest parking facilities in Las Vegas. In December 1985, the foundation was laid for a 560-room hotel addition, which was completed in 1986 as the resort's fourth tower, bringing the room count total to 2,100. The Imperial Palace became the seventh largest hotel in the world, and had more than 2,200 employees. Also in 1986, the casino was expanded by , and convention facilities were increased from to . A fifth and final hotel tower, standing 19 stories with 547 rooms, was completed in July 1987, bringing the total to 2,637 rooms. The tower was the former location of the resort's pool.\n\nIn 1987, the Governor's Committee for the Handicapped named the Imperial Palace as \"Employer of the Year\" for its extensiving hiring of handicapped people. A three-phase expansion began in August 1987 and concluded in July 1989. The three-phase expansion included the addition of a new Olympic-size swimming pool, a heated spa, and a poolside bar. The final phase of the expansion – including a race & sportsbook, and fitness center – extended the resort to the sidewalk along Las Vegas Boulevard. The sportsbook was completed in September 1989, and a drive-through option was created in 1991, making the Imperial Palace the first casino in Las Vegas to offer such a feature. The drive-through sportsbook, located on Koval Lane behind the hotel, became popular among customers. In 1991, the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities named the Imperial Palace \"National Employer of the Year\" for its hiring of disabled people. In 1993, an independent 24-hour medical facility serving guests and employees was opened. In the 1990s, the Imperial Palace's gaming school operated on the main casino floor. In 1997, Engelstad opened a second Imperial Palace in Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nAs of 1997, the Imperial Palace was the 10th largest hotel in the world and the world's largest privately owned hotel. When Engelstad died in 2002, the casino ownership transferred to the Ralph Engelstad and Betty Engelstad Trust. The casino operated as its own limited partnership, Imperial Palace LLC, under the Trust's oversight. At the time of Engelstad's death, the resort was the second-largest privately owned hotel in the world, with nearly 2,700 rooms and 2,600 employees.\n\nOn August 22, 2005, Harrah's Entertainment announced plans to purchase the property. The acquisition was completed on December 23, 2005. During a conference call with investors on November 20, 2005, the Chairman for Harrah's, Gary Loveman, noted that both the Imperial Palace and neighboring O'Sheas Casino \"are going to require very substantial modifications or complete tear-downs and rebuilds\" in order to make room for an expansion of the nearby Harrah's and/or Flamingo hotel-casinos. However, since then, Harrah's has invested millions of dollars into refurbishing both the hotel rooms and the casino itself.\n\nIn July 2009, Harrah's announced new plans for the area around the Imperial Palace, O'Sheas, and Flamingo casinos, confirming that the Imperial Palace will not be demolished at this time. Harrah's planned to add approximately 20 restaurants and bars between O'Sheas and the Flamingo.\n\nIn August 2011, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced it will be building a massive entertainment complex adjacent to the Imperial Palace and on the site of O'Sheas casino, called Project LINQ. The Imperial Palace name will be retired and the property renamed.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced that Imperial Palace would be renamed The Quad Resort and Casino. The official conversion was completed on December 21, 2012.\n\nIn July 2014, Caesars announced that the Quad would be again renamed The Linq Hotel & Casino in order to join the LINQ Promenade, an adjacent shopping and entertainment center that opened in January 2014, following a $223 million renovation of the property. The hotel and casino were officially renamed on October 30, 2014.\n\n\nThe Linq Promenade is an open-air retail, dining, and entertainment district located between The Linq and Flamingo resorts that began a soft open in January 2014.\n\nIn November 2017, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced the intended addition of Fly LINQ, expected to be the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip. Construction of the $20 million zipline was underway in April 2018. The Fly LINQ attraction features 10 side-by-side zip lines. Fly Linq opened at The Linq Promenade on November 9, 2018.\n\nOn March 31, 2014, Caesars Entertainment opened the 550-foot-tall High Roller, The World's Tallest Observation Wheel at The LINQ Promenade.\n\nO'Sheas Casino reopened in December 2013, attached to the Linq's casino floor and to its shopping promenade.\n\nThe Auto Collections was a collection of classic vehicles on display at the resort until 2017. The museum opened on December 1, 1981, known then as the Antique and Classic Auto Collections. The museum initially consisted of Engelstad's own private car collection, worth over $10 million at the time of the opening. The exhibition was located in an air-conditioned facility on the 5th floor of the resort's parking garage.\n\nDon Williams and Richie Clyne took over operations of the museum in 1999. Under their management, the museum began offering its vehicles for sale and trade on February 1, 2000. Approximately 200 vehicles were kept in storage nearby. Vehicles would be taken out of storage to take the place of those that had been sold in the exhibit. Approximately half of the vehicles in the collection were owned by Williams and Clyne. The Auto Collections closed on December 30, 2017. Rob Williams, the general manager and a part-owner, said about the closure, \"It's time; it's basically that simple. We've had a great run here … It's just time to close it down and move on to our next endeavors.\" Although visitor attendance had slightly declined, it was not a reason for the closure.\n\nThe exhibit was located in of space. The collection was the world's largest classic car showroom, with more than $25 million worth of inventory on display and for sale. More than 250 antique, classic, muscle and historically significant cars were on display and nearly all were for sale. Prices varied dramatically depending on many factors and ranged from as low as $30,000 to several million dollars for the especially rare pieces in the collection. Some of the cars presented included those once driven by famous celebrities or utilized by state officials, such as the 1955 Lincoln Capri Convertible owned by Marilyn Monroe, the 1939 Chrysler Royal Sedan formerly belonging to Johnny Carson or the 1962 Lincoln Continental Towne Limousine serving President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"Mat Franco - Magic Reinvented Nightly\" stars Mat Franco, the season nine winner on NBC's \"America's Got Talent\". In the newly renovated \"Mat Franco Theater\", Franco performs multiple tricks involving audience participation, as well as his awarding winning sleight-of-hand. In 2016 Magic Reinvented Nightly was awarded \"Best Show\" and \"Best Magic Show\" by \"Las Vegas Weekly\" and the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" respectively.\n\n\"Frank Marino's Divas Las Vegas\" was a drag revue starring Las Vegas' longest-running headliner, Frank Marino, who hosted the revue as his most famous impersonation, Joan Rivers. The show moved to the Imperial Palace from the Riviera Hotel and Casino in 2010, and ran for eight years, until it was shut down in July 2018 due to controversy involving a charity scandal.\n\nBeginning in 2003, the casino had approximately eight blackjack tables on the lower level that featured celebrity impersonators as dealers. These impersonators, which included Joliet Jake from the Blues Brothers, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Cher, Shakira, Roy Orbison, Zac Brown, Shania Twain, Britney Spears, Buddy Holly, and others, alternated dealing cards and performing a song on a small stage in the center of the tables. The Dealertainers pit was discontinued as of September 8, 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1976133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976133", "title": "Pakesley, Ontario", "text": "Pakesley, Ontario\n\nPakesley is a ghost town in the Parry Sound District of Ontario, located on the Bolton to Sudbury line of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Mowat Township. It is named for the Pakeskag River, that drains the local area north to the Pickerel River. Formerly a station and passing track on the CPR, this portion of the line from Bala to Sudbury was opened to traffic June 15, 1908.\n\nFrom this point, Lauder, Spears and Howland, built a logging railway to their sawmill at Lost Channel in 1917. Owing to financial difficulties, the Key Valley Railway and the sawmill at Lost Channel was taken over by the Schroeder Mills & Timber Company, for whom James Lauder, Joseph Spears and L. B. Howland, had originally contracted to do.\n\nAt Pakesley, a lumber storage yard was established. The wood was stacked with spaces between the boards to allow air drying of the lumber, for 3 months to a year before it could be shipped. The lumber yard was said to have almost seven miles of railway siding.\n\nAt the site a post office, store, hotel, restaurant and an Ontario Department of Lands and Forests fire headquarters was erected. This was a watchtower and rangers station.\n\nThe original railway station was an old wooden box car, removed from its wheels and set on blocks near the tracks. As business grew, this was replaced with a two-story railway station also of wood construction, where the agent and his family slept. By 1924, the population stood at approximately 150 people. As there were more travellers, the CPR expanded their facility to a seven-room train station.\n\nIn addition, three boarding houses, two office buildings, stables and a warehouse were built. Not all workers lived in the boarding houses. Some workers built homes near the railway for their families. For the children, a school was built.\n\nLike many one industry towns, it was boom and bust. When the pine was all gone, Schroeder, Mills & Timber Co. sold the Lost Channel mill to James Playfair & Co. of Midland. The operations continued, under the name Pakesley Lumber Company, producing hardwood lumber. Schroeder continued to operate the railway for the new firm, however, when fire destroyed the original Lost Channel sawmill in 1928, the flames quick spread to the adjacent engine house, taking with it two of the locomotives. A new smaller sawmill was constructed, which continued production during the depression.\n\nWith more than 40,000,000 feet of seasoned lumber stockpiled at Pakesley in 1933, all operations of the lumber company and the railway ceased. The lumber was disposed of and the rails of the Key Valley Railway were lifted by 1935 and the sawmill was removed by 1938. There are four original buildings remaining today, including the old school house and three homes which are still used as hunting camps and cottages. It is located on Highway 522, east of Highway 69.\n\n"}
{"id": "1976135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976135", "title": "Canol Road", "text": "Canol Road\n\nThe Canol Road was part of a project to build the Canol pipeline and a road from Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, to Whitehorse, Yukon, during World War II. The pipeline no longer exists, but the long Yukon portion of the road is maintained by the Yukon Government during summer months. The portion of the road that still exists in the NWT is called the Canol Heritage Trail. Both road and trail are incorporated into the Trans-Canada Trail.\n\nThe Canol Road starts at Johnson's Crossing on the Alaska Highway near the Teslin River bridge, east of Whitehorse, Yukon, and runs to the Northwest Territories border. The highway joins the Robert Campbell Highway near Ross River, Yukon, where there is a cable ferry across the Pelly River, and an old footbridge, still in use, that once supported the pipeline.\n\nConstruction and development of the Alaska Highway and airfields along the Northwest Staging Route and provision of military bases in Alaska led to a determination that a source of fuel was required. High-grade oil was available at Norman Wells, and the scheme was to construct a pipeline to Whitehorse.\n\nAssorted components, including pieces from Texas, were moved to Whitehorse to construct a refinery. A road was built to provide access to build and service the pipeline.\n\nAt first, the effort was to move all construction activity for the pipeline and road to Norman Wells from northeastern Alberta. This required the use of winter roads and river movement, including several portages around rapids, and was soon found to be cumbersome, slow, and a bottleneck. Ultimately, construction proceeded both from \"Canol Camp\" (across the Mackenzie River from Norman Wells) and Whitehorse, and the roadway was joined in the vicinity of the Macmillan Pass in the Mackenzie Mountains, on the Yukon–Northwest Territories border, December 31, 1943.\n\nThe 4 inch (101.6 mm) pipeline was laid directly on the ground, and the high grade of the oil allowed it to flow even at . Workers on the road and pipeline had to endure mosquitoes, black flies, extreme cold and other difficult conditions. One poster for the company that hired workers warned that the conditions could be life-threatening; emphasising that if people were not willing to endure the conditions, they should not apply for the work.\n\nThe oil flow commenced in 1944, but was shut down April 1, 1945, having not performed entirely satisfactorily. Some supplementary pipelines were installed to distribute product from the Whitehorse refinery, which also closed in 1945. Twelve tankers-full of oil were delivered to Alaska annually in spite of the perceived threat from Japanese occupation of the Aleutians, while Canol only provided the equivalent of one tanker-full.\n\nSome of the supplementary pipelines remained active into the 1990s, although the line to Skagway, Alaska, had its flow reversed, and it was used by the White Pass and Yukon Route railway to move petroleum products into the Yukon.\n\nPortions of the primary pipeline between Whitehorse and Canol was later removed and sold for use elsewhere. The refinery was purchased in early 1948 by Imperial Oil, dismantled, and trucked to Alberta for the Leduc oil strike.\n\nThe roadway is the surviving legacy of the Canol project. Although abandoned in 1946–1947, the southernmost was reopened in 1958 to connect Ross River, Yukon, with the Alaska Highway. A molybdenum mine briefly operated along this part of the route in the late 1950s.\nThe next 130 miles (209 km) from Ross River to the Northwest Territories border was reopened in 1972, and soon after, mining exploration companies used the route to reach into the N.W.T., including the use of washed-out, bridgeless roadway to scout for minerals, although none beyond the border have been developed. A barite mine has operated near the north end of the Yukon section.\n\nThe highway was designated as Yukon Highway 8 until 1978, when it became Yukon Highway 6.\n\nThe Yukon section of the road is little changed from 1945, although culverts have replaced some of the original one-lane bridges, and several one-lane Bailey bridges remain. There are very few two-lane bridges on the road. Many are marked with a sign indicating differing vehicle weight limits above and below −35 °C (−32 °F), seemingly redundant since the road is closed in winter, when such temperatures would happen.\n\nIt is a winding, hilly road, resembling the original Alaska Highway (which has since been substantially upgraded); the road is not recommended for RVs, and traffic is very light. Occasionally, the road's alignment is emphasized with signs that show the symbol for winding road. There are few guardrails, and other than a government campground, no facilities except at Ross River.\nFormer Yukon Member of Parliament Erik Nielsen owned a cabin for a retreat at Quiet Lake, and at party meetings, some people showed up with signs identifying themselves as delegates for Quiet Lake. Quiet Lake was the location of a small boat used by military officers for recreation during the war; that boat is now at the Transportation Museum in Whitehorse.\n\nCanadian folk singer Stan Rogers wrote and performed a song called \"Canol Road\" which names several settlements in the area.\n\nMile Zero of the Canol Road was located at Norman Wells where vehicles drove across the ice in the winter. From the banks of the Mackenzie River (Milepost 4) the road extends southwest to the Yukon border. The main site of project administration and operations, including a large airfield, was at Camp Canol (Milepost 8).\n\nThe Canol Road is not maintained in the Northwest Territories and all bridges are gone. The road remains passable for some distance past the border depending on the capabilities of the vehicle. Vehicles commonly drive as far as the airstrip and buildings located at Milepost 222. \n\nThe prospect of the Northwest Territories portion being repaired for automobile use is unlikely. It is an extremely difficult route in sections and the road condition has badly deteriorated. If the demand existed for a road between Ross River and the Sahtu region, it would make more sense to build along an entirely new route that was actually recommended in 1942 by the First Nations member who was called upon to locate a route. Such a route would emerge from the mountains opposite Tulita, Northwest Territories.\n\nThe of Canol Road between Milepost 222 and the Mackenzie River is now the Canol Heritage Trail and traveled by hiking and mountain biking. \n\nClean up of the Northwest Territories section has been underway since 2007 to remove old telegraph wire, remove hazardous materials and demolish or board up old buildings.. When remediation is complete it will allow the creation of a territorial park to proceed as set out in the \"Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1976138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976138", "title": "Kurt Lewin", "text": "Kurt Lewin\n\nKurt Lewin ( ; 9 September 1890 – 12 February 1947) was a German-American psychologist, known as one of the modern pioneers of social, organizational, and applied psychology in the United States. Exiled from the land of his birth, Lewin made a new life for himself, in which he defined himself and his contributions within three lenses of analysis: applied research, action research, and group communication were his major offerings to the field of communication.\n\nLewin is often recognized as the \"founder of social psychology\" and was one of the first to study group dynamics and organizational development. A \"Review of General Psychology\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Lewin as the 18th-most cited psychologist of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1890, Lewin was born into a Jewish family in Mogilno, County of Mogilno, Province of Poznań, Prussia (modern Poland). It was a small village of about 5,000 people, about 150 of whom were Jewish. Lewin received an orthodox Jewish education at home. He was one of four children born into a middle-class family. His father owned a small general store, and the family lived in an apartment above the store. His father, Leopold, owned a farm jointly with his brother Max; however, the farm was legally owned by a Christian because Jews were unable to own farms at the time.\n\nThe family moved to Berlin in 1905, so Lewin and his brothers could receive a better education. From 1905 to 1908, Lewin studied at the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium, where he received a classical humanistic education. In 1909, he entered the University of Freiburg to study medicine, but transferred to University of Munich to study biology. He became involved with the socialist movement and women's rights around this time. In April 1910, he transferred to the Royal Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin, where he was still a medical student. By the Easter semester of 1911, his interests had shifted toward philosophy. By the summer of 1911, the majority of his courses were in psychology. While at the University of Berlin, Lewin took 14 courses with Carl Stumpf (1848–1936).\n\nHe served in the German army when World War I began. Due to a war wound, he returned to the University of Berlin to complete his PhD. Lewin wrote a dissertation proposal asking Stumpf to be his supervisor, and Stumpf assented. Even though Lewin worked under Stumpf to complete his dissertation, their relationship did not involve much communication. Lewin studied associations, will, and intention for his dissertation, but he did not discuss it with Stumpf until his final doctoral examination.\n\nIn 1917, Lewin married Maria Landsberg. In 1919, the couple welcomed their daughter Esther Agnes, and in 1922, their son Fritz Reuven was born. They divorced around 1927, and Maria immigrated to Palestine with the children. In 1929, Lewin married Gertrud Weiss. Their daughter Miriam was born in 1931, and their son Daniel was born in 1933.\n\nLewin had originally been involved with schools of behavioral psychology before changing directions in research and undertaking work with psychologists of the Gestalt school of psychology, including Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Kohler. He also joined the Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin where he lectured and gave seminars on both philosophy and psychology. He served as a professor at the University of Berlin from 1926 to 1932, during which time he conducted experiments about tension states, needs, motivation, and learning. In 1933, Lewin had tried to negotiate a teaching position as the chair of psychology as well as the creation of a research institute at the Hebrew University. Lewin often associated with the early Frankfurt School, originated by an influential group of largely Jewish Marxists at the Institute for Social Research in Germany. But when Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 the Institute members had to disband, moving to England and then to America. In that year, he met with Eric Trist, of the London Tavistock Clinic. Trist was impressed with his theories and went on to use them in his studies on soldiers during the Second World War.\n\nLewin immigrated to the United States in August 1933 and became a naturalized citizen in 1940. A few years after moving to America, Lewin began asking people to pronounce his name as \"Lou-in\" rather than \"Le-veen\" because the misspelling of his name by Americans had led to many missed phone calls. Earlier, he had spent six months as a visiting professor at Stanford in 1930, but on his immigration to the United States, Lewin worked at Cornell University and for the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station at the University of Iowa. Later, he became director of the Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. While working at MIT in 1946, Lewin received a phone call from the director of the Connecticut State Inter Racial Commission requesting help to find an effective way to combat religious and racial prejudices. He set up a workshop to conduct a \"change\" experiment, which laid the foundations for what is now known as sensitivity training. In 1947, this led to the establishment of the National Training Laboratories, at Bethel, Maine. Carl Rogers believed that sensitivity training is \"perhaps the most significant social invention of this century.\"\n\nFollowing World War II, Lewin was involved in the psychological rehabilitation of former occupants of displaced persons camps with Dr. Jacob Fine at Harvard Medical School. When Trist and A T M Wilson wrote to Lewin proposing a journal in partnership with their newly founded Tavistock Institute and his group at MIT, Lewin agreed. The Tavistock journal, \"Human Relations\", was founded with two early papers by Lewin entitled \"Frontiers in Group Dynamics\". Lewin taught for a time at Duke University.\n\nLewin died in Newtonville, Massachusetts, of a heart attack in 1947. He was buried in his home town. His wife died in 1987.\n\nLewin coined the notion of genidentity, which has gained some importance in various theories of space-time and related fields. For instance, he introduced the concept of hodological space or the simplest route achieved through the resolution of different field of forces, oppositions, and tensions according to their goals. \n\nLewin also proposed Herbert Blumer's interactionist perspective of 1937 as an alternative to the nature versus nurture debate. Lewin suggested that neither nature (inborn tendencies) nor nurture (how experiences in life shape individuals) alone can account for individuals' behavior and personalities, but rather that both nature and nurture interact to shape each person. This idea was presented in the form of Lewin's equation for behavior, \"B\" = \"ƒ\"(\"P\", \"E\").\n\nFirst and foremost, Kurt Lewin was an applied researcher and practical theorist. Most scholars of the time reveled in the fear that devoting oneself to applied research would distract the discipline from basic research on scholarly problems – thus creating this false binary regarding for whom knowledge is created, whether it was for the perpetuation of the discipline or for application. Despite this debate within the social sciences at the time, Lewin argued that \"applied research could be conducted with rigor and that one could test theoretical propositions in applied research.\" The root of this particular binary seemed to stem from the epistemological norms present within the hard sciences – where the distinction was much more pronounced; Kurt Lewin argued that this was contrary to the nature of the social sciences. Furthermore, with the help of scholars like Paul Lazarsfeld, there was a method through which money could be acquired for research in a sustainable manner. Lewin has encouraged researchers to develop theories that can be used to address important social problems.\n\nTo demonstrate his dedication to applied research and to further prove that there was value in testing his theoretical propositions, Lewin became a \"master at transposing an everyday problem into a psychological experiment\". Lewin, in his beginnings, took a seemingly banal moment between himself and a waiter and turned it into the beginnings of his field research. In this particular incident, Lewin reasoned that the \"intention to carry out a specific task builds a psychological tension, which is released when the intended task is completed\" in tandem with when Sigmund Freud theorized that \"wishes persist until they are satisfied.\" This happenstance observation started the demonstration of the \"existence of psychic tensions\", fundamental to Lewin's field theory.\n\nWhile applied research helped develop Lewin into a practical theorist, what further defined him as an academic and a forerunner was his \"action research\" – a term he coined for himself. Lewin was increasingly interested in the concepts of Jewish migration and identity. He was confused by the concept of how while an individual distanced themselves from performing the Jewish identity in terms of religious expression and performance, they were still considered Jewish in the eyes of Nazis. This concept of denying one's identity and the promotion of self-loathing as a form of coping with a dominant group's oppression represented the crisis of Lewin's own migration to the United States. Lewin, as his student and colleague Ron Lippitt described, \"had a deep sensitivity to social problems and a commitment to use his resources as a social scientist to do something about them. Thus in the early 1940s he drew a triangle to represent the interdependence of research, training, and action in producing social change.\" This diagramming of an academic's interests and actions within this triangulation yields an interesting part of accessing Lewin and his contributions. Rather than noting social justice as the beginning or the end, it was ingrained in every single academic action that Lewin took. It was this particular world view and paradigm that furthered his research and determined precisely how he was going to utilize the findings from his field research. Furthermore, it all reflected upon Lewin the man and his way of coping with the events of his time period. This devotion to action research was possibly a way of resolving a dissonance of his own passage to America and how he left his own back in present-day Poland.\n\nProminent psychologists mentored by Lewin included Leon Festinger (1919–1989), who became known for his cognitive dissonance theory (1956), environmental psychologist Roger Barker, Bluma Zeigarnik, and Morton Deutsch, the founder of modern conflict resolution theory and practice.\n\nForce field analysis provides a framework for looking at the factors (\"forces\") that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). Key to this approach was Lewin's interest in gestaltism, understanding the totality and assessing a situation as a whole and not focusing only on individual aspects. Further, the totality for an individual (their life space) derives from their perception of their reality, not an objective viewpoint. The approach, developed by Kurt Lewin, is a significant contribution to the fields of social science, psychology, social psychology, organizational development, process management, and change management. His theory was expanded by John R. P. French who related it to organizational and industrial settings.\n\nLewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term \"action research\" in about 1944, and it appears in his 1946 paper \"Action Research and Minority Problems\". In that paper, he described action research as \"a comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action\" that uses \"a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action\" (this is sometimes referred to as the \"Lewinian spiral\").\n\nLewin often characterized organizational management styles and cultures in terms of leadership climates defined by (1) authoritarian, (2) democratic and (3) laissez-faire work environments. He is often mixed up with McGregor with his work environments, but McGregor adapted them directly to leadership-theory. Authoritarian environments are characterized where the leader determines policy with techniques and steps for work tasks dictated by the leader in the division of labor. The leader is not necessarily hostile but is aloof from participation in work and commonly offers personal praise and criticism for the work done. Democratic climates are characterized where policy is determined through collective processes with decisions assisted by the leader. Before accomplishing tasks, perspectives are gained from group discussion and technical advice from a leader. Members are given choices and collectively decide the division of labor. Praise and criticism in such an environment are objective, fact minded and given by a group member without necessarily having participated extensively in the actual work. Laissez-faire environments give freedom to the group for policy determination without any participation from the leader. The leader remains uninvolved in work decisions unless asked, does not participate in the division of labor, and very infrequently gives praise.\n\nAn early model of change developed by Lewin described change as a three-stage process. The first stage he called \"unfreezing\". It involved overcoming inertia and dismantling the existing \"mind set\". It must be part of surviving. Defense mechanisms have to be bypassed. In the second stage the change occurs. This is typically a period of confusion and transition. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged but we do not have a clear picture as to what we are replacing them with yet. The third and final stage he called \"freezing\". The new mindset is crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels. This is often misquoted as \"refreezing\" (see Lewin,1947). Lewin's three-step process is regarded as a foundational model for making change in organizations. There is now evidence, however, that Lewin never developed such a model and that it took form after his death in 1947.\n\nLewin's equation, \"B\" = \"ƒ\"(\"P\", \"E\"), is a psychological equation of behavior developed by Kurt Lewin. It states that behavior is a function of the person in their environment.\n\nThe equation is the psychologist's most well known formula in social psychology, of which Lewin was a modern pioneer. When first presented in Lewin's book \"Principles of Topological Psychology\", published in 1936, it contradicted most popular theories in that it gave importance to a person's momentary situation in understanding his or her behavior, rather than relying entirely on the past.\n\nIn a 1947 article, Lewin coined the term \"group dynamics\". He described this notion as the way that groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances. This field emerged as a concept dedicated to the advancement of knowledge regarding the nature of groups, their laws, establishment, development, and interactions with other groups, individuals and institutions. During the early years of research on group processes, many psychologists rejected the reality of group phenomena. Critics shared the opinion that groups did not exist as scientifically valid entities. It had been said by skeptics that the actions of groups were nothing more than those of its members considered separately. Lewin applied his interactionism formula, \"B\" = \"ƒ\"(\"P\", \"E\"), to explain group phenomena, where a member's personal characteristics (\"P\") interact with the environmental factors of the group, (\"E\") its members, and the situation to elicit behaviour (\"B\"). Given his background in Gestalt psychology, Lewin justified group existence using the dictum \"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". He theorized that when a group is established it becomes a unified system with supervening qualities that cannot be understood by evaluating members individually. This notion – that a group is composed of more than the sum of its individual members – quickly gained support from sociologists and psychologists who understood the significance of this emerging field. Many pioneers noted that the majority of group phenomena could be explained according to Lewin's equation and insight and opposing views were hushed. The study of group dynamics remains relevant in today's society where a vast number of professions (e.g., business and industry, clinical/counseling psychology, sports and recreation) rely on its mechanisms to thrive.\n\nThe most notable of Lewin's contributions was his development of group communication and group dynamics as major facets of the communication discipline. Lewin and his associated researchers shifted from the pre-existing trend of individualist psychology and then expanded their work to incorporate a macro lens where they focused on the \"social psychology of small group communication\" (Rogers 1994). Lewin is associated with \"founding research and training in group dynamics and for establishing the participative management style in organizations\". He carved out this niche for himself from his various experiments. In his Berlin research, Lewin utilized \"group discussions to advance his theory in research.\" In doing so, there was certainly the complication of not knowing exactly whom to attribute epiphanies to as an idea collectively came into fruition. In addition to group discussions, he became increasingly interested in group membership. He was curious as to how perspectives of an individual in relation to the group were solidified or weakened. He tried to come up with the way identity was constructed from standpoint and perspectives. These were the beginnings of what ended up developing into \"groupthink\". Lewin started to become quite interested in how ideas were created and then perpetuated by the mentality of a group. Not included in this chapter is how important this became in looking at group dynamics across disciplines – including studying John F Kennedy and the way he tried to interact with his advisors in order to prevent groupthink from occurring.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1976141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976141", "title": "Allegheny Observatory", "text": "Allegheny Observatory\n\nThe Allegheny Observatory is an American astronomical research institution, a part of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh. The facility is listed on the National Register of Historical Places (ref. # 79002157, added June 22, 1979) and is designated as a Pennsylvania state and Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation historic landmark.\n\nThe observatory was founded on February 15, 1859, in the city of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (incorporated into the City of Pittsburgh in 1907) by a group of wealthy industrialists calling themselves the Allegheny Telescope Association. The observatory's initial purpose was for general public education as opposed to research, but by 1867 the revenues derived from this had receded. The facility was then donated to the Western University of Pennsylvania, today known as the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe University hired Samuel Pierpont Langley to be the first director. One of the research programs initiated under his leadership was of sunspots. He drew very detailed drawings of sunspots which are still used in astronomical textbooks to this day. He also had the building expanded to include dark rooms, class rooms, dormitories, and a lecture hall.\n\nIn 1869, Langley created income for observatory by selling subscription service to time that was accurately determined by astronomical measurements and transmitted over telegraphs to customers. The Pennsylvania Railroad was the most influential subscriber to the \"Allegheny Time\" system. The Allegheny Observatory's service is believed to have been the first regular and systematic system of time distribution to railroads and cities as well as the origin of the modern standard time system. By 1870, the Allegheny Time service extended over 2,500 miles with 300 telegraph offices receiving time signals.\nOn November 18, 1883, the first day of railroad standard time in North America, the Allegheny Observatory transmitted a signal on telegraph lines operated by railroads in Canada and the United States. The signal marked noon, Eastern Standard Time, and railroads across the continent synchronized their schedules based on this signal. The standard time that began on this day continues in North American use to this day.\n\nThe revenues from the sale of time signals covered Langley's salary and the bills. Allegheny Observatory continued to supply time signals until the US Naval Observatory started offering it for free in 1920.\n\nMore recently George Gatewood began using the Allegheny Observatory to search for extrasolar planets as well as to follow up on claims of extrasolar planets, starting in 1972. This is done using astrometry, which is the practice of measuring the position of stars. In addition to studying the positions of stars on the thousands of photographic plates in the vaults of the observatory, George Gatewood also designed the Multichannel Astrometric Photometer (MAP) for use with the Thaw telescope to measure the position of a target star and its close neighbors on images taken 6 months apart. This technique takes advantage of parallax. If the target star has a companion then it will wobble due to the gravitational pull of the unseen companion. The size of the companion can be measured by the size of the wobble.\n\nMAP is no longer in use and the Thaw telescope is in the process of rewiring and upgrading.\n\nA model of the original observatory can be found in the Miniature Railroad & Village exhibit at Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and in 2012 a documentary film was released covering the observatory's history.\n\nLangley was the director when he returned home in Allegheny City on July 8, 1872, following a conference. Observatory staff advised him that the lens of the 13 inch Fitz Telescope had been taken for ransom which Langley refused to pay; an argument with the unknown lens-napper ensued without resolve. It has been speculated that Langley knew the identity of the lens-napper, his or her identity is still a mystery. The lens-napper thought that with the involvement of the newspapers investigating the incidents his identity may be discovered so told Langley he could have back the lens. No clue was given as to its location but it was eventually found in a Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, hotel wastepaper basket. It being scratched made it useless so it was re-ground by lens maker Alvan Clark. When it was reinstalled the clarity was improved so the lens-napping benefited the observatory. In gratitude, Langley added Clark's name to the telescope.\n\nLangley also researched heavier-than-air flight behind the observatory. To study the aerodynamic behavior of different forms traveling at high speeds he built a large spring \"whirling arm\" to which stuffed birds and wings he made were attached. After leaving Allegheny Observatory to become secretary of the Smithsonian in 1888, he continued his flight research, designing and flying the first, unmanned, aircraft capable of stable continuously powered flight from a houseboat on the Potomac River. His full-size manned Aerodrome was funded by the U.S. Army. Two well-publicized crashes of the Aerodrome in 1903 ended his flight research.\n\nThe original observatory building was replaced by the current structure, shown in the photograph above. It was designed in the Classic Revival style by Thorsten E. Billquist. The cornerstone was laid in 1900, and the new structure was completed in 1912. It is located four miles north of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at Riverview Park. The building is a tan brick and white terra cotta hilltop temple whose Classical forms and decoration symbolize the unity of art and science. The L-shaped building consists of a library, lecture hall, classrooms, laboratories, offices, and three hemispherical domed telescope enclosures. Two were reserved for research; one for use by schools and the general public.\nThe core of the building is a small rotunda, housing an opalescent glass window depicting the Greek muse of astronomy, Urania, designed by artist Mary Elizabeth Tillinghast. A crypt in the basement of the observatory holds the ashes of two eminent astronomers and former directors of the Allegheny Observatory, James Edward Keeler and John Brashear. In addition, the crypt holds the remains of Brashear's wife Phoebe and Keeler's wife Cora Matthews Keeler and son Henry Bowman Keeler.\n\nThe original observatory building was converted into an athletics training facility 1907 and used by the university's football team. The original observatory building was sold, along with the rest of the adjacent university buildings, to the Protestant Orphan Asylum prior to the move of the main academic portion of the university to the Oakland section of Pittsburgh in 1909. The original observatory building was torn down in the 1950s and the site is now occupied by Triangle Tech.\n\nThe main active research pursuit at the Allegheny Observatory involves detections of extrasolar planets. This is done using photometry, which is the practice of measuring the brightness of stars. The brightness of a target star and its close neighbors are measured on digital images taken every 30–60 seconds, and if a planet crosses (transits) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed visual brightness of the star drops a small amount. The amount the star dims depends on the relative sizes of the star and the planet. The research team consists of students at the University of Pittsburgh whose observations have recently contributed to a collaborative effort to observe a transit of the planet HD 80606 b. The group is also actively contributing to upgrading the Allegheny Observatory. \nIn 2009, the university's Department of Geology and Planetary Science installed Western Pennsylvania's only seismic station, which is connected to IRIS Consortium networks, in the observatory.\n\nWhen the new Allegheny Observatory was designed it was done with the public in mind; the floor plan included a lecture hall. When the new facility first went into operation, on every clear evening it was opened for the public to look through the 13\" telescope but if it were a cloudy night \"they would be given an illustrated lecture on astronomy.\" John Brashear once said \"the Allegheny observatory would remain forever free to the people\" and to this day it has although in modern times the free public tours are only offered a couple nights each week.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n"}

In the spring of 1917, they built a large sawmill on Kawigamog Lake, a widening of the Pickerel River. The firm intended to transport the lumber with horses, along a rough road to Pakesley, on the CPR, 10½ miles to the west.\n\nInitially, Messrs. Lauder, Spears and Howland, had established their operation in 1913 at Palmer's mill, on the CNR at Mowat, after John Schroeder had acquired standing timber in the townships of Mowat and Blair. Another mill near Mowat, was Cole's, up on Key Lake, some twelve miles (19 km) from the railway.\n\nIn the Summer of 1913, Schroeder made arrangements for logging in the townships of Wilson, Ferrie and Brown. He then contracted James Ludgate to take out the timber. Ludgate made his headquarters at Salines, later known as Drocourt. It was not until the autumn of 1916 that Schroeder Mills & Timber Co. purchased outright, the of timber berths in Mowat and Blair, from the Victoria Harbour Lumber Co. It was following this purchase, that Lauder, Spears and Howland began construction of the new mill at Lost Channel.\n\nAfter the mill was completed, Mr. Howland persuaded his partners to build a railway, to carry the sawn lumber to the CPR at Pakesley, although James Lauder and Joseph Spears thought the operation would run just as well without that additional expense. Lucien B. Howland was the former General Manager of the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway, built by his father-in-law, the late Charles J. Pusey. The relationship of these three men can be traced back to 1909, when Lauder and Spears, leased the mill of the Wilberforce Lumber Company, at Wilberforce a station on the IB&O.\n\nThe first locomotive on the Key Valley Railway, from Pakesley to Lost Channel, was CNR 4-4-0 #50, (formerly IB&O #3), acquired from Canadian Northern in 1917. Arrangements were made to purchase a second locomotive from Canadian Northern, also of the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, former Central Ontario Railway #39.\n\nBefore the railway was completed, however, Lauder Spears and Howland were experiencing financial difficulties. It seems the railway cost several times more to build than had been estimated. When they applied to the bank for additional funds to complete the project, a representative was sent up to make a report on the situation.\n\nThe bank representative was impressed after examining the whole operation, and advised the partners his report would be favourable, and would definitely recommend that their line of credit be extended. During the long wait for the southbound train at Pakesley, an executive of Schroeder Mills & Timber Co. advised the banker that his company would assume responsibility for the loan, if in turn the bank would transfer to them all of Lauder, Spears and Howland's assets, held by the bank as collateral. A few days later the bank informed Lauder, Spears and Howland that their line of credit would not be extended. In addition they were ordered to repay a sizeable portion of their bank loan within 30 days. The partners tried frantically to raise enough money to satisfy the bank. Unable to do so, Lauder, Spears and Howland, were swept aside - ruined men.\n\nSchroeder Mills & Timber Co. subsequently took over the sawmill and the railway, promoting James Ludgate as manager. In addition to the mill and railway, Lost Channel grew to contain a bunkhouse, cookery, hospital, school and single dwellings for the workmen.\n\nThe Key Valley Railway was more than a logging railway as it carried mostly lumber from the mill, out to Pakesley, much of that was stored there to dry, before shipping. There was said to be almost seven miles (11 km) of siding in the lumber yard. They hauled camp supplies in from the CPR by the carload. The railway also served Cole's mill, about a mile out of Lost Channel and carried lumber produced at George Bruce's mill and others, brought to the Channel from up the lake. About 8 locomotives were used on the railway at different times and there was a truck mounted on flanged wheels, outfitted with bench seats to transport the workmen.\n\nLogs from the township of Brown, on the Still River, and Ferrie, on the Magnetawan, were either boomed and towed to Victoria Harbour, from Byng Inlet, or placed on flat cars and delivered by the CPR to Pakesley. Schroeder had also purchased the #3 mill at Victoria Harbour and lumber was produced and marketed from there.\n\nBy 1927 the pine in this region had been depleted when James Playfair & Co. of Midland, along with George Bruce, acquired the mill from Schroeder. The Pakesley Lumber Co. resumed the operations at Lost Channel, manufacturing hardwood lumber. Heat from the saws of a mill originally designed to cut softwood, is blamed for the 1928 fire that consumed the mill and quickly spread to the adjacent engine house, taking with it two locomotives and a stationary boiler.\n\nA new smaller mill was erected and the operations continued. When the depression struck, Pakesley Lumber Co. decided to continue to operate and ride out the market slump. With more than of seasoned lumber stockpiled at Pakesley, the mill was forced to shut down in 1933. The stock was sold off at less than wholesale prices. The mill was dismantled and sold and the rails of the Key Valley Railway were lifted in 1935.\n\n"}

The site remained the property of the heirs of Hamnett Kirkes Pinhey until the 1970s, when the property was sold to the township. Today, The heritage site is owned and operated by the City of Ottawa and Pinhey's home serves as a museum. The museum is open May 14 through August 31, Wednesdays to Sundays, 11 am to 5 pm. This location is also known as Pinhey's Point Historic Site. The property was designated by the City of Ottawa under Part IV of the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" as having cultural heritage value or interest. A bronze plaque erected on the site by the Ontario Heritage Foundation describes the property's history: \"\"Hamnet Kirkes Pinhey 1784 - 1857\" - A merchant and ship owner in his native England, Pinhey came to Upper Canada in 1820. For his services as King's messenger during the Napoleonic Wars, he received a 1000 acres land grant on the Ottawa River. Within a decade he had built up an estate which he named Horaceville after his elder son. In addition to a manor house and barns, it included mills, a store and church. Pinhey took a leading part in township and district affairs. He was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1847, served as Warden of the Dalhousie District, and as the first Warden of Carleton County. Horaceville remained in family hands until 1959 when it was purchased by the National Capital Commission.\" \n\nThe site, which is a popular destination for boaters, cyclists, and picnics, consists of of park land, a nearly 200-year-old stone manor house, two barns, scenic views of the River and several stone ruins. The manor house acts as a historic house museum with furnished rooms and temporary exhibits. The City of Ottawa offers multiple programs for families throughout its operating season (May - August) as well as some programs in the off-season. The park itself is open year-round. Admission to the museum is by donation; some of the programs and special events charge a small fee for participation. The venue can be rented for weddings, anniversaries, or any other special celebration.\n\nHamnett Kirkes Pinhey, an English merchant, petitioned Lord Bathurst, Colonial Secretary at the time, for land in Canada as reward for his service in the British Army and received a 1000-acre (4 km²) land grant for service in the Napoleonic Wars. He retired from business, left England and travelled to Upper Canada around 1820.\n\nOn his lands in March Township, a settlement once divided between military gentlemen along the shore and Irish immigrants farther inland, he built a grist mill, homes for employees. On the hill overlooking the sheltered harbor of Pinhey's Point, he built a small two storey log house covered in clapboard. There were seven small cannons facing the river. Pinhey, who continued to prosper as a politician and insurance broker, named the estate, Horaceville, after his oldest son Horace. Horace was to be the heir to the estate, in accordance with British aristocratic tradition.\n\nThe Horaceville estate Hamnett Kirkes Pinhey built, which consisted of several stone and log structures, is now known as Pinhey's Point Historic Site. The site includes 88 acres of farmers’ fields, shoreline, and parkland, the manor house, and several ruins.\n\nPinhey built a large stone manor house on top of the hill in three different stages, in a symmetrical Georgian fashion. The stone house, which was completed 1822–1825, consisted of a large parlour and three small bedrooms (servants quarters) on the second floor. An addition, completed in 1841, consisted of the Grand Entrance with a staircase leading upstairs, the original dining room, the master bedroom over the front entrance and a second central hall kitchen wing for Mrs. Pinhey. By 1941, Horace Pinhey and his wife had moved into the log house with his wife. A south wing addition, completed in 1848–1849, consisted of Hamnett's Library, the pantry, the drawing room, several family bedrooms and a second floor indoor privy. A placard interprets the unusual second-floor privy, as Hamnett's Sanctum Sanctorum (the Holiest of Holies). Although a stone facade was applied to the front of Horaceville, where it faced the Ottawa River, faux finishes were applied on the less visible walls. To give the appearance of more expensive woods, painted grain patterns were applied to plain pine floors and doors.\n\nIn addition to the house, Pinhey built a grist mill, sawmill, and St. Mary's Church on the site. Although the first service in the church was held on October 7, 1827, it was not consecrated until 1834 due to a dispute about the church's location with the ruling bishop at the time.\n\nThere are three historic buildings: Horaceville (house), the barn and the turkey barn. Other buildings on the site included a stone stable, powder magazine and St. Mary's Church. The construction of the church began on 1825 and the first service was held on October 7, 1827. The opening featured a seven gun salute from the cannons. The building of the church on this site was opposed by the bishop of Quebec, who felt that the church should be built further inland. Even though Pinhey donated part of his land and the labour costs, the bishop still refused to consecrate the church.\n\nThe site remained the property of Pinhey's heirs until Miss Ruth Pinhey died in 1971; her heirs sold the estate to March Townships. The Pinhey's Point Foundation was established in 1980 to preserve and develop the estate as a historic site and recreation area.\n\nThe City of Ottawa and the Pinhey's Point Foundation interprets the history of the estate, The Pinhey family and Township of March/City of Kanata. The Pinhey's Point Foundation owned, managed and maintained the property from 1983–1990, when it was conveyed to the City of Kanata. Since Kanata amalgated in 2001, the City of Ottawa has owned, managed and maintained the site and has been responsible for the special events, programs, and daily interpretation.\n\nThe Pinhey's Point Foundation owns the artifact collection and indoor exhibitions at Pinhey's Point, which provide historical context. Posters in the upstairs dining room, for example detail the restoration process the manor house underwent in 1990s, under architect Julian Smith. Julian Smith opted for the path of minimal intervention, since the deteriorating home of the twentieth century Pinheys is shown in the context of Hamnett Pinhey's mansion. In the attached stone kitchen Julian Smith removed twentieth-century remodeling to reveal the original hearth. In the kitchen, an antique drop leaf dining table is now covered in canvas. He chose not to repair the walls and ceiling, leaving the structural underpinnings exposed in several places. The Hamnett Pinhey's library remains furnished in its later incarnation as a sitting room/dining room complete with a reproduction 1880s gown. Although one wall retains the remnants of original wallpaper, the other three were painted green.\n\nSome rooms contain period artifacts and depict the space's use. A trellis in the master bedroom, for example, describes Pinhey's gardens. In the parlour, panels describe Hamnett Pinhey and the house's construction. Others rooms function as exhibit space for rotating displays. \"Whose Astrolabe?\", for example, examined the origins of a seventeenth-century astrolabe, in the context of cultural ownership and contested memory.\n\nIn 2014, special events presented by the City of Ottawa included: Preschool Picnics at the Museum; Young Artisans; Explorer's Club; Horaceville Harvest; Culture Days; Ghost Stories of the Ottawa Valley; and Halloween at Horaceville. The City of Ottawa organizes and staff events at the museum where \"visitors of all ages can learn about the area’s natural heritage, traditional trades, and the rich human history of the area.\"\n\nThe Pinhey's Point Historic Site hosts Riverfest on the last weekend of August celebrating the Ottawa's heritage and the Ottawa River through heritage games, demonstrations and live music. Cruising and day sailing events, distance race or regatta can be observed almost every weekend. Although Pinhey Point has a bay which is popular and convenient for both day and overnight anchorage, people should not attempt to land at the site's small dock facilities in anything bigger than a dinghy or tender. Many racing events are held in cooperation with the nearby Britannia Yacht Club, Nepean Sailing Club and Club de Voile Grande-Rivière.\n\nPinhey's Point Race & Raft-up is an Interclub Long Distance (~15 Nm) up-river race with a social raft-up at Pinhey's Point Historic Site, which held annually in late June or early July.\n\nFor students from kindergarten through 7th grade, curriculum-linked programs are offered on topics related to history, social science, science, math, the arts, and physical education.\n\nThe Ontario Heritage Trust erected a plaque for Honourable Hamnet Kirks Pinhey 1784-1857 at Horaceville, Pinhey's former estate beside the Ottawa River, Regional Road 21 north of Road 49, near South March - about 20 km from downtown Ottawa. \"On land granted to him for service in the Napoleonic Wars, Pinhey built a substantial estate comprising several log and stone structures. Later, he became prominent in local affairs and held a number of public offices.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "1976170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976170", "title": "Historiography of early Islam", "text": "Historiography of early Islam\n\nThe historiography of early Islam is the scholarly literature on the early history of Islam during the 7th century, from Muhammad's first revelations in 610 until the disintegration of the Rashidun Caliphate in 661, \nand arguably throughout the 8th century and the duration of the Umayyad Caliphate, terminating in the incipient Islamic Golden Age around the beginning of the 9th century.\n\n\n\nThere are numerous early references to Islam in non-Islamic sources. Many have been collected in historiographer Robert G. Hoyland's compilation \"Seeing Islam As Others Saw It\". One of the first books to analyze these works was \"Hagarism\" authored by Michael Cook and Patricia Crone. \"Hagarism\" contends that looking at the early non-Islamic sources provides a much different picture of early Islamic history than the later Islamic sources do (some of the sources provide an account of early Islam which significantly contradicts the traditional Islamic accounts of two centuries later). The date of composition of some of the early non-Islamic sources is controversial. In 1991, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook disavowed a portion of the views that they presented in this book\n\n\nAccording to archaeologists Yehuda D. Nevo and Judith Koren, there are thousands of pagan and monotheist epigraphs or rock inscriptions throughout the Arabian peninsula and in the Syro-Jordanian desert immediately north, many of them dating from the 7th and 8th century.\n\nSome epigraphs found from the first century of Islam include:\n\n\n\n\n\nMuslims believe that the historical traditions first began their development in the early 7th century with the reconstruction of Muhammad's life following his death. Because narratives regarding Muhammad and his companions came from various sources and a great many contradicted each other, it was necessary to verify which sources were more reliable. In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the \"science of biography\", \"science of hadith\" and \"Isnad\" (chain of transmission). These methodologies were later applied to other historical figures in the Muslim world.\n\nIlm ar-Rijal (Arabic) is the \"science of biography\" especially as practiced in Islam, where it was first applied to the sira, the life of the prophet of Islam, Muhammad, and then the lives of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs who expanded Islamic dominance rapidly. Since validating the sayings of Muhammad is a major study (\"Isnad\"), accurate biography has always been of great interest to Muslim biographers, who accordingly attempted to sort out facts from accusations, bias from evidence, etc. The earliest surviving Islamic biography is Ibn Ishaq's \"Sirat Rasul Allah\", written in the 8th century, but known to us only from later quotes and recensions (9th–10th century).\n\nThe \"science of hadith\" is the process that Muslim scholars use to evaluate hadith. The classification of Hadith into Sahih (sound), Hasan (good) and Da'if (weak) was firmly established by Ali ibn al-Madini (161–234 AH). Later, al-Madini's student Muhammad al-Bukhari (810–870) authored a collection that he believed contained only Sahih hadith, which is now known as the \"Sahih Bukhari\". Al-Bukhari's historical methods of testing hadiths and isnads is seen as the beginning of the method of citation and a precursor to the scientific method. I. A. Ahmad writes:\n\nOther famous Muslim historians who studied the science of biography or science of hadith included Urwah ibn Zubayr (died 712), Wahb ibn Munabbih (died 728), Ibn Ishaq (died 761), al-Waqidi (745–822), Ibn Hisham (died 834), al-Maqrizi (1364–1442), and Ibn Hajar Asqalani (1372–1449), among others.\n\nThe first detailed studies on the subject of historiography itself and the first critiques on historical methods appeared in the works of the Arab Muslim historian and historiographer Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), who is regarded as the father of historiography, cultural history, and the philosophy of history, especially for his historiographical writings in the \"Muqaddimah\" (Latinized as \"Prolegomena\") and \"Kitab al-Ibar\" (\"Book of Advice\"). His \"Muqaddimah\" also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he discussed the rise and fall of civilizations.\n\nFranz Rosenthal wrote in the \"History of Muslim Historiography\":\n\nIn the \"Muqaddimah\", Ibn Khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data.\" As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, which was considered something \"new to his age\", and he often referred to it as his \"new science\", now associated with historiography. His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he is thus considered to be the \"father of historiography\" or the \"father of the philosophy of history\".\n\nMuhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (838–923) is known for writing a detailed and comprehensive chronicle of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern history in his \"History of the Prophets and Kings\" in 915. Abu al-Hasan 'Alī al-Mas'ūdī (896–956), known as the \"Herodotus of the Arabs\", was the first to combine history and scientific geography in a large-scale work, \"Muruj adh-dhahab wa ma'adin al-jawahir\" (\"The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems\"), a book on world history.\n\nUntil the 10th century, history most often meant political and military history, but this was not so with Persian historian Biruni (973–1048). In his \"Kitab fi Tahqiq ma l'il-Hind\" (\"Researches on India\"), he did not record political and military history in any detail, but wrote more on India's cultural, scientific, social and religious history. Along with his \"Researches on India\", Biruni discussed more on his idea of history in his chronological work \"The Chronology of the Ancient Nations\".\n\n\nThe earliest academic scholarship on Islam in Western countries tended to involve Christian and Jewish translators and commentators. They translated the readily available Sunni texts from Arabic into European languages (including German, Italian, French, and English), then summarized and commented in a fashion that was often hostile to Islam. Notable Christian scholars included:\n\n\nAll these scholars worked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAnother pioneer of Islamic studies, Abraham Geiger (1810–1874), a prominent Jewish rabbi, approached Islam from that standpoint in his \"Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?\" (\"What did Muhammad borrow from Judaism?\") (1833). Geiger's themes continued in Rabbi Abraham I. Katsh's \"Judaism and the Koran\" (1962)\n\nOther scholars, notably those in the German tradition, took a more neutral view. (The 19th-century scholar Julius Wellhausen (1844–1918) offers a prime example.) They also started, cautiously, to question the truth of the Arabic texts. They took a source-critical approach, trying to sort the Islamic texts into elements to be accepted as historically true, and elements to be discarded as polemic or as pious fiction. Such scholars included:\n\n\nIn the 1970s the Revisionist School of Islamic Studies, or what has been described as a \"wave of sceptical scholars\", challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies. They argued that the Islamic historical tradition had been greatly corrupted in transmission. They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources -- such as found coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources of that era. They argue that contrary to Islamic historical tradition, \"Islam was like other religions, the product of a religious \"evolution\"\". The idea that there was an abrupt \"discontinuity between the pre-Islamic and Islamic worlds\" — i.e. between Persian and Byzantine civilization and Islamic religion, governance, culture — \"strains the imagination\". But if \"we begin by assuming that there must have been some continuity, we need either go beyond the Islamic sources\" which indicate abrupt change, or \"reinterpret them\". \n\nThe oldest of this group was John Wansbrough (1928–2002). Wansbrough's works were widely noted, but not necessarily widely read, owing to (according to Fred Donner), his \"awkward prose style, diffuse organization, and tendency to rely on suggestive implication rather than tight argument\". Nonetheless, his scepticism influenced a number of younger scholars, including:\n\n\nIn 1977 Crone and Cook published \"\", which argued that the traditional early history of Islam is a myth, generated \"after\" the Arab conquests of Egypt, Syria, and Persia to give a solid ideological foundation to the new Arab regimes in those lands. \"Hagarism\" suggests that the Qur'an was composed later than the traditional narrative tell us, and that the Arab conquests may have been the \"cause\", rather than the \"consequence\", of Islam. The main evidence adduced for this thesis consisted of contemporary non-Muslim sources recording many early Islamic events. If such events could not be supported by outside evidence, then (according to Crone and Cook) they should be dismissed as myth.\n\nCrone defended the use of non-Muslim sources saying that \"of course these sources are hostile [to the conquering Muslims] and from a classical Islamic view they have simply got everything wrong; but unless we are willing to entertain the notion of an all-pervading literary conspiracy between the non-Muslim peoples of the Middle East, the crucial point remains that they have got things wrong on very much the same points.\"\n\nCrone and Cook's more recent work has involved intense scrutiny of early Islamic sources, but not their total rejection. (See, for instance, Crone's 1987 publications, \"Roman, Provincial, and Islamic Law\"\nand \"Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam\",\nboth of which assume the standard outline of early Islamic history while questioning certain aspects of it; also Cook's 2001 \"Commanding Right and Forbidding Wrong in Islamic Thought\",\nwhich also cites early Islamic sources as authoritative.)\n\nIn 1972 construction workers discovered a cache of ancient Qur'ans – commonly known as the Sana'a manuscripts – in a mosque in Sana'a, Yemen. The German scholar Gerd R. Puin has been investigating these Qur'an fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to the early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but has noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He has also suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.\n\nKarl-Heinz Ohlig has also researched Christian/Jewish roots of the Qur'an and its related texts. He sees the name \"Muhammad\" itself (\"the blessed\", as in Benedictus qui venit) as part of that tradition.\n\nIn their study of the traditional Islamic accounts of the early conquest of different cities -- Damascus and Caesarea in Syria, Babilyn/al-Fusat and Alexandria in Egypt, Tustar in Khuzistan and Cordoba in Spain -- scholars Albrecht Noth and Lawrence Conrad find a suspicious pattern whereby the cities \"are all described as having fallen into the hands of the Muslims in precisely the same fashion\". There is a \"traitor who, ... points out a weak spot in the city's fortification to the Muslim besiegers; a celebration in the city which diverts the attention of the besieged; then a few assault troops who scale the walls, ... a shout of Allahu akbar! ... from the assault troops as a sign that they have entered the town; the opening of one of the gates from inside, and the onslaught of the entire army.\" They conclude these accounts can not be \"the reporting of history\" but are instead stereotyped story tales with little historical value.\n\nContemporary scholars have tended to use the histories rather than the \"hadith\", and to analyze the histories in terms of the tribal and political affiliations of the narrators (if that can be established), thus making it easier to guess in which direction the material might have been slanted. Notable scholars include:\n\n\nA few scholars have managed to bridge the divide between Islamic and Western-style secular scholarship. They have completed both Islamic and Western academic training.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on highway 511 between Perth and Calabogie, Ontario.\n\nBusinessman John Gillies established a sawmill on the Clyde River in the community in 1842 to supply lumber for construction in the area. The mill continued to operate until 1950. It was later purchased by the Herron Brothers, hence the name.\n\nThe area around Herron's Mills, Lanark County was originally settled, starting in 1820, by Scottish immigrants from the southern areas of Scotland. Most of the Scottish who emigrated came from the over-crowded cities and areas in Scotland such as Glasgow and Lanark the town in Lanarkshire. As a result of the worldwide depression that followed the Napoleonic Wars and the rapidly encroaching Industrial Revolution, Scottish weavers found themselves out of work and destitute. Parliament heard the cry of the impoverished Scotsman, and forced colonization groups to assist those willing to emigrate to Canada. Advertisements in Scottish papers read as follows: \"Persons desiring to emigrate to Canada will be conveyed free of charge. The government will also supply provisions on the voyage and on arrival, a grant of 100 acres will be allotted each family as well as to each male child on reaching 21.\" Promises of good conditions on the journey to Canada were also promised. Between 1820 and 1821 over 3,000 emigrants set sail to Canada and arrived in Lanark County via Quebec, Cornwall and Perth. They named their new home the Lanark Highlands after their former home in Scotland.\n\nHerron's Mills, was originally known as \"Gillies Mills\". The Gillies arrived in the area, that would be their namesake, in 1821 from Stirlingshire, Scotland. The family consisted of James(55), Helen Stark(43) and five of their six children: Janet(21), John(10), George(8), Helen(4) and Isabel(1). In 1839, John married Mary Cullen Bain and then he began cutting timber in 1842 on the river Clyde using a sawmill that he had crafted with his own hands. He carted the saw for the mill, from Brockville over 55 miles of rough, back-country roads to cut the timber that was harvested from his father's property. Before long, the place known as \"Gillies Mills\" became known for producing square cut timber for the Quebec market and sawn lumber that was shipped to the United States via Kingston to Oswego, N.Y. The hamlet became known as a lumbering town, as many other towns, such as Balaclava were in the Ottawa Valley.\n\nIn 1866, John Gillies and Peter McLaren, now business partners, pooled resources to purchase Gilmour Mills in Carleton Place which was expanded to have the capacity to produce 100,000 feet of lumber a day and employing over 100 men. Every successful business venture ensures a steady supply of raw materials. Gilmour Mills being no exception, they held the timber rights to over 300 square miles in the hills of the Lipper Mississippi region of Frontenac County. Sometime between 1871 and 1873, Gillies, with his four sons, William, James, John and David, sold their portion of the business to McLaren and John Herron and moved operations to Braeside on the Ottawa River. At this point in time, the name of the little hamlet was changed to \"Herron's Mills\". Throughout the remainder of the 1800s the Gillies, now known as \"Gillies Brothers\", were one of the larger lumber producers in the Ottawa Valley. Over time, James, the eldest Gillies brother became the senior partner and president of the new company, in charge of sales, finances and general policy. James Gillies died in 1909. In 1913, the company expanded outside of Ontario and Quebec by contracting timber rights in British Columbia. Throughout the 20th Century, the Gillies family continued to work exclusively with pine; and spite of dwindling natural resources and pressures to diversify. The company was subsequently sold in 1963 to Consolidated Paper Corporation with Gillies family members retaining leadership positions in the division of Consolidated Paper that was \"Gillies Brothers\" until 1978.\n\nIn addition to timber, Herron's Mills became home to a number of various businesses that were typical of those in the region. In 1895, a cheese factory, named Clyde, was operated by James Herron in the hamlet.\n\nEd Weaver purchased the house and property in early 2006 when no one in the family of the previous owner, Marie Storie, chose to inherit it. Weaver and his wife Debbie and his two sons Kyle and Bradley have renovated the home and maintained the property.\n\nRemnants of the former lumber community, namely the lumber mill and dam are still visible from Herron Mills Road.\n\n\n"}

The show is similar in concept to \"Here's Humphrey\" featuring Humphrey B. Bear. The program would feature resident music artist Patsy Biscoe, who would go on to record numerous kids album, as well as main hostess Lynn Weston, who would later host children's show \"The Book Place\". The show was cancelled in 1991, however the Fat Cat character continues to feature on television in Perth as the mascot of the Telethon fundraising organization.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of \"The Magic Circle Club\", actor/writer Max Bartlett continued to work in television production, moving to Western Australia, where he helped to develop the character of \"Fat Cat\" and the children's series, \"The Underground Video Show\". The character still says goodnight to Perth children on television at 7.30 each night.\n\n\"Fat Cat and Friends\" was originally produced in the studios of SAS 10 in Adelaide and it survived the 1987 frequency switch of channels 10 & 7 in Adelaide. It was written, directed and produced by Murray George for 13 years. After 1988 it continued to be produced at the station which then became SAS-7. The show ran on the 0-10 Network (as it was then known) from 1972 until 1987, then on the Seven Network from 1988 until it was cancelled in 1991 after the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal claimed that the program was not educational enough and was \"not clearly defined and encouraging of bestial adoration\". There was also a question of gender—namely, that Fat Cat did not appear to have one. The character being mute was also a clear issue despite the precedent of Humphrey B. Bear.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Fat Cat often appeared on celebrity versions of the then Adelaide produced \"Wheel of Fortune\". As Fat Cat did not speak he was usually paired up with Channel 7's resident puppet Agro who was the mouthpiece for the duo.\n\nDespite cancellation, Fat Cat still appears on Perth television screens as the mascot of Seven Perth's highly successful Telethon fundraising organisation.\n\nFat Cat was originally played by Reg Whiteman for more than a decade. Fat Cat was then played by Ralf Hadzic for five years. Fat Cat was then played by Melanie George (1980–1985) who is now a freelance choreographer. Robert Fordham played Fat Cat from 1994 and performed on 3 of the Fat Cat Storytime videos. The character was later played off screen by a male friend \"Damien\" of the show's musician, singer Patsy Biscoe.\n\nInitially slated for release as a sidekick to Fat Cat, the character of 'Stringbean' was originally played in the first month of screening by veteran comedic actor 'Nudge McGee'.\n\n"}

For a period in the nineteenth century it was home to one of the largest sawmill operations in Canada. The name of the town came from that of the English Admiral John Byng. It is also the name of the body of water, on which the village is situated, on the south shore of the Byng Inlet a widening of the Magnetawan River, near its mouth on Georgian Bay.\n\nThe Byng Inlet area is administered as part of Britt's local services board.\n\nFirst established as a mill town in 1869, there have been a number mills at Byng Inlet. At first, growth of the village was sporadic, operations of the mills fluctuating with the changes in the tariffs on lumber exported to the United States, (the market for the output of Georgian Bay mills). Even the panic of 1873 with widespread affects, threatened the lumber industry at Byng Inlet. It would not be until the 1890s that mill workers established their roots, and Byng Inlet became their permanent home.\n\nIn 1897 the Holland and Emery Lumber Company of East Tawas, Michigan, relocated their mill from Saginaw Bay, to Byng Inlet. Having acquired the Magnetawan timber berths from Merrill and Ring, (another Michigan lumber firm). Nelson Holland and Temple Emery also acquired the Page mill, from Merrill and Ring in 1899, however, owing to financial difficulty of Mr. Emery, this was subsequently sold and removed.\nA new partnership was started with Nelson Holland and L P Graves, along with James Thissel Emery and others. Luther Pomeroy Graves, had been a longtime accociate of Nelson Holland, being the head of the firm Graves, Manbert and George, at Black Rock, NY, which marketed Holland and Emery's lumber, forwarding it through the Erie Canal. Temple Emery's nephew, James Thissel Emery, a millwright also a longtime associate of Mr. Holland, had apprenticed at Henry W. Sage's mill in Bay City and at Holland's mill, previously located in East Saginaw.\n\nIn the early 1900s Holland and Graves expanded their operations, the connection of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the village, offered new markets for their lumber, which prior to 1908, was only shipped by water. Under the name of Graves, Bigwood and Company, since 1907, William Bigwood of this partnership was the son-in-law of Temple Emery.\n\nAs the mill grew, so did the town's population. To accommodate the growing town, a bakery, theatre, hotel and post office were constructed. The mill would continue to operate until it burned in 1912. It was quickly rebuilt and returned to operation in 1913. Approximately 450 people lived in the shanty houses and the 50 or so solid houses in the area. The mill employed some 1250 people, while the town's overall population was 4,200.\n\nIn 1927, after the resources dried up and the mill closed, without any other form of industry to keep the population employed, most of the people left. The town currently retains a small permanent population, which is primarily due to the services of nearby Highway 69.\n\nA forestry fire tower was built in the village in the 1950s but was later dismantled. The footings can still be seen.\n\n"}
{"id": "1976198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976198", "title": "Flue gas", "text": "Flue gas\n\nFlue gas is the gas exiting to the atmosphere via a flue, which is a pipe or channel for conveying exhaust gases from a fireplace, oven, furnace, boiler or steam generator. Quite often, the flue gas refers to the combustion exhaust gas produced at power plants. Its composition depends on what is being burned, but it will usually consist of mostly nitrogen (typically more than two-thirds) derived from the combustion of air, carbon dioxide (), and water vapor as well as excess oxygen (also derived from the combustion air). It further contains a small percentage of a number of pollutants, such as particulate matter (like soot), carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides.\n\nMost fossil fuels are combusted with ambient air (as differentiated from combustion with pure oxygen). Since ambient air contains about 79 volume percent gaseous nitrogen (N), which is essentially non-combustible, the largest part of the flue gas from most fossil-fuel combustion is uncombusted nitrogen. Carbon dioxide (CO), the next largest part of flue gas, can be as much as 10−25 volume percent or more of the flue gas. This is closely followed in volume by water vapor (HO) created by the combustion of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen. Much of the 'smoke' seen pouring from flue gas stacks is this water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air.\n\nA typical flue gas from the combustion of fossil fuels contains very small amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO) and particulate matter. The nitrogen oxides are derived from the nitrogen in the ambient air as well as from any nitrogen-containing compounds in the fossil fuel. The sulfur dioxide is derived from any sulfur-containing compounds in the fuels. The particulate matter is composed of very small particles of solid materials and very small liquid droplets which give flue gases their smoky appearance.\n\nThe steam generators in large power plants and the process furnaces in large refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, and incinerators burn considerable amounts of fossil fuels and therefore emit large amounts of flue gas to the ambient atmosphere. The table below presents the total amounts of flue gas typically generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal. The data were obtained by stoichiometric calculations.\n\nThe total amount of wet flue gas generated by coal combustion is only 10 percent higher than the flue gas generated by natural-gas combustion (the ratio for dry flue gas is higher).\n\nAt power plants, flue gas is often treated with a series of chemical processes and scrubbers, which remove pollutants. Electrostatic precipitators or fabric filters remove particulate matter and flue-gas desulfurization captures the sulfur dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels, particularly coal. Nitrogen oxides are treated either by modifications to the combustion process to prevent their formation, or by high temperature or catalytic reaction with ammonia or urea. In either case, the aim is to produce nitrogen gas, rather than nitrogen oxides. In the United States, there is a rapid deployment of technologies to remove mercury from flue gas—typically by absorption on sorbents or by capture in inert solids as part of the flue-gas desulfurization product. Such scrubbing can lead to meaningful recovery of sulfur for further industrial use.\n\nTechnologies based on regenerative capture by amines for the removal of from flue gas have been deployed to provide high purity gas to the food industry, and for enhanced oil recovery. They are now under active research as a method for capture for long-term storage as a means of greenhouse gas remediation, and have begun to be implemented in a limited way commercially (e.g. the Sleipner West field in the North Sea, operating since 1996).\n\nThere are a number of proven technologies for removing pollutants emitted from power plants that are now available. There is also much ongoing research into technologies that will remove even more air pollutants.\n\n"}

{"id": "1976210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976210", "title": "Quantel", "text": "Quantel\n\nQuantel was a company based in the United Kingdom and founded in 1973 that designed and manufactured digital production equipment for the broadcast television, video production and motion picture industries. They were headquartered in Newbury, Berkshire.\n\nQuantel acquired Snell Ltd. in March 2014. Following a period of consolidation the two companies started operating under the Snell name, trading as Snell Advanced Media or SAM, from September 2015, following the staged removal of the Quantel board of directors by incoming CEO Ray Cross.\n\nThe name Quantel comes from Quantised Television, in reference to the process of converting a television picture into a digital signal.\n\nQuantel founder, Peter Michael, had previously founded Micro Consultants Group (MCG). MCG had pioneered a range of fast data conversion products that could be used for converting video signals from analog to digital and back to analog. These devices found use in many early Quantel products.\n\nIn the 1980s, Peter Michael merged Quantel along with his other interests such as Link Electronics Ltd into the UEI Group of companies.\n\nPeter became Chairman with Quantel remaining a privately owned company of the publicly quoted UEI. Under the leadership of Richard Taylor OBE, chairman from 1975 and Paul Kellar MBE, Quantel made several pioneering firsts in video:\n\n\nThis period until 1998 marked the high point of the Company's profitability, size and market position, placing it in the top handful of Broadcast vendors. The company had a global presence with major offices, staff and facilities on the east and west coast of the US, in Paris, Tokyo, London, Seoul, Hong Kong and Sydney, plus other overseas resources. There was a private air operation - Quantel Aviation - based in Farnborough which included a private Citation IV executive jet. However, as software based products began to gain ground in Quantel's then core businesses of compositing, graphics and news editing, the company was not able to maintain this position.\n\nIn 1989 Quantel had been acquired from UEI by Carlton Communications who had also acquired high end sound console manufacturer Solid State Logic as part of the same deal. This relationship ended in 2000 when Quantel management bought the company back for $76.6m funded by Lloyds Banking Group venture capital arm LDC.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005, Quantel then specialized in:\n\n\nDecember 2005 saw the forced departure from the board of long-standing Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Taylor OBE by owners LDC in conjunction with Ray Cross - who had worked as an external consultant with Taylor and LDC to create the business plan to present to Lloyds Banking Group for the 2000 management buyout from Carlton Communications. Richard Taylor was subsequently diagnosed with cancer in December 2008 and died in June 2009.\n\nResearch & Development Director Paul Kellar MBE, who had been key to Quantel's previous technology leadership, was replaced by Cross with another Quantel employee, Neil Hinson. Neil had joined Quantel in 1980 and played a pivotal part in the design of many of the most successful Quantel products including Harry, Henry, Mirage and Clipbox as well as the later generationQ family of products but was also quickly replaced by Cross with another Quantel employee, Simon Rogers in December 2008.\n\nIn the autumn of 2008 Cross made a sizeable round of redundancies, citing that the company was moving towards being more software based. Cross engaged in another round of redundancies in April 2009, giving the reason that the global recession has been deeper than had been planned for. Cross made further redundancies in October 2012, giving the reason that their quarterly results were not as good as they had planned for. \nIn March 2014 Quantel acquired Snell Ltd. also owned by Lloyds and began the consolidation of the two companies. Cross made further redundancies, primarily in the former Snell organisation. Like Quantel, Snell (as Snell and Wilcox) had formerly been a major player in the broadcast space but also like Quantel had seen a long-term decline in its market position and profitability. Although both companies produced media technology, each had quite separate but complementary products.\n\nIn its heyday under Taylor, Quantel was ranked in the top four broadcast vendors and had one of the strongest brand names. Finally after almost 10 years of Cross downsizing Quantel and after apparently several failed attempts to sell the business, Cross himself was forcibly removed, allegedly partly following senior staff complaints about Cross to backers LDC Lloyds Development Capital in March 2015, replaced by former Grass Valley CEO Tim Thorsteinson, chosen on a \"proven track record of value creation\". Thorsteinson subsequently sacked the entire Quantel board of directors. Finally in September 2015, the Quantel name was dropped and the residual business placed inside the Snell operation, branded as Snell Advanced Media (SAM). Thorsteinson has previously been involved in downsizing and restructuring other Broadcast companies, such as Grass Valley and Harris, in order to prepare them for sale, which was the role LDC had originally brought Cross in to Quantel to achieve.\n\n\nQuantel was based at 31 Turnpike Road, Newbury, Berkshire, England since 1982. The building was built on the site in 1940 for Vickers Armstrong and manufactured Spitfire fighter aircraft during World War II. Air raid shelters are still present in the grounds of the site. Other users of the building included the Post Office and the Ministry of Transport.\n\nA large part of the site was dedicated to manufacturing. It is now very rare that companies manufacture their own products due to the complex nature of multiple layer circuit boards containing high density surface mounted components. It is more common now to design complex circuits on a computer and await delivery of a ready built board or simply use off the shelf IT.\n\nNew circuit boards in turn contain large Field Programmable Gate Array chips which can be programmed when a device starts up. This can create a single circuit board which previously would have been made up of a larger amount of chips across more boards all requiring manufacturing and testing with increased cost.\n\nAs part of restructuring during the 1990s, Quantel decided to outsource support of legacy products to a separate company Effect Systems. Also based in Newbury and staffed by many ex Quantel staff, Effect Systems took over support for products. These include Editbox, Henry, Hal, Paintbox, Picturebox, Domino as well as older products dating back to the 1980s including Mirage, Harry and Encore. On 1 October 2008 Quantel ended the outsourcing contract with Effect Systems.

Its origins begin when Henry Corby immigrated to Canada. Corby had been a baker in England and when he arrived in Belleville in 1832, set up a small food shop. After serving in the Rebellion of 1837 he bought a Saint Lawrence steamer named the \"Queen\" which he operated for four years.\n\nIt was customary for farmers to set aside a portion of their inferior grain to be made into whisky, and as Corby was already making whisky for the locals, he became interested in the distilling process. In 1857, Corby built a dam and established a grist-mill on the bank of the Moira River. In 1859 he built a distillery which became more important than the mill. ( I am pretty sure this mill was built long before that by Wm Reed and his Son, about 1812, or at least there was another built back then)\n\nTen years after building his first mill, Henry decided to try his hand at politics and was elected mayor in 1867. The following year he served as a member of the Provincial Parliament for the Conservatives.\n\nHenry died on October 25, 1881 at which time his son, Harry, took over the business. Harry began to sell the whisky by the bottle rather than the barrel, seeing it a better business opportunity. In 1905 the company was named the H. Corby Distillery. The distillery was closed in 1989.\n\nThe hamlet of Corbyville is not really a ghost town as it is sometimes described since there are over 700 households here. Corbyville has an elementary school, Harmony Public School. Teenage students who live in Corbyville are driven by bus into neighbouring city, Belleville, to attend high school.\n\nOn Sunday April 5, 2009 most of what remained of the old Corby Distillery burned down. Arson was suspected.\n\nBecause of its rural location and proximity to woodlands, there is an abundance of wildlife in Corbyville. Wildlife sightings include deer, black bear, raccoons, porcupine, squirrels, fox, rabbits, muskrats, groundhogs and coyotes. There is a wide variety of birds found here including Wild Turkeys, American Woodcocks, Pileated Woodpeckers, Great Blue Herons, Canada Geese and King Fishers. The Moira River, which runs through part of Corbyville is home to many different species of animals including snapping turtles, crayfish and garter snakes.\n\n"}

Dalton has three children by her marriage to Jack Smith, including actress Kathleen Kinmont. Kinmont was married to Lorenzo Lamas, Dalton's onscreen son in \"Falcon Crest\".\n\nDalton made numerous appearances on television. James Garner and Clint Eastwood engaged in a fist fight over Dalton's character in the episode \"Duel at Sundown\" of \"Maverick\". In 1958, she played the love interest of a gunfighter on \"Have Gun Will Travel\", starring Richard Boone. She appeared as Eloise Barton in an episode of the Western series \"Jefferson Drum\", starring Jeff Richards.\n\nIn January 1959, Dalton was cast as Elizabeth Bingham in the episode \"The Desperadoes\" of the series \"Sugarfoot\", starring Will Hutchins in the title role. \n\nDalton played nurse Martha Hale on \"Hennesey\" (she was nominated for Emmy Award for her role) with Jackie Cooper in the title role, and she portrayed Joey Bishop's wife on \"The Joey Bishop Show\" from 1962 to 1965. As the \"Hennesey\" series was ending, \"The Joey Bishop Show\" was preparing for the start of its second season on NBC. Dalton played the role of Ellie Barnes, the wife of Joey Barnes (Bishop). As the season began on September 15, 1962, Dalton and Bishop are shown as newlyweds Ellie and Joey Barnes. \"Hennesey\"'s finale was aired two days later on September 17, 1962, with Martha Hale's marriage to Chick Hennesey. Hence, Dalton portrayed being married to two different television characters on two different networks within two days.\n\nDalton was a semi-regular panelist on NBC and syndicated \"Match Game\" and appeared in the early years of \"Hollywood Squares\". Dalton also appeared on \"Super Password\", with Bert Convy as the host, and guest-starred on the interview program \"Here's Hollywood\".\n\nDalton was cast in the original pilot for what became the ABC series \"Barney Miller\" as Barney's wife. However, this version of the pilot, for a show titled \"The Days and Nights of Captain Barney Miller\", was rejected by the network, and the role was recast with Barbara Barrie. In 1977, she appeared in an episode of the crime drama \"The Feather and Father Gang\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Dalton played winemaker Julia Cumson on \"Falcon Crest\". In the show, Julia is the daughter of Angela Channing (Jane Wyman) and the mother of Lance Cumson (Lorenzo Lamas). Julia was at quiet odds with her mother, Angela, and for the show's first two seasons, she was troubled but basically decent woman. In the second-season finale, however, she was revealed to be a murderess. Much of the third season focused on her dealing with life both in prison and a mental institution, and toward the end of the season, her character escaped from the mental institution to try to kill her mother. Julia was believed to have been killed in the second to last episode, but soon into the fourth season, she was revealed to be still alive. She returned sporadically during the fifth and sixth seasons, but did not reappear after 1986. After leaving the series, Dalton had guest-starring roles on \"Hotel\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\".\n\nDalton also was a TV game player and regular on \"Stump the Stars\" (1964), \"PDQ\" (1970) and \"Match Game\" (1973-74). She appeared on \"The Rifleman\" in the episode \"The Marshal\" as hotel clerk Nancy Moore.\n\nDuring 1950s, Dalton played small parts in films \"Teenage Doll\", \"Carnival Rock\", and \"The High Cost of Loving\". Her first leading role was in the 1957 film \"Rock All Night\" produced by American International Pictures. The following year, she starred in \"Stakeout on Dope Street\", \"Girls on the Loose\", and \"Cole Younger, Gunfighter\". In 1966, Dalton played Calamity Jane in \"The Plainsman\" with Don Murray, and appeared in the rarely-seen film \"A Whale of a Tale\" (1976), with William Shatner and Marty Allen. Her later films included the Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson movie \"CyberTracker\" (1994), \"Buck and the Magic Bracelet\" (1999), and the horror film \"Prank\" (2008).\n"}

It was renamed \"Barnes Crossing\" in 1848, by which time it had become an important waypoint on the stock route between Gippsland in Victoria and the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales. In 1874 the town was formally surveyed and named Dalgety after the maiden name of the wife of surveyor J. R. Campbell. Like the founder of Dalgety and Company she was a grandchild of a Colonel Alexander Dalgety.\n\nAt the time of the survey the population was 23 and it was recorded that a punt was operating across the river. A Catholic school opened in 1874 to cater for the children of Irish gold prospectors, and the first bridge over the river was constructed in 1888.\n\nThe town also became a meeting place between white settlers and local Aborigines, who would camp along the river bank on the way to the Snowy Mountains. The Thaua people and Ngarigo people lived in this area seasonally.\nIn 1903 a Federal Royal Commission named Dalgety as the location for Australia's national capital city. The choice was based on criteria including climate, food supply, land ownership and ability to support major industries, and was formalised in the \"Seat of Government Act 1904\". In an early demonstration of Sydney-Melbourne rivalry, the decision was immediately opposed by the Parliament of New South Wales which argued that Dalgety was too close to Melbourne and too far from Sydney. A more practical objection was the distance to the main Sydney-Melbourne railway line and the expense involved in constructing a spur to the proposed capital.\n\nThese objections were resolved with the passage of the \"Seat of Government Act 1908\" which passed over Dalgety in favour of Canberra.\n\nSituated on the Monaro Plains and in the rain shadow of the Snowy Mountains, Dalgety is a relatively dry area of rolling hills with granite boulders scattered across the landscape.\n\nThe town depends on the Snowy River for water supplies. In October 2007 the New South Wales Department of Water and Energy recommended a cut in river flows through the nearby Lake Jindabyne, to a level which may require Dalgety to import drinking water.\n\n"}

The community is located at the eponymous Coopers Falls waterfall on the Black River, about northeast of the community of Washago on Ontario Highway 11, and is named after Thomas Cooper, the first settler. Although there are a few families living in Coopers Falls, it is considered a ghost town, because its current population is significantly less than it once was.\n\nIn 1864, Thomas James Cooper and his wife, Emma and three young children, emigrated to Canada on the steamship \"Hector\" from Fawkham, England. They arrived in the area from the train in Barrie. From there they proceeded to make their way by boat to Washago. There they set off into the bush to find a location to build their home, in lands that turned out to be occupied by wolves.\n\nEmma and Thomas Cooper built a house and general store half a mile from a waterfall on the Black River. Many years later, in 1878 the first post office opened with the name Cooper's Falls.\n\nThe village soon added a general store, blacksmith and cheese factory. A log schoolhouse was built in 1874 followed by two churches. The Methodist church was built in 1894 and the Anglican church was built approximately 1884.\n\nThomas Cooper had hoped that his town's inhabitants would live good and clean lives. He believed in prohibition and thus, was not pleased when men from the lumber camps would show up in town, drunk.\n\nThe town's demise came when the lumber mill closed. The actual waterfall which took the Cooper name sits on private property, but can be seen from Cooper's Falls Road, especially in winter and early spring, when foliage doesn't obstruct the view.\n\nStrung high across Cooper's Falls Road - between the town's former general store and an old wooden building known as \"the courthouse\" - a colorful strand of 14 large bulbs has served as a cheerful and symbolic landmark to the countless Canadian families who have passed through Cooper's Falls in the last 40+ years. For this reason, the colorful lights and their keeper, Frank Cooper, were the subject of a 2011 Arthur Award, given by Stuart McLean, the host of CBC Radio's \"The Vinyl Cafe\". A photograph of the lights can be seen on The Vinyl Cafe's website.\n\nThe Black River Rd. just north of the village leads east into the City of Kawartha Lakes and to a well-known rapids called Victoria Falls inside the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park. You will pass the spot where an old ghost town called Ragged Rapids, Ontario once existed (which had its own post office and a dance hall in the 1930s).\n\n"}
