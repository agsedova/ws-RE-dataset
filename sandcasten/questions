1) if diffbot is defined different entities in one sentence with the same words (Zygmunt, Zygmunt_Edward,
        Zygmunt_Edward_"Ziggy" etc), while spacy defines them in the one and only way (e.g. Zygmunt_Edward_"Ziggy" only),
        should we still perserve all variants of entities from diffbot?)
        --> what about reference resolution with DiffBot when we passed the entire abstract as input?
2) [for me] when joining the tokens with underscore: join all entries? only the first?
