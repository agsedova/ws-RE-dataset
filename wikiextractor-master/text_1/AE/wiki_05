She has a twin brother, Joseph. Her debut role was a lead in the romantic tragedy, \"Sparrow\", directed by Franco Zeffirelli, at the age of 18. She later went on to star in a film called \"The Last Best Sunday\", before supporting Winona Ryder in \"Girl, Interrupted\" and Kim Basinger in \"Bless the Child\".\n\nIn 2002, she starred as Abigail Williams in a production of \"The Crucible\" on Broadway alongside Laura Linney and Liam Neeson. Bettis is most famous for her work in independent horror films, and especially her working relationship with writer/director Lucky McKee. Her title role in McKee's 2002 film \"May\" won her something of a cult following. Since then, she has appeared in McKee's \"Masters of Horror\" episode \"Sick Girl\" and provided a voice-over for his film \"The Woods\". In 2006, their \"May\" roles reversed, when McKee acted for Bettis in her directorial debut, \"Roman\", based on a McKee script. In 2011, she played a major role in McKee's adaptation of Jack Ketchum's \"The Woman\". \n\nBettis starred as Carrie White in \"Carrie\", a made-for-TV remake of Brian De Palma's 1976 classic, and headlined Tobe Hooper's \"Toolbox Murders\", an in-name-only remake of an obscure 1970s horror film.

She earned a solid reputation playing leading roles in comedies – a \"reactress\" to comic leads, as she described it.\n\nWalker's film debut came in 1942's \"Lucky Jordan\", a comedy about a gangster (Alan Ladd) who ends up drafted in the Army, where Walker's character reports him AWOL. In the farce \"Brewster's Millions\", her sweetheart inherits $8 million, but can't keep it unless he can spend a million of it within a specified time. Walker also played the romantic interest of Fred MacMurray in the popular comedy \"Murder, He Says\" in 1945.\n\nAfter a promising start in Hollywood, Walker was involved in a 1946 car wreck. A hitchhiker was killed, and Helen and two others were seriously injured. She was charged with drunk and reckless driving. She was subsequently acquitted and made a comeback, but her career never fully recovered. Her final big-screen appearance was in Joseph H. Lewis's film noir \"The Big Combo\" in 1955. She retired from acting at the age of 35 and died in North Hollywood, California from cancer at the age of 47.\n\nShe had just finished making what would become her most well-known film, 1947's \"Nightmare Alley\", and was filming \"Heaven Only Knows\" when an auto accident drastically disrupted Walker's career.\n\nOn December 31, 1946, while driving the car of director Bruce \"Lucky\" Humberstone from Palm Springs to Hollywood, she gave a ride to three hitchhiking soldiers named Robert E. Lee, Philip Mercado, and Joseph Montalvo. Near Redlands, California, the car hit a divider and flipped over, killing Lee and causing serious injuries to Walker and the other two passengers. Mercado brought a civil suit for $150,000 against her. Montalvo suited for $100,000. Walked was also upon manslaughter charges for Lee's death.\n\nThe cases crumbled due to several factors. Walker's attorney was able to block assertions that she was driving drunk. The two plaintiffs were arrested on unrelated charges. Mercado was fingered as a suspect in an armed robbery and arrested. Montalvo admitted to a 1944 narcotics charge and was arrested.\n\nHer criminal trial for manslaughter ended with a dismissal on the motion of San Bernardino County District Attorney Jerome B. Kavanaugh.\n\nAccording to Yvonne de Carlo, Walker, \"the good natured but tough talking starlet\", took Gail Russell \"under her wing and introduced her to the tranquilizing benefits of vodka\" when they were Paramount contractees together. Russell subsequently became an alcoholic.\n\nShe was married to Paramount studio lawyer Robert Blumofe (1942, divorced 1946), and department store executive Edward DuDomaine (1950, divorced 1952). When her house burned in 1960, other actresses held a benefit to assist her.\n\nA Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson's campaign during the 1952 presidential election.\n\n"}

Riverton was seventh of the thirteen communities receiving federal guarantee assistance from HUD as part of their New Communities Program created by the Urban Growth and New Community Development Act of 1970. $12 million was earmarked for the community. Riverton was supposed to encompass a land area bordered on the north by the New York State Thruway, on the west by the Genesee River, on the east by East River Rd., and on the south by the Rush-Henrietta town line, with some development continuing east along Erie Station Rd. Original plans called for construction to occur for a 16-year period and eventually house over 25,000 people, with the community including an 18-hole golf course, 12 swimming pools, 3 artificial lakes, a marina on the Genesee, and commercial and industrial centers. However, only a small portion of this was built along Scottsville-West Henrietta Rd. Created as part of the community were Riverton Knolls, a moderately priced townhouse subdivision, the Riverton Golf Club, a small 9-hole golf course, and the Riverton Park, which included a playground, baseball diamond, river front benches, walking trail, and a volleyball court. Also nestled in a bend in the Genesee was a forested nature park.\n\nRiverton was intended to connect to downtown Rochester via a rapid transit system running on nearby Erie Lackawanna Railroad tracks, which at the time was hosting passenger excursions via the fledgling Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad to Genesee Junction. Language mandating such a rapid transit system was even written into the act creating the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority as a \"Charlotte-Henrietta Corridor.\" However, these plans never materialized. Also, New York State Route 253 was re-routed onto a new extended Erie Station Road from its original Scottsville-West Henrietta Road routing, which bisected the community.\n\nRiverton never got far off the ground, in part because of its relatively remote location in far southern Monroe County. The project nearly went bankrupt in 1974 and had to be bailed out. By 1978, HUD had recommended Riverton to be discontinued from further federal assistance based on market studies that showed that Riverton was unlikely to develop into a successful city.\n\nIn 1979, Joseph C. DeMino, Inc., began leasing the golf course from the town of Henrietta. In 1983, real estate investment trust Home Properties acquired Riverton Knolls. Also, all the Riverton Park improvements were suspiciously destroyed by heavy construction equipment. In 1999, the town of Henrietta agreed to sell Riverton Golf Club and Park to Joseph DeMino for $509,000. This touched off controversy over the future of the nature park, as the DeMinos wanted to expand the golf club to a full 18 holes using the undeveloped land. Nevertheless, in 2002 the sale was finalized by the New York State Legislature. On December 6, 2006, Morgan Management purchased Riverton Knolls from Home Properties. In 2007, the town of Henrietta announced the plan of a new park located south of Scottsville-West Henrietta Rd along the Genesee tentatively named Riverfront Park.\n\nToday, Riverton is all but gone as a separate community; most current residents identify with West Henrietta and share its ZIP code. The Riverton Golf Club continues to operate. Riverton Knolls is now a rental property with many renters tending to be students from the nearby Rochester Institute of Technology. In addition to the rented apartments and townhouses, there are over 500 single family homes and townhouses in the community.\n\n"}

On 23 November 2019, the Sidama Zone became the 10th regional state in Ethiopia after a zone-wide referendum. They speak the Sidamo language, which is a language of the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Despite their large numbers, the Sidama lacked a separate ethnic regional state until continuous protests resulted in the proposal being voted on in a November 2019 referendum.\n\nThe Sidama preserved their cultural heritage, including their traditional religion and language until the late 1880s during the conquest by Emperor Menelik II. Before this, the Sidama had their own well-established administrative systems that dated at least to the 9th century, though it was made up of a loose coalition of Sidama kingdoms. These kingdoms extended into the Gibe region. As a result of marginalization and since the language does not have its own alphabet, very little has been written on Sidama issues. Many were not able to attend school until after the Derg came to power in 1975.\n\nThey number 8.8 million (4.01% of the population) of whom 149,480 are urban inhabitants, the fifth most populous ethnic group in Ethiopia. Their language is called Sidaamu-afoo, which according to the 1994 national census was the mother language of 99.5% of this ethnic group. According to one authority, the majority of the Sidama practice their traditional beliefs, and only in the 1960s that European missionaries came to their region did any leave that faith. However, according to the 1994 national census, only 14.9% practice traditional beliefs while the majority (66.8%) are Protestant, 7.7% Muslim, 4.6% Catholic, and 2.3% practice Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.\n\nOver the course of the 20th century and into the 21st century, there have been increasing moves towards integration among Cushites, including in the amalgamation of language, cultural institutions and geopolitical frameworks, a move which has been dubbed by some analysts as \"pan-Horn\" development or \"pan-Hornism.\n\nToday, the Sidama area has a many number of schools, and adequate health services, though primary, secondary, preparatory and many colleges and university education has increased . There is a Sidama administrative zone within Ethiopia's Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. The Sidama Zone became its own regional state after a November 2019 referendum.\n\nNearly 90% of the Sidama live a life centered on agriculture. An important staple food is the \"wesse\" plant, or false banana. Other crops are also grown and cattle are often raised, with a strong cultural tradition surrounding their ownership. Perhaps the most important source of income is coffee, and \"chat\" or khat trees are also a major source of income. The Sidama area is a major contributor to coffee production, producing a high percentage of export coffee for the central government, second only to the Oromia region. The Sidama farmers have been affected by hunger caused by declining world market prices for coffee, despite supplying the popular coffee chain Starbucks with the majority of their coffee products from the region.\n\nSpirit possession occurs among the Sidama. The anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that spirit possession is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society. The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer (1966) suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.\n\n\n"}

Released on 5 November 1984 by A&M Records, the album was co-produced by Adams and Bob Clearmountain, and it was arguably Adams' most successful solo album. The album has reached 12 million album sales worldwide. It was the first Canadian album to sell more than a million copies within Canada. The album reached number 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and reached high positions on album charts worldwide.\n\nSix singles were released from the album: \"Run to You\", \"Somebody\", \"Heaven\", \"Summer of '69\", \"One Night Love Affair\", and \"It's Only Love\". All six singles made the top 15 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, which until that time had been accomplished previously only by Michael Jackson's \"Thriller \" and Bruce Springsteen's\" Born in the USA. \" The album was ranked No. 49 on \"Kerrang!\"s \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\" in 1989, and 99th Greatest Rock Album of All Time by \"Classic Rock\" and was also named the number 12 Greatest Canadian Album of All Time by Bob Mersereau in his book \"The Top 100 Canadian Albums\". The album was recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios, Vancouver, Canada. On 12 December 2009 the syndicated radio program \"In the Studio\" celebrated the 25th anniversary of the album.\n\nA 30th Anniversary edition of the album, featuring previously unreleased material and a brand new 5.1 surround mix, was released on 10 November 2014 in both four and two-disc editions. The \"Reckless 30th Anniversary Tour\" also took place in November 2014, consisting of eleven exclusive arena shows in the UK.\n\nThe first song recorded was \"Heaven\", which had been co-written by Adams and Jim Vallance for the film \"A Night in Heaven\". The song was recorded at the Power Station in New York on 6-7 June 1983 and was mixed on 16 June 1983, with Bob Clearmountain co-producing and engineering. Despite having been released on the film's soundtrack album, the song was initially not considered suitable for \"Reckless\", only being included at the last minute.\n\nIn March 1984, recording for \"Reckless\" began after extensive touring for the support of \"Cuts Like a Knife\". However, unhappy with the recording process, Adams decided to take a month off. In August, Adams headed back to the studio with Tina Turner for the track \"It's Only Love\"; he also returned with more new songs and started re-recording songs which would lead to the development of such tracks as \"Run to You\", \"Summer of '69\", and \"Heaven\".\n\n\"Run to You\" was recorded after a tour in Asia. The recording for \"Run to You\" started on 27 March 1984 and went through the summer at Little Mountain Sound Studios, Vancouver. It was mixed in New York by Bob Clearmountain, with mixing of the song completed on 21 September. \"Summer of '69\" was written on 25 January 1984 with Jim Vallance. The recording took place at Little Mountain Sound Studios where the song was recorded three times over the winter. It was mixed in New York by Bob Clearmountain on 22 November 1984.\n\n\"Run to You\" was released as the debut single from \"Reckless\" on 18 October 1984 in Canada and the U.S. and became one of the most successful songs from the album on the American pop and rock charts; it would become arguably one of Adams' most recognizable and popular songs. The song was Adams' first number one hit on the \"Billboard\" Top Rock Tracks chart, a position it held for four weeks, and reached number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It reached the top 20 on the Canadian singles chart and remained in the top 20 for seven weeks, peaking at number 4. With \"Run to You\", Adams reached the highest Canadian chart position in his career to that time; it was his third top 20 hit single in Canada. \"Run to You\" was released in November 1984 in Europe where it peaked at the top ten in Ireland at number 8 and reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart; it was his second single to chart in Europe.\n\n\"Somebody\" was released as a single in January 1985 and became one of the most successful songs from \"Reckless\" on the American rock charts. The song was Adams' second number one hit on the \"Billboard\" Top Rock Tracks chart. It reached number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was in the top 20 on the Canadian singles chart for six weeks. \"Somebody\" was Adams' fourth top 20 hit on the Canadian chart. \"Somebody\" was released the following month in Europe and peaked at the top 20 in Ireland at number 20 and reached the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart at 35; it was his third single to chart in Europe.\n\n\"Heaven\" was the third single from \"Reckless\". The single topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks in June 1985. The song previously peaked at number nine on the \"Billboard\" Top Tracks chart from the \"A Night in Heaven\" soundtrack album in February 1984. The song has appeared on all of Adams' compilation albums with the exception of \"The Best of Me\". The single was certified Gold in Canada in 1985.\nUpon the release of the album in November 1984, \"Summer of '69\" received some airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations but was mostly overshadowed by the tracks \"Run to You\" and \"It's Only Love\", only managing to reach number 40 on Billboard's Top Rock Tracks chart. After it was released as a single in June 1985, \"Summer of '69\" reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song was released in Australia, Europe and New Zealand in 1985. \"Heaven\" reached the UK top 40, while \"Summer of '69\" peaked at the top 40. \"Summer of '69\" continued the trend of higher-charting singles when it debuted and peaked at top 20 in most of the European countries it charted. Adams' previous singles had charted much weaker in Europe and \"Summer of '69\" would be Adams' second single to chart in mainland Europe.\n\nAlthough \"Summer of '69\" reached the top ten in Norway and then the top 20 in the Austria, Ireland and Sweden, it was a moderate top 100 success in Germany, where it peaked at 62.\n\nCo-writer Jim Vallance has always gone for the more conventional interpretation of the title being a reference to a year. He notes Jackson Browne's \"Running on Empty\", which contains references to 1965 and 1969, as his own influence, and recalls that Adams cited the film \"Summer of '42\" as his.\n\nReleased as the fifth single from the album in September 1985, \"One Night Love Affair\" peaked on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number 13 and at number 7 on the Top Rock Tracks chart. In Canada, \"One Night Love Affair\" was officially released to radio in February 1985. The song reached the top 20 on the Canadian Singles Chart and remained in the top twenty for another month. \"One Night Love Affair\" was the lowest charting single from Reckless.\n\nWhile never released as a single, \"Kids Wanna Rock\" received airplay on album-oriented rock stations in Canada and the United States enabling it to chart on the \"Billboard\" Top Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at number 42. Due to its popularity in concert, it was included on the greatest hits collection \"So Far So Good\".\n\nSoon after its release, \"Reckless\" peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" 200 in January 1985 before dropping out of the top ten. The success of the singles \"Heaven\" and \"Summer of '69\" renewed interest in the album and it began climbing back up the chart, eventually reaching number one in August 1985. \"Reckless\" also reached number one in Canada and New Zealand, number two in Norway and Australia while reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Sweden. In Canada, Reckless's chart pattern was somewhat similar to its pattern in the US - it entered the top ten shortly after its release peaking at number one in February the dropping out of the top ten for three months between May and July 1985. It re-entered the top ten in August 1985 staying there until February 1986 with the peak of its second top ten run being at number four; it dropped out of the top ten in its 67th week on the Canadian chart|\n\n\"Reckless\" included the hit singles \"Run to You\", \"Somebody\", \"Heaven\", \"Summer of '69\", \"One Night Love Affair\", and \"It's Only Love\". All the singles had accompanying music videos, and each one charted on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Run to You\", \"Summer of '69\", and \"Heaven\" peaking in the top 10. \"Heaven\" would become the most successful single from \"Reckless\" in the United States at the time of its release, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 27 on the album rock chart, although \"Run to You\" was a larger hit at album-oriented rock radio peaking at number 1 on the Top Rock Tracks chart for four weeks, and spending an additional five weeks at number 2, while reaching number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe single \"It's Only Love\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. In 1986, the song won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance.\n\nIn June 2008, the original master tape for \"Reckless\" was destroyed in a backlot fire at Universal Studios. In 2014, Adams planned on remastering the album for a box set. He contacted Universal Music Group, only to find that Universal had lost all the artwork and master tapes. Adams managed to find a backup copy of \"Reckless\" at his home, which he used for the remaster.\n\nIn December 1984, Adams and his touring band which consists of Keith Scott, Dave Taylor, Pat Steward and Johnny Blitz played concerts in Chicago, Detroit, New York City and Philadelphia. In early 1985, Adams' started a tour throughout the United States with opening act and Canadian musician Kim Mitchell and later in Japan, Australia, Europe and finally Canada after winning four Juno Awards. Later he headed south towards the American West Coast, culminating with two dates at the Paladium in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter the tour in the United States Adams traveled to Ethiopia to aid famine relief efforts there. Adams later went to Europe for a fifty-city concert tour with Tina Turner, culminating in April with his return to London to headline three sold-out shows at the Hammersmith Odeon. Adams began the first leg of his tour entitled \"World Wide in 85\" which started in Oklahoma. The tour ended in October. Adams would later visit Vancouver, and afterwards he returned to the American East Coast to play two sold-out concerts in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a conscientious objector during the Second World War, he worked on Quaker land.\n\nArchard's first major television role, reprising the like-titled radio show, was playing Lt Col. Oreste Pinto in the BBC wartime drama series \"Spycatcher\", which ran for four seasons between 1959 and 1961. His TV guest appearances represent some of the most popular shows broadcast in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s: two notable roles in \"Doctor Who\"; as Bragen in \"The Power of the Daleks\" and as Marcus Scarman in \"Pyramids of Mars\", a regular role in \"Emmerdale\"; plus appearances in \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", \"Rumpole of the Bailey\", \"Bergerac\", \"The Avengers\", \"Callan\", \"The Children of the New Forest\" (the 1964 BBC edition), \"Danger Man\", \"Z-Cars\", \"Paul Temple\", \"Dixon of Dock Green, Keeping up Appearances\" and \"The Professionals\".\n\nHe appeared in over fifty films, including \"Village of the Damned\" (1960), \"The List of Adrian Messenger\" (1963), \"Play Dirty\" (1968), \"Run a Crooked Mile\" (1969), \"The Horror of Frankenstein\" (1970), Roman Polanski's \"Macbeth\" (1971), \"Dad's Army\" (1971), \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1973), \"The Sea Wolves\" (1980), \"Krull\" (1983) and \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1985).\n\nArchard and his long term partner, James Belchamber, ran a touring repertory company, based in Torquay, which included Hilda Braid among its players. On the West End stage he appeared at Her Majesty's Theatre as a magistrate in the Terence Rattigan play \"Cause Célèbre\" and in \"The Case of the Oily Levantine\" by Anthony Shaffer.\n\n"}

It was broadcast by the BBC in four series (seven episodes each in series 1, 3 and 4 and six in series 2) from 1975 to 1979.\n\nThe main characters are: Carter Brandon (played by Stephen Rea and, in series 3 and 4, Keith Drinkel); his uncle, Uncle Mort (Robin Bailey); his mother, Annie (Liz Smith); his father, Les (John Comer); his girlfriend (later wife), Pat Partington (Anita Carey and, in series 3 and 4, Liz Goulding); and his other uncle, Uncle Staveley (Bert Palmer and, in series 4, Leslie Sarony). Auntie Lil (Gretchen Franklin), appears in the first two series. Other recurring characters, mostly from Carter's workplace, are: Linda Preston (Deirdre Costello); Mrs Partington, Pat's mother (Vanda Godsell); Sid Skelhorn (Ray Dunbobbin and, in series 3 and 4, Bobby Pattinson); and Louis St. John (Paul Barber).\n\nThe novels narrate the story of which Carter's thoughts are an integral part. A recurring theme in the books is conversation between Carter and baby Daniel (Uncle Mort's son). One feature of the books is a line at the top of each page which summarizes the developments on that page. The TV series adhere more closely to the conventions of situation comedy, and present generally light-hearted versions of the stories from the books.\n\nIn the TV series, Uncle Staveley (remembered for his catchphrase, \"I heard that! Pardon?\") always appears with the ashes of Corporal Parkinson—one of his comrades from World War I—in a box around his neck.\n\nPeter Tinniswood wrote six further series for BBC Radio 4 featuring members of the Brandon family between 1987 and 1996; two six-episode series each of \"Uncle Mort's North Country\", \"Uncle Mort's South Country\", and \"Uncle Mort's Celtic Fringe\". In these series, Stephen Thorne played Uncle Mort, with Peter Skellern as Carter Brandon (Sam Kelly replaced Skellern in \"South Country\").\n\n"}

Though the \"Symphonic Picture\" is sometimes dismissed as a sequence of the opera's \"greatest hits,\" the first well-known melody, \"Summertime,\" is not heard until nearly seven minutes into the work. While some of the more esoteric parts of the opera are absent, many of the catchier tunes that can be heard in this suite are absent in others, including Gershwin's own \"Catfish Row Suite\", which tended to highlight the more cerebral elements of the work.\n\nThe score was prepared at the behest of Fritz Reiner, then conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and one of Gershwin's most favored conductors (Reiner had hosted Gershwin while leading the Cincinnati Symphony in the 1920s, and gave the second-ever performance of \"An American in Paris\".) Reiner's surviving outline for the work shows that he laid out the order of the excerpts and even keys—a few short sections were transposed, with overall key sequence in mind—almost down to the measure. Reiner aimed for a precisely-24-minute length; it was designed to fit three 78-rpm records (4 minutes per side). Reiner at first considered retaining the solo piano \"Jazzbo Brown\" sequence. Once he had changed his mind, he did not include Gershwin's piano in his specified instrumentation (in Gershwin's opera, the piano is used primarily to double and reinforce the orchestral texture, rather than in an obbligato role). The actual orchestration in most passages is very closely based on Gershwin's original scoring.\n\nFor the 1943 Pittsburgh premiere, Bennett provided this synopsis: \n\n\"*italicized words are the titles in Gershwin's original score\"\n\nBennett arranged \"Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture\" for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B-Flat, bass clarinet in B-Flat, 2 alto saxophones in E-Flat, tenor saxophone in B-Flat, 2 bassoons; 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B-Flat, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass), tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, xylophone, triangle, steel bells, cymbals, tubular bells, glockenspiel, snare drum, bass drum and wood block; banjo, 2 harps and strings.\n\n"}

It was owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment. The casino offered a casino and three hotels with a total of 1,356 rooms. There was also an RV park, the Bellissimo Spa & Salon, a convention center, and a 2,500 seat entertainment venue called the Harrah's Event Center.\n\nCiting steadily declining business rates in its last few years, Caesars announced the closure of Harrah's Casino Tunica, along with its hotels, golf course, and events center in March 2014. The casino permanently closed on June 2, 2014 and was demolished in August 2015. , the three hotel buildings remain standing, but have not operated since the resort's closure in 2014. The golf course and events center have also been abandoned.\n\nThe casino itself was built in 1996. It was the largest casino between Las Vegas and Atlantic City, featuring a large poker room. The Harrah's Casino Hotel was directly connected to the casino and contained 148 rooms and 40 suites. Two additional hotels were situated along a lake approximately ½ mile away. Complimentary shuttle service ran 24 hours a day to take guests to and from the casino. The Veranda Resort Hotel, which opened in 1996 along with the casino, contained 532 rooms and 36 suites. The largest hotel was the Terrace Hotel & Spa, which opened in 1999 and contained 563 rooms and 37 suites.\n\nGrand Casino Tunica's original owner was Grand Casinos, Inc., headed by Lyle Berman, a pioneer in developing resort-style casinos on Native American reservations and in Mississippi.\n\nIn 1998, Berman and Grand Casinos, Inc., sold their Tunica, and Biloxi, Mississippi resorts to the gaming division of Hilton Hotels, with the combined assets being spun off to create a new corporation called Park Place Entertainment (later renamed Caesars Entertainment).\n\nIn 2005, Caesars Entertainment was acquired by Harrah's Entertainment, which converted back to the Caesars Entertainment name in 2010.

{"id": "2325319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325319", "title": "David W. Taylor", "text": "David W. Taylor\n\nDavid Watson Taylor (March 4, 1864 – July 28, 1940) was a U.S. naval architect and an engineer of the United States Navy. He served during World War I as Chief Constructor of the Navy, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair. Taylor is best known as the man who constructed the first experimental towing tank ever built in the United States.\n\nTaylor was born in Louisa County, Virginia. He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1881, after graduating from Randolph-Macon College where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. He graduated from the Academy in 1885 at the head of his class, setting a scholarship record, which still stands today. He was then sent to Greenwich, England in 1885 and received the highest honors of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1888, again setting a record.\n\nIn August 1886, Taylor was appointed an assistant naval constructor. Early in his naval career he served on various stations and in 1909 acted as chief of the navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair. In 1895 he was the first American honored by award of a gold medal of the British Institute of Naval Architects. \n\nIn 1898 he constructed and had charge of the first experimental tank for models of war vessels built in the United States. He was connected with boards dealing with hull changes of naval vessels. In probably the greatest achievement of his career he created the \"Taylor Standard Series\" of 80 models with systematically varying proportions and prismatic coefficient. This series is still used for preliminary estimates of ship resistance for twin screw, moderate to high speed naval ships. The book was revised in 1933 with the addition of data on 40 new models. The series data was re-analyzed using more recent methods of evaluating friction resistance, and the results were published in 1954. Both \"Speed and Power\" and the Reanalysis were republished by the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers in 1998, the centennial of the EMB.\n\nThe Taylor Series allows variation of the slenderness ratio, beam to draft ratio, and prismatic coefficient. While these are far from the only parameters that can be varied in a warship's hull design, it is possible to get a preliminary estimate of ship resistance from the series for essentially all warships, and many merchant ships, built since Taylor's time. Taylor's main contribution was to recognize that these three simple parameters were the critical ones for ship performance. A Taylor series estimate is accurate enough to plan the model test and to develop an idea of how much power will be required to achieve design speed, prior to model testing the actual hull form. Today the Taylor Series has been programmed in electronic form and is used in several ship \"synthesis models\" to do feasibility studies for new ships.\n\nAfter the \"RMS Titanic\" disaster of 1912, he was assigned to investigate the problem of making ships more seaworthy through better hull construction. On this duty, he served under the Secretary of Commerce and took a leading part in the International Conference on Safety at Sea, which grew out of the \"Titanic\" sinking.\nOn December 14, 1914, a few months after the outbreak of war in Europe, Taylor became chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, with the rank of rear admiral on December 14, 1914. He held that post throughout the war, along with the title of Chief Constructor of the Navy. \n\nTaylor's active interest in aviation was stimulated by his appointment as a representative of the government on the National Research Council in 1916. In January, 1917, he was senior member of the Joint Army and Navy Technical Board for Design and Construction of a Zeppelin-type airship. \n\nThrough the World War, Taylor supervised the creation of numbers of new ships for naval service. For this work the navy bestowed upon him the Distinguished Service Medal, with the citation: \"For exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility as Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair.\" The French government made him a Commander of the Legion of Honor.\n\nTaylor also aided in the development of the NC-type flying boat, the first aircraft to make a transatlantic flight.\n\nTaylor remained the head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair until 1922.\n\nAfter his retirement from Naval service, Taylor focused his attention on aeronautics. He played a major role in promoting aviation's technical development, serving on several committees of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the precursor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Taylor served as chairman of NACA's Subcommittee on Aeronautical Inventions and Designs after the subcommittee was organized in March 1927. Later that year, he was made chairman of the Subcommittee on Aerodynamics. \n\nLong recognized as an international authority on naval architecture and marine engineering. Taylor applied the principles of hydrodynamics to the problem of aerodynamics. Following this new field of aviation, Taylor became one of the foremost authorities in the world in aerodynamics. He specialized on problems connected with the design of aircraft propellers and of seaplane floats and flying-boat hulls.\n\nIn 1931, Taylor was awarded the John Fritz Medal, the highest honor of the American engineering profession, \"for outstanding achievement in marine architecture, for revolutionary results of persistent research in hull design, for improvements in many types of warships and for distinguished service as chief constructor for the United States Navy during the World War.\"\nShortly before his death, the navy's Research and Development community honored Taylor by naming its new model basin after him. The new model basin constructed at Carderock, Maryland, the finest facility of its kind in the world, was dedicated as the David Taylor Model Basin in his presence in 1939. The Model Basin retains his name as a living memorial to this distinguished naval architect and marine engineer. \n\nTaylor died in Washington, D.C. on July 28, 1940.\n\nTaylor was influential in the development of the United States Navy's superiority. His legacy, and genius, live on in his descendants, awards (below), and the water basin which still retains his name (Above). \n\nIn addition to the Model Basin, the navy has honored Taylor's legacy in several ways. In 1942 the destroyer \"David W. Taylor\" (DD-551) was named in his honor. The Navy's David W. Taylor Award recognizes outstanding scientific achievement, awarded for a contribution to the development of future maritime systems through the creation of technology based upon research. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland.\n\nThe Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers awards the David W. Taylor Medal for \"notable achievement in naval architecture and/or marine engineering.\"\n\nThe SS \"President Cleveland\" was intended to be named USS \"Admiral D. W. Taylor\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2325332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325332", "title": "Constitution of California", "text": "Constitution of California\n\nThe Constitution of California () is the primary organizing law for the U.S. state of California, describing the duties, powers, structures and functions of the government of California. California's original constitution was drafted in both English and Spanish by American pioneers, European settlers, and Californios (Hispanics of California) and adopted at the 1849 Constitutional Convention of Monterey, following the American Conquest of California and the Mexican-American War and in advance of California's Admission to the Union in 1850. The constitution was amended and ratified on 7 May 1879, following the Sacramento Convention of 1878-79.\n\nThe Constitution of California is one of the longest collections of laws in the world, partially due to provisions enacted during the Progressive Era limiting powers of elected officials, but largely due to additions by California ballot proposition and voter initiatives, which take form as constitutional amendments. Initiatives can be proposed by the governor, legislature, or by popular petition, giving California one of the most flexible legal systems in the world. It is currently the eighth longest constitution in the world. \n\nMany of the individual rights clauses in the state constitution have been construed as protecting rights even broader than the United States Bill of Rights in the Federal Constitution. An example is the case of \"Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins\", in which \"free speech\" rights beyond those addressed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution were found in the California Constitution by the California courts. One of California's most significant prohibitions is against \"cruel \"or\" unusual punishment,\" a stronger prohibition than the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against \"cruel \"and\" unusual punishment.\" This caused the California Supreme Court to find capital punishment unconstitutional on state constitutional grounds in the 1972 case of \"People v. Anderson\".\n\nThe constitution has undergone numerous changes since its original drafting. It was rewritten from scratch several times before the drafting of the current 1879 constitution, which has itself been amended or revised (see below).\n\nIn response to widespread public disgust with the powerful railroads that controlled California's politics and economy at the start of the 20th century, Progressive Era politicians pioneered the concept of aggressively amending the state constitution by initiative in order to remedy perceived evils. From 1911, the height of the U.S. Progressive Era, to 1986, the California Constitution was amended or revised over 500 times.\n\nThe constitution gradually became increasingly bloated, leading to abortive efforts towards a third constitutional convention in 1897, 1914, 1919, 1930, 1934 and 1947. By 1962, the constitution had grown to 75,000 words, which at that time was longer than any other state constitution but Louisiana's.\n\nThat year, the electorate approved the creation of a California Constitution Revision Commission, which worked on a comprehensive revision of the constitution from 1964 to 1976. The electorate ratified the Commission's revisions in 1966, 1970, 1972, and 1974, but rejected the 1968 revision, whose primary substantive effect would have been to make the state's superintendent of schools into an appointed rather than an elected official. The Commission ultimately removed about 40,000 words from the constitution.\n\nThe California Constitution is one of the longest in the world. The length has been attributed to a variety of factors, such as influence of previous Mexican civil law, lack of faith in elected officials and the fact that many initiatives take the form of a constitutional amendment. Several amendments involved the authorization of the creation of state government agencies, including the State Compensation Insurance Fund and the State Bar of California; the purpose of such amendments was to insulate the agencies from being attacked as an unconstitutionally broad exercise of police power or inherent judicial power.\n\nUnlike other state constitutions, the California Constitution strongly protects the corporate existence of cities and counties and grants them broad plenary home rule powers. The constitution gives charter cities, in particular, supreme authority over municipal affairs, even allowing such cities' local laws to trump state law. By specifically enabling cities to pay counties to perform governmental functions for them, Section 8 of Article XI resulted in the rise of the contract city.\n\nArticle 4, section 8(d) defines an \"urgency statute\" as one \"necessary for immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety\"; any proposed bill including such a provision includes a \"statement of facts constituting the necessity\" and a two-thirds majority of each house is required to also separately pass the bill's urgency section.\n\nMany of the individual rights clauses in the state constitution have been construed as protecting rights broader than the Bill of Rights in the federal constitution. Two examples include (1) the \"Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins\" case involving an implied right to free speech in private shopping centers, and (2) the first decision in America in 1972 which found the death penalty unconstitutional, \"California v. Anderson\", 6 Cal. 3d 628. This noted that under California's state constitution a stronger protection applies than under the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment; the former prohibits punishments that are \"cruel or unusual\", while the latter only prohibits punishments that are \"cruel and unusual\". The constitution also confers upon women equality of rights in \"entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment.\" This is the earliest state constitutional equal rights provision on record.\n\nTwo universities are expressly mentioned in the constitution: the University of California and Stanford University. UC is one of only nine state-run public universities in the United States whose independence from political interference is expressly guaranteed by the state constitution. Since 1900, Stanford has enjoyed the benefit of a constitutional clause shielding Stanford-owned property from taxes as long as it is used for educational purposes.\n\nThe constitution of California distinguishes between constitutional amendments and revisions, the latter of which is considered to be a \"substantial change to the entire constitution, rather than ... a less extensive change in one or more of its provisions\". Both require passage of a California ballot proposition by voters, but they differ in how they may be proposed. An amendment may be placed on the ballot by either a two-thirds vote in the California State Legislature or signatures equal to 8% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, among the lowest thresholds for similar measures of any U.S. state.\n\n, this was 997,139 signatures compared to an estimated 2018 population of 39,557,045. Revisions originally required a constitutional convention but today may be passed with the approval of both two-thirds of the legislature and a majority of voters; while simplified since its beginnings, the revision process is considered more politically charged and difficult to successfully pass than an amendment.\n\nMany of the signatories to the state's original 1849 constitution were themselves prominent in their own right, and are listed below. The list notably includes several Californios (California-born, Spanish-speaking residents). \n\n\n\n"}

He first appeared in \"The Heckler\" #1 (cover-dated September 1992), the first of an ongoing series that ended with \"The Heckler\" #6 (cover-dated February 1993).\n\nKeith Giffen created the Heckler as \"a superhero Bugs Bunny\" because he wanted to work with Bugs Bunny but felt that DC Comics (who were publishing Bugs Bunny's comics at the time) would not have approved of his handling of the character. Tom and Mary Bierbaum, who had previously worked with Giffen on \"Legion of Super-Heroes\", scripted the series over his plots and pencils for its entire run.\n\nThough the Heckler's costume is covered with \"Ha ha\"s, Giffen told the Bierbaums that the Heckler must never laugh in this manner, since the \"Ha ha\" laugh was a signature aspect of the Creeper.\n\nThough \"The Heckler\" #7 appeared in solicitations, no work was ever done on it beyond the plot and cover art. Humor comics were at the low point of their popularity, and after learning that sales on the series were \"plummeting\", Giffen approached DC and asked them to cancel \"The Heckler\" and leave #6 as the final issue.\n\nStuart \"Stu\" Moseley, co-owner of \"EATS\", a skid row diner in the ghetto section of Delta City, fights the injustices and slightly goofy criminal element as The Heckler, armed only with his sarcastic wit and a brightly colored costume.

Possibly he's just a glutton for punishment, for it seems that he receives no respect from his contemporaries in either his civilian or costumed alter ego's existence. \n\nWhile walking around as Stu, he comes across as slightly anal, frustrated and awkward. When wearing his costume, however, he seems to become a completely different person, endlessly confident and insanely daring with a talent for trickery and a smart-mouthed sense of humor that he uses to irritate, annoy and insult his foes until they usually pretty much defeat themselves in a style highly reminiscent of cartoon character Bugs Bunny (who artist/creator Keith Giffen admits was a major influence on the creation of the Heckler). He lacks any actual superpowers, yet has had a lengthy rap career as \"piss trigger\".\n\nLedge - Stu's buddy and one of the very few people that's in on his Heckler alter-ego. Notable for his bad spelling, Ledge provides most of Stu's information regarding his opponents, keeping extensive dossiers on all major crime figures in Delta City.\n\nFrançois - Stu's slightly anal-retentive and obsessive but highly creative French cook at \"Eats.\"\n\nMr. Dude - One of the patrons of \"EATS\". A leather jacket-clad overweight and middle-aged greaser who provides Stu with information on underworld activities and is regularly visited by the denizens of Delta City, including generals and monsignors, for advice on a vast variety of subjects.\n\nGus McDougal - Officer of the Delta City Police Department and ex-husband of the Minx. McDougal bemoans the changing face of Delta City's downtown core, and when we first see him he is weeping for the loss of \"42 Varieties\", a donut shop which has been bulldozed to make room for a McDonald's.\n\nMayor Clump - Delta City's mayor has a grey, undefined face. He wears either a \"liberal\" or \"conservative\" human face mask, depending on his audience.\n\nThe Minx - A beautiful gun-toting loner in dark glasses and a mohawk who has a teenage daughter named Axi. She hunts down criminals in Delta City for the reward money, but there is a distinct personal motivation involved as they all tend to be men she's previously gone on bad dates with. Much like Ledge, keeps copious computer files on the subject. Very much a parody of characters like The Punisher, Minx guns down criminals without consideration for due process and typically leaves no survivors.\n\nX-Ms. - One of the Heckler's superheroic peers in Delta City. She defends the Christmas-themed section of Delta City called \"Tinseltown\".\n\nRabbi Zone and Dreidel - The Rabbi is part of the Brotherhood of the Zone Magi, an ancient order that \"in eons past...enforced order in the cosmos\". His undefined powers come from the Zone Patch, a purple circle in the palm of his right hand. Dreidel is Zone's adolescent sidekick, with the power to spin and travel at top speeds. Though they are meant to be a Jewish parody of Batman and Robin, they do not wear costumes.\n\nLex Concord - The Heckler never meets Concord, who was apparently the sole superhero for Colonial Delta City during the 1800s. Concord was lost, along with the entire settlement, during a previous invasion by the giant naked and inhumanly obese, curler-headed demonic entity called the Flying Buttress who simply licked up and devoured the entire town, buildings and all. By the time the Heckler comes across Colonial Delta's remains, the purple and green-clad Lex Concord (who has \"Don't Tread On Me!\" written on the forehead of his mask) has disappeared via time travel into a Jack Kirby-esque future.\n\nBoss Glitter - Incredibly dainty and theatrical mob boss of Delta City. Has a penchant for elaborate masks, frilly clothes and the ruthless removal of all those who fail him.\n\nP.C. Rabid - Ultra-conservative media celebrity. Constantly instigating plans that present imagery used as an attempt to demonize the Heckler. Wears a human face mask; his real face is never revealed.\n\nBushwack'r - Bounty hunter who attempts to collect a price placed on the Heckler's head. A victim of his own constant bad luck, as his weapons and actions keep misfiring and injuring only himself. The character is clearly a parody of Wile E. Coyote, forming elaborate traps that backfire. In one panel of the issue, the biography of Chuck Jones is prominent.\n\nEl Gusano - Assassin hired by Boss Glitter that resembles a large faceless brown humanoid earthworm dressed in a snappy dress suit. Seems to be Latin in origin.\n\nJohn Doe, The Generic Man - A complete blank slate. Attempted to take over Delta City by using his ability to rob his environment (including all inanimate objects and persons in the surrounding vicinity) of any of its individual characteristics. Often accompanied by his girlfriend or sidekick (depending), a young woman named Buckshot with exploding freckles.\n\nRachet Jaw and Kriegler - Trigger men for Boss Glitter. Rachet Jaw is a common-looking mobster with a mechanical lower jaw that unhinges to reveal a gun barrel. The gun can be fed through an ammo belt attached to his chin. Kriegler is Rachet Jaw's verbose, diminutive sidekick.\n\nThe Cosmic Clown - An android assassin from the stars. Humanoid, dresses like a clown. He is apparently one of a whole host of clown-shaped killer robots, who is at odds with his own clan and assumes that circuses and clowns on Earth are bent on murder.\n\nC'est Hay - Psychopathic killer who resembles a scarecrow and is composed completely of hay and/or straw. Has delusions of being an actor, speaks in stilted tongue, as if emoting dialogue… that is when he's not singing and dancing.\n\nThe Four Mopeds of the Apocalypse - The erstwhile sidekicks of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the Mopeds are hanging out in various sections of Delta City, watching for signs of the end times. They include Skippy, Famine Lass, Plague Boy and Kid Pestilence and are charged with summoning the dread Flying Buttress, a gigantic and grotesquely fleshy floating female Elder God who is all digestive system and who had been exiled to another dimension by the Zone Magi.\n\nCuttin' Edge - This character never actually appeared in any comic. A crusader for edgy and cynical art who despises mass-appeal media, he was to be the villain of the intended seventh issue that was never completed.\n\nThe Keith Giffen-created DC Comics character Vext (who starred in the short-lived series of that name in 1998) was also a resident of the fictional Delta City. Delta City more recently appeared in an issue of Giffen's Doom Patrol series, undergoing considerable damage because of alternate reality versions of the team appearing and causing melee.\n\nThe Heckler appears on two panels on page 31 of \"JLA: Welcome to the Working Week\" alongside Plastic Man and Ambush Bug.\nThey seem to be leaving to get ready for a keg party.\n\nIn issue 12 of \"Book of Fate\", Heckler makes a cameo in a bar called Warriors where he and some other lesser known heroes are talking about their crime fighting memories. The Heckler also is singing \"Memories are Made of These\" by Dean Martin.\n\nThe Heckler is in the Scribblenauts video game \"\".\n\n(n.d.).

In 1963 he took up a Beit scholarship to read Natural Sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1966 he was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship to study for a doctorate in mathematical physics at Imperial College London where he was subsequently appointed to the staff. As an academic during the 1970s he taught at the University of London and at the University of California, consulted and wrote a number of academic papers and a book on the use of computers in physics.\n\nPotter founded Psion in 1980. In its early years, Psion became a leader in software for home microcomputers. In 1984, Psion invented 'The Organizer', the world's first volume hand-held computers for personal use and information.\n\nIn 1988, Potter led Psion's flotation on the London Stock Exchange and saw Psion's scale and value multiply many times. The company expanded further into data-communications and mobile corporate solutions. In 1998, using Psion's experience in small mobile operating systems, Potter led the creation of Symbian Limited in partnership with Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola and Matsushita to create the operating system standard for mobile wireless devices – now known as Symbian.\n\nIn 1999, Potter stood down as chief executive of the company and assumed the role of chairman, and retired as chairman in September 2009.\n\nPotter has been a member of the London Regional Council of the CBI, a Board member of the London First Centre and co-Chairman of the London Manufacturing Group.

{"id": "2325367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325367", "title": "Society (film)", "text": "Society (film)\n\nSociety is a 1989 American body horror film directed by Brian Yuzna, and starring Billy Warlock, Devin DeVasquez, Evan Richards, and Ben Meyerson. Its plot follows a Beverly Hills teenager who finds his wealthy parents are part of a gruesome cult for the social elite.\n\nThough the film was completed in 1989, it was not released until 1992. It was Yuzna's directorial debut and was written by Rick Fry and Woody Keith. Screaming Mad George was responsible for the special effects. A sequel, \"Society 2: Body Modification\", was in development, with a script written by Stephan Biro.\n\nBill Whitney lives with his parents and sister in a mansion in Beverly Hills, California. Despite their wealth, Bill tells his therapist Dr. Cleveland that he does not trust his high-society family. When his sister's ex-boyfriend Blanchard gives him a surreptitiously recorded tape of what sounds like his family engaged in a murderous orgy, Bill begins to suspect that his feelings are justified. Bill gives the tape to Dr. Cleveland, but when he later plays it back, the audio has changed to his sister's coming out party. When Bill attempts to meet Blanchard to obtain another copy, he finds an ambulance and police officers gathered around Blanchard's crashed van. A body is placed into the back of the ambulance, but Bill is prevented from seeing its face.\n\nBill attends a party hosted by his upper-class classmate Ferguson, who confirms that the first tape was real. Angry and confused, Bill leaves the party with Clarissa, a beautiful girl he had been admiring. The next day, Bill confronts his parents and sister. At Blanchard's funeral, Bill and his friend Milo discover that Blanchard's corpse may be fake. Bill is contacted by Martin Petrie, his rival for the high school presidency. At their arranged meeting, Bill discovers Petrie with his throat cut. When he returns with the police, the body is gone. The next day at school, Petrie shows up, alive and well. When Bill arrives at home, he confronts his family again, but with Dr. Cleveland's help, they drug Bill. As Milo trails him, Bill is taken to a hospital. Bill awakens in a hospital bed and thinks he hears Blanchard crying out, but discovers that nothing is there. Milo tries to warn him, but he drives back to his house.\n\nAt home, Bill finds a large, formal party. Dr. Cleveland reveals that Bill's family and their high-society friends are actually a different species from Bill. To demonstrate, they bring in a still-living Blanchard. The wealthy party guests strip to their underwear and begin \"shunting\" - physically deforming and melding with each other - as they suck the nutrients out of Blanchard's body. Their intention is to do the same to Bill, but he escapes and runs around the house, finding his family engaged in similarly disgusting activities as he does. He confronts Ferguson, killing him by reaching inside him mid-shunt and pulling him inside-out. Bill escapes with the help of Milo and Clarissa, who is also of the alternate species but has fallen in love with Bill.\n\nAfter having several of his productions fail for lack of finding a director, Yuzna decided to move into directing. As producer of \"Re-Animator\", he held the rights to a sequel and knew he could find financing. He used this as leverage for a two-picture deal, the first of which turned into \"Society\". Yuzna said that he wanted the safety of having two pictures to establish himself as a successful director. \"Society\"s script appealed to Yuzna partly because it was thematically similar to a failed project he had begun with Dan O'Bannon. Yuzna altered the script from a traditional slasher film climax about a religious cult to the surrealistic aliens. The production company introduced him to Screaming Mad George, who they knew to also be interested in surreal gore. For the film's most surreal and gory sequence, the \"shunting,\" Yuzna based it on his nightmares. The sequence was further inspired by The Great Masturbator, a Dali painting. Author Jon Towlson identifies political themes imported from paranoid science fiction thrillers, such as \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and \"Invaders from Mars\". Yuzna later cited the film's mix of paranoia, black humor, satire, and gore as alienating mainstream audiences.\n\n\"Society\" premiered at the Shock Around the Clock Film Festival in London in 1989. For its British release, \"Society\" was marketed in \"Video Trade Weekly\" with a picture of the film's theatrical premiere. Mark Kermode called this \"stupid yet brilliant\", as it demonstrated that the distributor did not know how to market the film properly but also showed recognition that traditional marketing for a genre film was irrelevant. \"Society\" was a success in Europe, but was shelved for three years before getting a release in the U.S. Said director Yuzna in an interview: \"I think Europeans are more willing to accept the ideas that are in a movie. That's why for example \"Society\" did really well in Europe and in the US did nothing, where it was a big joke. And I think it's because they responded to the ideas in there. I was totally having fun with them, but they are there nonetheless.\"\n\nArrow Video released a limited edition Blu-ray in the UK on June 8 and in the US on June 9, 2015. It includes new interviews and artwork, a comic book sequel, and a music video by Screaming Mad George.\n\nIn 1990, \"Society\" won the Silver Raven award for \"Best Make-Up\" at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film. Tom Tunney of \"Empire\" rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Way ahead of its time, this is a balls-out satire on the disgraceful layers that can lurk just beneath the Avon surface. This is anti-\"Ferris Bueller\" and fiendishly funny.\" \"Variety\" described it as \"an extremely pretentious, obnoxious horror film that unsuccessfully attempts to introduce kinky sexual elements into extravagant makeup effects\". Michael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"No one who sees the last half-hour of this movie will ever forget it—though quite a few may want to.\" Marc Savlov of \"The Austin Chronicle\" wrote that the British press, who gave the film positive reviews, overrated it and stated that it would not play well to American audiences.\n\nIn the early 2010s, \"Time Out London\" conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. \"Society\" placed at number 95 on their top 100 list. Bartlomiej Paszylk wrote in \"The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films\" that the film has \"one of the craziest and most disgusting endings in movie history\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 55% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5/10.\n\nScottish comic book company Rough Cut Comics acquired the comic book rights to \"Society\" in 2002, producing an official sequel.\n\nThe comic book series returned in 2003 with \"Society: Party Animal\" by writer Colin Barr and artists Shelby Robertson (issue 1) and Neill Cameron (issue 2).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2325394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325394", "title": "Legal Services Corporation", "text": "Legal Services Corporation\n\nThe Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a publicly funded, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation established by the United States Congress. It seeks to ensure equal access to justice under the law for all Americans by providing funding for civil legal aid to those who otherwise would be unable to afford it. The LSC was created in 1974 with bipartisan congressional sponsorship and the support of the Nixon administration, and is funded through the congressional appropriations process.\n\nLSC has a board of eleven directors, appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate, that set LSC policy. By law the board is bipartisan; no more than six members can come from the same party. LSC has a president and other officers who implement those policies and oversee the corporation's operations.\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2018, LSC had an appropriation of $410 million in the federal budget to fund civil legal aid. LSC is the largest single funder of civil legal aid in the country, distributing more than 90 percent of its total funding to 132 independent nonprofit legal aid programs.\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2019, Congress appropriated $415 million to LSC to fund civil legal aid. LSC is the largest single funder of civil legal aid in the country, distributing more than 90 percent of its total funding to 132 independent nonprofit legal aid programs.\n\nLSC is one of the organizational descendants of the former Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO). The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, a key part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society vision, established the OEO. From 1965 on, starting with a budget of $1 million, the OEO created 269 local legal services programs around the country, such as California Rural Legal Assistance, which made a name for themselves suing local officials and sometimes stirring up resentment against their federal funding.\n\nBy the early 1970s the Nixon administration began dismantling the OEO; funding for legal services for the poor began to wither, and supporters looked for an alternative arrangement. In 1971 a bipartisan congressional group, including Senators Ted Kennedy, William A. Steiger, and Walter Mondale, proposed a national, independent Legal Services Corporation; at the same time, administration officials such as Attorney General John N. Mitchell and chief domestic advisor John Ehrlichman were proposing their own somewhat similar solution.\n\nThe idea behind the LSC was to create a new corporate entity that would be funded by Congress but run independently, with eleven board members to be appointed by the president subject to senate confirmation.\n\nLSC was created by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (). The LSC Act contains certain rules and restrictions regarding what LSC grantees can do. The initial budget was set at $90 million.\n\nNaming and confirmation of the first LSC board was delayed by inaction and opposition, but by July 1975 President Gerald R. Ford had named, and the Senate approved, the first board, with Cornell University Law School Dean Roger Conant Cramton as its first chair. Debate existed from the start among the board members as to whether LSC's role should be the OEO's one of using lawsuits and other means to attack broad underlying difficulties of the poor, or whether the focus should be more narrowly defined to addressing small, specific situations. The LSC Act said that the organization was to pursue \"equal access to justice,\" but Cramton wrote that while the law was intended to proscribe the blatantly political objects of the 1960s OEO work, it was worded ambiguously.\n\nIn December 1977, President Jimmy Carter nominated Hillary Rodham to the board of directors of the LSC, for a term to expire in July 1980. Rodham, an attorney with Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas and the wife of Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton, had a background in children's law and policy and had worked in providing legal services for the poor while at Yale Law School. She had also done 1976 campaign coordination work for Carter in Indiana. This was a recess appointment, so Rodham took her place on the board without immediate Senate confirmation. Rodham was nominated again in January 1978 as a regular appointment. In mid-1978, the Carter administration chose the thirty-year-old Rodham to become chair of the board, the first woman to become so. The position entailed her traveling monthly from Arkansas to Washington, D.C. for two-day meetings.\n\nDuring Rodham's Senate confirmation hearings, she subscribed to the philosophy that LSC should seek to reform laws and regulations that it viewed as \"unresponsive to the needs of the poor.\" Rodham was successful in getting increases in Congressional funding for LSC, stressing its usual role in providing low-income people with attorneys to assist them in commonplace legal issues and framed its funding as being neither a liberal nor a conservative cause. By her third year on the LSC board, Rodham had gotten the LSC budget tripled. Opposition to LSC during this time came from both Republican Congressman James Sensenbrenner, who favored a \"judicare\" approach of compensating private lawyers for work done for the poor, and Conservative Caucus head Howard Phillips, who objected to LSC representing gays.\n\nLSC funding was at its highest-ever mark, in inflation adjusted dollars, in fiscal 1980, with a budget of $303 million. Some 6,200 poverty lawyers filed suits using its funds on behalf of 1.5 million eligible poor clients; the lawyers won almost 80 percent of their cases, which mostly involved divorces, evictions, repossessions, and interrupted payments from federal agencies. For fiscal 1981 it was budgeted at $321 million.\n\nIn June 1980, Carter renominated Rodham for another term on the board, to expire in July 1983. Sometime between about April 1980 and September 1980, F. William McCalpin replaced her as chair of the board. He would remain chair through late 1981.\n\nLSC was strongly opposed by some political groups. As Governor of California in the 1960s, Ronald Reagan had advocated elimination of all federal subsidies for free legal services to the poor in civil cases, and had tried to block a grant to California Rural Legal Assistance in 1970. Indeed, \"Time\" magazine would state, \"Of all the social programs growing out of the Great Society, there is none that Ronald Reagan dislikes more than the Legal Services Corporation.\" CRLA's executive director would characterize Reagan's attitude towards the organization as akin to that of Darth Vader.\n\nWhen President Reagan took office in January 1981, he attempted to eliminate the LSC by zero funding it. Supporters of LSC rallied to defend it; American Bar Association president W. Reece Smith, Jr. led 200 lawyers to Washington to press its case. The U.S. House Judiciary Committee blocked Reagan's zero-funding action in May 1981, but did cut financing to $260 million for both of the next two years as well as place additional restrictions on LSC lawyers. By the following month, the now Republican-controlled U.S. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee had cut proposed financing to $100 million, as part of what \"The New York Times\" deemed an \"increasingly bitter ideological struggle\". Moreover, Reagan administration officials accused LSC of having \"concealed and understated\" its lobbying activity and support for politically motivated legislation.\n\nIn November 1981, the Reagan administration, although still hoping to eliminate LSC, decided to replace all eleven LSC board members with nominations of their own. For the new chairman they chose Ronald Zumbrun, president of the ideologically opposite Pacific Legal Foundation, which had previously defended the state of California against several legal aid lawsuits. For fiscal 1982, LSC's budget was reduced by 25 percent to $241 million, with new rules prohibiting most class action suits and lobbying. Zumbrun's nomination was sufficiently controversial that in January 1982, the Reagan administration dropped it, and instead made a recess appointment of William J. Olson to be chair. Olson had headed the Reagan transition team dealing with LSC and had personally recommended its abolition, so LSC advocates were not mollified.\n\nAt the same time, the Reagan administration had named six other board members as recess appointments. In February 1982, the Carter-appointed members of the previously existing board filed suit to against the recess appointments, claiming they were unlawful and that they should be enjoined from holding meetings. Rodham hired fellow Rose Law Firm associate Vince Foster to represent her in the case and to seek a restraining order against Reagan. The Reagan nominees may have been prohibited from meeting with the Legal Service Corporation before confirmation.\n\nRodham also prodded Senate Democrats to vote against Reagan's nominees. The nominees did undergo heavy criticism in Congress, with one labeled a bigot and Olson lambasted for his transition position. In March 1982, yet another new chair was named, Indiana University law professor William F. Harvey, although Olson would remain on the board. Harvey and Rodham had a conference call in which Rodham reiterated her desire for the lawsuit. That action, \"McCalpin v. Dana\", was decided in favor of the defendants by summary judgment in October 1982.\n\nBy December 1982, the Senate was willing to confirm six of Reagan's more moderate nominees, but not Harvey, Olson, and another; the Reagan administration instead pulled the names of all of them. This board then closed its last meeting in a public debacle, with Olson lambasting LSC as full of \"abuses and rampant illegality\" and a \"waste of the taxpayers' money through the funding of the left,\" while being harangued by a hostile audience. And too, the Reagan appointees to the board were being criticized for collecting substantially higher fees than previous board members.\n\nIn September 1983 the General Accounting Office found that in early 1981, LSC officials and its local affiliates had used federal funds in assembling opposition to Reagan's efforts to eliminate LSC, and that this use had been in violation of the LSC Act's restrictions against such political activity. Such actions against the LSC Act were not crimes, and the GAO report did not claim any crimes had taken place. The investigation had been initiated by the LSC in 1983 ordering a series of \"raids\" on their own offices to attempt to discover evidence of questionable actions taken by the LSC in 1981, prompting \"Time\" magazine to declare LSC \"an organization at war with itself.\"\n\nMore recess appointments were made by Reagan in late 1983, in 1984, and in early 1985, with again none of them being confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, LSC's board would go a total of three and a half years populated by recess appointments. Finally in June 1985 the Senate confirmed the latest batch of Reagan nominations. The Carter board lawsuit, since renamed and appealed as \"McCalpin v. Durant\" to the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, was then decided later in June 1985 as moot.\n\nOvert White House hostility towards LSC ended with the George H. W. Bush administration, with calls for level funding rather than decreases. Under board chair George Wittgraff, LSC began to ease relations with private lawyers and with state grantees. In fiscal 1992, LSC saw a funding increase back to $350 million.\n\nThe first two years of the Clinton administration saw more growth for LSC, as former chair McCalpin returned to the board and the previous former chair was now First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton. Funding rose to a high mark in absolute terms of $400 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1995.\n\nThings turned upon the advent of the Republican Revolution. In fiscal 1996, once the Republican party had taken over Congress the year prior, LSC had its funding cut again, from $400 million to $278 million. A new set of much more extensive restrictions were added to LSC grantees. The organization's supporters expressed disappointment that the Clinton administration did not make LSC a critical priority in its budget battles with the Republican Congress, especially given Hillary Clinton's former role in it.\n\nAs part of a comprehensive \"welfare reform\" of federal welfare laws beginning in 1996, most significantly the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, Congress imposed restrictions on the types of work that LSC grantee legal services organizations could engage in. For example, LSC-funded organizations could no longer serve as counsel in class action lawsuits challenging the way public benefits are administered. Additionally, LSC grantees faced tightened restrictions on representing immigrants, specifically those illegally in the country. However, in 2001, the restriction on welfare advocacy was ruled unconstitutional in \"Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez\".\n\nHowever, non-LSC funded organizations are not subject to these restrictions leading the legal services community to adopt a two-track approach: LSC restricted counsel taking on individual clients but not engaging in class actions, and non-restricted counsel (using private donor funding) both taking on individuals as well as engaging in otherwise restricted litigation. Poverty lawyers in both tracks still work together where they can, being careful not to run afoul of LSC restrictions.\n\nIn 2004, veteran Legal Aid Society attorney Helaine M. Barnett was named President of the LSC.\n\nAccording to LSC's 2009 report \"Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans,\" all legal aid offices nationwide, LSC-funded or not, were together able to meet only about 20 percent of the estimated legal needs of low-income people in the United States.\n\nFor 2007, LSC had a budget of some $350 million.\n\nIn 2009 during the Obama administration, the LSC was on the path to getting a $50 million increase in its $390 million budget.\n\nHowever, the LSC came under criticism from Senator Charles Grassley, who said, \"There's just a lot of money being wasted,\" citing several General Accounting Office and Inspector General reports.\n\nBy fiscal 2011, the annual budget amount for the LSC was $420 million. In early 2011, House now-majority Republican proposed a $75 million reduction in that current-year amount, while Obama's suggestion budget proposed a $30 million increase for the subsequent year.\n\nOn December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY 2015 that includes $375 million for LSC.\n\nSince 2017, the Trump administration has called for the elimination of funding for LSC. LSC has strong bipartisan support on behalf of robust funding for LSC. External stakeholders, including members of the legal and business communities, state attorneys general, and law school deans across the country send letters to the House and Senate appropriations committees advocating for robust funding for LSC. They include:\n\nIn addition, 209 members of the House of Representatives signed a bipartisan letter in support of funding for LSC, the largest number in history, and 46 bipartisan Senators signed a similar letter in support of funding for LSC. \n\nDue to the up-and-down nature of LSC's political history, there are many restrictions on lobbying, advocacy, and general impact work which apply to LSC-funded organizations. Here they are broken into categories of expressly forbidden, forbidden with LSC funds, and expressly permitted.\n\nRecipients may never:\n\nRecipients may, with non-LSC funding:\n\nIn many of their regulations, LSC only states activities that their funding cannot be used to support. In 45 CFR 1610.2(c)–(h), however, several different types of non-LSC funding are defined:\n\nWith these definitions in mind, 45 CFR 1610.4 goes on to specify what each type of funding can be used for:\n\nIn addition, the category of general non-LSC funds may be used to:\n\nRecipients may, with any funding:\n\nLSC is headed by an 11-member Board of Directors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. By law, the Board is bipartisan: no more than six members may be of the same political party. The current composition of the board is:\n\nThe chairs of the LSC board throughout its history have included:\n\nBy law, LSC's headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. In the 1970s and 1980s, LSC also had regional offices. LSC currently has one office in Washington D.C. that administers all of LSC's work.

They were joined a short time later by Steve Mast. The group had a mostly underground following in Chicago basements, clubs, and bars in its early years.\n\nThe band had a number-one hit song with \"Hey There Delilah\", which achieved platinum status in 2007 and earned two Grammy nominations. Their songs \"1234\" and \"Rhythm of Love\" were certified platinum in 2009 and 2011.\n\nThe Plain White T's was formed in Lombard in early 1997. The group began as a trio, with Higgenson as singer and guitarist, Fletcher on bass guitar and Tirio on drums. The group played mostly local punk shows in Chicago's suburbs, eventually having gigs at the Metro in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood. As the band began to establish itself in the local scene, a fourth member was recruited, Steve Mast, who joined playing lead guitar and sang backing vocals.\n\nHiggenson broke several vertebrae in a car crash in 1999 while driving the band's van. He was in a back brace for three months and had to learn to walk again. Higgenson changed his songwriting process, choosing songs that were more meaningful to him, and the band began taking its music career more seriously.\n\nIn 2000, the band recorded its first album, titled \"Come on Over\". In 2002, the band self-financed the recording of \"Stop\", a full-length album that attracted the attention of Fearless Records. While the band toured in support for the album, both Fletcher and Mast left and were replaced by Tim Lopez and Mike Retondo. Shortly after in 2003, Tirio decided to switch from drumming to rhythm guitar and a new drummer named De'Mar Hamilton was added to the line-up.\n\nThe 2005 release, \"All That We Needed\", was the first studio album from the reformed line-up, and featured the single \"Hey There Delilah\". In 2006 the band signed to Hollywood Records and recorded \"Every Second Counts\", featuring a new version of \"Hey There Delilah\" with a string section. \"Every Second Counts\" was released in September 2006. That same year, \"Hey There Delilah\" reached #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart for two weeks. The song was written for the track star Delilah DiCrescenzo, whom Higgenson had met in 2002. The song received two Grammy nominations, and \"Every Second Counts\" was certified gold. In early 2006, the band teamed up with Motion City Soundtrack for a winter/spring tour.\n\nIn 2008, the group released the album \"Big Bad World\". The album had two hit singles: \"1, 2, 3, 4\" and \"Natural Disaster\". Both were on the American Top 40 at numbers 1 and 2 for three consecutive weeks. By late 2008, the band had joined the \"Rock Band Live\" tour with Panic! at the Disco, Dashboard Confessional and The Cab. Later that year, the band played at the Give It a Name festival in the UK. In 2007, the band performed the single \"Our Time Now\" on an episode of the Nickelodeon television series, \"iCarly\". \"Our Time Now\" was also played in commercials for the ABC Family dramedy series, \"Greek\".\n\nThe band's \"Rhythm of Love\" single was the first to be released from the group's 2010 album, \"The Wonders of the Younger\". The song reached number five on the Hot AC chart, and was in the top ten in 2010 as well. In 2012, the band also covered The Ramones' \"Pet Sematary\" for the song soundtrack of the 2012 Disney film \"Frankenweenie\". \"Should've Gone to Bed\", a four-song EP, was released on April 9, 2013.\n\nThe band left Hollywood Records after creative conflicts with the label during the production of the \"American Nights\" album. \"American Nights\" was released by Megaforce Records on March 31, 2015. The release date of \"American Nights\" was pushed back several times by their former record label, Hollywood Records. In 2015, they also appeared on Blues Traveler's album \"Blow Up the Moon\", co-writing the song \"Nikkia's Prom.\" On November 22, 2015, the band released a music video for \"American Nights\" featuring Higgenson's son, Lennon.\n\nIn May 2017, Plain White T's released a music video for their song \"Land of the Living.\" The band, which had left their label Fearless in 2005, returned to the label.

{"id": "2325404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325404", "title": "Nang Nak", "text": "Nang Nak\n\nNang Nak () is a romantic tragedy and horror film based on the Thai legend of Mae Nak Phra Khanong. It was directed by Nonzee Nimibutr and released in 1999 by Buddy Film and Video Production Co. in Thailand. It depicts the life of a devoted ghost wife and her unsuspecting husband.\n\nIn a rural village west of Bangkok, Mak (Winai Kraibutr) is conscripted and sent to fight in the Siamese-Vietnamese War (1831–1834). He has to leave behind his pregnant teenage wife, Nak (Intira Jaroenpura). Mak is wounded and barely survives. He eventually returns home to his beloved wife and their child.\n\nA friend visits and sees Mak living with Nak. The villagers, knowing she had died months earlier, realize Mak is spellbound by her ghost. But those who attempt to tell him are killed in the night by Nak's ghost, who is desperate to stay with her husband. When Mak confronts Nak about the rumors, she lies and says the villagers disliked her after he left for the war. She claims they are also telling lies about their son not being Mak's. Mak believes her and lashes out at anyone who tells him she is dead.\n\nMak eventually discovers the truth. Crawling under their house one night to retrieve an item, he trips on something sticking up from the dirt. Curious, he digs it up and finds a corpse making him wonder why Nak would always prevent him from going down there. Looking up through the creaks of the wood floor, he sees Nak sitting and brushing her hair. Dropping the comb through a crack, her arm eerily extends all the way to the ground to retrieve it. Mak covers his mouth to stifle a scream and continues observing Nak. Nak picks up her crying baby, who Mak realises is a corpse as well. A series of flashbacks reveal that Nak had a difficult childbirth and both mother and child died from complications. Mak flees in terror to the local temple to hide. Nak follows him and attempts to win him back, but he is too frightened of her. The villagers attempt to drive out Nak, burning down her house and at last summoning an exorcist. Nak refuses to leave unless Mak returns to her. Mak pleads with her to leave to the netherworld. He loves her, but they can't be together since she is dead. He tells her that he is going to cut his hair and become a monk in order to pray for her sins and allow her spirit to find peace. She still refuses.\n\nThe kingdom's most respected Buddhist monk, Somdej Toh, intervenes and, in a tearful farewell, Nak repents, leaving her husband for this life. The monk has the centre of her forehead cut out, thus releasing her spirit, and makes a girdle brooch of it. The epilogue states it later came into the possession of Prince Chumbhorn Ketudomsak. It was thereafter handed down for generations, with its current owner unknown.\n\nThe allegedly true story of Mae Nak Phra Khanong is Thailand's most popular ghost tale. A popular shrine dedicated to her at is at On Nut, Sukhumvit Soi 77 in Bangkok's Suan Luang (formerly Phra Khanong) District.\n\nThe old tale has been depicted on film many times since the silent era, one of the most famous being \"Mae Nak Pra Kanong\" in 1958. Even after the 1999 version, British filmmaker Mark Duffeld directed a remake in 2005 called \"Ghost of Mae Nak\". There also is an opera, \"Mae Nak\", by Thai composer Somtow Sucharitkul.\n\nAnother retelling of the Nak legend is \"Pee Mak Phrakanong\" (2013), a film directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun, which relates the story from the husband's viewpoint. The film surpassed one billion baht in box office revenue, Thailand's highest grossing film to date.\n\nThe film opened in cinemas on 23 July 1999. It was wildly popular and became the first Thai film to earn 100 million baht at the box office. In an era of 100 baht cinema tickets it would go on to earn more than 150 million baht. In 2019, on the 20th anniversary of its original release, it was re-released in digital format to select cinemas.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2325412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325412", "title": "Le Plateau-Mont-Royal", "text": "Le Plateau-Mont-Royal\n\nLe Plateau-Mont-Royal () is a borough (\"arrondissement\") of the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe Plateau-Mont-Royal takes its name from its location on relatively flat terrain north of Sherbrooke Street and downtown, and east of Mont-Royal. The borough is bordered to the north and north-east by the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks; to the west by Hutchison (north of Mount Royal Avenue), Park Avenue (between Mount Royal and Pine Avenue) and University Street (south of Pine Avenue); and to the south by Sherbrooke Street. It is the most densely populated borough in Canada, with 101,054 people living in an 8.1 square kilometre area.\n\nThere is a difference between the borough, Plateau-Mont-Royal—a political division of the City of Montreal—and the neighbourhood referred to as \"the Plateau\". The borough includes not only the Plateau proper, but also the neighbourhoods of Mile End (bounded by Avenue du Mont-Royal to the south and the Avenue Henri-Julien to the east) and Milton Park (bounded by University, Sherbrooke, Saint-Laurent and Pine). Both neighbourhoods are generally considered distinct from the Plateau.\n\nStarting in 1745, the urbanized area of Montreal began to extend beyond its fortifications. The Plateau Mont-Royal was born when the Faubourg Saint-Laurent to the north became the main line of development. In 1792, Montreal expanded to establish its official limits about two kilometres around the original fortifications. Therefore, Mount Royal and Duluth Street formed its boundaries. Farther from the centre, especially to the west, English-speaking families of the era owned large houses surrounded by gardens and the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph owned a large field which would be the site of the future Hôtel-Dieu. Further from the city are large country estates whose farms are owned by the Montreal bourgeoisie.\n\nIn 1850, a reservoir was installed in what is today the location of Saint-Louis Square. It had the function of supplying water to Côte-à-Baron residents, who lived on the downward slope below Sherbrooke Street. At that time a farm on the site of the current La Fontaine Park was converted into a field of military manoeuvres. To the north, other cities were formed following new economic activity, giving rise to the village of Coteau-Saint-Louis in 1846. A chapel was built two years later to be replaced in 1857 by the Church of Saint-Enfant-Jésus du Mile-End. Nowadays, Mile End is a neighbourhood adjacent to part of the Plateau Mont-Royal, but it was only in 1878 that the village of Saint-Louis-du-Mile-End was born. By the end of the century, the mountain was purchased by the City of Montreal which developed Mount Royal Park. La Fontaine Park took the place of the military field and the reservoir serving Côte-à-Baron gave way to St. Louis Square.\n\nThe village of Saint-Jean-Baptiste formed circa 1861. Its central point is also the location of the market (the first market was built in 1870 and replaced by a more modern market in 1933, which was demolished in 1966). The civic centre was located at the intersection of Saint Lawrence Street (later Saint Laurent Boulevard) and Rachel Street. The villages of Coteau-Saint-Louis and Saint-Jean-Baptiste merged into Montreal in 1893 and 1886 respectively. As for Saint-Louis-du-Mile-End and DeLorimier, they would be annexed to Montreal in 1910 and 1909 respectively. At that time, the population of Montreal spilled over east of Papineau Road (today Papineau Avenue), where elegant houses and avenues were located.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, it was a working class neighbourhood. Over the years, spurred by economic growth, the working class population gradually deserted the area. By 1900, Coteau-Saint-Louis had become very cosmopolitan, and counted several Protestant churches and synagogues. Several Protestant traders opened shop on St. Lawrence Street (renamed St. Lawrence Boulevard in 1905). St. Lawrence was the linguistic border between the French-speaking east, and English-speaking west. At that time, Saint Joseph Boulevard became the first tree-lined street in the city.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Great Depression slowed construction in the district, although some work resulted in the funding for the landscaping of Sir Wilfrid Laurier Park. The Université de Montréal moved to the northern slope of Mount Royal in 1943, resulting in the relocation of both the English and French bourgeoisie to this neighbourhood. Immigrants settled increasingly in the neighbourhood in the post-war period. Jews operated several boutiques on St. Lawrence Boulevard and moved into the adjacent neighbourhoods to the west. Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen, established in 1928, is still one of the most famous shops in Montreal, famous for its Montreal-style smoked meat sandwiches. Greek Canadians set up many businesses in the decades that followed, particularly along Park Avenue and contributed to the local art of baking and pastry. More recently, Vietnamese and Portuguese settled in the area, as evidenced, for the latter, by Little Portugal.\n\nIn the 1980s, the area's bohemian aura and proximity to McGill University attracted gentrification. As rents increased, many of its traditional residents and businesses were dispersed to other parts of the city. The neighbourhood continues to gentrify, and it is now home to many upscale restaurants and nightclubs, and several trendy clothing stores are located along St. Laurent Blvd. and St. Denis St.\n\nThe borough is located northeast of downtown, and was part of the City of Montreal prior to the 2002 municipal mergers.\n\nIt is bordered to the south by Ville-Marie, to the west by Outremont, and to the north and east by Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie. Clockwise from the south, it is bounded by Sherbrooke St., University St., Pine Ave. (av. des Pins), Park Ave. (Avenue du Parc), the southward projection of Hutchison St., Hutchison St., and the CP railroad tracks.\n\nThe Plateau began as a bourgeois community with parts of its extensions as working-class developing around the beginning of the 20th century; the Eastern part being largely Québécois, and the Western part primarily European with a total visible minority estimated at 17%. The neighbourhood was the childhood home of Quebec writers Michel Tremblay and Mordecai Richler and both have set many stories in the Plateau of the 1950s and 60s. The Plateau is currently a creative family oriented upper-middle-class neighbourhood. Although the Eastern part is still largely Québécois, the Plateau (now nicknamed \"La Nouvelle-France\") is emerging as a French enclave of those fleeing Paris' transitioning cultural climate.\n\nThe Plateau is characterized by brightly coloured houses, cafés, book shops, and a laissez-faire attitude that embraces its bohemian nature over the commercialized hipster culture of its Mile-End counterpart.\nIt's the location of some famous attractions on Saint Laurent Boulevard, including Schwartz's Deli (famous for its Montreal smoked meat), and a weekend street fair during the summer that sees extremely crowded streets. In 1997, \"Utne Reader\" rated it one of the 15 \"hippest\" neighbourhoods in North America.\n\nThe plateau has the highest concentration of youths living there, with an average age of 34, and an overall average age range of 25–34 years old. The average number of people per household is 1.7. 53% live alone. In 2011, approximately half of the families living in the plateau have no children.\n\nAs of the 2011 census, 49% of the people living in the Plateau had immigrated from elsewhere, or their parents had migrated from outside of Montreal. A majority of the immigrants were found to be from France and Portugal. In addition, 16% of its occupants belong to visible minority groups.\n\nThe average income for individuals living in this area is $37,500, and average income for a household is $56,072. Families make an average income of $83,803. Single parent families have an average annual income of $52,683.\n\nFollowing the November 5, 2017 Montreal municipal election and an October 6, 2019 by-election for borough mayor, the current borough council consists of the following councillors:\n\nThe borough is divided among the following federal ridings:\n\n\nIt is divided among the following provincial electoral districts:\n\n\nThe Commission scolaire de Montréal (CSDM) operates Francophone public schools and the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) operates Anglophone public schools in the borough. The two school boards jointly operate F.A.C.E. School, a bilingual art-oriented school located in the Milton Park neighbourhood.\n\nMcGill University maintains a significant presence in the borough, including four residence halls, Presbyterian College and the Steinberg Centre for Simulation and Interactive Learning.\n\nThe borough has two libraries of the Montreal Public Libraries Network: Mile End and Plateau-Mont-Royal.\n\nOverlooked by the eastern face of Mount Royal, the borough is served by part of the orange line of the Montreal metro, including Sherbrooke, Mont-Royal, and Laurier stations.\n\nImportant features of the borough include the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, Lafontaine Park, and Jeanne Mance Park.\n\nThe borough is largely composed of the well-known Plateau neighbourhood, famous for its bohemian reputation and characteristic architecture. The neighbourhoods of Mile End, Côte Saint-Louis, and Milton-Parc (including the McGill Ghetto) are also located in the borough.\n\nMontreal's Little Portugal neighbourhood is situated in the western portion of the borough.\n\nLe Plateau-Mont-Royal borough council has undertaken various renaturalisation and traffic-calming projects in recent years under the leadership of borough Mayor Luc Ferrandez. The reconstruction of intersections now usually involves constructing road-diets (where vehicular traffic space has been reduced) in favour of wider sidewalks and large naturalised areas with grasses, flowers and other indigenous plant species. The renaturalisation of some alleyways has been realised through the removal of asphalt or concrete along the edge of property lines for soil; local residents can plant whatever they choose. \nMany streets underwent one-directional reassignments, to the irritation of local and visiting motorists; Ferrandez has faced criticism for what some feel to be drastic changes resulting in decreased vehicular and pedestrian traffic for merchants on main thoroughfares.\n\n\n"}

This style of sunglasses has become a wide phenomenon, usually being referred to as \"shutter shades\". As of 2000, Mikli's firm employed 220 people with sales of approx. FF220 million. Around 500,000 pairs of Mikli glasses have been sold worldwide.\n\nOn 23 January 2013 Alain Mikli International was bought by Italian eyewear giant Luxottica for around 90 million euros.\n\n"}
{"id": "2325431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325431", "title": "Space Station Silicon Valley", "text": "Space Station Silicon Valley\n\nSpace Station Silicon Valley is a platform video game developed by DMA Design and published by Take-Two Interactive. It was originally released for the Nintendo 64 in October 1998. An adaption of the game for Game Boy Color was developed by Tarantula Studios and released in 1999. A PlayStation port, developed by Runecraft, was released in 2000, under the name Evo's Space Adventures. Players control Evo, a robot reduced to a crawling microchip after a ship crash, and are tasked with taking control of animals to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\n\nThe game began development in September 1995, as part of a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.\n\nUpon release, \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts. It won numerous awards, including Game of the Month and Most Innovative Game from IGN. Despite this, the game performed poorly commercially, and was unable to secure enough sales to warrant a sequel.\n\n\"Space Station Silicon Valley\" is a platform game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. During the game, players control Evo—a robot who is reduced to a crawling microchip during a ship crash, and is losing energy at a steady rate without protection. In order to survive, players attack animals, which disables them and allows players to assume control of their bodies. Each animal possesses different characteristics, including survival rate and special attacks, and uses different abilities; for example, large animals such as bears are able to destroy ice blocks, which other animals are incapable of doing so. Some animals are also unable to survive in certain unfamiliar environments, forcing players to enter the body of another. The animals are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level, collecting Evo's power cells to maintain energy.\n\nDuring the game, players are frequently accompanied by the voice of Dan Danger, a human who is trapped in the destroyed spaceship. Dan assigns missions to players, occasionally commenting on their performance. The game is set on a space station—the titular Silicon Valley, which consists of four environments: Euro Eden, Arctic Kingdom, Jungle Safari, and Desert Adventure. The environments are unlocked as players progress through the game. Each environment consists of numerous sub-levels, ranging from six to ten, each of which task players with certain objectives; examples include activating switches, disabling electric fences, and gathering a set number of objects. As players progress through the levels, they collect the scattered remains of Evo's protective shell suit, eventually re-assembling them for the final level. Each level also contains a hidden objective, such as collecting a souvenir or making an animal perform a certain act; as players complete the hidden objectives, they are rewarded with a gold trophy, and collecting all trophies unlocks a bonus level.\n\nIn the year 2001, the space station Silicon Valley was launched, housing numerous animals. Seven minutes after its launch, it vanished. Believed to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation. Following this, the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station's technology, resulting in animals such as an electronically-powered fox with motorised wheels, and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Evo sets out to fix the control station, which is on a collision course with Earth. Upon arriving at the control room, Evo confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals. The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth, but is quickly defeated by Evo. Despite this, Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control; it collides with Earth, landing in New York Harbor. The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City, and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet.\n\n\"Space Station Silicon Valley\" began development in September 1995, as part of a three-game publishing deal between developer DMA Design and BMG Interactive, the other games being \"Grand Theft Auto\" (1997) and \"Tanktics\" (1999). All three games were planned to be released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Saturn, as they were the most popular platforms at the time. Following Take-Two Interactive's acquisition of BMG Interactive in March 1998, Take-Two acquired the publishing rights to the game, and the team instead changed focus to develop the game for the Nintendo 64, upon discovering that Windows was incapable of processing the models and environments intended for use. Every member of the team that developed \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" began working at DMA Design at the beginning of development, in September 1995. Development began using the then-new DirectX libraries, following the release of Windows 95. The levels were designed and edited using Silicon Graphics computers, which were transferred directly to the Nintendo 64 development boards. The team found the Nintendo 64 to be more advanced than previous hardware; programmer Grant Salvona described the development kits as \"the most powerful hardware available in the building\".\n\nThe game's humour and style were shaped by hardware limitations; when the hardware rendered the character models in soft focus, the team noted that they resembled Plasticine models, and continued to create the game with a look and style akin to \"Wallace and Gromit\". The game was presented with \"distinctive 'British' humour\" to distinguish it from other games; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games, such as \"Super Mario 64\" (1996), to identify the differences. The team ensured that each level felt distinct, while maintaining a coherent style. This diversity was achieved using the development tools, which allowed various members of the team to experiment in creating designs. Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game's music provided freedom to the team, as it \"doesn't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen\". He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the \"cheesy, slightly twisted B-movies animation kind of feel\". Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former, stating that \"people who are doing music for CD-based systems get very, very lazy\".\n\nWhile similar body-swapping games already existed, such as \"Paradroid\" (1985), they had little influence on the development of \"Space Station Silicon Valley\". The team were instead influenced by other games in development at DMA, including \"Grand Theft Auto\" and \"Body Harvest\" (1998). Unlike those games, \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" does not take place in an open world; \"they're a bugger to make,\" explained creative director Gary Penn. The objective of the team was to create a game where players were encouraged to try new things to see the outcome. The original concept for the game was that players would eat robots and become increasingly larger, retrospectively described by creative director lead artist Jamie Bryan as being similar to \"\" (2002). Another early idea was for the in-game animals to consist of different parts, and destroying one animal would allow players to swap some features with their existing body; this was quickly discarded, as the team realised it would require extensive testing.\n\nThe game was developed with little interference from upper management; programmer Obbe Vermeij said that \"only after 18 months was there a push to get everything together into a finished game\". \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" entered beta in August 1998, and was first released for Nintendo 64 on 21 October 1998. Baglow attributed the lengthy development cycle to the scale of the game, stating that \"it's got to be fun\". A Game Boy Color version of the game—a 2D remake of the original version—was released in Europe in late 1999; IGN's Tim Jones was critical of the port, criticising the gameplay and level design. The game was also ported to the PlayStation by Runecraft in June 2000, under the title \"Evo's Space Adventures\", although the original development team had little input besides providing the models, codes and textures; a review by criticised the port's poor gameplay and graphics, and it has elsewhere been described as \"one of the laziest ports in the history of video games\".\n\n\"Space Station Silicon Valley\" was well received by critics. Review aggregator Metacritic calculated an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 10 reviews, for the Nintendo 64 version. Metacritic ranks the game within the top 10 Nintendo 64 games released in 1998. Praise was particularly directed at the game's intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts. The game was also applauded for the originality of its concept; IGN's Matt Casamassina called \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" \"maybe the most original game to hit Nintendo 64\", and \"Next Generation\" named it \"one of the very best Nintendo 64 has to offer\".\n\nCritics lauded the gameplay. Casamassina of IGN called it \"nearly flawless\", while \"Next Generation\" named it \"a satisfying challenge\". A reviewer from Game Revolution noted that the game \"keeps the emphasis on gameplay\", particularly appreciating the attention to detail, however noted inconveniences in the camera. Lauren Fielder of GameSpot felt that the game's puzzles were very simple to decipher, but noted that the game accomplishes its goal of entertaining and amusing players. Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" found the game \"monotonous\", and the missions to be \"immensely boring\".\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" named the level design \"superb\", praising the variety and open-ended approach of the levels. Dan Hsu of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" echoed similar remarks, applauding the game's preparation for contingencies, and \"Daily Radar\"s Max Everingham described the levels as \"innovative\". Game Revolution disliked the inability to save the game mid-level, but otherwise appreciated the variety of the levels, while a reviewer for \"Game Informer\" found the levels to be \"fairly small\".\n\nGame Revolution wrote that the game has \"some of the best sound yet\" for a Nintendo 64 game, praising the variety of the musical tracks. IGN's Casamassina found the music \"very well executed\" and \"very entertaining\", likening it to \"'futuristic space pop' and elevator-like tunes\", and named the sound effects \"equally satisfying\". Conversely, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Hsu found the music \"ultra-annoying\". For the PlayStation version of the game, in which the original music is replaced, John Szczepaniak of \"Hardcore Gaming 101\" said that it \"sucks\", writing that \"the elevator style music is made even more obnoxious, and some of the really good tunes ... have been replaced with awful generic heavy metal\".\n\nIGN's Casamassina found that the game \"lacks the graphic finesse of a title like \"Banjo-Kazooie\"\", but praised it nonetheless, while GameSpot's Lauren Fielder called the graphics \"nothing special\". Game Revolution praised the graphics, particularly applauding the smooth textures and vibrant colour palette, as well as the detail of the character movement. \"Next Generation\" felt that the game \"doesn't push Nintendo 64's hardware to the limits\", and noted some occasional frame rate slowdown, but appreciated the \"cute\" and simplistic design. Jon Storm of \"Game Informer\" called the graphics \"lame\", criticising the lack of detail in the environments and characters. In a retrospective feature, Craig Owens of \"Nintendo Gamer\" wrote that the game's \"chunky, angular\" art style conveys the \"experimental, unpredictable tone\".\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" presented \"Space Station Silicon Valley\" the Silver Editor's Choice Award. It was named IGN's Game of the Month for October 1998, and in February 1999 it won Most Innovative Game from IGN, who praised it for capturing \"old-school\" gameplay mechanics. In January 2007, IGN placed the game fifth on a list of \"Underrated and Underappreciated Games\", and in April 2009 placed it on a list of \"Nintendo 64 Treasures\", stating that it \"remains one of the great unsung heroes\" of the console. Despite its critical success, the game failed to match expected sales, and was unable to earn enough money to warrant a sequel. The team attributed the poor commercial performance to the game's simultaneous launch with \"\", which was Nintendo's marketing focus at the time.\n\nNotes\nReferences \nSources\n"}

He was brought up both in Manchester and nearby Urmston and was educated at Manchester Grammar School. He attended London's Central School of Speech and Drama, in the company of fellow students Laurence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft.\n\nCoulouris made his stage debut in 1926 with \"Henry V\" at the Old Vic. By 1929, he made his first Broadway appearance, followed by his first Hollywood film role in 1933.\n\nA major impact on his life was Orson Welles, whom he met in 1936 when they both had roles in the Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley's \"Ten Million Ghosts\". Welles invited Coulouris to become a charter member of his Mercury Theatre, and in 1937 Coulouris performed the role of Mark Antony in the company's debut production, \"Caesar\", an innovative modern-dress production of Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\".\n\n\"Even 'Friends, Romans, countrymen' sounds on his tongue as if it were a rabble-rousing harangue he is uttering for the first time,\" noted John Mason Brown in the \"New York Post\".\n\nIn 1938, he appeared in the Mercury stage productions of \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\" and \"Heartbreak House\", and became part of the repertory company that presented CBS Radio's \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and its sponsored continuation, \"The Campbell Playhouse\" (1938–40). Also for CBS, in 1944 he starred in the radio series \"Suspense\", in the episode \"Portrait without a Face\".\n\nIn \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), Coulouris played Walter Parks Thatcher, a financier similar to J. P. Morgan. Coulouris and Welles each received a 1941 National Board of Review Award for their performances.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Coulouris remained a regular figure on the stage and screen, starring in his own Broadway production of \"Richard III\" in 1943. His films in this period included \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1943), \"Between Two Worlds\" (1944), \"Mr. Skeffington\" (1944) and \"Watch on the Rhine\" (1943), in which he repeated the role he originated in the Broadway production. He also performed as Robert de Baudricourt in \"Joan of Arc\" (1948), starring Ingrid Bergman. While most of his performances are strong ones, usually as a heavy or villain, occasionally he could turn his serious characterizations into humorous ones. Thatcher in \"Citizen Kane\" is fussy and pompous at times. A better (if briefer) example was in \"Mr. Skeffington\" as Dr. Byles, planning to go on a well-deserved, long-delayed holiday only to find it delayed again by a selfish, impossible Fanny Skeffington (Bette Davis).\n\nCoulouris was the first actor to star in the title role of the \"Bulldog Drummond\" programme on the Mutual Broadcasting System.\n\nCoulouris returned to Britain after 1950, living first in Putney and later in Hampstead. He appeared in more films, theatre and television productions. His stage work was the most well regarded and included the title role in \"King Lear\" at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre (1952); the lead (Dr. Stockmann) in \"An Enemy of the People\" (1959) at the Arts Theatre, Cambridge; Peter Flynn in Seán O'Casey's \"The Plough and the Stars\" at the Mermaid Theatre (1962); a part in August Strindberg's \"The Dance of Death\"; and Big Daddy in Tennessee Williams's \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1970).\n\nLater film roles included parts in \"The Heart of the Matter\" (1953), \"Doctor in the House\" (1954), \"Papillon\" (1973), \"Mahler\" and \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (both 1974). He had rare leading roles in the British horror movies \"The Man Without a Body\" (1957) and \"The Woman Eater\" (1958).\n\nHe played in over 80 films, but radio roles were also numerous, and his television roles included parts in \"Danger Man\" and \"The Prisoner\" (\"Checkmate\", 1967). Other appearances included the recurring role of science writer Harcourt Brown in the ABC serials, \"Pathfinders to Mars\" and \"Pathfinders to Venus\", which were sequels to earlier serials; \"Target Luna\" and \"Pathfinders in Space\". He appeared as Arbitan in the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Keys of Marinus\" (1964).\n\nCoulouris was married to Louise Franklin (1930–1976) and Elizabeth Donaldson (1977–1989) and was the father of computer scientist George Coulouris and artist Mary Louise Coulouris.\n\nCoulouris died in London on 25 April 1989, of heart failure following Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn \"Me and Orson Welles\" (2008), Richard Linklater's period drama set in the days surrounding the premiere of the Mercury Theatre's production of \"Caesar\", Coulouris is portrayed by Ben Chaplin.\n\nGeorge Coulouris's Broadway credits are listed at the Internet Broadway Database.\n\n\n\n"}

The famous Khoo Kongsi is the grandest clan temple in the country. It is also one of the city's major historic attractions. The clan temple has retained its authentic historic setting, which includes an association building, a traditional theatre and the late 19th century rowhouses for clan members, all clustered around a granite-paved square. It is located in Cannon Square in the heart of the oldest part of the city of George Town, in the midst of narrow, winding lanes and quaint-looking pre-War houses exuding a palpable old world charm.\n\nThe Khoo Kongsi is a clan association of the Leong San Tong (Dragon Mountain Hall) clan, whose forefathers came from Xiancheng in Fujian province. The Khoos were among the wealthy Straits Chinese traders of 17th century Malacca and early Penang. In the 19th century, the clan complex resembled a miniature clan village, with its own self-government as well as educational, financial, welfare and social organisations. The clan temple was built in 1906 when the Khoo clan was at the height of wealth and eminence in Penang society.\n\nThe forefathers of the Khoo family who emigrated from South China built it as a clanhouse for members of the Khoo family in 1851. It was burnt down in 1901, allegedly struck by lightning, and the Chinese believed that it was due to its resemblance to the Emperor's palace, which provoked the gods. A scaled-down version was later built in 1902 and completed in 1906.\nEven so, the complex boasts a magnificent hall embellished with intricate carvings and richly ornamented beams of the finest wood bearing the mark of master craftsmen from China. The clan temple is dedicated to the clan's patron deities and also houses a collection of ancestral tablets. Chinese operas are still staged at the theatre during the seventh lunar month.\n\nLike many such clan associations in South East Asia, Khoo Kongsi is no longer the center of important social activities and functions that it once held. Different strategies and ideas are being implemented to redefine the place of clan associations in the 21st century. Due to its location in the UNESCO World Heritage area of George Town, it is a popular attraction for tourists interested in local culture.\n\n"}

Situated in Kelawei Road, the temple located close to the Dhammikarama Burmese Temple. It is the oldest Malaysian Siamese temple in the state. The temple became a focal point for the annual Siamese Songkran and Loi Krathong festivals within the city suburb and for the city yearly Buddha Day procession.\n\nThe site for the temple was cleared in 1795 after a piece of land was granted to both Burmese and Siamese community in George Town by Queen Victoria during the Straits Settlements era. In 1830, there is around 648 Burmese and Siamese out of the 40,000 population. Part of the land awarded to the Siamese is given as a diplomatic gesture to promote trading ties between the British Empire and the Siamese Rattanakosin Kingdom, which was presented by the then Governor of the Straits Settlements, William John Butterworth to two Siamese female trustees named Nankayo and Boonsoon as the community representative. Inscriptions also showed that the building of the temple had been largely due to the philanthropic efforts of local Chinese Buddhists.\n\nIn 1845, the temple was founded in the given land by Phra Phorthan Kuad, a powerful monk which according to the local legend was also very fond of \"asam laksa\". This subsequently making the dish become a norm offerings by devotees when visiting his shrine in the temple. In 1948, the temple officially named as \"Wat Chayamangkalaram\".

{"id": "2325477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325477", "title": "Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea", "text": "Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea\n\nAnne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea (\"née\" Kingsmill; April 16615 August 1720), was an English poet and courtier. Finch's works often express a desire for respect as a female poet, lamenting her difficult position as a woman in the literary establishment and the court, while writing of \"political ideology, religious orientation, and aesthetic sensibility\". Her works also allude to other female authors of the time, such as Aphra Behn and Katherine Phillips. Through her commentary on the mental and spiritual equality of the genders and the importance of women fulfilling their potential as a moral duty to themselves and to society, she is regarded as one of the integral female poets of the Restoration Era. Finch died in Westminster in 1720 and was buried at her home at Eastwell, Kent.\n\nFinch was born Anne Kingsmill in April 1661 in Sydmonton, Hampshire, in southern England. Her parents were Sir William Kingsmill and Anne Haslewood, both heralding from old and powerful families. She was the youngest of three children, her siblings being William and Bridget Kingsmill. The young Anne never knew her father, as he died only five months after she was born. In his will, he specified that his daughters receive financial support equal to that of their brother for their education, which was an \"unusually enlightened view for the times\".\n\nHer mother remarried in 1662, to Sir Thomas Ogle, and later bore Anne Kingsmill's half-sister, Dorothy Ogle. Anne would remain close to Dorothy for most of their lives, inspiring poems such as \"Some Reflections: In a Dialogue Between Teresa and Ardelia\" and \"To my Sister Ogle\".\n\nFinch's mother died in 1664. Shortly before her death she wrote a will giving control of her estate to her second husband. The will was successfully challenged in a Court of Chancery by Anne Kingsmill's uncle, William Haslewood. Subsequently, Anne and Bridget Kingsmill lived with their grandmother, Lady Kingsmill, in Charing Cross, London, while their brother lived with his uncle William Haslewood.\n\nIn 1670, Lady Kingsmill filed her own Court of Chancery suit, demanding from William Haslewood a share in the educational and support monies for Anne and Bridget. The court split custody and financial support between Haslewood and Lady Kingsmill. When Lady Kingsmill died in 1672, Anne and Bridget rejoined their brother to be raised by Haslewood. The sisters received a comprehensive and progressive education, something that was uncommon for females at the time, and Anne Kingsmill learned about Greek and Roman mythology, the Bible, French and Italian languages, history, poetry, and drama.\n\nIn 1682, Anne Kingsmill was sent to St James's Palace to become a maid of honour to Mary of Modena (wife of James, Duke of York, who later became King James II). There she met the courtier Heneage Finch, whom she married on 15 May 1684. It was a happy marriage and Anne wrote several love poems to her husband, most famous perhaps \"A Letter to Daphnis\", though her most well-known works speak on her bouts of depression and her fervent belief in social justice for women.\n\nThe sisters remained in the Haslewood household until their uncle's death in 1682. 21 years old at the time, Anne Kingsmill then went to live at St James's Palace, joining the court of Charles II. She became one of six maids of honour to Mary of Modena, who was the wife of James, Duke of York, who would later become King James II.\n\nApparently, Anne's interest in poetry began at the palace, and she started writing her own verse. Her friends included Sarah Churchill and Anne Killigrew, two other maids of honour who also shared poetic interests. However, when Anne Kingsmill witnessed the derision within the court that greeted Killigrew's poetic efforts (poetry was not a pursuit considered suitable for women), she decided to keep her own writing attempts to herself and her close friends. She remained secretive about her poetry until much later in her life, when she was encouraged to publish under her own name.\n\nWhile residing at court, Anne Kingsmill met Colonel Heneage Finch, the man who would become her husband. A courtier as well as a soldier, Colonel Finch had been appointed Groom of the Bedchamber to James, Duke of York, in 1683. His family had strong Royalist connections, as well as a pronounced loyalty to the Stuart dynasty, and his grandmother had become the Countess of Winchilsea in 1628. Finch met Kingsmill and fell in love with her, but she at first resisted his romantic overtures. However, Finch proved a persistent suitor, and the couple was finally married on 15 May 1684.\n\nUpon her marriage, Anne Finch resigned her court position, but her husband retained his own appointment and would serve in various government positions. As such, the couple remained involved in court life. During the 1685 coronation of James II, Heneage Finch carried the canopy of the Queen, Mary of Modena, who had specifically requested his service.\n\nThe couple's marriage proved to be enduring and happy, in part due to the aspects of equality in their partnership. Indeed, part of the development of her poetic skills was brought about by expressing her joy in her love for her husband and the positive effects of his lack of patriarchal impingement on her artistic development. These early works, many written to her husband (such as \"A Letter to Dafnis: April 2d 1685\"), celebrated their relationship and ardent intimacy. In expressing herself in such a fashion, Anne Finch quietly defied contemporary social conventions. In other early works she aimed a satiric disapproval at prevailing misogynistic attitudes. Still, her husband strongly supported her writing activities.\n\nDespite their court connections, Anne and Heneage Finch led a rather sedate life. At first they lived in Westminster; then, as Heneage Finch became more involved in public affairs, they moved to London. His involvement had increased when James II took the throne in 1685. The couple demonstrated great loyalty to the king in what turned out to be a brief reign.\n\nJames II was deposed in 1688 during the \"Bloodless Revolution\". During his short reign, James fell under intense criticism for his autocratic manner of rule. Eventually, he fled England for exile in Saint-Germain, France. As a result, the British Parliament offered William of Orange the English crown. When the new monarchs, William and Mary, assumed the throne, oaths of allegiance became a requirement for both the public and the clergy. William and Mary were Protestants, and the Finches remained loyal to the Catholic Stuart court, refusing to take the oath. They also viewed their oaths to the previous monarchy as morally binding and constant. But such a stance invited trouble. Heneage Finch lost his government position and retreated from public life. As the loss of his position entailed a loss of income, the Finches were forced to live with friends in London for a period. However, while living in the city the couple faced harassment, fines and potential imprisonment.\n\nIn April 1690, Heneage Finch was arrested and charged with Jacobitism for attempting to join the exiled James II in France. It was a difficult time for Jacobites and Nonjurors (those who had refused to take the oath of allegiance, such as the Finches), as their arrests and punishments were abusive. Because of his arrest, Heneage and Anne Finch remained separated from April until November of that year. The circumstances caused the couple a great deal of emotional turmoil. Living with friends in Kent while her husband prepared his defence in London, Anne Finch often succumbed to bouts of depression, something that afflicted her for most of her adult life. The poems that she wrote during this period, such as \"Ardelia to Melancholy,\" reflected her mental state. Other poems involved political themes. All of her work was noticeably less playful and joyous than her earlier output.\n\nAfter Heneage Finch was released and his case dismissed, his nephew Charles Finch, the fourth Earl of Winchelsea, invited the couple to permanently move into the family's Eastwell Park, Kent, estate. The Finches took up residence in late 1690 and found peace and security on the beautiful estate, where they would live for more than 25 years in the quiet countryside.\n\nFor Anne Finch, the estate provided a fertile and supportive environment for her literary efforts. Charles Finch was a patron of the arts and, along with Heneage Finch, he encouraged Anne's writing. Her husband's support was practical. He began collecting a portfolio of her 56 poems, writing them out by hand and making corrective changes. One significant change involved Anne's pen name, which Heneage changed from \"Areta\" to \"Ardelia\".\n\nThe peace and seclusion at Eastwell fostered the development of Finch's poetry, and the retirement in the country provided her with her most productive writing period. Her work revealed her growing knowledge of contemporary poetic conventions, and the themes she addressed included metaphysics, the beauty of nature (as expressed in \"A Nocturnal Reverie\"), and the value of friendship (as in \"The Petition for an Absolute Retreat\").\n\nBy the early 18th century, the political climate in England had generally improved for the Finches. King William died in 1702, and his death was followed by the succession to the throne of Queen Anne, the daughter of James II, who had died in 1701. With these developments, the Finches felt ready to embrace a more public lifestyle. Heneage Finch ran for a parliamentary seat three times (in 1701, 1705, and 1710), but was never elected. Still, the Finches felt the time was right to leave the seclusion of the country life and move into a house in London.\n\nIn London, Anne Finch was encouraged to publish her poetry under her own name. Earlier, in 1691, she had anonymously published some of her poetry. In 1701 she published \"The Spleen\" anonymously. This well-received reflection on depression would prove to be the most popular of her poems in her lifetime. When the Finches returned to London, Anne acquired some important and influential friends, including renowned writers such as Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, who encouraged her to write and publish much more openly.\n\nShe was reluctant, as she felt the current social and political climate remained oppressive as far as women were concerned. (In her poem \"The Introduction,\" which was privately circulated, she reflected on contemporary attitudes toward female poets.) When she published \"Miscellany Poems, on Several Occasions\" in 1713, the cover page of the first printing indicated that the collected works (which included 86 poems as well as a play) were \"Written by a Lady.\" However, on subsequent printings, Finch (as Anne, Countess of Winchilsea) received credit as the author.\n\nOn 4 August 1712, Charles Finch, 4th Earl of Winchilsea, died childless. This made Anne's husband, his uncle, the 5th Earl of Winchilsea, and Anne, the Countess of Winchilsea.\n\nAnne Finch became Countess of Winchilsea upon the sudden and unexpected death of Charles Finch on 4 August 1712. As Charles Finch had no children, his uncle Heneage Finch (died 1726) became the Earl of Winchilsea, making Anne the Countess. However, the titles came with a cost. The Finches had to assume Charles Finch's financial and legal burdens. The issues were eventually settled in the Finches' favour in 1720, but not before the couple had endured nearly seven years of emotional strain.\n\nDuring this period, Heneage and Anne Finch faced renewed strains resulting from court politics. When Queen Anne died in 1714, she was succeeded by George I. Subsequently, a Whig government, which was hostile to the Jacobite cause, rose to power. The Jacobite rebellion, which took place in Scotland in 1715, further aggravated the tense political situation. The Finches became greatly concerned about their safety, especially after a friend, Matthew Prior, who shared their political sympathies, was sent to prison.\n\nAll of her worries combined started to take a toll on Anne Finch's health, which began to seriously deteriorate. For years she had been vulnerable to depression, and in 1715 she became seriously ill. Her later poems reflected her turmoil. In particular, \"A Suplication for the joys of Heaven\" and \"A Contemplation\" expressed her concerns about her life and political and spiritual beliefs.\n\nShe died in Westminster, London, and her body was returned to Eastwell for burial, according to her previously stated wishes. Her husband produced an obituary that praised her talents as a writer and her virtues as an individual. A portion of it read, \"To draw her Ladyship's just Character, requires a masterly Pen like her own (She being a fine Writer, and an excellent Poet); we shall only presume to say, she was the most faithful Servant to her Royall Mistresse, the best Wife to her Noble Lord, and in every other Relation, publick and private, so illustrious an Example of such extraordinary Endowments, both of Body and Mind, that the Court of England never bred a more accomplished Lady, nor the Church of England a better Christian.\"\n\nThe only major collection of Anne Finch's writings that appeared in her lifetime was \"Miscellany Poems, on Several Occasions\". Nearly a century after her death her poetic output had been largely forgotten, until the great English poet William Wordsworth praised her nature poetry in an essay included in his 1815 volume \"Lyrical Ballads\".\n\nA major collection titled \"The Poems of Anne, Countess of Winchilsea\", edited by Myra Reynolds, was published in 1903. For many years, it was considered the definitive collection of her writings. It remains the only scholarly collection of Finch's poetry, and includes all of the poems from Miscellany Poems and poems retrieved from manuscripts. Further, Reynolds's impressive introduction did as much to re-establish Finch's reputation as Wordsworth's previous praise.\n\nLater, The Wellesley Manuscript, which contained 53 unpublished poems, was released. Literary scholars have noted Finch's distinctive voice and her poems' intimacy, sincerity, and spirituality. They also expressed appreciation for her experimentation as well as her assured usage of Augustan diction and forms.\n\nAccording to James Winn (The Review of English Studies, lix, 2008, pp 67–85), Anne Finch is the librettist of \"Venus and Adonis\", with music by John Blow; the work is considered by some scholars to be the first true opera in the English language. In his critical edition of the opera for the Purcell Society, Bruce Wood agrees with Winn.\n\nIn 1929, in her classic essay \"A Room of One's Own\", Virginia Woolf both critiques Finch's writing and expresses great admiration for it. In Woolf's examination of the \"female voice\" and her search for the history of female writers, she argues that Finch's writing is \"harassed and distracted with hates and grievances,\" pointing out that to Finch \"men are hated and feared, because they have the power to bar her way to what she wants to do—which is to write.\" However, Woolf excuses the flaws she perceives in Finch's work by claiming that Finch surely had to \"encourage herself to write by supposing that what she writes will never be published.\" She goes on to acknowledge that in Finch's work, \"Now and again words issue of pure poetry…It was a thousand pities that the woman who could write like that, whose mind was turned to nature, and reflection, should have been forced to anger and bitterness.\" Woolf goes on in defence of her as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of women's writing. It is evident that Woolf sympathises deeply with Finch's plight as a female poet, and though she takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, she expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: \"…when one comes to seek out the facts about Lady Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her.\" Woolf wishes to know more about \"this melancholy lady, who loved wandering in the fields and thinking about unusual things and scorned, so rashly, so unwisely, 'the dull manage of a servile house.'\"\n\nAs a poet, Finch attained a modest amount of notoriety during her lifetime, which spanned the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In extension to her lyric poetry, odes, love poetry and prose poetry work, Finch's writing was considered to have fallen into the Augustan period (approximately 1660–1760). This is largely due to her work reflecting upon nature and finding both an emotional and religious relationship to it in her verse, consequentially commenting on the change in philosophical and political policy of the time. Later, literary critics recognized the diversity of her poetic output as well as its personal and intimate style. This style would earn greater attention after her death.\n\nIn her works, Finch drew upon her own observations and experiences, demonstrating an insightful awareness of the social mores and political climate of her era. But she also artfully recorded her private thoughts, which could be joyful or despairing, playful or despondent. The poems also revealed her highly developed spiritual side.\nWith these lines, written in the poem \"The Introduction\" by Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, readers are welcomed into a vibrant, emotional, and opinionated style. They are unapologetically let in on the distinctly female voice that is to come. Melancholy, full of wit, and socially conscious, Anne Finch wrote verse and dramatic literature with a talent that has caused her works to not only survive, but to flourish in an impressive poetic legacy throughout the centuries since her death.\n\nFinch's range as a writer was vast. She experimented with the poetic traditions of her day, often straying from the fold through her use of rhyme, meter and content, which ranged from the simplistic to the metaphysical. Additionally, Finch wrote several satiric vignettes modeled after the short tales of French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine. She mocked La Fontaine's fables, offering social criticism through biting sarcasm. Finch's more melancholy fare, however, gained her wider acclaim. Her famous poems in this sullen vein include \"A Nocturnal Reverie\" and \"Ardelia to Melancholy,\" both depicting severe depression. Finch also skillfully employed the Pindaric ode, exploring complex and irregular structures and rhyme schemes. Her most famous example of this technique is in \"The Spleen\" (1709), a poetic expression of depression and its effects:\n\nThis poem was first published anonymously, though it went on to become one of her most renowned pieces. Virginia Woolf said of Finch, \"a thousand pities that [her mind] should have been forced to [such] anger and bitterness\" \n\nDespite her occasionally overtly melancholy outlook, as many prominent friends of hers pointed out, Anne Finch was a competent, effective writer and is known today as one of the most versatile and gifted poets of her generation.\n\nOne of her poems was set to music by Purcell.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2325479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325479", "title": "Giuseppe Crespi", "text": "Giuseppe Crespi\n\nGiuseppe Maria Crespi (March 14, 1665 – July 16, 1747), nicknamed Lo Spagnuolo (\"The Spaniard\"), was an Italian late Baroque painter of the Bolognese School. His eclectic output includes religious paintings and portraits, but he is now most famous for his genre paintings.\n\nGiuseppe Crespi, together with Giambattista Pittoni, Giovan Battista Tiepolo, Giovan Battista Piazzetta, Canaletto and Francesco Guardi forms the traditional great Old Masters painters of that period.\n\nCrespi was born in Bologna to Girolamo Crespi and Isabella Cospi. His mother was a distant relation of the noble Cospi family, which had ties to the Florentine House of Medici. He was nicknamed \"the Spanish One\" (Lo Spagnuolo) because of his habit of wearing tight clothes characteristic of Spanish fashion of the time.\n\nBy age 12 years, he apprenticed with Angelo Michele Toni (1640–1708). From the age of 15–18 years, he worked under the Bolognese Domenico Maria Canuti. The Roman painter Carlo Maratti, on a visit to Bologna, is said to have invited Crespi to work in Rome, but Crespi declined. Maratti's friend, the Bolognese Carlo Cignani invited Crespi in 1681–82 to join an \"Accademia del Nudo\" for the purpose of studying drawing, and he remained in that studio until 1686, when Cignani relocated to Forlì and his studio was taken over by Canuti's most prominent pupil, Giovanni Antonio Burrini. From this time hence, Crespi worked independently of other artists.\n\nHis main biographer, Giampietro Zanotti, said of Crespi: \"(He) never again wanted for money, and he would make the stories and caprices that came into his imagination. Very often also he painted common things, representing the lowest occupations, and people who, born poor, must sustain themselves in serving the requirements of wealthy citizens\". Thus it was for Crespi himself, as he began a career servicing wealthy patrons with artwork. He is said to have had a \"camera optica\" in his house for painting. By the 1690s he had completed various altarpieces, including a \"Temptation of Saint Anthony\" commissioned by Count Carlo Cesare Malvasia, now in San Niccolò degli Albari.\n\nHe journeyed to Venice, but surprisingly, never to Rome. Bearing his large religious canvas of \"Massacre of the Innocents\" and a note from Count Vincenzo Rannuzi Cospi as an introduction, Crespi fled in the middle of the night to Florence in 1708, and gained the patronage of the Grand Duke Ferdinand I de' Medici. He had been forced to flee Bologna with the canvas, which while intended for the Duke, had been fancied by a local priest, Don Carlo Silva for himself. The events surrounding this episode became the source of much litigation, in which Crespi, at least for the next five years, found the Duke a firm protector.\n\nAn eclectic artist, Crespi was a portrait painter and a brilliant caricaturist, and was also known for his etchings after Rembrandt and Salvator Rosa. He could be said to have painted a number of masterpieces in different styles. He painted few frescoes, in part because he refused to paint for quadraturists, though in all likelihood, his style would not have matched the requirements of a medium then often used for grandiloquent scenography. He was not universally appreciated, Lanzi quotes Mengs as lamenting that the Bolognese school should close with the \"capricious\" Crespi. Lanzi himself describes Crespi as allowing his \"turn for novelty at length to lead his fine genius astray\". He found Crespi included caricature in even scriptural or heroic subjects, he cramped his figures, he \"fell in to mannerism\", and painted with few colors and few brushstrokes, \"employed indeed with judgement but too superficial and without strength of body\".\n\nOne celebrated series of canvases, the \"Seven Sacraments\", was painted around 1712, and now hangs in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden. It was originally completed for Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in Rome, and upon his death passed to the Elector of Saxony. These imposing works are painted with a loose brushstroke, but still maintain a sober piety. Making no use of hieratic symbols such as saints and putti, they utilize commonplace folk to illustrate sacramental activity.\n\nCrespi is best known today as one of the main proponents of baroque genre painting in Italy. Italians, until the 17th century, had paid little attention to such themes, concentrating mainly on grander images from religion, mythology, and history, as well as portraiture of the mighty. In this they differed from Northern Europeans, specifically Dutch painters, who had a strong tradition in the depiction of everyday activities. There were exceptions: the Bolognese Baroque titan of fresco, Annibale Carracci, had painted pastoral landscapes, and depictions of homely tradespeople such as butchers. Before him, Bartolomeo Passerotti and the Cremonese Vincenzo Campi had dallied in genre subjects. In this tradition, Crespi also followed the precedents set forth by the Bamboccianti, mainly Dutch genre painters active in Rome. Subsequently, this tradition would also be upheld by Piazzetta, Pietro Longhi, Giacomo Ceruti and Giandomenico Tiepolo to name a few.\n\nHe painted many kitchen scenes and other domestic subjects. The painting of \"The Flea\" (1709–10) depicts a young woman readying for sleep and supposedly grooming for a nagging pest on her person. The environs are squalid—nearby are a vase with a few flowers and a cheap bead necklace dangling on the wall—but she is sheltered in a tender womb of light. She is not a Botticellian beauty, but a mortal, her lapdog asleep on the bed-sheets.\n\nIn another genre scene, Crespi captures the anger of a woman at a man publicly urinating on wall, with a picaresque cat also objecting to the man's indiscretion.\n\nTrue to his eclecticism, is the naturalistic \"St John Nepomuk confessing the Queen of Swabia\", made late in Crespi's life. In this painting, much is said by partially shielded faces. His \"Resurrection of Christ\" is a dramatic arrangement in dynamic perspectives, somewhat influenced by Annibale Carracci's altarpiece of the same subject.\n\nWhile many came to work in the studio, Crespi established after Cignani's departure, few became notable. Antonio Gionima was moderately successful. Others included Giovanni Francesco Braccioli; Giacomo Pavia; Giovanni Morini; Pier Guariente; Felice and his brother Jacopo Giusti and Cristoforo Terzi. He may also have influenced Giovanni Domenico Ferretti. While the Venetian Giovanni Battista Piazzetta claimed to have studied under Crespi, the documentation for this is nonexistent.\n\nTwo of Crespi's sons, Antonio (1712–1781) and Luigi (1708–1779) became painters. According to their account, Crespi may have used a camera obscura to aid in depiction of outdoor scenes in his later years. After his wife's death, he became reclusive, rarely leaving the house except to go to daily mass.\n\n\n"}

Desiderative forms are often verbs, derived from a more basic verb through a process of morphological derivation. \n\nIn Sanskrit, the desiderative is formed through the suffixing of /sa/ and the prefixing of a reduplicative syllable, consisting of the first consonant of the root (sometimes modified) and a vowel, usually /i/ but /u/ if the root has an /u/ in it. Changes to the root vowel sometimes happen, as well. The acute accent, which indicates high pitch in Vedic, is usually placed at the first vowel.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Meadow Mari, the desiderative mood is marked by the suffix -не \"-ne\".\n\nIn Japanese, the desiderative takes two main forms: -\"tai\" (-たい) and \"-tagaru\" (-たがる). Both forms conjugate for tense and positivity, but in different ways: with the \"-tai\" ending, the verb becomes an \"-i adjective\", or a conjugable adjective, while the ending \"-tagaru\" creates a godan/yodan verb. Though there are other, compound forms to demonstrate wanting, these two alone are demonstrated because they are inflections of the main verb. These two forms are plain/informal in nature, and can be elevated to the normal-polite and other levels through normal methods.\n\n\"-tai\" is an absolute statement of desire, whereas \"-tagaru\" indicates the \"appearance\" of desire. Generally, one does not say things such as 太郎さんが食べたい \"Tarō wants to eat\" because one cannot read Tarō's thoughts; instead, one says 太郎さんが食べたがる \"it appears that Tarō wants to eat\".\n\nProto-Indo-European likely had a desiderative. In some daughter languages like Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic and possibly Celtic, it acquired the meaning of a future tense.\n"}
{"id": "2325524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325524", "title": "Giovanni Matteo Mario", "text": "Giovanni Matteo Mario\n\nGiovanni Matteo De Candia, also known as Mario (17 October 1810 – 11 December 1883), was an Italian opera singer. The most celebrated tenor of his era, he was lionized by audiences in Paris and London. He was the partner of the opera singer Giulia Grisi.\n\nMario was born in Cagliari, Sardinia on 17 October 1810 as Giovanni Matteo de Candia; his inherited titles were \"Cavaliere\" (Knight), \"Nobile\" (Nobleman) and \"Don\" (Sir) in the Kingdom of Sardinia and subsequently the Kingdom of Italy.\nHis aristocratic family belonged to the Savoyard-Sardinian nobility and social elite, part of the Kingdom of Sardinia ruled by the House of Savoy. His relatives and parents were members of the Royal Court of Turin, while his father don Stefano, marquis de Candia, held the ranks of military general, Royal Governor General of Nice under the Kingdom of Sardinia, and was aide-de-camp to King Charles Felix of Sardinia (house of Savoy).\n\nIn order to free himself from the burdensome ancestral traditions which he had inherited, and to mitigate his father's opposition to a member of the high-born De Candia family pursuing a 'lowly' musical career, the budding singer adopted the one-word stage name of \"Mario\" when he made his debut on 30 November 1838. Sometimes, however, he is referred to in print by the fuller appellation of \"Giovanni Mario\", and he is also called \"Mario de Candia\".\n\nMario's decision to become a professional singer arose accidentally. He was 12 years old when he moved from Cagliari to Turin, where he studied at the Royal Military Academy. Among his fellow students at the academy was the future Prime Minister of Italy, Camillo Cavour. While serving as a second-lieutenant in the King of Sardinia's Royal Guards in Turin, he became interested in politics and held meetings to debate the unification of the Italian Peninsula. He spent his own money to support this unpopular political movement, and he found himself in financial trouble. His father, who opposed his youngest son's political view, refused to support or help Mario. On 24 November 1836, Mario was expelled from the army and escaped by sea with his comrades to the French coast.\n\nAfter fleeing Piedmont, he landed with his comrades at a fishermen's town on the French coast near Nice. He stayed there at the cottage of an English fisherman named Captain Davis, a friend of Lord Byron's, for a few weeks. Then, disguised as a French fisherman, he travelled to San Lorenzo al Mare to meet one of his brothers-in-law, Lieutenant Roych. Roych had arranged for Mario to have a secret meeting with his mother, the Marquess of Candia. The Marquess provided Mario with gold coins and clothing sufficient for him to escape to the French capital. He expected to return after a few months to reengage his studies at the military academy in Turin as expected by his father.\n\nSoon after, the young nobleman travelled as a fugitive disguised as a comedian. Once in Paris, he was hosted at \"\"l'hôtel particulier\"\" of the Prince and Princess of Belgiojoso. Because they were also Italians exiled in Paris, they showed count Giovanni M. de Candia kindness and hospitality and were instrumental in the initial stages of his singing career. It is recorded that at the princess's parties, Giovanni Mario began to entertain with his singing while meeting many celebrities of the time such as Lady Blessington, George Sand, Alfred de Musset, Balzac, Alessandro Manzoni, Heinrich Heine, among others.\n\nSoon, Mario was made to feel welcome in Parisian salons and in the city's radical milieu. He was especially welcomed at the salon events of Princess Cristina Belgiojoso, where he was appreciated as an amateur tenor. For a time he earned his living by giving fencing and horseriding lessons. Eventually, the Marquis of Brême, who was from a noble Piedmontese family and was one of his father's old friends, became one of Mario's most helpful financial supporters. The marquis also served as mentor to Mario while he transitioned to his musical career.\n\nWhile exiled in Paris, he was widely known for his exceptionally fine natural voice. Mario was encouraged by the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer to become a singer. He took singing lessons from two teachers, a Frenchman named Ponchard and the former Italian tenor Marco Bordogni. Mario proved so gifted that he was swiftly offered an engagement with the Opéra.\n\nCoincidentally, the young tenor traveled to London by invitation of the Duke of Wellington, an acquaintance and frequent visitor at Mario's family home in Nice. \nDuring that trip, he sang in fashionable quartets at Bridgewater House with the British gentleman B. Mitford, father of Berty Mitford, Lord Redesdale. \nThe young tenor made his opera debut there on 30 November 1838 as the hero of Meyerbeer's \"Robert le diable\". Meyerbeer had provided a new recitative and aria for him in the second act (the \"Mario-Aria\"). Mario's performance generated great excitement, and \"a new star was born\".\n\nDespite achieving immediate success, he chose not to stay long at the Paris Opéra. With the splendid quality of his singing and his dashing stage presence, he hoped to perform in other places. In 1839, he first sang in London, achieving instant success in Donizetti's \"Lucrezia Borgia\". There he met the famous Italian soprano Giulia Grisi. Then he joined the Théâtre Italien, where Grisi and such illustrious singers as Maria Malibran, Henriette Sontag, Fanny Tacchinardi Persiani, Giovanni Battista Rubini, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache regularly performed. His first appearance there was as \"Nemorino\" in Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore\". \nFrom 1841 Mario and Grisi lived together. The acclaim that Mario received in Italian opera surpassed the renown that he had won in French opera, and he soon acquired a Europe-wide reputation for the beauty of his singing and the elegance of his bearing. He possessed a handsome face and a lithe figure; he liked to show off his legs in tights. His lyrical voice, though less dazzling than that of the older virtuoso tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini and not as powerful as that of his younger rival Enrico Tamberlik, was described as having grace and a beguiling, velvety softness that made it unique. The music critic and playwright George Bernard Shaw, who was born in 1856 and therefore could not have heard Mario in his prime, remarked that Mario's singing featured a marked vibrato.\n\nMario created few operatic parts, the most notable being that of Ernesto in Donizetti's \"Don Pasquale\" (1843). However, he sang in the première of Rossini's \"Stabat Mater\", and Verdi wrote a new cabaletta for him to sing in the main tenor aria in \"I due Foscari\" for a production in Paris. In established roles, Mario's greatest performances were as the title character in Rossini's \"Otello\", Gennaro in \"Lucrezia Borgia\", Almaviva in \"Il Barbiere di Siviglia\", Fernando in \"La favorite\", the Duke in \"Rigoletto\", Alfredo in \"La traviata\", Manrico in \"Il trovatore\", Lionel in \"Martha\" and many others. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London and the Théâtre Italien in Paris were the scenes of most of his stage triumphs. He sang in London from 1847 until 1867, and again during 1871.\n\nMario also made occasional appearances elsewhere in England in oratorio, for example at the Birmingham Festival of 1849 and at the Hereford Festival of 1855. He also undertook a string of concert tours around the United Kingdom. In about the year 1849, he acquired the \"Villa Salviati\" in Florence. At his salon, he received many distinguished cultural figures and members of the European nobility.\n\nIn 1854, he toured America with Giulia Grisi, earning both money and adulation during their trans-Atlantic jaunt. Mario could not marry Grisi because she was already married to Gérard de Melcy. Although Grisi and de Melcy were separated, divorce was not permitted by the Catholic Church in Italy neither in France, eventually, she married Mario in London England. Before meeting Mario, Grisi had had a son by Lord Frederick Stewart, a nephew of the famous Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh. The child was acknowledged by Castlereagh with the name Frederick Ormsby. He was later recognized as an adoptive son through his mother's marriage to Mario; he was known as Frederick Ormsby de Candia, socially styled as Fredo de Candia.\nMario and Grisi had six daughters (three died as children):\n\nIn 1869, Mario and Grisi were traveling from Paris to Saint Petersburg, for Mario to perform at the Italian Opera House at the Mariinsky Theater. Grisi died during their mid-trip stop in Berlin, but Mario went on to sing for the Tsar at the St. Petersburg theatre. Following their mother's death, his daughters were put under the care of tutors appointed by their godmother, the Grand Duchess Maria of Russia and president of the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.\n\nMario bade farewell to the stage at Covent Garden in 1871, but his last performances were concerts in a US tour with Carlotta Patti in 1872-73.\n\nHe spent his last years in Rome, where he was a friend of Prince Odescalchi. Financial difficulties beset him at times, due to his habitual extravagance. It is said that he used to smoke cigars habitually, even when taking a bath. He continued to entertain the rich and famous at social gatherings. He was a frequent guest at the Quirinal Palace where he could be found casually singing with Queen Margherita of Italy, herself an artist and a great lover of music. After Mario's death, his legacy was kept alive by a fund for opera singing education in his honor and name.\n\nA benefit concert was staged for Mario in London in 1878, and collections reached £4,000, which provided a pension for the singer. He died in Rome in 1883 and was buried in his home town, Cagliari, in 1884.\n\nDuring his singing career, Mario and Grisi both accumulated a significant fortune, particularly at their assignments at the Mariinsky Theatre where the Tsar used to pay them in gold coins. During their extensive tours in France and England they were paid handsomely in the currency of the time. They had also accumulated a great deal of jewelry—diamonds and other precious stones—as gifts from admiring kings and queens of Europe. Their joint fortune was estimated to be over 600 gold-bars, equivalent to 12 million US dollars in today's currency. They owned a home near L'Opéra in Paris, a mansion in Fulham, London, and the Villa Salviatino near Florence, as well as a cottage for Mario's mother in Cagliari. Mario's finances were entrusted to the Rothschild & Cie Banque in Paris, France, and eventually transferred to N M Rothschild & Sons in London, England.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of his life, he had spent most of the funds in his daughters' dowries, and he had used the remaining funds to partially self-finance his last tour of the Americas. Nevertheless, he maintained a large art collection that he had accumulated together with Grisi. He put these works up in an estate sale in London before he relocated to Italy. Most of his art collection and the other contents of the estate sale were acquired by the British family of the fiancé of his daughter Rita following her death. Most of the paintings he acquired with Grisi remain in the private collection of Sir John Aird, Bart.\n\nIn 1847 Mario bought a house in Sardinia, where his mother lived with his brother Carlo until he got married. The property is situated in Cagliari Old Town (Castello), in Contrada S. Caterina 1 (now via Canelles). After his death, the house passed down to his daughters. This house is now a part of a nuns' convent.\n\nThe main family house, called Palazzo de Candia, is nearby. It had been owned by his father don Stephano, Marquis of Candia. According to the rules of Sardinian nobility, the highest rank (nobiliary title) and main residence pass to the oldest male in line; thus, the Palazzo de Candia passed on to Mario's older brother. Eventually, that property became the home of his brother Carlo and family.\n\nIt is located at the bottom of Via dei Genovesi, where until the 16th century the Pisan town walls stood, between the Elephant and the Lion Towers. The façade was designed in the neoclassical style, possibly by the architect Gaetano Cima, or possibly by Mario's brother Carlo himself. Carlo had studied architecture in Turin together with Cima. On the first floor, there are halls with some frescoes and a terrace with scenic views of the gulf of Cagliari.\n\nNotes \nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

It is located primarily in Ravalli County, Montana (70.26% of the forest), but also has acreage in Idaho County, Idaho (29.24%), and Missoula County, Montana (0.49%).\n\nFounded in 1898, the forest is located in the Bitterroot and Sapphire Mountains with elevations ranging from 2,200 feet (650 m) along the Salmon River in Idaho to 10,157 foot (3,100 m) Trapper Peak. Roughly half the forest (743,000 acres, 3,000 km²) make up part or all of three distinct Wilderness areas. These areas include the Anaconda-Pintler, Selway-Bitterroot and Frank Church River of No Return Wildernesses. The distinction is that in wilderness areas, no roads, logging, mining or other construction is permitted and all access must be done either on foot or horseback; even bicycles are not permitted. Hunting, however is allowed forest-wide including wilderness areas.\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through parts of what are now forest lands in 1805. After the discovery of gold in Idaho and then Montana in the 1860s, numerous mining towns were built, some of which today are ghost towns. The Nez Perce National Historic Trail passes through a portion of the forest, following the route of the retreating Nez Perce on their historic path that led from Idaho to north central Montana in 1877. Heavy logging and other resource depletion beginning in the 1880s led conservationists to push for the preservation of the forest.\n\nThe Bitter Root Forest Reserve was established by the General Land Office on March 1, 1898 with . It was transferred to the U.S. Forest Service in 1906. On July 1, 1908 the name was changed to Bitterroot National Forest, with lands added from Big Hole National Forest and Hell Gate National Forest. Other lands were transferred from Bitterroot to Beaverhead, Clearwater, Nez Perce and Salmon National Forests. On October 29, 1934 part of Selway National Forest was added.\n\nIn August 2016, a wildfire burnt down fourteen houses.\n\nThe forest is home to many species of wildlife species including mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, gopher, a variety of chipmunks, beaver, porcupine, woodchuck, rabbits, a variety of squirrels, moose, black bear, and cougar in addition to many varieties of birds.\n\nThe forest is a combination of both grasslands and forested zones. Grazing rights are leased to private landowners in the lower altitudes where grasses and shrublands are dominant. Higher up, Douglas fir, larch, and lodgepole pine slowly give way to Engelmann Spruce and whitebark pine as the altitude increases. Above the treeline at 8,000 feet (2,400 m) the trees abruptly end and alpine flowers and grasses are found. A small grizzly bear population is located in the wilderness zones of the forest with black bear, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, elk and moose found all over this forest. An active effort to reintroduce the grizzly bear to the region concluded in 2000 with a plan to release 25 bears into the wilderness zones over a five-year period beginning in 2003.\n\nThere are 1,600 mi (2,500 km) of trails and 18 improved campgrounds within the forest. Outstanding fishing is found in the dozens of rivers and streams and lakes. The forest headquarters is located in Hamilton, Montana. There are local ranger district offices in Darby, Stevensville, and Sula. The largest nearby city is Missoula, Montana. The scenic Blodgett Canyon is but one of many steep canyons located in the forest. U.S. Highway \n93 passes through portions of the forest.\n\nThere are three officially designated wilderness areas in Bitterroot National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. All of them, however, lie mostly in neighboring National Forests (or in Bureau of Land Management land), as indicated.\n\nMuch of the forest outside of designated wilderness areas is still roadless and undeveloped. In addition to roadless acreage adjacent to designated wildernesses, a large roadless area 164,000 acres in size (as of 1992) and straddling the Montana-Idaho state line exists just west of Lost Trail Pass. This area, named for 9,154' Allan Mountain (in Idaho), lies mostly in Montana and is critical to the migration of wildlife between the wildlands of central Idaho and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The Allan Mountain area is a lower-elevation part of the Bitterroot Range that features extensive coniferous forests, steep canyons, and pockets of old-growth ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. Within the area is Overwhich Falls, a popular attraction; hiker's gentian (gentianopsis simplex) and primrose monkey flower (mimulus primuloides), sensitive plants, are found here in wet meadows. Elk, black bear, mountain goat, pine marten, and pileated woodpecker are residents.\n\n\n\n"}

This species is an annual or biennial plant of the family Asteraceae. This fairly typical thistle has red to purple flowers and shiny pale green leaves with white veins. Originally a native of Southern Europe through to Asia, it is now found throughout the world.\n\nMilk thistles can grow to be tall, and have an overall conical shape. The approximate maximum base diameter is . The stem is grooved and more or less cottony. The largest specimens have hollow stems.\n\nThe leaves are oblong to lanceolate. They are either lobate or pinnate, with spiny edges. They are hairless, shiny green, with milk-white veins.\n\nThe flower heads are 4 to 12 cm long and wide, of red-purple colour. They flower from June to August in the North or December to February in the Southern Hemisphere (summer through autumn).\n\nThe bracts are hairless, with triangular, spine-edged appendages, tipped with a stout yellow spine.\n\nThe achenes are black, with a simple long white pappus, surrounded by a yellow basal ring.\n\nPossibly native near the coast of southeast England, it has been widely introduced outside its natural range, for example into North America, Iran, Australia and New Zealand where it is considered an invasive weed. Cultivated fields for the production of raw material for the pharmaceutical industry exist on a larger scale in Austria (Waldviertel region), Germany, Hungary, Poland, China and Argentina. In Europe it is sown yearly in March–April. The harvest in two steps (cutting and threshing) takes place in August, about 2–3 weeks after the flowering.\n\nExkursionsflora Fuer Kreta by Jahn & Schoenfelder (1995, page 326) states that the distribution is mediterranean-near east. They quote it as a native plant of Crete, Greece.\n\nMilk thistle (\"Silybum marianum\") is a thorny plant presenting decorative leaves with a white pattern of veins and purple flower heads. The plant originates from mountains of the Mediterranean region, where it forms scrub on a rocky base.\n\nThe plant is sometimes also used as a decorative element in gardens, and its dried flower heads may be used for the decoration of dry bouquets.\n\nThe \"giant thistle of the Pampas\" reported by Darwin in the Voyage of the Beagle is thought by some to be \"Silybum marianum\".\n\nTraditional milk thistle extract is made from the seeds, which contain approximately 4–6% silymarin. The extract consists of about 65–80% silymarin (a flavonolignan complex) and 20–35% fatty acids, including linoleic acid. Silymarin is a complex mixture of polyphenolic molecules, including seven closely related flavonolignans (silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silychristin, isosilychristin, silydianin) and one flavonoid (taxifolin). Silibinin, a semipurified fraction of silymarin, is primarily a mixture of 2 diastereoisomers, silybin A and silybin B, in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n\nMilk thistle has been used for a number of purposes including treatment of liver disease, prevention and treatment of cancer, and supportive treatment of poisoning from death cap mushrooms; however, clinical study results were described as heterogeneous and contradictory. A 2007 Cochrane Review included eighteen randomized clinical trials which assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. It questioned the beneficial effects and highlighted the lack of high-quality evidence. The review concluded that more good-quality, randomized clinical trials are needed. Cancer Research UK say that milk thistle is promoted on the internet for its claimed ability to slow certain kinds of cancer, but that there is no good evidence in support of these claims. Milk thistle may appear to stimulate prolactin due to possibly estrogenic activity.\n\nMilk thistle based supplements have been measured to have the highest mycotoxin concentrations of up to 37 mg/kg when compared to various plant-based dietary supplements.\n\nMilk thistle has also been known to be used as food. The roots can be eaten raw or boiled and buttered or par-boiled and roasted. The young shoots in spring can be cut down to the root and boiled and buttered. The spiny bracts on the flower head were eaten in the past like globe artichoke, and the stems (after peeling) can be soaked overnight to remove bitterness and then stewed. The leaves can be trimmed of prickles and boiled as a spinach substitute or they can also be added raw to salads.\n\nBecause of potassium nitrate content, the plant has been found to be toxic to cattle and sheep. When potassium nitrate is eaten by ruminants, the bacteria in the animal's stomach breaks the chemical down, producing nitrite ions. Nitrite ions then combine with hemoglobin to produce methaemoglobin, blocking the transport of oxygen. The result is a form of oxygen deprivation.\n\n"}

Atkins (born August 1, 1962) is an American politician serving as the 51st and current President pro tempore of the California State Senate since 2018. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 69th Speaker of the California State Assembly from 2014 to 2016. She has represented the 39th State Senate district since 2016, encompassing most of San Diego.\n\nUpon her election as Speaker of the State Assembly, she became the third woman and first acknowledged lesbian to be elected to the position, as well as the first lawmaker from San Diego holding the office. She served on the San Diego City Council from 2000 to 2008, including a term as Acting Mayor of San Diego in 2005. She also served as Acting Governor of California for nine hours on July 30, 2014. In 2018, she succeeded Kevin de León as State Senate President pro tempore. This made her the first woman and the first openly LGBT person to lead the California State Senate.\n\nAtkins spent her early years in Max Meadows, Virginia, moving to Roanoke at the age of seven. Her father was a miner and her mother a seamstress; she grew up in a home with no running water. She graduated from Emory & Henry College in 1984 and earned a BA in political science, focusing on community organizing. She later attended the senior executive program from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Atkins relocated to San Diego in 1985.\n\nWhen she first came to San Diego, she joined the staff of Womancare Health Center as Director of Clinic Services. She then served for a number of years as council representative and policy analyst to City Councilmember Christine Kehoe. When Kehoe was elected to the state legislature, Atkins was elected to Kehoe's City Council seat on November 7, 2000. She was reelected in March 2004, without the need for a November runoff.\n\nIn April 2005 Mayor Dick Murphy resigned after criticism of his handing of the city's fiscal problems. Councilmember Michael Zucchet, who was deputy mayor, took over, but three days later, resigned along with Councilmember Ralph Inzunza after they were convicted of wire fraud and Hobbs Act violations. In an emergency vote on July 19, Atkins was chosen by the other five council members to take over as mayor pro-tem for one week. On July 25 they reaffirmed their choice and designated Atkins deputy mayor to serve until Jerry Sanders was sworn in as mayor on December 5. Atkins was the first openly lesbian mayor of San Diego.\n\nWhile on the council, she represented the City of San Diego at the San Diego Chapter of the League of Cities as well as on the board and executive committee of the Metropolitan Transit System. She sat on the San Diego Association of Governments (SanDAG) Regional Housing Working Group, as an alternate to the Transportation Committee and the Regional Planning Committee, and the City/County Joint Homeless Task Force. She continues to serve on the San Diego River Conservancy as an appointee of former California State Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson. She lists among her priorities affordable housing, workers' rights, neighborhood revitalization and redevelopment of San Diego's older urban neighborhoods.\n\nShe was elected to the State Assembly in November 2010, receiving 57.7% of the vote. She represented the 76th Assembly district. In November 2012 she ran in the 78th Assembly district due to redistricting, and won with 62% of the vote.\n\nIn 2012 she introduced AB 1522, a bill to prevent the granting of financial support and other spousal rights to abusive spouses. The bill was inspired by the case of a San Diego woman who was ordered to pay legal fees and spousal support to her ex-husband even though he was in prison for abusing her.\n\nIn 2012, she was the Majority Leader of the California State Assembly; in January 2014 she was chosen by the Democratic Caucus to take over as Speaker of the Assembly later in the year, replacing termed-out speaker John Pérez. She was the first Speaker of the Assembly from San Diego; the first lesbian to hold the position; and the third woman to do so. Atkins was reelected as Speaker by the Democratic caucus in November 2014. As Speaker she helped to write and secure passage for a $7.5-billion water bond that was approved by the legislature and the voters in 2014. Atkins stepped down as Assembly speaker in March 2016.\n\nShe ran as candidate for the California's 39th State Senate district in 2016, initially challenging the incumbent Marty Block, also a Democrat, before Block bowed out. In the general election, she defeated Republican John Renison with 63% of the vote.\n\nIn 2018, Atkins succeeded Kevin de León as State Senate President pro tempore. This made her the first woman and the first openly LGBT person to lead the California State Senate.\n\nIn May 2019, after Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Anthony J. Portantino blocked Senate Bill 50, a bill proposing major reforms to address the California housing shortage by reducing local control (such as requiring the permitting of more apartment construction near public transit and in suburbs with high-paying jobs), from leaving committee and entering the Senate for debate and voting, Atkins refused to step in and take the bill out of committee, which was within her powers. Proponents of the bill accused Portantino of abusing his powers to deny SB50 a debate and a vote in the Senate. Atkins' action stopped legislators from bringing the bill back for consideration that year. Due to this delay, the bill could not be considered by the Senate until 2020.\n\nIn January 2020, when the bill was being reconsidered, Atkins exercised her parliamentary powers to move the bill out of Portantino's committee. The bill made it to the senate floor and was subsequently defeated after multiple floor votes.\n\nAtkins is one of eight members of the California Legislative LGBT Caucus. She lives in the South Park neighborhood with her spouse, Jennifer LeSar.\n\n"}

He has received sentences for attempted murder, assault, robbery, and dealing narcotics and has spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions in Sweden. Olofsson has been called Sweden's first \"pop-gangster\".\n\nOlofsson was present at the Norrmalmstorg robbery whose events resulted in the creation of the phrase \"Stockholm syndrome\" to describe them.\n\nOlofsson was born into a home where both parents were alcoholics. When he was eight years old, his mother became a single mother, taking care of Olofsson and his two younger sisters. Her problems led to the three children being placed in foster care. When his mother regained control of her life, and started working in a shop, the children were returned to her care and they moved to an apartment in Hisingen, Gothenburg.\n\nFor several petty crimes, sixteen-year-old Olofsson was placed in a behavioural institution for young offenders in 1963. Olofsson and two other boys escaped from the institution in August 1965 and entered the country estate of Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander at Harpsund, where they stole grapes, cucumbers and tomatoes from the greenhouse. They fled when the gardener discovered them. Three months later Olofsson assaulted two police officers in Eskilstuna. On 4February 1966, he was sentenced to three years in prison; this was his third sentence and his first real prison sentence. In late 1966, he made his first escape from the prison at Tidaholm.\n\nOn 29July 1966, police officers Ragnar Sandahl and Lennart Mathiasson responded to a burglary at a bicycle shop at Skjutsaregatan in Nyköping. Sandahl was shot and killed by Gunnar Norgren. The other burglar was Olofsson, who became a nationally known criminal. Norgren was arrested on 16August that year in an apartment at Utåkersgatan 4 in Gothenburg and later confessed to the murder. The apartment belonged to a boyfriend of Olofsson's sister. Olofsson had escaped from the apartment before police entered and managed to elude them for two weeks until he was captured on 25August. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for his role in the break-in, and Norgren was sentenced to twelve years.\n\nOn 4February 1969, Olofsson escaped from prison and fled to the Canary Islands. He was later arrested in an apartment in Frankfurt. On 5August, two months before he was to be released, he escaped again from an open institution in Bohuslän. In the early 1970s, Olofsson was imprisoned at the Kumla Prison. On 2February 1973, he was arrested in the dining room of the \"Kurhotel\" in Ulricehamn. Police had received a tip from a cleaning-lady who had seen a gun in his hotel room. At the time of his arrest he had been on the run for seven months and had robbed a bank in Gothenburg. In May 1973, he was sentenced to six years in prison and transported to the Kalmar Prison.\n\nIn late 1973, Olofsson was incarcerated at the Norrköping Prison when bankrobber Jan-Erik Olsson took hostages at Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm. Olsson demanded that Olofsson be allowed to come to the bank. Olofsson was brought to the bank, where he spent the next six days with the hostages. This event subsequently led to the creation of the phrase \"Stockholm syndrome.\" He escaped from the Norrköping prison on 20March 1975. In April that year he went into a bank in Copenhagen with a gun in each hand, fired a warning shot, and robbed the bank of SEK194,000.\n\nThe podcast \"Criminal\" spoke with Olofsson about the Norrmalmstorg robbery in their episode \"Hostage.\"\n"}
{"id": "2325557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325557", "title": "Caravan of Death", "text": "Caravan of Death\n\nThe Caravan of Death () was a Chilean Army death squad that, following the Chilean coup of 1973, flew by helicopters from south to north of Chile between September 30 and October 22, 1973. During this foray, members of the squad ordered or personally carried out the execution of at least 75 individuals held in Army custody in certain garrisons. According to the NGO \"Memoria y Justicia\", the squad killed 97 people: 26 in the South and 71 in the North. Augusto Pinochet was indicted in December 2002 in this case, but he died four years later without having been judged. His trial, however, is ongoing since his and other military personnel and a former military chaplain have also been indicted in this case.\n\nThe squad was made up of several Army officers. They were led by Army Brigadier General Sergio Arellano Stark, appointed by Augusto Pinochet \"Official Delegate of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and President of the Government Assembly.\" Other members included Arellano's second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Sergio Arredondo González, later director of the Infantry School of the Army; General Manuel Contreras, head of the National Intelligence Directorate (DINA); Major Pedro Espinoza Bravo, Contreas' second-in-command, an Army Intelligence officer and later operations chief of the DINA secret police; Captain Marcelo Moren Brito, later commander of Villa Grimaldi, the torture camp; Lieutenant Armando Fernández Larios, later a DINA operative and involved in the assassination of Orlando Letelier (Salvador Allende's former Minister) and others.\n\nThe group traveled from prison to prison in a Puma helicopter, inspecting military garrisons and then ordering — or carrying out themselves — the execution of the detainees. The victims were then buried in unmarked graves. General Joaquin Lagos explained why he didn't return the bodies of the 14 executed prisoners of Antofagasta to their families:\n\nThough the Rettig Commission puts the count of murdered individuals at approximately 3,000 during the 17-year Pinochet regime, the deaths of these 75 individuals and the Caravan of Death episode itself are highly traumatic, especially as many of the victims had voluntarily turned themselves in to the military authorities, were all in secured military custody and posed no immediate threat because they had no history of violence, nor were threatening to commit any such violence.\n\nAccording to Oleguer Benaventes Bustos, the second in command at the Talca Regiment when General Arellano landed there on September 30, 1973, the squad's aims were to instill \"terror\" in potential opponents as well as to ensure the loyalty to the new assembly of military staff outside the capital:\n\nBeside the summary executions of scores of opponents, General Arellano punished several military officers for not being \"harsh enough\" on prisoners, including the constitutionalist officer Lieutenant Colonel Efrain Jaña Giron in Talca and Army Major Fernando Reveco Valenzuela in Calama. Giron, in charge of Mountain Regiment N 16, was dismissed on September 30, 1973 for \"failure to fulfill military duties\" and replaced by his second in command, Olaguer Benaventes Bustos. He was then imprisoned two years in Santiago. Valenzuela, who presided over the first court martial of Calama, was forced to resign on October 2, 1973, as he was considered too lenient. Transported to Santiago, he was also judged guilty of \"failure to fulfill military duties\" and subsequently tortured at the Air Force War Academy in Talca and imprisoned for 15 months.\n\nOn October 19, 1973, General Joaquin Lagos, commander of the Army 1st Division and zone chief in State of Siege, designated as governor of the Province of Antofagasta after the coup, presented his resignation to Pinochet. The day before, the leader of the squad, Arellano, had arrived in his district and executed 56 persons behind Lagos' back. In some cases, prisoners were sliced with machetes before being shot. When General Lagos learnt of these murders, he requested a meeting with Pinochet and offered him his resignation. Years later, he explained that he did not return the corpses to the victims' families for burial because he was too \n\"ashamed\" of the barbarous slaughter of the men. According to the NGO \"Memoria y Justicia\", \"it is believed that Lagos’ denunciation brought a halt to the spiral of murders.\"\n\nIn 1993, Contreas and Espinoza were convicted for their participation in the Caravan of Death. Contreas received a seven year sentence and Espinoza received a six year sentence. Following failed attempts to overturn the convictions, Contreas and Espinoza began serving their sentences in 1995 at a prison outside Santiago specially constructed to house former military officials.\n\nIn June 1999, the magistrate Juan Guzmán Tapia, who had indicted Augusto Pinochet on his return from London, ordered the arrest of five retired military officers for their part in the Caravan of Death. Pinochet himself had been indicted by the Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón in 1998 after complaints presented by Victoria Saavedra and the \"Mujeres de Calama\" (Calama's Women), which included the Caravan of Death case investigated by Guzmán Tapia.\n\nOn 23 May 2000, the Court of Appeal of Santiago lifted his parliamentary immunity concerning this case and he was indicted by Guzmán Tapia, on 1 December 2000, as co-author of the crimes of aggravated abduction and first degree murder committed by the Caravan of Death against 75 persons. However, as soon as 11 December 2000, the procedure was suspended by the Court of Appeal of Santiago for medical reasons. In January 2001, the physicians stated that Pinochet was suffering from a \"light dementia\". On 8 March 2000, the Court of Appeal confirmed Pinochet's indictment in the Caravan of Death case, but only as an \"accomplice\" and not as its main instigator. However, the judiciary procedures were again suspended on 9 July 2001 because of alleged health reasons, and finally the Supreme Court invoked in 2002 a \"moderate dementia\" of Pinochet which enabled him not to be judged in this case.\n\nIn March 2006, judge Víctor Montiglio ordered the arrest of thirteen former army officers for their participation in the killings on murder charges.\n\nIn July 2006, the Supreme Court upheld a January 2006 judgment by the Court of Appeal of Santiago, which argued that the 2002 Supreme Court's ruling stating that Pinochet could not be prosecuted in the Caravan of Death case because it did not apply to two of its victims, former bodyguards of Allende. On 28 November 2006, Víctor Montiglio, charged of this case, ordered Pinochet's house arrest. Pinochet died on December 10, 2006, without having been judged in this case nor any other.\n\nIn August 2007, a Catholic priest, Luis Jorquera, then chaplain at a military detention center set up in Chile's north after September 11, 1973, was charged with involvement in the Caravan of Death. Witnesses alleged that he had been involved in the exhuming of the victims two years later, the corpses being then thrown into the sea from a plane. Jorquera, who is the first priest to be charged with crimes committed during Pinochet's dictatorship, denied these accusations. Beside him, the Court of Appeals in Antofagasta charged eleven other persons of involvement in the Caravan of Death, including Army Gen Miguel Trincado and Army Maj Armando Fernandez Larios. Eight jurors in 2003 found Armando Fernández Larios liable in a Caravan of Death case for the death of Winston Cabello and ordered him to pay $4 million to Cabello's relatives. The verdict was a victory for Winston Capello's sister, Zita Capello-Barrueto, who spent many years seeking truth and justice in her brother's case. Her book, \"In Search of Spring,\" documented her crusade for justice. \n\nArmando Fernández Larios, and his other two key players in the Letellier-Moffitt murders and other cases linked to atrocities in Chile — Virgilio Paz Romero and Michael Vernon Townley — are wanted in Chile for the detention, torture, and killing of Spanish-Chilean citizen Carmelo Soria on July 14, 1976.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a five-star rank, equivalent to the ranks in the other armed services of admiral of the fleet in the Royal Australian Navy, and Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force. The subordinate army rank is general.\n\nField Marshal Sir William Birdwood (later created The 1st Baron Birdwood) was a British Army officer who commanded the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in the First World War. As such, he was made a general in the AIF in 1917, and in the Australian Army in 1920. When he was promoted to the rank of field marshal in the British Army on 20 March 1925, Birdwood was also made an honorary field marshal in the Australian Military Forces. He held the rank until his death on 17 May 1951, and his baton is kept in the Australian War Memorial.\n\nKing George VI was appointed a field marshal in the Australian Army on 2 June 1938.\n\nSir Thomas Blamey was the first and is the only Australian-born field marshal of the Australian Army. He was promoted to the rank on the insistence of the then Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies. Blamey served in World War I in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), from the horrors of trench warfare at the ANZAC positions at Gallipoli to duties as chief of staff to Lieutenant General Sir John Monash, Commander of the Australian Corps in France and Belgium. Blamey attained the rank of brigadier general by the war's end. During the inter-war years he served as chief commissioner of the Victoria Police. During the 1920s and 1930s he expressed public concern over the state of the Australian Military Forces due to financial restrictions brought about by the Great Depression.\n\nLater, during World War II he commanded the 2nd AIF. He was promoted to general in 1941 and became Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces and Commander of Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific Area under the overall command of United States General Douglas MacArthur. Blamey attended Japan's ceremonial surrender in Tokyo Bay on 3 September 1945 and signed the Instrument of Surrender on behalf of Australia. He later personally accepted the Japanese surrender at Morotai. In his address to the surrendering Japanese commander, Blamey declared: \"\"...in receiving your surrender, I do not recognise you as an honourable and gallant foe...\"\". This speech is also on display in the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.\n\nIt is a common but erroneous belief that the then British Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), Sir William Slim, himself a field marshal (and later Governor-General of Australia), resisted Menzies' recommendation for Blamey's promotion, on the grounds that Dominion generals could not be made field marshals. At the time the CIGS was the final authority in the then British Commonwealth for such promotions. The various statutes and declarations from the Balfour doctrine of 1926 meant that it was Australia's decision nor was Slim ever consulted on the matter. As early as the Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference 1926: “It is the right of the Government of each Dominion to advise the Crown on all matters relating to its own affairs. Consequently, it would not be in accordance with constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty's Government ... [on a Dominion matter] against the views of the Government of that Dominion\". Sir William Slim was not the arbiter of such promotions even in Britain as field marshal is a Royal appointment. The concerns came from the palace as there was a concern that other retired officers might lobby for a field marshal's baton. Menzies wanted the King to sign off on the promotion so that Blamey would count not just as an Australian field marshal but a British one too. Canberra thought that the opposition was based on Blamey's dominion status and Menzies pointed out that Field Marshal Jan Smuts was a Dominion general. Sir Alan Lascelles countered by saying (untruthfully) that Blamey was a retired officer, and retired officers could not be promoted to field marshal. Menzies got around this restriction by recalling Blamey from retirement. Blamey was, at the time of his promotion, seriously ill and mostly bed-ridden in the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. He was promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950, and was presented with his field marshal's baton at a ceremony held in the hospital's sun room by the then Governor-General, William McKell. Blamey died after a long illness on 27 May 1951.\n\nBlamey's field marshal's baton is on display in the Second World War galleries at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It is about 40 centimetres (16 inches) long and at its top has a golden mount with two rings of roses, thistles and shamrocks surmounted by a miniature figure of Saint George mounted on his horse and battling a dragon with his lance. The miniature is about 8 centimetres (3 inches) high. The shaft of the baton is covered in scarlet velvet inlaid with a succession of golden lions passant along its length and around its circumference. The pommel (bottom end) of the baton is ornate solid gold with the details of the presentation to Blamey engraved on the base. It is identical to those of all field marshals of the United Kingdom since Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington in 1813, all of which have been made by the same firm, R. & S. Garrard & Co, Crown Jewellers, of London. The design is based upon that of the Marshal of France, the baton of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan captured by Wellington at Battle of Vitoria being used as a model. Blamey also appears in the list of field marshals of the British Army.\n\nCurrently, the only living Australian field marshal is HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who was promoted to the rank of field marshal in the Australian Army on 1 April 1954—over a year after he attained that rank in the British Army on 15 January 1953. However, as consort of Queen Elizabeth II, Philip's rank is purely ceremonial—he has no command or control role in the Australian Defence Force (ADF), and is not part of the ADF's operational structure.\n\nHe first paraded in Australia in field marshal's uniform, complete with baton, in Canberra on 17 February 1954 when he and the Queen attended a meeting of 4,000 Australian ex-servicemen in front of (Old) Parliament House. At the base of the memorial statue of King George V, the royal couple were greeted by presidents of ex-service organisations, after which they talked to 100 disabled men and proceeded to slowly drive through the ranks. Later the same day, the prince wore the uniform when he attended the presentation of new colours ceremony at the Royal Military College Duntroon, conducted by the Queen. During the proceedings, described in contemporary accounts as \"poignant\" and \"spectacular\", the new colours replaced those presented to the Royal Military College on the same parade ground by her late father King George VI in 1927 (then the Duke of York).\n\nOnly the Governor-General of Australia, as Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Defence Force, and by convention on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Australia, can appoint officers to the rank of field marshal. The badge of rank is St. Edward's Crown mounted above two crossed batons that are circled by a wreath of oak leaves.\n\nAfter the Duke of Edinburgh, currently the most senior rank held in the Australian Army is General, which is held by the Chief of Defence (when filled by an Army Officer). The most senior appointment within the nominal Army organisation (excluding Chief of Defence) is the Chief of Army at the rank of Lieutenant General. Other three-star positions potentially available to Australian Army Officers are Vice Chief of the Defence Force (VCDF) and Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS).\n\n\n"}

The base is named after local World War II hero and Medal of Honor recipient, Lieutenant Colonel Leon Robert Vance Jr.\n\nThe host unit at Vance is the 71st Flying Training Wing (71 FTW), which is a part of Air Education and Training Command (AETC). The commander of the 71 FTW is Colonel Corey A. Simmons. The vice-commander is Colonel Lee G. Gentile, Jr. and the command chief is Chief Master Sergeant Jeffrey Wilson.\n\nConstruction began on 12 July 1941 for a cost of $4,034,583. Army Air Corps Project Officer, Major Henry W. Dorr supervised the construction and developed the basic pilot training base. In 1941, for the sum of $1 a year, this land was leased from the city of Enid to the federal government as a site for a pilot training field, and on November 21 the base was officially activated. The installation was without a name but was generally referred to as Air Corps Basic Flying School. The mission of the school was to train aviation cadets to become aircraft pilots and commissioned officers in the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nThe facility was assigned to the AAF Gulf Coast Training Center, with the Army Air Force Pilot School (Primary) activated (phase 1 pilot training), in which flight cadets were taught basic flight using two-seater training aircraft. Fairchild PT-19s were the primary trainer used.\n\nIt was not until 1942, that the base was officially named Enid Army Flying School, also known as Woodring Field. It was officially activated on 11 February 1942. On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 31st Flying Training Wing (Primary) at Enid and assigned it to the AAF Central Flying Training Command. For the duration of the war, the basic phase of training graduated 8,169 students, while the advanced phase of training graduated 826.\n\nAs the demand for pilots decreased with the end of the war in Europe, the Enid Army Flying Field was deactivated on 2 July 1945 and was transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers on 2 July 1946.\n\nThe base was reactivated on January 13, 1948, and its name changed to Enid Air Force Base, as one of the pilot training bases within the Air Training Command (ATC). Its mission was to provide training for advanced students in multi-engine aircraft.\n\nIn keeping with the Air Force tradition of naming bases for deceased Air Force flyers, on July 9, 1949, the base was renamed after a local World War II hero and Medal of Honor recipient, Lieutenant Colonel Leon Robert Vance, Jr.\n\nThe first aircraft flown at Vance was the BT-13A, followed shortly by the BT-15. In 1944, advanced students flew the TB-25 and TB-26. Following the establishment of U.S. Air Force as a separate service in September 1947, Vance began training in the AT-6 and eventually the T-33 Shooting Star. The T-37 Tweet flew at Vance beginning in 1961, and the T-38 Talon in 1963 as the Air Force transitioned to its Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) system.\n\nIn 1995 Air Force officials announced that Vance would transition to the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training curriculum. Under SUPT, Vance students begin their training in the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II,\nfollowed by the T-1A Jayhawk for students identified for jet tanker, transport or large reconnaissance aircraft, and the T-38 Talon for fighter, bomber and other USAF fixed-wing aircraft. With the introduction of the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) to Vance in 2005, the 71 FTW began transitioning from the T-37 to the newer T-6 Texan II. Joint training with the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps began at Vance in 1996, with select USN and USMC strike jet student naval aviators obtaining all training at Vance in the T-37 and T-38 except for carrier qualification, which they subsequently complete in the T-45 Goshawk at NAS Meridian, Mississippi or NAS Kingsville, Texas. A number of senior naval aviators in the rank of commander have also served as flying training squadron (FTS) commanders in the 71 FTW. Today, Student Naval Aviators only undergo primary T-6 training at Vance, transitioning to USN/USMC Strike jet pipeline, the USN/USMC/USCG multi-engine maritime pipeline, or the USN/USMC/USCG rotary-wing and tilt-rotor pipeline at respective naval air stations in Florida, Texas or Mississippi.\n\nAll students practice basic patterns and landings at Kegelman Air Force Auxiliary Field located near Cherokee, Oklahoma. Vance is considered the second busiest RAPCON facility in the United States, behind Nellis AFB. Nellis AFB is open 24 hours, but Vance AFB has more traffic per hour.\n\n\n\nThe 71st Flying Training Wing aims to train world-class pilots for the United States Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and its allies and to prepare Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) warriors to deploy in support of the combatant commanders.\n\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at Vance Air Force Base.\n\nUnits marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Vance, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.\n\nAir Education and Training Command (AETC)\n\n\nAir Force Reserve Command (AFRC)\n\n\n\n"}

He is a dual-code rugby international, having played rugby league for Australia and rugby union for Italy. A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian Kangaroos representative or , he played in the National Rugby League for Sydney club the Penrith Panthers (whom he captained to victory in the 2003 NRL Premiership). Gower then switched rugby union, playing for French Top 14 side Bayonne, and through grandparentage represented Italy. He returned to rugby league with the London Broncos in the Super League and then finished his playing career with one more National Rugby League season at the Newcastle Knights.\n\nGower was born in Penrith, New South Wales, Australia. He is of Italian descent.\n\nGower played his junior football for the Colyton Colts before being signed by the Penrith Panthers.\n\nIn Round 11 of the 1996 ARL season Gower made his ARL début for the Panthers against the Gold Coast Chargers. Gower made his representative début in his second season in first-grade when still aged only eighteen. He was selected in the Australian Super League side for the ANZAC Test against New Zealand in 1997. He appeared in both Super League Tests against New Zealand and made the end of year Super League tour to Great Britain, playing in all three Tests in England at halfback. Following the re-unification of Australian rugby league, Gower debuted for New South Wales in the 1999 State of Origin series. He was selected for the ANZAC Test that year but was dismissed following a disciplinary incident. However he was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at in the Kangaroos' 22–20 victory.\n\nIn 2000, Gower won the Hooker of the Year award at the 2000 Dally M Awards. In 2002, Gower debuted for the City Origin team in the annual City vs Country Origin clash. Between 2002 and 2005, Gower captained the Panthers, the highlight of which was the 2003 NRL Grand Final victory over the Sydney Roosters. After that Gower was selected to go on the 2003 Kangaroo tour. As 2003 NRL premiers, the Panthers travelled to England to face Super League VIII champions, the Bradford Bulls in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Gower captained the Panthers at half back in their 22–4 loss. Gower was named Australia's captain for the Test match against France on the 2005 Tri-Nations tour. Gower became the second Penrith Panthers player to captain his country, after Brad Fittler in 1995.\n\nIn 2006, Gower married Penrith Panthers cheerleader Amanda Flynn. In 2007, Gower's last year at the Panthers, he ended the season with 238 career matches for the Panthers, four games short of the club record of 242 held by Steve Carter.\n\nOn 26 June 2007, Gower switched codes by signing with French Top 14 rugby union side Bayonne, having two years still to run on his contract at the Panthers.\n\nIn 2008, Gower expressed his desire to play rugby union for Italy. He qualified for the 'Azzurri' due to his Italian grandfather. On 13 June 2009, Gower made his first appearance for Italy at fly-half against Australia after being selected for the mid-season tour of Australia and New Zealand. Italy coach Nick Mallett had initial reservations about selecting Gower.\n\nFollowing the expiry of his union contract, Gower returned to rugby league, signing a 2-year contract with the London Broncos of the Super League starting in 2012.\n\nAs a result, he did not feature in Italy's 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign, and was instead selected in the Italy rugby league squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup qualifying tournament, although he missed all three matches due to injury. On 14 November 2012, Gower extended his Broncos contract by a year, making him a Bronco until the end of 2014. He was then named captain, although he stood down as captain in May.\n\nIn June 2013, Gower gained a release from his Broncos contract to return to Australia and negotiate a contract with National Rugby League club the Newcastle Knights. On 8 June 2013, Gower signed a contract with the Knights for the remainder of the 2013 NRL season.\n\nGower was named in the Italy squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. However he did not play due to the injury he suffered at the end of the 2013 NRL season.\n\nAt the end of the 2013 NRL season, Gower announced his retirement due to injury.\n\nOn 25 June 2016, Gower was inducted into the Penrith Panthers hall of fame alongside Grahame Moran, Royce Simmons, and Greg Alexander.\n\nGower has been involved in a number of alcohol-related off-field incidents. In 1999, Gower exposed himself to a female Irish tourist in a Coogee bar, blaming his behavior on alcohol intoxication. He was dumped from the squad and fined A$2,500 by the NRL and a further A$500 in court after pleading guilty to indecent exposure.\n\nIn December 2005, Gower was fired as Panthers captain after incidents at a charity golf event where he argued with several guests, groped the then teenage daughter of former league player Wayne Pearce, chased Mitchell Pearce with a bottle before vomiting on him, streaked nude around the resort, stole and crashed a golf cart, held a butter knife to the throat of a Sydney radio personality before throwing it at resort guests, and engaged in a brawl with resort security before being ejected from the official function and detained by police. He was handed a \"final warning\" by the National Rugby League and fined A$100,000, with A$90,000 to be paid to an NRL programme encouraging the responsible use of alcohol by league players and $10,000 to replace the destroyed golf cart. Gower was \"deeply unhappy\" that the Penrith Panthers club did not defend his reputation, and at one stage threatened to \"walk\" from the club.\n\nAllegedly inebriated with alcohol in a bar at Kings Cross on 11 February 2007, Gower allegedly tried to kiss one man before biting him on the neck and sparking a brawl, and is accused of assaulting another man. The Panthers club controversially reappointed Gower as captain in 2007, claiming the Peppermint Lounge incident was just a media \"beat-up\". Australian swimmer Dawn Fraser said Gower was unfit to be captain, due to his alleged lewd behaviour at the charity golf event which she attended, and Sarah Maddison, spokesperson for the Women's Electoral Lobby, said \"reappointing Craig Gower would send all the wrong messages.\"\n\n"}

This is a diverse genus, with very different morphological forms. Their characteristics can vary widely.\nThey are commonly called spider orchids, flame orchids or tiger orchids. Their scientific name is derived from the Latin word \"maxilla\", meaning jawbone, reflecting on the column and the base of the lip of some species, that may evoke a protruding jaw.\n\nRecent molecular studies have found \"Maxillaria\" as it has long been viewed to be an unnatural hodgepodge composed of groups not closely related to each other. Hence it has been proposed that the genus should be split into several genera, proposals that have been gaining acceptance. Some of the species long considered members of \"Maxillaria\" have been moved to other genera: \"Camaridium, Heterotaxis, Ornithidium, Brasiliorchis, Christensonella, Nitidibulbon, Sauvetrea, Inti, Mapinguari, Maxillariella, Rhetinantha, Mormolyca\".\n\n\"Maxillaria\" species still included in the smaller version of the genus are distributed in the rainforest at sea level to elevations of 3,500 m, in Latin America from central Mexico to Bolivia, as well as in the West Indies. This is an indication for the different temperature requirements, from warm growing to cold growing, within the genus.\n\nThey are mostly epiphytes, rather large in size, but some are terrestrials or even lithophytes (such as \"M. rupestris\").\n\nMany species are rather large with rampant growth.\n\nTheir pseudobulbs are round or oblong and each carry one or two lanceolate leaves. Some grow close together in a clustered manner on a short rhizome, while in other species the pseudobulbs keep some distance on an elongate rhizome. This rhizome is clothed in a somewhat transparent, silvery-gray velamen.\n\nThe flowers grow solitary on short stalks, called scapes, from the base of the pseudobulb. Most are small to very small, but some species carry large, showy flowers. The flowers are never longer than the leaves. Their free petals and sepals have a typically curved and adnate labellum with three inconspicuous lobes. Or the lip may have a distinct callus on the disc ( = central part of the lip from which the lobes radiate). The papillae (= small warts like glands) and the trichomes of the lip show great diversity. The most common form for the papillae is the conical form with rounded or pointed tips.\n\n\"Maxillaria\" is not one of the popular genera among growers. Only a few species grow big, showy flowers. But some species are nevertheless sought by collectors, mostly for the fragrance of their blossoms, such as \"Maxillaria tenuifolia\".\n\n\n"}

Macy, and 30 of their acting students from New York University, inspired by the historical examples of the Group Theatre and Stanislavski. Atlantic believes that the story of a play and the intent of its playwright are at the core of the creative process.\n\nThe company operates two theaters in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. There is the 199-seat mainstage Linda Gross Theater, which is located at 336 West 20th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, in the parish hall of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, built in 1854 and recently renovated. Additionally, the 99-seat black-box theater, Stage 2, is located at 330 West 16th Street, also between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, in the former Port Authority building. Stage 2, which opened in June 2006, is the home of Atlantic’s new play development program, which encompasses the commissioning of new works, readings, workshops, and fully staged productions.\n\nSince its inception, Atlantic has produced more than 200 plays, including the Tony Award winning productions of \"Spring Awakening\" and \"The Band's Visit\", David Mamet’s adaptation of \"The Voysey Inheritance\" by Harley Granville Barker, Mamet’s \"Romance\", Joe Penhall’s \"Blue/Orange\", \"Dublin Carol\" by Conor McPherson, Woody Allen’s \"Writer’s Block\", the revival of \"Hobson's Choice\", the revivals of Mamet's \"American Buffalo\", \"The Woods\", and \"Edmond\", \"Dangerous Corner\" by J.

This was the first-ever transpacific flight. Kingsford Smith was the pilot of the Fokker F.VII/3m three-engine monoplane \"\"Southern Cross\"\", with Australian aviator Charles Ulm as the relief pilot. The other two crew members were Americans James Warner and Harry Lyon.\n\nIn 1943 in the South-West Pacific, some Australian and American airmen discuss the story of \"Smithy\", Charles Kingsford Smith. The Americans are told the story by an old officer of Smithy, along with a waiter, Stringer, who knew him.\n\nThe story starts in 1917 with his recovering from a wound incurred in fighting over the Western Front. Kingsford Smith is rewarded with the Military Cross and is determined to make a career out of flying.\n\nAfter the war Kingsford Smith visits America and has a brief romance with Kay Sutton (Joy Nichols) but later falls in love with and marries Mary Powell (Muriel Steinbeck).\n\nHe attempts to enter the England to Australia Air Race in 1919 but is stopped by Prime Minister Billy Hughes. Kingsford Smith then decides to become the first person to fly from the United States to Australia across the Pacific. He does the trip with Charles Ulm (John Tate) in an aircraft called the \"Southern Cross\" and becomes world-famous.\n\nKingsford Smith attempts to set up his own airline but is not successful and is forced to take people on joy flights to make a living. He breaks another record, crossing the Pacific from the Australia to the United States in a single engine aircraft with P.G. Taylor (Captain P.G. Taylor). Kingsford Smith almost dies flying to New Zealand with Bill Taylor and John Stannage (John Stannage as himself), and subsequently, retires the \"Southern Cross\".\n\nIn 1935 Kingsford Smith attempts to fly from Australia to England but disappears over the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"Smithy\" was the idea of N.P. Pery, the managing director of Columbia Pictures in Australia. The Australian government had restricted the export of capital during the war, and Pery thought making a film could use up some of that money. Pery:\n\"Although I represent an American company, I have no hesitation in saying that I firmly believe the production of British films will blossom out, and will in time take its place side by side with the production of American films. Furthermore, I do not think I am indulging in Utopian fancies when I say that Australia, or rather, some spot in Australia, could be made the Hollywood of the British Commonwealth.\"\nPery approached Ken G. Hall, who was Australia's most commercially successful director, and asked him to make a film about an Australian who was well-known internationally. Hall says he briefly considered Don Bradman but never seriously because Bradman was not known in the United States. The three main candidates were Ned Kelly, Dame Nellie Melba and Charles Kingsford Smith. Hall said he decided against Kelly because too many bad films had been made about him. Melba was eventually rejected because of the costs involved with producing opera sequences and the difficulty of finding an appropriate singer to stand in for Melba. That left Kingsford Smith, who appealed in part because of his connection to the United States.\n\nHall commissioned treatments from several writers, including Jesse Lasky, Jr., who was then stationed at Cinesound Productions with the US Signal Corps; Josephine O'Neill, a Sydney film critic; Kenneth Slessor, film critic and poet; and Max Afford, one of Australia's leading playwrights and radio writers. Early drafts focused on Smithy's first flight across the Pacific but then Hall decided to cover most of Smithy' life.\n\nHall felt Afford's version was the best and the two of them developed a detailed treatment. Afford signed a contract in June 1944.\n\nThe treatment was adapted by Alec Coppel, an Australian writer who had enjoyed success in London and returned to Australia during the war. Sydney journalist Norman Ellison provided research.\n\nKen G. Hall looked at 60 applicants to play the title role in \"Smithy\", screen testing eight. \n\nHall says the choice came down to Peter Finch and Ron Randell, a radio and theatre actor. Hall preferred Finch but sent extensive screen tests of both actors with Muriel Steinbeck back to Columbia in Hollywood. The studio picked Randell on the grounds of his greater romantic appeal. Muriel Steinbeck later confirmed that Hall wanted Finch but Columbia did not feel he had sufficient \"sex appeal.\" She says that Hall then wanted Dick Bentley but Columbia did not want to cast a comedian. Ron Randell was cast instead.\n\n\"Filmink\" magazine later wrote \"While Finch was the better actor, I feel it was the right decision – Randell suited the more conventional, romantic approach Hall wanted to take with the material.\"\n\nMuriel Steinbeck was the only actor considered for the female lead in \"Smithy\". She had previously appeared with Randell in \"A Son Is Born\", a film whose release was held up to take advantage of publicity for \"Smithy\".\n\nAlthough \"Smithy\" was entirely financed by Columbia Pictures, Ken G. Hall made it using his old Cinesound crew and shot it mostly at Cinesound's studio in Bondi.\n\nThe aircraft used in \"Smithy\" was the genuine \"Southern Cross\", which has been purchased by the Australian Government 10 years earlier and refurbished by the RAAF. A surplus RAAF CAC Boomerang was used in flying sequences for Kingsford Smith's \"Lady Southern Cross\" Lockheed Altair.\n\nTwo former co-pilots of Kingsford Smith, P.G. Taylor and Harry Purvis play themselves, as does former Prime Minister Billy Hughes. Hughes plays himself as a younger man interviewing Kingsford Smith. Hall says Alec Coppel wrote a scene where Kingsford Smith tries to persuade Hughes let him compete in an air race and Hughes switches off his hearing aid. Hughes was sensitive, however, about his deafness and references to it were removed in the shooting script.\n\n\"Smithy\" featured the first on screen appearance of noted Australian actor Charles \"Bud\" Tingwell who was cast as a RAAF control tower officer – winning the role as he could supply his own RAAF uniform.\n\n\"Smithy\" had its world premiere at a gala screening in Sydney on 26 June 1946, attended by the cast and crew, the Premier of New South Wales, and Shirley Ann Richards, who was visiting Australia at the time.\n\nReviews were generally positive, although not without criticisms.\n\n\"Filmink\" magazine later commented Steinbeck had \"a “wife” part but a decent one – she gets to flirt, and worry and fight, and the film improves immeasurably once her character becomes part of the action.\" \n\n\"Smithy\" was released in the United States as \"Pacific Adventure\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" noted the film \"... is obviously from Australia, although there is no mention of the fact ... while technically acceptable is pretty much a stereotype of all the other histories of aviation pioneering... Ron Randell makes a likeable hero.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" wrote that \"... it is unfortunate that the people who made this picture ... did not draw a more exciting and exacting drama out of the colourful career of the noted airman ... offers only the sketchiest account of Kingsford Smith's life... the scenarists made the mistake of not looking deep enough into their subject... the facts may be true enough but they seem more fictitious than real.\"\n\n\"Smithy\" was advertised in the United States with the tag line \"Not a war picture\".\n\n\"Smithy\" was the third-most popular film released in Australia in 1946.\n\nPery was keen for Columbia to make further films in Australia. Harry Cohn, head of Columbia, however, was opposed to the idea. He later arranged for \"Smithy\" to be drastically re-cut and re-edited for its US release, calling it \"Pacific Adventure\", removing references to Australia, along with Pery's credit.\n\nCohn did offer Ron Randell a long-term contract in Hollywood, which the actor accepted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2325688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325688", "title": "Peter Martins", "text": "Peter Martins\n\nPeter Martins (born 27 October 1946) is a Danish ballet dancer and choreographer. Martins was a principal dancer with the Royal Danish Ballet and with the New York City Ballet, where he joined George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and John Taras as balletmaster in 1981. He retired from dancing in 1983, having achieved the rank of danseur noble, becoming Co-Ballet Master-In-Chief with Robbins. From 1990 until January 2018, he was solely responsible for artistic leadership of City Ballet.\n\nIn December 2017, Martins took a leave of absence from the New York City Ballet following an allegation of sexual misconduct made against him. Five City Ballet dancers later told the \"New York Times\" that Martins had verbally or physical abused them; Martins denied engaging in any misconduct. Martins retired from the City Ballet on January 1, 2018. A subsequent joint inquiry commissioned by the City Ballet and its School of American Ballet \"did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence\" made against Martins.\n\nMartins was born and raised in Copenhagen, Denmark. His parents were Børge Martins, an engineer, and Tove Christa Ornberg, a pianist. His maternal aunt and uncle, Leif and Elna Ornberg, members of the Royal Danish Ballet, started teaching him ballroom combinations when he was five years of age; when he applied to ballet school, however, he was the subject of discrimination because his aunt and uncle had been Nazi sympathizers. It was his older sisters who originally tried-out for the Royal Ballet of Denmark at the age of seven. When they did, he was sitting in the waiting room reading a \"Donald Duck\" comic book. They were denied admittance. Then Peter was asked to \"point his foot\". He did especially well and was admitted.\n\nMartins began his ballet training in 1953 with the Royal Danish Ballet. He joined the corps de ballet in 1965, and was promoted to soloist in 1967.\n\nMartins left Denmark in 1970 and became a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet (NYCB), though he had been performing as a guest artist since 1967. Martins danced a wide variety of roles, but is most known for the titular role in \"Apollo\" and the Cavalier in Balanchine's \"Nutcracker\". In 1978, he was made the subject of the documentary, \"Peter Martins: A Dancer.\" He danced frequently with Suzanne Farrell. However, he terminated her employment with the NYCB in 1993; she went on to found her own company, which disbanded in 2017.\n\nMartins retired from dancing in 1983, becoming Co-Ballet Master-In-Chief alongside Jerome Robbins, and assumed the job of sole Balletmaster-in-Chief in 1990. Martins was Balanchine's personal choice of successor. However, early in his career as balletmaster, Martins faced criticism for perceived deviations from Balanchine's style. Martins also served as the artistic director and chairman of faculty of the School of American Ballet, the training division of the NYCB and the venue through which it receives most of its dancers. From 1990 until January 2018, he was solely responsible for artistic leadership of City Ballet. He was the subject of the 1991 documentary \"Peter Martins: A Dancer\". In 2005 his salary was $619,000, and in 2008 he received $699,000 in pay and benefits.\n\nMartins regularly choreographed new works for both companies. His first piece was \"Calcium Light Night\", set to music by Charles Ives, which premiered in 1977. His more recent pieces include \"Octet\", \"Friandises\", Stabat Mater and the full-length ballets \"The Sleeping Beauty\", \"Swan Lake\", and \"Romeo \"+\" Juliet\". He also choreographed the Barbie movies \"Barbie in the Nutcracker\" and \"Barbie of Swan Lake\". In 2000, Martins, along with talent scout Irene Diamond, founded the New York Choreographic Institute.\n\nIn December 2017, an investigation was announced by New York City Ballet into accusations by dancers within the company of physical and sexual assault by Martins, and using his power to obtain sexual favors, dating back to 1983. One of his accusers, Wilhelmina Frankfurt, a former New York City Ballet ballerina and later a dance educator, said: \"Am I a victim of Martins abuse? Yes. Was it sexual? Yes. Was it consensual? No [...] It was scary. One incident that occurred [...] He [...] pulled me into his dressing room and, exposed himself to me. [And one incident is] so big I don’t think I can talk about it.\"\n\nMartins took a leave of absence that month from both the New York City Ballet and its School of the American Ballet, after the allegations came to light, and in January 2018 he retired. Martins denied any misconduct. A two-month investigation of the New York City Ballet and its School of the American Ballet \"did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence both made in the anonymous letter and reported in the media regarding Mr. Martins\". This was not a criminal investigation and was conducted by NYCB, Inc.'s own attorneys.\n\nHe received a Dance Magazine Award and Cue's Golden Apple Award in 1977. An Award for Arts and Culture, City of New York, 1981. The title of Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1983. An award of Merit, Philadelphia Art Alliance, 1985. And a Liberty Award, 1986. He was nominated for the 1986 Tony Award for Best Choreographer for \"Song & Dance\". Martins is a champion of contemporary music, working often with composer John Adams. His autobiography, \"Far From Denmark\" was published in 1982. Martins was named Man of the Year by the Danish American Society, 1980. His exercise regimen, titled \"NYCB Workout\" and designed with the New York Sports Club, first appeared in book form in 1997, with a DVD and a sequel produced later. Martins was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nMartins had a longterm romantic relationship with Heather Watts during her career as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet. John Clifford, a principal dancer and choreographer under George Balanchine, recalled \"I saw him pick her up and slam her into a cement wall.\" In ballerina Gelsey Kirkland's book \"Dancing on My Grave\" (1986), she describes Martins dragging Watts up and down a flight of stairs.\n\nHe was first married to Lise la Cour, a ballerina he danced with at the Royal Ballet of Denmark. He had a child with her, Nilas. They met while they were both with the Royal Ballet of Denmark and after their divorce, he was a guest-artist with the New York City Ballet and eventually defected to America to dance with the latter company full-time. Nilas eventually followed his father to America, to New York City and to the New York City Ballet.\n\nIn July 1992, Martins was arrested and held for five hours after his 28-year-old wife of seven months, New York City Ballet principal ballerina Darci Kistler, phoned the police for help. His wife filed an affidavit accusing him of assaulting her, pushing and slapping her, and cutting and bruising her arms and legs and continuing to hit her after she fell under his attack. He was charged with third-degree assault (a misdemeanor). Kistler dropped the charges a few days later, saying she preferred to resolve the matter without the court's intervention. When she next performed in a ballet two days later, she reportedly wore heavy makeup to conceal bruises she had suffered. Several people who knew the two well claimed it wasn't the first time Martins had hit her. Peter Wolff, a member of the school’s board of directors, said that the assault charge was \"a personal matter\", would not affect Martins’ career, and that it had \"nothing to do with his competency or his support in the ballet community.\"\n\nIn 2011, Martins was charged with DWI in Yonkers. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of driving while impaired. In December 2017, Martins was arrested after a three-car crash and charged with drunk driving, refusal to take a breath test, and backing unsafely. He pleaded not guilty in Ardsley Village Court, and his license was suspended.\n\nKistler and Martins have one daughter, Talicia Tove Martins, born June 13, 1996. He has a son, Nilas Martins, who also was a member of NYCB before himself retiring.\n\n"}

{"id": "2325724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325724", "title": "Neil Brooks", "text": "Neil Brooks\n\nNeil Brooks (born 27 July 1962) is an Australian former sprint freestyle swimmer best known for winning the 4 × 100 m medley relay at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow as part of the \"Quietly Confident Quartet\". Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents. He often found himself in conflict with officialdom and threatened with sanctions. His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of beer on the return flight to Australia after the 1986 Commonwealth Games. In retirement, he became a news presenter and sports commentator, but was fired amid alcohol problems.\n\nBorn in England, Brooks emigrated to Australia as a toddler and started swimming lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, but it was not until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100 m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100 m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4 × 100 m medley relay, when he caught and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.\n\nFollowing the Olympics, Brooks was expelled from the Australian Institute of Sport by Don Talbot for disciplinary reasons. He accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas, where he enjoyed the more liberal disciplinary standards. He returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp. After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions, Brooks was involved in a physical altercation with the team manager. As a result, he was given a suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games. However, his teammates protested and threatened to walk out, resulting in the ban being rescinded. Despite the turbulent preparation, Brooks had a successful meet, winning the 100 m freestyle and anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals. Brooks competed at his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984 Games, where he won silver in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay. Brooks' international career ended at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh with silver in the 100 m freestyle and gold in the freestyle relay. Brooks retired after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip. He later became a swimming commentator but was sacked in 1998 after a disciplinary incident.\n\nAn only child, Brooks was born in Crewe, England, before migrating to Western Australia when he was four, along with his working-class parents Mick and Norah. His first aquatic adventure was almost his last. Aged seven, he was playing with a friend on the shore of the Swan River when they climbed into a boat that drifted deeper into water and overturned. Brooks was forced to cling to the boat as his friend swam ashore to seek help. His parents immediately enrolled him in swimming lessons at the Marylands Swim Club. Shortly after, he switched to the tutelage of Kevin Duff, who coached him for the next fifteen years. After just six weeks under Duff, Brooks came third in the 50 m breaststroke at the State Age Championships. Despite coaching the likes of Olympic medallists Kevin O'Halloran, Lyn McClements, David Dickson and Lynne Watson, Duff was virtually unknown outside Western Australia. Brooks was known for his rebellious nature, and had a glowing assessment of his coach, opining that \"He's not pushy like many other Australian coaches and he's not in the politics of Australian swimming\".\n\nBrooks attended Hale Primary School and trained at Beatty Park Pool, routinely dominating the State Age Championships. He won bronze in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, and silver in the 200 m freestyle at the 1974 Australian Age Championships. Owing to a lack of style, he was known during his primary school years as \"Basher Brooks\", but by the time he entered Churchlands Senior High School, his stroke had become more technically refined. Nevertheless, he was always confident in his mental ability, stating \"before I just swam on guts, now I had the stroke as well as the guts. I was always the toughest kid in the race.\"\n\nAt the age of 13, Brooks suffered a loss of confidence. After being champion in all four strokes for the previous four years, he was now frequently losing. The other children had grown more at the start of their adolescence and he was struggling to match them. Within a year, Brooks' physical growth began to catch up and he started to regain the dominant position. He also switched from distance to sprint events.\n\nIn 1976, at the age of 13, Brooks competed at his first open Australian Championships, but did not gain any podium finishes and as such missed selection in the team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In the same year, the Australian team came to Perth for its pre-Olympic training camp and were billeted in the homes of members of the local swimming community. Brooks' family took his future relay team-mate Mark Tonelli, who had a reputation for indiscipline. Brooks, however, was inspired by Tonelli and cited him as a key motivating factor in him wanting to become an Olympian.\n\nDuring the 1976–77 season, Brooks came to prominence as a possible Australian representative sprinter. He broke six records in winning two events at the 1977 Western Australian Championships. He swam the 100 m freestyle in 56.56 s, breaking the state records for 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds, before repeating the achievement in the 200 m backstroke. Still aged 14, he competed at his second Australian Championships and came fourth in the 100 m freestyle. In 1978, he came third in the 100 m freestyle and missed selection for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada by 0.03 s. He spent the rest of the year training and studying accounting at Leederville Technical College. During the year, Brooks set Australian age group records in the 200 m individual medley, the 200 m backstroke and the 100 m freestyle. At the inaugural Australian Short Course Championships in Launceston, Tasmania in 1979, he won silver in the 200 m individual medley and bronze in the 100 m freestyle. His performances earned him selection in the Australian team for the first time, competing in the FINA Swimming World Cup event in Tokyo in April 1979, aged 16 years and nine months.\n\nAged 17, Brooks swam 51.91 s in Perth in January 1980, breaking Tonelli's Australian record in the 100 m freestyle. As a result, he was invited to his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100 m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100 m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80 s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4 × 100 m medley relay.\n\nHowever, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.\n\nThe 4 × 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Brooks' Moscow campaign and it came only two days before his 18th birthday. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level in 1960, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia were regarded as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threats; Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts boasted the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would place fourth a few days later. The British had Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Peter Evans was the only individual medallist over a 100 m race, claiming bronze in the breaststroke. Mark Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100 m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its \"de facto\" leader. He asked his team-mates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome as the \"Quietly Confident Quartet\", and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.\n\nKerry led off in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87 s. This left Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, leaving the team almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the disparity in the strength of his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. At the halfway mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his team mates. The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. Brooks dedicated the team's win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas. Upon returning to Australia, he was greeted as a hero, but he considered retiring due to waning desire for success after his triumph in Moscow. In 2000, Brooks and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.\n\nIn the individual event, which occurred after the relay, Brooks had come equal first in his heat with eventual bronze medallist Per Johansson from Sweden in a time of 52.11 s. This made him the seventh fastest qualifier for the semi-finals, but he suffered a severe asthma attack and had to be hospitalised. He swam the semi-final regardless, despite having a heart-rate before the start of race of 120, compared to his usual 72. He finished seventh in a time of 52.70 s, which saw him place 14th, missing the final by 0.83 s.\n\nBrooks suffered from a lack of motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis Pursley, but his stay was brief. The inaugural director Don Talbot, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline. He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100 m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61 s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that \"In Australia, after a race they want to lock you in your room. In America, you can share a beer after the meet with the coach.\" The shortcourse pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50 m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50 m and 100 m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference, and was fourth in the 100 m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100 m freestyle at the AACC Championships to Rowdy Gaines, who went on to win the event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nDespite his successes in America, the Australian Swimming Union did not offer to fund a return home for Brooks for the 1982 Australian Championships, but the University of Arkansas paid his fare as a reward for his performances in collegiate competition. Despite failing to defend his 100 m title, he qualified for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The team then went into a five-week training camp in the seaside Sydney suburb of South Coogee. The team resided at a migrant hostel, which at the time was primarily occupied by Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War. Brooks spoke out about the quality of the accommodation, leading officials to make improvements.\n\nBrooks' protests against the accommodation was overshadowed by a much-publicised physical confrontation with a team official. He telephoned his coach in the United States to make return travel arrangements for the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. Due to the difference in time zones, he made his call after the team curfew, prompting team manager Jeff Hare to attempt to disconnect the line. After Hare threatened to expel him from the team, Brooks lost his temper and pinned the manager against the wall. The swimmer was summoned to a meeting with ASU officials the following day, where he remained unrepentant. He received a one-month ban, effective after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. Brooks demanded that if the ASU were to suspend him, they should do so immediately for the Commonwealth Games, rather than letting him compete and win medals before punishing him. His complaints about the training conditions had gained the attention of his team-mates, and several senior swimmers threatened to leave if he was banned. In the end, the ASU rescinded the suspension. Brooks has remained strongly critical of the attitude of swimming bureaucracy, claiming that \"too many officials expect unquestioning obedience\", calling for the formation of a swimmers' committee.\n\nArriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks and some of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads, something that received much attention from the Australian public. He won his heat of the 100 m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09 s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14 s was enough to secure the gold medal in a close contest. Just 0.43 s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.\n\nBrooks then won gold as part of the winning 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost three seconds, putting in a split of 50.56 s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the \"Mean Machine\". He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44 s. Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians, but were disqualified for an early changeover. After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.\n\nBrooks came into the 1984 Australian Championships as the favourite, but this time he was on the receiving end of a close result. He placed third in the 100 m freestyle behind Mark Stockwell and Delany, missing individual selection by 0.05 s. The trio was separated by a total of only 0.15 s. Selected as a relay swimmer only, he went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, an event that the United States had always won.\n\nDuring the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell showed their intention to deny the Americans the gold for the first time at Olympic level. Drawn alongside the Americans in the third and final heat, the Australians set a new Olympic record of 3 m 19.94 s. Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36 s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41 s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20 s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, the Americans had more speed in reserve, having rested 200 m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100 m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.\n\nIn the final, Australian coach Terry Buck switched the swimming order, putting Fasala as the leadoff leg, while the Americans brought in Heath and Gaines. Fasala's time of 51.00 s put the Australians second at the first change, behind the Americans, for whom Chris Cavanaugh had built a 0.17 s lead. After the first leg, the race was still close—0.90 s separated all the teams. Brooks completed his leg in 49.36 s, the fourth fastest in the race, 0.24 s faster than his American counterpart Heath, giving the Australians a slender 0.07 s lead at the halfway point. Australia and the United States had broken away from the field, which was now the best part of two seconds in arrears. However, the Australian lead was short-lived. Matt Biondi took 0.59 s from Delany and Gaines took another 0.13 s from Stockwell, as the United States won in a world record time of 3 m 19.03 s. Australia were 0.65 s behind with Sweden a further 2.99 s in arrears. Brooks remained adamant that either he or Stockwell should have led off, stating that \"the gold was there for the taking\".\n\nBrooks collected a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before being replaced by first-choice Stockwell in the final. Competing in the third and final heat, Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats, pulling out a 0.40 s margin over Tom Jager. Australia again qualified fastest, but the Americans again had more in reserve, having rested all of their first-choice quartet in the heats. Stockwell combined with Kerry, Evans and Glenn Buchanan to finish behind the United States and Canada in the final, missing silver by just 0.02 s. Australia improved on their qualifying time by only 0.68 s, while the Americans sped up by 5.03 s.\n\nIn 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100 m freestyle at the Australian Championships, clocking a time of 51.12 s. He then combined with Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100 m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100 m freestyle in a time of 51.01 s. He claimed gold in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.\n\nBrooks retired thereafter, moving to Nambour, Queensland and starting a rock band called \"The Union\". He played the electric guitar, and also wrote his own music and songs. He also represented Western Australia in water polo and indoor cricket and played Australian rules football at district level.\n\nHaving graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in journalism in 1985, Brooks entered the media. Before his graduation, he had been a cadet with the Seven Network in Perth for five years, reading the sports segment on the weekday evening news. He was a television commentator at the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. Aside from covering the swimming and water polo, he also commentated on volleyball and in 1998, he called various downhill skiing events at the Nagano Winter Olympics. Domestically, Brooks called Australian Football League matches and read the sports segment on the weekday evening news for the Seven Network. For three years, he hosted \"Brooksy's Footy Show\", a Western Australian travel/holiday show called \"Wild West\", and in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics, co-hosted \"The Games\" with Tracey Holmes.\n\nHowever, Brooks' career began to unravel in the late-1990s. He became addicted to alcohol, leading to a series of on-screen incidents. He once read the sports news segment while inebriated, and was then involved in a drunken argument with the Nine Network's Australian rules football pundit Sam Newman. In early 1999, Seven suspended Brooks from on-screen duties for six weeks after he made comments that they deemed to be \"tasteless and offensive\". In an interview with a magazine that had not been authorised by Seven, Brooks was asked what event he was looking forward to most at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, and replied \"The after-Olympics piss-up\". He was eventually sacked, denying him the opportunity to commentate on the swimming events and costing him an annual salary of AUD700,000.\n\nIn late 2000, Brooks was declared bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth after failing to repay a 14,941.64 debt to BankWest. In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then announced that he would be leaving the state. Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started \"Local\", which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: \"I was over the moon. Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [sic].\" Brooks stood 200 cm and weighed 95 kg during his career, but in the early part of the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150 kg. As of 2007, he had lost substantial weight and fought off his alcohol problems.\n\nBrooks later became a partner in Nitro Energy Drink Company, which was involved in motorsport sponsorship. However, the firm suffered from financial trouble and he had a falling out with his business partner. In 2009, Brooks was removed from the board and the company was put into administration, and both he and his former partner have started legal proceedings.\n\nBrooks' first marriage was to Lynette Quinlivan in January 1985. Their son Luke is a member of the Australian water polo team, playing as a goalkeeper. In 2000, he married his third wife Elle.\n\nOn 13 October 2017 Linda Brooks was arrested in Perth after returning there from Bali. An extradition request to Queensland was granted. Police there wish to question her over an alleged fraud in 2008 relating to a sports clothing company which she was a director of. They also wish to question her husband Neil. On 13 November she is due to appear before a Brisbane magistrate’s court.\n\n\n"}

He established the first modern Indian research school in chemistry (post classical age) and is regarded as the father of chemical science in India.\n\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry honoured his life and work with the first ever Chemical Landmark Plaque outside Europe. He was the founder of Bengal Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals, India's first pharmaceutical company. He is the author of \" A History of Hindu Chemistry from the Earliest Times to the Middle of Sixteenths Century\" (1902).\n\nPrafulla Chandra Ray was born in the village of Raruli-Katipara, then in the Jessore District (subsequently in the Khulna District), which was then situated in the eastern portion of the Bengal Presidency of British India (now in present-day Bangladesh). He was the third child and son of Harish Chandra Raychowdhury (d. 1893), a Kayastha \"zamindar\" (landed proprietor) and his wife Bhubanmohini Devi (d. 1904), the daughter of a local \"taluqdar\". Ray was one of seven siblings, having four brothers – Jnanendra Chandra, Nalini Kanta, Purna Chandra and Buddha Dev – and two sisters, Indumati and Belamati, both born after their brothers; of Ray's siblings, all except Buddha Dev and Belamati survived to adulthood.\n\nRay's great-grandfather Maniklal had been a \"dewan\" under the British East India Company's district collector of Krishnanagar and Jessore, and had amassed considerable wealth in the service of the Company. After succeeding to his father's post, Ray's grandfather Anandlal, a progressive man, sent his son Harish Chandra to receive a modern education at Krishnagar Government College. At the college, Harish Chandra received a thorough grounding in English, Sanskrit and Persian, though he was ultimately forced to end his studies to help support his family. Liberal and cultured, Harish Chandra pioneered English-medium education and women's education in his village, establishing both a middle school for boys and one for girls, and admitting his wife and sister to the latter. Harish Chandra was strongly associated with the Brahmo Samaj, and Ray would maintain his connections with the Samaj throughout his life.\n\nIn 1866, Ray began his education in the village school run by his father, and studied there until he was nine. After Ray's elder brother Jnanendra Chandra completed his middle school studies, his father elected to move the family to Calcutta, where centres of higher learning were more easily accessible. Thus in 1870 or 1871, when Ray was about 10, his family migrated to the city, where Harish Chandra rented a house at 132 Amherst Street. Ray was admitted to the Hare School the following year. In 1874, while Ray was in the fourth standard, he suffered a severe attack of dysentery and was consequently forced to postpone his studies and return to his ancestral home. He later considered this disruption in his studies as a blessing in disguise as it allowed him to read much more widely than what would have been possible within the constraints of school curricula. While convalescing, he read biographies, articles on science, Lethbridge's 'Selections from Modern English Literature' and Goldsmith's \"Vicar of Wakefield\", among others. He also studied history, geography, Bengali literature, Greek, Latin, French and Sanskrit. Although he made a full recovery, he suffered residual bouts of indigestion and insomnia for the rest of his life.\nAfter recovering from his illness, Ray returned to Calcutta in 1876 and was admitted to the Albert School, established by the Brahmo reformer Keshub Chandra Sen; owing to his concentrated self-study over the preceding two years, his teachers found him to have advanced much further than the rest of the students in his assigned class. During this period, he attended Sen's Sunday evening sermons and was deeply influenced by his \"Sulabha Samachar\". In 1878, he passed the school's Entrance Examination (matriculation exams) with a First Division, and was admitted as an FA (First Arts) student to the Metropolitan Institution (later Vidyasagar College) which was established by Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. The English literature teacher at the Institution was Surendranath Banerjee, the prominent Indian nationalist and future president of the Indian National Congress, whose passionately held ideals including an emphasis on the value of service and the need to continually strive for India's rejuvenation left a definite and lasting impression on Ray, who took those values to heart. While deeply influenced by Sen, Ray preferred a more democratic environment than the mainstream Brahmo Samaj under Sen's guidance could provide; consequently, in 1879 he joined the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, a more flexible offshoot of the original Samaj.\n\nThough Ray had primarily focused on history and literature until this stage, chemistry was then a compulsory subject in the FA degree. As the Metropolitan Institution offered no facilities for science courses at the time, Ray attended physics and chemistry lectures as an external student at the Presidency College. He was especially drawn to the chemistry courses taught by Alexander Pedler, an inspiring lecturer and experimentalist who was among the earliest research chemists in India. Soon captivated by experimental science, Ray decided to make chemistry his career, as he recognised that his country's future would greatly depend on her progress in science. His passion for experimentation led him to set up a miniature chemistry laboratory at a classmate's lodgings and reproducing some of Pedler's demonstrations; on one occasion, he narrowly escaped injury when a faulty apparatus exploded violently. He passed the FA exam in 1881 with a second division, and was admitted to the BA (B-course) degree of the University of Calcutta as a chemistry student, with a view towards pursuing higher studies in the field. Having learnt Latin and French in addition to achieving a \"fair mastery\" of Sanskrit, a compulsory subject at the FA level, Ray applied for a Gilchrist Prize Scholarship while studying for his BA examination; the scholarship required a knowledge of at least four languages. After an all-India competitive examination, Ray won one of the two scholarships, and enrolled as a BSc. student at the University of Edinburgh without completing his original degree. He sailed for the United Kingdom in August 1882, aged 21.\n\nAt Edinburgh, Ray began his chemistry studies under Alexander Crum Brown and his demonstrator John Gibson, a former student of Brown's who had also studied under Robert Bunsen at the University of Heidelberg. He received his BSc. in 1885. During his student years at Edinburgh, Ray continued to nurture his strong interests in history and political science, reading works by prominent authors including Rousselet's \"L'Inde des Rajas\", Lanoye's \"L'Inde contemporaine\", \"Revue dex deux mondes\". He also read Fawcett's book on political economy and \"Essays on Indian Finance\". In 1885, he entered an essay competition held by the university for the best essay on \"India before and after the Mutiny.\" His submission, which was strongly critical of the British Raj and warned the British government of the consequences of its reactionary attitudes, was nonetheless assessed as one of the best entries and was highly praised by William Muir, the recently appointed Principal of the University and a former lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces in India. Ray's essay was widely publicised in Britain, with \"The Scotsman\" observing \"It contains information in reference to India which will not be found elsewhere, and is deserving of the utmost notice.\" A copy of the paper was read by the distinguished orator and Liberal Member of Parliament for Birmingham John Bright; Bright's sympathetic reply to Ray was published in leading newspapers across Britain under the title \"John Bright's Letter to an Indian Student.\" The following year, Ray published his paper as a booklet entitled \"Essay on India,\" which likewise earned its author wide attention in British political circles.\n\nAfter obtaining his BSc degree, Ray embarked on his doctoral studies. Although his thesis advisor Crum Brown was an organic chemist, Ray was drawn towards inorganic chemistry at a time when research in the field appeared to be making limited progress compared to organic chemistry. Following an extensive review of available inorganic chemistry literature, Ray decided to explore the specific natures of structural affinities in double salts as the subject of his thesis. Within this area, Ray chose to research metal double sulfates.\n\nFor some years, science had recognised numerous double sulfates (then also known as \"vitriols\") occurred in nature as mineral salts. The natural combination of sulfates of bivalent metals with monovalent metal sulfates in a 1:1 ratio results in the formation of double sulfates chemically distinct from their original constituent species. By the 1850s, a number of double sulfates had been artificially synthesized, including ammonium iron(II) sulfate or \"Mohr's salt\" by Karl Friedrich Mohr. Some chemists, including one Vohl, subsequently claimed to have isolated numerous double-double and multiple-double sulfates including supposed \"triple-double,\" and \"quadruple-double\" structures. These were purportedly the result of two double sulfates of Type I (differing in the bivalent metal Mb) combining in definite integral proportions to yield new molecular double salts. Others who had attempted to reproduce those experiments reported their inability to do so. Prior to Ray's taking up the problem, in 1886, Percival Spencer Umfreville Pickering and Emily Aston had concluded in their paper that double-double and higher-order sulfate salts did not exist as definite structures, deeming Vohl's experimental findings inexplicable. While Ray noted such findings placed Vohl's research in doubt, he reasoned \"the position was unclear and further research was called for.\"\n\nRay was awarded the Hope Prize which allowed him to work on his research for a further period of one year after completion of his doctorate. His thesis title was \"Conjugated Sulphates of the Copper-magnesium Group: A Study of Isomorphous Mixtures and Molecular Combinations\". While a student he was elected Vice-President of the University of Edinburgh Chemical Society in 1888.\n\nPrafulla Chandra returned to India in the first week of August 1888 and subsequently joined Presidency College, Calcutta as temporary Assistant Professor of Chemistry in 1889. Ray who had a doctorate in science from the University of Edinburgh felt deeply aggrieved when even with his excellent educational credentials he was not able to secure a position within the Imperial service (his academic position was within the 'provincial service') and attributed this to the discriminatory attitude of the ruling government towards native intelligentsia. He complained to the top officials of the government but with no effect.\n\nAround 1895 Prafulla Chandra started his work in the field of discovering nitrite chemistry which turned out to be extremely effective. In 1896, he published a paper on preparation of a new stable chemical compound: mercurous nitrite. This work made way for a large number of investigative papers on nitrites and hyponitrites of different metals, and on nitrites of ammonia and organic amines. He and his students had crumbled this field for several years, leading to a long discipline of research laboratories. Prafulla Chandra said that it was a new chapter in life that started with the unanticipated discovery of mercurous nitrite. Prafulla Chandra, in 1896, noticed the formation of a yellow crystalline solid with the reaction of mercury and dilute nitric acid.\n\nThis result was first published in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal. That was forthwith noticed by Nature magazine on May 28, 1896.\n\nAmmonium nitrite synthesis in pure form through double displacement ammonium between chloride and silver nitrite is one of the notable contributions of P C Ray. He proved that the pure ammonium nitrite is indeed stable by bring to pass a lot of experiments and explained thet it can be sublimed even at 60 °C without decomposition.\n\nOn a conference of the Chemical Society in London, he submitted the result. Nobel laureate William Ramsay congratulated him for his achievement. On August 15, 1912, Nature magazine published the news of 'ammonium nitrite in tangible form' and the determination of the vapour density of 'this very fugitive salt'. The Journal of Chemical Society, London published the experimental details in the same year.\n\nHe prepared a lot of such compounds by double displacement. After that he worked on mercury alkyl- and mercury alkyl aryl-ammonium nitrites.\n\nHe started a new Indian School of Chemistry in 1924. Ray was president of the 1920 session of the Indian Science Congress.\n\nPrafulla Chandra retired from the Presidency College in 1916, and joined the Calcutta University College of Science (also known as\nRajabazar Science College) as its first \"\"Palit Professor of Chemistry\"\", a chair named after Taraknath Palit. Here also he got a dedicated team and he started working on compounds of gold, platinum, iridium etc. with mercaptyl radicals and organic sulphides. A number of papers were published on this work in the Journal of the Indian Chemical Society.\n\nIn 1936, at the age of 75, he retired from active service and became Professor Emeritus. Long before that, on the completion of his 60th year in 1921, he made a free gift of his entire salary to the Calcutta University from that date onward, to be spent for the furtherance of chemical research, and the development of the Department of Chemistry in the University College of Science.\n\nHe had written 107 papers in all branches of Chemistry by 1920.\n\nHe contributed articles in Bengali to many monthly magazines, particularly on scientific topics. He published the first volume of his autobiography \"Life and Experience of a Bengali Chemist\" in 1932, and dedicated it to the youth of India. The second volume of this work was issued in 1935.\n\nIn 1902, he published the first volume of \"A History of Hindu Chemistry from the Earliest Times to the Middle of Sixteenth Century\". The second volume was published in 1909. The work was result of many years' search through ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and through works of orientalists.\n\nIn 1923, Northern Bengal suffered a flood which made millions of people homeless and hungry. Prafulla Chandra organised Bengal Relief Committee, which collected nearly 2.5 million rupees in cash and kind and distributed it in the affected area in an organised manner.\n\nHe donated money regularly towards welfare of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, Brahmo Girls' School and Indian Chemical Society. In 1922, he donated money to establish Nagarjuna Prize to be awarded for the best work in chemistry. In 1937, another award, named after Ashutosh Mukherjee, to be awarded for the best work in zoology or botany, was established from his donation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe remained a bachelor throughout his life who took active participation in politics. He was closely associated with Sadharan Brahmo Samaj and occupied various administrative posts during his lifetime and finally elected as the President and Trustee of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. He was elected solely on the basis of his potential, and not because of his father's influence in the Bramho Samaj.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2325729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325729", "title": "Gratification", "text": "Gratification\n\nGratification is the pleasurableemotional reaction of happiness in response to a fulfillment of a desire or goal. It is also identified as a response stemming from the fulfillment of social needs such as affiliation, socializing, social approval, and mutual recognition. \n\nGratification, like all emotions, is a motivator of behavior and thus plays a role in the entire range of human social systems. According to Jonathan Turner's theory of emotions contribute to the emergence and reproduction of social order because people create, reproduce, or change social structure on account of its emotional and material gratification.\n\nThe term immediate gratification is often used to label the satisfactions gained by more impulsive behaviors: choosing now over tomorrow. The skill of giving preference to long-term goals over more immediate ones is known as deferred gratification or patience, and it is usually considered a virtue, producing rewards in the long term. There are sources who claim that the prefrontal cortex plays a part in the incidence of these two types of gratification, particularly in the case of delayed gratification since one of its functions involve predicting future events.\n\nWalter Mischel developed the well-known marshmallow experiment to test gratification patterns in four-year-olds, offering one marshmallow now or two after a delay. He discovered in long-term follow-up that the ability to resist eating the marshmallow immediately was a good predictor of success in later life. However, Tyler W. Watts, Greg J. Duncan, and Haonan Quan, published \"Revisiting the Marshmallow Test: A Conceptual Replication Investigating Links Between Early Delay of Gratification and Later Outcomes\" debunking the original marshmallow experiment. Concluding that \"This bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.\"\n\nWhile one might say that those who lack the skill to delay are immature, an excess of this skill can create problems as well; i.e. an individual becomes inflexible, or unable to take pleasure in life (anhedonia) and seize opportunities for fear of adverse consequences. \n\nThere are also circumstances, in an uncertain/negative environment, when seizing gratification is the rational approach, as in wartime.\n\nGratification is a major issue in bipolar disorder. One sign of the onset of depression is a spreading loss of the sense of gratification in such immediate things as friendship, jokes, conversation, food and sex. Long-term gratification seems even more meaningless. \n\nBy contrast, the manic can find gratification in almost anything, even a leaf falling, or seeing their crush for example. There is also the case of the so-called manic illusion of gratification , which is analogous to an infant's illusion of obtaining food. Here, if the food is not given right away, he fantasizes about it and this eventually give way to stronger emotions such as anger and depression.\n\n"}

After his release in 1944, he joined the Norwegian resistance movement. He also competed in the 1948 Olympics, winning the ski jumping silver medal at age 36, though he was initially only at the Games as assistant coach of Norway’s ski jumping team. This accomplishment he personally held in the highest regard; it made him the first ski jumper to medal in three different Olympics.

He is the current chairman of TUI AG. He was the Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz until 22 May 2019, a role he had held since 2006 in addition to being a member of the company's board since 1998.\n\nZetsche was born while his father, Herbert Zetsche, a civil engineer, was temporarily in Turkey for a dam construction project. The family returned to Germany in 1956. Dieter Zetsche attended school in Oberursel (near Frankfurt am Main) and studied electrical engineering from 1971 to 1976 at the University of Karlsruhe; he graduated as an engineer. He completed his doctorate in engineering in 1982 at the University of Paderborn.\n\nZetsche joined Daimler-Benz in 1976, working in the research department. In 1981, he became Assistant Development Manager at the Vehicles business unit. He became a member of Daimler Chrysler's Board of Management in 1998 and served as the President/CEO of Chrysler Group from mid-2000 to 31 December 2005, where he was credited with a turnaround of DCX's American operations. Since 1 January 2006 he succeeded Jürgen Schrempp as Chairman of DaimlerChrysler (now Daimler AG), being succeeded in the position of Chrysler Group CEO by Thomas W. LaSorda.\n\nZetsche was the main influence behind the demerger of Daimler and Chrysler in 2007, which ended in the newly formed Daimler AG. Following profit warnings in 2012 and 2013, weak sales in China and tensions with Daimler's powerful labour representatives, his contract was renewed for only three years instead of the expected five. He received €14.4 million in pay and bonuses in 2014, making him the second-highest paid employee at a listed German company. After a record year for car sales and revenue in 2015, Zetsche's contract was extended to 2019.\n\nZetsche is credited with bringing significant core changes to the Mercedes-Benz company in an effort to turn around a decade-long downward spiral in product quality and customer satisfaction. He was named in \"Time Magazine\"'s 2006's list of 100 most influential people. On the invitation of the Green Party’s leadership, Zetsche was invited to address the 2016 party conference.\n\nOn 26 September 2018, it was announced that Zetsche will step down as the company's CEO in May 2019 to comply with a two-year-long hiatus regulatory rule before becoming chairman of Daimler's supervisory board in 2021.\n\nAsk Dr. Z campaign\nOn 30 June 2006 Chrysler Group announced the Employee Pricing Plus program, which featured Dieter Zetsche as Dr. Z (Doctor \"Zee\"), the DaimlerChrysler spokesman for a series of United States and Canadian television commercials, also animated in cartoon format on the company's Ask Dr. Z website, which began on 1 July.\n\nThe \"Ask Dr. Z\" campaign included television, radio, print, online, in-dealership and customer relationship marketing media components and aggressive marketing tactics (mobile billboards, aerial banners, street teams), as well as targeting the NASCAR fan community. In the \"Ask Dr. Z\" ad campaign he provides answers to customers' questions and exits by saying \"Auf Wiedersehen\" (German for \"goodbye\" or \"see you again\").\n\nThe ad campaign emphasized the consumer benefits of the best of American and German engineering and design built into every Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicle. One included Zetsche riding in a Jeep Liberty crossing a pile of logs, another showed him at the trunk of a Dodge Caravan minivan heading a soccer ball, and the last showed him at the wheel of a Chrysler Pacifica when it undergoes a crash test where he emerges from the wreckage unscathed.\n\nAs a response to shrinking sales, the Employee Pricing Plus program was extended through the end of August and three new TV ads, which did not feature Dr. Z, were added to the August campaign. After three months however DaimlerChrysler hurriedly withdrew the Dr. Z campaign due to a significant loss in market share. However, some of the Dr. Z ads can still be seen on Canadian television. In later broadcasts, the tagline in Dr. Z TV ads was changed to 'See the best in German and North American design in your Dodge and Chrysler dealer.'\n\nThe campaign was criticized for having the wrong guy for doing funny ads. CNW Marketing Research poll showed most people thought Dr. Z was a fictional character, did not notice the employee discount offer in the ads and radio commercial listeners had difficulty understanding his German accent.\n\nIn February 2018, before the announcement of his departure from Daimler, in the Annual General Meeting held by tourism company TUI AG, Zetsche was elected as a member of the Supervisory Board. This was officially confirmed in May 2019 when Zetsche was announced as new chairman of TUI's Supervisory Board.\n\n\nIn the autumn of 2011, Zetsche was investigated for the involuntary manslaughter of a 27-year-old engineer who died in an accident caused by an intern on one of the firm's test tracks. The newspaper \"Stuttgarter Zeitung\" reported earlier that the parents of the engineer felt the company should not have put the intern behind the wheel of a fast car on a test track. However, it was generally agreed that the public prosecutors were over-reaching their prosecutorial authority in holding Zetsche responsible, as he was not responsible in any way for regulating the limits of interns' activities while at the company.\n\n"}

{"id": "2325765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325765", "title": "N-Trance", "text": "N-Trance\n\nN-Trance () are a British electronic music group who were formed by Kevin O'Toole and Dale Longworth in 1991. The group has sold over 5 million records worldwide and some of their hit singles include \"Set You Free\", \"Forever\", as well as covers of the popular 1970s disco songs \"Stayin' Alive\", \"D.I.S.C.O.\", \"Shake Ya Body , and \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\".\n\nKevin O'Toole and Dale Longworth formed N-Trance, in 1990, after meeting at The Oldham College, where they were both studying sound engineering. Initially, O'Toole and Longworth, along with four or five other students used their college's recording studio for free recording and use of equipment, however they began producing music which they thought was comparable to other rave music in the charts at the time.\n\nTheir first demo tape was a dance remix of the theme tune to \"Roobarb\", a children's television show. The next record the group produced was a more credible dance track, consisting mainly of sampled music, called \"Back to the Bass\". Within days of being recorded, the song had caught the attention of Dead Dead Good Records (owned by the manager of The Charlatans) who had wanted to sign the record, but shortly before signing they were outbid by Pete Waterman's 380 Records (a sub-label of PWL). Following the interest from record labels, the band and their manager decided a new band name was needed. Previously, they had been using a variety of band names such as Quartech, but settled on changing their name and signing their record contract as N-Trance.\n\nHowever, problems with the sample clearance prevented \"Back to the Bass\" from ever being released as a single. The band continued to write and record music, joined by vocalist Kelly Llorenna.\n\n\"Set You Free\" was recorded at Revolution Studios in Cheadle Hulme in July 1992, and it was pressed to 500 12\" vinyl copies on promotional release. However, due to troubles within their record label, this song was not released as a single. N-Trance then chose to buy themselves out of their recording contract with 380 Records, after only one year with the company, and they signed to a new label, All Around the World.\n\nBy now, N-Trance had developed their live shows and were gaining some popularity, and on their new label, \"Set You Free\" was finally released, in 1993, but it failed to enter the Top 40, reaching No. 83 in the charts.\n\nIn 1994, \"Set You Free\" was re-released achieving a higher chart position of No. 39. N-Trance's next single was a eurodance song called \"Turn Up the Power\" which featured vocals from Rachel McFarlane, of Loveland, and a rap by T-1K. This song was a fairly big hit, getting to No. 23.\n\nAfter a few years of performing live over the UK, N-Trance's popularity and the reception towards \"Set You Free\" had increased significantly. The record was in popular demand, and after a third release of the song in 1995, the single became a huge hit, being played by television and radio stations, reaching No. 2 in the charts and being certified Platinum in the UK, after selling over 600,000 copies. The single was also released in other European countries and Australia.\n\nThe group recorded their first full-length album, \"Electronic Pleasure\", in November 1995, which featured seven of the group's ever-expanding roster of vocalists (including David Grant), and musicians such as Vinny Burns and Snake Davis. Similarly, N-Trance's musical range expanded, embracing rap, disco and other styles in its scope.\n\nThe group's next single, a surprising cover of the Bee Gees hit \"Stayin' Alive\", was not only a massive international hit, but also featured a vocalist who would help define N-Trance's sound in the future, Ricardo da Force, formerly rapper with The KLF.\n\nUpon its release in the UK it debuted at no. 2, and internationally it became one of the biggest UK exports of 1995, reaching no. 1 in Australia and being top 5 in a number of European charts.\n\nThe release of further commercially successful singles, like \"Electronic Pleasure\", afforded N-Trance the possibility of building their own recording studio, Deep Blue, in 1996. They spent the following year and a half recording their second full-length album, \"Happy Hour\", which was eventually released in 1999.\n\nHit singles from the album included cover versions of Rod Stewart's \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" and Ottawan's \"D.I.S.C.O.\", and the hardcore techno clatter of \"The Mind of the Machine\", which featured the actor Steven Berkoff.\n\nA best of album, entitled \"The Best of N-Trance 1992–2002\" was released in early 2001, backed by a trance remix of \"Set You Free\" which reached number 4 in October of that year.\n\nIn February 2009, the group released \"The Mind of the Machine\" as their third album. Two new tracks (\"Free Running\" and \"The Earth Is Dying\") were recorded for the album to go with the recordings previously made in 1997.

It is known as part of the \"Golden Triangle of Art\", which also includes the Prado and the Reina Sofia national galleries. The Thyssen-Bornemisza fills the historical gaps in its counterparts' collections: in the Prado's case this includes Italian primitives and works from the English, Dutch and German schools, while in the case of the Reina Sofia it concerns Impressionists, Expressionists, and European and American paintings from the 20th century.\n\nWith over 1,600 paintings, it was once the second largest private collection in the world after the British Royal Collection. A competition was held to house the core of the collection in 1987–88 after Baron Thyssen, having unsuccessfully sought permission to enlarge his Museum in Lugano (Villa Favorita), searched for a better-suited location elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe collection was started in the 1920s as a private collection by Heinrich, Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kászon. In a reversal of the movement of European paintings to the US during this period, one of the elder Baron's sources was the collections of American millionaires coping with the Great Depression and inheritance taxes. In this way he acquired old master paintings such as Ghirlandaio's portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni (once in the Morgan Library) and Carpaccio's \"Knight\" (from the collection of Otto Kahn). The collection was later expanded by Heinrich's son Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza (1921–2002), who assembled most of the works from his relatives' collections and proceeded to acquire large numbers of new works (from Gothic art to Lucien Freud).\n\nThe collection was initially housed in the family estate in Lugano in a twenty-room building modelled after the Neue Pinakothek in Munich. In 1988, the Baron filed a request for building a further extension designed by British architects James Stirling and Michael Wilford, but the plan was rejected by the Lugano City Council.\n\nIn 1985, the Baron married Carmen \"Tita\" Cervera (a former Miss Spain 1961) and introduced her to art collecting. Cervera's influence was decisive in persuading the Baron to relocate the core of his collection to Spain where the local government had a building available next to the Prado. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum officially opened in 1992, showing 715 works of art. A year later, the Spanish Government bought 775 works for $350 million. These pieces are now in the purpose-built museum in Madrid. After the museum opened, in 1999, Cervera loaned 429 works of her own art collection to the museum for 11 years. The loan has been renewed annually since 2012.\n\nThe Baroness remains involved with the museum. She personally decided the salmon pink tone of the interior walls and in May 2006, publicly demonstrated against plans of the Mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón to redevelop the Paseo del Prado as she thought the works and traffic would damage the collection and the museum's appearance.\n\nThe Old Masters were mainly bought by the elder Baron, while Hans focused more on the 19th and 20th century, resulting in a collection that spans eight centuries of European painting, without claiming to give an all-encompassing view but rather a series of highlights.\n\nOne of the focal points is the early European painting, with a major collection of trecento and quattrocento (i.e. 14th and 15th century) Italian paintings by Duccio, Luca di Tommè, Bernardo Daddi, Paolo Uccello, and his contemporaries, and works of the early Flemish and Dutch painters like Jan van Eyck (\"Diptich of the Annunciation\"), Petrus Christus, Rogier van der Weyden, Gerard David and Hans Memling.\n\nOther highlights include works by leading Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo painters, including Antonello da Messina (\"Portrait of a Man\"), Bramantino (\"Christus Dolens\"), Fra Bartolomeo, Giulio Romano, Giovanni Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, Jacopo Bassano, Sebastiano del Piombo (\"Portrait of Ferry Carondelet\"), Bernardino Luini, Agnolo Bronzino, Domenico Beccafumi, Albrecht Dürer (\"Christ among the Doctors\"), Hans Baldung Grien, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Hans Holbein (\"Portrait of Henry VIII\"), Caravaggio (\"Saint Catherine\"), Guercino, Sebastiano Ricci, Rubens, Van Dyck, Murillo, Rembrandt, Frans Hals (\"Family Portrait in a Landscape\"), Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Tiepolo, Giambattista Pittoni, Watteau, François Boucher, Chardin, Fragonard, Gainsborough and Pompeo Batoni, as well as two famous portraits by Domenico Ghirlandaio (\"Giovanna Tornabuoni\") and Vittore Carpaccio (\"Knight in a landscape\").\n\nThe Museum houses a display of North American paintings from 18th and 19th centuries, including Copley, Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent.\n\nThe display of the European 19th century starts with works by Francisco Goya, Thomas Lawrence, Delacroix, Géricault, Corot and Courbet. There are Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by the artists Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Pierre Bonnard, Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh. The large collection of twentieth century modern art includes Cubist works by Picasso, Braque and Juan Gris, as well as paintings by Edvard Munch, Egon Schiele, James Ensor, Kandinsky, Salvador Dalí, Paul Klee, Chagall, Magritte, Piet Mondrian, Edward Hopper, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Roy Lichtenstein, Willem De Kooning and Francis Bacon. The selection of German Expressionism is extensive, and includes Emil Nolde, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, August Macke, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, and Otto Dix.\n\nA collection of works from the museum (Fra Angelico, Cranach, Titian, Canaletto) is housed in Barcelona in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.\n\nOne painting, \"Rue Saint-Honoré in the Afternoon, Effect of Rain\" by Camille Pissarro, belonged to a Jewish woman, Lilly Cassirer who was compelled by a Nazi official to exchange it under duress for an exit visa to escape Nazi Germany shortly after Kristallnacht in 1939. By 2015, her descendants had filed a lawsuit against the museum, on the grounds that it was looted by the Nazis. On May 1st 2019, a California judge determined that the museum held the right to keep the painting, despite international agreements to the contrary. \n\nIn 2011 due to \"a lack of liquid funds\", Cervera decided to sell \"The Lock\" by the English artist John Constable. The painting, which belonged to her private collection, was sold in London the following year for £22.4 million, more than doubling the price paid for it in 1990.\n\n\n"}

At the time the original X1 was released, all other home computers generally had a BASIC language in ROM. However the X1 did not have a BASIC ROM, and it had to load the interpreter from a cassette tape. On the plus side however, this concept meant that a free RAM area was available that was as big as possible when not using BASIC. This policy was originally copied from the Sharp MZ series, and they were called \"clean computers\" in Japan. The cabinet shape of X1 was also much more stylish than others at that time and a range of cabinet colors (including Red) was selectable.\n\nThe RGB display monitor for the X1 had a television tuner, and a computer screen could be super-imposed on TV. All the TV functions could be controlled from a computer program. The character font was completely programmable (A.K.A. PCG) with 4bit color, and was effectively used in many games. The entirety of the VRAM memory was mapped on to the I/O area, so it was controlled without bank switching. Since X1 had these features, it was very powerful for game software.\n\nWhile X1 was struggling to sell, the PC8801 (from NEC) was quickly becoming popular in the Japanese market.

It was first performed at the Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden, London, in late May or early June 1691.\n\nThe plot is based on the battles between King Arthur's Britons and the Saxons, rather than the legends of Camelot (although Merlin does make an appearance). It is a Restoration spectacular, including such supernatural characters as Cupid and Venus plus references to the Germanic gods of the Saxons, Woden, Thor, and Freya. The tale centres on Arthur's endeavours to recover his fiancée, the blind Cornish Princess Emmeline, who has been abducted by his arch-enemy, the Saxon King Oswald of Kent.\n\n\"King Arthur\" is a \"dramatick opera\" or semi-opera: the principal characters do not sing, except if they are supernatural, pastoral or, in the case of Comus and the popular \"Your hay it is mow'd\", drunk. Secondary characters sing to them, usually as diegetic entertainment, but in Act 4 and parts of Act 2, as supernatural beckonings. The singing in Act 1 is religious observance by the Saxons, ending with their heroic afterlife in Valhalla. The protagonists are actors, as a great deal of \"King Arthur\" consists of spoken text. This was normal practice in 17th century English opera. \"King Arthur\" contains some of Purcell's most lyrical music, using adventurous harmonies for the day.\n\nDryden probably wrote the original libretto for \"King Arthur\" in 1684 to mark the 25th anniversary of King Charles II's Restoration the following year. The original text of \"King Arthur\" no longer exists but it was to be in three acts with an allegorical prologue. For unknown reasons Dryden abandoned his intention to have the whole work set to music and developed the prologue into another opera, \"Albion and Albanius\", a collaboration with the Catalan composer Louis Grabu. However, Charles II died in February 1685 and \"Albion and Albanius\" was first inauspiciously performed in June 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion. It was a failure and Dryden shelved any plans he had for the rest of the \"King Arthur\" libretto.\n\nIn the meantime, England entered a turbulent period in its history. After the Catholic James II took the throne, Dryden too converted to Catholicism. When the Protestant William III overthrew James in the Glorious Revolution in 1688, Dryden refused to renounce his faith and so lost his job as poet laureate to his rival Thomas Shadwell. Purcell's career had also suffered after the death of the music-loving Charles II. With their sources of royal patronage gone, both playwright and composer were looking to make money as freelance professionals and the London stage offered attractive opportunities.\n\nIn 1690, the theatre manager Thomas Betterton decided to risk putting on another operatic work, the first since the ill-fated \"Albion and Albanius\". This was the semi-opera \"Dioclesian\" (1690), an adaptation of a play by Beaumont and Fletcher. Purcell's music for the production and the lavish staging made it a triumph and Betterton was eager for another such success. He persuaded Dryden to dust off and revise the libretto for \"King Arthur\" so Purcell could set it. The two had already collaborated on stage works (Dryden had written the prologue for \"Dioclesian\" and Purcell the incidental music for Dryden's comedy \"Amphitryon\") and Dryden was effusive in his praise of Purcell's musical abilities.\n\nIn his preface to the printed edition, Dryden explained he had had to adapt the libretto to the changed political circumstances of 1691: \"But not to offend the present Times, nor a Government which has hitherto protected me, I have been oblig'd so much to alter the first Design, and take away so many Beauties from the Writing, that it is now no more what it was formerly...\" He also made alterations to suit Purcell's musical needs: \"the Numbers of Poetry and Vocal Musick, are sometimes so contrary, that in many places I have been oblig'd to cramp my Verses, and make them rugged to the Reader, that they may be harmonious to the Hearer: Of which I have no Reason to repent me, because these sorts of Entertainments are principally design'd for the Ear and the Eye; and therefore in Reason my Art on this occasion, ought to be subservient to his.\"\n\nThe exact date of the premiere is unknown but the wordbook was advertised in \"The London Gazette\" from 4 to 8 June 1691, suggesting a recent staging. Peter Holman believes it was performed in May. The production was not as spectacular as \"Dioclesian\" or the later \"The Fairy Queen\" but it proved the most financially successful for the theatre. Betterton himself took the role of King Arthur, despite being in his fifties. The contemporary writer Roger North was most impressed by Charlotte Butler's singing of Cupid, describing it as \"beyond anything I ever heard upon the stage\", partly ascribing her success to \"the liberty she had of concealing her face , which she could not endure should be so contorted as is necessary to sound well, before her gallants, or at least her envious sex.\"\n\n\"King Arthur\" was revived at least twice during Purcell's lifetime and continued to be performed in the later 1690s. The first major revival in the eighteenth century was staged in 1736. This production left the work unaltered, but later revivals involved varying degrees of revision. They included a performance in Dublin in 1763; David Garrick and Thomas Arne's version in 1770; and John Kemble and Thomas Linley's transformation of \"King Arthur\" into a two-act after-piece entitled \"Arthur and Emmeline\" in 1784.\n\nAccording to Curtis Price, the original 1684–5 version was probably an allegory of the Exclusion crisis, a major political dispute over who would succeed Charles II: his Catholic brother, James, Duke of York or the Duke of Monmouth, his illegitimate — but Protestant — son. The faction backing James was nicknamed the \"Tories\"; that in favour of Monmouth, the \"Whigs\". The latter were led by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, the Earl of Shaftesbury. Dryden was a convinced Tory and had already satirised Shaftesbury and other Whigs in his poem \"Absalom and Achitophel\" (1681). In Price's reading, King Arthur represents Charles II, the Britons are the Tories, and the Saxons are the Whigs. Oswald is the Duke of Monmouth and Osmond/Grimbald is the Earl of Shaftesbury. Philidel is the Marquess of Halifax, a political moderate much admired by Dryden (he would dedicate the printed edition of \"King Arthur\" to Halifax). Emmeline personifies the \"national conscience.\"\n\nDryden did not base his libretto on standard versions of Arthurian myth, although he was familiar with such books as Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". He did, however, use other works of literature as sources of inspiration. There are clear parallels between \"King Arthur\" and Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" (which Dryden had revised in line with Restoration taste in collaboration with Sir William Davenant in 1667 and which had been turned into a semi-opera with music by Matthew Locke in 1674).\nEllen A. Harris has described the links between the characters: Prospero and Merlin are both good magicians who use an \"airy spirit\" (Ariel in \"The Tempest\", Philidel in \"King Arthur\") to defeat a potential usurper (Alonzo/Oswald). The relationship between Arthur and Emmeline is like that between Ferdinand and Miranda. Like Miranda, Emmeline is an innocent who has \"never seen a man\" (quite literally true in the case of the blind Emmeline). Finally, there are obvious similarities between the \"earthy spirits\" Grimbald and Caliban, although there is no evil wizard corresponding to Osmond in \"The Tempest\".\n\nDryden also used material he found in epic poetry: the idea of the \"enchanted wood\" is taken from Canto XVII of Tasso's \"Gerusalemme liberata\"; and Andrew Pinnock suggests the rivalry between Arthur and Oswald is like the conflict between Gondibert and Oswald in Sir William Davenant's unfinished poem \"Gondibert\" (1650).\n\nIn his preface, Dryden explained how he had conducted historical research into Germanic paganism to write the sacrifice scene in the first act: \"When I wrote it, seven years ago, I employ'd some reading about it, to inform my self out of \"Beda\", \"Bochartus\", and other Authors, concerning the rites of the Heathen \"Saxons\"...\". But Andrew Pinnock believes \"practically all the ritual came from a far handier source (which unaccountably Dryden forgot to mention): Aylett Sammes's \"Britannia Antiqua Illustrata\" (1676).\"\n\nThe \"Frost Scene\" in the third act has always attracted praise from critics. Edward J. Dent wrote that \"The Frost Scene is one of Purcell's most famous achievements\" with \"its bold contrasts of style, and the masterly piling up of the music to a climax at the end of the chorus <nowiki>'</nowiki>'Tis love that has warmed us'.\" Thomas Gray, commenting on the 1736 production, described it as \"excessive fine\" and claimed that the Cold Genius' solo was \"the finest song in the play.\" This aria (\"What power art thou who from below\") is accompanied by shivering strings, probably influenced by a scene from Act IV of Jean-Baptiste Lully's opera \"Isis\" (1677) but, as Peter Holman writes, Purcell's \"daring chromatic harmonies transform the Cold Genius from the picturesque figure of Lully (or Dryden, for that matter) into a genuinely awe-inspiring character — the more so because Cupid's responses are set to such frothy and brilliant music.\" It has been suggested that the whole scene was inspired by the Frost fairs held on the Thames during the 1680s.\n\nVenus' act V air \"Fairest Isle\" achieved wide fame, inspiring Charles Wesley's hymn Love Divine, All Loves Excelling to the same tune.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nThe Britons prepare for the battle which will decide who will rule their land: the Christian Arthur or the heathen Saxon Oswald. It augurs well for them: it is Saint George's Day and the Britons have already defeated the Saxons in ten battles. Conon, Duke of Cornwall, explains the origins of the war. Oswald had sought his daughter, the blind Emmeline's, hand in marriage but she rejected him because she is in love with Arthur. Arthur enters reading a letter of support from his magician Merlin. He meets Emmeline and tries to explain to her what seeing means. A trumpet calls Arthur to battle.\n\n\"Scene 2: The scene represents a place of Heathen worship; The three Saxon Gods, Woden, Thor, and Freya placed on Pedestals. An Altar.\"\n\nOswald and his magician Osmond sacrifice horses and pray to the Saxon gods for victory in the coming battle. Osmond's servant, the spirit Grimbald, arrives and says he has persuaded six Saxons to offer themselves as a human sacrifice. He also admits he has lost control of the other spirit, Philidel, \"a puleing Sprite\" who \"Sighs when he should plunge a Soul in Sulphur,/As with Compassion touched of foolish man.\" Philidel was supposed to have drawn up the vapours from the marsh and blown them in the face of the Christian soldiers but when he saw the crosses on their banners, he refused to carry out this task. Osmond says he will punish Philidel later.\n\nThe sacrifice scene:\n\n\"Scene 3: \"A battle supposed to be given behind the Scenes, with Drums, Trumpets, and military Shouts and Excursions.\"\"\n\nThe Britons sing a song of triumph as the Saxons flee the battlefield:\n\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nThe tender-hearted Philidel pities those soldiers who have lost their lives in the battle. Merlin arrives in his chariot and orders Philidel to tell him who he is. Philidel explains he is a spirit of the air and one of the fallen angels, but he has repented. He deserts Osmond and joins Merlin. Philidel tells Merlin that Grimbald is planning to deceive the victorious Britons by leading them to drown in rivers or fall off cliffs. Merlin leaves Philidel his band of spirits to save the Britons from this trap. Grimbald arrives disguised as a shepherd guiding Arthur and his men. Philidel and his spirits and Grimbald and his spirits compete to win Arthur's trust:\nGrimbald admits defeat, vows revenge on Philidel and vanishes.\n\n\"Scene 2: A pavilion\"\n\nEmmeline and her maid Matilda await news of the battle. To pass the time, a \"Crew of Kentish Lads and Lasses\" entertain them with songs and dances:\n\n\nOswald and his comrade Guillamar stray from the battlefield, chance upon the pavilion and kidnap Emmeline and Matilda.\n\n\"Scene 3\"\n\nA group of Britons continue the battle.\n\n\"Scene 4\"\n\nArthur holds a parley with Oswald and begs him to return Emmeline, offering him land from the River Medway to the Severn, but Oswald refuses to relinquish her.\n\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nArthur and his men attack Oswald's castle but Osmond's magic defeats them. Osmond has conjured a \"Magick Wood\" which bars access to the castle. Merlin promises to help Arthur reach Emmeline and restore her sight with potion in a vial.\n\n\"Scene 2: A deep wood\"\n\nGrimbald catches Philidel as he scouts the enchanted wood for Merlin. Philidel pretends to submit but secretly casts a spell on Grimbald which renders him powerless to move. Merlin asks Philidel to guide Arthur through the wood and gives him the vial, which the spirit uses to rid Emmeline of her blindness. Emmeline is amazed at the new world before her eyes. Merlin's spells also allow Arthur and Emmeline to meet for a brief moment, but Emmeline will not be free until the enchanted wood is destroyed. Osmond enters, intent on seducing Emmeline for himself, having drugged his master Oswald.\n\nOsmond tries to win Emmeline over by showing her a masque acted by spirits. He conjures up a vision of \"Yzeland\" and \"farthest Thule\".\n\n\nThe masque fails to persuade Emmeline and Osmond resorts to force but the captive Grimbald's shouts interrupt him. Osmond goes to free him, promising Emmeline he will be back.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nThe freed Grimbald warns Osmond that Arthur is approaching the enchanted wood, where Merlin has undone his spells. Osmond decides to replace the threatening spells with seductive ones.\n\n\"Scene 2: Scene of the Wood continues\"\n\nMerlin leaves Arthur at the entrance to the wood with the spirit Philidel as his guide. Philidel has a wand which will banish all magical deception. Arthur hears seductive music from two Sirens bathing in a stream.\n\nThough tempted, Arthur realises it is an illusion and presses on. Next, \"Nymphs and Sylvans\" emerge from the trees singing and dancing.\n\nAgain, Arthur rejects them and begins the task of destroying the wood. When he chops a tree with his sword, blood pours out of it and the voice of Emmeline cries out in pain. It convinces Arthur that it is Emmeline, who has been turned into a tree by Osmond, and Arthur is just about to embrace the tree when Philidel reveals it is really a trick by Grimbald. Philidel captures Grimbald and Arthur cuts down the tree, dispelling the enchantment from the wood and freeing the way to Oswald's castle. Philidel drags off Grimbald in chains.\n\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nNow his magic has been destroyed, Osmond is terrified of the approaching Arthur. He decides he must persuade Oswald to fight for him.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nArthur and the Britons are preparing to storm the castle when Oswald comes out and challenges his rival to single combat for the hand of Emmeline and the crown. They fight and Arthur disarms Oswald. Arthur spares his life but tells Oswald he and his Saxons must return to Germany because the Britons \"brook no Foreign Power/ To Lord it in a Land, Sacred to Freedom.\" Osmond is cast into a dungeon with Grimbald. Arthur is reunited with Emmeline and the work ends with a celebratory masque.\n\nThe final masque:\nMerlin conjures a vision of the ocean around Britain. The Four Winds create a storm which is calmed by Aeolus:\nallowing Britannia to rise from the waves on an island with fishermen at her feet.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

{"id": "2325810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325810", "title": "Anno 1602", "text": "Anno 1602\n\nAnno 1602: Creation of a New World, entitled 1602 A.D. in North America, is a 1998 construction and management video game developed by Max Design and published by Sunflowers Interactive. Set in the early modern period, it requires the player to build colonies on small islands and manage resources, exploration, diplomacy and trade. The game design is noteworthy for its attempt to implement a 'progressive' artificial intelligence, meaning that the pace of the game changes in response to how quickly players act.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" was a commercial blockbuster that attracted buyers outside the usual demographic of German computer games, including a significant percentage of female customers. It was the German market's best-selling computer game of 1998, and remained the region's highest seller of all time by 2003, with over 1.7 million units sold in German-speaking countries. The game was less successful in international markets, but ultimately sold above 2.7 million copies worldwide by 2004. \"Anno 1602\" began the \"Anno\" series, which led to the sequels \"Anno 1503\", \"Anno 1701\", \"Anno 1404\", \"Anno 2070\", \"Anno 2205\" and \"Anno 1800\".\n\n\"Anno 1602\" aims to be a mix of simulation and strategy gaming, giving players the chance to create a realistic and lively world, modeling it to their liking. The ultimate goal of the game is to discover chains of islands, settle them, develop on them, and then trade with other players. Players can also trade with their own colonies, and various neutral CPU controlled players such as native tribesmen. Even though the game focuses heavily on an economic standpoint, on various occasions the player will be forced (or will bring it upon others) to defend their islands against possible enemies.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" is a colony building and trading simulation. The player controls an unnamed European nation in 1602 AD that is looking to expand their power into the New World. As the game starts, the player will need to find a nearby island, colonize it, and start building up an economy. The US release contains all 6 scenarios (in addition to the tutorial and training game) that were included in the original European release, as well as 9 new scenarios, along with a \"free play role\".\n\nIn \"Anno 1602\", the player can choose to play out one of the game's many scenarios or engage in a free form game. The game also features online and network play with up to 4 other players simultaneously. Because the network play is less sophisticated than that of modern games, lags and disconnections often occur. Despite this, \"Anno 1602\" is still occasionally played by small groups of LAN PC gamers, or by players over the internet. The game is also playable via null modem connection.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" is designed to be as nationalistically neutral as possible. After entering a character name, the player is asked to pick one of four different colored banners to represent their country. The absence of different civilizations with different characteristics contrasts with other games such as \"The Settlers\", and \"Age of Empires\".\n\nUnlike other games where technology plays a major role in one player defeating another, \"Anno 1602\" instead makes technology upgrades more relevant in inner-colony affairs. Instead of buying upgrades to ships to perform better in huge naval battles, it is often the case that upgrades are made so that the ships can carry more cargo, and therefore make the colony more money. The majority of the buildings in the game also can / must be technologically upgraded throughout the game to please the colony's citizens, which produces more cash for the colony, with which the player can continue upgrading their nation and expand to other islands.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" is about discovery. As the colony grows and spreads, the player gains access to more and more building types and citizens construct bigger and more impressive housing for themselves. The player is required to reach a certain population level before access is gained to weapons factories. Once the player has the factories, a large number of buildings are needed to produce weapons, and additional buildings to construct units. After the buildings are constructed, the player must pay a constant flow of money to keep each building running. This \"line of production\", though difficult, has been incorporated into newer games such as \"Stronghold\".\n\n\"Anno 1602\" allows for the creation of user-made maps, using the Scenario Builder. This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities. This, along with instant \"Random Maps\", keeps many players coming back to \"Anno 1602\".\n\nNot all versions of \"Anno 1602\" shipped with a map editor, therefore several fan-made editors were created.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" was conceived in April 1996 at Max Design, a Schladming-based game developer founded in 1991. Following a period of financial turmoil in which the company neared bankruptcy, the team began \"Anno\" as a spiritual sequel to its earlier title \"1869 – Hart am Wind!\", a competitor of \"The Patrician\". The team at Max Design numbered only four members: designer Wilfried Reiter, brothers Martin and Albert Lasser and artist Ulli Koller. \"Anno 1602\"s design occurred gradually. From December 17 till December 22, 2018, the game was given away to Uplay users for free on PC.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" was a commercial hit. In the German market, the title debuted in first place on Media Control's computer game sales rankings for the second half of April 1998, and held the position after six weeks on the charts. By that time, it had sold 200,000 units. \"Der Spiegel\" reported in June that this performance made \"Anno\" the title with \"the best chance to become the German number one this year\". The game subsequently received a \"Platinum\" award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), for sales of at least 200,000 units throughout the German-speaking world: Germany, Austria and Switzerland. \"Anno 1602\"s streak at #1 ended in the latter half of June when \"\" captured the spot, which it maintained for 16 weeks. Sunflowers' game remained at second on the Media Control charts for the last two weeks of June, July, August and September.\nAccruing 360,000 domestic sales by September, \"Anno 1602\" was the German market's best-selling game during the first nine months of 1998. \"PC Games\" Petra Maueröder wrote that Germany was \"plagued by the \"Anno 1602\" fever\" in the half-year following its release, while Max Falkenstern likened it to a \"pandemic\" in \"\". The game's sales for the period resulted in a 300% increase in Sunflowers' year-over-year revenue, to DM 20 million. Remarking on this success at the time, Eva Müller and Hans-Peter Canibol of \"Focus\" noted that Sunflowers had become \"one of the few German companies that [has] asserted itself in the American-dominated [computer game] market.\" Sunflowers forecast sales of 600,000 units for \"Anno\" by the end of 1998, based on its performance earlier in the year. The game claimed second on Media Control's charts during the last two weeks of October, below \"Need for Speed 3\", and then dropped to #3 for the second halves of November and December. Sales had risen to 400,000 units after six months of availability, and \"Anno 1602\" ultimately became the German market's best-selling computer game of 1998. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \"Gold\" prize for revenues above €15 million in the European Union during the previous year.\n\nThe high sales of \"Anno 1602\" in German-speaking countries derived partly from Sunflowers' copy protection scheme, according to \"PC Games\". Although the game launched as a direct competitor of \"StarCraft\", it significantly outsold that title in the region by the end of 1998, despite the latter's success worldwide. Petra Maueröder reported that, because \"StarCraft\" had shipped without copy protection in Germany, its piracy rate there reached nine illegal copies for every legal version sold. Conversely, Sunflowers attempted to combat pirates by making \"Anno 1602\" \"one of the first games\" printed on extended-capacity CD-ROMs, a writer for \"PC Games\" noted. These exceeded the storage limits of standard discs, which made \"Anno 1602\" incompatible with most consumer CD-Rs and burners of the time. The effort resulted in faulty disc shipments, a common issue for extended-capacity CDs, but it was ultimately judged by \"PC Games\" as \"a complete success, despite the availability of cracks.\"\n\n\"Anno 1602\" became one of the construction and management simulations that \"dominated the German sales charts for years\", according to \"Der Spiegel\"s Frank Patalong. By the end of January 1999, it had spent 38 weeks on Media Control's bestsellers list, ranking fourth that month. It soon became the first computer game to earn the VUD's \"Double-Platinum\" award, for 400,000 sales in German-speaking countries. By May, \"Anno 1602\" had sold through 600,000 units in the German market and—together with its expansion pack \"New Islands, New Adventures\"—one million copies across Europe. \"PC Games\" declared it the German-speaking world's most successful computer title from April 1998–July 1999, and, as of September, the region's biggest computer game hit of all time. It continued to appear in Media Control's sales rankings through the latter half of September 1999, when it charted in 26th place and secured its 70th consecutive week in the top rankings. Sales surpassed 650,000 units by October; \"New Islands\" had sold above 200,000 units by that date.\n\nIn the second part of October 1999, \"Anno 1602: Königs-Edition\" debuted at #4 on Media Control's charts. Announced in August for a fall launch, the SKU bundled \"Anno 1602\" and \"New Islands\" with unique bonus missions. The new version had spent 10 weeks in the rankings by the end of 1999, including a seventh-place finish for December. It continued to chart in Media Control's top 10 during 2000: the \"Königs-Edition\" reached #4 for the month of February and remained at 11th by August, having spent 12 months in the top 30. The following month, Infogrames Germany announced \"Anno\"s re-release as a \"Soft Price\" budget title, with its cost reduced to DM 40. The Soft Price edition took #6 in October and November 2000 on Media Control's charts for budget-priced games, and stayed in the top 15 for February and March 2001. \"Anno 1602\"s sales had risen above one million units in German-speaking countries by September 2000, and by April 2001 had surpassed 1.5 million units worldwide. Global sales increased to 1.7 million copies by October 2001, of which the \"Königs-Edition\" accounted for 170,000 units. The SKU was re-released that month under Electronic Arts' \"Classics\" label, again at a budget price, and it debuted in 11th place on Media Control's budget charts for November.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" had sold 2 million times by December 2001, including \"well over a million\" in the German-speaking world, according to Sunflowers. That month, the company revealed a new partnership with ak tronic, a rack jobber known for its budget-priced \"Pyramid\" displays in German stores. This type of budget line formed a significant part of the German game market, and journalist later called it a key to \"Anno\"s high lifetime sales. Under the agreement, ak tronic included budget-priced (€10) copies of \"Anno 1602\" in its Pyramid displays, starting with a shipment of 250,000 units in January 2002. Peter Schroer of ak tronic forecast 500,000 sales for \"Anno\"s Pyramid edition by the end of 2002. In the German market, the new release proceeded to sell 50,000 units in its first month on shelves, and it rose to #1 on Media Control's budget charts in February 2002. Taking second in March, it finished with top-10 placements in June, July, August, September, October and November. Media Control named it Germany's best-selling budget computer game (€28<) of the year, while its sequel \"Anno 1503\" took first place for 2002 among full-price titles.\n\nBy April 2003, \"Anno 1602\" remained the German market's biggest-ever computer game hit. Its Pyramid edition secured top-10 positions on Media Control's budget charts for the first three months of that year. After an 11th-place finish in June 2003, the Pyramid edition had spent 17 consecutive months in Media Control's top 20. \"Anno 1602\"s global sales climbed to 2.7 million units by September 2004. In 2007, Jörg Langer wrote that the Pyramid edition alone had contributed roughly 750,000 sales to the game's lifetime total.\n\nAccording to Heiko Klinge of \"GameStar\", a significant number of \"Anno\" buyers fell outside the standard demographic for German computer games. By 2000, Sunflowers noted a high \"proportion of inexperienced players and women in the \"Anno\" fan base\", which it attributed to the game's design goal of \"play without stress\". Klinge echoed this theory. \"Der Spiegel\" similarly reported \"Anno\"s wide appeal among both casual and hardcore players, and the magazine's Carsten Görig argued that \"many can agree on \"Anno\" because \"Anno\" is a phenomenon.\" \"Der Spiegel\"s Richard Löwenstein cited \"Anno\" as an early computer game to draw female players; he claimed in 2002 that approximately 25% of its buyers were women. In 2011, Klinge likewise called the game's number of female players \"an absolute novelty\" before \"The Sims\", and reported that women made up nearly 50% of \"Anno 1602\" customers.\n\n\"Anno 1602\"s success was primarily contained to the German market; \"GameStar\" reported that, like \"Gothic\", it failed to make an \"international breakthrough\". Sunflowers president Adi Boiko remarked, \"When we wanted to distribute \"Anno 1602\" internationally, we encountered enormous prejudices that a game from Germany couldn't be anything special.\" Of \"Anno 1602\"s 2.5 million worldwide sales by late 2002, the German market accounted for 1.7 million. The title's limited crossover in other markets was common among German games, particularly in \"Anno\"s genre of construction and management, despite the outsize popularity of such titles in the German-speaking world. \"Der Spiegel\"s Frank Patalong argued that games like \"Anno 1602\" were a \"specifically German phenomenon: nowhere else in the world are [these] simulations as successful as here at home.\" Stefan Schmitt of \"Der Spiegel\" and Jochen Gebauer of \"\" wrote that such games were especially disliked in the United States, and a writer for \"GameStar\" stated that no \"Anno\" title had been a hit in that market by mid-2006. Boiko noted that it was \"very difficult for us to find a good distributor\" in the United States, which led to \"Anno 1602\"s delayed release and lack of marketing there. However, he was pleased with its 200,000 sales in the country by early 2002. This number rose to 250,000 units by that November.\n\n\"Anno 1602\" began the \"Anno\" series. In 2018, \"PC Games\" named it one of the most influential games ever released.\n\n\n"}

Examples include locating vehicles, managing worker activity, scheduling and dispatching work, ensuring driver safety, and integrating the management of such activities with inventory, billing, accounting and other back-office systems. FSM most commonly refers to companies who need to manage installation, service or repairs of systems or equipment. It can also refer to software and cloud-based platforms that aid in field service management.\n\nField service management is used to manage resources in several industries. \n\nField service management must meet certain requirements: \n\nFSM software has significantly evolved in the past 10 years, however the market for FSM software remains fragmented. The software can be deployed both on-premises or as a hosted or cloud-based system. Typically, FSM software is integrated with backend systems such as service management, billing, accounting, parts inventory and other HR systems. \n\nThe large majority of FSM companies are fee-for-service and offer differing features and functionality that vary from one company to the next. Whereas one company will provide most, if not all, of the desirable features in field service management, another will be missing one or up to several functions. Pricing is dependent on several factors: a company's size, business needs, number of users, carrier selection and planned data usage. Some popular fee structures are pay-per-franchise, pay-per-use/administrators, and pay-per-field technician/employee. Costs can range from $20.00 per month for an unbundled solution that does not include carrier data charges to upwards of $200.00. It is not uncommon, although not always the case, for there to be other fees incurred with the use of the FSM platform; namely, fees for software, extra technical support, and additional training.\n\nFor the enterprise market, Gartner estimates that market penetration for field service applications has reached 25% of the addressable market. Software sales in the FSM market can only be approximated. Gartner research puts the revenue for packaged field service dispatch and workforce management software applications, not including service revenue, at approximately $1.2 billion in 2012, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.7%.\n\nCompanies are using mobile computing to improve communication with the field, increase productivity, streamline work processes, and enhance customer service and loyalty. Field service software can be used for scheduling and routing optimization, automated vehicle location, remote vehicle diagnostics, driver logs and hours-of-service tracking, inventory management, field worker management and driver safety.

The game is based around a realistic simulation of the Block 50/52 F-16 Fighting Falcon in a series of missions in the Balkans.\n\nThe game engine is based on the source code of the original 1998 \"Falcon 4.0\" from MicroProse, and consists largely of a collection of improvements from the official patches and extensive \"Falcon\" modding community. \"Allied Force\" also introduced several major new features and significant improvements in realism and stability.\n\n\"Falcon 4.0: Allied Force\" is a detailed simulation; like other simulations, it may take the user some time to become proficient and familiar with all of its features. \"Allied Force\" comes with a 716-page manual, which can act as a \"quick start\" guide to flying a military jet. The game focuses primarily on learning to fly and fight in an F-16, yet also allows the user to manage all the ground and air assets in a campaign if they wish, or control and vector fighters as part of an E-3 AWACS squadron.\n\nThe simulation allows the user to control the level of realism: the player can either set the realism settings on maximum, or enable options such as invulnerability and unlimited ammo; this may make the game easier for newcomers or players who wish to have a less realistic experience.\n\nA player that enables many of the realism settings must work with his wingmen, friendly assets such as AWACS, JSTARS, airborne tankers, forward air controllers, and other friendly aircraft if he wishes to be successful.\n\nThe emphasis of the simulation's air combat is the use of beyond-visual-range missiles to destroy opponents many miles away, while maintaining the pilot's situational awareness. The player must therefore learn not only offensive tactics, but an ability to detect and counter a threat such as an incoming enemy missile. Due to the nature of beyond-visual-range fighting, within-visual-range (dogfighting) is rare in the game's campaign modes. There is, however, an \"Instant Action\" mode, where dogfighting may occur.\n\nThe game provides simulations and training missions for some common situations, such as: landing during an engine flameout, basic fighter maneuvers (BFM), navigation using on-board instruments, avoiding surface to air missiles (SAMs), and deploying various weapons against air and ground targets.\n\nDogfight mode allows the player to set up a situation in which dogfighting will take place. This is a single player or multiplayer mode. In multiplayer, two or more humans can combat one another over the Internet.\n\nTactical Engagement mode is where a player can build a mission with a number of customizable parameters, including the target, payload, enemy presence, customization of aircraft, etc. This is also a multiplayer mode.\n\nThe game includes a useful database including most ground vehicles, aircraft, weapons, and ships that are in the simulation. Each entry is presented with an image and text information on the subject.\n\nIn game, players can record parts of their flight which can then be reviewed later in the ACMI. Here the fight from any angle or viewpoint can be played, paused, rewound or forwarded through. Also information can be shown on the screen such as turn rate, speed, turn radius, and altitude to help a pilot ascertain where they may be going wrong.\n\n\"Falcon 4.0: Allied Force\" has a dynamic and customizable campaign. Once a player starts a campaign, the game will begin executing the campaign in real time. Thus, even when the player is not flying, other aircraft, ships, armies and anti-aircraft sites may still be fighting. This is represented to the player in a 2D map where objects can be displayed or hidden. The player can accelerate the campaign to 64X normal time, set up new flights, select weapons load-outs, view target areas and map waypoints before the time arrives for the next mission.\n\nThe campaign modes take place in the virtual battlefields of Korea and the Balkans, which can be configured based on historical data from 1999, 2005 or from how the area might appear in 2010. Each timeline will automatically change the type of weapons and sophistication of aircraft used in the campaign. The simulation includes the original Korean peninsula battlefield between North and South Korea. Here NATO forces support South Korea in various scenarios that can also involve China supporting North Korea. The campaigns can also be played online.\n\nThe game has been patched a number of times since its initial release. The final cumulative update is version 1.0.13.\n\nAlthough the release of \"Falcon 4.0: Allied Force\" was meant to raise funds for a new version, dubbed \"Falcon 5\" to be developed, nothing eventuated from it. In 2005, Lead Pursuit was deregistered as a company. Further development on the original \"Falcon 4.0\" source code has continued under two development communities: FreeFalcon and Benchmark Sims (BMS). FreeFalcon ended their efforts in 2013. BMS have continued development.\n\n\"Allied Force\" was a finalist for \"PC Gamer\"s \"Best Simulation 2005\" award, which ultimately went to \"Silent Hunter III\".\n"}
{"id": "2325953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2325953", "title": "Quantum network", "text": "Quantum network\n\nQuantum networks form an important element of quantum computing and quantum communication systems. Quantum networks facilitate the transmission of information in the form of quantum bits, also called qubits, between physically separated quantum processors. A quantum processor is a small quantum computer being able to perform quantum logic gates on a certain number of qubits. Quantum networks work in a similar way to classical networks. The main difference is that quantum networking, like quantum computing, is better at solving certain problems, such as modeling quantum systems.\n\nNetworked quantum computing or distributed quantum computing works by linking multiple quantum processors through a quantum network by sending qubits in-between them. Doing this creates a quantum computing cluster and therefore creates more computing potential. Less powerful computers can be linked in this way to create one more powerful processor. This is analogous to connecting several classical computers to form a computer cluster in classical computing. Like classical computing this system is scale-able by adding more and more quantum computers to the network. Currently quantum processors are only separated by short distances.\n\nIn the realm of quantum communication, one wants to send qubits from one quantum processor to another over long distances. This way local quantum networks can be intra connected into a quantum internet. A quantum internet supports many applications, which derive their power from the fact that by creating quantum entangled qubits, information can be transmitted between the remote quantum processors. Most applications of a quantum internet require only very modest quantum processors. For most quantum internet protocols, such as quantum key distribution in quantum cryptography, it is sufficient if these processors are capable of preparing and measuring only a single qubit at a time. This is in contrast to quantum computing where interesting applications can only be realized if the (combined) quantum processors can easily simulate more qubits than a classical computer (around 60). Quantum internet applications require only small quantum processors, often just a single qubit, because quantum entanglement can already be realized between just two qubits. A simulation of an entangled quantum system on a classical computer can not simultaneously provide the same security and speed.\n\nThe basic structure of a quantum network and more generally a quantum internet is analogous to a classical network. First, we have end nodes on which applications are ultimately run. These end nodes are quantum processors of at least one qubit. Some applications of a quantum internet require quantum processors of several qubits as well as a quantum memory at the end nodes.\n\nSecond, to transport qubits from one node to another, we need communication lines. For the purpose of quantum communication, standard telecom fibers can be used. For networked quantum computing, in which quantum processors are linked at short distances, different wavelengths are chosen depending on the exact hardware platform of the quantum processor.\n\nThird, to make maximum use of communication infrastructure, one requires optical switches capable of delivering qubits to the intended quantum processor. These switches need to preserve quantum coherence, which makes them more challenging to realize than standard optical switches.\n\nFinally, one requires a quantum repeater to transport qubits over long distances. Repeaters appear in-between end nodes. Since qubits cannot be copied, classical signal amplification is not possible. By necessity, a quantum repeater works in a fundamentally different way than a classical repeater.\n\nEnd nodes can both receive and emit information. Telecommunication lasers and parametric down-conversion combined with photodetectors can be used for quantum key distribution. In this case, the end nodes can in many cases be very simple devices consisting only of beamsplitters and photodetectors.\n\nHowever, for many protocols more sophisticated end nodes are desirable. These systems provide advanced processing capabilities and can also be used as quantum repeaters. Their chief advantage is that they can store and retransmit quantum information without disrupting the underlying quantum state. The quantum state being stored can either be the relative spin of an electron in a magnetic field or the energy state of an electron. They can also perform quantum logic gates.\n\nOne way of realizing such end nodes is by using color centers in diamond, such as the nitrogen-vacancy center. This system forms a small quantum processor featuring several qubits. NV centers can be utilized at room temperatures. Small scale quantum algorithms and quantum error correction has already been demonstrated in this system, as well as the ability to entangle two remote quantum processors, and perform deterministic quantum teleportation.\n\nAnother possible platform are quantum processors based on Ion traps, which utilize radio-frequency magnetic fields and lasers. In a multispecies trapped-ion node network, photons entangled with a parent atom are used to entangle different nodes. Also, cavity quantum electrodynamics (Cavity QED) is one possible method of doing this. In Cavity QED, photonic quantum states can be transferred to and from atomic quantum states stored in single atoms contained in optical cavities. This allows for the transfer of quantum states between single atoms using optical fiber in addition to the creation of remote entanglement between distant atoms.\n\nOver long distances, the primary method of operating quantum networks is to use optical networks and photon-based qubits. This is due to optical networks having a reduced chance of decoherence. Optical networks have the advantage of being able to re-use existing optical fiber. Alternately, free space networks can be implemented that transmit quantum information through the atmosphere or through a vacuum.\n\nOptical networks using existing telecommunication fiber can be implemented using hardware similar to existing telecommunication equipment. This fiber can be either single-mode or multi-mode, with multi-mode allowing for more precise communication. At the sender, a \"single photon\" source can be created by heavily attenuating a standard telecommunication laser such that the mean number of photons per pulse is less than 1. For receiving, an avalanche photodetector can be used. Various methods of phase or polarization control can be used such as interferometers and beam splitters. In the case of entanglement based protocols, entangled photons can be generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In both cases, the telecom fiber can be multiplexed to send non-quantum timing and control signals.\n\nFree space quantum networks operate similar to fiber optic networks but rely on line of sight between the communicating parties instead of using a fiber optic connection. Free space networks can typically support higher transmission rates than fiber optic networks and do not have to account for polarization scrambling caused by optical fiber. However, over long distances, free space communication is subject to an increased chance of environmental disturbance on the photons.\n\nImportantly, free space communication is also possible from a satellite to the ground. A quantum satellite capable of entanglement distribution over a distance of 1,203 km has been demonstrated. The experimental exchange of single photons from a global navigation satellite system at a slant distance of 20,000 km has also been reported. These satellites can play an important role in linking smaller ground-based networks over larger distances.\n\nLong distance communication is hindered by the effects of signal loss and decoherence inherent to most transport mediums such as optical fiber. In classical communication, amplifiers can be used to boost the signal during transmission, but in a quantum network amplifiers cannot be used since qubits cannot be copied – known as the no-cloning theorem. That is, to implement an amplifier, the complete state of the flying qubit would need to be determined, something which is both unwanted and impossible.\n\nAn intermediary step which allows the testing of communication infrastructure are trusted repeaters. Importantly, a trusted repeater cannot be used to transmit qubits over long distances. Instead, a trusted repeater can only be used to perform quantum key distribution with the additional assumption that the repeater is trusted. Consider two end nodes A and B, and a trusted repeater R in the middle. A and R now perform quantum key distribution to generate a key formula_1. Similarly, R and B run quantum key distribution to generate a key formula_2. A and B can now obtain a key formula_3 between themselves as follows: A sends formula_3 to R encrypted with the key formula_1. R decrypts to obtain formula_3. R then re-encrypts formula_3 using the key formula_2 and sends it to B. B decrypts to obtain formula_3. A and B now share the key formula_3. The key is secure from an outside eavesdropper, but clearly the repeater R also knows formula_3. This means that any subsequent communication between A and B does not provide end to end security, but is only secure as long as A and B trust the repeater R.\n\nA true quantum repeater allows the end to end generation of quantum entanglement, and thus - by using quantum teleportation - the end to end transmission of qubits. In quantum key distribution protocols one can test for such entanglement. This means that when making encryption keys, the sender and receiver are secure even if they do not trust the quantum repeater. Any other application of a quantum internet also requires the end to end transmission of qubits, and thus a quantum repeater.\n\nQuantum repeaters allow entanglement and can be established at distant nodes without physically sending an entangled qubit the entire distance.\n\nIn this case, the quantum network consists of many short distance links of perhaps tens or hundreds of kilometers. In the simplest case of a single repeater, two pairs of entangled qubits are established: formula_12 and formula_13 located at the sender and the repeater, and a second pair formula_14 and formula_15 located at the repeater and the receiver. These initial entangled qubits can be easily created, for example through parametric down conversion, with one qubit physically transmitted to an adjacent node. At this point, the repeater can perform a bell measurement on the qubits formula_13 and formula_14 thus teleporting the quantum state of formula_13 onto formula_15. This has the effect of \"swapping\" the entanglement such that formula_12 and formula_15 are now entangled at a distance twice that of the initial entangled pairs. It can be seen that a network of such repeaters can be used linearly or in a hierarchical fashion to establish entanglement over great distances.\n\nHardware platforms suitable as end nodes above can also function as quantum repeaters. However, there are also hardware platforms specific only to the task of acting as a repeater, without the capabilities of performing quantum gates.\n\nError correction can be used in quantum repeaters. Due to technological limitations, however, the applicability is limited to very short distances as quantum error correction schemes capable of protecting qubits over long distances would require an extremely large amount of qubits and hence extremely large quantum computers.\n\nErrors in communication can be broadly classified into two types: Loss errors (due to optical fiber/environment) and operation errors (such as depolarization, dephasing etc.). While redundancy can be used to detect and correct classical errors, redundant qubits cannot be created due to the no-cloning theorem. As a result, other types of error correction must be introduced such as the Shor code or one of a number of more general and efficient codes. All of these codes work by distributing the quantum information across multiple entangled qubits so that operation errors as well as loss errors can be corrected.\n\nIn addition to quantum error correction, classical error correction can be employed by quantum networks in special cases such as quantum key distribution. In these cases, the goal of the quantum communication is to securely transmit a string of classical bits. Traditional error correction codes such as Hamming codes can be applied to the bit string before encoding and transmission on the quantum network.\n\nQuantum decoherence can occur when one qubit from a maximally entangled bell state is transmitted across a quantum network. Entanglement purification allows for the creation of nearly maximally entangled qubits from a large number of arbitrary weakly entangled qubits, and thus provides additional protection against errors. Entanglement purification (also known as Entanglement distillation) has already been demonstrated in Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.\n\nA quantum internet supports numerous applications, enabled by quantum entanglement. In general, quantum entanglement is well suited for tasks that require coordination, synchronization or privacy.\n\nExamples of such applications include quantum key distribution, clock synchronization, protocols for distributed system problems such as leader election or byzantine agreement, extending the baseline of telescopes, as well as position verification, secure identification and two-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. A quantum internet also enables secure access to a quantum computer in the cloud. Specifically, a quantum internet enables very simple quantum devices to connect to a remote quantum computer in such a way that computations can be performed there without the quantum computer finding out what this computation actually is (the input and output quantum states can not be measured without destroying the computation, but the circuit composition used for the calculation will be known).\n\nWhen it comes to communicating in any form the largest issue has always been keeping your communications private. From when couriers were used to send letters between ancient battle commanders to secure radio communications that exist today the main purpose is to ensure that what a sender sends out to the receiver reaches the receiver unmolested. This is an area in which Quantum Networks particularly excel. By applying a quantum operator that the user selects to a system of information the information can then be sent to the receiver without a chance of an eavesdropper being able to accurately be able to record the sent information without either the sender or receiver knowing. This works because if a listener tries to listen in then they will change the information in an unintended way by listening thereby tipping their hand to the people on whom they are attacking. Secondly, without the proper quantum operator to decode the information they will corrupt the sent information without being able to use it themselves.\n\nAt present, there is no network connecting quantum processors, or quantum repeaters deployed outside a lab.\n\nSeveral test networks have been deployed that are tailored to the task of quantum key distribution either at short distances (but connecting many users), or over larger distances by relying on trusted repeaters. These networks do not yet allow for the end to end transmission of qubits or the end to end creation of entanglement between far away nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hoshiarpur, one of the oldest districts of Punjab, is located in the North-east part of the Punjab state and shares common boundaries with Gurdaspur district in the north-west, Jalandhar and Kapurthala districts in south-west, Kangra and Una districts of Himachal Pradesh in the north-east. Hoshiarpur district comprises 4 sub-divisions, 10 community development blocks, 9 urban local bodies and 1417 villages. The district has an area of 3365 km. and a population of 1,586,625 persons as per census 2011.\n\nHoshiarpur along with the districts of Nawanshehar, Kapurthala and parts of Jalandhar represents one of the cultural region of Punjab called Doaba or the Bist Doab - the tract of land between two rivers namely Beas and Sutlej. The area along with \nthe Shivalik foothills on the right side of Chandigarh-Pathankot road in Hoshiarpur is submountainous and this part of the district is also known as Kandi area. The two rivers, Sutlej and Beas along with two other seasonal streams provide drainage to the region. Besides these, the Kandi region is full of seasonal streams.\n\nIt falls into two nearly equal portions of hill and plain country. Its eastern face consists of the westward slope of the Solar Singhi Hills; parallel with that ridge, a line of lower heights belonging to the Siwalik Range traverses the district from south to north, while between the two chains stretches a valley of uneven width, known as the Jaswan Dun. Its upper portion is crossed by the Sohan torrent, while the Sutlej sweeps into its lower end through a break in the hills, and flows in a southerly direction until it turns the flank of the central range, and debouches westwards upon the plains. This western plain consists of alluvial formation, with a general westerly slope owing to the deposit of silt from the mountain torrents in the sub-montane tract. The Beas has a fringe of lowland, open to moderate but not excessive inundations, and considered very fertile. A considerable area is covered by government woodlands, under the care of the forest department. Rice is largely grown, in the marshy flats along the banks of the Beas. Several religious fairs are held, at Anandpur Sahib, Dasuya, Mukerian and Chintpurni, all of which attract an enormous concourse of people. The district, owing to its proximity to the hills, possesses a comparatively cool and humid climate. Cotton fabrics are manufactured, and sugar, rice, other grains and indigo are among the exports.\n\nHoshiarpur is also known as a City of Saints. There are many Deras in this district. The District Govt. College was once a campus for Punjab University.\nit was predominantly inhabited by Gujjar and Dogars of Kashmir Region during the reign of Sikh Empire\n\nThe area of present Hoshiarpur District was also part of Indus Valley Civilization. Recent excavations at various sites in the district have revealed that the entire area near the Shivalik foothills was selected for habitation not only by the early Paleolithic man but also by those in the protohistoric and historic periods. The legends associate several places in the district with Pandavas. Dasuya is mentioned in epic of Mahabharata as the seat of Raja Virata in whose services the Pandavas remained for thirteen years during their exile. Bham, about 11 km west of Mahilpur, is said to be the place where the Pandavas passed their exile. Lasara, about 19 km north of Jaijon, also contains a stone temple stated to date back to the time of Pandavas. According to the Chinese pilgrim, Hieun Tsang, the area of Hoshiarpur was dominated by a tribe of Chandrabansi Rajputs, who maintained an independent existence for centuries before the Muhammadan conquest.\n\nThe country around Hoshiarpur formed part of the old kingdom of Katoch in Jalandhar. The state was eventually broken up, and the present district was divided between the, rajas of Datarpur and Jaswan. They retained undisturbed possession of their territories until 1759, when the rising Sikh chieftains commenced a series of encroachments upon the hill tracts. In 1815 Maharaja Ranjit Singh, forced the ruler of Jaswan to resign his territories in exchange for an estate on feudal tenure; three years later the raja of Datarpur met with similar treatment. By the close of the year 1818 the whole country from the Sutlej to the Beas had come under the government of Lahore, and after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846 passed to the British government. The deposed rajas of Datarpur and Jaswan received cash pensions from the new rulers, but expressed bitter disappointment at not being restored to their former sovereign position. Accordingly, the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, in 1848 found the disaffected chieftains ready for rebellion. They organized a revolt, but the two rajas and the other ringleaders were captured, and their estates confiscated. Hoshiarpur is an ancient centre of Hindu epics and culture itself. In Bajwara (4 km east on Una Road from the present city) ruins of an ancient culture can still be found. Mythologically, Teh Dasuya of this district is estimated to be King Virat's kingdom where Pandavas spent their one-year exile.\n\nHoshiarpur is also highly popular for old Astrological facts where it is said to be that old documents where past, present and future birth of every person is written in detail, are safely kept at this place. Lots of people from all over the world visit Hoshiarpur to find out about their past, present and future in every birth they have or had taken in the past.\n\nAmong the numerous ancient cultural centers in Hoshiarpur was town Jaijon. Said to be Founded by Jaijjat rishi around 11th century at the Shivalik foothills, Jaijon was a flourishing trade centre. It was also known as a centre for oriental studies. Noted scholars and exponents of Sanskrit, Astrology, Ayurveda and music visited this place for meeting. Music composers Pandit Husan Lal and Bhagat Ram and noted Pakistani poet Tufail Hoshiarpuri belonged to the same place.\n\nThe late Ayurveda scholar Pandit Govind Ram Vatsyayan and the late Sanskrit laureate Acharya Vishwanath belonged to Jaijon.\nOver the years when Chandigarh came into existence Jaijon lost its glory and now it is a sleepy town on the border of Punjab and Himachal in the foothills of Shivaliks.\n\nMahilpur is an ancient village on the feet of Shivalik which was visited by Chinese Hyunshang who wrote this village as Sri Mahipalpur in his notes. Now Mahilpur has become a town.\n\nSadarpur is located near Garhshankar in the Shivalik Valley. It is a small town.\n\nJaijon still has a small old railway station from the British Era.\n\nAt present, Hoshiarpur has an area of 3198.2 km².\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Hoshiarpur district has a population of 1,586,625, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Idaho. This gives it a ranking of 31st in India (out of a total of 640). \nThe district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 17.95%. Hoshiarpur has a sex ratio of 961 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 85.40%.\n\nScheduled Castes population in the district is 34 percent of the total population. The proportion of Scheduled Castes population in Hoshiarpur district is higher than the state’s Schedule Castes population (32 percent) and is ranked at the 5th position \namong all the districts. It may be mentioned that proportion of the Scheduled Castes population varies among blocks of Hoshiarpur district. In four blocks the population of Scheduled Castes is more than 40 percent. Two blocks namely, Hoshiarpur-I and Hoshiarpur-II have 48 percent Scheduled Castes population. In Mahilpur block the proportion of Scheduled Castes population is 44 percent and in Bhunga block it is 41 percent while in the remaining blocks the proportion of Scheduled Castes population is less than 40 percent.

It has been the icon of Finnish corporation Nokia since the 1990s, becoming the first identifiable musical ringtone on a mobile phone.\n\nIn 1992, Nokia used Francisco Tárrega's \"Gran Vals\" as the background music in a commercial for the Nokia 1011. The excerpt of \"Gran Vals\" used includes the phrase that would later be used for the Nokia tune ringtone.\n\nIn 1993 , then Executive Vice President of Nokia, brought the whole \"Gran Vals\" to Lauri Kivinen (then Head of Corporate Communications) and together they selected the excerpt that became \"Nokia tune\". The excerpt is taken from measures (bars) 13–16 of the piece.\n\nThe Nokia tune first appeared on the Nokia 2110 released in 1994, under the name ringtone \"Type 7\", showing that it was just one of the normal ringtones. The tune's original name varied in the ringtone list, being listed as \"Type 13\" on some phones, or \"Type 5\" on others. In December 1997 with the introduction of the Nokia 6110, ringtones were each given a specific name, and the tune received the name \"Grande valse\". Some later Nokia phones (e.g. some 3310s) still used Type 7 as the name of the Nokia tune. In 1999, \"Grande valse\" was renamed as \"Nokia tune\" and effectively became Nokia's flagship ringtone.\n\nIn December 1999, Jimmy Cauty, formerly of The KLF, and Guy Pratt released the mobile telephone-themed novelty-pop record \"I Wanna 1-2-1 With You\" under the name Solid Gold Chartbusters which heavily samples the theme. It was released as competition for the UK Christmas number one single but only got to number 62. The release of this song prevented the Super Furry Animals from releasing their song \"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\" from the album \"Guerrilla\" as a single, on the grounds that it was also based on a mobile phone theme.\n\nIt has since been evolved into many different types with the evolution of mobile phones' audio capabilities:\n\n\nThere are a few more versions of the Nokia tune that were uniquely used on one model, such as those on Nokia 9110, Nokia 2300 (produced by its unique polyphonic sound output), Nokia 8800 (a slowed down piano recording), and the Nokia 8800 Sirocco (a slow guitar version composed by Brian Eno). An official dubstep version was made in 2011 as part of Nokia's crowdsourcing campaign the Nokia Tune Remake competition; this is available alongside the traditional Nokia tune on certain models of that time.\n\nThe tune was prominently featured in a recurring sketch on the British hidden camera/practical joke reality television series \"Trigger Happy TV\".\n\nIn 2009, it was reported that the tune was heard worldwide an estimated 1.8 billion times per day, about 20,000 times per second.\n\nThe tune has been registered by Nokia as a sound trademark in some countries.\n\nCanadian pianist Marc-André Hamelin wrote a short composition entitled \"Valse Irritation d'après Nokia\" based on the tune.\n\nThe Indonesian rock band The Changcuters included the segment of the Nokia tune on their song \"Parampampam\". The song was included on their 2011 album \"Tugas Akhir\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2326001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326001", "title": "The World Is Not Enough (song)", "text": "The World Is Not Enough (song)\n\n\"The World Is Not Enough\" is the theme song from the eponymous 1999 James Bond film, performed by American-Scottish alternative rock band Garbage. The song was written by composer David Arnold (who also scored the film) and lyricist Don Black, previously responsible for four other Bond songs, and was produced by Garbage and Arnold. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was composed in the style of the series' title songs, in contrast with the post-modern production and genre-hopping of Garbage's first two albums. The group recorded most of \"The World Is Not Enough\" while touring Europe in support of their album \"Version 2.0\", telephoning Arnold as he recorded the orchestral backing in London before travelling to England. Garbage later finished recording and mixing the song at Armoury Studios in Canada. The lyrics reflect the film's plot (told from the viewpoint of antagonist Elektra King), with themes of world domination and seduction.\n\nThe song and its accompanying soundtrack were released internationally by Radioactive Records when the film premiered worldwide at the end of November 1999. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was praised by reviewers; it reached the top forty of ten singles charts and the top ten of four. It was included on the James Bond compilation \"The Best of Bond... James Bond\" and Garbage's greatest hits album, \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\nIn September 1998 Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, owners of Eon Productions and long-time producers of James Bond films, chose David Arnold to compose the score for the nineteenth Bond movie (scheduled for release in November of the following year). Arnold composed the score for \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", the previous film, and oversaw the recording of \"\" (an album of cover versions recorded by contemporary artists including Pulp, Aimee Mann and David McAlmont). Arnold and the film's production team wanted an early rough draft of the song so elements of its melody could be incorporated into the main score. Director Michael Apted thought the use of \"Nobody Does It Better\" as a love theme throughout \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" very effective, and he wanted Arnold to use that as a reference point.\n\nArnold wanted a theme song marrying the \"classic Bond sound\" with the electronica that would influence most of his score. An orchestra would be required as audiences expect traditional elements in a Bond film, and without them \"The World Is Not Enough\" would be seen as a generic action movie. Getting the balance right might be a \"poisoned chalice\", since the results could sound too much or too little like a Bond theme. Arnold collaborated with lyricist Don Black on the song. Black, with 30 years of experience writing Bond themes, wrote the lyrics to Tom Jones's \"Thunderball\", Shirley Bassey's \"Diamonds Are Forever\", Lulu's \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and k.d. lang's closing credits theme, \"Surrender\", from \"Tomorrow Never Dies\". Arnold and Black met several times to discuss lyrics for \"The World Is Not Enough\", also collaborating by phone, fax and email. According to Arnold, he \"strung some la-las together, and all of a sudden the [song] came to life\". By the end of 1998 he and Black finished the music and lyrics, except for the bridge (a contrasting section of about eight bars).\n\nThe lyrics are from the viewpoint of Elektra King, the Bond girl revealed as the mastermind of the villainous scheme. Its underlying themes are seduction and domination, described by Arnold as \"a steel fist in a velvet glove. It beckons you in with its crooked finger.\" Black added that although the lyrics reflected the film's plot, they were \"of course all about world domination\" and \"a lot more personal and intense\", evoking a \"ballady and dramatic\" mood. A line of dialogue from the film, \"There's no point in living if you can't feel alive,\" was included in the lyrics.\n\nThat month Arnold offered the theme to Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson, who was very enthusiastic; Arnold said he \"never heard someone screaming down the phone\". A week later he sent the band the rough demo, which they approved. Manson requested a small change in the lyrics, disliking the line \"I know when to kiss and I know when to kill\", so Arnold and Black changed \"I\" to \"we\" for the final version.\n\nGarbage drummer and co-producer Butch Vig said that when the group contributed to film soundtracks, \"one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song.\" Manson called herself a fan of the series, \"an institution I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child\", and the films had a \"sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music\". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because \"you know it's going down in movie history\", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, \"that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!\" The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts \"something that you can enjoy on the surface, but underneath there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into.\"\n\nAt the beginning of August Garbage's involvement was confirmed in a press release from MGM and Radioactive Records, Shirley Manson's record label, which would release the soundtrack and the single. Although \"Music Week\" reported that Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Sharleen Spiteri, Björk and Melanie C were rejected by the producers before Garbage was chosen, Arnold denied that the other artists had auditioned; the single was suitable only for a film, and was not created with a particular artist in mind.\n\nThe first recordings were made during the European leg of Garbage's Version 2.0 world tour. After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked on the key and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio from a number of European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by phone as he produced the song's string arrangement in London. Since the strings carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's Metropolis Studios.\n\nGarbage flew to London for a day to record the basic tracks, laying down electric guitar, bass guitar and Manson's vocals with the orchestra. Manson called working with the orchestra \"exhilarating\". That night, the band flew to Switzerland to resume their tour for three weeks. \n\nThe final recording was made in August at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage built upon their first mix of the song, adding and subtracting parts, and completed final recording and mixing. The band kept the arrangement tight to preserve the song's dynamic, sweeping melody. \"The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going dynamically,\" keeping the recording simple, Vig recalled. \"Besides the drums and bass and some percussive loops, there's a little bit of guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear-candy things that we did, but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing.\" Although Garbage owned its own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legal reasons the song could not be recorded in a U.S. studio. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was completed, mixed and mastered at the end of the month, and the group returned to their recording studio in Madison to record their mix of the song. Garbage's version (the \"chilled-out remix\") downplayed the classic Bond sound in favour of the band's style. Vig later said about the original recording, \"We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song.\" However, Manson noted that the version featured in the film “got our hopes and joys squashed,” as “they had completely screwed with all the stems of mix and it sounded completely different.” \n\nTwo songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \"The World Is Not Enough\", alleging that it derived from their song \"This Game We Play\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of \"The Thomas Crown Affair\". Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \"The World Is Not Enough\" which they alleged was identical to part of \"This Game We Play\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for \"Ocean's Eleven\". They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \"The World Is Not Enough\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.\n\nThe case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \"The World Is Not Enough\" and it did not share a passage with \"This Game We Play\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \"This Game We Play\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and testimony from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's personal assistant provided \"irrefutable evidence\" that \"The World Is Not Enough\" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the \"three-note motif\" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that \"This Game We Play\" was submitted to MGM.\n\n The music video for \"The World Is Not Enough\" was directed by Philipp Stölzl for Oil Factory Films and filmed on a London sound stage on September 23–24, 1999. Manson's android shots (the laboratory, kissing and driving scenes) were filmed on the first day, with the pyrotechnic scenes shot on the second. For her \"death\", Manson kissed a lookalike model. The University of London's Senate House was the exterior for the fictional New Globe Theatre. Post-production and editing were completed two weeks later.\n\nIn the video (set in 1964) terrorists build an android replica of Shirley Manson, who can kill her targets with a kiss, on an unnamed Pacific island. The android is fitted with a bomb, primed before it leaves on its mission. The android makes its way to Chicago's New Globe Theater and lets itself into Shirley Manson's dressing room, killing Manson and assuming her identity to perform the coda of a song on a large steel globe. As the android and the band receive a standing ovation from the audience, the bomb counts down. Smiling, the android Manson thrusts its arms in the air; the screen blacks out as the timer reaches zero, and an explosion is heard.\n\nThe video's filming was documented by a \"Making the Video\" camera crew, and premiered on MTV after the program on October 20, 1999; it debuted in the United Kingdom and on \"Total Request Live\" the following day. A version of the video featuring footage from the film was shown in some countries; to preserve the video's narrative, the film footage appeared on a split screen. \"The World Is Not Enough\" video was included on the film's 2000 DVD release and Garbage's 2007 greatest-hits DVD compilation, \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\nIn North America, Radioactive distributed both versions of \"The World Is Not Enough\" to AAA, alternative, modern adult and modern rock radio stations on October 4, 1999. Originally planned for introduction a week later, the radio date was moved up when a Los Angeles station broadcast a ripped, low-quality MP3 of the Chilled Out remix circulated on file-sharing networks early. The single's release coincided with Garbage's return to North America to headline an MTV-sponsored Campus Invasion Tour. The band introduced \"The World Is Not Enough\" on October 20 during a concert at the University of Denver. On November 1, Garbage performed the song live on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\nRadioactive released \"The World Is Not Enough\" in the United Kingdom on November 15 as a limited-edition digipak CD single and a cassette single. Both formats were backed with \"Ice Bandits\", an orchestral track from the David Arnold film score. The CD also included a remix produced by trip hop act Unkle. After one week, \"The World Is Not Enough\" debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, Garbage's 10th top-40 single. It remained on the UK chart for nine weeks. In Ireland, \"The World Is Not Enough\" peaked at number 30.\n\nThe song's music video was aired before the November 11 worldwide live broadcast of the MTV Europe Music Awards. MTV heavily promoted the film during the awards, giving away a BMW Z8 (Bond's car in the film and Shirley Manson's in the video). Radioactive released the single in Europe from November 15 to December 6 as a three-track CD digipak and a two-track card-sleeve single, backed with \"Ice Bandits\".\n\nIn late November 1999, \"The World Is Not Enough\" debuted at number three in Iceland, reaching number one the following week. It debuted at number 54 in Sweden at number seven in Norway, and number 10 in Finland, where it peaked at number seven in its second week. In the Netherlands the single debuted at number 74, rising to number 48 two weeks later. It debuted at number 55 in France and number 12 in Belgium's Wallonia. In December the song debuted at number 40 in Austria, remaining there for four weeks. It debuted at number 22 in Switzerland, rising to number 16 four weeks later at the beginning of January 2000. At the end of December, the song debuted at number 18 in Italy before peaking at number six in February 2000. Also in December, \"The World Is Not Enough\" peaked at number 38 in Germany and number 12 in Spain.\n\nRadioactive followed the single with \"The World Is Not Enough\"s soundtrack album, featuring \"Ice Bandits\" and \"Only Myself to Blame\" (a second David Arnold-Don Black composition, sung by Scott Walker during the end credits). The album was released in North America on November 9, and then internationally. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was included as a bonus track on the Japanese version of Garbage's third album, \"Beautiful Garbage\", and was remastered for \"Absolute Garbage\". It was also included in three editions of the James Bond music compilation \"The Best of Bond...James Bond\": in 2002, 2008 and 2012.\n\n\"The World Is Not Enough\" received mainly positive reviews from music critics. \"Kerrang!\" magazine noted that \"Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever-burgeoning celebrity will be done no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem.\" A \"Radio Times\" reviewer wrote that the song \"sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited\", while AllMusic's Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage \"expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song\". PopMatters called the song a \"top-notch Bond theme\", following the Shirley Bassey template. In a \"Billboard\" review, Chuck Taylor wrote that Garbage was an inspired choice and the song \"rings of international intrigue, with the slinky gait, noir-ish guitar line and grand chorus we have come to expect ... the song's darkly sexy, electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage's distinctive soundprint. [It is] not only the best 007 theme in eons, it is a great Garbage track that should thrill fans of band and Bond alike\". IGN ranked \"The World Is Not Enough\" ninth on its list of top 10 James Bond songs, stating, \"Shirley Manson's warbling croon is a perfect fit for an opening sequence and her bandmates gel well with Arnold's sweeping symphonics.\"\n\nNegative reviews revolved around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a \"perfectly competent Bond theme\", but \"the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps they would have done better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek.\" \"Melody Maker\" stated, \"You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?\" In its review of \"Absolute Garbage\", Pitchfork called the song a \"predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics.\"\n\nThe song appeared in two \"best of 1999\" radio-station polls: number 87 in 89X's Top 89 Songs of 1999 and number 100 in Q101's Top 101 of 1999. In 2012 Grantland ranked \"The World Is Not Enough\" the second-best Bond song of all time, behind \"Goldfinger\".\n\nIn 2002, \"The World Is Not Enough\" was covered by Canadian singer Diana Krall for \"The Songs of Bond\", a UK television special. Four years later Turkish folk musician Müslüm Gürses covered the song on his album \"Aşk Tesadüfleri Sever (Love Loves Coincidences)\". The song was re-arranged with Turkish lyrics and re-titled \"Bir Ömür Yetmez (A Life Is Not Enough)\".\n\nIn 2017, Chris Collingwood, lead singer of Fountains of Wayne, recorded the song with his new band, Look Park, for the multi-artist compilation album, \"Songs, Bond Songs: The Music Of 007\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2326042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326042", "title": "Bifurcation theory", "text": "Bifurcation theory\n\nBifurcation theory is the mathematical study of changes in the qualitative or topological structure of a given family, such as the integral curves of a family of vector fields, and the solutions of a family of differential equations. Most commonly applied to the mathematical study of dynamical systems, a bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change made to the parameter values (the bifurcation parameters) of a system causes a sudden 'qualitative' or topological change in its behavior. Bifurcations occur in both continuous systems (described by ODEs, DDEs or PDEs) and discrete systems (described by maps). The name \"bifurcation\" was first introduced by Henri Poincaré in 1885 in the first paper in mathematics showing such a behavior. Henri Poincaré also later named various types of stationary points and classified them.\n\nIt is useful to divide bifurcations into two principal classes:\n\nA local bifurcation occurs when a parameter change causes the stability of an equilibrium (or fixed point) to change. In continuous systems, this corresponds to the real part of an eigenvalue of an equilibrium passing through zero. In discrete systems (those described by maps rather than ODEs), this corresponds to a fixed point having a Floquet multiplier with modulus equal to one. In both cases, the equilibrium is \"non-hyperbolic\" at the bifurcation point.\nThe topological changes in the phase portrait of the system can be confined to arbitrarily small neighbourhoods of the bifurcating fixed points by moving the bifurcation parameter close to the bifurcation point (hence 'local').\n\nMore technically, consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE\nA local bifurcation occurs at formula_2 if the Jacobian matrix\nformula_3\nhas an eigenvalue with zero real part. If the eigenvalue is equal to zero, the bifurcation is a steady state bifurcation, but if the eigenvalue is non-zero but purely imaginary, this is a Hopf bifurcation.\n\nFor discrete dynamical systems, consider the system\nThen a local bifurcation occurs at formula_2 if the matrix\nformula_3\nhas an eigenvalue with modulus equal to one. If the eigenvalue is equal to one, the bifurcation is either a saddle-node (often called fold bifurcation in maps), transcritical or pitchfork bifurcation. If the eigenvalue is equal to −1, it is a period-doubling (or flip) bifurcation, and otherwise, it is a Hopf bifurcation.\n\nExamples of local bifurcations include:\n\n\nGlobal bifurcations occur when 'larger' invariant sets, such as periodic orbits, collide with equilibria. This causes changes in the topology of the trajectories in the phase space which cannot be confined to a small neighbourhood, as is the case with local bifurcations. In fact, the changes in topology extend out to an arbitrarily large distance (hence 'global').\n\nExamples of global bifurcations include:\n\n\nGlobal bifurcations can also involve more complicated sets such as chaotic attractors (e.g. crises).\n\nThe codimension of a bifurcation is the number of parameters which must be varied for the bifurcation to occur. This corresponds to the codimension of the parameter set for which the bifurcation occurs within the full space of parameters. Saddle-node bifurcations and Hopf bifurcations are the only generic local bifurcations which are really codimension-one (the others all having higher codimension). However, transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations are also often thought of as codimension-one, because the normal forms can be written with only one parameter.\n\nAn example of a well-studied codimension-two bifurcation is the Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation.\n\nBifurcation theory has been applied to connect quantum systems to the dynamics of their classical analogues in atomic systems, molecular systems, and resonant tunneling diodes. Bifurcation theory has also been applied to the study of laser dynamics and a number of theoretical examples which are difficult to access experimentally such as the kicked top and coupled quantum wells. The dominant reason for the link between quantum systems and bifurcations in the classical equations of motion is that at bifurcations, the signature of classical orbits becomes large, as Martin Gutzwiller points out in his classic work on quantum chaos. Many kinds of bifurcations have been studied with regard to links between classical and quantum dynamics including saddle node bifurcations, Hopf bifurcations, umbilic bifurcations, period doubling bifurcations, reconnection bifurcations, tangent bifurcations, and cusp bifurcations.\n\n\n\n"}

His writing focuses on contrasts between darkness and light, between destruction and creativity. Then following is the existential struggle of man to take sides. This is not always easy, however, and the lines between good and bad are not always clearly defined.\n\nHeinesen was captivated by the mysterious part of life, calling himself religious in the broadest sense of the word. His life could be described as a struggle against defeatism with one oft-quoted aphorism of his is that \"life is not despair, and death shall not rule\".\n\nAs he was born and raised before the Faroese language was taught in the schools, he wrote mainly in Danish but his spoken language was Faroese. All his books were later translated into his native Faroese.\n\nHe published his first collection of poetry when he was 21 and he had three more published before he wrote his first novel \"Blæsende gry\" (\"Stormy Dawn\") in 1934. He read every single one of the chapters to the painter Sámal Joensen-Mikines, as he was worried that his Danish was not good enough. That was followed up with \"Noatún\" (1938). Noatún has a strong political message – solidarity is the key to a good society. His next book \"The Black Cauldron\" (1949) deals with the aftermath of decadent living combined with religious hysteria. In \"The Lost Musicians\" (1950) Heinesen leaves the social realism of his earlier works behind, instead giving himself over to straightforward storytelling. \"Mother Pleiades\" (1952) is an ode to his imagination. Its subtitle is \"\"a Story From the Beginning of Time\"\".\n\nHeinesen was not content with writing only novels. In the fifties he began writing short stories as well. Most of them have been printed in these three collections entitled \"The Enchanted Light\", \"Gamaliel's Bewitchment\" and \"Cure Against Evil Spirits\" (1969). In the novel \"The Good Hope\", his main character the Rev. Peder Børresen is based on the historical person Rev. Lucas Debes. When Heinesen was asked how long it had taken to write it, he answered \"Forty years. But then I did other things in between.\"\n\nHe was awarded the Danish literary prize Holberg Medal in 1960.\n\nHe received The Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1965 for his novel \"Det gode håb\" (\"The Good Hope\"), published in 1964. In the story Heinesen had the difficult task of reproducing 17th-century Danish. He succeeded, and won the prize. It is widely considered his best work.\n\nWhen there were rumours that William Heinesen was about to receive the Nobel Prize for literature in 1981, he wrote to the Swedish Academy and renounced his candidacy. Later he explained why:\n\nHe was awarded with the Faroese Literature Prize in 1975.\n\nIn 1980 on his 80th birthday Heinesen was appointed \"Tórshavn's Citizen of Honour\" by his home town.\n\nIn 1980 he received the Danish Critics Prize for Literature (Kritikerprisen).\n\nIn 1984 he received the \"Children's Books Prize of Tórshavn City Council\" (Barnabókaheiðursløn Tórshavnar býráðs)\n\nIn 1985 he was awarded the \"Karen Blixen Medal\" from the Danish Academy.\n\nIn 1987 he was awarded the Swedish Academy Nordic Prize (\"little Nobel\").\n\nInformation in this bibliography is taken from the Danish Literature Centre.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His own son, Hans the Younger, later became a painter as well. From 1488, Burgkmair was a pupil of Martin Schongauer in Colmar. Schongauer died in 1491, before Burgkmair was able to complete the normal period of training. He may have visited Italy at this time, and certainly did so in 1507, which greatly influenced his style. From 1491, he worked in Augsburg, where he became a master and eventually opened his own workshop in 1498.\n\nGerman art historian Friedrich Wilhelm Hollstein ascribes 834 woodcuts to Burgkmair, the majority of which were intended for book illustrations. Slightly more than a hundred are “single-leaf” prints which were not intended for books. His work shows a talent for striking compositions which blend Italian Renaissance forms with the established German style.\n\nFrom about 1508, Burgkmair spent much of his time working on the woodcut projects of Maximilian I until the Emperor's death in 1519. He was responsible for nearly half of the 135 prints in the \"Triumphs of Maximilian\", which are large and full of character. He also did most of the illustrations for \"Weiss Kunig\" and much of \"Theurdank\". He worked closely with the leading blockcutter Jost de Negker, who became in effect his publisher.\n\nHe was an important innovator of the chiaroscuro woodcut, and seems to have been the first to use a tone block, in a print of 1508. His \"\" (1510) is the first chiaroscuro print to use three blocks, and also the first print that was designed to be printed only in colour, as the line block by itself would not make a satisfactory image. Other chiaroscuro prints from around this date by Baldung and Cranach had line blocks that could be and were printed by themselves. He produced one etching, \"Venus and Mercury\" (c1520), etched on a steel plate, but never tried engraving, despite his training with Schongauer.\n\nBurgkmair was also a successful painter, mainly of religious scenes, portraits of Augsburg citizens, and members of the Emperor's court. Many examples of his work are in the galleries of Munich, Vienna and elsewhere.\n\nBurgkmair died at Augsburg in 1531.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2326062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326062", "title": "Evita (soundtrack)", "text": "Evita (soundtrack)\n\nEvita is the third soundtrack album by American singer Madonna. It was released on November 12, 1996, by Warner Bros. Records to promote the 1996 American musical drama film, \"Evita\". The film was based on Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1978 musical of the same name, about First Lady of Argentina, Eva Perón. Additional performers on \"Evita\" include Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce and Jimmy Nail, but it is considered a Madonna album since she sang the majority of the songs. After securing the title role in \"Evita\", Madonna underwent vocal training in order to enhance her singing abilities. Director Alan Parker worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber to compose the soundtrack, reworking the original songs as well as write a new song, \"You Must Love Me\", for the film.\n\nThe actors were tense during the recording sessions for \"Evita\", since they were from a non-musical background. The musical style for \"Evita\" differed from Madonna's previous works and she was not comfortable in recording her vocals inside the studio alongside the orchestra. After an emergency meeting with the principal personnel, it was decided she would record in a separate location. It took almost four months for the soundtrack to be finished. Rice and Lloyd Webber had employed the classical technique while creating the music, taking the central theme, \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\", and tweaking it to cater to a variety of settings. Through the songs, the soundtrack tells the story of Eva Perón's beginnings, her rise to fame, political career and gradually her death.\n\nThe soundtrack was released in two different versions. A two-disc edition which featured all the tracks from the film, and a single-disc edition contained a selection of song highlights. \"Evita\" was promoted by the release of three singles—\"You Must Love Me\", \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" and \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\"—the former won the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997. Critical reception towards the soundtrack was mixed, with AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling it \"unengaging\" while \"Hartford Courant\"s Greg Morago praised Madonna's singing abilities. \"Evita\" was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts in Austria, Belgium, Scotland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, while attaining top-ten positions in other major musical markets. In the United States, the soundtrack reached a peak of number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nIn 1996, Madonna starred in the film \"Evita\", playing the role of Eva Perón, the Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even wrote a letter to director Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. Madonna had already enlisted the help of composers Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who had originally created \"Evita\" the musical. Rice believed that the singer would suit in the title role since she could \"act beautifully through music\".\n\nHowever Lloyd Webber was still wary about Madonna's singing, so after securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader. Since \"Evita\" required the actors to sing their own parts, the training helped in increasing Madonna's confidence in the songs. Lader noted that the singer \"had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. \"Evita\" is real musical theater — its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had.\" She taught Madonna how to sing using her diaphragm rather than just her throat, enabling her to project her voice in a more cohesive manner. Madonna was thrilled to find the newly discovered nuances in her voice and would go home every night, practicing by telephoning her friends and singing to them.\n\nParker finished writing the script for the film by May 1995. He then visited Lloyd Webber's home in France, and tried to bring him and Rice together for working on the film; the duo had not worked with each other for years after the musical \"Cricket\" (1986). While drafting the script, Parker had re-written the last act, removing the repetitive content of the original play. This resulted in Rice and Lloyd Webber composing new music, including the new song \"You Must Love Me\". Parker knew that the pre-recorded playback would be the main backbone for the filming, hence was wary about the decisions he had to make in the recording studio. He pondered over the script and the music, expecting any questions that the actors would have for later.\n\nRecording sessions began in September 1995, and took place at the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience \"scary\" while Madonna was \"petrified\" when it came to recording the songs. \"I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber ... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. I thought I had done a terrible job\", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; \"On film, it's different than being on stage because the person on the screen in front of you is never farther than someone on the pillow in bed next to you\". Parker declared the first day of recording as \"Black Monday\", since it was \"filled with trepidation and nerves ... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were very apprehensive\".\n\nAccording to producer Nigel Wright, the lead actors would first sing the numbers backed by a band and orchestra, \"then they would go off with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals\". However, more trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a \"guide vocal\" simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; \"I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't ... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment\", she recalled.\n\nAn emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part at Whitfield Street, a contemporary studio, while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording to save and strengthen her voice. Recording the soundtrack was a slow process and took almost four months before it was completed. But Parker noticed at the end of recording that they did not have the new song in place. Recalling in his \"The Making of Evita\" essay:\n\nFinally, while I was visiting Andrew at his country estate in Berkshire to play him the tracks we had recorded, he suddenly sat down at the piano and played the most beautiful melody, which he suggested could be our new song. Needless to say, I grabbed it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The vast majority of the original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to \"You Must Love Me\".\n\nMadonna's vocals are featured on 15 of the 19 tracks present in the soundtrack. Other principal vocalists include Banderas, Pryce and Jimmy Nail. Rikky Rooksby noted in \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\" that \"Evita\" was stylistically different than the music Madonna had recorded previously. The soundtrack was her most challenging endeavor since the Stephen Sondheim songs recorded for the 1990 film, \"Dick Tracy\". Rice and Lloyd Webber employed the classical technique while creating the music, where a composer takes a central theme and adapts it to a variety of settings, keys and tempos. The central backbone and theme of the soundtrack is \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\", and through the songs it tells the story of Eva's beginnings, her rise to fame, political career and gradually her death.\n\nThe soundtrack begins with the tracks \"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952\" and \"Requiem for Evita\", both conducted by John Mauceri, dealing with the announcement of Eva's death. Following this \"Oh What a Circus\" begins, where Banderas takes the lead vocals. Built on the uptempo melody of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\", the song has rock influences and piano sounds. After a short interlude by Nail, \"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\", a distorted electric guitar and bass heralds \"Eva and Magaldi / Eva Beware of the City\". Here the lyrics talk about warning Eva from strangers in the big city. The sound of train horns, Latin percussion, drums, and light guitars introduce \"Buenos Aires\", talking about Eva finally arriving in the city. The melody finds Madonna singing in a higher range, and the song has a heavy composition in the middle with guitar, trumpets and discordant music. \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" begins with soft strummed guitar in broken chords, and consists of strings and acoustic guitar played in a subdued manner. Madonna sings about Eva moving from one home to another, portraying an image—the suitcase in the hall—\"to express the nomadic nature of modern civilization\".\n\nIn \"Goodnight and Thank You\", Madonna and Banderas trade verses, talking about ending Eva's love affairs, followed by Banderas' solo \"The Lady's Got Potential\", musing about Eva's gradual rise on the society ladder. The gentle ballad, \"I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You\", is about Eva meeting her husband Juan Perón; its composed of flutes, classical guitar and subdued strings. Military drum beats and a brass section start off \"Peron's Latest Flame\", where Banderas sings loudly about the general population disapproving of Eva. In the middle of a male backing chorus, Madonna sings her lines, accompanied by stereo tom-tom drum and synth sounds. For \"A New Argentina\", electric guitar and chorus form the main backbone. Composed as an \"uprising hymn\", Rooksby noted that Madonna's vocals sounded \"aggressive and growling\".\nThe second disc begins with \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\", whose lyrics are described as a \"string of meaningless platitudes\" by Rice, adding that it worked as a speech by a \"megalomaniac woman\" like Eva, trying to win the favor of the people of Argentina. The composition consist of pizzicato strings, and the song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. \"High Flying, Adored\" has an Elton John like style according to Rooksby, who described the lyrics as narcissistic and a parallel with Madonna's life. \"RainBow High\" features instrumentation from drums, guitars, horns and strings, with the lyrics being about Eva's materialistic needs.\n\nWith \"Waltz for Eva and Che\", the soundtrack's atmosphere becomes tense, as Banderas and Madonna sing on top of bass and timpani. The bittersweet song \"You Must Love Me\" starts with the sound of orchestra and piano. Lyrically it talks about Eva's discovery that her husband Juan had actually loved her all along and not merely seen her as a political prop. As the song moves towards the chorus, the piano sounds stop and the cello plays with Madonna belting out the lyrics: \"Deep in my heart, I'm concealing, Things that I'm longing to say\", when the piano and the orchestra sounds come back again. It proceeds in the same way and gradually fades out. The final track, \"Lament\", finds Madonna singing in a whispered tone, about Eva looking back at her life on her deathbed. Accompanied by classical guitar and harp, Banderas also sings over Eva's grave, and the track gradually fades out as an anti-climax.\n\nThe soundtrack was released in the United States on November 12, 1996, almost two weeks before the release of the film. It was already in huge demand prior to its release, according to Tim Devin, manager of Tower Records. \"People are seriously clamouring for it. We are getting more inquiries about this record than anything else right now,\" Devin explained to \"Billboard\"s Larry Flick. Warner Bros. depended on pre-release press reviews, consumer curiosity and the singles from the soundtrack to keep the interest afloat, until the album was released. Jeff Gold, VP/GM of Warner Bros. declared the release as a \"worldwide event that has ignited public interest throughout each stage of its evolution\".\n\n\"Evita\" consisted of two formats, a two-disc edition titled \"The Complete Motion Picture Music Soundtrack\", containing all the tracks used on the film, and a single-disc edition, \"Music from the Motion Picture\", which contained only a selection of highlights. International release strategy of the soundtrack was similar to that of the United States, with November 25 as the date, and the single-disc edition planned for release later in December. An \"Evita\" EP, containing remixed versions of \"Buenos Aires\", \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" and \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\", was supposed to be released but was cancelled.\n\n\"You Must Love Me\" was released as the soundtrack's lead single on October 27, 1996. It was written specifically for the film with the hopes of obtaining an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. According to Lloyd Webber, the song's main inspiration was to showcase Eva's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with Juan. The song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting Madonna's enhanced singing ability. It went on to win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997. It was also a moderate commercial success, becoming a top-ten hit in some countries including Finland and the United Kingdom, while reaching the top-twenty in the United States, where it achieved a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was released as the second single from the album on February 4, 1997. A separate version called the \"Miami Mix\", which included re-recorded vocals in English and Spanish and an Argentinean bandoneon in the song's intro, was promoted to radio. Madonna's vocals received positive critical response and the song reached the top-ten of the charts a number of nations, including the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and received gold certifications from five of them.\n\n\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" was the third and final single released on March 3, 1997. Upon its release, the song reached the top ten of the charts in the United Kingdom. The track \"Buenos Aires\" received remix treatment from DJ duo Pablo Flores-Javier Garza. Warner Bros. was initially reluctant to release the remixes, but decided to finally release it to coincide with the home video release of \"Evita\" the film. Flores and Garza kept the Latin composition of the track, while \"flattening\" the groove to make it suitable for playing in dance floors. They also added a live percussion and keyboard lines to the remix. Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" commented that \"Buenos Aires\" displayed Madonna's \"increased comfort and dexterity as a stylist\". Following its promotional release in October 1997, \"Buenos Aires\" peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs chart.\n\n\"Evita\" has received generally mixed reviews from music critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of \"\" felt that Madonna's singing sounded \"supple and strong\", and believed her to be not \"at all out of place\". Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson wrote in their book \"The Madonna Companion\" that the soundtrack gave Madonna \"some of the post-disco queen/sex machine credibility she so desperately crave[d]\". Writing for the \"Hartford Courant\", Greg Morago complimented Madonna's vocals and her \"remarkable understanding of the material ... While some of the numbers have lost their sharp edge ('A New Argentina' lacks requisite anger), the recording benefits from its concentration on the characters' voices. There is a vibrant, contemporary energy and fearless cinematic sweep to this welcome new stamp on the mythic life of Eva Duarte de Perón\".\n\nIn her review of \"Evita\", Janet Maslin from \"The New York Times\" complimented Madonna's ability to emote the songs calling them \"legitimately stellar and full of fire\". Stefan A. Meyer, from \"The Herald Journal\", felt that \"there's a little something for everyone in \"Evita\". It's a pop-culture clash that is sometimes quite annoying (especially in Rice's left-field rhymes) but still works like a charm\". \"Spin\"s Annie Zaleski noted that the soundtrack demonstrated Madonna's \"astronomical growth as a vocalist ...\"Evita\" marked the start of Madonna's Serious Phase, one where she balanced youthful coquettish-ness with a more mature, introspective outlook\". Greg Kot from the \"Chicago Tribune\", wrote that \"the two-CD soundtrack casts Madonna in a new light. To put it simply, the Material Girl can sing. [...] comparing her performance [on the soundtrack] to that of Patti LuPone, one comes away with a new admiration for her vocal skills. In many ways, she does more with less than her predecessor\".\n\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling the soundtrack \"unengaging\". He theorized that it was due to Madonna's performance. Erlewine commended Madonna's singing but deduced that her vocals made the songs sound like she was \"trying \"really\" hard to be credible, which makes it difficult to connect with her\". While reviewing the film, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\"s Octavio Roca's feeling about the soundtrack was mixed, saying that the \"delicious irony of Rice's lyrics remains intact, as does the freshness of Lloyd Webber's music\". But Roca believed that the Latin influences present in the original songs were missing, due to John Mauceri's \"languid conducting of the soundtrack, and most of all by Vincent Paterson's choreography\". Barbara Shulgasser, from the same newspaper, was more negative, writing that \"all of \"Evita\"s songs are slightly above Madonna's limited range. With her thin voice, she peeps out a series of mournful sounds that are painful to endure\". Also negative was \"The Baltimore Sun\"s J. D. Considine, who felt the soundtrack would disappoint the singer's fans \"because \"Evita\" just isn't pop music—or, at least, not the kind of pop music Madonna usually makes on her own ... As a result, slogging through \"Evita\" is like listening to an opera written by someone who never got beyond learning how to write recitativo\". Considine was also disappointed with the vocal abilities of Madonna and co-star Antonio Banderas; \"they lack the power and tone to lend this intoned dialog a patina of musicality\". Finally, Owen Gleiberman from \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it a \"soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Evita\" debuted at number six on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart for the issue dated November 30, 1996. It was the first entry on the chart for a \"broadway musical transitioned into film soundtrack\" since \"\" in 1978. The soundtrack fell to number 28 the next week, before beginning to rise again when the film was released into theaters. Within five weeks it crept back into the top-ten of the \"Billboard\" 200 and for the issue dated February 8, 1997, reached a peak of number two on the chart. This was spurred by Madonna winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Sales increased by 17.5% to 122,000 sold for that week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It remained there for two weeks, being kept from topping the chart by No Doubt's album \"Tragic Kingdom\", which only had an 8% sales decline to 143,000 copies.\n\n\"Evita\" was present for a total of 30 weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200, and ranked at number 26 on the year-end chart. Along with the \"Billboard\" 200, \"Evita\" reached the top of the Soundtracks Albums chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the soundtrack quintuple platinum, for shipment of 2.5 million copies across the country. As of December 2016, the album had sold 2,025,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The single-disc edition of the soundtrack charted separately on the \"Billboard\" 200, reaching a peak of number 167.\n\nIn Canada, \"Evita\" debuted at number 27 on the \"RPM\" Top Albums/CDs chart. It reached a peak of number five on the chart, and stayed for a total of 27 weeks. The single-disc edition also charted separately, reaching a peak of number 91. In Australia, the soundtrack debuted on the ARIA Charts at number six. After fluctuating down the charts for the next few weeks, it climbed into the top-ten in March 1997, and peaked at number five. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the two-disc edition as gold and the single-disc edition as platinum for shipment of 35,000 and 70,000 copies respectively. The soundtrack had a similar trajectory in New Zealand, where it peaked at number six on the albums chart, and was present for a total of 18 weeks. The Recorded Music New Zealand (RMNZ) certified it platinum, for shipment of 15,000 copies.\n\n\"Evita\" debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart and ended up reaching the top of the charts in February 1997, becoming Madonna's fifth number one album in the country. It was present on the chart for a total of 44 weeks and ranked at number 23 on the year-end chart. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it double platinum for shipment of 600,000 copies. It has sold 733,000 copies as of January 2018 according to the Official Charts Company. Across Europe, \"Evita\" reached the top of the charts in Austria, Belgium (both Flanders and Wallonia), Scotland and Switzerland, as well as top-ten in Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Its performance across the European markets resulted in the soundtrack reaching the top of the pan-European Top 100 Albums chart.

He began using his middle name professionally to differentiate himself well-known comedian Lee Evans. For a time he was known as Lee Latchford before adding a hyphen between his middle name and surname.\n\nBefore going into music, Evans was an aspiring footballer and had trials with several football clubs. He starred in a school production of \"Grease\" as a pupil at Sutton High School and went on to the Cheshire School of Dance and Drama, now part of West Cheshire College.\n\nIn 1997, Evans became a member of the pop group Steps; they went on to sell 14 consecutive Top 5 singles (a feat for a British act, at the time, bettered only by the Beatles), sold more than 20 million records worldwide. They announced their split on Boxing Day 2001. His role in the group was mostly choreographer and providing backing vocals, and he rarely sang lead on the songs. However, he did perform lead on \"Turn Around\" (which he co-wrote) and the two verses of 5,6,7,8.\n\nEvans has appeared in London's West End starring in \"Grease\"; \"A Charmed Life\" as part of London's Sitcom Trials, and he made his debut at the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh in August 2009 in the production of \"Wolfboy\".

The other Jerusalem station on this line is the Biblical Zoo station which is served by limited stops. Jerusalem Malha was opened on April 9, 2005, when the historic Jaffa–Jerusalem railway was restored after being out of service for six years. The line underwent a major renovation, including the laying of new tracks. Jerusalem Malha replaced the historic Jerusalem railway station near the Old City as the terminus of the line, which was not restored due to the objections of area residents over train noise. Malha station is located relatively far from the city's center and travel time to it from Tel Aviv is relatively long due to the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway's serpentine 19th century era route and only single-track through the Judean mountains.\n\nIn the end of the 2010s decade the new Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway opened. This new double-track, electrified railway offers more convenient travel between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, more than halving the journey time by rail between the two cities compared to the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. The new railway terminates at the centrally-located Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon station which is situated across the street from the Central Bus Station and offers easy transfer to the Jerusalem Light Rail. There are conceptual plans to someday connect the line from Navon station to Malha station.\n\nSince February 5, 2006, intercity bus routes to Gush Etzion and the Hebron area stop at Jerusalem Malha Train Station on their way from the Jerusalem Central Bus Station to their destination via Begin Boulevard.\n\n"}

It provides SDKs for C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift and TypeScript, and can run on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS and Android.\nIce implements a proprietary application layer communications protocol, called the Ice protocol, that can run over TCP, TLS, UDP, WebSocket and Bluetooth. As its name indicates, Ice can be suitable for applications that communicate over the Internet, and includes functionality for traversing firewalls.\n\nZeroC was founded in 2002 in Florida.\nIce was influenced by the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) in its design, and indeed was created by several influential CORBA developers, including Michi Henning. However, according to ZeroC, it was smaller and less complex than CORBA because it was designed by a small group of experienced developers, instead of suffering from design by committee.\n\nIn 2004, it was reported that a game called \"Wish\" by a company named Mutable Realms used Ice.\nIn 2008, it was reported that Big Bear Solar Observatory had used the software since 2005.\nThe source code repository for Ice is on GitHub since May 2015.\n\nIce components include object-oriented remote-object-invocation, replication, grid-computing, failover, load-balancing, firewall-traversals and publish-subscribe services. To gain access to those services, applications are linked to a stub library or assembly, which is generated from a language-independent IDL-like syntax called \"slice\".\n\nis an object-oriented publish-and-subscribe framework that also supports federation and quality-of-service.

For example, a user who wishes to deploy new functionality and/or patches to several servers may use IcePatch.\n\nis a proxy-based service to enable communication through firewalls, thus making ICE an internet communication engine.\n\nIcebox is a service-oriented architecture container of executable services implemented in .dll or .so libraries. This is a lighter alternative to building entire executable for every service.\n\nSlice is a ZeroC-proprietary file format that programmers follow to edit computer-language independent declarations and definitions of classes, interfaces, structures and enumerations. Slice definition files are used as input to the stub generating process. The stub in turn is linked to applications and servers that should communicate with one another based on interfaces and classes as declared/defined by the slice definitions.\n\nApart from CORBA, classes and interfaces support inheritance and abstract classes. In addition, slice provides configuration options in form of macros and attributes to direct the code generation process. An example is the directive to generate a certain STL codice_1 template instead of the default, which is to generate a STL codice_2 template.\n\n\n"}

After the Franco-Prussian War he became editor of the \"Pays\" and the \"Constitutionnel\" in succession. In collaboration with the engineer and dramatist Louis Denayrouze (b. 1848) he produced the play \"Regina Sarpi\", and in 1877 \"Marthe\".\n\nOhnet was an admirer of Georges Sand and bitterly opposed to the realistic modern novel. He began a series of novels, \"Les Batailles de la vie\", of a simple and idealistic character, which, although attacked by the critics as unreal and commonplace, were very popular. The series included \"Serge Panine\" (1881) which was crowned by the Academy; \"Le Maître de forges\" (1882), \"La Grande Marnière\" (1885), \"Volonté\" (1888), \"Dernier Amour\" (1891). Many of his novels have been dramatized with great success, \"Le Maître de forges\", produced at the Gymnase in 1883, holding the stage for a whole year. His later publications include \"Le Crépuscule\" (1902), \"Le Marchand de Poison\" (1903), \"La Conquérante\" (1905), \"La dixième muse\" (1906). In 1902 he was elected president of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques.\n\nOhnet was a great reader of public taste. It was this astute understanding of his readership that helped him devise the passionate style he became famous for. He disdained the romantic melodrama motif, choosing instead to explore complex passion. His literary genius lays in being able to introduce originality into a genre so deeply archetypal as the romantic melodrama. It was this quality that made him one of the most widely read writers of his time.\n\nOhnet's \"magnum opus\" was the novel \"Le Maître de forges\" (\"The Owner of The Ironworks\", 1882). The book became an instant hit, finding wide acceptance not only among French readers but also readers around Europe. Soon after its publication, it was translated into Spanish by the Filipino writer Codorníu Julia.\n\nOhnet enjoyed success with his other works too. \"Countess Sarah\" (1882), \"Lise Fleuron\" (1884), \"The Ladies of Croix-Mort\" (1886), \"Will\" (1888), \"Dr. Rameu\" (1889), \"Serge Panine\" (1890) and \"At The Bottom of The Abyss\" (1899), the last of these widely regarded as one of his best works.\n\n\n"}

Chioma Ajunwa is the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal in a field event. Ajunwa is also an officer with the Nigerian Police Force.. She is the first and only woman to compete in the FIFA Women's World Cup as a footballer as well as the Olympic games doing track and field. .\n\nBorn into what she describes as \"a very poor home\", Ahiazu-Mbaise-native Ajunwa was the last of nine children, with six brothers and two sisters. Her father died while she was still young, leaving his wife to solely support a large family. At eighteen Ajunwa, who had been a keen athletics participant during her school years, gained admission into university but was unable to register due to her mother's inability to pay the fees. She later decided to become a motor mechanic, but abandoned the idea following her mother's disapproval.\n\nAs a professional sportswoman, Ajunwa originally played football for the Nigerian women's team and was a member of \"The Falcons\" during the Women's World Cup in 1991, but as she was constantly benched her skill was seldom used. Of her short-lived football career Ajunwa has stated \"I've not regretted the decision [to leave football] because I've made my mark in athletics. I could have continued with football but there was a particular coach... He knew then that I was the best player in the team but he decided to keep me on the bench throughout every match so I left the team's camp.

She competed at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze medal in the 4 x 100 metres relay, and competed at the African Championships in 1989 and the All Africa Games in 1991 where she won gold medals in the long jump. Ajunwa was banned from the sport for four years after failing a drug test in 1992 despite maintaining her innocence.\nFollowing the completion of her suspension, Ajunwa went on to become the first West-African woman, as well as the first Nigerian, to win an Olympic gold medal in a track and field event when she emerged victorious in the women's long jump event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, with a jump length of 7.12 meters (on her first attempt) during the final. In 2003, she stated in an interview with \"The Vanguard\" \"I toiled so much for this country, but then I was dumped...That I could be the only individual gold medal winner for Nigeria in over half- a-century of participation in the Olympics and I could still be treated like a scourge, I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nFollowing her Olympic gold medal at Atlanta '96, Ajunwa was given a national award – \" Member of the Order of Niger\" (MON) – by the then Head of State of Nigeria Sani Abacha, but complained that she was overlooked compared to the Nigerian football team claiming \"I was given the MON award, right, but without 'E-Y.'

This makes him the top flying ace of the Finnish Air Force, leading all Finnish pilots in score against Soviet aircraft in World War II (1939–40 and 1941–44), with 94 confirmed aerial combat victories in 437 sorties. He himself claimed 126 victories. He achieved 34 of his victories while flying the Brewster Buffalo fighter.\n\nOne of the four double recipients of the Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class, Juutilainen was born in Lieksa, and died in Tuusula. His brother was the Finnish Army Captain Aarne Juutilainen.\n\nJuutilainen flew Fokker D.XXI, Brewster Buffalo, and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. He finished the war without a single hit to his plane from enemy fighter airplanes (once he was forced to land after a friendly anti-aircraft gun fired at his Bf 109). Like Japanese fighter ace Saburō Sakai, Juutilainen never lost a wingman in combat. He also scored the first radar-assisted victory in the Finnish Air Force on 24 March 1943, when he was guided to a Soviet Pe-2 by a German radar operator, who was testing out the freshly-delivered radar sets, that officially became operational 3 days later.\n\nJuutilainen entered the Finnish military on 9 September 1932 for his compulsory military service, serving as a pilot in the Finnish Air Force starting in 1935. On 1 May 1935, Juutilainen was promoted to sergeant. He was transferred to \"LeLv 24\", operating from Utti, on March 3, 1939. In October 1939, with the situation worsening, the squadron moved to Immola, closer to the Finnish-Soviet frontier.During the Winter War (which broke on 30 November 1939) Juutilainen flew the Fokker D.XXI. He scored his first victory on 19 December 1939, shooting down an Ilyushin DB-3 bomber and damaging two more. At the end of the Winter War, Juutilainen had achieved one shared and two individual victories.\nDuring the Continuation War, Juutilainen served in \"3/LeLv 24\", flying a Brewster B-239 \"Buffalo\".\n\nOn 21 July 1941, Juutilainen and five other Buffaloes scrambled to intercept Soviet fighters from 65th ShAP that were strafing Finnish troops near Käkisalmi. During that sortie, he destroyed a Polikarpov I-153 'Chaika', making him an \"ace\" in the Brewster Buffalo.\n\nA few days later, on 1 August, seven fighters under the command of First Lieutenant Karhunen destroyed six I-16s near Rautjarvi, and Juutilainen (having been promoted to Warrant Officer in the meantime) claimed two of them.\n\nOn the morning of 6 February 1942, while reconnoitering the Petrovkiy-Jam region with other LLv 24 pilots, Juutilainen intercepted seven Tupolev SB bombers escorted by 12 MiG-3s. Juutilainen claimed two SBs.\n\nJuutilainen later recalled:\n\nOn 27–28 March 1942, \"3/LLv 24\" moved to Immola in preparation for a Finnish Army offensive on Suursaari, in the Gulf of Finland. Although grossly outnumbered over the Gulf of Finland, \"LeLv 24\" pilots were more experienced than their Soviet opponents from Red Banner Baltic Fleet. Even when they had the advantage of surprise and height, Soviet pilots did not succeed in shooting down Finnish pilots.\n\nOn 28 March, WO Juutilainen, in patrol with Sgt Huotari, attacked some \"Chaikas\" of 11 IAP over the Suurkyla shoreline, at Gogland, and shot down two of them. These air victories took Juutilainen's tally to 22. A month later, on 26 April, he became his unit's first recipient of the Mannerheim Cross.\n\nOn 20 September, he took off with Capt Jorma Karhunen and \"3/LeLv 24\" pilots for a patrol of the Kronstadt--Seiskari region. Near the Estonian coast, they were bounced by ten Soviet fighters. But the Finnish quickly reacted and managed to down three of their opponents. WO Juutilainen was credited with two kills.\n\nAll in all, Juutilainen scored 34 victories in Brewster B-239, 28 of them (including three triple kills) between 9 July 1941 and 22 November 1942, in his BW-364 \"Orange 4\".\n\nIn 1943, Juutilainen was transferred to \"LeLv 34\", which used new Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2s. With the Bf 109, he shot down a further 58 enemy planes. He shot down six Soviet airplanes on 30 June 1944 (all confirmed on Soviet loss records), becoming an ace in a day and parallelling Jorma Sarvanto's score on 6 January 1940 in the Winter War.\n\nJuutilainen refused an officer commission, fearing it would keep him from flying.\n\nHis 94th and last victory was a Li-2, the Russian version of the Douglas C-47, shot down on 3 September 1944 over the Karelian Isthmus.\n\nAfter the wars, Juutilainen served in the air force until 1947. He worked as a professional pilot until 1956, flying people in his De Havilland Moth. His last flight was in 1997 at age 83, in a two-seat F-18 Hornet of the Finnish Air Force.\n\nJuutilainen died at home in Tuusula (Tusby) on his 85th birthday on 21 February 1999.\n\n"}

He was also a member of Iron Maiden. He first became famous in 1986 as keyboard player with the band Cutting Crew, and in 1997 he founded The Kashmir Klub to showcase live music in London.\n\nTony Moore's background in the music industry has been eclectic and diverse. The first band he joined in 1977 was (the then unknown) Iron Maiden. A fan of progressive rock, Moore was working in the Hi-Fi department of Debenhams store in Bristol, and had just bought a small Korg synthesiser when he saw an advertisement in the \"Melody Maker\" for a keyboard player for a London band. This turned out to be Iron Maiden. He contacted Steve Harris (who shared a fondness for progressive rock), then auditioned and was invited to join the band. He moved to London to begin rehearsals. At that time members of the band all had day jobs and rehearsed once or twice a week. As this was the height of the pub rock era, their first gig with the new line-up was at a pub called The Bridgehouse in Canning Town.\n\nIn Moore's own words: The whole gig was a bit of a blur (as live performances often are). The adrenaline, the nerves, the concentration all played their part to produce a misty memory of the event.\n\nHowever, I think it is right to say, everyone felt there was something fundamentally not right in what was happening. For my part, I felt that the whole show felt a little pub rock and amateurish, I didn't think that my contribution was actually enhancing the band.\n\nIn many ways it was an important bad gig. I think that, had the gig gone well, we may have struggled on with that lineup when, in hindsight, it was so obviously wrong.\n\nThe following weeks produced a sense of unrest within the band and a feeling that things were unspoken and resentments and frustrations were being suppressed just below the surface. I remember the last rehearsal I had with the group, in a railway arch midway between Elephant and Castle and Blackfriars Bridge, where things seemed strained and un-natural.\n\nI think I realised at that point, that the band didn't really need a keyboard player. No matter how much I liked and respected Steve's dream, and passion and energy, I didn't seem to fit in.\n\nMoore decided to leave to join Tanz Der Youth soon afterwards, as he felt keyboards did not suit the sound Iron Maiden were looking for. Iron Maiden would later evolve into a more progressive act, with keyboards featured on every album since 1988. In Tanz Der Youth, he began working with Brian James (from The Damned) releasing a single I'm Sorry on RADAR Records, touring in support for Black Sabbath and The Stranglers, before moving on to join a progressive rock band called England. In the early 1980s, he formed his own group called Radio Java and made an album at Abbey Road Studios that spawned a number-one hit single in the Netherlands, before disbanding after the label closed down.\n\nIn 1986, Moore was invited to play live keyboards with a new band called Cutting Crew who went on to have a worldwide hit with \"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\". For two more years he toured the world and recorded with the band, at which point he signed a solo deal with a small independent label in London. He released one single to critical acclaim (including airplay from Bob Harris) before joining forces with Argentine singer-songwriter Marie Claire D'ubaldo. He co-wrote and co-produced tracks for her debut album on Polydor, which sold over 250,000 copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2001, Moore performed his own composition, \"That's My Love\" in the A Song For Europe contest, hoping to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. He finished second in the competition, behind Lindsay Dracass. He had written other songs for the contest in earlier years.\n\nIn 2005, after several years concentrating on club management, Moore resumed his solo musical career and began recording his own material independently. He announced his intention to produce an album, with almost no budget, no major record company backing and only nine days to record, mix and master the final product. This resulted in a 13-track solo album entitled \"Perfect and Beautiful\", recorded at Sphere Studios in London, released in July 2005.\n\nIn March 2006, Moore toured America, performing in Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles and New York and has continued to perform live on his return to the UK in April 2006.\n\nMore recently, Moore has been touring acoustically in pubs all over the Home Counties. He also performs regularly at The Bedford, Balham and The Regal Room in London.\n\nEarly in 2008, Moore became the regular presenter of a one-hour live show called \"Let's Talk Music\" for the Maltese television station One TV. Broadcast every Thursday night at 8.35 pm (Maltese time), it features a panel of music professionals who discuss different aspects of the music business and answer questions from the audience, together with live performances by celebrity guests. He also has a regular Thursday morning preview slot on the show \"One Breakfast\".\n\nIn October 2010, Moore was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award for his unique contribution to music.\n\nIn 1997, he established The Kashmir Klub in London. The formula of providing an excellent sound system, sourcing the best of emerging and established artists, hosting the show – like live TV – and getting everyone to perform in an acoustic and \"back to basics\" format, quickly made it into one of the most important live music venues in London. Over its seven-year history Moore introduced debut London performances from Damien Rice, Tom Baxter, Lucie Silvas, and KT Tunstall as well as unannounced sets from Sheryl Crow, Dave Stewart, Fleetwood Mac, Nik Kershaw, Rick Astley and many more. The Kashmir closed in 2003 after the building was closed for re-development.\n\nIn July 2003, he took over the management of music nights at The Bedford in Balham, creating a similar live music venue, with an emphasis on emerging talent as well as established acts. It won Best Pub in the country in 2004, and has twice won the best pub and club award as well as the \"Evening Standard\" pub of the year. Moore was one of the first promoters to pioneer the use of the Internet and the regular live performances at The Bedford are freely available to all four nights a week, via a dedicated webcam and chatroom.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Moore co-presented an overnight show on BBC London 94.9 FM where he brought live music guests into the studio and championed the cause of new talent.\n\nIn 2004, he was made the sole Inductee into the MMF (Music Managers Forum) Roll of Honour for outstanding contribution to the British Music Industry.\n\nIn 2006, he started to collaborate with Quirky Motion on the weekly Bedford Bandstand music program, which he presents. Each show seeks to bring a new artist to a wider audience. These episodes are freely available both as a podcast and on YouTube.\n\nTony Moore opened an additional live acoustic venue, The Regal Room, in December 2006, based at The Distillers, 64, Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, London. Showcasing up-and-coming artists, this is run along the same lines as the Kashmir Klub and The Bedford, with free entry and live webcasts.\n\n"}

{"id": "2326240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326240", "title": "Trazodone", "text": "Trazodone\n\nTrazodone, sold under many brand names, is an antidepressant medication. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and, with other medications, alcohol dependence. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side-effects include dry mouth, feeling faint, vomiting, and headache. More serious side effects may include suicide, mania, irregular heart rate, and pathologically prolonged erections. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is a phenylpiperazine compound of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) class. Trazodone also has sedating effects.\nTrazodone was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. The cost in the United Kingdom for the NHS is about £7.46 per month as of 2019. In the United States, the wholesale cost is about 4.53 per month as of 2018. In 2017, it was the 30th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 22 million prescriptions.\nTrazodone has the following medical uses:\n\n\nThe primary use of trazodone is the treatment of major depression. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest the antidepressant efficacy of trazodone is comparable to that of amitriptyline, doxepin, and mianserin. Also, trazodone showed anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects.\n\nBecause trazodone has minimal anticholinergic activity, it was especially welcomed as a treatment for geriatric patients with depression when it first became available. Three double-blind studies reported trazodone has antidepressant efficacy similar to that of other antidepressants in geriatric patients. However, a side effect of trazodone, orthostatic hypotension, which may cause dizziness and increase the risk of falling, can have devastating consequences for elderly patients; thus, this side effect, along with sedation, often makes trazodone less acceptable for this population, compared with newer compounds that share its lack of anticholinergic activity but not the rest of its side-effect profile. Still, trazodone is often helpful for geriatric patients with depression who have severe agitation and insomnia.\n\nMany clinicians use low-dose trazodone as an alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia. Two recent reviews found that trazodone is the second most prescribed agent for insomnia, but as most studies have been limited to people with depression, few studies actually support trazodone's use in primary insomnia.\n\nOff-label uses and investigational uses are listed below:\n\n\nTrazodone is available in the form of 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg tablets for oral ingestion.\n\nAn extended release formulation at 150 mg and 300 mg as tablets is also available.\n\nBecause of its lack of anticholinergic side effects, trazodone is especially useful in situations in which antimuscarinic effects are particularly problematic (e.g., in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, closed-angle glaucoma, or severe constipation). Trazodone's propensity to cause sedation is a dual-edged sword. For many patients, the relief from agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be rapid; for other patients, including those individuals with considerable psychomotor retardation and feelings of low energy, therapeutic doses of trazodone may not be tolerable because of sedation. Trazodone elicits orthostatic hypotension in some people, probably as a consequence of α-adrenergic receptor blockade. The unmasking of bipolar disorder may occur with trazodone and other antidepressants.\n\nPrecautions for trazodone include known hypersensitivity to trazodone and under 18 years and combined with other antidepressant medications, it may increase the possibility of suicidal thoughts or actions.\n\nTrazodone has been reported to cause seizures in a small number of patients who took it concurrently with medications to control seizures.\n\nWhile trazodone is not a true member of the SSRI class of antidepressants, it does still share many properties of the SSRIs, especially the possibility of discontinuation syndrome if the medication is stopped too quickly. Care must, therefore, be taken when coming off the medication, usually by a gradual process of tapering down the dose over a period of time.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and young adults. Close monitoring for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is thus recommended.\n\nSince trazodone may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery, the patient should be cautioned not to engage in such activities while impaired. Compared to the reversible MAOI antidepressant drug moclobemide, more impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone.\n\nCase reports have noted cardiac arrhythmias emerging in relation to trazodone treatment, both in patients with pre-existing mitral valve prolapse and in patients with negative personal and family histories of cardiac disease.\n\nQT prolongation has been reported with trazodone therapy. Arrhythmia identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (three to four beats) of ventricular tachycardia. Several post-marketing reports have been made of arrhythmia in trazodone-treated patients who have pre-existing cardiac disease and in some patients who did not have pre-existing cardiac disease. Until the results of prospective studies are available, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should be closely monitored, particularly for cardiac arrhythmias. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Concomitant administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nA relatively rare, but dramatic, side effect associated with trazodone is priapism, likely due to its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated that the incidence of any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150 mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Clinical reports have also described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms.\n\nRare cases of liver toxicity have been observed, possibly due to the formation of reactive metabolites.\n\nElevated prolactin concentrations have been observed in people taking trazodone.\n\nSufficient data in humans are lacking. Use should be justified by the severity of the condition to be treated.\n\nThere are reported cases of high doses of trazodone precipitating serotonin syndrome. There are also reports of patients taking multiple SSRIs with trazodone and precipitating serotonin syndrome.\n\nTrazodone appears to be relatively safer than TCAs, MAOIs, and a few of the other second-generation antidepressants in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200 mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When trazodone overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for low blood pressure, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal trazodone overdose, torsades de pointes and complete atrioventricular block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a trazodone plasma concentration of 25.4 mg/L on admission.\n\nThere is no specific antidote for trazodone. Management of overdosage should, therefore, be symptomatic and supportive. Any person suspected of having taken an overdosage should be evaluated at a hospital as soon as possible. Activated charcoal, and forced diuresis may be useful in facilitating elimination of the drug, gastric lavage has been shown to not be useful unless done during the first hour after intake.\n\nTrazodone is metabolized by CYP3A4, a liver enzyme. Inhibition of this enzyme by various other substances may delay its degradation, leading to high blood levels of trazodone. CYP3A4 may be inhibited by many other medications, herbs, and foods, and as such, trazodone may interact with these substances.\n\nTrazodone is generally described as acting as a potent serotonin 5-HT and α-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), and a weak antihistamine or histamine H receptor inverse agonist. Its 5-HT receptor antagonism and weak serotonin reuptake inhibition form the basis of its common label as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). Trazodone, both itself and via its major active metabolite \"meta\"-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), also binds to a variety of other receptors. It is an antagonist at most or all of the receptors it binds to except the 5-HT receptor, where it acts as a partial agonist similarly to buspirone and tandospirone but with comparatively greater intrinsic activity. Conversely, mCPP is a non-selective agonist of most of the serotonin receptors it binds to. A range of weak affinities (K) have been reported for trazodone at the human histamine H receptor including 220 nM, 350 nM, 500 nM, and 1,100 nM.\n\nTrazodone acts predominantly as a 5-HT receptor antagonist to mediate its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Its inhibitory effects on serotonin reuptake and 5-HT receptors are comparatively weak. Hence, trazodone does not have similar properties to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is not particularly associated with increased appetite and weight gain, unlike other 5-HT antagonists like mirtazapine. Moderate 5-HT partial agonism is likely to contribute to trazodone's antidepressant and anxiolytic actions to some extent as well.\n\nRoughly half of brain 5-HT2A receptors are blocked by 1 mg of trazodone and essentially all 5-HT2A receptors are saturated at 10 mg of trazodone, but the clinically effective hypnotic doses of trazodone are in the 25–100 mg range.\n\nThe combined actions of 5-HT and 5HT receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to high doses of trazodone. Doses of trazodone lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H and α-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia is one of the most frequent residual symptoms of depression after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a major depressive episode. Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of trazodone to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby trazodone can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants.\n\nTrazodone's potent α-adrenergic blockade may cause some side effects like orthostatic hypotension and sedation. Conversely, along with 5-HT and H receptor antagonism, it may contribute to its efficacy as a hypnotic. Trazodone lacks any affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, so does not produce anticholinergic side effects.\n\nmCPP, a non-selective serotonin receptor modulator and serotonin releasing agent, is the major active metabolite of trazodone and has been suggested to possibly play a role in its therapeutic benefits. However, scientific research has not supported this hypothesis, and mCPP may actually antagonize trazodone's efficacy as well as produce additional side effects.\n\nTrazodone is well absorbed after oral administration, with mean peak blood levels obtained at about one hour after ingestion. Absorption is somewhat delayed and enhanced by food. The drug is 89–95% protein-bound. Trazodone is extensively metabolized by the liver, with three or four major metabolites having been identified in the human body, particularly mCPP, which may contribute to the side effect profile of trazodone and which probably accounts for trazodone's serotonergic effects. Levels of trazodone are about 10-fold those of mCPP with treatment. The mean blood elimination half-life of trazodone is biphasic: the first phase's half-life is 3 to 6 hours, and the following phase's half-life is 5 to 9 hours. Metabolites are conjugated to gluconic acid or glutathione and around 70 to 75% of C-labelled trazodone was found to be excreted in the urine within 72 hours. The remaining drug and its metabolites are excreted in the faeces via biliary elimination. Less than 1% of the drug is excreted in its unchanged form.\n\nAs a consequence of the production of mCPP as a metabolite, patients administered trazodone may test positive on EMIT II urine tests for the presence of MDMA (\"ecstasy\").\n\nTrazodone is a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine that is chemically related to nefazodone and etoperidone, each of which are derivatives of it.\n\nTrazodone was developed in Italy, in the 1960s, by Angelini Research Laboratories as a second-generation antidepressant. It was developed according to the mental pain hypothesis, which was postulated from studying patients and which proposes that major depression is associated with a decreased pain threshold. In sharp contrast to most other antidepressants available at the time of its development, trazodone showed minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Trazodone was patented and marketed in many countries all over the world. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 and was the first non-tricyclic antidepressant approved in the US.\n\n\"Trazodone\" is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while \"trazodone hydrochloride\" is its , , , and .\n\nTrazodone has been marketed under a large number of brand names throughout the world. Major brand names include Desyrel (worldwide), Donaren (Brazil), Molipaxin (Ireland, United Kingdom), Oleptro (United States), Trazorel (Canada), and Trittico (worldwide).\n"}
{"id": "2326241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326241", "title": "LGBT rights in Israel", "text": "LGBT rights in Israel\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Israel are the most developed in the Middle East, and among the most tolerant in Asia. Although same-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1988, the former law against sodomy had not been enforced since a court decision in 1963. Israel became the first country in Asia to recognize unregistered cohabitation between same-sex couples, making it the first country in Asia to recognize same-sex unions in any capacity. Although same-sex marriages are not performed in the country, Israel recognizes same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation was prohibited in 1992. Same-sex couples are allowed to jointly adopt, following a landmark court decision in 2008. Previously, stepchild adoption as well limited co-guardianship rights for non-biological parents was permitted. LGBT people are also allowed to serve openly in the military.\n\nTel Aviv has frequently been referred to by publishers as one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world, famous for its annual Pride parade and gay beach, earning it the nickname \"the gay capital of the Middle East\" by \"Out\" magazine. According to LGBT travelers, it was ranked as the best gay city in 2011, despite reports of some LGBT violence during the 2000s, which were criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres. A monument dedicated to the gay victims of the Holocaust was erected in Tel Aviv in 2014. Opinion polls have found that a majority of Israelis support the legalization of same-sex marriage, as well as adoption and surrogacy rights for same-sex couples.\n\nThe State of Israel inherited the \"Buggery Act of 1533\" as part of the British Mandate's legal code. There is no known record that it was ever enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In certain cases, defendants were found guilty of \"sodomy\" (which according to Israeli law included oral sex as well), apparently by way of plea bargains: those defendants had been indicted for more serious sexual offences. It was also used as \"aggravating circumstances\" for other sexual offences. There were also several cases of soldiers tried for homosexual acts in military courts. The Attorney General decided in the early 1960s, and the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in 1963, that the law should not be applied to acts between consenting adults in private. The ban on consensual same-sex sexual acts was formally repealed by the National Legislative Assembly (Knesset) in 1988. The age of consent for both homosexual and heterosexual acts is 16 years of age.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2007, numerous rights were granted to Israeli same-sex couples.\n\nSame-sex marriage cannot legally be performed in Israel. Israeli law allows same-sex marriages performed elsewhere to be registered, but not recognized based upon a 2006 Israeli Supreme Court decision which stated \"Before we conclude, let us reemphasize what it is that we are deciding today, and what it is that we are not deciding today. We are deciding that within the context of the status of the population registry as a recorder of statistics, the registration official should register in the population register what is implied by the public certificate that is presented to him by the petitioners, according to which the petitioners are married and in view of the role of the registration official as a collector of statistical material for the purpose of managing the registry...We are not deciding that marriage between persons of the same sex is recognized in Israel; we are not recognizing a new status of such marriages; we are not adopting any position with regard to recognition in Israel of marriages between persons of the same sex that take place outside Israel (whether between Israeli residents or between persons who are not Israeli residents)\". Civil marriage doesn't exist in Israel for heterosexual couples either (except where both heterosexual spouses do not belong to any of the recognized religious communities in the country), and therefore only a marriage sanctioned by the small number of officially recognized religious authorities can take place within Israel. (This restriction forces not only same-sex couples, but also all mixed-religion heterosexual couples and any person who wishes a non-religious marriage, to marry outside the country.)\n\nThe State of Israel allows foreign partners of its homosexual citizenry to receive residency permits. The Civil Service Commission extends spousal benefits and pensions to the partners of homosexual employees. The Israeli State Attorney's Office has extended the spousal exemption from property-transfer taxes to same-sex couples. Israel's Attorney General has granted legal recognition to same-sex couples in financial and other business matters. Attorney General Meni Mazuz said the couples will be treated the same as common-law spouses, recognizing them as legal units for tax, real estate, and financial purposes. Mazuz made his decision by refusing to appeal a district court ruling in an inheritance case that recognized the legality of a same-sex union, his office said in a statement. Mazuz did differentiate, however, between recognizing same-sex unions for financial and practical purposes, as he did, and changing the law to officially sanction the unions, which would be a matter for Parliament, according to the statement.\n\nThe city of Tel Aviv recognizes unmarried couples, including gays and lesbians, as family units and grants them discounts for municipal services. Under the bylaw, unmarried couples qualify for the same discounts on daycare and the use of swimming pools, sports facilities, and other city-sponsored activities that married couples enjoy. On 29 January 2007, following a Supreme Court ruling ordering them to do so, Jerusalem registered its first same-sex couple, Avi and Binyamin Rose.\n\nIn 2010, Israel's marriage law was amended with the passage of the \"Civil Union Law for Citizens with no Religious Affiliation, 2010\", allowing an opposite-sex couple to form a civil union in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion.\n\nThere have been 5 failed legislative attempts in the Knesset to recognise same-sex unions. The first attempt was a civil marriage bill, which included provisions for same-sex marriages, introduced by Meretz. The bill was rejected in May 2012 in a 39 to 11 vote, with 70 not attending. The second and third attempts were two similar bills that would have provided for civil unions in Israel for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples; one introduced by Hatnuah, and the other by Yesh Atid. At the same time, Meretz proposed a civil marriage bill, which included provisions for same-sex marriages. On 8 July 2015, the Knesset rejected the Meretz and Yesh Atid bills, in a 39-50 vote, while Hatnuah's bill was rejected on 22 February 2016 in a 40-47 vote. In June 2018, the Knesset rejected a same-sex marriage bill introduced by The Zionist Union. The bill failed by just three votes, 39-42.\n\nAdoption by LGBT parents had only been permitted in certain restricted situations, notably when a previous connection exists between the adopting parent and the child, such as being a family member or a foster child. On 10 January 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that a lesbian couple is able to legally adopt each other's children. During the past 15 years that Tal and Avital Jarus-Hakak had lived together, they had a total of three children. The couple petitioned the Tel Aviv Family Court for the right to formally adopt each other's children in 1997, but the request was rejected because Israel's adoption law had no provisions for same-sex couples. The couple appealed. While they failed to get a favorable ruling in the Tel Aviv District Court, the Supreme Court accepted the case. Citing Article 25 of the \"Adoption of Children Law of 1981\" (; Arabic: ), the Jarus-Hakaks argued that the law allows for \"special circumstances\" for adoption when it is for the good of the child, even if the child's parents are still alive. The only condition is that the person seeking to adopt be single. The couple argued that since the state does not recognize same-sex marriage, they are single by law. They added that adoption was in the best interest of the children if one of their natural mothers should die. The Supreme Court of Israel agreed, ruling 7–2 in favor of the couple. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the couple was allowed to adopt each other's biological children on 12 February 2006. Lesbian couples can also legally gain access to IVF and assisted insemination.\n\nIn February 2008, a court ruled that same-sex couples are now permitted to adopt a child even if that child is not biologically related to either parent. This marked a watershed in granting equal rights to gay people in Israel. isRealli, the official blog of the State of Israel, frequently publishes updates on gay adoption news in Israel. The site also has a complete timeline of gay rights milestones in Israel. On 10 March 2009, the Tel Aviv Family Court ruled that former Knesset member Uzi Even and his partner, Amit Kama, could legally adopt their 30-year-old foster son, Yossi, making them the first same-sex male couple in Israel whose right of adoption was legally acknowledged.\n\nOn 28 January 2014, the Israel High Court of Justice ruled in favor of a May 2013 modification by Israel Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and stated that same-sex couples in Israel could easily adopt through surrogacy so long as the biological parent in the same-sex relationship was willing to take a paternity test or present highly convincing alternative medical and legal evidence of paternity. Prior to the 2013 modification, both a paternity test by the biological parent and a lengthy legal process by the non-biological parent were required in order for a joint adoption to take place for same-sex couples participating in surrogacy. This ruling was further enhanced in August 2016 when the Tel Aviv Family Court ruled that Israeli same-sex couples could adopt through surrogacy from individuals residing in either Israel or from other countries.\n\nIn late August 2017, the Israeli Government announced that it no longer opposes same-sex adoption and that new criteria for adoption would be enacted. Under the new criteria, the potential parents can legally adopt a child, regardless of their sexual orientation; opposite-sex and same-sex couples being given equal treatment. Previously, same-sex couples could only adopt children opposite-sex couples did not want to adopt. From 2008 to 2017, only 3 same-sex couples (out of 550 applicants) were able to adopt, compared to 1,000 opposite-sex adoptions. According to a poll conducted earlier in August 2017, 60% of Israelis supported adoption rights for same-sex couples, while 33% were against. As of 2019, however, the Justice Minister has blocked the criteria.\n\nIsraeli surrogacy law allows opposite-sex couples to sign a surrogacy agreement with a surrogate mother. In July 2018, the Knesset passed a bill expending surrogacy rights to single women, but rejected an amendment that would have included same-sex couples. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supported the amendment, but later voted against it due to objections from Orthodox groups. Subsequently, an estimated 100,000 people marched in Tel Aviv in protest. The protests also received support from multiple companies, including Apple Inc., Microsoft, Israir Airlines and many more, and an opinion poll conducted in July 2018 found that 57% of Israelis were in favour of surrogacy for same-sex couples. Despite the passage of the law, several court rulings have protected surrogacy rights for same-sex couples. In February 2020, the Israeli Supreme Court unanimously ruled that same-sex couples should be given access to surrogacy, holding that the current law harms the \"right to equality\" and gave the state one year to amend the existing legislation.\n\nIn July 2018, the Israeli High Court proposed to make it easier for children raised by same-sex couples to be registered on official documents with the names of both their parents. Under the proposal, the non-biological parent would have to send a notice to the Interior Ministry. However, the Israeli Government rejected this measure, and insisted that same-sex couples should receive a court order if they wish to register their child(ren) with both their names. In December 2018, the High Court of Justice ruled that same-sex parents have the right to be listed on their child(ren)'s birth certificates. In a landmark case, the top court ruled that the Interior Ministry cannot refuse this right based on the parent's sexual orientation. The ruling came after two gay men adopted a son, then tried to list both their names on his birth certificate, but government officials refused to do so. Supreme Court Justice Neal Hendel said in the decision: \"The principle of \"the good of the child\" argues for the recording of his entire family unit, and doesn't permit us to limit ourselves to only one of his parents in the birth certificate…. The contrast with the treatment of a child adopted by a heterosexual couple, who has the right to have both adopted parents written in a birth certificate, is a contrast that applies both to the child and to the parents... It is unreasonable for the couple to be [legally] recognized as parents but for the certificate not to give expression to that fact.\"\n\nTreatment for gender dysphoria in Israel can be paid for using the country's public health insurance system if a patient receives approval by the Committee for Sex Reassignment operating out of Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, which consists of an endocrinologist, a urologist, and a plastic surgeon and is organized by the Health Ministry. All sex reassignment surgery operations in Israel are furthermore performed by Dr. Haim Kaplan at Sheba Medical Center under this committee's approval. However, many transgender Israelis have had trouble getting approval for treatment by this committee due to their stringent opinions on gender dysphoria. Thus, many pay out of pocket for hormone replacement therapy and/or go overseas for sex reassignment surgery.\n\nA bill was introduced to the Knesset in June 2013 to eliminate gender markers on National Identity Cards.\n\nSince 2015, the Health Ministry has allowed transgender people to change legal gender without undergoing sex reassignment surgery or a sex change operation.\n\nOpenly gay, lesbian and bisexual soldiers serve without hindrance in all branches of the military. Discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual soldiers in recruitment, placement and promotion is prohibited in Israel. Harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation is also prohibited in the Israeli military. The military recognizes same-sex couples, including widows and widowers of the same sex. Soldiers are also allowed to participate in gay pride parades. The Israeli Defense Forces currently does not consider gender dysphoria to be a disqualifying condition for service. Furthermore, the IDF considers certain transition-specific medical treatment (hormone replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgery) and counseling to be medically necessary for those diagnosed with transsexualism and thus pays for said treatments. The IDF also determines gender specific army regulations (length of service, which gender to be housed with, whether they are to wear a male or female uniform, etc.) on a case-by-case basis for its transgender soldiers. However, given that Israeli law makes it difficult for its transsexuals to begin transition until they reach 18, the draft age, and does not normally allow for sex reassignment surgery to be performed before the age of 21, so far the only person who underwent surgery while serving is Shachae Erez, the first openly transgender person to become an officer. Furthermore, many draftees diagnosed with gender dysphoria can receive exemption from military service at their own request. Officially, the IDF policy does not prohibit intersex persons from service.\n\nOn 10 June 2011, the \"Law of Return\" was tested when a gay male couple, one Jewish and one Catholic, made Aliyah to Israel. This couple was the first same-sex, different-religion married couple to request joint Aliyah status, although opposite-sex married couples of opposite religions receive joint Aliyah as a matter of course. The Jewish man quickly received citizenship but the decision of citizenship for his husband was delayed by the Ministry of the Interior despite the clause in the law saying the spouse of the Jewish immigrant must also be granted citizenship. On 10 August 2011, the Ministry of the Interior granted citizenship to the non-Jewish husband as required by the \"Law of Return\". In 2014, Interior Minister Gidon Sa'ar officially decided that, according to the \"Law of Return\", Jews in same-sex relationships married abroad wishing to immigrate to Israel can do so—even if their partners are not Jewish—and both them and their partners will receive Israeli citizenship.\n\nIn December 2016, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued an instruction to Israel's Interior Ministry to consider applications for citizenship by same-sex and opposite-sex couples equally under the same terms. The same-sex spouse of an Israeli citizen will now be able to claim Israeli citizenship at the same speed as an opposite-sex spouse. Previously, same-sex couples had to wait up to seven years, and would generally only be granted permanent residency rather than citizenship. The process was far quicker for opposite-sex couples. The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed before the High Court of Justice by the Gay Fathers Association.\n\nLGBT couples in Israel have the same\npension, inheritance and medical rights as\nheterosexual couples. In 1992, legislation was passed into law to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, with some exemptions for religious organizations. In 1997, an amendment was added to the nation's \"Libel and Slander Law\". The amendment broadened the prohibition of uttering and publishing defamation and slander, motivated by the sexual orientation of a person. Moreover, the law specifies that every violent crime, motivated by sexual orientation, shall be considered a hate crime, doubling the punishment. The \"Prohibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law, 2000\" (; Arabic: ) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, among others, on the part of those who provide products, public services or operate public places.\n\nSince 2014, LGBT youth have been protected at different schools around the country.\n\nIn April 2020, the Beersheba Magistrate's Court ruled that a local print shop must compensate an LGBT rights group after it refused to print its posters. The court held that \"When their beliefs conflict with a neccessity of providing service to all in a public space, the last value holds superior\".\n\nConversion therapy has a negative effect on the lives of LGBT people, and can lead to low self-esteem, depression and suicide ideation. It commonly includes electroshock therapy, forced chemical castration, exorcism, the administration of nausea-inducing drugs, and especially talk therapy.\n\nIn October 2014, the Ministry of Health issued a statement announcing that it considers conversion therapy to \"create false impressions of scientific recognition even though there is no scientific evidence that it is at all successful. It may also cause harm to the individual.\" The Ministry created a complaints committee to investigate allegations of conversion therapy by mental health professionals. According to February 2017 reports, none of the 20 complaints filed had been dealt with by the committee. The committee is supposed to convene monthly. Several MKs, namely Yael German and Eyal Ben-Reuven, have called the committee \"dysfunctional\".\n\nIn February 2016, the Knesset rejected a bill introduced by former Health Minister Yael German that would have banned conversion therapy in Israel for minors. The bill was rejected 37-45.\n\nIn January 2019, the Israel Medical Association, which represents about 90% of all doctors in Israel, explicitly banned all its members from performing any conversion therapy on patients.\n\nIn July 2019, interim Minister of Education Rafi Peretz attracted criticism after he endorsed the pseudoscientific practice and claimed to have personally performed such therapies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Peretz's comments as unacceptable, saying they \"do not represent [his] government's position\" and that \"[he] made it clear to him that the Israeli educational system will continue to accept all Jewish children whoever they are and without any difference based on sexual orientation.\" Thousands of Israeli teachers signed a petition demanding Perez's dismissal, and more than a thousand people protested his comments in Tel Aviv and in Peretz's hometown calling for his resignation, with the presence of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Days later, Peretz backtracked from his comments, calling conversion therapy \"inappropriate,\" but added that \"individuals with a homosexual orientation have the right to receive professional help\". Following his comments, hundreds of LGBT Israelis recounted their \"painful\" and \"destructive\" experiences with conversion therapy.\n\nSeveral conversion therapy advocates and licensed professionals have moved to Israel from the United States, due to a growing number of bans on the pseudoscientific practice there. The Israel Psychological Association opposes conversion therapy.\n\nIn July 2019, an opinion published in \"Haaretz\" called for an outright legal ban on the practice.\n\nSince 1 June 2017, gay and bisexual men in Israel have been allowed to legally donate blood following a one-year deferral period. However, no deferral was in place for lesbians or bisexual women.\n\nIn January 2018, the Health Ministry approved new regulations allowing gay and bisexual men to donate blood, regardless of when they last had sex; just like for straight men.\n\n\nIsrael's Labor Party and Meretz support LGBT rights, as did the now-defunct Shinui. Under Tzipi Livni, Kadima has reached out to the LGBT community. Other minor liberal or progressive political parties support a similar platform as well, including the Greens and the Green Leaf Party. Officials from a number of parties, including Yael German of Yesh Atid, Limor Livnat of the ruling Likud-Beiteinu, and openly gay Nitzan Horowitz of Meretz, back same-sex marriage and have pledged support for LGBT causes. Representatives from other parties, including Hatnuah, Hadash and the Labor Party, have also pledged support. Minister and MK Limor Livnat, however, did state that getting the ruling Likud-Beiteinu to legislate for same-sex marriage would be difficult due to differing opinions concerning the issue within the party, but promised to do her utmost to get her party behind the issue. Ahead of the April 2019 legislative election, Yisrael Beiteinu, one of the more conservative political parties in the country, announced that its \"doors were open to everyone\" regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nOn 22 October 2002, Meretz MK Uzi Even made history by becoming the first openly gay member of the Knesset. Five more openly gay Israelis—Nitzan Horowitz, Itzik Smuli, Yorai Lahav-Hertzano, Idan Roll and Amir Ohana—have been elected to the Knesset since then. In 2019, after the April general elections, a record-breaking 5 openly gay MKs were elected. They are Itzik Smuli (Labor), Amir Ohana (Likud), Eitan Ginzburg, Idan Roll and Yorai Lahav-Hertzano (each being a member of Blue and White).\n\nIn 2018, the city of Ra'anana elected Eitan Ginzburg (he later became an MK) as mayor, making him the first openly gay mayor in Israel.\n\nIn 2019, ahead of the September legislative election, Nitzan Horowitz successfully challenged incumbent Tamar Zandberg for the leadership of Meretz, which made Meretz the first Israeli party to elect an openly gay person as its leader.\n\nIn July 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Evan Cohen, a linguist and LGBT rights activist, as the foreign media spokesperson.\n\nNevertheless, there still have been anti-gay politicians. In 1997, President Ezer Weizman compared homosexuality to alcoholism in front of high school students. This provoked major controversy, and the President received numerous calls from civil rights activists and liberal Knesset members. Shortly following, 300 people demonstrated outside of Weizman's residence, demanding his resignation. He later apologised for these statements. On 20 February 2008, Shlomo Benizri, a Knesset member from the religious Shas party, a member of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's ruling coalition, blamed earthquakes that had recently struck the Middle East on the activities of homosexuals. Benizri said in a Knesset plenary session, \"Why do earthquakes happen? ... One of the reasons is the things to which the Knesset gives legitimacy, to sodomy.\" He recommended that instead of merely reinforcing buildings to withstand earthquakes, the Government should pass legislation to outlaw \"perversions like adoptions by gay couples\". Benizri stated that, \"A cost-effective way of averting earthquake damage would be to stop passing legislation on how to encourage homosexual activity in the State of Israel, which anyways causes earthquakes.\"\n\nIn 2015, Bezalel Smotrich, a Knesset member from the Orthodox-religious Jewish Home party, referred to LGBT people as \"abnormal\", stating: \"At home, everyone can be abnormal, and people can form whatever family unit they want. But they can't make demands from me, as the state.\" In the same discussion, he told the audience, \"I am a proud homophobe\". He later apologized, and retracted his statement, saying: \"Someone shouted from the crowd, and I responded inattentively\". In July 2015, after the Jerusalem LGBT pride stabbing, Smotrich called it a \"beast parade\", and refused to retract his homophobic remarks. In August 2015, Smotrich accused LGBT organizations of controlling the media, claiming they use their control to gain public sympathy and silence those who share his conservative views. An Israeli NGO, Ometz, filed a complaint with the Knesset Ethics Committee to intervene and investigate Smotrich's comments.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Knesset marked the first LGBT rights day, but on 24 February 2016, the parties that form the governing coalition, Likud, United Torah Judaism, Shas, Kulanu, and the Jewish Home, supported by opposition members, defeated bills to recognize bereaved widowers, ban conversion therapy, recognize same-sex marriage, and train health professionals to deal with gender and sexual orientation issues.\n\nTwo days before the April 2019 legislative election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hosted a group of representatives of the LGBT community at the Prime Minister's residence for the first time in 10 years. Although the meeting was described as \"warm\" and \"good\", representatives of the LGBT community were disappointed after the meeting ended with the refusal of Netanyahu to make promises to advance pro-LGBT legislation due to the pressure of right-wing religious and ultra-Orthodox coalition parties.\n\nIn July 2019, interim Education Ministe Rafi Peretz attracted criticism from when he endorsed conversion therapy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Peretz's comments as unacceptable, saying that they \"do not represent [his] government's position\" and that \"[he] made it clear to him that the Israeli educational system will continue to accept all Jewish children whoever they are and without any difference based on sexual orientation.\" Thousands of Israeli teachers signed a petition demanding his resignation, and more than a thousand people protested his comments in Tel Aviv and in Peretz's hometown, calling for his dismissal. Days layer, Peretz backtracked from his comments, labelling conversion therapy \"inappropriate,\" but added that \"individuals with a homosexual orientation have the right to receive professional help\".\n\nIsrael has an active LGBT community, with well attended annual gay pride festivals, held in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem since 1998. Pride events are also held regularly in Haifa, Petah Tikva, Hadera, Ra'anana, Eilat, and Rishon LeZion. In 2016, the first-ever pride parade scheduled in Beersheba was cancelled by the Israeli Supreme Court due to security concerns. Israel is one of only eleven foreign countries to have a chapter of the U.S. group PFLAG, called Tehila.\n\nThe Jerusalem parade gained international coverage when three marchers were stabbed in 2005. The perpetrator was subsequently sentenced to twelve years in prison. An attempt by Jerusalem's mayor, a Haredi Jew, to thwart Jerusalem Pride in June 2005 had been challenged in the courts. The mayor lost and was ordered to contribute funds to the event. The WorldPride Festival was planned for Jerusalem in August 2005, despite protests and opposition from members of the three major religions in Jerusalem. However, it was postponed due to Israel's pullout from the Gaza Strip, which required the presence of most Israeli police forces and would thus leave the parade with little to no security. The parade had been plagued with threats of violence, as well as consistent grandstanding by some Jewish, Muslim and Christian leaders and members of the Knesset. In November 2006, more than two thousand members of the Haredi community jammed into streets in an Orthodox neighbourhood in a show of force aimed at pressuring authorities into cancelling the gay pride parade to be held in Jerusalem. About a dozen people were reported injured. Six people were stabbed in 2015. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the Hadassah Medical Center three days later, on 2 August 2015. The number of Jerusalem pride participants after the 2015 attack was smaller than in years past. In 2016, some 25,000 took part, many in solidarity with the LGBT community following the deadly stabbing attack, while in 2017, at least 22,000 marched in the parade. In 2018, at least 20,000 marched in the parade. On 6 June 2019, around 15,000 people marched at the event, under tight security with a reported 2,500 security personnel. At least 49 people who wanted to violenty disturb the event were arrested.\n\nTel Aviv Pride is one of the largest pride parades in the world. There were 200,000 participants reported in 2016. The parade is the biggest pride celebration in continental Asia, drawing more than 200,000 people in 2017, approximately 30,000 of them tourists. There were more than 250,000 participants reported in 2018, and again more than 250,000 participants in 2019.\n\nOn August 1, 2009, an unknown assailant opened fire at Tel Aviv's main LGBT youth center, the Barnoar, killing two and injuring fifteen others. The attack sent shockwaves throughout the worldwide gay community and throughout Israel, sparking an immense reaction throughout the country. Before this attack, it had only been mainly left-leaning politicians that supported the LGBT community in Israel. The issue for LGBT rights and acceptance began to slowly shift towards the center of Israel's political spectrum. This shift had slowly begun when Israel's Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni appeared at gay pride events in the months prior to the shooting. However, in the aftermath of this massacre, right-wing politicians began to publicly show their support for the gay community.\n\nOn 6 October 2016, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon announced that the Israel Government had issued an order to give a divided 10 million shekels to various governments over a two-year period to examine the nation's LGBT community for possible discriminations. A leading LGBT nonprofit called the move historic and \"Haaretz\" journalist Ilan Lior noted that it would even result in a major examination of issues such as the MSM blood transfusion restrictions.\n\nIn February 2019, in a report to President Reuven Rivlin by the LGBT association The Aguda – Israel's LGBT Task Force, it was revealed that in 2018 there had been a 54% increase in homophobic incidents compared to 2017. The report highlighted that an anti-gay incident takes place about every ten hours on average in Israel. On social networks, a homophobic comment is detected every four minutes.\n\nIn July 2019, Shlomo Amar, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, was criticised for stating that gay people cannot be religious by saying that \"They aren't religious. It would be better if they cast off their kippah and Shabbat [observance] and show their true faces.\", and advocating for the pseudoscientific practice of conversion therapy. Ne'emanei Torah Va'Avodah and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) criticised his comments. Jerusalem councilmembers Yossi Chavilov and Laura Warton called for the removal of Amar from his post as rabbi, as did openly gay politician Avi Buskila and Blue and White MK Eitan Ginzburg. Fellow Blue and White MK Yael German advised Amar to follow the example of Pope Francis in his moves to accept the LGBT community. The Jerusalem Open House association and three LGBT Jewish groups, Bat-Kol, Havruta and the Gay Religious Community, condemned his comments as well. He also caused controversy in 2016 by saying that homosexuality is an \"abomination cult\" for which the Torah prescribes the death penalty.\n\nIn July 2019, a 16-year-old teenager who lives in the Beit Dror LGBT center in Tel Aviv was stabbed several times and seriously wounded by his brother for refusing to adopt \"a religious lifestyle\". Israel Gay Youth (IGY) called the stabbing a hate crime. The condition of the victim stabilized after he underwent surgery at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Media reported that the victim and two suspects were all Muslim brothers from the Arab town of Tamra in northern Israel and that the victim was removed from his home by social services due to harassment from his family. Nearly 1,000 LGBT people and allies marched in Tel Aviv under the banner \"fighting for our lives\" to denounce violence against LGBT people in the wake of the attack. The march was attended by openly gay Blue and White MKs Eitan Ginzburg and Idan Roll, who said the party was committed to ending violence against the LGBT community, and by Meretz leader Nitzan Horowitz, Israel's first ever openly gay party leader, and Etai Pinkas-Arad, who holds the LGBT portfolio at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality. The stabbing was also condemned as a hate crime by a number of politicians, among them Nitzan Horowitz and by some Arab lawmakers, namely Meretz MK Issawi Frej, Hadash party leader Ayman Odeh, Hadash MK Aida Touma-Sliman and Balad MK Mtanes Shihadeh. Green Movement MK Stav Shaffir blamed members of the religious right for intolerance towards LGBT Israelis, to which Transport Minister Bezalel Smotrich (The Jewish Home) called her \"stupid\". Four days later, the two suspects in the stabbing turned themselves in.\n\nIn 2019, the LGBT association The Aguda – Israel's LGBT Task Force announced that gay pride events would be held in 12 locales that have never held them before. Among these are Tiberias, Beit Shemesh, Zikhron Ya'akov, Ramat Gan, Petah Tikva, Pardes Hanna-Karkur, Netanya, Yavne and Kiryat Bialik.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Ministry of Health approved a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program to prevent HIV transmission, making Israel one of the first countries to implement it. The drugs are handed out at AIDS centers in hospitals and clinics that serve the LGBT community, in addition to health fund clinics.\n\nA 2013 public opinion poll by \"Haaretz\" showed support for same-sex marriage at 59% among Israelis. A Hiddush survey made in 2016 found that 76% of Israelis supported the recognition of same-sex marriage or civil unions. The poll showed an increase in public support on this issue in Israel. A June 2017 poll found that 79% of Israelis supported legally recognising same-sex unions.\n\nSince the 1970s, there has been an active gay rights movement that has often affiliated itself with the Israeli feminist movement and various liberal and social democratic political parties. The oldest Israeli LGBT organization is The Aguda, founded in 1975.\n\nOne of the first Israeli newspapers to cover the subject of gay people was a 1962 article in the now defunct \"HaOlam HaZeh\". Taking a sensationalist tone, the newspaper warned of a \"secret underground\" movement within Israel.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Tel Aviv weekly newspaper \"HaIr\" began to publish a chronicle about an Israeli gay man, known at the time as \"Moshe\", who would later reveal himself to be Gal Uchovsky. The second major shift in how Israeli media dealt with LGBT issues came in 1991, when the Histadrut Labor Federation began to include, in its official publication, a section on LGBT social and political topics. This was followed by gradually more supportive press coverage on the Israeli LGBT community and its human rights objectives. Today, the two Israeli daily newspapers have openly gay editors and/or writers, and several LGBT-publications have come and gone.\n\nRadio stations such as Radio Tzafon and Radio Radius both have scheduled times for guests to come on the air and talk about LGBT social and political topics.\n\nSarah Schulman, a writer and professor at the City University of New York, claims Israeli government public relations campaign exploits their LGBT rights record to promote public perception of Israel as a \"modern democracy\", a \"safe and secure place for investment\", and a \"tourist destination with the sun and the sand\". In August 2011, the \"Jerusalem Post\" reported that the Foreign Ministry was promoting \"Gay Israel\" as part of its campaigns to counter the negative stereotypes that many liberal Americans and Europeans have of Israel. Critics of Israel like Jasbir Puar, an associate professor of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers University, cite the Israeli Government's comparison of gay rights in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories as an example of pinkwashing. Citing WorldPride, which Jerusalem hosted in 2006, she wrote: \"Within global gay and lesbian organising circuits, to be gay-friendly is to be modern, cosmopolitan, developed, first-world, global north, and, most significantly, democratic.\" Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, has written that the Israeli Government \"insist[s] on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIdo Aharoni, former head of the Brand Israel project, responded to such criticism saying: \"We are not trying to hide the conflict, but broaden the conversation. We want to create a sense of relevance with other communities.\" Alan Dershowitz, criminal and civil liberties lawyer, has said that the term \"pinkwashing\" is used against Israel by \"some radical gay activists\" who are anti-Semitic \"bigots\".\n\nSeveral LGBT Palestinians were reported to have been blackmailed by the Israel Defense Forces to become informants. Reports stated that Israeli intelligence pries into Palestinians' internet activity and phone calls so as to identify and blackmail LGBT people and turn them into informants against other Palestinians. According to an Israeli Intelligence Corps officer: \"If anyone interests us, we'd collect information on his or her economic situation and mental state. Then we would plan how we can perform an operation around this individual, in order to turn them into a collaborator or something of the sort.\"\n\nThe first Israeli LGBT-themed film came from openly gay director Amos Guttman and was called \"Nagu'a\" (English title \"Drifting\"). Guttman was its co-writer. The film follows a young Israeli gay man, living and working with his grandparents, who has dreams of making a film and finding true love. Guttman, who died of AIDS in 1993, would write and direct another Israeli gay-themed film titled \"Amazing Grace\" (1992). Both films are considered to be autobiographies of the director. In total, Guttman directed four films and three short films. His portrayal of Israeli gay men was dark, and his films are considered to be targeted at the LGBT community in Israel, and not to the general public.\nAnother notable Israeli director to tackle LGBT themes in films is Eytan Fox. His first film, \"Time Off\" (1990), was the second film made in Israel to focus on gay people. He has directed and written several other successful LGBT-themed films, including \"Ba'al Ba'al Lev\" (1997), \"Yossi & Jagger\" (2002), \"Walk on Water\" (2004), and \"The Bubble\" (2006). Fox was also involved in the first Israeli prime time TV drama made for a general audience which dealt extensively with LGBT-themes, \"Florentin\" (1997–2000). This was an Israeli television series about a group of post-military service, Israeli twenty-somethings living in Florentin. It was the first Israeli series to have a gay person among its major characters, and was part of a slow trend that had been unfolding in the 1990s with shows such as \"Straight and to the Point\" and \"Siton\".\n\nToday, there is more programming for an LGBT audience. In 1993, the first commercial TV network in Israel, Channel 2, went on the air. It regularly dealt with LGBT social and political topics, and, in particular, helped generate greater visibility and acceptance of transgender celebrities such as Dana International. The LGBT community in Israel was also brought to the media's attention following the winning of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 by Dana International, an Israeli transwoman. At present, LGBT people in Israel can be seen on television in a variety of shows, mostly as hosts (such as Assi Azar), contestants in reality shows or characters on soap operas.\n\nPalestinian society tends to be conservative, with families tending to see homosexuality and cross-dressing as immoral acts, deserving of condemnation. Some LGBT Palestinians have relocated to Israel, often fleeing harsh intolerance that includes physical abuse, death, or disowning. Significant expatriate groups exist in Tel Aviv and Netanya, where many live with their Israeli same-sex partners who help keep their presence in Israel hidden from the police (who would pursue them not for their sexual orientation, but for staying illegally in the country).\n\nIn 2003, Aswat was founded, which describes itself as a Palestinian lesbian support group. However, the group is headquartered in Haifa, Israel, and is geared toward Arab lesbians in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. A secret association of Aswat was founded in Ramallah in March 2007 by four gay students. The Israeli Jerusalem Open House has opened an Arab chapter called Alqaws, reaching out to gay and lesbian Palestinians. In 2008, Israel granted a gay Palestinian a residency permit to live with his Israeli partner in Tel Aviv following death threats from Palestinians regarding his homosexuality. Aswat claimed that gays are sometimes targeted by the Israeli security services and are told that they must collaborate with Israel or face being outed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2326245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326245", "title": "Tinkers Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)", "text": "Tinkers Creek (Cuyahoga River tributary)\n\nTinker's Creek, in Cuyahoga, Summit and Portage counties, is the largest tributary of the Cuyahoga River, providing about a third of its flow into Lake Erie.\n\nTinker's Creek was named after Captain Joseph Tinker, the principal boatsman of Moses Cleaveland's survey crew, who died in a boating accident while returning to New England in the fall of 1797.\n\nThousands of years ago, when the Wisconsinian Glaciation retreated, dips and valleys like Tinker's Creek Gorge Elevation: were created due to erosion in the underlying shale. The awesome, severely sloped gorge sculpted by Tinker's Creek became a National Natural Landmark in 1967. A raised viewpoint over the gorge is easily accessible from the Gorge Parkway in the Cleveland Metroparks' Bedford Reservation. The stream is sometimes run in whitewater kayaks and is arguably the most challenging creek in the state of Ohio (when there is enough water to make it runnable).\n\nThe continuous downward flow of water erodes the underlying shale faster than the harder sandstone,\ncausing sandstone outcropping collapses and features such as the 25-ft-high Great Falls of Tinker's Creek or Gates Mills Falls Elevation: , in Bedford, Ohio.\n\nTinker's Creek Aqueduct Elevation: , on the National Register of Historic Places, was built to bridge the Ohio and Erie Canal over Tinker's Creek near its confluence with the Cuyahoga River. The aqueduct and surrounding area are subject to flooding by the Cuyahoga River and Tinker's Creek.\n\nTinker's Creek Viaduct Elevation: , on the National Register of Historic Places, was a railroad trestle built to span Tinker's Creek near the Great Falls. A 510-foot-long stone archway was later built to channel the creek through the gorge, which was filled with landfill for the construction of a newer two-track railway. The top of the viaduct is still visible.\n\nTinker's Creek is the largest tributary of the Cuyahoga River, the river which flows through Cleveland and into Lake Erie. Because of its glacial history, the course of the Cuyahoga River is unusual: it rises in Geauga County, Ohio, flows southward into the city of Akron, Ohio, and then abruptly turns northward and flows into Lake Erie. Its course is shaped like a reversed \"J,\" and Tinker's Creek, entering from the east, drains almost all of the land nestled in the hook of the \"J\" that does not drain directly into the Cuyahoga.\n\nThe creek itself rises near Tinker's Creek State Park in Streetsboro, Portage County. The creek then flows through Twinsburg Township and Twinsburg in Summit County, and Glenwillow, Oakwood, Bedford Heights, Bedford, and Walton Hills in Cuyahoga County before its confluence with the Cuyahoga River in Valley View village near Independence.\n\nThe 24 municipalities within the watershed are:\n\nCuyahoga County\n\nGeauga County\n\nPortage County\n\nSummit County\n\nOrganizations\n\nTinker's Creek has eight major tributaries and countless unnamed smaller tributaries. From the headwaters moving downstream, the major tributaries are:\n\nThe walls of the Tinker's Creek valley expose four geologic layers. The youngest sediments, unconsolidated glacial till deposited on top of bedrock by the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation 12,000 years ago, occur in the upper portion of the watershed. These poorly sorted and poorly drained materials largely account for the marshes, swamps, bogs and fens that characterize the headwaters of the creek.\n\nFurther downstream, at the Great Falls, the creek plunges over a cliff of Berea sandstone composed of tiny quartz crystals cemented with clay. Berea sandstone is about 330 million years old (Mississippian), and was generated by rivers bearing sand from higher ground to the east and north and depositing it in fan-shaped deltas in an ocean.

It was released in early 2002 by Mushroom Records as second single from the album, with the exception of North America, where Interscope issued \"Breaking Up the Girl\" instead. In the years since release, \"Cherry Lips\" has become an enduring track for the band, an alternative rock LGBTQ anthem, and after almost two decades continues to resonate, being used as the home run song of the Milwaukee Brewers and in advertisement campaigns for Microsoft's Surface Go laptop tablets.\n\n\"Cherry Lips\" faltered in major markets, but was a huge hit in Italy, where it had been the sound of a prominent winter marketing campaign for Breil Stones, reaching #8 on the Italian charts. Like lead single \"Androgyny\", \"Cherry Lips\" was a success in New Zealand and Australia, where it became Garbage's biggest hit single, spending five non-consecutive weeks in the top ten. \"Cherry Lips\" was ultimately certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. \n\nAs the first Garbage single fully released in the aftermath of September 11 attacks, the band donated a percentage of the royalties generated from the sales of \"Cherry Lips\" to the International Red Cross.\n\n\"Cherry Lips\" was written and recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Written just as Garbage were about to begin mixing their third album, \"Cherry Lips\" was a late inclusion to the album. The song began as a keyboard melody, and was originally known by the working title \"Wonderjam\". While recording the song, Steve Marker played a tuba, and recorded the output of the audio being run through a wah-wah pedal. Daniel Shulman, at the end of his second set of scheduled bass sessions for the album, quickly created a sub-hook bassline for the chorus on a Sabre bass run through an Ampeg B15 amplifier. The band was happy with the bassline and used it on the final mix of \"Cherry Lips\". Manson described \"Cherry Lips\" as \"an adrenaline rush\" and \"probably the most celebratory song we've ever written\". \n\nShirley Manson wrote the lyrics based loosely around two novels she had just read, \"Sarah\" and \"The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things\", written by author Laura Albert under the pseudonym of JT LeRoy. \"I took a bit of poetic license, but I wrote it for JT. It's easily the most uplifting thing we've ever done. It sounds nothing like us; it sounds like a Shangri-Las song\", Manson explained. Like the rest of the world, Manson had believed that LeRoy had been a teenage truck-stop hustler who'd escaped the streets to become a writer. Manson exchanged emails with LeRoy over the course of the album sessions. \"I wanted to write an ode to transgender spirit, inspired by my interactions with this peculiar but emotionally generous creature I knew online as JT\", Manson later recalled. On the \"Beautiful Garbage\" sleeve notes, Manson dedicated \"Cherry Lips\" to \"The Terminator\", another alias of JT LeRoy. In 2005, LeRoy was exposed as an invention of Laura Albert in articles published by Stephen Beachy, the \"New York Times\" and \"Vanity Fair\". \"I know a lot of people felt conned in the end,\" Manson explained. \"I didn't. I just felt sad that a woman felt she would stand a better chance in the world if she was a man, that JT was 'dead' and wouldn't be part of my life anymore\". Manson still felt that the books \"remain a marvel and whoever wrote them is still a genius whether they are a man, woman or wilderbeast.\"\n\n\"We were in different headspaces every time we recorded, which is why every song is different,\" Manson later explained, \"\"Silence Is Golden\" is probably the heaviest song we've ever recorded and \"Cherry Lips\" the poppiest. They're juxtaposed right next to each other.\" When Manson recorded her lead vocal, the takes were heavily EQ'd at the tracking stage (\"lt was tracked that way for effect\", explained engineer Billy Bush, \"it sounded weirder that way!\").\n\nThe first territory to receive a \"Cherry Lips\" commercial release was Japan, where Sony Music Int'l issued a five-track CD maxi of \"Cherry Lips\" remixes on December 27, coinciding with the announcement of Garbage's upcoming tour dates in Tokyo and Osaka. In February 2002, Sony followed up the single by issuing \"Special Collection\", an exclusive extended play collecting together the international b-sides with artwork from the \"Cherry Lips\" music video.\n\nAcross Europe, PIAS Recordings issued \"Cherry Lips\" on January 7, 2002, as a four-track maxi CD, two-track CD single and as a two-track 12\" vinyl. At the end of January, in Switzerland the single debuted #95 and peaked at #85 three weeks later, before recharting at #100 for a single week at the end of February; while in Netherlands \"Cherry Lips\" debuted at #86 and climbed over three weeks to #80. In Spain, \"Cherry Lips\" reached #15 on the airplay chart, while in Belgium, the single made the Ultratip (sales and airplay) charts in both the Flanders region (at #18) and the Wallonia region (#12). In Italy, where \"Cherry Lips\" had been licensed to the Breil Stones Winter 2001/02 campaign advertisements, the single debuted at #8. \"Cherry Lips\" remained on the Italian top twenty for six weeks.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, \"Cherry Lips\" was serviced to clubs at the end of November On December 3, \"Cherry Lips\" hit radio and music TV and television advertisements for \"Beautiful Garbage\" began airing in the run up to the Christmas period, with heavy emphasis on \"Cherry Lips\". The \"Cherry Lips\" remixes peaked at #3 on the ARIA Club chart FMR scheduled the single to coincide with the Big Day Out rock festival, which Garbage were part of the line-up. The week before release, \"Beautiful Garbage\" climbed back up to #10 on the album chart, as \"Cherry Lips\" hit #2 on the airplay chart. \"Cherry Lips\" was issued to stores on January 14 as a 2×CD single set and debuted at #7 on the ARIA Singles Chart, both the second highest new entry, and Garbage's first Australian top ten single. On January 24, Garbage performed both \"Cherry Lips\" and \"Androgyny\" live on Channel V outside Fox Studios in Sydney. On the fourth week of release, the single reached #1 on the ARIA Alternative chart as \"ARIA certified \"Cherry Lips\" gold for shipments of over 35,000 units. During this period, \"Beautiful Garbage\" climbed to #5 on the album chart, staying there for three weeks. On its fifth and sixth week, the single dropped to #12, and then reversed back up to the #10 spot, ultimately spending fifteen weeks on the charts In New Zealand, the band's performance in Auckland and airplay for the single resulted in \"Beautiful Garbage\" re-charting at #12 on the RIANZ album chart. \"Cherry Lips\" debuted three weeks later at #39, before climbing to peak at #22 by the start of March. \"Beautiful Garbage\" rebounded on the album chart at the end of the month, reaching number 16 in April.\n\n\"Cherry Lips\" was originally scheduled to be issued in the United Kingdom to support Garbage's mini-tour of Europe in November 2001. The track and remixes were serviced to radio, while the commercial release was put on hold. Garbage performed the song on \"Later With Jools Holland\", MTV's \"Morning Glory\" and on Radio One's \"Evening Session\" as well as pre-recording a performance for \"Top of the Pops\". At the start of 2002, Garbage kicked off the rescheduled release of \"Cherry Lips\", performing the song on \"\", \"T4\" and on the \"Pepsi Chart Show\". Mushroom Records issued \"Cherry Lips\" to record stores on January 21 in a 12\" vinyl format and a 2×CD single set. A week later, \"Cherry Lips\" debuted at #24 on the UK Singles Chart. The single dropped to #40 after three weeks. An internet-only remix of \"Cherry Lips\" produced by Girls Against Boys bassist Eli Janney was streamed online on various sites to promote the song. On February 1, Mushroom partnered with \"The Sun\" tabloid and Asda supermarket to give away a free CD titled \"Garbage:Sampler\" that included the \"Cherry Lips\" remix. In Ireland, \"Cherry Lips\" peaked at #27 on the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nIn March 2003, \"Cherry Lips\" featured on the PlayStation 2 game \"Amplitude\". While playing the \"Cherry Lips\" level, the game shows footage taken from the \"Breaking Up the Girl\" music video. \n\nIn 2007, \"Cherry Lips\" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\". \n\nIn June 2013, the same week that Garbage's live Blu-ray/DVD \"One Mile High... Live\" was released, \"Cherry Lips\" re-charted at #89 on the UK Physical Singles chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing that the song had been inspired by the writing of JT LeRoy, director Dawn Shadforth presented a treatment for a stylized \"Cherry Lips\" video combining those sensibilities with 1960's biker movies and Japanese manga graphic novels. Shadforth envisioned the visual as a \"celebration of extraordinariness and difference\" populated by lizard people and set at an alternative universe truck stop where Garbage were the house band. Animated sequences would be cued to the guitar parts. The truck stop people would appear normal at first, but as they started to dance, hints of 'lizardness' would appear (flicking tongues, tails) with subtle prosthetics. The video would end with a hot rod race and a flying saucer, with Manson climbing on-board or the side of one of the cars. The shots were to be stylized: colourful people, cars and clothes against a starry night sky. Inside the cars, the lizard people would reveal the full extent of their real selves in strobe light shots. Despite Shadforth's music video for Kylie Minogue's \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" then saturating music channels worldwide, Interscope chose to reject the treatment; \"I feel broken hearted we never made it\" Manson later recalled.\n\nThe produced music video for \"Cherry Lips\" was directed by Joseph Kahn on a set installed in a loft located in Brooklyn, New York on October 22, 2001. The video was produced by Supermega/Palomar; collaborating on the music video were top hair artist Renato Campura, make-up artist Mathu Andersen and stylist Kithe Brewster. Visual effects were handled by Chris Watts.\n\nThe video treatment Kahn filmed featured Garbage performing in a loft space, but only seen on mirror reflections, on monitor displays or reflected in the camera lens. As the chorus begins, it becomes apparent that the band are invisible. The special effect was rendered by filming Garbage wrapped in green gauze suits under their clothing and digitally replacing their bodies with the background. The insides of their clothing were replaced using CGI. Monitors visible to the viewer were fed playback footage of the band performing 'as normal'. For the breakdown and coda, Manson removed her clothing (except her boots and gloves) and performed an invisible striptease, and then walked across the room towards a bathroom mirror displaying her composited reflection. The twist ending showed the invisible Manson urinating while standing up. Manson dyed her red hair to platinum blonde the night prior to the shoot. Kahn expressed concern over the change, as he felt Manson was strongly identified as a redhead. To complement her new colour, she was given a 1950s-era beige palette \"for a glamourous but not overdone\" look. Vig filmed all his close-up scenes at the start of the day; he had been suffering from a food poisoning infection. A stand-in was used for his greenscreen shots. The set was dressed to resemble a strip club, vintage neon signs were procured from over the city to provide an authentic backdrop.\n\nThe \"Cherry Lips\" video premiered on Australia's \"Rage\" on December 3, on MTV Europe in the United Kingdom and on VIVA in Germany on December 17. MTV Europe required an edit to the scenes where Manson stamped on lightbulbs; an alternate edit was re-serviced with the scenes obscured in early 2002. VH1 continued to broadcast the original version. The \"Cherry Lips\" video was nominated for a Bulgarian MM Music Award in the category of Best Video by an International Act. The \"Cherry Lips\" video was first made commercially available in QuickTime format on the CD-ROM enhanced section of the \"Cherry Lips\" CD singles. A remastered version of the \"Cherry Lips\" music video was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\", and made available as a digital download via online music services later the same year. The \"Cherry Lips\" video was uploaded to VEVO in 2010.\n\nManson admitted later that she regretted the Joseph Kahn video: \"We were quite literally blackmailed by our record company into making a video that we knew from the storyboard was a shockingly bad idea\", she revealed. \"We fought so hard not to do it, but we didn't hold enough cards, and so were forced to capitulate.\" Duke Erikson thought that, despite people thinking that the video was \"fun\", that it didn't do anything for the song. The band claimed that Interscope spent $1,000,000 on the \"Cherry Lips\" video, and was made under pressure from their management through to the video commissioner at their label to keep MTV interested.\n\nRemixes commissioned for the commercial single release included club and dub mixes each from Dominican/American house music DJ/producer Roger Sanchez and UK-based producers Graham Simmons and Alun Harrison (under the name MaUVe), as well as a club mix from Scottish DJ/producer Howie B. All five mixes were serviced to clubs and specialist dance radio in November 2001. A further remix was completed by Girls Against Boys member Eli Janney and released as a streaming single via the Garbage website. In 2005, Garbage remixed \"Cherry Lips\" themselves (subtitling the remix \"Le Royale mix\") for the B-side of the \"Why Do You Love Me\" DVD single. \n\nIn 2007, the Roger Sanchez remix was remastered, edited and included on the \"Absolute Garbage\" bonus disc \"Garbage Mixes\". \n\nThe Howie B remix of \"Cherry Lips\" is the home run song of the Milwaukee Brewers\n\nThe reviews for \"Cherry Lips\" upon album impact and single release were mostly positive. In early press for \"Beautiful Garbage\", \"Kerrang!\"'s Dom Lawson described it as \"lavish trashy pop\" while Will Stokes, a reviewer for \"Attitude\", wrote \"Has anything more funky than the bubble-gum flavoured \"Cherry Lips\" been written all year?\" \"Billboard\" wrote \"replete with \"Chapel of Love\" wedding-bell chimes, Garbage has created a storyline for film director Gus Van Sant.\"\n\nNot all reviews were enthusiastic. A reviewer for \"NME\" wrote, \"\"Cherry Lips\" sounds like Martine McCutcheon being told to have fun at gun-point\". while in an album review for \"Rock Sound\", referring to \"Cherry Lips\", Victoria Durham wrote \"you can't help thinking that things have veered a little off course here\"\n\n"}

It connects the Ørestad neighborhood of Copenhagen, Denmark, to the city center. The line is elevated while traveling through Ørestad, while it runs in a tunnel below the city center. From Christianshavn to Vanløse, the line is shared with M2.\n\nThe background for the metro was the urban development of the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principal of building a rail transit was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the \"Ørestad Act\". The responsibility for developing the area, as well as building and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes of transport were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit system.\n\nThe decision to build stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse was made by parliament on 21 December 1994. Stage 2 involved the establishment of the company Fredriksbergbaneselskapet I/S in February 1995, owned 70% by the Ørestad Development Corporation and 30% by Fredriksberg Municipality. In October 1996, a contract was signed with the Copenhagen Metro Construction Group (COMET) for building the lines, and with Ansaldo for delivery of the trains and operate the system the first five years. COMET is a consortium comprised Astaldi, Bachy, SAE, Ilbau, NCC Rasmussen & Schiøtz Anlæg and Tarmac Construction.\n\nConstruction started in November 1996, with the moving of underground pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, construction started at the depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline construction work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started digging each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.\n\nThe first section of tunnel was completed by September 1998, and the TBMs moved to Havnegade. By December 1998, work had started on all the initial nine stations. Plans for M2 were presented to the public in April 1999, with a debate emerging if the proposed elevated solution is the best. In May, the first trains were delivered, and trial runs began at the depot. In December, the tunnels were completed to Strandlodsvej, and the TBMs were moved to Havnegade, where they started to grind towards Frederiksberg. From 1 January 2000, the S-train service from Solbjerg to Vanløse was terminated, and work to rebuild to metro started. By February 2001, all tunnels were finished.\n\nOn 6 November 2001, the first train operates through a tunnel section. On 28 November, laying of tracks along stage 1 and stage 2A completed. An agreement about financing stage 3 was reached on 12 April. By 22 May, the 18 delivered trains had test-run . The section from Nørreport to Lergravsparken and Vesterport was opened on 19 October 2002. Initially, the system had a 12-minute headway on each of the two services. From 3 December this was reduced to 9 minutes, and from 19 December to 6 minutes. Operation of the system was subcontracted to Ansaldo, who again subcontracted it to Metro Service, a subsidiary of Serco. The contract had a duration of five years, with an option for extension for another three.\n\nTrial runs on the next section of metro, stage 2A from Nørreport to Frederiksberg, began on 24 February. It opened on 29 May 2003. All changes to bus and tin schedules in Copenhagen took place on 25 May, but to allow Queen Margrethe II to open the line, the opening needed to be adapted to her calendar. This caused four days without a bus service along the line. Stage 2B, from Frederiksberg to Vanløse, opened on 12 October. Forum Station was nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2005. In 2007, the Ørestad Development Corporation was discontinued, and the ownership of the metro was transferred to Metroselskabet I/S.\n\nM1 starts at Vanløse, where there is transfer to the S-train's lines C and H. The line starts elevated and is located in fare zone 2. The borough of Vanløse is mostly a residential area. The line then runs into the enclave municipality of Frederiksberg, running parallel to the Frederikssund Line of the S-train. At Flintholm, there is transfer to the C, F and H-lines of the S-train. Flintholm is the country's third-largest public transport hub. The station is located at the Grøndal Park, and is the borderline between the urban and suburban Copenhagen. The area around Lindevang is a redeveloped industrial area, that now is mostly residential, in addition to hosting the Copenhagen Business School.\n\nAfter Lindevang, the line dives into the tunnel that it is follows through the city center. At Fasanvej is another campus of the Copenhagen Business School. Frederiksberg serves the center of the municipality, that in addition to many public offices and cultural facilities, serves the University of Copenhagen's Frederiksberg Campus and another campus of the Copenhagen Business School. The station is located in both fare zone 1 and 2. Frederiksberg became a transfer station to M3 when the City Circle Line was opened on 29 September 2019. Forum is the last station in Frederiksberg Municipality, but located only a few blocks from the Copenhagen borough of Nørrebro. The Forum area is a residential area from the 1930s and 1940, built in functionalism, and hosts the Royal Danish Academy of Music.\n\nNørreport lies within Indre By—the city center of Copenhagen. It is the main intersection with DSB's intercity and regional trains, as well as the S-train, serving lines A, B, C, E and H. Kongens Nytorv lies at the heart of the commercial and cultural center of Copenhagen. When the City Circle Line opened, the station serves as the transfer to lines M3 and M4. Christianshavn is located on an island, a former navy base that has been redeveloped into residential and commercial mix. It is the last station served by both lines, with M1 branching off towards Islands Brygge.\n\nIslands Brygge is the first station to lay within the redeveloped area of Ørestad. Located in the borough of Amager Vest, it is located adjacent to the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Copenhagen and the IT University of Copenhagen. The station is the last located underground. DR Byen is located at the southern end of the campus. It is named for DR Byen, the headquarters of the national broadcaster DR. Copenhagen Concert Hall is located adjacent to the station. Sundby is located close to a large recreational area to the west, a residential to the east and the psychiatric division of Amager Hospital.\n\nBella Center is located in a traditional housing area, but is also adjacent to Scandinavia's largest convention center, Bella Center. Ørestad is located in the heart of the new urban development area. In addition to numerous corporate offices and educational institutions, the area hosts Field's, the Nordic Countries' largest shopping center. The metro station is located above the DSB regional Oresundtrain station, that has international services to Sweden. Vestamager is the terminus of M1. It is located close to the Kalvebod Commons.\n\nThe system operates continually (24/7) with a varying headway throughout the day. During rush hour (07–10 and 15–18), there is a four-minute headway. During Thursday through Saturday night (24–05), the headway is fifteen minutes, and other nights it is twenty minutes on all sections of the metro. At all other times, there is a six-minute headway. On the section shared with M2, there is half the headway (except during night on weekdays). Travel time along the whole line is 23 minutes, with the section from Vestamager to Nørreport taking 14 minutes and from Nørreport to Vanløse taking 9 minutes.\n\nTwo stations, one north and one south of Ørestad, are planned and will be opened when Ørestad is fully developed. They will be located approximately halfway between Bella Center and Ørestad, and Ørestad and Vestamager. Possible names are Ørestad Nord and Ørestad Syd.\n\n"}

At Flintholm, there is transfer to the C, F and H-lines of the S-train. Flintholm is the country's third-largest public transport hub. The station is located at the Grøndal Park, and is the borderline between the urban and suburban Copenhagen. The area around Lindevang is a redeveloped industrial area, which now is mostly residential, in addition to hosting the Copenhagen Business School.\nAfter Lindevang, the line dives into the tunnel that it follows through the city center. At Fasanvej there is another campus of the Copenhagen Business School. Frederiksberg serves the center of the municipality, that in addition to many public offices and cultural facilities, serves the University of Copenhagen's Frederiksberg Campus and another campus of the Copenhagen Business School. This station is located in both fare zone 1 and 2. Frederiksberg became a transfer station to M3 when the City Circle Line was opened on 29 September 2019. Forum is the last station in Frederiksberg Municipality, but located only a few blocks from the Copenhagen borough of Nørrebro. The Forum area is a residential area built during the 1930s and 1940, built in functionalism, and hosts the Royal Danish Academy of Music.\n\nNørreport lies within Indre By—the city center of Copenhagen. It is the main intersection with DSB's intercity and regional trains, as well as the S-train, serving lines A, B, C, E and H. Kongens Nytorv lies at the heart of the commercial and cultural center of Copenhagen. When the City Circle Line opened, the station serves as the transfer to lines M3 and M4. Christianshavn is located on an island, a former navy base that has been redeveloped into residential and commercial mix. It is the last station served by both lines, with M1 branching off towards Islands Brygge.\n\nAmagerbro is located in the borough of Amager Øst, and is the first station on the island of Amager. The surrounding area combines a residential area with night life and many shops. Lergravsparken is surrounded by an older, dense residential area, although it has experienced a commercial growth after the metro arrived. After Lergravsparken, the line emerges and runs on an embankment or elevated the rest of the way to the airport. The line also enters the municipality of Tårnby and passes into fare zone 3. Øresund is located in an industrial area, and is one of few stations to have no correspondence with any buses.\nAmager Strand is located from Amager Beach Park, that runs along the coast of Amager. This station also has no corresponding bus routes. Femøren is located in an industrial area, but also near the park Tiøen. Kastrup is the first station in fare zone 4. It is located in a predominately industrial area, but the area also features a marina and other aquatic leisure facilities.\n\nLufthavnen (the Airport) is the terminus of M2. It is located at Terminal 3 of Copenhagen Airport, the largest airport in the Nordic Countries and the main hub for Scandinavian Airlines, and a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle. There is also transfer to the mainline train station, which serves DSB's intercity and regional trains, and international trains to Sweden, the regional Oresundtrain and SJ's X 2000 intercity service to Stockholm.\n\nThe system operates continually (24/7) with a varying headway throughout the day. During rush hour (07–10 and 15–18), there is a four-minute headway. During Thursday through Saturday night (24–05), the headway is fifteen minutes, and other nights it is twenty minutes on all sections of the metro (M2 trains change when travelling at night on weekdays : travellers between Lufthavnen and Vanløse must change train at Christianshavn and to take the M1 line. The journey may take longer). At all other times, there is a six-minute headway. On the section shared with M1, there is half the headway (except during night on weekdays). Travel time along the whole line is 24 minutes, with the section from the airport to Nørreport taking 15 minutes and from Nørreport to Vanløse taking 9 minutes.\n\nThe line is owned by Metroselskabet and operated by Metro Service. The line uses 34 AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro vehicles that are shared with M1. The depot is located at the Service and Maintenance Center at Vestamager on M1.\n"}

The most recent Constitution of Cuba was enacted in 2019.\n\nCuban law is dedicated to advancing equality among the Cuban population, according to state sources.\n\nThe Family Code covers marriage, divorce, marital property relationships, recognition of children, obligations for children’s care and education, adoption, and tutelage. The following are Clauses 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 of the Cuban Family Code:\n\n24. Marriage is constituted on the basis of equal rights and duties of both partners. \n\n25. The spouses must share the same home, be faithful to one another, help, consider and respect each other. The rights and duties established by this code will subsist in their entirety as long as the marriage has not been legally terminated, in spite of the fact that for justifiable reasons a common household cannot be maintained. \n\n26. Both spouses are obligated to care for the family they have created and cooperate with each other in the education, formation and guidance of their children in line with the principles of socialist morality. As well, each to the extent of his or her capabilities and possibilities must participate in governing the home and cooperate toward its best possible care. \n\n27. The spouses are obligated to contribute toward satisfying the needs of faculties and economic capacities. Nevertheless, if one of the spouses contributes only through his or her work in the home and child-care, the other spouse must provide full economic support without this meaning that he or she be relieved of the obligations of cooperating with the housework and child-care. \n\n28. Both spouses have the right to exercise their professions or crafts and must lend each other reciprocal cooperation and aid to this effect, as well as in order to carry out studies or perfect their training, but in all cases they will take care to organize their home life so that such activities be coordinated with fulfillment of the obligations imposed by this code.”\n\nThe Cuban people began to discuss the Family Code in the early 1974; they wanted the Family code to become law in time for the FMC Congress. Aside of this fact, the Family Code was so important to the Cuban people that they deemed it vital to have a complete and “far reaching” discussion about it. People as young as junior high school students got enthusiastically interested in the Code, and had debates and discussions about it as the first law to have tremendous importance to their future. The plan for the discussion of the code was announced by Blas Roca at the Women’s Congress. Roca was a very active member of the Orthodox party. And by then he was Secretariat and head of the committee to draft new laws. He is now the president of the national People’s Assembly. The Family Code was very important to the Cuban people at the time of its implementation into the Cuban Law books. Like all of Cuba’s most important laws, the Family Code had been published in a tabloid edition in order for it to reach everybody in Cuba; virtually every man, woman, and young person who wanted to read and study it could have access to it. Cuban people are able to quickly master the new code in meetings through the trade unions, the CDRs, the FMC, the schools, and so on. Because most Cuban citizens attend more than one of these meetings, people take multiple advantages to learn and discuss the code until they digest all the information they need to know about it point by point. Because the government wanted to ensure the Code favors all and not some, people were encouraged at these meetings to ask questions and suggest additions, amendments, and or deletions. “The way this process works is that a record is kept of each meeting, the results are sent through the respective organizations to their highest level, where they are tabulated, computed, and turned over to the original committee (adjacent, at the time, to the party’s Central Committee, now adjacent to the National Assembly).” The Family Code was officially given to the Cuban people on March 8, 1975, which marks International Women’s Day in Cuba.\n\nCuba's criminal code was based on Spanish law until 1956\n\nControversial portions of Cuba's criminal code include vague provisions providing for the arrest of persons committing anti-revolutionary acts.\n\nCuban Criminal Code however does not cover international incidents.\n\nCuban law regarding private property has been heavily criticized as offering little to no protection to private property.\n\nIn 1992, in response to the Special Period, the Cuban constitution was changed to authorize the limited existence of joint ventures and corporations. \n\nCuba law also permits the collective ownership of agricultural cooperatives.\n\nIn 2010, Cuban leaders Fidel and Raul Castro made the decision to abandon the old Soviet model of centralized planning. In 2011, new laws where enacted to expand the right to private property. In 2019, a new Constitution was approved which officially recognizes the right to private property, while also reassuring the central government's authority over the regulation of production and land.\n\nCuba's laws provide for strong government regulation of the economy in almost all of its facets.\n\nCuba was a Colony of Spain until its independence was won in 1899, following military intervention by the United States (known in the United States as the Spanish–American War). Following the defeat of the Spanish, Cuba remained under a US military government until 1902, at which time the US oversaw the creation of a new government. The Diario de sesiones del Congreso de la Republica de Cuba (Daily sessions of the Congress of the Republic of Cuba) show how Cuban law was shaped during this period.\n\nThe influence of both United States and Spanish rule on Cuban Law were present decades into the future. For example, the Spanish Penal Code influenced the 1936 Civil Defense Code of Cuba, which remained in effect until 1979. The Spanish Civil Code of 1889 remained in effect (although modified) until 1987. The influence of the United States appeared in the form of a supreme court of appeals and judicial review.\n\nFollowing the triumph of Cuban Revolution on January 1, 1959, much of the Constitution of 1940 was reinstated. This did not fulfill the promises in the Manifesto of Montecristi, however, since Castro's government did not restore the constitution in total and failed to call elections within the 18-month period that the manifesto required. \n\nIn the aftermath of the Revolution, the Congress was supplanted by a Council of Ministers, consolidating greater power in the hands of the revolutionary government. In the years to follow, the revolutionary government enacted hundreds of laws and decrees with the aim of affecting basic change in Cuba's socio-economic system. Some of the major laws enacted include the First Agrarian Reform Law of May 1959, Urban Reform Law of October 1960, Nationalization Law of October 1960, Nationalization of Education Law of June 1961, and the Second Agrarian Reform Law of October 1963. Furthermore, new institutions, such as the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA), were created to carry out these laws more efficiently.\n\nIn February 1962, 45 Cuban Air Force officers were tried for genocide in the civilian courts and were acquitted. Their acquittal was publicly denounced by Fidel Castro as a miscarriage of justice. In response to the verdict, the Revolutionary Government established \"Revolutionary Courts,\" whose purpose was to try those accused of collaboration with the deposed Batista regime, especially those accused of torture and assassination, and those engaged in counterrevolutionary activity. These courts were criticized for their summary procedures, which limited a defendant's ability to prepare for trial, as well as procedural safeguards, such as the right to appeal a verdict of guilt. It has been noted the effect of the courts was to produce a fast, certain, and severe result. In all, hundreds of individuals were found guilty in these proceedings and subsequently executed. Hostility toward the Batista regime led to widespread acceptance of these courts by the Cuban people. Supporters of the Revolutionary Courts note that their institution may have prevented \"mob justice,\" as had been seen following other periods of revolution and social unrest.\n\nIn the early 1960s, People's Popular Courts were set up, whose goal, according to Fidel Castro, was to correct anti-social behavior \"not with sanctions, in the traditional style, but rather with measures that would have a profound educational spirit.\" First established in the rural areas of the country, there were more than 2,200 such courts by the end of the 1960s. The proceedings of these courts were opened to the public in an effort to maximize their effect. These courts were criticized for overlapping with the jurisdiction of other courts and for their inconsistent application of the law.\n\nAs the 1960s drew to a close, the most radical phase of the revolution had passed and internal counter-revolution had been suppressed. The Cuban government sought to institutionalize the Revolution. Key to this was the creation of a new legal system.\n\nIn 1973, the Cuban Council of Ministers approved a structure for the new legal system, abolishing the People's Popular Courts and the Revolutionary Courts. In the place of the old legal system, a court system was established with four levels of jurisdiction: Base, District, Provincial, and National (Supreme Court). The Supreme Court was given \"appellate jurisdiction\" over four distinct areas of law: civil/administrative, criminal, state security, and military. The reforms of 1973 also saw the end of private legal practice, and all lawyers who continued to provide legal services were required to join legal collectives, known as \"bufetes colectivos\". Also included in the reforms was the creation of \"lay judges,\" who served on the bench alongside professional judges and kept alive the popular spirit of the People's Courts. These reforms were criticized on the basis that many judges appointed to serve on these courts were incompetent and that the courts were not administered well.\n\nIn 1976, Cuba formally institutionalized the revolution with the adoption of a new Constitution, which provided the legal system be based on the principle of socialist legality. In constructing their legal system, Cuba looked to the countries of the Socialist Bloc for blueprints. The principle of socialist legality, as articulated by Cuban jurists, puts forth that the role of the law in a socialist society is to create social stability while simultaneously furthering the development of the socialist society through change in Cuban political culture. As a guiding principle, socialist legality is \"explicitly\" transformative—its stated purpose is to transform society. This transformative principle penetrates to the heart of the law and has guided the development of Cuban Law since the mid-1970s. The explicit transformative principle of socialist legality sets it apart from the civil law and the common law legal systems, whose underlying principles are based on existing statute and custom, respectively.\n\nSuccessive reforms were instituted throughout the next 30 years to increase the autonomy of \"bufetes colectivos\" and the courts, adapt the courts to changing circumstances in Cuba, and to remedy other administrative problems that plagued the legal system.\n\nIn the late 1980s, with the downfall of the Soviet Union, starting with the pulling down of the Berlin wall in 1989 and its full collapse in 1991, the laws of Cuba changed again to respond to the new conditions of the Special Period. The Constitutional amendments of 1992 recognized forms of non-socialist property (joint ventures, corporations, other economic associations) and provided for non-discrimination based on religious belief (for example, persons with religious belief may now join the Cuban Communist Party, although Cuban Priests have commented this is merely a 'token' gesture, and in reality, the ability of religious persons to join the Party is limited and fraught with difficulty). Popular participation in government was expanded with the direct election of National and Provincial assemblies. It is these changes that signify Cuba's abandonment of the Soviet legal model.\n\nIn 2002, the Constitution was again amended to make the socialist system permanent and irrevocable. This came at a time when the Varela Project called for greater political freedom in Cuba.\n\nOn April 18, 2011, the Sixth Cuban Congress approved laws expanding the internal market and access to global markets.In February 2019, voters approved a new Constitution granting right to private property and greater access to free markets, while also maintaining Cuba's status as a socialist state\n\nOn 24 February 2019, voters approved a new constitution which included reforms such as:\n\nThe Constitution was afterwards proclaimed as scheduled on 10 April 2019. After being proclaimed, the Constitution was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic, ensuring its entry into force.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was completed in 1869 and is one of the best known landmarks of Belfast.\n\nIn 1865 a competition for the design of a memorial to Queen Victoria's late Prince Consort, Prince Albert, was won by W. J. Barre, who had earlier designed Belfast's Ulster Hall. Initially Barre was not awarded his prize and the contract was secretly given to Lanyon, Lynn, and Lanyon, who had come second. Following public outcry the contract was eventually awarded to Barre. The construction cost of £2,500 (\"2011: £\") was raised by public subscription.\n\nThe sandstone memorial was constructed between 1865 and 1869 by Fitzpatrick Brothers builders and stands 113 feet tall in a mix of French and Italian Gothic styles. The base of the tower features flying buttresses with heraldic lions. A statue of the Prince in the robes of a Knight of the Garter stands on the western side of the tower and was sculpted by SF Lynn. A two tonne bell is housed in the tower and the clock was made by Francis Moore of High Street, Belfast.\n\nAs a result of being built on wooden piles on marshy, reclaimed land around the River Farset, the top of the tower leans four feet off the perpendicular. Due to this movement, some ornamental work on the belfry was removed in 1924 along with a stone canopy over the statue of the Prince. This gave rise to the expression that the tower “has the time and the inclination.”\n\nBeing situated close to the docks, the tower was once infamous for being frequented by prostitutes plying their trade with visiting sailors. However, in recent years regeneration has turned the surrounding Queen's Square and Custom's House Square into attractive, modern public spaces with trees, fountains and sculptures.\n\nThe clock was damaged in a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb explosion outside nearby River House in High Street on 6 January 1992.\n\nTo halt the worsening lean and repair damage caused by the elements and heavy passing traffic, a multimillion-pound restoration project was completed in 2002. During the project the wooden foundations were strengthened, the majority of the decaying carvings were replaced and the entire tower was cleaned.\n\nIn 1947, the film \"Odd Man Out\" was filmed partly in Belfast, with the Albert Clock as a central location, although neither the town nor the clock is explicitly identified.\n\nThis clock appears in \"Danger Man\" S3E4 \"You are not in any Trouble, Are you?\", filmed in 1965.\n\n"}
{"id": "2326287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326287", "title": "Battle of Miyajima", "text": "Battle of Miyajima\n\nThe 1555 was the only battle to be fought on the sacred island of Miyajima; the entire island is considered to be a Shinto shrine, and no birth or death is allowed on the island. Extensive purification rituals took place after the battle, to cleanse the shrine and the island of the pollution of death.\n\nThe Battle of Miyajima was the turning point in a campaign for control of the Ōuchi clan and of Aki Province, a strategically important province for establishing control of western Honshu. It was an important step for the Mōri clan in taking the foremost position in western Japan, and cemented the reputation of Mōri Motonari as a cunning strategist.\n\nIn 1551, Sue Harukata revolted against his lord Ōuchi Yoshitaka in the Tainei-ji incident, forcing him to commit seppuku. Sue installed the next lord of the clan, Ōuchi Yoshinaga, but effectively led the Ōuchi family and its armies, intent on military expansion.\n\nIn 1554, Mōri Motonari, as a vassal of the Ōuchi clan, wanted to avenge the betrayed Yoshitaka, and so he rebelled against Sue, whose territorial ambitions were depleting clan resources. The heavily outnumbered force under Mōri attacked and defeated Sue at the Battle of Oshikibata. Mōri then departed from the mainland to build a fort, known as Miyao Castle, on Miyajima while proclaiming publicly his woe that it would not hold out long against an attack.\n\nMiyao Castle was built on a hill near Itsukushima Shrine and facing the mainland, making it a visible and tempting target. Sue commandeered a fleet of merchant vessels and prepared the troops of the Ōuchi clan to cross the channel. In the early hours of 15 October, Sue attacked Miyao Castle in an amphibious frontal assault. Meanwhile, Mōri took advantage of his absence to seize Sakurao Castle, Sue's castle on the mainland.\n\nWith an embarkation point secured, Mōri Motonari continued with his elaborate plan. He had enlisted the aid of local pirates who agreed to transport his troops to Miyajima. The fleet carrying the Mōri forces set out in a driving thunderstorm. Their approach thus obscured, Motonari and two of his sons, Kikkawa Motoharu and Mōri Takamoto, landed on the east side of the island, to the rear of the Sue force. Meanwhile, Motonari's third son, Kobayakawa Takakage, sailed straight toward Miyao Castle in a feint, then retreated so he could be in a position to return the following day, his attack synchronized with the overland assault. At dawn, Takakage and his 1,500 troops landed before the small fortress, and the sound of shell trumpets signalled that all units were in position and the attack commenced. As Takakage's force rushed the front gate of Miyao Castle, Mōri and his troops hit the Ōuchi position from behind. Caught completely by surprise, many of the Ōuchi troops scattered in disarray. Hundreds tried to swim to the mainland and drowned in the attempt. Many more saw that defeat was inevitable and committed \"seppuku\". By 18 October 1555, resistance had ended at a cost of about 4,700 dead among the Ōuchi army. Sue Harukata escaped from the confines of Miyao Castle, but when he saw that escape from the island was not possible, he also committed suicide by \"seppuku\".\n\nImmediately after the battle, Mōri Motonari ordered that the bodies of the fallen troops be removed to the mainland, and then ordered that the entire battlefield be cleansed of the blood that was spilled, to the point that buildings were scrubbed, and blood-soaked soil was removed from the island. The Mōri clan later funded several construction or renovation projects on the island. The remains of Sue Harukata were transported back to the mainland and positively identified at Sakurao Castle before being accorded a funeral and burial in the cemetery of a nearby Buddhist temple in present-day Hatsukaichi city, Hiroshima Prefecture.\n\nThe Sue forces at Miyajima are estimated to have been about 20,000 to 30,000 men, and though estimates of the combined forces under Mōri Motonari range widely from 4,000 to 10,000 troops, it is clear that Mōri was heavily outnumbered. This victory brought the Mōri clan into a preeminent position in western Japan, and established their reputation for strategy and naval tactics.\n\n"}

During the time of McLaren's anti-smoking activism, Philip Morris denied that McLaren ever appeared in a Marlboro ad.

It is situated about 29 km west of the right bank of the Indus, with a railway station, 37 km north-west of Sukkur. According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, its population is 195,437\n\nAccording to a few historians the city of Shikarpur was revived during the Kalhora rule and that was what brought about a turnaround in making it the financial capital of not only South Asia but also of Central Asia. Some people think that the city was founded by Kalhoras' cousins Daudpotas --- and it was named Shikarpur because the Talpur Mirs were fond of shikar (hunting). Another school of thought believes Shikarpur was admittedly there before the shikar-loving Talpurs arrived on the scene; for another, Shikarpur has always been a trading centre, and never a hunting lodge.Some experts think that Shikarpur is really Shakaripur --- the \"town founded by the vanquisher of the Shakas\", the Scythian.\n\nShikarpur, the seat of civilisation, culture, trade and commerce acquired political and economic importance because of its strategic location on the map of Sindh, being directly accessible to those who came from Central and West Asia through the Bolan Pass. In the early 17th century this emerald city in the northern Sindh province of Pakistan became the nucleus of a historical trade center on a caravan route through the Bolan Pass into Afghanistan. Shikarpur became the core of manufactures including brass and metal goods, carpets, cotton cloth, and embroidery. Its great bazaar (covered because of the summer heat) is famous throughout Turkistan and southern Asia.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Shikarpur District.\n\nThe population of Shikarpur District was estimated to be 1,231,481 in 2017. The predominant population is Sindhi. There are significant Urdu, Baloch, Brahui, speaking communities in Shikarpur. The population is mainly Muslim with Sunni majority and significant Shia minority. There is a small Hindu minority in the city as most Hindus migrated to India after independence in 1947.\n\nShikarpur District has an area of 2640 square kilometers, divided into four \"talukas\": \nIts borders meet with districts of Larkana, Jacobabad, Khairpur & Sukkur. Two National Highways (N-65 & N-55) intersect in the city of Shikarpur, so it can well be termed as, one of the junction points of the four provinces.\n\nThe district has a total road length of 920.0 kilometers, including 125.0 kilometers of National Highways and 195.0 kilometers of Provincial Highways. It is, thus, deficient in road density (0.35 km/Km2) compared with recognized international parameters of development (1 km/Km2). During the last few years, creeping development activity has taken place and 71.0 kilometers of road, 94 schools and a number of schemes in drainage, health and other sectors have been completed, under various programs. Basically, agrarian economy of district Shikarpur is dependent upon non-perennial irrigation system, so the district is always in semi-drought conditions. The last spell of drought is particularly notable as it created heavy unemployment and unsustainable poverty, which without any doubt created serious law and order situations.\n\nThe District is bounded on the north and east by Jacobabad District in the south by Sukkur District on the west by Indus River and Larkana District.\n\nThe town consists of eight gates and one window named Lakhi-dar, Hathi-dar, Hazari-dar, Civi-dar, Karan-dar, Wagono-dar, Khanpur-dar, and Siddiqui Mari (Window).\n\nLocated in the center of the old city, Dhak Bazaar or covered market is a long, narrow street with shops on either sides. It is covered with woodwork of pure teak. It has been serving as a cool shade during the hot summers. Shikarpur along with other contemporary cities like Bukhara, Samarkand, and Istanbul at that time had a covered street market.\n\nThere are several private as well as government clinics and hospitals in Shikarpur.\n\nList of Government Hospitals:\n\nList of Private Hospitals and Clinics:\n\nThere are many schools and colleges in Shikarpur. There is a university located on sukkur road named Shaikh Ayaz Uninversity Shikarpur. Chellaram and Seetaldas College for boys and Girls College for girls. Two old Govt; High Schools now known as school No:1 and 2 government polytechnical institute shikarpur .Private schools like Indus Public High School Shikarpur, Public School and College, The city school, The Smart School, The Educator and many more with highly appropriate environment. Institutes have their own libraries but there is only one public library in Shikarpur Student from rural areas of shikarpur visit there to study.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2326317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326317", "title": "Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large", "text": "Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large\n\nKevin & Perry Go Large is a 2000 British teen comedy film based on the Harry Enfield sketch Kevin the Teenager. The film was written by Dave Cummings and Harry Enfield and directed by Ed Bye. Enfield, Kathy Burke and Louisa Rix all return to their roles after previously appearing on \"Harry Enfield's Television Programme\", later retitled \"Harry Enfield & Chums\". James Fleet replaced Stephen Moore as Kevin's father. Although the film received mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a cult following primarily due to its soundtrack.\n\nThe film begins at the beheading of Anne Boleyn, which turns out to be an erotic daydream that introduces teenage protagonist Kevin, who is having sexual fantasies when he's supposed to be doing his history homework. Kevin has tried to lose his virginity for three years. He and his best friend Perry go to a newsagent's to buy a pornographic magazine. Like all of Kevin's previous attempts at sexual exploration, this ends in failure when he sees his father and pretends to fall on the street to hide the magazine.\n\nThe boys decide they want to go to Ibiza to become DJs and get \"guaranteed sex\", but when Kevin's parents, Ray and Sheila (James Fleet and Louisa Rix), see his bad school report, they forbid the trip. But later they compromise: the boys can go if they get jobs to pay for it. The boys search fruitlessly for jobs and end up at a house party, where a popular local girl, Sharon, passes out drunk next to Kevin. Perry, seeing the two in bed together the following morning, assumes Kevin has lost his virginity and Kevin lies, saying he had sex with Sharon but gets overheard while leaving the party. In the town centre, an angry Sharon later confronts and humiliates Kevin about this, mocking him and calling him \"virgin\".\n\nKevin arrives home in misery, just in time to sign for the delivery of his dad's new credit card. He seizes the card and takes it to the bank to steal the plane fare from his dad's bank account. At the bank, he accidentally foils a bank robbery and the bank manager rewards him and Perry with a large amount of cash which the boys plan to fund the trip. \nAs a reward, Kevin's parents approve of the trip, as long as they can accompany the boys, much to Kevin's annoyance.\n\nOnce in Ibiza, the boys spot the 'girls of their dreams' Candice (Laura Fraser) and Gemma (Tabitha Wady). They also meet arrogant club DJ and record producer Eyeball Paul (Rhys Ifans) (whose nickname derives from his practice of vodka eyeballing). The boys spend the day at the beach and chat with the girls but are unsuccessful in seducing them.\n\nThat night, the boys walk down the high street filming the events around them. Kevin films a couple snogging, and they turn out to be Ray and Sheila. Kevin sulks while he and Perry hang out with Ray and Sheila, finally ending up at the club \"Amnesia\" where they dance the night away—without Candice and Gemma, who were refused entry by the doorman (Paul Whitehouse), who holds a hand-mirror to their faces and comments that they're \"ugly\" and \"offend [his] mirror.\"\n\nThe next day the boys go to Paul's and he makes them clean his house in return for his listening to their tapes. When they leave there, they spot Candice and Gemma, but again their clumsy attempts to woo them end in failure although the girls bond with the boys when realising they know Eyeball Paul and they may be able to get them into the clubs.\n\nThe boys wait outside the girl's hotel for 4 hours while the girls have a makeover, and they are admitted to Amnesia with Kevin and Perry, but yet again the boys \"strike out\" when they get vomited on by other revellers and they leave, embarrassed while the girls later meet two other attractive men in the club. \nThat night, Perry videotapes Ray and Sheila having sex. The next day, Paul listens to the boys' music as they clean his kitchen. He stumbles across the parents' sex tape and shows it to everyone. Kevin angrily ends his friendship with Perry when he realized that it was Perry who filmed them. Baz, Paul's manager and chauffeur driver later persuades Paul to give the video back to the boys.\n\nKevin spends the rest of the day sulking around alone and becomes dejected when he sees the girls with the two other men from the club. \nPerry spends the day at the beach where he bumps into the girls and the two men who are revealed to be gay lovers who the girls had befriended. Gemma reveals she is attracted to Perry and Candice admits to liking Kevin. Perry then runs into Eyeball Paul, who says he likes their song and he'll play it in the club that night. Perry hurries to tell Kevin the good news and the friends reconcile.\n\nThat night they and the girls go to the club again in Paul's limousine. Their track is played, but the boys and Ray and Sheila, who had wanted to visit the club, are embarrassed to find that Paul has incorporated the sex tape and the boy's love messages to the girls into the track in an attempt to humiliate the boys.\n\nNevertheless, this backfires on Paul when the track becomes an instant club favourite and the entire crowd, including the girls, love the boys and their mix. Paul is unhappy at the boys' success and turns off the track, which angers the crowd. \nPaul becomes annoyed and attempts to destroy the boy's vinyl record but is stopped by Baz. Paul fires Baz who quickly punches and pushes Paul off stage before returning the record to the boys to continue the set and the crowd continue to party.\n\nKevin and Perry take over as DJs and keep the club dancing through the night. Early the next morning, Kevin and Perry finally have sex with Candice and Gemma respectively, on a beach surrounded by other similarly-involved couples having sex.\n\nIn the Epilogue, the girls become the boy's girlfriends while Kevin and Perry are seen signing copies of their record in a music shop with Baz as their new manager while Kevin's parents sign copies of their videos about better mid-marriage sexual intimacy.\n\nEnfield used popular dance music tracks from the era:\n\nDJ Judge Jules created the mix that Kevin and Perry create in the film, \"Big Girl\", which was subsequently released as a single credited to the Precocious Brats with Kevin And Perry. It was in the top 40 for 4 weeks in 2000, and reached #16 in the UK Singles Charts.\n\n\"Straight to Hell\" by The Clash features at the beginning of the film when Kevin begins banging his head on the bedroom wall; the camera pans out to view the street, in which the film title appears. All of the cars are Ford Focuses, and all of the people shown outside are wearing red baseball caps and using Flymo lawnmowers.\n\nIn the film, Eyeball Paul is a wealthy and very successful DJ; however, actor Rhys Ifans admits he is a terrible DJ, but thanks to \"the magic of film\" he'll \"look pretty sharp out there\".\n\nThe Ibiza club Amnesia makes an appearance in the film. However, the front view of the club, as shown in the film, is not the same as the actual Amnesia. The DJ booth that Eyeball Paul uses in the film is not the actual booth of the club, which is sited above the giant \"spectrum analyser\", seen in the film to the right of the fictitious booth. The Harlequin Shopping Centre in Watford was also used. Freemans Close in the small village of Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire was used for the location of the Patterson's house. Ibiza Airport was briefly used; however, the footage of a Virgin Sun Airlines plane landing was actually filmed at El Altet airport in Alicante.\n\nKevin and Perry and Kevin's parents' apartment is in Santa Eulària des Riu in Ibiza. The beach that the boys go to is Cala Benirras on the western shore north of San Antonio. \nThe buying of the indecent magazine was done in the high street of Shepperton.\n\nThe opening sequence where Kevin dreams of saving Anne Boleyn from execution was filmed at Dover Castle.\n\nHarry Enfield suspected that the \"two uses\" of the word \"fuck\" (there were actually three, all by Rhys Ifans) were the cause of the film's BBFC rating being a 15, rather than a targeted 12. He revealed in the film's audio commentary that the 15 rating was given because of a scene where a group of men took drugs. According to BBFC guidelines, scenes of drug-taking often breach the rules of a 12-rated film.\n\n\"Kevin & Perry Go Large\" was the top-grossing film at the British box office over the Easter weekend of 2000, taking £2 million and ranking as the number one film in the UK. The next week the film was knocked off the top spot by \"Scream 3\", but it regained its number one position the week after, in a week in which box office revenues were down due to warm weather.\n\n\"Kevin & Perry Go Large\" was generally given mixed reviews by critics and overwhelmingly positive reviews by fans. Although it has a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes, this is only from a sample of six reviews. \"The Guardian\" said the film was inferior to \"the wave of American gross-out comedies,\" but noted that \"Enfield himself can raise a laugh simply by throwing his arms around and moaning—as he frequently does—'I'm not your slave!'\" \"Empire\" rated the film 3 out of 5 stars. \"Radio Times\" also gave the film 3 stars out of 5, whilst the BBC rated the film 4 stars out of 5. Mark Sinker of the British Film Institute reviewed the film, saying \"\"Go Large\" is an amiable roll through vomit, poo and erections, public-humiliation and hating-your-parents gags, working through the most obvious permutations and a scatter of clever ones. Fans of Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke's characters get pretty much what they are after. Their foray beyond the television-skit format of \"Harry Enfield and Chums\" cheerfully enters the revolting world of Farrelly Brothers' humour.\"\n\nSince the film's release it has gone on to earn cult status amongst many clubbers across the UK and Ireland, largely for its soundtrack, humour, performances from Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke and its references to rave culture.\n\n"}

Pell has reportedly now 'retired' from this activity and makes his living as a media law expert.\n\nAn adherent of Orthodox Judaism who was once a trainee lawyer, he (initially) failed his law exams at University College London in 1986 which he was expected to pass. He later gained a third-class degree, but could not gain employment with a law firm. Pell pretended to be following a legal career for eight months until his family discovered the truth.\n\nPell began his activities in uncovering discarded newsworthy documents, classified as theft, around 1997. The documents he found have been involved in several court cases and led to many newspaper stories, including ones involving Elton John, All Saints and the 'cash for questions' libel case between Mohamed Al-Fayed and Neil Hamilton. He said in 2002, \"I was never interested in the political stuff. I was a showbiz animal, and my showbiz stuff was top quality. [...] You'd get more money for a little nib about Hear'Say than you'd get for anything about Gordon Brown and David Blunkett.\" In the case of Elton John, Pell had hacked into the computers of organisations connected with the singer and looked through the rubbish of John Reid Enterprises, the company of his former manager. Piers Morgan at the Leveson Inquiry in 2011 admitted buying documents for stories from Pell while editor of the \"Daily Mirror\", including Elton John's discarded bank statements, and said that such behaviour was on the \"cusp of [the] unethical\". Pell's activity was referred to as \"binology\".\n\nPell was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary \"Scandal in the Bins\" (2000) produced by Victor Lewis-Smith. Another documentary—reportedly in production at around the same time—produced by Iain Jones, led Pell to claim in 2001 that John Mappin had fraudulently misrepresented his claim to be able to make a movie about Pell, and had \"hoodwinked\" him out of nearly £80,000. The following year Pell successfully sued Mappin, whose family founded the Mappin & Webb jewellery firm, and recovered his £77,750; Mappin had said he could commission a \"well-connected Hollywood film-maker\", but Jones had turned out to be a hairdresser. The court ordered Mappin to pay Pell's legal costs and interest on the money he had been given. According to an interview Pell gave at this time, he ended his regular bin-searching activity in February 2001.\n\nIn 2003, he won damages of £125,000 in an out-of-court settlement from the \"Sunday Express\", which had falsely accused him of providing the IRA with information, and slander against Mark Watts, the journalist who had verbally accused him of the same act. Watts wrote a book about Pell titled \"The Fleet Street Sewer Rat\", published in 2005. He has been prosecuted himself and was only fined £20, due to his claim that he lived off a weekly £10 payment from his father despite the estimated £100,000 a year he was earning from selling documents to newspapers. He has asserted that it was about £25,000. He was mentioned regularly in \"Private Eye\", which nicknamed him 'Benji the Binman'.\n\nBenjamin Pell was regularly found during the 2000s in the Royal Courts of Justice taking notes on libel trials, in which he has a particular interest, and is well known to the Queen's Bench jurists. From June 2017, following the Grenfell Tower fire he took an active interest in the issue of unsafe cladding on high-rise tower blocks, affecting 500,000 residents in the UK, using the tribunal system to complain about issues with the building in Slough where he lives.\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees and St. Louis Browns between 1916 and 1928.\n\nShocker, known as one of the last legal spitball pitchers, led the American League (AL)—and set the Browns record—in 1921 with 27 wins, and won at least 20 games 4 seasons in a row from 1920 to 1923. At the time of his retirement he was the Browns all-time leader in wins with 126 and shutouts with 23.\n\nShocker was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Anna and William Shockor and relocated to Michigan some time later. Shocker began his career in the Border League where he played as a catcher. In 1913, when he played for the Windsor team in the Border League, he broke one of his fingers on his right hand; when the finger healed it became hooked which allowed him to throw a breaking ball as well as his spitter. As a prelude to his major league career, Shocker was demoted by the Yankees for seasoning and improvement, and he spent most of the 1916 season playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) in the International League, where he posted a marvelous 15–3 record and strung together 54 consecutive scoreless innings. His scoreless inning streak and 1.31 ERA for the campaign both still stand as International League records. He was called up by the Yankees and played with them through the 1917 season. That winter, Miller Huggins engineered a trade of Shocker to the Browns which he very much came to regret. However, Shocker rejoined Huggins and the Yankees in 1925. In March 1918 his draft number came up and he reported for service on May 31 of that year. After he served overseas he returned to the Browns in April 1919.\n\nThe right-handed hurler had four consecutive 20-win seasons with the Browns in the early 1920s, during which he was one of the dominant pitchers in baseball. Urban was the last Yankees pitcher to legally throw a spitball, as he and a handful of other pitchers were grandfathered to continue the practice after it was banned by baseball in 1920.\n\nShocker lived with a heart condition so severe some books say he had to sleep either sitting or standing up. By the early fall of 1927, he was too ill to maintain his place in the starting lineup.\n\nHis career totals for 412 games include a 187–117 record, a .615 winning percentage, 317 games started, 200 complete games, 28 shutouts, 72 games finished, 25 saves, and an ERA of 3.17 in 2,681.2 innings pitched. He compiled a career .209 batting average (167-798) with 89 runs scored and 70 RBI. He was a good fielding pitcher in his era, committing only 15 errors in 769 total chances for a .980 fielding percentage.\n\nAfter his release from the Yankees in 1928, Shocker entered an exhibition tournament in Denver. He pitched in one game on August 6, 1928 against a team from Cheyenne, Wyoming and fared poorly in that outing.\n\nAround this time, he contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized shortly thereafter. On September 9, 1928 Shocker died in Denver as the result of heart failure exacerbated by the disease.\n\n\n\n"}

They are often organised into religious orders. They are distinguished from clerics regular, a later form of religious life where members also live life under a rule, in that canons regular emphasise a life lived in community. Examples of religious orders of canons regular include the Crosiers, Premonstratensians, and some Augustinians.\n\nAll canons regular are to be distinguished from secular canons who belong to a community of priests attached to a church but do not take vows or live in common under a Rule. \n\nAmong canons regular most, but not all, have followed the Rule of St. Augustine and thus have been called \"Augustinian Canons\", known sometimes in English as \"Austin Canons\" or \"Black Canons\", from their black habits.\n\nHowever, one particular group of canons regular who also follow the Rule of St. Augustine are the \"Premonstratensians\" or \"Norbertines\", sometimes called in English \"White Canons\", from their white habits.\n\nCanons regular live together in community. The first communities of canons took vows of common property and stability. As a later development, they now usually take the three vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience though some Orders or congregations of canons regular have retained the vow of stability.\n\nWhen, in and after the 11th century, the various congregations of canons regular were formed, and adopted the Rule of St. Augustine, they were usually called \"Canonici Regulares Ordinis S. Augustini Congregationis\", and in England \"Austin Canons\" or \"Black Canons\", but there have always been canons regular who never adopted the Rule of St. Augustine. In a word, canons regular may be considered as the genus, and Austin Canons as the species; or all Austin Canons are canons regular, but not all canons regular are Austin Canons.\n\nBy 1125 hundreds of communities of canons had sprung up in Western Europe. Usually they were quite independent of one another, and varied in their ministries. One obvious place where a group of priests was required was within a cathedral, where there were many Masses to celebrate and the Divine Office to be prayed together in community. Canons often came to be associated with cathedrals, but other groups of canons also established themselves in smaller centres.\n\nAll the different varieties of canons regular are to be distinguished not only from secular canons but also from: \n\n\nWriting at a time before the foundation of the mendicant orders (friars), Pope Urban II (died 1099), said there were two forms of religious life: the monastic (like the Benedictines and Cistercians) and the canonical (like the Augustinian Canons). He likened the monks to the role of Mary, and the canons to that of her sister, Martha.\n\n\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, a canon regular is essentially a religious cleric; \"The Order of Canons Regular is necessarily constituted by religious clerics, because they are essentially destined to those works which relate to the Divine mysteries, whereas it is not so with the monastic Orders.\" This is what constitutes a canon regular and what distinguishes him from a monk. The clerical state is essential to the Order of Canons Regular, whereas it is only accidental to the Monastic Order. Erasmus, himself a canon regular, declared that the canons regular are a \"median point\" between the monks and the secular clergy. The outer appearance and observances of the canons regular can seem very similar to those of the monks. This is because the various reforms borrowed certain practices from the monks for the use of the canons.\n\nAccording to St. Augustine, a canon regular professes two things, \"sanctitatem et clericatum\". He lives in community, he leads the life of a religious, he sings the praises of God by the daily recitation of the Divine Office in choir; but at the same time, at the bidding of his superiors, he is prepared to follow the example of the Apostles by preaching, teaching, and the administration of the sacraments, or by giving hospitality to pilgrims and travellers, and tending the sick. St. Augustine’s teaching and example has become the heritage of the Church as it sets about bringing to life again the common life of clerics.\n\nThe canons regular do not confine themselves exclusively to canonical functions. They also give hospitality to pilgrims and travelers on the Great St. Bernard and on the Simplon, and in former times the hospitals of St. Bartholomew's Smithfield, in London, of S. Spirito, in Rome, of Lochleven, Monymusk and St. Andrew's, in Scotland, and others like them, were all served by canons regular. Many congregations of canons worked among the poor, the lepers, and the infirm. The clerics established by St. Patrick in Ireland had a Guest House for pilgrims and the sick whom they tended by day and by night. And the rule given by Chrodegang to his canons enjoined that a hospital should be near their house that they might tend the sick.\n\nSt. Augustine of Hippo did not found the order of canons regular, not even those who are called Austin Canons. There were canons regular before St. Augustine. Although Augustine of Hippo is regarded by the canons as their founder, Vincent of Beauvais, Sigebert, and Peter of Cluny all state that the canonical order traces back its origin to the earliest ages of the Church. In the first centuries after Christ, priests lived with the bishop and carried out the liturgy and sacraments in the cathedral church. While each could own his own property, they lived together and shared common meals and a common dormitory.\n\nFrom the 4th to the middle of the 11th century, the communities of canons were established exclusively by bishops. The oldest form of canonical life was known as \"Ordo Antiquus\". The first who successfully united the clerical state with the monastic observance was St Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli. This way of living was also established by St Zeno, Bishop of Verona, and St. Ambrose at Milan.\n\nIt was under St Augustine that the \"canonical life\" reached its apotheosis. None of the holy fathers were as enthusiastic about and enthralled by the community life of the Apostolic Church of Jerusalem (Acts 4:31-35) as St. Augustine. To live this out in the midst of like-minded confreres was the goal of his monastic foundations in Thagaste, in the \"Garden Monastery\" at Hippo and at his bishop’s house. The \"rules\" of St. Augustine intended to help put the \"vita apostolica\" into effect for the circumstances of his time and the community of his day.\nFrom the time of his elevation to the episcopal see in 395 AD, he changed his episcopal palace into a monastery for clerics and established the essential characteristics-the common life with renunciation of private property, chastity, obedience, the liturgical life and the care of souls: to these can be added two other characteristics typically Augustinian—a close bond of brotherly affection and a wise moderation in all things. This spirit permeates the whole of the so-called Rule of St Augustine which at least in substance can be attributed to the Doctor of Africa.\n\nThe invasion of Africa by the Vandals destroyed the Augustinian foundation but we can deduce it as almost certain that it took refuge in Gaul. The regulations which St. Austin had given to the clerics who lived with him soon spread and were adopted by other religious communities of canons regular not only in Africa, but in Italy, in France and elsewhere. Pope Gelasius, about the year 492, re-established the regular life in the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran. From there the reform spread till at length the Rule was universally adopted by almost all the canons regular.\n\nOver time there crept in the abuses in clerical life of concubinage and independent living with the scandals and disedification of the faithful which followed. Vigorous reforms were undertaken at the time of the emperor Charlemagne (AD 800). Important milestones for the Ordo Antiquus form of canonical life include the reform and rule of the Benedictine Bishop of Metz, Chrodegang (763), and the Synods of Aachen (816–819), which gave a rule of life for canons in the Carolingian Empire.\n\nThe ecclesiastical constitution or ordinance of Chrodegang, \"Regula vitæ communis\" (Rule of Common Life) was at once a restoration and an adaptation of the Rule of St. Augustine, and its chief provisions were that the ecclesiastics who adopted it had to live in common under the episcopal roof, recite common prayers, perform a certain amount of manual labour, keep silence at certain times, and go to confession twice a year. They did not take the vow of poverty and they could hold a life interest in property. Twice a day they met to hear a chapter from the rule of their founder, hence the meeting itself was soon called \"chapter\". This discipline was also recommended shortly after by the Councils of Aix-la-Chapelle (789) and Mainz (813).\n\nIn 816 the Institutio canonicorum Aquisgranensis was drawn up at the Council of Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle). This included a rule of 147 articles, known as the Rule of Aix, to be applied to all canons. These statues were held as binding. The principal difference between Chrodegang's rule and that of Aix was their attitude toward private property. While both permitted the canons to hold and dispose of property as they saw fit, Chrodegang counseled a renunciation of private property, while the Synod of Aachen did not since it was not part of the tradition of the canons. From this period dates the daily recitation by the canons of the Divine Office or canonical hours.\n\nIn the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, laxity crept in; community life was no longer strictly observed; the sources of revenue were divided, and the portions allocated to the individual canons. This soon led to differences of income, consequently to avarice, covetousness, and the partial destruction of the canonical life.\n\nIn the 11th century the canonical order was reformed and renewed, chiefly owing to the efforts of Hildebrand (c. 1020-1085), later Pope Gregory VII, culminating in the Lateran Synod of 1059. Here for the first time the Apostolic See officially recognized and approved the life of the religious clergy, which had been founded by bishops and others. Gregory VII's reformation resulted in a distinction being made between the clerics who lived in separate houses and those who still preserved the old discipline.\n\nToward the end of the 11th century, the more cathedral and other chapters of canons opted for the vita apostolica after the example of St. Augustine, the more urgent became a separation and decision, first vis-à-vis those canons, who held to private ownership, but also vis-à-vis Benedictine monasticism, which till then was the mainstay of the Gregorian Reform. Pope Urban II deserves the credit for having recognized the way of life of the \"canonici regulares\" as sharply distinguished from the principles of the \"canonici saeculares\", and at the same time as an equal way of communal perfection apart from monasticism. In numerous privileges for reformed houses of canons he clearly emphasized the nature and goal, the rights and duties of the canons regular. Thus from the renewal of the vita canonica there inevitably arose a new \"order\"—which initially had not been the intention. In the privileges of Pope Urban II we find officially for the first time the new name \"Canonici secundum regulam sancti Augustini viventes\", which would give the new ordo of canonical life a distinctive stamp.\n\nThe norm of life of the canons regular was concretized from the last third of the 11th century by a general following of the \"vita apostolica\" and the \"vita communis\" of the early church based more and more on the regulations handed on by Augustine. Secundum regulam Augustini vivere, first employed in Rheims in 1067, signified a life according to the example of Augustine that was known from his numerous writings.\n\nFrom that time the Order of Canons Regular of Saint Augustine, as it was already beginning to be called, increased rapidly. A great number of congregations of canons regular sprang into existence, each with its own distinctive constitutions, grounded on the Rule of St. Augustine and the statutes which Blessed Peter de Honestis, about the year 1100, gave to his canons at Ravenna. In some houses the canonical life was combined with hospitality to travelers, nursing the sick and other charitable works. Often a number of houses were grouped together in a congregation. One of the most famous houses was the Abbey of Saint Victor, founded in Paris in 1108, celebrated for its liturgy, pastoral work and spirituality. Also worth mention are the Abbey of Saint Maurice of Agaune, the Hospice of Saint Bernard of Mont Joux in Switzerland, and the Austrian Abbeys.\n\nThe high point of the canons regular can be situated in the first half of the 12th century. During this time they contributed not only a series of popes – Honorius II, Innocent II, Lucius II, as well as Hadrian IV shortly after mid-century and finally Gregory VIII in the second half of the century – but they also gave inestimable momentum for the area of the German Empire.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, some cathedrals were given over to the care of the regular canons, as were certain places of pilgrimage. The shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham in England was just such a shrine, and the cathedrals of Saint John Lateran in Rome, Salzburg and Gurk in Austria, Toledo and Saragossa in Spain, St. Andrew’s in Scotland, were among many others to be reformed by the regular canons. The canons also took a leading role in the intellectual life of the Church by founding cathedral and collegiate schools throughout Europe. For example, the University of Paris finds part of its ancestry in the famous Abbey school of St. Victor.\n\nLater, congregations properly so called, governed by a superior general, were established within the order so as to maintain their common observances. Among these congregations, which gave new life to the order, were the Windesheim Congregation, whose spirituality (known as the \"devotio moderna\") had a wide influence. During the 15th and 16th centuries the Lateran Congregation added to the Order’s luster by its spirituality and scholarship. In the 17th and 18th centuries the French Congregation of Saint Genevieve and later the Congregation of Our Savior founded by Saint Peter Fourier (1566-1640), responded to new needs by combining the religious life with pastoral work. Finally, in the 19th century Adrien Grea (1828-1917), founder of the Congregation of the Immaculate Conception, in his writing put in its proper perspective the ecclesial dimension of the canonical life.\n\nThe canons regular were more similar to the Benedictines in their independence and their local character. Another similarity is that, aside from a few congregations, the canons regular maintained and still maintain the vow of stability to a particular house. The individual houses often have differences in the form of the habit, even within the same congregation.\n\nAlready in the Middle Ages canons regular were engaged in missionary work. Saint Vicelin (c. 1090 – 1154) took the gospel to the pagan Slavs of Lower Germany; his disciple Meinhard (died 1196) evangelized the people of eastern Livonia. In the 16th century the Portuguese Congregation of Saint John the Baptist took the good news of salvation to the Congo, Ethiopia and India. At the general chapter of the Lateran Congregation held at Ravenna in 1558, at the request of many Spanish canons, Don Francis de Agala, a professed canon regular from Spain, who for some ten years had already laboured in the newly discovered country, was created vicar-general in America, with powers to gather into communities all the members of the canonical institute who were then dispersed in those parts, and the obligation to report to the authorities of the order. From the 19th century onwards, the order has definitely undertaken the work of evangelization.\n\nBy the 13th century, there was universal adherence to the Rule of St. Augustine. This acceptance of Augustine's rule occurred over the 11th and 12th centuries in piecemeal fashion. There were in fact three different rules of St. Augustine from which to choose:\n\n\nOf all the new monastic and religious groups to settle in the British Isles in the course of the 12th century the regular canons, known as the \"Black Canons\", were the most prolific. At the heart of their existence was the vita apostolica, but even more than other such groups the regular canons became involved in active spiritual care of their communities. Perhaps as a result of this feature they also enjoyed sustained support from founders, patrons and benefactors, and new foundations continued to be made long after the main force of the expansion of the monastic orders had declined.\n\nIn England, in the 12th century there was a great revival in the canonical order on account of various congregations newly found in France, Italy and the Low countries, and it was some of these new canons that came with the Conqueror. In England alone, from the Conquest to the death of Henry II Plantagenet, no fewer than fifty-four houses were founded where the canons regular were established. The first foundation was Colchester in 1096, followed by Holy Trinity, Aldgate, established by Queen Maud, in 1108. Andrew of St. Victor served as abbot of the newly founded abbey at Wigmore beginning in 1147. The first General Chapter of the Augustinian Canons in England, intended to regulate the affairs of the Order, took place in 1217.\n\nIn the 12th century the Canons Regular of the Lateran established a priory in Bodmin. This became the largest religious house in Cornwall. The priory was suppressed on 27 February 1538. In England houses of canons were more numerous than Benedictine houses. The Black Death left the canons regular fairly decimated, and they never quite recovered. Between 1538 and 1540, the canonical houses were suppressed, and the religious dispersed, persecuted, little by little disappeared from the land altogether. Abbot Gasquet's computation ninety-one houses belonging to the canons regular were suppressed or surrendered at the time of the Reformation.\n\nThe canonical order was in the early 20th century represented in England by Premonstratensians at Crowley, Manchester, Spalding and Storrington; the Canons Regular of the Lateran Congregation at Bodmin, Truro, St Ives, and Newquay, in Cornwall; at Spettisbury and Swanage, in Dorsetshire; at Stroud Green and Eltham, in London; the Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception at Epping, Harlow, and Milton Keynes. Besides the occupations of the regular life at home and the public recitation of the Divine Office in choir, they are chiefly employed in serving parishes, preaching retreats, supplying for priests who ask their service, and hearing confessions, either as ordinary or extraordinary confessors to convents or other religious communities.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, anno 565, relates that Columba, \"Masspreost\" (Mass-Priest), \"came to the Picts to convert them to Christ\". Columba was the disciple of St. Finnian, who was a follower of St. Patrick; both then had learned and embraced the regular life which the great Apostle had established in Ireland. Tradition places the first landing of Columba on leaving Ireland at Oronsay, and Fordun (Bower) notices the island as \"Hornsey, ubi est monasterium nigrorum Canonicorum, quod fundavit S. Columba\" (where is the monastery of Black Canons which St. Columba founded). According to Smith and Ratcliff there was a homogeneity among the Augustinian houses in Scotland before 1215 which had much to do with David I who gave them a common economic policy, and Bishop Robert of St Andrews who had himself been an Augustinian and united the houses through his patronage and by engaging them as his advisors.\n\nAt the time of the Reformation the chief houses were:\nMany of the houses founded by St. Columba remained in possession of the canons till the Reformation, including Oronsay and Crusay.\n\nThe Augustinian canons regular established 116 religious houses in Ireland in the period of church reform early in the 12th century. The role of the Augustinian Canons within the secular community was the main reason for their being the largest single order in Ireland. The canons regular were less rigorous in their observances than the Cistercians, and through this more flexible approach to religious life they participated in a great variety of pastoral activities in parishes, hospitals and schools. The Rule of Augustine was appropriate to the new monastic reforms and the pastoral activities were a significant instrument for the restoration of religious discipline which had seriously declined in Irish monasteries. St Malachy, archbishop of Armagh, was a prime mover in the reform movement in the Irish church in the 12th century and by the time of his death in 1148, there were forty-one Augustinian houses.\n\nIt is not improbable that at the outbreak of the dissolution by Henry VIII, some of the Irish canons may have retired to foreign monasteries. By 1646 the canons were sufficiently numerous to be formed by Innocent X into a separate \"Congregation of St. Patrick\", which the pope declared to inherit all the rights, privileges and possessions of the old Irish canons. In the year 1698 the Irish Congregation, by a Bull of Innocent XII, was affiliated and aggregated to the Lateran Congregation.\n\nThe Canons Regular of Saint Augustine (C.R.S.A. or Can.Reg.), also referred to as \"Augustinian Canons\" or \"Austin Canons\" ('Austin' being an anglicisation of 'Augustine'), is one of the oldest Latin Rite Orders. In contrast to many other orders of the Catholic Church, Augustinian Canons (Canons Regular of St. Augustine, Canonici Regulares Sancti Augustini, CRSA) cannot be traced back to an individual founder or to a particular founding group. They are more the result of a process that lasted for centuries. Because of their manifold roots they have undergone various forms in medieval and modern Europe. Since the 12th century, canons regular have been known as Augustinian or Austin Canons, taking their name from St Augustine, the great Doctor of the Church, \"for he realized in an ideal way the common life of the Clergy\". From that time the Canons have adopted the \"Rule\" of Augustine.\n\nOn 4 May 1959 Pope John XXIII founded the Confederation of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine with his apostolic letter \"Caritatis Unitas\" on the 900th anniversary of the First Lateran Synod. The Confederation is a \"union of charity\" which binds nine congregations of canons regular together for mutual aid and support. The initial four congregations were:\n\n\nSubsequently, other congregations of canons regular joined the confederation:\n\n\nThe abbot primate, who is elected by all the congregations and serves for a six-year term, works to foster contact and mutual cooperation among the diverse communities of canons regular in the Catholic Church. On 11 October 2016, Mgr Jean-Michel Girard, Abbot of the Congregation of St. Nicholas and St. Bernard of Mont Joux (Great St. Bernard, Switzerland) was elected as the 10th abbot primate of the Confederation of the Canons Regular of St Augustine.\n\nThe order has houses in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, England, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Peru, Porto Rico, Spain, Taiwan, Switzerland, the United States and Uruguay.\n\nOther orders sprang up which followed the Rule of St. Augustine and the canonical life. As canons regular became separated into different congregations they took their names from the locality in which they lived, or from the distinctive habit they wore, or from the one who led the way in remodelling their lives. Hence we have the White Canons of Prémontré; the White Canons of Saint John Lateran; the Black Canons of St. Augustine; the Canons of St. Victor at Paris and also at Marseilles.\n\nThe Premonstratensian Order was founded at Prémontré, near Laon, in Picardy (northern France), by St. Norbert in the year 1120. The order received formal approval from Pope Honorius II in 1126, the same year in which Norbert was appointed Archbishop of Magdeburg.\nAccording to the spirit of its founder, this congregation unites the active with the contemplative life, the institute embracing in its scope the sanctification of its members and the administration of the sacraments. It grew large even during the lifetime of its founder, and now has charge of many parishes and schools, especially in the Habsburg provinces of Austria and Hungary. The Premonstratensians wear a white habit with white cincture. They are governed by an abbot general, vicars and visitors.\n\nThe origin of the Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross appears to be uncertain, although all admit its great antiquity. It has been divided into four chief branches: the Italian, the Bohemian, the Belgian and the Spanish. Of this last very little is known. The branch once flourishing in Italy, after several attempts at reformation, was finally suppressed by Alexander VII in 1656. In Bohemia there are still some houses of \"Crosier Canons\", as they are called, who, however, seem to be different from the well known Belgian Crosiers, who trace their origin to the time of Innocent III and recognize for their Father Blessed Theodore de Celles, who founded their first house at Huy, near Liège. These Belgian Croisier Canons have a great affinity with the Dominicans. They follow the Rule of St. Augustine, and their constitutions are mainly those compiled for the Dominican Order by St. Raymond of Penafort. Besides the usual duties of canons in the church, they are engaged in preaching, administering the sacraments, and teaching. Formerly they had houses in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, England, Ireland and Scotland. Until about 1900 they also served missions in North America, they had five monasteries in Belgium, of which St. Agatha is considered the mother-house. To these Croisier Canons belongs the privilege, granted to them by Pope Leo X and confirmed by Leo XIII, of blessing beads with an indulgence of 500 days. Their habit was formerly black, but is now a white soutane with a black scapular and a cross, white and red on the breast. In choir they wear in summer the rochet with a black almuce.\n\nThe Canons Regular of St. John Cantius were founded in 1998 by Fr. C. Frank Phillips, C.R., and are active in the United States and Canada, principally in the area of parish ministry.\n\nThe Congregatio Canonicorum Sancti Augustini is a new Protestant religious community of Canons founded in 2008 at the ecumenical Priory of St. Wigbert in Werningshausen near Erfurt in Germany.\n\n\nExtinct congregations also include those of St. Rufus, founded in 1039, and once flourishing in Dauphiné; of Aroasia (Diocese of Arras, in France), founded in 1097; Marbach (1100); of the Holy Redeemer of Bologna, also called the Renana (1136), now united to the Lateran Congregation; of the Holy Spirit in Sassia (1198); of St. George in Alga, at Venice (1404); of Our Saviour in Lorraine, reformed in 1628 by St. Peter Fourier.\n\nThere are canonesses regular, as well as canons regular; the Apostolic origin is common to both. Communities of canonesses regular developed from the groups of women who took the name and the Rule of life laid down for the various congregations of canons regular. As with regard to origin and antiquity the same is to be said of orders of women both in general and in particular as of orders of men. St. Basil in his rules addresses both men and women. Augustine of Hippo drew up the first general rule for communities of women in the year 423.\n\nThe occupations of the canonesses consisted in the recitation of the Divine Office, the care of the church vestments, and the education of the young, particularly the daughters of the nobility. The regular canonesses, for the most part, follow the Rule of St. Augustine.\n\nSome congregations still extant include:\n\nAmong the orders which sprang from the canonical life were the Order of Preachers or Dominicans, as well as the Order of the Most Holy Trinity, or Trinitarians. St. Anthony of Padua started his religious life as a canon regular in Portugal before moving to the Franciscans. St. Bruno was originally a canon living under the Rule of Aachen for over 20 years when, at the age of 51, he and several companions began a new community at the Grande Chartreuse, and founded the Carthusian Order.\n\nFamous canons regular include Pope Adrian IV, Thomas à Kempis, and Desiderius Erasmus.\n\n\nSpecific references:\n\nAttribution:\n\n\n"}

This plain is a area that runs from Tallahassee, Florida, U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico and includes numerous first magnitude springs, including Wakulla Springs, and the Leon Sinks Cave System, the longest underwater cave in the United States. The project grew out of a cave diving research and exploration group established in 1985 and incorporated in 1990 (by Bill Gavin and Bill Main, later joined by Parker Turner, Lamar English and Bill McFaden, at the time the chairman of the NACD Exploration and Survey Committee).\n\nWKPP is the only organization currently allowed to dive some of these caves – which are all on State, Federal, or private land – due to the extreme nature of the systems and the discipline required to safely explore them, although these caves were explored extensively prior to the establishment of the WKPP. This is a controversial issue, as many people think these caves should be open to the public or, at the least, to other qualified cave diving groups and individuals. Recently, during 2007, one state-owned entrance of the Leon Sinks cave system has been reopened to other qualified cave divers.\n\nWKPP divers hold every deep (below ) distance record in underwater cave diving. WKPP director Casey McKinlay and Jarrod Jablonski hold the world's record for the greatest distance below ) from air in a cave dive - each way at Wakulla Spring at an average depth of . This record dive required more than 29 hours submersion including 16 hours of decompression (also a record). The WKPP also hold the world's record for the longest traverse between two known entry points - one way between Turner Sink and Wakulla Spring at an average depth of . The WKPP is also responsible for exploring and mapping more cave passageway below 190ft than any other organization in the world - . In total, WKPP explorers have mapped and explored as of June, 2018. \n\nThe data gathered by WKPP divers has allowed planners a better definition of what to expect from the underground aquifer system and how best to handle issues relating to such things as surface water runoff and other nonpoint source pollution issues. WKPP mapping has resulted in the State of Florida and the U.S. Department of Agriculture establishing a \"greenway\" surrounding the Leon Sinks cave system and a \"protection zone\" for Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park, as well as numerous improvements in water management district operations, DOT road-building, and development planning. WKPP data has been the basis for multi-million dollar land purchase decisions to protect critical \"below the surface\" resources requiring protection.\n\nThe WKPP is notable for its part in the development of cave diving techniques and team diving protocols, the DIR method of scuba diving (which is the basis for the teaching methodology of Global Underwater Explorers) and the use of the Halcyon PVR-BASC and RB80 rebreathers. DIR, an acronym for \"Doing It Right\", is a holistic approach to scuba diving. According to the DIR approach fundamental skills, teamwork, environmental awareness, and the use of highly optimized and streamlined equipment configuration are the primary fundamentals of diving. DIR proponents argue that through these essential elements, safety is improved by standardizing equipment configuration and procedures for preventing and dealing with emergencies, and out-of-air emergencies in particular.\n\nOn May 20, 2007, divers set off from Turner Sink to try to find a connection but were unable to when the cave became impassable after . On July 28, 2007, divers explored of new passage before discovering an exploration line from Wakulla Springs. On December 15, 2007, WKPP divers Casey McKinlay and Jarrod Jablonski completed a traverse from Turner Sink to Wakulla Springs, covering a distance of nearly . This traverse took approximately 7 hours, followed by 14 hours of decompression.\n\nCurrent projects include exploring, surveying, and mapping of the Wakulla-Leon Sinks Cave system, as well as coordinating between private, state, and federal agencies to help protect the flooded caves of the Woodville Karst Plain. Current WKPP exploration efforts in the Chip's Hole and Falmouth Cave Systems are also generating significant discoveries.\n\nIn 2011, the Florida House of Representatives adopted \"A resolution recognizing the Woodville Karst Plain Project for its outstanding contributions to the State of Florida through scientific research and its dedication and tireless efforts to promote the protection of the state's precious natural water resources\" (HR9053).\n\n"}

Political parties had been banned from competing in elections for nearly 20 years in order to curb sectarian tensions. President Yoweri Museveni instituted the non-party \"Movement\" system of government when he came to power in 1986. A referendum was held in 2000, but the proposal was rejected by over 90% of voters. This time it was approved by over 90% of voters.\n\nThe Ugandan Parliament voted to conduct the referendum on 4 May 2005. Enthusiasm for the poll was muted, however, as both the government and opposition supported a return to a multiparty system. Some political groupings, including the Forum for Democratic Change, boycotted the poll, claiming that it would legitimise 19 years of rule by an effective one-party state. President Museveni castigated the boycotters for \"not contributing to the development of Uganda\". Other observers suggested the $12.5m spent on the referendum might have been put to better use elsewhere in Uganda, one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\nThe lengthy question presented to voters on their ballots was criticised for being confusing: \"Do you agree to open up the political space to allow those who wish to join different organisations/parties to do so to compete for political power?\" Symbols of a tree and a house accompanied the 'yes' and 'no' boxes, respectively, on the ballot.\n\nMore than 90% of voters backed the return to multi-party politics. Some observers expressed surprise at the official figures given for voter turnout. Initial estimates indicated that less than 30% of Uganda's 8.5 million voters had turned out for the poll. The Electoral Commission, however, released an official figure of 47%. A low turnout would have been embarrassing for Museveni.\n\n\n"}

The specialisation has around 1200 personnel of all ranks posted to operational air stations, HQs and other establishments of the British Armed Forces, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.\n\nPersonnel have been employed in intelligence duties since the formation of the RAF in 1918. But the first dedicated RAF Intelligence Branch was established in late 1939 following the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September. This model was also adopted by other Commonwealth nations. The new Intelligence Branch was initially called the General Duties (Admin) Branch but later renamed the Administrative and Special Duties Branch (for Intelligence duties). At the time, officers of the Intelligence Branch performed the duty of Squadron Intelligence/Protection Officer or aircrew on ground tours in the Air Ministry Intelligence Department. These officers were mainly trained pilots on a ground tour or who for medical reasons could no longer fly. In 1939 the Secret Intelligence Service also established a dedicated Air Intelligence Section under the command of Group Captain F. W. Winterbotham (Chief of Air Intelligence, MI-6). During the Second World War, the Intelligence Branch became larger to encompass the Signals Intelligence staff at Bletchley Park and the Imagery Intelligence staff at RAF Medmenham.\n\nAt the outbreak of war, the Air Ministry recognised the need for formalised Intelligence training and established a number of courses to teach Volunteer Reserve Officers the art of Intelligence analysis. Much of this early training was very simplistic and did little more than introduce those to be employed in intelligence duties to the structure of the secretive organisation and where sources came from. The first series of courses started on 20 November 1939 at Hibbert Road in Harrow. These were short courses of seven days duration giving a broad picture of intelligence in Commands, Groups and Stations. After five of these courses had been run, the training was moved to 14 Ryder Street, St James, London. In September 1940 they moved back to Harrow to Fisher Road School, Wealdsden. Incorporated into the syllabus was the Advanced Intelligence Course, designed for Senior RAF Intelligence Officers from operational commands, and certain Naval and Army Intelligence Officers. The first of these courses started on 28 October 1940 and was three weeks in duration. This series continued without interruption and in 1942 developed into the RAF Intelligence School.\n\nIn September 1942, the training school moved to Caen Wood Towers (Caenwood Towers), Highgate (this building was later renamed Athlone House). By this time it was clear to the Air Staff that intelligence was a positive and vital element affecting Air Ministry policy, strategy and planning, so the RAF Intelligence School was officially constituted and given a proper home at Caen Wood Towers. The site was set up as Royal Air Force Station Highgate around grounds and outbuildings of the Caen Wood estate. This included accommodation, messing, equipment stores and a medical centre. Because of the sensitivity of intelligence and covert operations during the war, the site was not made fully public and it operated under the guise of an RAF convalescence hospital. A number of different courses were run lasting between five days and three weeks, teaching Air Intelligence, Escape and Evasion, and Basic Intelligence Analysis for direct entrants to intelligence work. The majority of the instruction was given by visiting specialists (from Air Ministry, MI-6, MI-9, Central Interpretation Unit Medmenham and Station \"X\" at Bletchley Park.)\n\nThe unit was soon awarded a badge (crest) as a proof of the high official regard for the value of the school. The badge consisted of a Sphinx, denoting wisdom, backed by a sun in splendour, depicting elucidation, with the motto \"Praemonitus Praemunitus\" which translates as \"Forewarned is Forearmed\".\n\nIn 1943, the Unit was transferred for administrative purposes to No. 28 Group RAF under RAF Technical Training Command. Additional courses were added for Security, Air Intelligence for RAF Bomber Command, a Far East Course and Air Intelligence for Senior Officers. During the period from November 1939 to September 1945, 7,086 Officers of the British Services (including dominion and Allied Forces attached to the RAF) attended over 372 courses. In late 1944, the school was hit twice by German V-1 flying bombs causing damage to the buildings and injuring a number of staff.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, training continued at RAF Highgate until 1948 when the Air Ministry decided that the School should move to the Air Ministry building as they were de-requisitioning the property. The Branch was split up into Administrative and Special Duties Branch (Photography) and Administrative and Special Duties Branch (Signals), with no dedicated Air Intelligence specialisation.\n\nIn 1965, the three service intelligence departments were amalgamated in the new Defence Intelligence Staff at the Ministry of Defence. Training at the RAF Intelligence School continued until 1969, teaching non-specialist Officers (GD and Administrators) the basics of Intelligence. The role of Squadron or Station Intelligence Officer was filled by members of the Administrative Branch as a sub-specialisation. \n\nOn 2 August 1969, the RAF Intelligence School was officially closed and intelligence training was transferred to the School of Service Intelligence (SSI) at Ashford, Kent. In the 1950s the Photographic Interpretation (PI) Branch was formed for commissioned officers to be employed at the reconnaissance intelligence centres attached to aircraft units, and also to work at the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC) at RAF Brampton. \n\nBy the start of the 1990s, the RAF could see the benefit of an independent Intelligence Branch, creating the GD (Intelligence) Branch. They required more information and warning on the potential enemies around the world in order to maintain the diminishing RAF's ability to react. In 1997, GD (INT) became the Operations Support (Intelligence) specialisation that is in existence today.\n\nHowever, training for officers focused on imagery analysis with general intelligence being taught at Ashford on a three week course at the Defence Intelligence and Security School (DISS), the renamed SSI. The first professional Air Intelligence course (RAF Intelligence Course - RAFIC) was run in the Air Intelligence Wing of DISS in 2000, following the school's move to Chicksands in Bedfordshire. After the first two courses, the Royal Navy was invited to send officers to attend and the course was renamed the Joint Air Intelligence Course (JAIC). In 2005, DISS became part of the Defence College of Intelligence and the Air Intelligence Wing was renamed Horus Training Delivery Wing. Following a re-organisation in 2007, the structure was changed again and the Defence School of Intelligence (DSI) was set up with Air Intelligence Wing as a sub-organisation as the Phase 2 training unit (professional specialist training) for all RAF Intelligence Analyst Airmen, RAF Intelligence Officers, plus as a Phase 3 training unit (Continuation Specialist Training) for RAF Intelligence Analyst NCOs and Royal Navy and British Army Officers employed in air intelligence duties.\n\nEntrants to the specialisation undertake common training at RAF College Cranwell for officers and RAF Halton for airmen. Following initial training, entrants are posted to the Joint Intelligence Training Group (JITG) Chicksands, in Shefford, Bedfordshire for specialist training.\n\nThe Air Intelligence Wing of the Defence School of Intelligence (DSI) delivers the Joint Air Intelligence Course (JAIC) to officers and the Operational Air Intelligence Course (OpAIC) to airmen. These courses prepare the individual for posting to intelligence roles. After completion of the first tour of duty, airmen can choose to further specialise in Imagery or Signals Analysis. These Phase 2 specialist courses are delivered in the joint environment alongside intelligence specialists of the Royal Navy, British Army or Ministry of Defence civil servants.\n\nFurther training courses are provided throughout a career, in; Intelligence Mission Support, Collections Management, Cyber Warfare, Human Intelligence, PsyOps, ISR Management; including the QWI ISR Course and Targeting.\n\nEntrants to the branch are initially trained as general intelligence analysts and can later sub-specialise in one of a number of trades. Personnel in each sub-specialisation can be employed in a number of locations.\n\n\n\nAs with all RAF trades and sub-specialisations personnel can be employed in a range of locations within the trade or in the wider organisation. These can include:\n\nHeads of RAF Intelligence have been:\n\n\nNotable Former Military Members\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The road still exists as it passes across the Chevin hill and descends into the village by what is now Sunny Hill. It is thought to have then proceeded along the east bank of the river to the Roman garrison of Derventio, in what is now Derby where it connected with Rykneld Street.\n\nHowever, next to it was Makeney where, in 1554, Burchard Kranich built the first Smeltmill for extracting lead from its ore. Then, in 1581 Sir John Zouch of Codnor Castle set up a wire drawing works This followed the opening of a works in Hathersage in 1566 where Christopher Schutz, a German immigrant, had invented a process for drawing wire. Hathersage became a centre for wire drawing and, later, needle making\n\nOf Makeney, it was written in 1817, \"Makeney, a hamlet of [the parish of Duffield], (Machenie), is described in the Domesday Survey as one of the manors of Henry de Ferrars. It is now considered as parcel of the manor of Duffield. <br>About 700 hands are employed by Messrs. Strutt in the spinning and bleaching of cotton, at Millford, a populous manufacturing village in this parish.<br>There is a Unitarian chapel at Millford, supported by Mr. Strutt; who supports also a Lancasterian school, in which the numbers are about 300: a room to accommodate about 400 is now building at Millford. The girls in this school, and that at Belper, are taught to sew, cut out, &c. as well as to read and write. A chapel has lately been erected here for the Wesleyan Methodists.\"\n\nThe Royal Mint had acquired the rights to Schutz' process in 1568 and set out to restrict its use to the Company of Mineral and Battery Works. However, the works continued supplying the Belper nail makers among others and by the time Jedediah Strutt bought it, it consisted of two forges and a slitting and rolling mill, occupying both sides the river. Some of the mill buildings are now the Riverside Garden Centre.\n\nIn 1778 Jedediah Strutt built cotton spinning mills after the pattern developed by Richard Arkwright having been in partnership with him when he built the mill at Cromford. Part of the Milford mill still exists as well as much of the workers' housing.\nMilford's claim to fame is that one of Strutt's apprentices at Milford was Samuel Slater, who absconded to America carrying Arkwright's system in his head. He settled in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and replicated Arkwright's success.\n\nThere is some debate about the origin of the name Milford. It is generally reckoned to be a corruption of \"mule forde\" and it is so recorded (briefly) in the Domesday Book when it was owned by Henry de Ferrers. There were a number of fords, which probably changed their position as the river changed its course. An old lane leading down to one of them was called \"Save Penny Lane,\" because people who used it, and crossed the ford, saved the penny toll which Messrs. Strutt charged for crossing the bridge they had built. Afterwards, the Strutts had the ford destroyed and the river deepened. At some time, however, Milford was called New Mills. A map of 1787 names the road from Duffield as New Mills Road, and Samuel Slater's indentures as an apprentice record him as living in \"New Mills, in the Parish of Duffield\".\n\nThe Holly Bush Inn is a 17th or early 18th century Grade II listed public house at 2 Holly Bush Lane, Makeney (part of Milford).

It is also referred to as MVEG cycle (Motor Vehicle Emissions Group).\n\nThe NEDC, which is supposed to represent the typical usage of a car in Europe, is repeatedly criticised for delivering economy-figures which are unachievable in reality. It consists of four repeated ECE-15 urban driving cycles (UDC) and one Extra-Urban driving cycle (EUDC).\n\nThe test procedure is defined in UNECE R101 for the measurement of and fuel consumption and/or the measurement of electric\nenergy consumption and electric range in hybrid and fully electric M1 and N1 vehicles, and UNECE R83 for the measurement of emission of pollutants of M, N1 and M2 vehicles. It is maintained by the UNECE World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29), which also works on its successor, the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures (WLTP).\n\nAlthough originally designed for petrol-based road vehicles, the driving cycle is now also used for diesel vehicles and to estimate the electric power consumption and driving range of hybrid and battery electric vehicles.\n\nSeveral measurements are usually performed along the cycle. The figures made available to the general public are:\n\nThe following parameters are also generally measured to validate the compliance to European emission standards:\n\nSome or all of the following parameters are measured depending upon the requirements of the region implementing the test:\nThe region implementing the test defines limits for each of the pollutants, for instance the Euro level within the EU.\n\nThe cycle must be performed on a cold vehicle at 20–30 °C (typically run at 25 °C). The cycles may be performed on a flat road, in the absence of wind. However, to improve repeatability, they are generally performed on a roller test bench. This type of bench is equipped with an electrical machine to emulate resistance due to aerodynamic drag and vehicle mass (inertia).\n\nFor each vehicle configuration, a look-up table is applied: each speed corresponds to a certain value of resistance (reverse torque applied to the drive wheels). This arrangement enables the use of a single physical vehicle to test all vehicle body styles (Sedan, hatchback, MPV etc.) by simply changing the look-up table. A fan is coupled to the roller bench to provide the vehicle air intakes with an airflow matching the current speed. Many more tests can be performed during vehicle development with this arrangement than with conventional road tests.\n\nThe test is conducted with all ancillary loads turned off (Air conditioning compressor and fan, lights, heated rear window, etc.)\n\nThe Urban Driving Cycle ECE-15 (or just UDC) was introduced first in 1970 as part of ECE vehicle regulations; the recent version is defined by ECE R83, R84 and R101. The cycle has been designed to represent typical driving conditions of busy European cities, and is characterized by low engine load, low exhaust gas temperature, and a maximum speed of 50 km/h.\n\nWhen the engine starts, the car pauses for 11 s - if equipped with a manual gearbox, 6 s in neutral (with clutch engaged) and 5 s in the 1st gear (with clutch disengaged) - then slowly accelerates to 15 km/h in 4 s, cruises at constant speed for 8 s, brakes to a full stop in 5 s (manual: last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then stops for 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, then 5 s in the 1st gear).\n\nAt 49 s, the car slowly accelerates to 32 km/h in 12 s (manual: 5 s in 1st gear, 2 s gear change, then 5 s in the 2nd gear), cruises for 24 s, slowly brakes to a full stop in 11 s (manual: last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then pauses for another 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, 5 s in the 1st gear).\n\nAt 117 s, the car slowly accelerates to 50 km/h in 26 s (manual: 5 s, 9 s and 8 s in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears, with additional 2 × 2 s for gear changes), cruises for 12 s, decelerates to 35 km/h in 8 s, cruises for another 13 s, brakes to a full stop in 12 s (manual: 2 s change to the 2nd gear, 7 s in the 2nd gear, last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then pauses for 7 s (manual: in neutral with clutch engaged).\n\nThe cycle ends on 195 s after a theoretical distance of 994.03 meters, then it repeats four consecutive times. Total duration is 780 s (13 minutes) over a theoretical distance of 3976.1 meters, with an average speed of 18.35 km/h.\n\nThe Extra-Urban Driving Cycle EUDC, introduced by ECE R101 in 1990, has been designed to represent more aggressive, high speed driving modes. The maximum speed of the EUDC cycle is 120 km/h; low-powered vehicles are limited to 90 km/h.\n\nAfter a 20 s stop - if equipped with manual gearbox, in the 1st gear with clutch disengaged - the car slowly accelerates to 70 km/h in 41 s (manual: 5 s, 9 s, 8 s and 13 s in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears, with additional 3 × 2 s for gear changes), cruises for 50 s (manual: in the 5th gear [sic]), decelerates to 50 km/h in 8 s (manual: 4 s in the 5th and 4 s in the 4th gear [sic]) and cruises for 69 s, then slowly accelerates to 70 km/h in 13 s .\n\nAt 201 s, the car cruises at 70 km/h for 50 s (manual: in the 5th gear), then slowly accelerates to 100 km/h in 35 s and cruises for 30 s (manual: in the 5th or 6th gear).\n\nFinally, at 316 s the car slowly accelerates to 120 km/h in 20 s, cruises for 10 s, then slowly brakes to a full stop in 34 s (manual: in the 5th or 6th gear, last 10 s with clutch disengaged), and idles for another 20 s (manual: in neutral).\n\nTotal duration is 400 s (6 minutes 40 s seconds) and theoretical distance is 6956 meters, with an average speed of 62.6 km/h.\n\nThe combined fuel economy is calculated by a total consumption of urban and extra-urban cycles over the total distance (theoretical 10932 meters). The total test time amounts to 1180 s with an average speed of 33.35 km/h. Sometimes the NEDC is also quoted at 1220 s, which includes the initial 40 s with the vehicle at standstill and combustion engine off.\n\nThe NEDC was conceived when European vehicles were lighter and less powerful. The test offers a stylized driving speed pattern with low accelerations, constant speed cruises, and many idling events. However, accelerations are much steeper and variable in practice, which is in part caused by the power surplus of modern engines as the average-time decreased from 14 seconds in 1981 to 9 seconds in 2007. In 1998, a Swedish researcher criticized the NEDC standard for allowing large emission differences between test and reality.\n\nThe UK consumer group Which?, criticized the NEDC test procedure as being out-of-date as its most recent update was made in 1997; before hybrid cars and stop-start technology was generally available. Which? claimed the test did not replicate real-world driving conditions and had numerous loopholes which cause the results to be unachievable in practice. It was also claimed that no official body polices the tests and the vehicle manufacturers can arbitrarily reduce their results by 4% at the end of the cycle. Weaknesses noted are: (i) that tests are not necessarily repeatable and comparable; (ii) the test-cycle does not include sustained motorway driving; (iii) test-cycles can be performed using optional economy settings which will not typically be selected by drivers; (iv) the test-cycle is performed with ancillary equipment such an air-conditioning and heated windows switched off; (v) the tests can be conducted at 2 km/h (1.2 mph) below the required speed thus using less fuel; (vi) roof-rails and passenger door-mirror can be removed for the test, to reduce drag; (vii) tyre inflation for the test can be set above the recommended pressure values to artificially reduce rolling resistance.\n\nFor the emission standards to deliver real emission reductions it is crucial to use a test cycle that reflects real-world driving style. However the fixed speeds, gear shift points and accelerations of the NEDC offer possibilities for manufacturers to engage in what is called 'cycle beating' to optimise engine emission performance to the corresponding operating points of the test cycle, while emissions from typical driving conditions would be much higher than expected, undermining the standards and public health. In one particular instance, research from two German technology institutes found that for diesel cars no 'real' reductions have been achieved after 13 years of stricter standards.\n\nIt is alleged that, under NEDC, some automakers overinflate tires, adjusting or disconnecting brakes to reduce friction, and taping cracks between body panels and windows to reduce air resistance, some go as far as removing wing mirrors, to inflate measured fuel economy and lower measured carbon emission.\n\nIn addition, the height of the simulated wind fan could alter the performance of after-treatment systems due to changes in temperature and, consequently, modify the pollutant emissions values.\n\nUNECE WP29 is currently developing a new global harmonized driving cycle, the World Light Test Procedure (WLTP) with participation of experts from the European Union, India, and Japan; it will apply to light duty vehicles (i.e. passenger cars and light commercial vans).\n\nThe European Commission intends to introduce a type approval procedure to measure the energy efficiency of mobile air conditioning systems in vehicles, as well as its effect on fuel consumption and emissions, and display an efficiency label on the vehicle; the work is being performed by TU Graz (Institute for Internal combustion engines and Thermodynamics), Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics), TNO and ACEA.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2326471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326471", "title": "Edenderry", "text": "Edenderry\n\nEdenderry (; ) is a town in east County Offaly, Ireland. It is near the borders with Counties Kildare, Meath and Westmeath. The Grand Canal runs along the south of Edenderry, through the Bog of Allen, and there is a short spur to the town centre.\n\nThe R401 road from Kinnegad to the north and the R402 from Enfield to the east meet at the northeastern end of the Main Street. At the Grand Canal they split, with the R402 continuing westwards towards Tullamore and the R401 heads south to Rathangan and Kildare Town.\n\nIn the 16th century, Edenderry was known as Coolestown, after the family of Cooley or Cowley, who had a castle here. It was defended in 1599 against the Earl of Tyrone's rebellion. This subsequently passed by marriage to the Blundell family and was sacked in 1691 by the army of James II.\n\nThe Blundells' land passed subsequently to the Marquess of Downshire who reversed the earlier opposition of the Blundell sisters to the establishment of a branch to the Grand Canal to Edenderry and paid for the £692 cost of the project, which was completed in 1802.\n\nBy 1716 there was thriving woollen cloth manufacturing, established by Quakers, which employed around 1,000 people. By 1911 the town had grown to 2,204 people. Other industries included the factory of Daniel Alesbury who made a variety of woodwork as well as the first car manufactured in Ireland, the Alesbury, in 1907.\n\nThe town experienced some growth in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly with the building of peat burning power stations at Rhode, Allenwood and Portarlington by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) and the Bord na Móna (BNM) peat briquette factories at Lullymore and Mountlucas. In addition, there was also seasonal harvesting of peat at Derrygreenagh and Lullymore, producing and harvesting machine turf at Rathangan. Most of these factories and works are now closed. BNM has diversified with the harvesting of peat and a provider of resource recovery, feedstock, retail services, environmental services and power generation.\n\nThe population of Edenderry almost doubled in the 20 years between the census of 1996 (when it had a population of 3,825 people) and the 2016 census (which recorded a population of 7,359 people).\n\nA single railway track connected Edenderry to nearby Enfield or Innfield until 1963. The line provided both passenger and goods service until 1931, and goods only until it closed. In the years up to 1963 the line saw very infrequent service, and mostly carried livestock, sugar beet, and turf, as well as private excursions. Little remains of the line, except for occasional landmarks, such as the station house near the town centre on the Dublin road which is now a commercial business known as Station House Enterprises.\n\nMost of the station yard and structures were intact until the late 1980s, with dual engine sheds, warehouse, loading gantries, a water tank, complete with a gantry hose, platforms and station master office. There was also a turntable basin located just behind the engine sheds, formed into the side of the hill with a 30' circular retaining wall on two sides, allowing engines to run in be turned and run out. Locally the town municipal water supply was highly chlorinated and at times impossible to drink. After the station was closed and the turntable was removed a spring in the turntable basin provided fresh water, and was known locally as \"Coughlin's well! \". It continued to be used into the 1980s with Offaly County Council maintaining this site for a while. The spring was reached by a set of steps just beside the station master's house off Father Kearns street. \n\nThe line was begun in 1873 1.5 miles west of Innfield as a branch line, the Up only junction being called \"Nesbitt Junction\". Finance was provided by a Mrs. Nesbit. It was built by railway contractor Bagnell and opened four years later in 1877. Running and maintenance was by the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR). With no through running for scheduled passenger traffic, it was considered a branch or slip line. For the journey to Dublin passengers from Edenderry would have to wait in the detached coach for a scheduled upbound train coming through the station, continuing on to Dublin or change platforms for westbound trains.\n\nOrganisations and businesses operating in the area include the Offaly Express newspaper and Edenderry Chamber of Commerce. \n\nLocal sports clubs include Edenderry Rugby Club, \nEdenderry GAA club, Edenderry Town AFC, and Highfield Golf Club.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2326475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326475", "title": "Learjet 25", "text": "Learjet 25\n\nThe Learjet 25 is an American ten-seat (two crew and eight passengers), twin-engine, high-speed business jet aircraft manufactured by Learjet. It is a stretched version of the Learjet 24.\n\nThe first Model 25 flew on August 12, 1966, and the first delivery was in November 1967.\n\nThe Learjet 25 is similar to the Model 24 but is 1.27 m (4 ft 2 in) longer, allowing for three additional passengers. In 1970 the Learjet 25B was produced along with the Learjet 25C in the same year. Type development continued with the Models 25D and 25G, which included more advanced CJ610-8A engines and a ceiling increase to 51,000 feet.\n\nBy 2018, 1970s Learjet 25s were sold for under $200,000.\n\nTwo General Electric CJ610-6 single-rotor axial-flow turbojet engines are pylon-mounted on each side of the aft fuselage. Each engine is rated at 2950 pounds of thrust at sea level. The engine compartments consist of an eight-stage axial-flow compressor directly coupled to a two-stage turbine, a through-flow annular combustion system, variable inlet guide vanes, controlled compressor interstage bleed, exhaust nozzle and accessory drive system. Starting ignition is provided by a dual output capacitor-discharge system. As the ignition cycle is completed, the igniter plugs cease sparking and combustion becomes self-sustaining. A fuel control metering system selects the rate of fuel flow to the engine combustor.\n\nThe electrically operated RPM tachometer consists of a signal generator on the engine and an indicator located in the centre of the instrument panel. Dial markings are based on percent of maximum allowable engine speed. The large markings are graduated in 2% increments from 0% to 100% and the small dial is graduated in 1% increments from 0% to 10% to allow the pilots to accomplish more precise engine speed settings.\nThe engine pressure ratio (EPR) system enables the pilot to obtain power required to meet certified aircraft performance without exceeding engine limitations. The engine compressor inlet and turbine discharge pressures are sensed by the EPR transmitter and transformed into an electrical signal that is transmitted to the EPR indicator.\n\nFuel flow is indicated via a fuel flow system. The fuel flow through a rotor-turbine at each engine causes the rotor to spin and a pickup coil emits pulses as the rotor blades pass through the coil field. The pulsating dc voltage is averaged and forwarded through the selector switch to the fuel flow indicator.\n\nThe landing gear, brake, flap and spoiler systems are hydraulically operated. On aircraft 25-061 through 25-180 the engine driven hydraulic pumps supply fluid under pressure of 1500 psi to the system pressure is maintained at 1250 to 1500 psi by a pressure regulator. On aircraft 25-181 and subsequent the variable volume engine driven pump delivers fluid under a pressure of 1450 psi to the system and static pressure is maintained at 1500 to 1550 psi. Over pressurization is prevented by a pressure relief valve which opens at 1700 psi. A pre-charged accumulator dampens and absorbs pressure surges. Two motor-driven shutoff valves will stop hydraulic flow to the engine-driven pumps in case of an emergency. The valves are controlled by the FIRE switch and activation of these valves are indicated with pinhead lights located in the cockpit next to the FIRE switch.\n\nOn aircraft equipped with an auxiliary hydraulic pump, the hydraulic pump switch located at the lower centre of the instrument panel activates the auxiliary hydraulic pump to provide in-flight standby hydraulic pressure. A pressure switch will energize the pump if hydraulic pressure falls below a preset level and de-energize the pump when pressure returns to normal. A duty cycle of 3 minutes on and a cooling period of 20 minutes off is required to avoid overheating the pump motor.\n\nThe hydraulically retractable landing gear is of conventional tricycle configuration with air-hydraulic shock-type nose and main gear. The main gear has dual wheels and brakes on each strut. The brake system incorporates four power-boosted disc-type brakes with integral anti-skid system. The nose wheel has a specially moulded tire to prevent water splashing into the engines.\n\nNose wheel steering is electronically controlled by the rudder pedals, utilizing the synchro principle. Hydraulic pressure for retraction and extension of the gear is transmitted by a system of tubing, hoses and actuating cylinders and is electrically controlled by limit switches and solenoid valves. Emergency extension can be accomplished pneumatically in case of hydraulic or electrical system failure. The main gear is enclosed by two doors after retraction. The inboard doors are hydraulically operated while the outboard doors are mechanically operated by linkage connected to the main gear struts. The nose gear doors operate mechanically with linkages attached to the nose gear shock strut.\n\nThe Learjet 25 utilize wheel brakes as the primary method for reducing speed after landing. The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power boost. The brake valves are controlled via the rudder pedal toe brakes through mechanical linkages. Two shuttle valves in the pressure lines prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the brake system for emergency braking. An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.\n\nWheel speed transducers in each main wheel axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts braking pressure to the return line by means of a spool valve. As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal braking pressure is restored.\n\nThe Learjet 25 generally has five fuel tanks. Two wing tanks, a fuselage tank and two wing tip tanks. Each wing tank extends from the centre bulkhead outboard to the wing tip and provides separate fuel for each engine. A tank cross-flow valve is installed to prevent fuel transfer between wing tanks. Flapper-type check valves, located in the various wing ribs, allow free fuel flow inboard but restrict outboard flow. A jet pump and electrical boost pump are mounted in each wing tank near the centre bulkhead to supply fuel under pressure to the respective engine fuel system.\n\nThe tip tanks provide additional fuel capacity to enable longer times aloft. A jet pump installed in each tip tank transfers fuel into the wing tanks. Fuel can also flow via the flapper check valves into the wing tanks, but the lower half of the fuel in the tip tanks must be transferred with the jet pump.\n\nMost Learjet 25 aircraft were fitted with a fuselage tank. The fuselage tank can be filled by the wing boost pumps through the transfer line and the fuel transfer valve. When the tank is full, a float switch de-energizes the wing boost pumps and closes the valve. During fuel transfer, the fuselage tank transfer pump pumps fuel into the both wing tanks.\n\nThe aircraft is equipped with AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) electrical systems. The DC system is powered from two 28 Volt, 400 Amperes, engine-driven starter-generators. Two 24 Volt batteries provide standby power for the DC system and are used for engine starting. AC current is provided by two 1000 Volt-Amperes (VA) solid-state inverters. The inverter outputs are frequency synchronized through a paralleling bus tie. Some aircraft have a 1000 VA auxiliary inverter that is used as an option for added system capacity.\n\nPrimary flight control is achieved by use of dual control wheels and rudder pedals. The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks. Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches are located in the control wheels. The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.\n\nConventional wing flaps are used to improve low speed flying characteristics and reduce landing and take-off speeds. The flaps are hydraulically operated. Interconnecting cables synchronize the flaps throughout their range of travel and a limit switch located on the left flap sector prevents over-travel. An audible waning horn warns of flap extension to more than 25 degrees if the landing gear is not down and locked.\n\nThe stall warning system utilizes a stall warning vane on each side of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the stall warning system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.\n\nAirspeed indication is provided by a single pointer, dual scale airspeed/ mach meter. The pointer responds to the dynamic pressure from the pitot heads on the nose compartment. The conventional airspeed scale is calibrated in knots and the Mach scale is calibrated in percentage of Mach and connected to an aneroid that moves the scale to compensate for changes in pressure altitude.\n\nEngine bleed air is admitted through a flow control valve to a heat exchanger. The cabin temperature is controlled by regulating the temperature of the pressure bleed air that is routed through the cabin. The bleed air is cooled in the heat exchanger by ram air entering the dorsal fin inlet and passing through the heat exchanger. The amount of bleed air cooling at the heat exchanger can be controlled by the hot air bypass valve (H-valve). The H-valve position can be adjusted by the crew to increase or reduce the amount of bleed air cooling at the heat exchanger.\n\nA refrigeration-type cooling system is used for cooling and dehumidification while the aircraft is on the ground or operating at altitudes below 18 000 feet. The refrigeration system consists of a compressor, receiver dehydrator and evaporative cooler located above the baggage compartment.\n\nThe Learjet 25 cabin is pressurized to enable high altitude operations without the use of supplemental oxygen. The cabin pressure is provided by the conditioned air entering the cabin through the distribution ducts and controlled by modulating the amount of air exhausted from the cabin. During ground operations, a solenoid limits the pressure differential to 0.25 psi in order to ensure normal functioning of the door and emergency exit. The pressure differential at final cruising altitude will be maintained at 8.7 psi difference between pressure altitude and cabin altitude. A rate controller enables the crew to select the rate pressurization of the cabin within preset limits. The normal pressure relief valve will open at 8.9 psi differential pressure and the safety outflow valve will open at 9.2 psi differential pressure which is the maximum allowable differential pressure.\nOxygen is contained in a pressurized bottle located in the dorsal fin of the aircraft. The use of oxygen is only required for emergency in case of depressurization of the cabin or contamination of the cabin air. Oxygen is always available for the crew and can be made available to the passengers manually or automatically. The oxygen storage cylinder has a capacity of 38 cubic feet and is stored at 1800 psi. An oxygen rupture disc will relieve oxygen pressure if the oxygen cylinder pressure reaches 2700 to 3000 psi. A green overboard indicator on the outside surface of the dorsal fin will be ruptured or missing to indicate that the rupture disc is not intact.\n\nThe engine fire system is of the continuous-element type and will provide a FIRE warning indication to the crew in the event that the rear nacelle area temperature exceeds 510 degrees Fahrenheit or if the forward nacelle area temperature exceeds 480 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nTwo spherical fire extinguisher containers can discharge their contents to either engine. A check valve prevents reverse flow between the containers. Monobromotrifluoromethane (CF3BR) is used as extinguishing agent. Two disc-type indicators are flush mounted under the left engine. If the yellow disc is ruptured, either or both containers have been discharged into the engine nacelle. If the red disc is ruptured, either or both the containers have been discharged overboard as a result of an overheat condition causing excessive pressure within the containers.\n\nA drag chute is fitted as optional equipment on some Learjet 25 aircraft. The chute offers an addition safety margin, since it can significantly reduce the stopping distance. The drag chute is attached to the aircraft with a lanyard system that releases it from the aircraft should an inadvertent deployment be made while airborne. The lanyard is attached to the aircraft at the forward end of the tailcone access door opening. This point is near the aircraft centre of gravity and minimizes weathervaning when the chute is deployed under crosswind conditions. The drag chute has been deployed in a crosswind of up to 20 knots under actual test conditions.\n\nTaxi operations are accomplished using the electronic nose wheel steering. The steering system on aircraft without variable authority nose wheel steering requires the pilot to select master or primary steering mode. In master mode, 10 degrees of steering is possible. This mode is suitable for straight taxi, takeoff and gentle turns. Primary steering mode allows up to 45 degrees angle of turn and is suitable for slow speed aggressive steering maneuvers. On aircraft equipped with variable authority steering, the steering authority varies with ground speed.\nThe CJ610-6 engines fitted to the Learjet 25 have very low inertia and accelerate rapidly. The time required to accelerate from idle to 100% RPM is approximately four seconds. This excellent throttle response enables rapid acceleration and precise power settings. Single engine performance is good with the single engine rate of climb approximately 1700 feet per minute at gross weight at sea level and a single engine service ceiling of approximately 21500 feet.\n\nThe spoilers provide an effective means of increasing normal rates of descent and may be used as a drag device to achieve rapid airspeed deceleration.\n\nThe best glide distance with engines windmilling is obtained with a clean airplane configuration and with a glide speed of 160 to 170 knots. At this speed, the Learjet 25 glides approximately 26 nautical miles for each 10000 feet of altitude loss. This is a glide ratio of 16 to 1 and is based on a wings level glide with gear and flap up and a gross weight of 11000 to 12000 pounds.\n\nThe Learjet 25 is a challenging aircraft to fly in comparison with most general aviation aircraft and more modern light jets. Pilot workload is high and approach, landing and takeoff speeds are above average for civilian aircraft. The Learjet 25 also requires long runways at high altitude or ambient temperature. At 6000 feet elevation, 50 degrees Fahrenheit and with an average load of 5 passengers, the Learjet 25B will require approximately 8000 feet of runway.\n\nThe Learjet 25 offers an ideal high speed platform for business travel for six to eight passengers. The aircraft's high rate of climb enables it to pass congested flight levels quickly. Typical cruising altitudes are between Flight Level 390 and Flight Level 430 which means the Learjet 25 is capable of overflying most weather systems and congested airspace. With a cruising speed of approximately Mach 0.76, passengers reach their destination in good time.\n\nThe cabin interior can be converted to several different configurations to allow for cargo and medevacs. Due to the ease of converting the cabin the Learjet 25 has found a niche as a medevac aircraft. This is achieved by removing the starboard seating to allow for a stretcher, mounting oxygen bottles and intravenous drip equipment. The two flight crew are then supplemented by either a doctor or flight nurse or both. The Model 25C also has an optional two bed sleeping compartment.\n\nDespite being used at lower altitudes and equipped with small landing gear, the Learjet can land on gravel runways if it is fitted with a special \"gravel kit\". It is possible for gravel from an improperly packed gravel runway to be sucked into the engines causing \"foreign object damage\", thus the need for the kit.\n\nIn 1974 the Peruvian Air Force purchased two 25Bs with a belly pod that contained an aerial survey camera.\n\nMany Learjet 25 aircraft remain in regular use today, particularly in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nIn 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015. The Learjet 25 is listed explicitly in Federal Register 78 FR 39576. Any Learjet 25s that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had \"hushkits\" installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015. \"14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less\" – lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015.\n\nThe ICAO designator as used in flight plans for all Learjet 25 models is LJ25.\n\nFAA certified on October 10, 1967.\n\nImproved version. FAA certified on September 4, 1970.\n\nImproved version with greater fuel capacity. FAA certified on September 4, 1970.\n\nLonger-range version.\n\nIntroduced September 23, 1980. During a series of demonstration flights lasting from June 9 to 18, 1982, the 25G broke a number of long-distance speed and fuel consumption records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1950, where he later served as a social sciences instructor, from 1956 to 1960.\n\nUpon graduation from the Military Academy in 1950, Wickham was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the 18th Infantry Regiment and then the 6th Infantry Regiment in Berlin. He served as a platoon leader and company executive officer in the 511th Airborne Infantry Regiment and served as an aide-de-camp to the commander in the 37th Infantry Division and 10th Infantry Division. He received master's degrees in economics and government from Harvard University and was a graduate of the National War College and Armed Forces Staff College.\n\nWickham then served as operations officer of the 1st Battle Group, 5th Cavalry, in Korea, and was executive officer to Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Harold Johnson. Later he commanded in combat the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, where he was seriously wounded by a satchel charge explosive. Wickham spent over a year in the hospital recovering. He later commanded the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division in Germany.\n\nWickham returned to Vietnam as the Deputy Chief of Staff, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, and was responsible for negotiating release of all prisoners of war. He then commanded the 101st Airborne Division, was director of the Joint Staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and afterward, as a four-star general, became Commander in Chief of the United Nations Command and Commander of the United States Forces Korea and Eighth Army in Korea.\n\nIn 1979, Wickham played a leading role in calming political tensions after the assassination of South Korean President Park Chung Hee, and wrote a book \"Korea on the Brink\" about the dangerous period. He also served as senior military assistant to Secretaries of Defense James R. Schlesinger and Donald Rumsfeld. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Wickham Chief of Staff of the United States Army.\n\nWickham retired from the United States Army in 1987 after 37 years of active service. He was twice awarded the Silver Star for battlefield valor, as well as the Bronze Star Medal for valor, the Purple Heart, ten Air Medals, four Legions of Merit, four Defense Distinguished Service Medals, two Army Distinguished Service Medals, a Navy Distinguished Service Medal and Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, Expert Infantryman Badge, Parachutist Badge, and 21 foreign decorations, including the Republic of Korea's highest military decoration. He was named by \"Army Times\" as one of the ten leaders who most changed the United States Army. The Association of Graduates United States Military Academy presented him with the Distinguished Graduate Award in 2005, and he received the Infantry Doughboy Award in 2006.\n\nWickham served as Town Council President in Sun City, Arizona and as an elder at Saint Andrews Presbyterian Church in Tucson, Arizona. He served as Chairman of the Board for Honeywell Federal Systems and Nortel Federal Systems, and as director of several other corporations. He was named vice chairman for the United States-China National Committee and has served as a member of the Secretary of Defense Policy Board. He is also active in the United Way, and a member of the Alfalfa Club, and Council on Foreign Relations. For the past 20 years he continues as the Military and Foreign Affairs speaker on The Buckmaster Show, KVOI radio in Tucson, Arizona. In his autobiography \"My American Journey\", General Colin Powell mentioned serving with Wickham and praised him as \"every inch a Soldier\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2326501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326501", "title": "Galeaspida", "text": "Galeaspida\n\nGaleaspida (from Latin, \"Helmet shields\") is an extinct taxon of jawless marine and freshwater fish. The name is derived from \"galea\", the Latin word for \"helmet\", and refers to their massive bone shield on the head. Galeaspida lived in shallow, fresh water and marine environments during the Silurian and Devonian times (430 to 370 million years ago) in what is now Southern China, Tibet and Vietnam. Superficially, their morphology appears more similar to that of Heterostraci than Osteostraci, there being currently no evidence that the galeaspids had paired fins. However, Galeaspida are in fact regarded as being more closely related to Osteostraci, based on the closer similarity of the morphology of the braincase.\n\nThe defining characteristic of all galeaspids was a large opening on the dorsal surface of the head shield, which was connected to the pharynx and gill chamber, and a scalloped pattern of the sensory-lines.\n\nThe opening appears to have served both the olfaction and the intake of the respiratory water similar to the nasopharyngeal duct of hagfishes. Galeaspids are also the vertebrates which have the largest number of gills, as some species of the order Polybranchiaspidida (literally \"many gills shields\") had up to 45 gill openings. The body is covered with minute scales arranged in oblique rows and there is no other fin besides the caudal fin. The mouth and gill openings are situated on the ventral side of the head, which is flat or flattened and suggests that they were bottom-dwellers.\n\nThere are around 76 + described species of galeaspids in at least 53 genera.\n\nIf the families Hanyangaspidae and Xiushuiaspidae can be ignored as basal galeaspids, the rest of Galeaspida can be sorted into two main groups: the first being the order Eugaleaspidiformes, which comprises the genera \"Sinogaleaspis\", \"Meishanaspis\", and \"Anjianspis\", and the family Eugaleaspididae, and the second being the Supraorder Polybranchiaspidida, which comprises the order Polybranchiaspidiformes, which is the sister taxon of the family Zhaotongaspididae and the order Huananaspidiformes, and the family Geraspididae, which is the sister taxon of Polybranchiaspidiformes + Zhaotongaspididae + Huananaspidiformes.\n\nSome experts demote Galeaspida to the rank of subclass, and unite it with Pituriaspida and Osteostraci to form the class Monorhina.\n\nThe oldest known galeaspids, such as those of the genera \"Hanyangaspis\" and \"Dayongaspis\", first appear near the start of the Telychian age, of the latter half of the Llandovery epoch of the Silurian, about 436 million years ago. During the transition from the Llandovery to the Wenlock, the Eugaleaspids underwent a diversification event. By the time the Wenlock epoch transitioned into the Ludlow Epoch, all of the eugaleaspids, save for the Eugaleaspidae, were extinct. The Eugaleaspidae lived from the Wenlock, and were fairly long-lived, especially the genus \"Eugaleaspis\". The last of the Eugaleaspididae disappeared by the end of the Pragian Epoch of the Lower Devonian.\n\nThe first genus of Geraspididae, the eponymous \"Geraspis\", appears during the middle of the Telychian. The other genera of Polybranchiaspidida appear in the fossil record a little after the beginning of the Lochkovian Epoch, at the start of the Devonian. The vast majority of the supraorder's genera either date from the Pragian epoch, or have their ranges end there. By the time the Emsian epoch starts, only a few genera, such as \"Duyunolepis\" and \"Wumengshanaspis\", survive, with most others already extinct. The last galeaspid is an as yet undescribed species and genus from the Fammenian epoch of the Late Devonian, found in association with the tetrapod \"Sinostega\" and the antiarch placoderm \"Remigolepis\", in strata from the Northern Chinese province of Ningxia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2326508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326508", "title": "Canoness", "text": "Canoness\n\nA canoness is a member of a religious community of women living a simple life. Many communities observe the monastic Rule of St. Augustine. The name corresponds to the male equivalent, a canon. The origin and Rule are common to both. As with the canons, there are two types: canonesses regular, who follow the Augustinian Rule, and secular canonesses, who follow no monastic Rule of Life.\n\nThe involvement of women in the work of the Church goes back to the earliest time, and their uniting together for community exercises was a natural development of religious worship. Many religious orders and congregations of men have related convents of nuns, following the same rules and constitutions, many communities of canonesses taking the name and rule of life laid down for the congregations of regular canons.\n\nSaint Basil the Great in his rules addresses both men and women. Augustine of Hippo drew up the first general rule for such communities of women. It was written in the year 423 and was addressed to Felicitas, Superioress of the Monastery of Hippo, and to Rusticus, the priest whom Augustine had appointed to have charge of the nuns. In Ireland, St. Patrick instituted canons regular, and St. Bridget was the first of numberless canonesses. The monasteries of the Gilbertine Order were nearly always double, for men and women.\n\nTowards the close of the 8th century, the title of canoness is found for the first time, and it was given to these communities of women who, while they professed a common life, yet did not carry out to its full extent the original Rule of St. Augustine. These canonesses were practically an imitation of the chapters of canons regular which had then recently been received through the introduction of the \"Regula vitæ communis\" of St. Chrodegang of Metz. The canonesses took but two vows, chastity and obedience. Their superiors were known as abbesses, often held princely rank and had feudal jurisdiction.\n\nThe occupations of the canonesses consisted in the recitation of the Divine Office, the care of the church vestments, and the education of the young, particularly the daughters of the nobility. The regular canonesses, for the most part, follow the Rule of St. Augustine, but local circumstances have been the means of introducing various changes in details.\n\nSome communities of canonesses occupied themselves in the education of children, for example the Canonesses of the Congregation of Notre Dame (), instituted in 1597 at Mattaincourt, in Lorraine, by St. Peter Fourier, C.R.S.A., and the Blessed Alix Le Clerc, C.N.D. This congregation, whose charism is the education of poor girls, spread rapidly in France and Italy. In France alone, until the persecution of 1907, they had some thirty communities and as many schools for externs and boarders. Driven from France, some took refuge in England, like those of the famous convent of Les Oiseaux, Paris, who moved to Westgate-on-Sea, and those of Versailles who settled in Hull.\n\nIn many religious orders and congregations, communities of men and communities of women are related, following the same rules and constitutions. In the first centuries of the Church, the one generally began with the other. Most, if not all, of the congregations which go to form the canonical order had, or still have, a correlative congregation for women.\n\nSome communities of canonesses developed unenclosed institutes of Religious Sisters to complement their activity. The Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, grew from the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Congregation of Our Lady, with the same goal of free education for the poor.\n\nIn a similar manner, in 1897, the Canonesses of St. Augustine in Belgium answered the request of a missionary priest in Mulagumudu, India, for help with an orphanage he ran there. They sent several of their members to serve at this facility. Although they found, upon their arrival, that the priest had since died, they took on the care of the orphans he left behind. Not long after their arrival, and led by their Mother Superior, Mother Marie Louise De Meester, the Sisters went on to form an independent religious congregation called the Missionary Canonesses of St. Augustine, composed of many local Indian women as well as Europeans. In 1963, however, inspired by the Scheut Fathers with whom they frequently worked and from whom they received much spiritual support, the congregation chose to drop its monastic element, and transformed itself into the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nIn England the Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre established a school at New Hall; although no longer ministering in the school, what they founded continues to flourish. At one time there was a community at Hoddesdon, devoted to the contemplative life and perpetual Eucharistic Adoration. This convent was a link with the pre-Reformation canonesses, through Sister Elizabeth Woodford, who was professed at Barnharm Priory, Buckinghamshire on 8 December 1519. When the convent was suppressed, in 1539, she went to the Low Countries and was received into the convent of canonesses regular at Saint Ursula's, Louvain. Numerous women followed and a separate English-speaking community was established. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, this community of English canonesses returned to England.\n\nAs with the canons so also among the canonesses, commitment to liturgical prayer, discipline and love of community life at first flourished but then languished, so that in the tenth and eleventh centuries several monasteries became secular and, though living in the same house, no longer observed the spirit of poverty or kept a common table.\n\nThere are canonesses regular as well as canons regular with the apostolic origin being common to both.\n\nCommunities of canonesses regular developed from the groups of women who took the name and the rule of life laid down for the various congregations of canons regular. They would take religious vows and, like the canons, followed the Rule of St. Augustine. They have the same obligation to the Divine Office as do the canons, and like them, the distinctive part of their religious habit is the white, linen rochet over the traditional black tunic. Again, like the canons, some congregations have simply replaced the rochet with a white tunic for their habit. Unlike nuns, whose communities generally followed the Rule of St. Benedict and supported themselves through farming, communities of canonesses would dedicate themselves entirely to various forms of social service, such as nursing or teaching.\n\nIn medieval Europe, many communities arose where unmarried daughters and widows from among the nobility could withdraw to monasteries in which they lived pious lives of devotion, but did not become nuns. As they did not follow a monastic Rule (), they were termed secular canonesses. Generally speaking, these monasteries were entirely composed of aristocrats. Unlike nuns, they took no permanent vows, and were not committed to a life of poverty, or to a common life for eating and sleeping. Essentially they provided a respectable, yet religious, way of life for those women who might not have been desirous of marriage at that stage in their lives, or simply wanted to focus on prayer in a manner befitting their station in life. In some examples they lived in their own houses, and most had servants available. They took no vows of perpetual celibacy (often excepting the abbess, as at Essen Abbey), and thus could leave at any time to marry, which happened not infrequently. An influx of Greek names at Essen suggests that after the death of the Empress Theophanu in 991, a Byzantine princess, her Greek ladies-in-waiting were retired \"en masse\" to Essen, where at this period the powerful abbesses were mostly women from the ruling Ottonian dynasty.\n\nWhere affected by the Protestant Reformation, these communities almost invariably accepted the new faith. Some continued to exist as communities of single women supported by the local rulers. Almost all had ceased to exist by the 20th century.\n\n\nIn 1997 a public association of the faithful, the Norbertine Association of St. Joseph, was established by the Canons Regular of Premontre of St. Michael's Norbertine Abbey in Orange, California. In 2000 the public association took up the common life in Tehachapi, California. In January 2011 the association was recognized as an autonomous priory of Canonesses Regular of Premontre by the Vatican's Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life, the Abbot General and his council of the Norbertine Order and the diocese of Fresno, California. One of two known communities of Canonesses Regular in the United States, they have grown from the original five foundresses to 49 sisters as of September, 2019.\n\nIn 2010, the Sisters in Jesus the Lord, Canonissae in Jesu Domino (CJD), were established as a Public Association of the Faithful by Bishop Robert Finn in the Diocese of Kansas City-St Joseph, Missouri. They are based in Kansas City, Missouri, and have a house in Vladivostok, Russia, where they serve Roman Catholics at Most Holy Mother of God Parish. Their brother community is the Canons Regular of Jesus the Lord, located in Vladivostok, Russia.\n\nIn 2009, the Canonesses of the Mother of God were to be found at Gap in France and are linked to the Canons at Lagrasse.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2326541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326541", "title": "Music theatre", "text": "Music theatre\n\nMusic theatre is a performance genre that emerged over the course of the 20th century, in opposition to more conventional genres like opera and musical theatre. The term came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s to describe an avant-garde approach to instrumental and vocal composition that included non-sonic gesture, movement, costume and other visual elements within the score. These compositions (such as György Ligeti’s \"Aventures\" (1962), Mauricio Kagel’s \"Match\" (1964) and Peter Maxwell Davies’s \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\" (1968)) were intended to be performed on a concert hall stage, potentially as part of a longer programme of pieces.\n\nSince the 1980s, the term music theatre has come to include any live project that uses the techniques and theories of avant-garde theatre and performance art to experiment with new ways of combining music and theatre; this has been extended to include some of the historical works that influenced the music theatre of the 1960s, such as Arnold Schoenberg’s \"Pierrot lunaire\" (1912), Igor Stravinsky’s \"L'Histoire du soldat\" (1918) and Kurt Weill’s \"Mahagonny-Songspiel\" (1927). The unconventional scale and unfamiliar aesthetic language of this work often positions it outside of the established traditions, institutions and discourses of opera and musical theatre. For this reason, the genre has also been called new music theatre and experimental music theatre.\n\nMusic theatre projects are often composer-led, with the composer deciding many elements of the text, staging and design which would usually be determined by a librettist, director or designer. Examples of key music theatre artists who compose and direct their work include Georges Aperghis and Heiner Goebbels. Some music theatre artists, such as Laurie Anderson, Meredith Monk and Robert Ashley, also perform their own work. Other directors of music theatre include Robert Wilson and Christoph Marthaler, and some pieces are created collectively by performance companies such as Poland's Song of the Goat and Germany's Die Maulwerker.\n\nThe validity of music theatre as a genre distinct from opera and musical theatre varies according to the national context. In some countries, like Germany and Belgium, the concept is widely understood and supported by a dedicated infrastructure of festivals, venues and funding bodies; in other countries, it is wholly subsumed within opera, theatre or performance art, or else banished to a marginal status beyond categorisation. Nevertheless, a renewed compositional interest in non-sonic, theatrical and \"performative\" elements from 21st century composers such as Simon Steen-Andersen, Johannes Kreidler and Jennifer Walshe has led to a resurgence in interest in the genre and its history.\n\n\n"}

However, hairdresser Stefan Ackerie stepped in and purchased the Skyneedle, which was then relocated to the Stefan HQ at South Brisbane. After purchase, Stefan added his firm's signature rainbow rings logo to the top of the tower.\n\nThe Skyneedle's light, which is capable of emitting a beam of light that may be seen away, is rarely seen except on special occasions, because of safety concerns for flight paths around Brisbane Airport.\n\nOn 4 November 2006, the Skyneedle caught fire due to an electrical fault, this incident being the second of its kind after a similar fire had broken out in 1988. Subsequent investigations have found that the fault was most likely caused by bird droppings. Ackerie has stated that it will be restored to its former glory. On 5 November 2006, Ackerie revealed that the Skyneedle will be technologically overhauled with the additional feature of a sound system.\n\nOn 14 March 2009, the top 22-metre section of the Skyneedle was removed. Stefan announced that the section was being rebuilt with new laser technology. The Skyneedle, with its new technology, made its debut on Thursday 23 April 2009 but was officially activated on Friday 1 May by Stefan and Channel Nine weatherman Garry Youngberry on the 6pm news. The new lightshow includes an RGB LED display strip from Italy and a powerful set of German-made spotlights.

The house stands on a plateau which shelves steeply down to the River Thames to the south.\n\nThe house is located on the site of a large multivallate hillfort known as Danesfield Camp, which originally had ramparts to north, east and west. Chalk cliffs to the south form a roughly rectangular plateau. Antiquarian Thomas Langley reported in 1797 that the site was a Danish encampment (hence \"Danes-field\"), but that interpretation was challenged by later finds of artefacts from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. Medmenham Camp, a slight univallate hillfort, lies about 1 km to the west. Both are scheduled ancient monuments.\n\nThe estate was acquired by Edmund Medlycott in 1664. He and his family occupied a farmhouse here, known as Medlycotts. The house was rented to Mrs Morton in 1725. Her son, John Morton, was a barrister and became Attorney-General to Queen Charlotte and Chief Justice of Chester (1762–1780). He also sat as Member of Parliament for Abingdon (1747–1770), New Romney (1770–1774) and Wigan (1775–1780). He acquired the estate's freehold in 1750, and later added extra land. He also bought the ruins of nearby Medmenham Abbey in 1778. He had the existing house demolished and built a new one which he named Danesfield. This house stood to the north of the prehistoric ramparts.\n\nMorton's widow sold the estate to Robert Scott of Wimpole Street in 1787. Scott rebuilt the house in a typical Georgian classical style. The estate eventually passed to his nephew, Charles Robert Scott-Murray, MP for Buckinghamshire from 1841 to 1845. After he converted to Catholicism in 1845, he added a chapel to the house, one of the last designs by Augustus Pugin. Scott-Murray died in August 1882.\n\nThe house was let for a period. In the spring of 1894, Danesfield House was rented by Mrs. William Kissam Vanderbilt (Alva Belmont), mother of Consuelo Vanderbilt, the future Duchess of Marlborough, after a cruise in the Mediterranean aboard the Vanderbilt yacht \"Valiant\" ended abruptly and Mrs. Vanderbilt began considering divorce. The property was sold in 1897 to Robert William Hudson, son and heir of Victorian soap entrepreneur Robert Spear Hudson.\n\nA new house in a Neo-Tudor style was built from 1899–1901, designed by architect W. H. Romaine-Walker. This building was constructed in the northwestern quarter of the prehistoric ramparts, with the western ramparts being levelled to improve access. When the new building was completed, the old house and chapel were demolished. Shortly after it was completed, the estate was sold by Husdon to a property speculator, Mr Hossack, and then to Mrs Arthur Hornby Lewis.\n\nMrs Hornby Lewis died in 1930 and left the estate on trust for her 16-year-old grand niece Elizabeth Whitelaw. The trustees sold the estate in 1938 before she took possession. It was bought and renovated by Stanley Garton, but the Second World War intervened, and it became the temporary home of 80 boys from Colet Court prep school, evacuated from Hammersmith.\n\nThe house was requisitioned by the Air Ministry for the RAF to set up a Joint Service Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) Unit and was known as RAF Medmenham. Danesfield House was to IMINT, what Bletchley Park was to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). The RAF added many temporary wooden structures, and it was bought by the Air Ministry in 1948 to become the divisional headquarters for No. 90 Group RAF (Signals). The house was officers' accommodation, with the Grand Banqueting Hall used as the officers' mess.\n\nThe house was sold to the milk processing company Carnation in 1977, to become its corporate headquarters. It became a country house hotel in 1991. It is a Grade II* listed building. The north and west lodges, steps, walls and fountain in the garden are Grade II listed.\n\n"}

He then apologised on behalf of the British Government.\n\nThe report of the inquiry was published on 15 June 2010. That morning thousands of people walked the path that the civil rights marchers had taken on Bloody Sunday before 13 were killed, holding photos of those who had been shot. The families of the victims received advance copies inside the Guildhall.\n\nThe report stated, \"The firing by soldiers of 1 PARA on Bloody Sunday caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury,\" and also said, \"The immediate responsibility for the deaths and injuries on Bloody Sunday lies with those members of Support Company whose unjustifiable firing was the cause of those deaths and injuries.\" Saville stated that British paratroopers \"lost control\", fatally shooting fleeing civilians and those who tried to aid the civilians who had been shot by the British soldiers. The report stated that British soldiers had concocted lies in their attempt to hide their acts. Saville stated that the civilians had not been warned by the British soldiers that they intended to shoot. The report states, contrary to the previously established belief, that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks by petrol bombers or stone throwers, and that the civilians were not posing any threat.\n\nSaville said British soldiers should not have been ordered to enter the Bogside area as \"Colonel Wilford either deliberately disobeyed Brigadier MacLellan’s order or failed for no good reason to appreciate the clear limits on what he had been authorised to do\". The report stated five British soldiers aimed shots at civilians they knew did not pose a threat and two other British soldiers shot at civilians \"in the belief that they might have identified gunmen, but without being certain that this was the case\".\n\nThe report found that Martin McGuinness \"did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.\"\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, addressing the House of Commons after the publication of the report on 15 June 2010, described what British soldiers had done as \"both unjustified and unjustifiable, it was wrong\". He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also said that this was not a premeditated action, though \"there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate\" as \"what happened should never, ever have happened\". Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was \"deeply sorry\".\n\nRelatives of the civilians who were fatally shot by the British soldiers gave a \"thumbs up\" to the crowd which gathered outside the Guildhall to hear the conclusions of the report and to listen to Cameron's apology on behalf of the British government. Crowds of people applauded upon hearing Cameron's apology broadcast on a giant screen which had been erected in the city. \"The New York Times\" called it \"an extraordinary apology\". Historian Paul Bew, Baron Bew, writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\", summed up the length of the inquiry as follows: \"It is astonishing to think that when the tribunal, chaired by Lord Saville, began its work in 1998, David Cameron was not even in Parliament. Now, 38 years after the event itself, Bloody Sunday has come back to haunt another British prime minister\".\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" stated that Cameron's apology was following an example set by Labour of \"sealing off nagging historic disputes by saying sorry\". \"The Belfast Telegraph\" quoted Labour MP Harriet Harman as saying that the report spoke for itself, but that given its length, many groups regrettably would likely be spurred to, and be able to, identify enough in the report to justify a predictable \"flogging of traditional hobby horses\".\n\nOne lawyer representing soldiers involved in the enquiry stated that Lord Saville \"cherry picked\" the evidence in his inquiry and that Lord Saville felt under pressure to give a verdict that is not borne out by the available evidence. This view was later echoed by a former paratrooper writing in the \"Belfast Telegraph\" that the Saville Inquiry was one-sided and did not reflect events of the day as he experienced them.\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Sir Reg Empey criticised the inquiry itself, questioning the benefit of reliving the \"darkest years\" of Northern Ireland's history after 40 years, and also contrasting the £190m Saville Inquiry into 13 deaths with the absence of any inquiries into the deaths of people at the hands of paramilitary groups during the same period. This second criticism was also echoed in comments from Protestants reported in \"The Belfast Telegraph\" that the report created an unjust hierarchy in which the victims of Bloody Sunday were unfairly elevated above the more numerous victims of IRA violence.\n\nThe Bloody Sunday Inquiry opened properly in 2000 when formal public hearings began at the Guildhall in Derry. The Inquiry held public hearings on 116 days over the year, clocking up more than 600 hours of evidence. The vast majority of the evidence was from eyewitnesses.\n\nIn August, the inquiry ordered the soldiers who had opened fire to return to Derry to give their evidence. However, in December the Court of Appeal overruled the inquiry and accepted that the former soldiers would be in danger from dissident republicans should they return to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe inquiry heard that there may be a \"wall of silence\" in Derry over what exactly members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) were doing on the day. The allegations persisted when a witness in February 2001 refused to name a man he said had fired at soldiers. After months of speculation, Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness announced that he would give evidence to the inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry relocated to the Westminster Central Hall in London to hear evidence from former British Army soldiers, who claimed they might be attacked by dissident republicans if they travelled to Derry.\n\nJudges retired on 23 November 2004. They reconvened once again on 16 December to listen to testimony from another key witness, known as Witness X.\n\nPublication of the Inquiry's Report was expected at the end of 2007, or possibly early 2008.\n\nOn 8 February 2008, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Shaun Woodward revealed that the Bloody Sunday Inquiry was still costing £500,000 a month although it had not held hearings since 2005. The total cost of the Inquiry had reached £181.2m (by December 2007) and would not report until the second half of 2008. More than half of the overall cost is believed to be legal bills for the Inquiry.\nOn 6 November 2008, the chairman of the Inquiry, Lord Saville, revealed that his report into the events of Bloody Sunday would not be completed for at least another year. The inquiry's final report had been expected to be completed by the end of 2008 and published in early 2009.\n\nThe chairman of the inquiry, Lord Saville, revealed that the inquiry would be handed to the government in March 2010, some nine years after the first evidence was heard; a delay which Lord Saville admitted was \"extremely disappointing\". Shaun Woodward said he had been \"profoundly shocked\" by the new delay, adding \"I am concerned at the impact on the families of those who lost loved ones and those who were injured\".\n\nThe Saville Report was handed to government lawyers on 24 March 2010, twelve years after the inquiry was established. The government lawyers then checked the report for evidence which may pose a threat to \"national security\". The report was given to Owen Paterson, the new Secretary of State, who decided on an appropriate date to publish the report. John Kelly, whose brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, said the families feared the report \"will fall victim to selective leakage and other partisan usage long before the full report sees the light of day\" and urged the Secretary of State to publish the report as soon as possible. On 26 May 2010 it was announced that the Saville Report would be published on 15 June. Comments in the press emphasised the financial cost of the inquiry, and the ways in which this could overshadow its legal and moral value.\n\nShortly before the publication of the long-awaited Saville Report, it was announced that soldiers from the Parachute Regiment would return to Helmand in Afghanistan on operations for the third time in four years in October and commanders believed that the report could cause a \"morale-damaging backlash\" against the British Army if the reports were not viewed in the context of the violence and chaos that engulfed Northern Ireland in 1972 and that while there should be no attempt to justify the killing of civilians by British paratroopers, senior defence officials emphasised that the events of Bloody Sunday were \"a tragedy which belonged to another era\" and should not reflect badly on the present day's armed forces.\n\nThe Bloody Sunday Inquiry has generated controversy due to its prolonged nature, mounting costs and questions regarding its relevance.\n\nSome like Peter Oborne have labelled the inquiry a \"shambles\", estimating its final cost at \"more than £200 million\". He has suggested that while \"Most people... accept that in Northern Ireland the only way forward is by casting a veil of obscurity over the past\": however the Saville inquiry marks the \"one exception to this rule: the British army\"; whose \"conduct... is being put under a microscope by the Saville public inquiry\".\n\nThe inquiry caused further controversy when on 4 July 2006 the Government revealed its cost to the taxpayer in an attempt \"to block an official inquiry into the 7 July London bombings\". \"Tessa Jowell, let slip on BBC TV's \"Sunday AM\" programme that 'the latest estimate... is about £400 million'\": an amount labelled by \"Downing Street and ministers\" as an \"'awful' cost\":\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2326576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326576", "title": "Ullage", "text": "Ullage\n\nUllage or headspace is the unfilled space in a container, particularly with a liquid.\n\nThe word comes ultimately from the Latin \"oculus\", “eye”, which was used in a figurative sense by the Romans for the bung hole of a barrel. This was taken into French in the medieval period as \"oeil\", from which a verb \"ouiller\" was created, to fill a barrel up to the bung hole. In turn, a noun \"ouillage\" was created, which was the immediate source of the word's modern form, first recorded in Norman English about 1300, at first in the sense of the amount of liquid needed to fill a barrel up to the bung hole.\n\nBy an obvious extension, \"ullage\" came to refer to any amount by which a barrel is unfilled, perhaps because some of the contents have been used. It is also applied to the unfilled air space at the top of a bottle of wine, which in this case is essential to allow for expansion of the contents as the temperature changes.\n\nBy further extension, in brewing and beer retail, \"ullage\" is the residue of beer left in a barrel that has been emptied. When calculating tax returns and the like, licensed premises owners, landlords or managers can factor in the duty on \"ullage\", or unavoidable barrel wastage.\n\"Ullage\" therefore has come to be used as a general term, in the licensed trade, for waste beer whether at the barrel or at the bar tap or pump. However, what customers leave in their glasses does not count as ullage, because it has been sold.\n\nLiquid propellant rockets store their propellants in tanks. Cryogenic tanks are never completely filled, to prevent severe pressure drop in the tank after engine start. On the ground, the space between the top of the propellant load and the top of the tank is known as \"ullage space\". Ullage pressure is a critical measurable during powered rocket flight, because it affects tank structural integrity and engine Net Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP). \n\nIn the weightless condition in space without engine thrust, empty space occurs in partially filled tanks, and the liquid floats away from the engine intake, which is undesirable for stable engine operation. Small rocket engines are sometimes used to provide enough acceleration to settle the propellant to the bottom of the tanks prior to ignition of the main engine(s). Engines devoted to this purpose are called ullage motors; sometimes reaction control system thrusters are used.\n\n\"Ullage\" is also widely used in industrial or marine settings to describe the empty space in large tanks or holds used to store or carry liquids or bulk solids such as grain. In accordance with IMO regulations, the Code of Federal Regulations, and the ABS Rules for Steel Vessels, certain pressurized tanks on steel ships may not be filled greater than 98% full, although there are exceptions. This is so that the pressure relief valve is always in contact with a gas or vapor. Certain pressure relief valves for chemical use are not designed to relieve the pressure when in contact with liquids.\n\nIn some cases, the ullage in a ship's hold can be relevant to stability; liquid or dry bulk cargo in a part-filled hold can shift asymmetrically towards one side as the ship heels to one side and the other, reducing the margin of stability when compared with a full hold. Excessive ullage in a tank may contribute to the free surface effect. When referring to the free surface effect, the condition of a tank that is not full is described as a \"slack tank\", while a full tank is \"pressed up\".\n\n"}

There are currently around 1750 students and 250 teachers and staff.\n\nHinckley Grammar School was first mentioned in the parish records of 1629, though it was certainly in existence before this time. It was on Castle Road at the centre of Hinckley. However, in 1791 it was noted by the \"Universal British Directory\" that \"The old town hall and school house remain, but are ruinous\". In 1831 it was noted by the same organisation as \"In a very dilapidated state\", and the old grammar school was pulled down 21 years later in 1852, eventually being replaced by houses and shops. In 1877 a new school was opened, which in 1891 had 50 pupils, and which in 1894 moved to new purpose built premises on Leicester Road, close to the current site. In 1901 the school admitted girls.

He commanded the Baltic Sea Division, which successfully intervened in the Finnish Civil War in the spring of 1918. Goltz stayed with his troops in Finland until December 1918 representing German interests, and in practise ruled the country as a military dictator during this period. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, Goltz commanded the army of the Baltic German-established Government of Latvia, which in 1919 was instrumental in the defeat of the Russian Bolsheviks and their local allies in Latvia, but suffered a defeat against Estonia and was eventually unsuccessful in retaining German control over the Baltic region after the War.\n\nGoltz was born in Züllichau, Brandenburg. A Major-General commanding the German infantry division of Guards on Foot in France, he was transferred to Finland in March 1918 to help the nationalist government in the civil war against the Finnish \"Reds\" and Soviet Russian troops. He commanded the German expedition unit (\"Baltic Sea Division\") which landed at Hanko, Finland, between 3 April and 5 April 1918, and then marched on the socialist-controlled capital Helsinki, which surrendered after the Battle of Helsinki on 13 April 1918. The German military intervention aided the nationalist government of Finland to gain control over most of the country by May 1918. Goltz stayed with his troops in Finland after the Civil War until December 1918 and was a major political influence in the country, described by the Quartermaster General of the White Army Hannes Ignatius as being the \"true regent of Finland\". In the summer of 1918, Goltz wanted to replace the Finnish White forces with a new Finnish conscript army, where all leadership positions were to be staffed by German officers and conscripts were to be trained according to German army standards. Finnish generals Ignatius, von Gerich and Theslöf resigned from the Finnish military staff in protest. The Germans wanted to use Finnish forces against the Allied units intervening in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.\n\nAfter the 11 November 1918, armistice, von der Goltz and his division left Helsinki on 16 December 1918. The Inter-Allied Commission of Control insisted that the German troops remain in the Baltic states to prevent the region from being re-occupied by the Red Army. As many of the demoralised German soldiers were being withdrawn from Latvia, a Freikorps unit called the Iron Division (\"Eiserne Division\") was formed and deployed in Riga and used to delay the Red advance. New volunteers arriving from Germany and remnants of the German 8th Army were subsequently added to the Iron Division, which was assigned under the command of Goltz. Also, Baltic Germans and some Latvians formed the \"Baltische Landeswehr\", led by Major Alfred Fletcher.\n\nIn late February 1919, only the seaport of Libau (Liepāja) remained in the hands of the German and Latvian forces. In March 1919, General von der Goltz was able to win a series of victories over the Red Army, first occupying Windau (Ventspils), the major port of Courland, and then advancing south and east to retake Riga.\n\nAfter the Bolsheviks had been driven out from most of Latvia, the Allies ordered the German government to withdraw its troops from the Baltic region. However, the Germans succeeded in negotiating a postponement, arguing that this would have given the Bolsheviks a free hand. General von der Goltz then attempted to seize control of Latvia with the assistance of the local German population. The Latvian nationalist government was deposed while the Freikorps, Latvian and White Russian units moved on to capture Riga on May 23, 1919. The Latvian nationalists sought assistance from the Estonian army which had been occupying northern Latvia since earlier that year.\n\nIn June 1919, General von der Goltz ordered his troops not to advance east against the Red Army, as the Allies had been expecting, but north, against the Estonians. On June 19, the Iron Division and \"Landeswehr\" units launched an attack to capture areas around Wenden (Cēsis), but in the battles over the following few days, they were defeated by the 3rd Estonian Division (led by Ernst Põdder). On the morning of June 23, the Germans began a general retreat toward Riga. The Allies again insisted that the Germans withdraw their remaining troops from Latvia and intervened to impose a ceasefire between the Estonians and the Freikorps when the Latvians were about to march into Riga. The British insisted that General von der Goltz leave Latvia, and he turned his troops over to the West Russian Volunteer Army.\n\nCount von der Goltz later claimed in his memoirs that his major strategic goal in 1919 had been to launch a campaign in cooperation with the White Russian forces to overturn the Bolshevik regime by marching on St. Petersburg and to install a pro-German anti-Bolshevist government in Russia.\n\nAs President of the United Patriotic Organizations he participated in the Harzburg Front in the early thirties.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1930, he headed the German government department on the military education of young German youth. On 17 July 1931 he handed over the command of the Economic Policy Association Frankfurt am Main to the Reich President Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nHe was married to Hannah Caroline von Hase (1873–1941), a granddaughter of Karl Hase. He died on the Kinsegg estate, in the village of Bernbeuren, Germany, in 1946. His son of the same name, Rüdiger von der Goltz, became a lawyer.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest church in the state of Indiana, and in 2007 was the 20th largest in the United States. Though founded in 1887 by Allen Hill, it was under Jack Hyles' leadership from 1959–2001 when it became one of the megachurches in the United States and during the 1970s had the highest Sunday school attendance of any church in the world. In 1990, the church had a weekly attendance of 20,000. It also operates Hyles-Anderson College, a non-accredited institution established for the training of pastors and missionaries, and two K-12 schools, called City Baptist Schools (for children of the bus route of the church) and Hammond Baptist Schools (for children of the members of the church). John Wilkerson is the senior pastor at First Baptist Church.\n\nFirst Baptist Church was founded in November 1887 by Allen Hill of Jennings County, Indiana. Its first meeting was on November 14, 1887 with 12 members on the 28th. However, it originally met in the Morton House Hotel which stood on what is currently the 100 block of Willow Court. Allen Hill's pastorate was short lived at approximately 4 months.\n\nBy April 1888, B.P. Hewitt became the church's permanent pastor and Allen Hill went on to start several other churches. Needing more room, Hewitt moved the church's meeting place to the Hohman Opera House at the corner of State and Hohman. In 1889, the church erected its own structure for $2,358 when Marcus Towle, Hammond's first mayor and member of FBC, donated land on Sibley Street to the church.\n\nSubsequently, on January 3, 1901 Pastor E.T. Carter proposed a new building, and the first service was held on April 14, 1901. On November 27 of that same year, Carter announced his resignation for a job at the Central Baptist Orphanage in Michigan.\n\nDuring the early and mid 1970s the church's Sunday school used carnival-like entertainment along with free transportation by a fleet of over 200 buses to attract thousands of people from the Chicago Southland and northern Indiana. In 1975 weekly attendance was at 14,000, with a peak of over 30,000 in March of that year. \"Time\" magazine described the church's claim of having the \"world's largest Sunday school\" as \"rock solid for the U.S., if not the world.\"\n\nIn January 2013, John Wilkerson became pastor of Hammond, following a January 13, 2013 service with a 94% of the 2,078 members' votes. Wilkerson was previously connected to the church, notably Wilkerson graduated from Hyles-Anderson College in 1989, and his wife Linda graduated in 1990.\n\nFirst Baptist Church has several outreach ministries, including Prepare Now Resources, Hyles-Anderson College (not accredited by any recognized accreditation body), Fundamental Baptist Missions International, Hammond Baptist Schools, City Baptist Schools, Chicago Baptist Academy, Memory Lane Cemetery, Christian Womanhood Magazine, First Baptist Church Little League, Nursing Home Ministry, Sailor Ministry, Truck Driver's Ministry, Bus Ministry, Blind Ministry, Pathfinder Ministry (Educable Slow), Homeless Ministry, Rescue Mission, Public School Ministry, Inner City Chapel Ministry, and Deaf Ministry. The church also has several services in Spanish and some Asian languages.\n\nUntil 2011, First Baptist Church also hosted three national conferences. The first Pastors' School invites pastors, assistant pastors, Christian leaders, school administrators, and Christian laymen to a week of training and learning. Its Youth Conference is held in mid-July and is for the youth and teenagers of Christian churches nationally. The final conference of the year, held every October, was the \"Christian Womenhood Spectacular\" for Christian women of all ages. Currently only the Youth Conference is regularly conducted.\n\n48th Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the church on September 2011, when he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana.\n\nEvery Memorial Day, the church and Hyles-Anderson College students and officials honor veterans of a particular conflict at Memorial Park. In 2008, the group honored those who died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in 2009, veterans of the Korean War were honored.\n\nIn 1989, the paper \"The Biblical Evangelist\" published a story \"The Saddest Story We Ever Published\", accusing Jack Hyles of sexual scandals, financial misappropriation and doctrinal errors. These charges were denied by Hyles who deemed them \"lies\".\n\nIn 1991, a First Baptist Church of Hammond deacon molested a 7-year-old girl in her Hammond Sunday school class. During a Sunday school class \"a church worker reportedly witnessed the act and removed the girl from the room, police said.\" The \"Chicago Tribune\" in a 1991 article reported that Hyles was sued for $1 million by the parents of the girl. The paper reported the \"lawsuit claims Hyles and the church had not fulfilled their obligation to ensure that children were protected from harm during Sunday school.\" Furthermore, the lawsuit \"claims the minister told the child's parents that Ballenger 'just loved children,' and, 'You don't have a case.'\" The church settled the lawsuit out of court and the terms were not disclosed. At the criminal trial, three young women testified deacon A.V. Ballenger \"had fondled them years ago.\" One of those girls testified that she was molested on the Hammond church bus. A former security officer at the church testified he saw Ballenger fondle a young girl in 1978 or 1979 in a Sunday school room after being called to the room by a female teacher. In 1993, Ballenger was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nIn 1993, WJBK aired Preying from the Pulpit, a news series, examined \"allegations of child molesting, abuse and sex scandals in several churches across the nation appear to be part of a pattern of such scandals among churches affiliated with the First Baptist Church of Hammond.\" It examined fresh claims of sex abuse in five different fundamentalist churches where church workers who molested children were traced back to Hyles-Anderson College. Besides the abuse, the program examined Hyles' teaching, including a 1990 sermon where \"Hyles pretended to pour poison into a glass and asked an associate pastor, Johnny Colsten, to drink from it. Colsten said he would.\" The report \"said the sermon has the 'ring of Jonestown' to it—the mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 by followers of cult leader Jim Jones.\" Hyles called the program \"poor journalism\" and organized a national campaign to respond.\n\nIn 1997, Hyles and the First Baptist Church of Hammond were sued \"for negligence in connection with alleged sexual assaults on a mentally disabled church member over a six-year period\" The lawyer for the woman, Vernon Petri, \"says Hyles is a defendant because he failed to protect the woman\", such that \"controls have to be set to be sure things are conducted appropriately.\" However, \"Christianity Today\" pointed out that no criminal charges were ever filed in the case. Also, Hyles denied the allegations that either he or his church were negligent in the care of the woman in an October 12 advertisement in the Hammond Times. According to the lawyer, \"a church program instructor led her to a room and served as a lookout while two to three males raped her.\" The women developed a \"serious\" infection and doctors \"found, embedded in her, a plastic object.\" The \"civil suit filed in Lake Superior Court in Gary claims the Chicago woman was \"induced by agents\" of the church in 1991 to ride a bus to attend Sunday.\" The women and church settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAfter Hyles' death in 2001, Jack Schaap, Hyles' son-in-law, succeeded as pastor. Schaap's sermons were controversial. On July 31, 2012 Schaap was fired \"due to a sin that has caused him to forfeit his right to be our pastor\". Schaap reportedly admitted to deacons of the church that he had an adulterous affair with the young woman, who was 16 years old at the time. Since 16 is the age of consent in Indiana, sex with the girl would not have constituted statutory rape. The case was turned over to the Lake County Sheriff's Department (Indiana) for investigation.\n\nIn September 2012, Schaap was charged in a U.S. District Court for taking a minor across state lines to have sex with her (the Mann Act) and pleaded guilty.\n\nIn October, nearly a quarter of the Hammond church staff were laid off. An article in the January 2013 issue of Chicago Magazine about First Baptist Church stated, \"A string of assaults and sexual crimes committed by pastors across the country have one thing in common: The perpetrators have ties to the megachurch in Hammond, Indiana.\"\n\nIn January 2013, Schaap asked the court for the minimum 10-year sentence, claiming he was under great stress, exhausted and depressed at the time of the relationship. In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors revealed that Schaap \"groomed\" the girl, including kissing the victim during counseling and had sex with her in his office. In March 2013, Schaap was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for having sex with an underage girl.\n\n"}

He spent most of his career on the labels Definitive Jux and Eastern Conference. He has released four solo albums, from \"Movies for the Blind\" (2002) to \"Kill the Architect\" (2013), in addition to two compilation albums and two extended plays.\n\nAside from his solo career, Cage is one of the founders of the underground hip hop supergroup The Weathermen, which was formed in 1999. He also established a group called Smut Peddlers, with hip hop duo The High & Mighty, publishing an album titled \"Porn Again\", in 2001. He is also known for his collaborations with New Jersey rapper Tame One; the two are collectively known as Leak Bros. Cage and Camu Tao made up the duo Nighthawks, who released an eponymous 2002 album.\n\nChris Palko was born in Würzburg, West Germany, to American parents. His father was stationed on a West German military base as a member of the military police. Palko lived there until the age of four when his father was dishonorably discharged for selling and using heroin, and the family was sent back to the United States where they lived in Middletown, New York. His father would often force Palko to pull homemade tourniquets around his arm as he injected heroin. At the age of eight, Palko's father was arrested during a standoff with state troopers after threatening his family with a shotgun. By the time Palko was expelled from high school, his mother had remarried twice, and he was beaten by his stepfather Frank. Palko began using PCP, cocaine, LSD, cannabis and alcohol, and was sent to live with his uncle on a German military base, where he was beaten and sent home after a year.\n\nPalko was arrested several times for drug possession and fighting in the streets. When he faced jail time for violating probation, his mother convinced the judge that he was mentally unstable, and he was sent to the Stony Lodge psychiatric hospital for a two-week evaluation. He stayed in the hospital for sixteen months, where he was a part of a small group used to test fluoxetine, commonly known as Prozac. After being misdiagnosed and placed on the drug, he became suicidal and made several attempts to kill himself, including hanging himself with his shoelaces and saving his lithium dose for a month before ingesting all of them at once.\n\nWhen Palko was released from the hospital at eighteen, he pursued a career as a rapper, giving himself the stagename \"Alex\", after the protagonist of Anthony Burgess' novel \"A Clockwork Orange\". After hiring a manager and recording a demo, he was introduced to rapper Pete Nice, and Cage was featured on the 1993 album \"Dust to Dust\". Pete Nice also introduced Palko to radio personality Bobbito García, who featured Palko on his program several times, increasing his reputation among New York's underground hip hop scene, where he became associated with KMD, Kurious Jorge, K-Solo, Godfather Don, Necro, Artifacts, Pharoahe Monch and El-P. Palko signed a recording contract with Columbia Records, but frequently recorded while intoxicated, and the label found his efforts to be unsatisfactory. Palko briefly put his career on hold and his drug use increased. He became father to a daughter in 1994.\n\nWhen García founded the label Fondle 'Em Records, he offered Palko a record deal, and Cage released a single featuring the songs \"Radiohead\" and \"Agent Orange\" in 1997, to success and acclaim. Following the release of \"Slim Shady EP\" in December 1997, Palko accused Detroit-based rapper Eminem of imitating his style.\n\nAfter several more singles with Fondle 'Em, Palko met Mr. Eon and DJ Mighty Mi of The High & Mighty, and the trio formed the group Smut Peddlers, releasing the album \"Porn Again\" on Rawkus Records in 2001. The album peaked at #10 on the \"Billboard\" Heatseekers chart, #43 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #184 on the \"Billboard\" 200, while its single \"That Smut\" peaked at #9 on the Hot Rap Singles chart and #96 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. In 2001, Palko's music was featured on the soundtrack to the psychological crime film \"Bully\".\n\nPalko signed with The High & Mighty's Eastern Conference Records, releasing his debut album, \"Movies for the Blind\", on August 6, 2002. It peaked at #12 on the Heatseekers chart, #14 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #58 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #193 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Palko later stated, in 2006, that the album \"sort of glorified drugs\" and that he felt the album was \"crazy for the sake of being crazy [...] . During this period, Palko formed the group The Weathermen, named after the left-wing political organization. The group released their debut album \"The Conspiracy\" on June 3, 2003, before Palko left Eastern Conference over alleged non-payment. An extended play, titled \"Weatherproof\", was released on July 29, 2003. During his time on Eastern Conference, Interscope Records showed interest in signing Cage despite Eminem also being on their label, but ended their interest after judging that he would not attract a mainstream audience.\n\nBecause Palko felt that he should no longer play a character, he began to take on a more open writing style, and signed with Definitive Jux, where he released his second studio album \"Hell's Winter\", on September 20, 2005. Palko is quoted as saying \"I make progressive rap, it's as simple as that. [...] I don't live for drugs anymore, I don't support them, and I'm not about to make a million songs about them anymore.\" He also said that he would no longer make battle rap or music that offends women.\"Hell's Winter\" peaked at #26 on the Top Heatseekers chart and at #36 on the Top Independent Albums chart.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with American actor Shia LaBeouf, for \"Vanity Fair\", LaBeouf expressed interest in starring as Palko in a possible film biography. On November 30, 2007, \"Spin\" reported that the film would go into production.\n\nIn July 2009, Palko released his third studio album \"Depart from Me\", which he characterized as having a rap rock sound. LaBeouf directed the music video for the song \"I Never Knew You\". Cage's mental health was affected by the suffering and death of best friend and collaborator Camu Tao during the recording process.\n\nIn late 2010, Palko appeared on American recording artist Kid Cudi's second album \"\", making a guest appearance on a track titled \"Maniac\". The two performed \"Maniac\", alongside indie rock musician St. Vincent, on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" in November of that year. In March 2011, Cudi announced he would be releasing a short film inspired by the song \"Maniac\", co-starring Palko and directed by Shia LaBeouf, in October 2011. On October 30, 2011, as promised Cudi released \"Maniac\", a short horror film, premiered via his blog.\n\nDespite previously having a falling out with The High & Mighty, Palko announced in 2012, he would reunite with producer DJ Mighty Mi, to release a single titled \"The Void\", which was released on April 3, 2012 on Tribute Records. Palko also started a new project with Sean Martin, called We Sold Our Souls, who released their first song \"Super Baked\" in March 2012. Cage also announced he would release material under an alter ego, Sam Hill, with lyrics on topics similar to his early efforts on \"Movies For the Blind\". On August 23, 2013, it was announced that the album \"Kill the Architect\" would be released on October 22, 2013 with Eastern Conference. A song from the album, \"The Hunt\", was released on the same day.\n\nPalko had two further supporting roles in independent films: Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead's critically acclaimed romantic horror \"Spring\" (2014) and Amber Tamblyn's drama \"Paint It Black\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2326645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326645", "title": "Howe and Hummel", "text": "Howe and Hummel\n\nHowe and Hummel was a New York City law firm, celebrated in the latter half of the nineteenth century and principally renowned for its active involvement in the world of crime and corruption.\n\nThe senior partner in the firm was William F. Howe (1828 – September 2, 1902), a corpulent UK-born and later naturalized American trial lawyer who had served 18 months in jail in Britain for false representation, and who was strongly suspected of possessing a more extensive criminal background. Prosecuted in 1874 by a pair of white slavers, William and Adelaide Beaumont, \"who maintained that they had in some fashion been cheated by the partners\",\n\nIn 1869, Howe made a partner of Abraham Hummel (July 27, 1850 – January 21, 1926), his physical opposite and former clerk, a runtish, rake-thin genius renowned for his ability to spot loopholes in the law.\n\nHowe handled most of the firm's criminal work, participating in more than 600 murder trials in the course of his fifty-year career and winning a large but unstated proportion of them. He was noted for his extravagant dress, favoring bright waistcoats and large jeweled rings—although he steadily dressed down as a capital trial progressed, invariably ending it in a funereal suit and black tie. He had a markedly florid rhetorical style, on one occasion delivering an entire summing-up, two hours, while on his knees before the jury box. One of his most remarked upon talents was an apparent ability to weep at will, although legal historian Sadakat Kadri notes that his frequent opponent Francis L. Wellman \"suspected that he used an onion-scented handkerchief to get in the mood\". The less extrovert but more intelligent Hummel specialized in civil law and ran the firm's thriving blackmail racket, representing chorus girls and thwarted lovers, threatening married men with exposure and well-off young bachelors with suits for breach of promise of marriage.\n\nAt its peak, operating from offices just across the road from NYPD headquarters on Centre Street, Howe and Hummel received fat retainers from a significant proportion of the criminals, brothel-keepers, and abortionists of New York. All 74 madams rounded up during a purity drive in 1884 named Howe and Hummel as their counsel, and at one time the firm represented 23 out of the 25 prisoners awaiting trial for murder in the city's Tombs prison and had an undeclared interest in the twenty-fourth.\n\nBill Howe's persuasive abilities were the stuff of legend. Perhaps his most notable achievement was to get a client, Ella Nelson, acquitted on a charge of willful murder. Howe admitted that the girl had been armed with a revolver, but successfully persuaded a jury that her trigger finger had accidentally slipped not just once, but four times in the course of an argument with her married lover.\n\nAnother of Howe's most spectacular defenses, according to the \"New York Tribune\" of 2 September 1902:\n\nOne of Howe's most notorious cases, however, may have been that of John Dolan, convicted in the murder of merchant James H. Noe. Despite a desperate legal to save his life, Dolan went to the gallows on April 21, 1875. \"New York Times\" coverage of the case, which riveted New York for several months, identifies one William F. Howe as Dolan's attorney. In a noticeable omission, it does not mention Dolan in its obituary for Howe.\n\nAmong Abe Hummel's most celebrated achievements was the discovery of an error in procedure that led to the release of 240 of the 300 prisoners on Blackwell's Island in a single day. On another occasion, the partners invoked a technicality that, had it been allowed, would have set free every prisoner awaiting trial, or recently convicted, of first degree murder in the state of New York, and made it impossible for the authorities to obtain further capital convictions for murder for a period of several months.\n\nThe final collapse of the firm came in 1907, five years after Howe's death, when Hummel was convicted in New York of suborning perjury, disbarred, and sentenced to a year in jail. After his release, Hummel left the United States and lived chiefly in Paris.\n\nHowe and Hummel kept no records, actively courted publicity, and were much discussed in their day among the members of the legal profession. As such, many of the stories told about them have the aura of tall tales. Nevertheless, their decades of effective practice suggest that the partners were among the most effective and innovative attorneys to practice in the United States during the nineteenth century.\n\nAlthough nobody can deny a strong element of \"sharp practice\", including using suspect surprise witnesses in some trials, there was genuine talent in the team, especially in the abilities of William Howe in court. A recent study of the 1897 murder of Willie Guldensuppe, and the 1898 trial of his killer Martin Thorne, gives clear proof of Howe's mastery of cross-examination. At the first trial of Thorne his co-conspirator, Mrs. Augusta Nack, testified against Thorne. Howe's simple and direct cross-examination ripped her apart on the stand, which led to the prosecution deciding not to use her again in a retrial. Thorne was convicted and sentenced to be executed in the second trial.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2326651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326651", "title": "Les Gets", "text": "Les Gets\n\nLes Gets is a commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France.\n\nThe village's first single-person chair lift was opened in 1938 with the first chair lift on Mont Chéry in 1954.\n\nLes Gets is situated on the col between Taninges and Morzine, at the western edge of the Portes du Soleil ski area.\n\nLes Gets contains a museum of Mechanical Music and hosts a festival of Mechanical Music bi-annually. This has been running for 25 years. During this period the streets are closed off and barrel organs or \"orgues\" fill the streets with mechanical music. Many of the organ grinders come from other European countries, such as Germany and Holland.\n\nTraditional Savoy dishes are central to Les Gets cuisine. These include \"tartiflette\", a dish of potatoes \"au gratin\" with reblochon cheese and lardons. A traditional liqueur, \"génépi\", is also often drunk as a digestif, although the exact constitution of this medicinal drink varies as many residents produce their own.\n\nThere are many restaurants ranging from the family-friendly and reasonably priced to fairly top-end. They mostly specialise in local savoyard cuisine.\n\nLes Gets has many pubs and bars. In the summer, there are all kinds of evening activities in the centre of town, ranging from discos to the \"Pot de Bienvenue\" (a welcome drink) on a Monday evening. A lot of emphasis is given to children's entertainment, such as wooden games set out in the street, street performers and a carousel. Live bands regularly perform on the semi-permanent stage in the centre of the village, attracting both locals and tourists.\n\nIn the summer, Les Gets hosts many downhill mountain biking events. There are two distinct downhill mountain bike areas, one on each side of the village. The downhill mountain bike run on Mt Chéry has been used in the Mountain Bike World Cups in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, and in the Mountain Bike World Championships in 2004.\n\nLes Gets has an 18-hole par 70 golf course long, which overlooks Mont Blanc. In the winter it forms part of the pistes.\n\nLes Gets is a linked ski resort within the Portes du Soleil. Lift passes can be purchased for Les Gets and the neighbouring area of Morzine, or for the wider Portes du Soleil. Combined, Morzine and Les Gets have around 50 lifts across several distinct ski areas. Lift passes for Mont Chéry (at one side of Les Gets) can also be purchased for that area only.\n\nThe ski area consists mainly of blue and red runs (beginner and intermediate). There is an area known as \"The Bowl\" into which numerous ski runs and chairlifts feed. Also in this area are the resort's most easily accessible black runs: 'Yeti', accessed via the resort's slowest chairlift, La Rosta, and Myrtilles accessed by the Grains d'Or Express. Mont Chéry hosts the majority of black runs, also having numerous red runs, with just one blue and no green pistes. It is the \"locals'\" mountain, Les Chavannes being the tourist side.\n\nThere are several spots for off-piste skiing and snowboarding, including to the sides of 'Yeti', the long black run off Chamossiere and one a short hike from the top of the Ranfoilly lift. The latter has been rated as one of the best off-piste powder bowls in Europe (although there is very often a medium chance of avalanches).\n\nThe snowpark is located on Mont Chéry, which is on the ski area on the other side of the village. A bus connects the two sides, however it takes just as long as it does to walk. The snowpark has kickers, a spine, rails, boxes, a boarder cross and new for 2007–08 was a large air bag. The park is fairly small and served by a two-man chairlift.\n\nLes Gets has an area of the mountain for children only, le Grande Cry.

As a ministry of the First Baptist Church of Hammond, it focuses on training pastors, missionaries and Christian teachers to work in Independent Baptist schools.\n\nIn 1972, Hyles–Anderson College was founded by Jack Hyles with financial support from Russell Anderson. The school was originally located on a campus known as Baptist City in Schererville, Indiana. HAC's former campus was turned into Hammond Baptist K-12 school. This school is also operated by the First Baptist Church of Hammond.\n\nThe college's first president was Robert J. Billings, who later served as Ronald Reagan's \"liaison to the fundamentalist Christian movement in the 1980 presidential campaign\" and then spent six years in the U.S. Education Department as well as was a founding member of the Moral Majority.\n\nHyles-Anderson alumni have pastored over 572 churches within the US and Guam. Over 123 alumni compose missionary families, church planters, and mission teams around the world with Fundamental Baptist Missions International and many hundreds have teamed up with other mission boards as well. One graduate, Jon Nelms, started the Final Frontiers Foundation mission board, which has led to the creation of over 44,000 churches worldwide.\n\nWhen Hyles died in 2001, his son-in-law Jack Schaap, a 1979 graduate and former vice president of the school since 1996, became chancellor. That same year Hyles' boyhood home, a 384 square foot (36 square meter) shack in Italy, Texas was purchased to create a museum to honor Hyles and was shipped from Texas to Hyles–Anderson College. Schaap was removed as chancellor in 2012 after federal officials began looking into child abuse allegations, to which Schaap later pleaded guilty.\n\nIn 2012, \"Chicago Magazine\" reported that the school \"appears to be struggling\" with only 1,000 students enrolled, down from 2,700 in its peak. Schaap noted that donations dropped and staff lay-offs occurred before his arrest.\n\nIn 2015 Stuart Mason, the former President of Hyles–Anderson College, resigned to Pastor the Timberline Baptist Church in Sherwood, Oregon. The next President will be John Wilkerson.\n\nHyles–Anderson College is not accredited by any recognized accreditation body. An essay on Jack Hyles' website presents several arguments against accreditation. However, the U.S. armed services and public schools do not recognize unaccredited degrees, while several states restrict the use of degrees from unaccredited institutions.\n\nAll faculty, staff, and students are required to go soul-winning weekly, by participating in the evangelistic ministry of the First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana. The 2008 college catalog claimed that 10,000 new baptisms are performed each year at the Church.\n\nThere are separate requirements for male and female students for the same degree. For example, the Bachelor of Science Degree program has a \"Curriculum for Ladies\" that requires classes including \"Home Decorating,\" \"Clothing Design\" and \"Understanding Your Husband.\"\n\nFor school year 2010–2011, HAC's catalog listed policies that \"maybe you wouldn't like,\" including prohibiting male long hair, the use of alcohol, cigarettes, dance, Hollywood movies, playing cards, having \"fellowship with liberals,\" or participating in \"other questionable amusements\" as well as requiring \"young ladies\" to be chaperoned if they go off-campus.\n\nPastor Joseph Combs and his wife, Evangeline Lopez Combs were members of First Baptist Church of Hammond and Combs was also a professor at Hyles–Anderson College, even described as \"the foremost Bible instructor at Hyles Anderson\". In 1998, they were charged \"with kidnapping, aggravated assault, perjury and seven counts of rape\". The two adopted Esther Combs, who experts say was tortured by the couple for nearly 20 years. She had 410 scars covering her body, allegedly from curling iron burns, baseball bat beatings and other abuse that was undetected. One babysitter, who was a Hyles Anderson College student, testified that she and others \"suspected Esther was mistreated but didn't want to contradict Combs, who had been their Bible professor at Hyles Anderson College.\" Another babysitter testified she \"reported her suspicions to the college president, but apparently nothing was done\", she said. In 1986, Combs moved to Florida to start a church, but after accusations of abuse, they moved to Tennessee. They were convicted in 2000 of kidnapping, child abuse and aggravated assault. \nThey were sentenced to 179 years for the rape and torture of their daughter. The story was featured on national television with ABC television's \"PrimeTime\".\n\nIn 2012, school chancellor and graduate Jack Schaap was removed from his pastorate position at First Baptist Church of Hammond for having sex with a member of the church when she was 16. The girl, who has not been named, was taking classes at Hyles–Anderson College. As a result, Lake County law enforcement began a criminal investigation into the church and its Hyles–Anderson College. Schaap was charged in a U.S. District Court for taking a minor across state lines to have sex with her and signed a plea agreement. In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors alleged that Schaap \"groomed\" the girl, including kissing the victim during counseling and had sex with her in his office. In March 2013, Schaap was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for having sex with an underage girl.\n\nIn 1993 WJBK, a Detroit, Michigan news channel, produced a 30-minute documentary called \"Preying from the Pulpit\" that examined fresh claims of sex abuse in five different fundamentalist churches where church workers who molested children were traced back to Hyles–Anderson College. Besides the abuse, the program examined Hyles' teaching, including a 1990 sermon where \"Hyles pretended to pour poison into a glass and asked an associate pastor, Johnny Colsten, to drink from it. Colsten said he would.\" The report said, \"the sermon has the 'ring of Jonestown' to it—the mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 by followers of cult leader Jim Jones.\" Hyles called the program \"poor journalism\" and organized a national campaign to respond.\n\n\n"}

Though the precise locality is occasionally uncertain, the majority of the medieval synods assembled in the chapter-house of old St Pauls, or the former chapel of St Catherine within the precincts of Westminster Abbey or at Lambeth. The councils were of various types, each with a constitutional history of its own. Before the reign of Edward I, when convocation assumed substantially its present form, there were convened in London various diocesan, provincial, national and legatine synods; during the past six centuries, however, the chief ecclesiastical assemblies held there have been convocations of the province of Canterbury.\n\nThe first really notable council at St Pauls was that of 1075 under the presidency of Lanfranc; it renewed ancient regulations, forbade simony and permitted three bishops to remove from country places to Salisbury, Chichester and Chester respectively.\n\nIn 1102 a national synod at Westminster under Anselm of Canterbury adopted canons against simony, clerical marriages and slavery.\n\nThe councils of 1126, 1127 and 1138 were legatine, that of 1175 provincial; their canons, chiefly re-enactments, throw light on the condition of the clergy at that time. The canons of 1200 are based in large measure on recommendations of the Lateran Council of 1179.\n\nAt St Paul's the legatine constitutions of Otto were published at a synod of 1237, those of Ottoboni in 1268: these were the most important national councils held after the independence of York had been established. A synod at Lambeth in 1281 put forth canons none too welcome to Edward I; they included a detailed scheme for the religious instruction of the faithful. \n\nDuring the next two centuries the councils devoted much attention to heresy:\n\nThe 14th-century synods at St Paul's concerned themselves largely with the financial and moral status of the clergy, and made many regulations regarding their dress and behaviour (1328, 1342, 1343; cf. 1463).\n\nFrom the time of Edward VI on, many of the most vital changes in ecclesiastical discipline were adopted in convocations at St Pauls and in the Abbey. Among the most important were those of 1547, 1552, 1554, 1562, 1571, 1604, 1605, 1640 and 1661.\n\nIn 1852 there was held the first of a series of synods of the newly organized Catholic archdiocese of Westminster.

The crowned is usually a designated son of the deceased king, a child who was born only during his reign.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Mankon people fought against German colonial forces, in a conflict that became known as the Battle of Mankon. German colonial forces, allied with the Bali people, were led by Eugen Zintgraff and severely outnumbered the Mankon. The first two conflicts saw the German and Bali force, armed with guns and cannons, defeated at the hands of the spear- and machete-toting Mankon warriors. Some of Zintgraff's men had to flee on foot to as far as Babungo. But the Mankon people were finally defeated in a third conflict in 1901.\n\nThe Mankon community remained under German control until after World War I, when northwestern Cameroon became a British mandate territory. This situation remained until the British-administered Cameroons achieved independence in 1961.\n\nThe Mankon Cultural and Development Association is a cultural group that brings people of this kingdom together wherever they might be in the world to promote their culture and assists in development projects in the kingdom. The group has branches in major cities and towns in Cameroon and all over the world especially in the United States of America.

The purpose of legal observers is to monitor, record, and report on any unlawful or improper behaviour. Legal or human rights observers act as an independent third party within a conflictual civil protest context, observing police behaviour in order to keep police accountable for their actions. Legal observers can write incident reports describing police violence and misbehaviour and compile reports after the event. The use of video and still cameras, incident reports and audio recorders is common.\n\nIt is thought that the concept of using legal observers first emerged during protests in the 1930s in the East End of London, where police agents provocateur were used during protests by the British Union of Fascists (BUF). There were large counter-protests and it was alleged that the police sided with the BUF. Another case of legal observing was that carried out by the Black Panthers in the United States.\n\nLegal observers were used by Liberty (then known as the National Council for Civil Liberties) in Wapping, London, during the mid-1980s. The Wapping demonstration was in response to large protests by labour unions against the industrial relations policies of media magnate Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn the United States, the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) holds registered trademarks for the words \"legal observer\" alone, as well as the words \"legal observer\" on a green background. The National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer certification program was established in 1968 in New York City in response to protests at Columbia University and citywide antiwar and civil rights demonstrations. That same year, guild students organized for the defense of people swept up in mass arrests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The NLG Legal Observer certification program requires legal observers to take a training course and is part of a comprehensive system of legal support designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption or interference by the police and with the fewest possible consequences from the criminal justice system. Legal observers are trained and directed by National Lawyer Guild attorneys. The presence of legal observers may serve as a deterrent to unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement during a demonstration. \n\nNLG worked with the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux, the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to debut legal observers in Haiti during May Day protests of 2018.\n\nIn other countries, legal observers are associated with such groups as Liberty (UK), Green and Black Cross (UK), the G8 Legal Collective (Scotland), and others. In Australia in the 1970s, priests acted as legal observers during the large Moratorium Marches against the Vietnam War. In September 2000, Pt'chang Nonviolent Community Safety Group organised a large legal observer team for the S11 protest against the World Economic Forum in Melbourne. In Sydney, the Legal Observers Project, formally based at the Community Law Centre at the University of Technology, Sydney, and renamed Human Rights Monitors, was established in April 2001. This group reformed as Sydney Copwatch in 2009. Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International sometimes dispatch human rights observers who serve similar roles to legal observers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2326697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326697", "title": "Rotational molding", "text": "Rotational molding\n\nRotational Molding (BrE moulding) involves a heated hollow mold which is filled with a charge or shot weight of material. It is then slowly rotated (usually around two perpendicular axes), causing the softened material to disperse and stick to the walls of the mold. In order to maintain even thickness throughout the part, the mold continues to rotate at all times during the heating phase and to avoid sagging or deformation also during the cooling phase. The process was applied to plastics in the 1950s but in the early years was little used because it was a slow process restricted to a small number of plastics. Over time, improvements in process control and developments with plastic powders have resulted in a significant increase in usage.\n\nRotocasting (also known as rotacasting), by comparison, uses self-curing resins in an unheated mould, but shares slow rotational speeds in common with rotational molding. Spin casting should not be confused with using a high-speed centrifugal casting machine to shape self-curing resins or white metal.\n\nIn 1855, R. Peters of Britain documented the first use of biaxial rotation and heat. This rotational molding process was used to create metal artillery shells and other hollow vessels. The main purpose of using rotational molding was to create consistency in wall thickness and density. In 1905 in the United States F.A. Voelke used this method for the hollowing of wax objects. This led to G.S. Baker's and G.W. Perks's process of making hollow chocolate eggs in 1910. Rotational molding developed further and R.J. Powell used this process for molding plaster of Paris in the 1920s. These early methods using different materials directed the advancements in the way rotational molding is used today with plastics.\n\nPlastics were introduced to the rotational molding process in the early 1950s. One of the first applications was to manufacture doll heads. The machinery was made of an E Blue box-oven machine, inspired by a General Motors rear axle, powered by an external electric motor and heated by floor-mounted gas burners. The mold was made out of electroformed nickel-copper, and the plastic was a liquid PVC plastisol. The cooling method consisted of placing the mold into cold water. This process of rotational molding led to the creation of other plastic toys. As demand for and popularity of this process increased, it was used to create other products such as road cones, marine buoys, and car armrests. This popularity led to the development of larger machinery. A new system of heating was also created, going from the original direct gas jets to the current indirect high velocity air system. In Europe during the 1960s the Engel process was developed. This allowed large hollow containers to be manufactured in low-density polyethylene. The cooling method consisted of turning off the burners and allowing the plastic to harden while still rocking in the mold.\n\nIn 1976, the Association of Rotational Moulders (ARM) was started in Chicago as a worldwide trade association. The main objective of this association is to increase awareness of the rotational molding technology and process.\n\nIn the 1980s, new plastics, such as polycarbonate, polyester, and nylon, were introduced to rotational molding. This has led to new uses for this process, such as the creation of fuel tanks and industrial moldings. The research that has been done since the late 1980s at Queen's University Belfast has led to the development of more precise monitoring and control of the cooling processes based on their development of the “Rotolog system”.\n\nRotational molding machines are made in a wide range of sizes. They normally consist of molds, an oven, a cooling chamber, and mold spindles. The spindles are mounted on a rotating axis, which provides a uniform coating of the plastic inside each mold.\n\nMolds (or tooling) are either fabricated from welded sheet steel or cast. The fabrication method is often driven by part size and complexity; most intricate parts are likely made out of cast tooling. Molds are typically manufactured from stainless steel or aluminum. Aluminum molds are usually much thicker than an equivalent steel mold, as it is a softer metal. This thickness does not affect cycle times significantly since aluminum's thermal conductivity is many times greater than steel. Due to the need to develop a model prior to casting, cast molds tend to have additional costs associated with the manufacturing of the tooling, whereas fabricated steel or aluminum molds, particularly when used for less complex parts, are less expensive. However, some molds contain both aluminum and steel. This allows for variable thicknesses in the walls of the product. While this process is not as precise as injection molding, it does provide the designer with more options. The aluminum addition to the steel provides more heat capacity, causing the melt-flow to stay in a fluid state for a longer period.\n\nNormally all rotation molding systems have a number of parts including molds, oven, cooling chamber and mold spindles. The molds are used to create the part, and are typically made of aluminium. The quality and finish of the product is directly related to the quality of the mold being used. The oven is used to heat the part while also rotating the part to form the part desired. The cooling chamber is where the part is placed until it cools, and the spindles are mounted to rotate and provide a uniform coat of plastic inside each mold.\n\nThis is a specialized machine designed mainly to produce long narrow parts. Some are of the clamshell type, thus one arm, but there are also shuttle-type Rock & Roll machines, with two arms. Each arm rotates or rolls the mold 360 degrees in one direction and at the same time tips and rocks the mold 45 degrees above or below horizontal in the other direction. Newer machines use forced hot air to heat the mold. These machines are best for large parts that have a large length-to-width ratio. Because of the smaller heating chambers, there is a saving in heating costs compared to bi-axial machines.\n\nThis is a single arm rotational molding machine. The arm is usually supported by other arms on both ends. The clamshell machine heats and cools the mold in the same chamber. It takes up less space than equivalent shuttle and swing arm rotational molders. It is low in cost compared to the size of products made. It is available in smaller scales for schools interested in prototyping and for high quality models. More than one mold can be attached to the single arm.\n\nThe loading and unloading area is at the front of the machine between the heating and cooling areas. These machines vary in size between small to medium compared to other rotational machines. Vertical rotational molding machines are energy efficient due to their compact heating and cooling chambers. These machines have the same (or similar) capabilities as the horizontal carousel multi-arm machines, but take up much less space.\n\nMost shuttle machines have two arms that move the molds back and forth between the heating chamber and cooling station. The arms are independent of each other and they turn the molds bi-axially. In some cases, the shuttle machine has only one arm. This machine moves the mold in a linear direction in and out of heating and cooling chambers. It is low in cost for the size of product produced and the footprint is kept to a minimum compared to other types of machines. It is also available in smaller scale for schools and prototyping.\n\nThe swing-arm machine can have up to four arms, with a bi-axial movement. Each arm is independent from each other as it is not necessary to operate all arms at the same time. Each arm is mounted on a corner of the oven and it swings in and out of the oven. On some swing-arm machines, a pair of arms is mounted on the same corner, thus a four-arm machine has two pivot points. These machines are very useful for companies that have long cooling cycles or require a lot of time to demold parts, compared to the cook time. It is a lot easier to schedule maintenance work or try to run a new mold without interrupting production on the other arms of the machine.\n\nThis is one of the most common bi-axial machines in the industry. It can have up to 4 arms and six stations and it comes in a wide range of sizes. The machine comes in two different models, fixed and independent. A fixed-arm carousel consists of 3 fixed arms that must move together. One arm will be in the heating chamber while the other is in the cooling chamber and the other in the loading/reloading area. The fixed-arm carousel works well when working with identical cycle times on each arm. The independent-arm carousel machine is available with 3 or 4 arms that can move separately from the other. This allows for different size molds, with different cycle times and thickness needs.\n\nThe rotational molding process is a high-temperature, low-pressure plastic-forming process that uses heat and biaxial rotation (i.e., angular rotation on two axes) to produce hollow, one-piece parts.\nCritics of the process point to its long cycle times—only one or two cycles an hour can typically occur, as opposed to other processes such as injection molding, where parts can be made in a few seconds. The process does have distinct advantages. Manufacturing large, hollow parts such as oil tanks is much easier by rotational molding than any other method. Rotational molds are significantly cheaper than other types of mold. Very little material is wasted using this process, and excess material can often be re-used, making it a very economically and environmentally viable manufacturing process.\n\nThe rotational molding process consists of four distinct phases:\n\n\nUntil recently, the process largely relied on both trial and error and the experience of the operator to determine when the part should be removed from the oven and when it was cool enough to be removed from the mold. Technology has improved in recent years, allowing the air temperature in the mold to be monitored, removing much of the guesswork from the process.\n\nMuch of the current research is into reducing the cycle time, as well as improving part quality. The most promising area is in mold pressurization. It is well known that applying a small amount of pressure internally to the mold at the correct point in the heating phase accelerates coalescence of the polymer particles during the melting, producing a part with fewer bubbles in less time than at atmospheric pressure. This pressure delays the separation of the part from the mold wall due to shrinkage during the cooling phase, aiding cooling of the part. The main drawback to this is the danger to the operator of explosion of a pressurized part. This has prevented adoption of mold pressurization on a large scale by rotomolding manufacturers.\n\nA good mold release agent (MRA) will allow the material to be removed quickly and effectively. Mold releases can reduce cycle times, defects, and browning of finished product. There are a number of mold release types available; they can be categorized as follows:\n\nMore than 80% of all the material used is from the polyethylene family: cross-linked polyethylene (PEX), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and regrind. Other compounds are PVC plastisols, nylons, and polypropylene.\n\nOrder of materials most commonly used by industry:\n\n\nThese materials are also occasionally used (not in order of most used):\n\n\nRecently it has become possible to use natural materials in the molding process. Through the use of real sands and stone chip, sandstone composite can be created which is 80% natural non-processed material.\n\nRotational molding of plaster is used to produce hollow statuettes.\n\nChocolate is rotationally molded to form hollow treats.\n\nDesigners can select the best material for their application, including materials that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. Additives for weather resistance, flame retardation, or static elimination can be incorporated.\nInserts, graphics, threads, handles, minor undercuts, flat surfaces without draft angles, or fine surface detail can be part of the design. Designs can also be multi-wall, either hollow or foam filled.\n\nProducts that can be manufactured using rotational molding include storage tanks, furniture, road signs and bollards, planters, pet houses, toys, bins and refuse containers, doll parts, road cones, footballs, helmets, canoes, rowing boats, tornado shelters, kayak hulls, underground cellars for vine and vegetables storage and playground slides. The process is also used to make highly specialised products, including UN-approved containers for the transportation of nuclear fissile materials, anti-piracy ship protectors, seals for inflatable oxygen masks and lightweight components for the aerospace industry.\n\nAnother consideration is in the draft angles. These are required to remove the piece from the mold. On the outside walls, a draft angle of 1° may work (assuming no rough surface or holes). On inside walls, such as the inside of a boat hull, a draft angle of 5° may be required. This is due to shrinkage and possible part warping.\n\nAnother consideration is of structural support ribs. While solid ribs may be desirable and achievable in injection molding and other processes, a hollow rib is the best solution in rotational molding. A solid rib may be achieved through inserting a finished piece in the mold but this adds cost.\n\nRotational molding excels at producing hollow parts. However, care must be taken when this is done. When the depth of the recess is greater than the width there may be problems with even heating and cooling. Additionally, enough room must be left between the parallel walls to allow for the melt-flow to move properly throughout the mold. Otherwise webbing may occur. A desirable parallel wall scenario would have a gap at least three times the nominal wall thickness, with five times the nominal wall thickness being optimal. Sharp corners for parallel walls must also be considered. With angles of less than 45° bridging, webbing, and voids may occur.\n\nAnother consideration is the melt-flow of materials. Certain materials, such as nylon, will require larger radii than other materials. Additionally, the stiffness of the set material may be a factor. More structural and strengthening measures may be required when a flimsy material is used.\n\nOne benefit of rotational molding is the ability to experiment, particularly with wall thicknesses. Cost is entirely dependent on wall thickness, with thicker walls being costlier and more time consuming to produce. While the wall can have nearly any thickness, designers must remember that the thicker the wall, the more material and time will be required, increasing costs. In some cases, the plastics may significantly degrade due to extended periods at high temperature. Also, different materials have different thermal conductivity, meaning they require different times in the heating chamber and cooling chamber. Ideally, the part will be tested to use the minimum thickness required for the application. This minimum will then be established as a nominal thickness.\n\nFor the designer, while variable thicknesses are possible, a process called stop rotation is required. This process is limited in that only one side of the mold may be thicker than the others. After the mold is rotated and all the surfaces are sufficiently coated with the melt-flow, the rotation stops and the melt-flow is allowed to pool at the bottom of the mold cavity.\n\nWall thickness is important for corner radii as well. Large outside radii are preferable to small radii. Large inside radii are also preferable to small inside radii. This allows for a more even flow of material and a more even wall thickness. However, an outside corner is generally stronger than an inside corner.\n\nRotational molding offers design advantages over other molding processes. With proper design, parts assembled from several pieces can be molded as one part, eliminating high fabrication costs.\nThe process also has inherent design strengths, such as consistent wall thickness and strong outside corners that are virtually stress free. For additional strength, reinforcing ribs can be designed into the part. Along with being designed into the part, they can be added to the mold.\n\nThe ability to add prefinished pieces to the mold alone is a large advantage. Metal threads, internal pipes and structures, and even different colored plastics can all be added to the mold prior to the addition of plastic pellets. However, care must be taken to ensure that minimal shrinkage while cooling will not damage the part. This shrinking allows for mild undercuts and negates the need for ejection mechanisms (in most pieces).\n\nIn some cases rotational molding can be used as a feasible alternative to blow molding, this is due to the similarity in product outputs, with products such as plastic bottles and cylindrical containers, this is only effective on a smaller scale as it much more costly to blow mold regarding a small output, and with fewer resulting products rotational molding is much cheaper, due to blow molding relying on economies of scale regarding efficiency.\n\nAnother advantage lies in the molds themselves. Since they require less tooling, they can be manufactured and put into production much more quickly than other molding processes. This is especially true for complex parts, which may require large amounts of tooling for other molding processes. Rotational molding is also the process of choice for short runs and rush deliveries. The molds can be swapped quickly or different colors can be used without purging the mold. With other processes, purging may be required to swap colors.\n\nDue to the uniform thicknesses achieved, large stretched sections are nonexistent, which makes large thin panels possible (although warping may occur). Also, there is little flow of plastic (stretching) but rather a placing of the material within the part. These thin walls also limit cost and production time.\n\nAnother cost advantage with rotational molding is the minimal amount of material wasted in production. There are no sprues or runners (as in injection molding), no off-cuts , or pinch off scrap (blow molding). What material is wasted, through scrap or failed part testing, can usually be recycled.\n\nRotationally molded parts have to follow some restrictions that are different from other plastic processes. As it is a low pressure process, sometimes designers face hard to reach areas in the mold. Good quality powder may help overcome some situations, but usually the designers have to keep in mind that it is not possible to make sharp threads that would be possible with injection molding. Some products based on polyethylene can be put in the mold before filling it with the main material. This can help to avoid holes that otherwise would appear in some areas. This could also be achieved using molds with movable sections.\n\nAnother limitation lies in the molds themselves. Unlike other processes where only the product needs to be cooled before being removed, with rotational molding the entire mold must be cooled. While water cooling processes are possible, there is still a significant down time of the mold. Additionally, this increases both financial and environmental costs. Some plastics will degrade with the long heating cycles or in the process of turning them into a powder to be melted.\n\nThe stages of heating and cooling involve transfer of heat first from the hot medium to the polymer material and next from it to the cooling environment. In both cases, the process of heat transfer occurs in an unsteady regime; therefore, its kinetics attracts the greatest interest in considering these steps. In the heating stage, the heat taken from the hot gas is absorbed both by the mold and the polymer material. The rig for rotational molding usually has a relatively small wall thickness and is manufactured from metals with a high thermal conductivity (aluminum, steel). As a rule, the mold transfers much more heat than plastic can absorb; therefore, the mold temperature must vary linearly. The rotational velocity in rotational molding is rather low (4 to 20 rpm). As a result, in the first stages of the heating cycle, the charged material remains as a powder layer at the bottom of the mold. The most convenient way of changing the cycle is by applying PU sheets in hot rolled forms.\n\nDue to the nature of the process, materials selection must take into account the following:\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from the late-1990s to early-2000s.\n\nLeRoux grew up in Oxford, Alabama. He attended Oxford High School, where he was a junior high state finalist in amateur wrestling in two successive years. In his junior year he came third in the varsity state tournament. LeRoux also played football for the Oxford High Yellow Jackets, and in 1993 his team won the Alabama State Football Championship. After graduating from high school, LeRoux attended Jacksonville State University, studying towards a pre-med degree. He later decided to take a year out in order to focus on his burgeoning career as a cartoonist.\n\nIn 1997 LeRoux saw an advertisement for the WCW Power Plant (the professional wrestling school owned and operated by World Championship Wrestling) on an episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\". LeRoux qualified to train in the Power Plant, meeting the arduous physical qualifications, and trained throughout 1998, with his first match being a loss to Perry Saturn in mid-1998. He was promoted to the main roster in July 1998, and wrestled on \"WCW Saturday Night\", \"WCW WorldWide\" and \"WCW Thunder\" as \"Mark LeRoux\" for several months, often losing squash matches.\n\nLeRoux debuted on \"Nitro\" on February 2, 1999 as \"Lash LeRoux\", a take off of Cajun western movie star Lash LaRue, losing to then-Cruiserweight Champion Billy Kidman. It was this match that caught the eyes of WCW officials, and he was signed to an official contract with World Championship Wrestling. LeRoux's character spoke with a broad Cajun accent.\n\nLeRoux competed primarily in the cruiserweight division. He feuded with Disco Inferno over the Cruiserweight Championship, and lost to Disco in a title match at Halloween Havoc 1999. Shortly afterwards, LeRoux and Disco joined forces against the New York gangster Tony Marinara and his henchmen, The Mamalukes, who were owed money by the compulsive gambler Disco. They faced Big Vito and Johnny The Bull in a tag team match at Starrcade 1999, but lost following a miscommunication between the partners. After the match, the unconscious Disco Inferno was carried from the arena inside a body bag and locked in the trunk of a car.\n\nHe appeared sporadically on television, teaming with Midnight and pursuing the Cruiserweight Championship once more. He was fired in storyline by WCW President Eric Bischoff in April 2000 for not helping to protect him from Diamond Dallas Page, whose wife Kimberly had betrayed him in order to align herself with Bischoff.\n\nLeRoux and several other wrestlers who had been fired by the disgruntled President returned several weeks later as the Misfits In Action (M.I.A.), a military-themed stable who were unwilling to align themselves with either the heel New Blood or the face Millionaire's Club. All of the Misfits were given ranks, with LeRoux known as \"Corporal Cajun\".\n\nThe M.I.A. feuded with the New Blood, with LeRoux helping Lieutenant Loco retain his Cruiserweight Championship. LeRoux and Loco won the WCW World Tag Team Championship on October 9, 2000 in Sydney, Australia, defeating New Blood members Mark Jindrak and Sean O'Haire, but lost the belts just minutes later in an instant rematch ordered by commissioner Mike Sanders (also a New Blood member). The M.I.A. also feuded with Team Canada, who had taken possession of the United States Heavyweight Championship and renamed it the \"Canadian Heavyweight Championship\", during which time M.I.A.'s valet, Major Gunns turned on them and joined Team Canada.\n\nThe M.I.A. gradually disbanded in late 2000 and early 2001, with the departure of Loco and Sergeant A.W.O.L. precipitating the end of the stable. On January 23, 2001 the leader of the M.I.A., General Rection, requested LeRoux's M.I.A. shirt, informing him that he had been \"honorably discharged\". LeRoux began wrestling as Lash LeRoux once more, and returned to the cruiserweight division. His last appearance on WCW television was on the February 19 episode of \"Nitro\", where he challenged United States Champion Rick Steiner and was easily defeated.\n\nFollowing the purchase of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001, LeRoux was signed to a three-year developmental contract by the WWF in April 2001. Along with several other former WCW wrestlers, he was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association to further his training. LeRoux negotiated his release in June 2002, preferring \"to pursue other options rather than be stuck in limbo.\"\n\nLeRoux appeared on the inaugural Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view on June 19, 2002, competing in the Gauntlet for the Gold where he was eliminated by Jeff Jarrett. The following week, LeRoux suffered a neck injury while working on the independent circuit, and was initially told that he needed surgery. He consulted a second doctor, however, and underwent seven months of physical rehabilitation without surgery until his neck healed. From April to July 2004, LeRoux travelled south to Orlando, Florida and appeared occasionally on TNA's secondary television show \"Xplosion\".\n\nLeRoux also competed for a number of independent promotions, including Georgia Championship Wrestling and NWA Wrestle Birmingham and made a number of appearances in Deep South Wrestling.\n\nLeRoux has also worked as a cartoonist, and his work has been featured in multiple publications and websites including \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" and \"The Wrestler\". During his tenure in WCW, he drew a series of single-panel comics for \"WCW Magazine\" called \"Lashing Out\".\n\nAfter retiring from professional wrestling, LeRoux became a pastor.\n\nLeRoux has two brothers, older brother Joseph and younger brother James, and younger twin sisters, Terri and Sherri Creswell. LeRoux married his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth, on December 22, 1997.\n\nLeRoux is close friends with fellow WCW alumni and Misfits In Action stablemates Bill DeMott and Chavo Guerrero, Jr., and Jerry Tuite (until Tuite's death). Growing up, LeRoux was a fan of Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Bob Armstrong, Arn Anderson, and the Four Horsemen.\n\nLeRoux is Christian.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also the Chief Executive of the World Netball Company, and was Chairman of the organising committee for the 2007 World Netball Championships, but announced his resignation on 24 January 2006, citing a possible conflict of interest, as his company would be working as a ground operator during the championships.\n\nBeddoes won the West Central General Electors Communal constituency, one of three reserved for ethnic minorities, for the United General Party in the 2001 parliamentary election. Despite being the sole parliamentary representative of his party, he served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2004, because Mahendra Chaudhry, leader of the Fiji Labour Party (the main opposition party) refused the position, demanding inclusion in the Cabinet instead. Beddoes relinquished the role of Opposition Leader late in 2004, when Chaudhry finally gave up his quest for a Cabinet role and agreed to assume the leadership of the Opposition.\n\nBeddoes's first stint as Opposition Leader gave him and his tiny party a national platform. In mid-2003, Beddoes responded to rising interest among indigenous and Indo- Fijians by announcing that membership of his party, which had been confined to minority groups like Europeans, Chinese, and Banaban Islanders, would now be open to all races, and that the party would contest all 71 seats in the House of Representatives in the next parliamentary election, scheduled for 2006.\n\nBeddoes criticised the ethnic faultlines that characterise Fijian politics; communal voting was a factor in this, he said on 28 August 2005, but could be mitigated if only voters would judge a candidate according to his or her personal merits, rather than on the basis of whether the candidate's political party was indigenous-led or Indo-Fijian-led. He also called for changes to the electoral system, under which almost two-thirds of the House of Representatives are elected from communal constituencies, whose electors are registered members of a particular ethnic group.\n\nBeddoes retained his constituency, with a slightly reduced majority, in the parliamentary election held on 6–13 May 2006, and was appointed Leader of the Opposition for the second time on 3 June His second appointment came after weeks of disputes with his erstwhile ally, Mahendra Chaudhry, who had insisted that the position should be his, despite the decision of the Labour Party to enter a grand coalition with the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party (SDL). After obtaining legal advice, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo appointed Beddoes.\n\nAs of 19 September, Beddoes was still performing his duties only on a part-time basis, Fiji Television reported. To assume the position full-time, he would be constitutionally required to divest himself of his private business interests.\n\nThroughout much of 2005, Beddoes was at the forefront of a public campaign against the government's controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which provided for the establishment of a Commission empowered to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup d'état which deposed the People's Coalition government in May 2000. Beddoes travelled throughout Fiji, speaking against the bill, which was, he claimed, nothing other than a legal mechanism for releasing from prison persons convicted of involvement in the coup, who were supporters of or in some way linked to the present government. The bill was temporarily shelved during the election and its aftermath. An amended version was pending, but the military coup of 5 December 2006 put an end to it.\n\nLong considered an ally of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces in their long-running dispute with the Qarase government, Beddoes began criticising the Military towards the end of 2006, as tensions escalated to unprecedented levels. On 20 October, Fiji Television quoted him as calling for an end to the Military's attempts to intimidate the government. On the other hand, he called on the government on 28 November to placate the Military by dropping investigations into insubordination on the part of the Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama. \"\"All it is doing is putting a red rag in front of a bull and the bull has 4,000 guns,\"\" he told Australia's ABC Radio. On 1 December, as it became apparent that a coup was imminent, he branded the Military a bunch of bullies, and issued a strong warning to persons who might be considering accepting office in an interim government, saying that they would be taken to task when the storm had passed. On 4 December, Beddoes called on Fijians to rally in support of the rule of law.\n\nBeddoes condemned the coup of 5 December, and spoke out strongly against what he saw as violations of constitutional and human rights.\n\nBeddoes welcomed the decision of the Military to restore Ratu Josefa Iloilo to the Presidency on 4 January 2007, but condemned the appointment of Bainimarama as interim Prime Minister on 5 January and criticised the President's endorsement of the coup, the Fiji Times reported. He expressed disappointment when his deputy, Bernadette Rounds-Ganilau, accepted office in Bainimarama's interim government, and asked her to resign from the UPP. He was particularly disappointed, he said, that Ganilau's decision came less than twenty-four hours after he had been visited by soldiers conveying a message from Land Force Commander Pita Driti threatening him to stop speaking against the Military. On 10 January, he accused the Fiji Labour Party, some of whose leading figures, were included in the interim government, of having been privy to the coup plot.\n\nOn 27 August 2005, Beddoes spoke out against calls by some for the closure of loopholes in the Penal Code which had allowed the release of two men, one a Fijian citizen and the other a foreigner, who had been sentenced to a prison term on 5 April for homosexual acts. This sentence was overturned on 26 August by Justice Gerald Winter, who said that the Penal Code was not applicable to what adults did in private.\n\nThe same day, Beddoes condemned Senator Mitieli Bulanauca for speaking against homosexuality and attacking Justice Winter in the Senate. \"\"Senator Bulanauca is among a very small percentage of misfits and clowns who live off the lies they try to spin to try and intimidate others, while sheltering behind parliamentary privilege,\"\" Beddoes said. \"\"These expressions of hate come from a man who claims he is a Christian and quotes endlessly from the Bible.\"\"\n\nOn 20 January 2007, Beddoes announced that he would retire from the presidency of the UPP at the Annual General Meeting of his party, on 31 March.\n\nAfter the winding up of the UPP in January 2013, Beddoes announced that he would join the new Social Democratic Liberal Party.\n\n"}
{"id": "2326755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326755", "title": "Quilmes Atlético Club", "text": "Quilmes Atlético Club\n\nQuilmes Atlético Club () is an Argentine sports club based in the Quilmes district of Greater Buenos Aires. Quilmes is the oldest club of Argentina still competing in official tournaments, having been founded in 1887. Its football squad currently plays in the Primera B Nacional, the second division of the Argentinian football.\n\nApart from football, Quilmes' main sport is field hockey, which both teams, women's and men's, have won many titles at Torneo Metropolitano championships. Quilmes has also a field hockey stadium, \"Estadio Nacional\" with a capacity of 6,000 seats.\n\nOther sports practised at the club are basketball, gymnastics, handball, martial arts, roller skating, swimming and tennis.\n\nThe origins of the club can be found at the \"Quilmes and Polo Club\", an institution founded by British immigrants about 1880. In 1887 the club changed its name to \"Quilmes Rovers Athletic Club\" with a football team formed entirely by British people. That team took part in the second edition of Argentine Primera División championship held in 1893.\n\nOn 5 November 1897, promoting an initiative by priest J.T. Stevenson, the \"Quilmes Cricket Club\" is founded. The club changed its name to \"Quilmes Athletic Club\" in 1901, the year that Quilmes registered to Argentine Association Football League (former Argentine Football Association).\n\nBy the time that Quilmes was founded, the only club existing in Quilmes was the Quilmes Lawn Tennis Club. Guillermo Morgan was named president, becoming the first chairman of the recently created institution. During its first years, Quilmes did not admitted non-British members. The club represented to the huge British community that worked at Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway. At the beginning of its existence, the main sport practised at Quilmes was cricket, and club's colors were crimson and blue.\n\nIn March 1898 Quilmes Cricket Club added football as sport. In 1901 the club also changed its colors, adopting the England national football team's, white shirt with blue collar and shorts. By the first years of 20th century the club began to admit Argentine members, following the example of the other institution of the city, Argentino de Quilmes, which had been founded as a reaction to British rules for memberships. Unlike Quilmes CC, Argentino was opened to receive Argentine members.\n\nQuilmes was the first team (amongst the one that are still active) to face legendary Alumni, in 1901. Alumni beat Quilmes 1–0 and 3–1, keeping its supremacy until 1906 when Quilmes achieved its first victory, defeating Alumni 4–2.\n\nIn 1912 Quilmes won its first title, the Primera División championship. The team was formed by many British players that had played for Alumni, dissolved one year before. The team remained in the top division of football until 1937, when it was relegated along with Argentinos Juniors to the second division.\n\nThe team played in Primera B until 1949 when Quilmes won the title promoting to Primera. Quilmes finished the season scored the most goals during the tournament (118). In 1959 the club changed its name again, turning to the Spanish denomination Quilmes Atlético Club which has remained since.\nAfter being relegated again in 1951, Quilmes won the second division championship and promoted to Primera, after the Football Association stated that Newell's Old Boys (who had finished first and proclaimed champion) promised Excursionistas an amount of money if they defeated Quilmes. As a result, the title was given to Quilmes (which had finished 2nd after Newell's) which promoted to Primera instead of \"Rosarino\" team.\n\nQuilmes lasted only season at the top division, being relegated in 1962 and returning to Primera 3 years later, along with champion Colón de Santa Fe. The club would be relegated again in 1970. Five years later, Quilmes won the Primera B title, promoting along with champion San Telmo.\n\nIn 1978 Quilmes won the Torneo Metropolitano, being its only title in Primera to date. That team, coached by José Yudica, had notable players such as Jorge Gáspari, Horacio Milozzi, top-scorer Luis Andreuchi and Omar \"El Indio\" Gómez, considered the greatest idol in club's history. The next year Quilmes played the 1979 Copa Libertadores but the team did not qualify for the second round being eliminated.\n\nIn 1980 Quilmes was relegated to Primera B, returning to Primera just one year later along with champion Nueva Chicago after finishing 2nd. Quilmes made a great performance during the 1981 Nacional reaching the finals where the team was finally beaten by Ferro Carril Oeste. The next season Quilmes could not repeat the good performance and was relegated again to second division. In 1986, due to a major restructuring in the Argentine league system, a new division, \"Primera B Nacional\" was created. Quilmes did not qualify to play there so the team continued at Primera B, which became the third division after the restructuring.\n\nIn 1987 Quilmes won the 1986–87 Primera B Metropolitana title, promoting to National B. That same year construction of the new stadium started. In 1991 Quilmes returned to Primera División after 10 years playing at lower divisions, when beat Club Almirante Brown 1–0. The squad only lasted one season in Primera, returning to Nacional B.\n\nIn 1995 Quilmes inaugurated its new stadium, named \"Estadio Centenario Dr. José Luis Meiszner\" playing a friendly match against Club Nacional de Football. During the following seasons, Quilmes would have many chances to promote but the team did not achieve its objective, losing the final playoffs at the hands of Huracán, Los Andes, and Banfield. Moreover, Quilmes lost another two chances for promotion when being defeated by Belgrano de Córdoba both times.\n\nQuilmes finally got the long-awaited promotion to Primera in 2002–03 season, after leaving behind Argentinos Juniors with scores of 1–0 and 0–0.\n\nAfter two good campaigns in primera, Quilmes qualified to play the 2005 Copa Libertadores. The team passed the first stage although it was soon eliminated. Quilmes would be later relegated to Nacional B in 2006–07 season, but the squad returned to the top division in 2009–10 season along with Olimpo and All Boys. Just one year later Quilmes was again relegated to the second division, where the team remained until 2012.\n\nIn June 2012 Quilmes returned to Primera División, after being placed 2nd in Primera B Nacional. The \"Cervecero\" defeated Guillermo Brown de Puerto Madryn 2–0 in the last fixture totalizing 72 points, therefore promoting after champion River Plate.\n\nChristian Sterli became Quilmes' new president on 25 August 2019, replacing Marcelo Calello.\n\nThe club settled on 5 November 1887 as the date of its foundation, considering Quilmes and Polo Club (then Quilmes Rovers AC) as its predecessor. Nevertheless, Argentine football historian Jorge Gallego stated the original institution founded in 1887 was dissolved and the Quilmes Cricket Club was in fact a completely new institution, not related with other clubs previously founded in the city of Quilmes. \n\nThe football jersey was primarily red with blue collar and borders, until 1901 when the club adopted the white with navy collar that has remained to date.<br>\nMen's and women's field hockey teams respect the traditional white and navy but they use a horizontal stripes version.\n\nQuilmes most known nickname is \"El Cervecero\" (The Brewers) because of the Cerveza Quilmes brewery of the same city (which also is the main sponsor of the club).\n\nQuilmes started building a new stadium in 1987 to inaugurate it first in 1993, and then officially in 1995. It was extended in 1998 to its current capacity.\nThe old stadium of Guido and Sarmiento junction was later demolished.\n\nJuan Botasso\n\n\n\n"}

Most of the cultural events take place in the heart of Parque Metropolitano Simón Bolívar The festivities also include pre-carnival celebrations during the month of July. One of the main objectives of the carnival is to promote and encourage the cultural and musical diversity of Colombia.\n\nMany activities take place during the celebrations of the carnival\n\nAccording to historian Marcos Gonzales, Bogotá was one of the first cities in the continent in celebrating its own carnival and that in 1539, just one year after the Hispanic foundation of the city the Spanish Crown decreed the celebrations will be carried out in Lent with the name of \"Carnestolendas of Santafé de Bogotá\". In 1561 the Indian chief of Ubaque was allowed to participate celebrating the parties of his own culture (Muisca) which were part of the celebrations until the 19th century.\n\nThe celebration of the modern carnival in Bogotá dates back to 1916, when the first queen of Bogotá's student carnival, Elvira Zea, was crowned in a congeniality contest. After winning the contest she used her real name as Queen's name, in that occasion she took the name Elvira I. The queen was the person in charge of opening the celebrations. In the following years the carnival grew in number of comparsas and beauty queens. In the 1930s the national government and the mayorship of Bogotá suspended the carnival due to disorders caused by alcohol. An attempt to revive the carnival in 1960 failed for reasons of alcohol abuse and violence.\n\nThe Carnival was resurrected by Bogotá's Mayor in a Government Resolution on April 14, 2005. The objective of the new Carnival was to promote a collective atmosphere of fellowship and to celebrate life, creative expression, and enjoyment. It further seeks to generate a feeling of belonging to the city, to enforce processes of reconciliation and fair play, and the inclusion and recognition of all districts and cultures of the Capital City of Colombia.\n\n\n\n"}

The nun will make her profession of solemn vows during a Mass. During the course of the Mass, she will lie prostrate as the community and all in the Church pray over her, present her vows, signed upon the altar, to the bishop and profess her vows to the Abbess or Prioress of the monastery. After the vows have been professed her white veil will be swapped for a black veil. As a sign of her espousal commitment to Christ, she will be presented with a ring which she will wear for the rest of her life and subsequently be buried in. It is also common that she will receive a wreath of flowers. In some monasteries, according to traditional practise, the nun making her solemn profession will also receive the Rite of Consecration of Virgins, although this may also be omitted or delayed to another time. \n\nDuring Mass the nun will wear the habit she has worn since her clothing. The clothing of a novice nun is a ceremony which may be public (in a church, although the actual change of clothes will take place in a sideroom) or private (in the monastery's chapter or choir, according to tradition). It will include the clothing in the monastic habit and often also the tonsuring of the postulant's hair. \n\nIn some congregations and religious orders the woman who is taking the habit will present herself in a wedding dress and veil. It is the Clarissian tradition and Poor Clares, according to the wishes of St. Clare, will almost always do it, while orders who follow different rules may choose to have the postulant receiving the habit wear a dress of her own choosing or simply the uniform she has worn as a postulant. The clothing may be public, in a church and attended by family and friends, or private, in the monastic Chapter House or private choir. \n\nSome orders and congregations, like the Poor Clare Colettines will exchange the white veil for a black veil upon the profession of First Vows, while the Handmaids of the Precious Blood wear white veils at all stages of their formation. Amongst the apostolic orders of sisters veils of all colours may be worn according to the regulations of the particular order. \n\nIn Lay circles, a triangle- or rectangle-shaped cloth or lace veil, also known as a mantilla, is worn by Catholic women while attending church Mass. This practice has fallen into decline since the 1960s among those who attend the revised rite of the Mass, but traditional Catholic women who attend the ancient Latin Mass still wear them. Traditionally, married women have worn black veils, while unmarried women wore white veils and some still follow this tradition today. \n\n"}

It is bordered to the east of Saulsville, to the west of Proclamation Hill; to the north of Laudium and to the south of Lotus Gardens. The settlement was established in 1939, and is named after Mrs MP Atteridge, chairwoman of the Committee for Non-European Affairs on the Pretoria City Council at the time. The Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium is located in Atteridgeville.\n\nAtteridgeville was established by the government in 1939 as a settlement for black people by the government, after much lobbying by Mrs Myrtle Patricia Atteridge, the chairwoman of the Committee for Non-European Affairs on the City Council at that time. Atteridgeville was established nine years prior to the voting in of the apartheid government in 1948. The first occupants were moved to Atteridgeville from Marabastad on 26 May 1940. It was officially opened on 5 August 1940. Mrs Atteridge, who was also a philanthropist, Black Sash activist and the deputy mayoress of Pretoria, endeavoured to improve living conditions of black people who were previously living in squalid conditions in Marabastad. Atteridgeville provided amenities such as brick housing, lighting and toilets, and later, so as to further enhance living standards, the township was connected by train to Pretoria CBD. Schools, creches and clinics were established thereafter. The naming of the township was in fact suggested by the black people themselves who also requested Mrs Atteridge to represent them in parliament which she refused as she was disinclined to participate in an exclusionary regime. Between 1940 and 1949 more than 1500 houses were built for people relocated from Marabastad, Bantule and other areas around Pretoria.\n\nDevelopment was frozen between 1968 and 1978 in accordance with the government's policy that housing provided for black people be limited to the homelands. In 1984, Atteridgeville was granted municipal status.\n\n1984 saw school boycotts and general unrest when demands by the Congress of South African Students to implement democratic Students' Representative Councils in schools were rejected by the Department of Education and Training. The first victim of the school boycotts was Emma Sathekge from David Helen Peta High School. The schools were suspended for the better part of 1984 and exams were not written by all High school learners.\n\nOn 15 April 1988 a bomb explosion caused damage to the Atteridgeville Municipal buildings; no-one was injured during the attack. The attack was planned by Umkhonto we Sizwe and executed by one of their members, Johannes Maleka. In November 2000, Johannes Maleka was granted amnesty for his part in the attack by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Atteridgeville is the only township in Gauteng that blocked Zulu-land migrants from forcefully occupying Hostels, prominent members of the ANC in the township including Dr Abe Nkomo, Mr Rami Dau, Reeves Mabitsi and Kgomotso Mokoka held the forefront.\n\nAtteridgeville is a diverse township, the residents of which speak many languages. According to the 2011 census, the most commonly spoken language is Northern Sotho, followed by Tswana and Sesotho. A mixture of languages such as Afrikaans, Setswana, English and Sesotho are sometimes fused together to form what is now a unique language style of the township with a slight inclination to slang known as Tsotsitaal or siPitori.\n\nThe Mendi Memorial is a war memorial dedicated to over 600 black South African soldiers who died when the British SS Mendi sank after a tragic collision in 1917, during the First World War. The memorial was unveiled on 24 March 1996. The memorial consist of the upper half of a soldier holding onto a ships railing with the other hand extended towards the sky. \n\nThe memorial is located at the \"'Ga-mothakga Resort\" 'on the corner of Pitse and Tlou Streets.\n\n\n"}

The GTV is a 2+2 coupé, and the Spider is a two-seater roadster version of the GTV. Around 39,000 Spiders and 41,700 GTVs were built.\n\nThe GTV's name (Gran Turismo Veloce—) placed it as the successor to the long-discontinued Alfetta GTV coupé, whereas the Spider was effectively the replacement for the then 30-year-old 105-series Giulia Spider. The GTV was available until the launch of the Brera in 2005, while the Spider lasted another year until the launch of its Brera-based successor in 2006.\n\nAlfa Romeo GTV is claimed as the best sport car by Jeremy Clarkson in 1998 and is listed at no. 29 in Top 100 Cars from 2001.\nBoth cars were designed by Enrico Fumia at Pininfarina. The GTV was planned to re-establish the sporty coupe tradition of Alfa Romeo for the 1990s. The design dates back to initial renderings of September 1987 and first clay models to complete 1:1 scale model in July 1988. After Vittorio Ghidella (Fiat CEO) accepted the design, Centro Stile Alfa Romeo under Walter de Silva was responsible for the completion of the detail work and also for the design of the interiors, as Pininfarina's proposal was not accepted. The Spider and GTV were based on the then-current Fiat Group compact car platform, called \"Tipo Due\" (or Type 2), in this case a heavily modified version with an all new multilink rear suspension. The front suspension and drivetrain was based on the 1992 Alfa Romeo 155 saloon. Chief engineer at that time was Bruno Cena. Drag coefficient was 0.33 for the GTV and 0.38 for the Spider.\n\nIt is a typical Italian design, with the Alfa Romeo grille with dual round headlights (motif later used on Alfa Romeo Proteo), it is low-slung, wedge-shaped with a low nose and high kicked up tail. The back of the car is \"cut-off\" with a \"Kamm tail\" giving improved aerodynamics. The Spider shares these traits with the GTV except that the rear is rounded. The Spider featured a folding soft-top with five hoop frame, which completely disappears from sight under a flush fitting cover. An electric folding mechanism was fitted as an option.\n\nDetails included a one-piece rear lamp/foglamp/indicator strip across the rear of the body, the minor instruments in the centre console angled towards the driver. At its launch, many journalists commented that Alfa had improved overall build quality considerably and that it came very close to equalling its German rivals.\n\n\nThe GTV was initially offered with 2.0 TS or 2.0 V6 Turbo, while Spider with 2.0 TS or 3.0 V6 12V.\n\nThe exterior design was finished in July 1988. Production began in late 1993 with four cars, all 3.0 V6 Spiders, assembled at the Alfa Romeo Arese Plant in Milan. In early 1994 the first GTV was produced, with 2.0 Twin Spark engine. The first premiere was then held at the Paris Motor Show in 1994. The GTV and Spider were officially launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1995 and sales began the same year. V6 Turbo GTVs had two air intakes on the lower lip, one for oil cooler and other for intercooler. Early V6 Spiders lacked any additional intakes as the oil cooler was mounted in front of the radiator. The car was produced in three distinct phases. The Phase 1 cars had a black plastic grille in the nose of the bonnet, without the chrome edging and black-painted sills all round.\n\nIn 1997 (Phase 1b) a new engine, a 24-valve 3.0 litre V6, was available for the GTV, The new 24V car also came equipped with a new 16\" 5 hole 'teledial' wheel design to provide extra clearance for the larger, brakes and red four-pot calipers from Brembo. Further exterior changes were new rear badging 'V6 24V' denoting the fitment of the new engine, and V6 Turbo-sourced front bumper lip with just one intake on the right hand side to allow air flow to front mounted oil cooler. Some versions were upgraded with different front bumper mesh to bring the wind noise down to 74 dBA.\n\nOn the interior, pleated leather seats from MOMO were offered in White, Red and Tan. These seats came with respective matching colored carpet, pleated leather door card inserts as well as optional color coded stitching around, hand brake, gear lever and the stitching of an all new three-spoke steering wheel. First RHD cars from this generation retained the original, four-spoke, steering wheel.\n\nIn May 1998 the cars were revamped for the first time (Phase 2), mainly the interior was changed with new center console, painted letters on skirt seals, changed controls and switches arrangement and different instrument cluster. On the exterior main changes included chrome frame around the grille and color-coded side skirts and bumpers. A new engine was introduced, the 1.8 Twin Spark, and others were changed: the 2.0 Twin Spark was updated with a modular intake manifold with different length intakes and a different plastic cover. Power output of the 2.0 TS was raised to . Engines changed engine management units and have a nomenclature of CF2. The dashboard was available in two new colours in addition to the standard black: Red Style and Blue Style, and with it new colour-coded upholstery and carpets. 3.0 24V got a six-speed manual gearbox as an optional extra. The 2.0 V6 TB engine was now also available for the Spider. From this generation every V6-engined car had additional air intakes on the lower lip.\n\nIn August 2000 (Phase 2b), engines were revamped to comply with new Euro3 emission standards. The units were slightly detuned and have a new identification code \"CF3\". The 3.0 V6 12V was discontinued for the Spider and replaced with the 24V version from the GTV, now only with 6-speed manual gearbox. The 2.0 V6 Turbo and 1.8 T.Spark were discontinued also and, for MY 2001, the engine range comprised only the 2.0 T.Spark and 3.0 V6 24V, until the \"Phase 3\" engine range arrived. The GTV/Spider were the last Alfa Romeo cars made at the Arese plant, which closed with production moving to Pininfarina, at its Giorgio Canavese plant in Turin, in October 2000.\n\nIn 2003 a new and last revamp arrived (Phase 3), also designed in Pininfarina but not by Enrico Fumia. Main changes are focused on the front with new 147-style grille and different front bumpers with offset numberplate holder. Change in interior was minimal with different center console and upholstery pattern and colours available. Instrument illumination colour was changed from green to red. Main specification change is an ASR traction control, not available for 2.0 TS Base model. New engines were introduced: 2.0 JTS with direct petrol injection and 3.2 V6 24V allowing top speed.\n\nBy the end of 2004 production ended at Pininfarina's plant. Some cars were still available for purchase till 2006.\n\nThe engine range included of the GTV and Spider included the in-line 4-cylinder:\nas well as the V6:\n\nThe turbocharged 2.0-litre V6, called V6 TB, was developed because of Italy's fiscal policy imposing a higher sales taxes on cars powered by engines with a capacity of more than 2.0-litre. It is basically a sleeved-down version of the 3.0-litre V6 engine. The turbo provided extra power while avoiding the higher tax. Both the 12-valve V6 engines have a redline of about 6,500 rpm, while 16 and 24-valve engines have 7,000 rpm.\n\nThe 2.0-litre 16-valve Twin Spark engine of the 2.0 TS model was based on the Fiat SuperFIRE-family block, featuring an Alfa Romeo-developed cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder. Variable inlet cam timing, which allowed for 25 degrees of variation, was designed to improve torque and give a more linear power delivery. In addition, this engine has two belt driven balance shafts rotating at twice the engine speed, to eliminate engine vibrations. The base 1.8-litre engine did not feature balance shafts. The TS was the best-selling version of the GTV and Spider. CF2 and CF3 engines have plastic valve cover and variable-length intake manifold.\n\nAt its time, the 3.2 V6 24V GTV was fastest road going Alfa Romeo, capable of 0–100 km/h in just over six seconds and a top speed of .\n\nThe last restyle of the GTV in 2003 saw the introduction of new 4-cylinder engines, in the form of the 2.0-litre JTS, with a power output of and featuring direct fuel injection, similar to systems used on diesel engines. The JTS engine uses only one spark plug per cylinder but retained variable-length inlet manifold and variable valve timing on intake camshaft.\n\n\"<nowiki>*performance values for GTV, unless otherwise stated</nowiki>\"\n\"<nowiki>**top speed with aerokit</nowiki> + for all, + for 3.0 V6 24V\"\n\n\"<nowiki>*factory data</nowiki>\"\n\nThe GTV/Spider was equipped as standard with power steering, driver and passenger airbag, automatic air conditioning, front seatbelt pretensioners, Bosch ABS (with EBD from 1998), electric heated door mirrors, electric frameless windows with one-touch operation for the driver's side, height adjustable headlamps, front and rear foglights, third brake light, fire prevention system, reach and rake adjustable leather clad steering wheel, stitched leather gear knob, an automatic electric aerial, a stereo radio/cassette with six speakers and central locking with Alfa-CODE immobiliser, internal electric release for the bootlid and filler flap. The additional options were: alarm system, passenger-side airbag installation/removal, electric heated seats (GTV only), metallic paint, iridescent paint (only with Lusso trim), leather MOMO seats (only with Lusso trim) and electric sunroof (GTV only). For the Spider some cars could be equipped with an electric hood folding mechanism.\n\nThe Lusso was a separate trim rather than an option pack and the standard car was renamed the \"Turismo\" from \"Medio\" in the UK. Medio and Lusso trims on phase 1 and 2 cars were available with almost any engine, except for Medio-only 1.8 L TS. Phase 3 cars were divided into Medio-only 2.0 L JTS and Lusso-only 3.2 L V6, also available was \"Base\" M.Y. 2003 2.0 L TS.\n\nBlue Style and Red Style interiors were available with Lusso trim on Phase 2 and on all Phase 3 cars. Blue Style consisted of blue dashboard and white or blue leather MOMO seats, while Red Style had red dashboard with red or black leather MOMO seats. Rest of the equipment and options remain unchanged. With standard black dashboard there were 4 leather MOMO seat colours to choose from (excluding limited editions): black, red and tan. Also light-grey but only for Spider. On Phase 1 cars the leather MOMO seats were available in 3 colours: red, tan and white.\n\nAll CF3 versions have three catalytic converters installed, two of them at the exhaust manifold. Previous CF1 and CF2 engines had only one catalytic converter.\n\nThe fuel tank has a capacity of . The battery is located in the boot of the GTV or in the storage compartment behind the seats of the Spider. The optional CD auto changer is located in the boot, and the fuel tank is ahead of the rear axle line, behind the rear seats for increased safety. The power assisted steering has a very high ratio, giving 2.2 turns lock-to-lock. The bonnet and bootlid are supported on nitrogen filled struts. A spacesaver spare wheel was supplied, and there was a no-cost option of an aerosol can of tyre repair sealant. This was a factory standard from 1998 as it increased the usable size of the very small boot to .\n\nTo save weight the bonnet was made from a composite material called KMC (composed of polyester and fiberglass, and using epoxi adhesives also), while front wings were made in PUR plastic. At the time, the bonnet was the largest single composite moulding on a production car. When the bonnet is opened, two rectangular Hella headlamps are revealed with separate bulbs for dip and main beam, behind the four round holes in the bonnet. The bodyshell was galvanised with full plastic wheelarch liners and is therefore rustproof. Weight distribution for four cylinder engined car is 61% front/39% rear and for a V6 is 63% front/37% rear\n\nAs would be expected, the GTV has a much more rigid chassis, up to 64% stiffer, although considerable work was done on the Spider to reduce the traditional convertible problem of scuttle shake. Spider also features a reinforced A-pillars.\n\nWheels are 15 inch perforated steel as standard, 16 inch teardrop alloy wheels with 205/50 tyres were part of the Lusso option package. From Phase 2 and 3 16 inch teardrop alloy wheels became standard with factory option of 17 inch alloy wheels and 225/45 tyres. Only from Phase 3 (not including earlier limited editions) did Spider receive 17 inch wheels option.\n\nCriticisms of the model have been that it is hard to park due to its large turning circle (11,2 m on most cars) and low seating position, which mean that the end of the bonnet and corners are outside the driver's line of sight. The doors are very long and need plenty of space in a car park.\n\"*from: sales brochures, owners manuals and repair manuals\"\n\nThe front suspension utilises a fairly conventional set-up that comprises MacPherson struts, offset coil springs, lower wishbones and an anti-roll bar.\n\nThe independent, multiple arm rear suspension comprises quadrilateral geometry with an upper triangle, double lower arms, coil springs and anti-roll bar secured to a light alloy subframe which is, in turn, mounted onto the car's body. The design of this geometry, and the fine tuning of the bushes, is such that during initial stages of a turn, the centrifugal forces create a small 'rear wheel steer' effect in the opposite direction to the way the front wheels are being pointed. Then, as the centrifugal forces build up through the corner, the rear wheels start steering in the same direction as the front wheels. The result is a more positive 'attack' into the first stages of cornering and increased stability in the later stages. This multilink rear suspension was designed by Gianclaudio Travaglio.\n\nCars have disc brakes all round, while most versions had Lucas or ATE system ventilated-discs at the front, some Spiders (1.8 TS and 2.0 TS) had Altecna-system. 3.0 V6 24V GTV and Spider had Brembo-system ventilated-discs with 4-pot calipers painted red with white 'Alfa Romeo\" lettering. 3.2 V6 cars had the same 305 mm discs, even though GTA cars were later upgraded to 330 mm. All cars had Lucas-system solid-discs at the back.\n\"*stated by Pininfarina production records\"\n\"**stated by Robert Foskett: Alfa Romeo 916 GTV and Spider: The Complete Story\"\n\nThere were numerous limited edition GTV and Spider available. All can be categorized into 4 groups: Edizione Sportiva GTV 2001, Special Series 2001, Limited Editions 2002 and Special Series 2004. Almost all have the titanium-like finished center console without the Alfa Romeo script. All Special Series (except for some German-market Edizione Classica) cars have a silver numbered plaque on the side of the center console. All of the cars except for the first have unique version codes. All Spiders have electrically operated hood. All cars are in Lusso-trim equipment. Total numbers for each limited edition vary from as little as 8 or 10 to 419 or 700. Apart from producer sanctioned editions there were also few importer exclusive editions made for particular markets like Australia or Japan.\n\nThe GTV Cup is a limited edition inspired by the mono-make Alfa GTV Cup race series in Italy. Only 419 cars were built in total, with 264 LHD versions and 155 RHD versions. Two different engines were used in the production: 180 cars were built with the 3.0 V6 24V (all 155 RHD versions were 3.0 models) and 239 cars with 2.0 Twin Sparks. The 3.0 V6 cars were only painted in Alfa Romeo Red while 2.0 TS cars were almost exclusively painted in Grigio Chiaro (there are just a few examples in red). Limited edition plaques, that were made of silver, differed for the RHD and LHD versions, having red and black texts accordingly and each run was separately numbered (i.e. there is both a LHD 001 and a RHD 001). Differences between the standard GTV and the Cup version are factory fitted rear spoiler, front spoiler, side skirts, wheel arch side vents and titanium-like finish 17-inch 'telephone dial' alloys;, although mechanically they are the same as the regular specifications.

{"id": "2326831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326831", "title": "Jack Sikma", "text": "Jack Sikma\n\nJack Wayne Sikma (born November 14, 1955) is an American former professional basketball center. He was a seven-time NBA All-Star with the Seattle SuperSonics, who drafted him in the first round with the eighth overall pick of the 1977 NBA draft. In 1979, he won an NBA championship with Seattle. Sikma finished his playing career with the Milwaukee Bucks. He was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nHe was known for his trademark reverse pivot and step back behind-the-head jumper, coined as the \"Sikma move\", along with his distinctive curly, blond hair during his playing days. During his thirteen-year career, he reached the playoffs eleven times and anomalously established himself as an accurate-shooting center. His style of play would become significantly influential for centers at both the amateur and professional levels. Sikma scored 17,287 points in his NBA career.\n\nSikma was born in Kankakee, Illinois to Grace and Clarence Sikma and attended St. Anne High School in St. Anne, Illinois. He lived in rural Wichert, Illinois growing up. Sikma was a guard his first three years of high school, before a growth spurt had him at 6'10\" going into his senior season. Nicknamed \"the Wichert Wonder,\" Sikma led the St. Anne High School Cardinals to a fourth-place finish in the 1974 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class A boys basketball tournament, scoring 100 points in his four tournament games.\n\nSikma played at collegiately at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois, graduating in 1977 and majoring in accounting. After being heavily recruited by many Division I schools, Sikma was swayed by his close relationship with Illinois Wesleyan Coach Dennie Bridges and being able to immediately play as a freshman. Sikma also liked that Illinois Wesleyan had several Division I schools on their schedule.\n\nAt Illinois Wesleyan, Sikma was a three-time National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) All-American and averaged 27.0 points and 15.4 rebounds as a senior. Sikma was chosen as the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) Most Outstanding Player for three straight years. He was later inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame (2012), the Small Schools Basketball Hall of Fame (2017) and was a member of the NAIA 50th & 75th All-Anniversary Teams. He was also a two-time Academic All-American and was selected to the CoSIDA Academic All-American Hall of Fame (1999).\n\nAt Wesleyan, Sikma remains the school's all-time leading scorer and rebounder averaging 21.2 points (2,272 career points) and 13.1 rebounds (1,405 career rebounds). In each of his last three seasons, the Titans won College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin Conference Championships and advanced to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Tournament.\n\nSikma was a first round pick, drafted with the eighth overall selection in the 1977 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. Due to the relatively small size of his alma mater, Sikma was considered an unknown quantity compared to the \"established, well‐publicized stars\" taken before him.\n\nAs a rookie in 1977-1978, Sikma averaged 10.7 points and 8.3 rebounds, as the Sonics played in NBA Finals, losing to the Washington Bullets in seven games. Sikma was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in 1978.\n\nThe next season, 1978-1979, Sikma averaged 15.6 points and 12.4 rebounds and became an All-Star. With Sikma averaging a double-double of 14.8 points and 11.7 rebounds in the playoffs, Sikma and teammates Dennis Johnson, Gus Williams and Paul Silas, defeated the Washington Bullets and Wes Unseld in a NBA Finals rematch. Sikma's final free throws were the last points scored by the Sonics to win the series.\n\nIn 1984, Sikma signed a five-year contract with the Supersonics. Sonics General Manager Les Habegger remarked, \"After careful consideration, we concluded that we could look far and wide and never obtain another center of his caliber.\" Sikma continued his All-Star caliber play, but was forced to undergo finger surgery in 1985.\n\nWith the Supersonics, Sikma was selected to seven consecutive All-Star Games, from 1979 to 1985. In nine seasons and 715 games with Seattle, Sikma averaged a double-double of 16.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, along with 3.3 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.0 blocks, shooting 47% from the field and 83% from the line.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs for two years, Sikma requested a trade from Seattle. In 1986, Sikma and Seattle's 1988 second round draft pick were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Alton Lister and Milwaukee's first-round draft picks in 1987 and 1989. Later in response, \"Sports Illustrated\" would report:\nMilwaukee Coach Don Nelson felt Sikma was the missing piece of a team that had frequently dominated the regular season before being exposed at the center position in the playoffs. Milwaukee struggled with injuries leading to the playoffs.\n\nIn the initial playoff series, Sikma scored 11 points in the fourth quarter to get past Charles Barkley and the Philadelphia 76ers. In the next series, the Bucks were defeated by the Boston Celtics in a seven-game series, which included Sikma being one of eight players fined for fighting or leaving the bench to join the brawl.\n\nDuring the pre-season, Sikma and the Bucks participated in the diplomatically oriented Basketball Open, a round-robin, exhibition tournament, which included a match with the U.S.S.R. national team and the Italian national team (a country where Sikma was particularly popular).\n\nWith the Bucks, Sikma showed his superb shooting skills and made the playoffs every year for the remainder of his career. Despite being the team's center, Sikma was one of the most effective free-throw shooters in the league and he would shoot technical free throws for the team, Sikma set a then-record of 51 games without a free throw miss. His late-career three point shooting was cited as a sign of league-wide adoption.\n\nIn 1989, he would face his former team in would what was then the longest game in the shot clock era, winning in the fifth overtime.\n\nInto his final season, Sikma remained an effective big man, playing 77 regular season games and three playoff games, including twice grabbing 14 rebounds in a game.\n\nIn five seasons and 392 games with Milwaukee, Sikma averaged 13.4 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists, shooting 45% from the floor and 88% from the line.\n\nSikma averaged a double-double in points and rebounds in eight seasons, always averaged double points-per-game figures throughout his career, and after his stint with the Sonics, he maintained consistent numbers while playing with the Milwaukee Bucks in his final five seasons. For his career, Sikma averaged 15.6 points (17,287 in total) and 9.8 rebounds (10,816) over 14 seasons and 1107 games.\n\nSikma was one of the most accurate shooting centers in NBA history. He holds the rare distinction of leading the league in free-throw percentage (92.2%) while playing the center position during the 1987–88 season; he averaged 84.9% in free-throw shooting for his career. Sikma also made over 200 three-pointers during his career with a 32.8% three-point accuracy.\n\nAlong with his accurate shooting, Sikma led the league in defensive rebounds in both 1981–82 and 1983–84.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007, Sikma was a Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach.\n\nIn June 2007 Sikma was hired by the Houston Rockets as an assistant coach under Coach Rick Adelman. Among his duties was tutoring center Yao Ming in \"big man\" playing strategies.\n\nOn December 6, 2011, he was signed as an assistant coach by the Minnesota Timberwolves, again under Adelman.\n\nBeginning in 2017, Sikma acted as a coaching consultant for the Toronto Raptors, particularly working with center Jonas Valančiūnas.\n\nSikma was a pioneer as one of the earliest sharp-shooting big men, a role that would become common after the turn of the 21st century. As a center, Sikma's distinct shot and uncharacteristic accuracy allowed him to play a role outside of the paint. His signature Sikma-1/Sikma-2 moves were key to future agile centers with agility and shooting touch. Instructional coach Pete Newell wrote on Sikma's signature move in his 2008 book, \"Playing Big\" as \"baseline moves for loose defenses. Towards the end of his career where his lack of athleticism prevented Sikma from using his eponymous move and no other big men appeared be able to replicate it, he stated that coaches were inquiring him about the technique, even though he believed it would be defunct upon his retirement.\n\nSikma's overall strength and height, combined with his shooting ability and rebounding become a more common prototype long after his retirement, with protegees like Yao Ming and Kevin Love becoming quality players in the NBA. On a January 2019 NBA TV segment, former players Chris Webber, Isiah Thomas, and Kevin McHale discussed his unexpected influence on modern-day basketball play with a segment entitled, \"Jack Sikma's moves still being used today\", discussing common moves taller players have since adopted to utilize their shooting and passing abilities. The \"stretch 5\" has since become common in the NBA, with the number of three pointers made by centers sharply increasing. His Sikma moves remains widely taught in amateur basketball, including being one of College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Bo Ryan's five required skills for his team's big men, being cited by local, girls' basketball coaches in 2019, and being strongly touted by college players born well after Sikma's retirement.\n\nSikma lived in Medina, Washington. A long-time Seattle-area resident, Sikma sold his mansion to Bill Gates in 1997 as a temporary residence while Gates's own mansion was being built.\n\nSikma's son, Luke Sikma, played for the University of Portland Pilots, and plays professionally in Germany. Sikma's son, Nate, played for the University of Hartford Hawks men's basketball team.\n\nAmerican speed skater Bonnie Blair cited Sikma as an early sponsor before she won her Olympic medals.\n\n\n\n"}

His brother, Frederick Doulton, became Member of Parliament for Lambeth from 1862 until 1868. His father had become a partner in a pottery business in 1815 but Henry was the most academic of his children. Henry spent two years at the University College School where he developed a love of literature. His father had thought Henry the least likely to join the family business, perhaps being destined for a profession, but in 1835, he joined the firm, as did all his brothers other than Frederick.\n\nOne of the first results of his many experiments was the production of good enamel glazes. In 1846 he initiated in Lambeth the pipe works, in which he superintended the manufacture of the drainage and sanitary appliances which have helped to make the firm of Doulton famous.\n\nIn 1870 the manufacture of \"Art pottery\" was begun at Lambeth, using the skills of students from the Lambeth School of Art (later the City and Guilds of London Art School). The company exhibited at the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia. In 1877 works were opened at Burslem, where almost every variety of porcelain and earthenware has been produced. Works have since been opened at Rowley Regis, Smethwick, St Helens, Paisley and Paris. After the Paris exhibition of 1878, Henry Doulton was made a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur.\n\nIn 1872, the Art department was instituted in the Doulton works, giving employment to both male and female artists, among whom such workers as George Tinworth and Misses Hannah and Florence Barlow obtained a reputation outside their immediate sphere.\nOn 12 August 1887, Doulton received the honour of a knighthood, a few years after he was awarded the Albert Medal by the Royal Society of Arts in 1885.\n\nDoulton died at his residence, 10 Queen's Gate Gardens, London, on 17 November 1897, and was buried at Norwood cemetery. The business was turned into a joint-stock company in 1899. \n\nAppropriately after his death in London, he was placed in a mausoleum at West Norwood Cemetery constructed from red pottery tiles and bricks from the Doulton Works, which is now a Grade II Listed building.\n\nIn 1849 he married Sarah, the daughter of Elizabeth and James Lewis Kennaby.\nThey had three children, Sarah Lillian (1852–), Henry Lewis (1853–1930), and Katherine Duneau (1856–1932). His wife Sarah died in 1888. Sir Henry Doulton took an active interest, as almoner, in St Thomas' Hospital.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2326835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326835", "title": "Thunder Over Louisville", "text": "Thunder Over Louisville\n\nThunder Over Louisville, the annual kickoff event of the Kentucky Derby Festival, is an airshow and fireworks display in Louisville, Kentucky. It is generally held each April, about two weeks before the first Saturday in May, or Derby Day. In years where Easter Sunday falls on the usually scheduled weekend, Thunder is moved a week earlier. It is the largest annual fireworks display in North America and began as part of an opening ceremonies event in 1989 with daytime fireworks. 1990 brought the first nighttime fireworks event. It officially began in its current location along the Ohio River in 1991 with fireworks, and an annual air show was added in 1992.\n\nThunder generally starts in the afternoon with an air show, followed by the fireworks show starting at 9:30 PM, along with a synchronized soundtrack through PA and radio. An average of 625,000 people have attended each year since 1997, lining the banks of the Ohio River in Louisville, and across the river in Jeffersonville and Clarksville, Indiana. Some also watch from the river on boats, docked in positions auctioned off for charity.\n\nEight 400-foot barges launch the fireworks, provided by Zambelli Fireworks Internationale, from both sides of the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge (Second Street Bridge), and more fireworks are launched from the bridge itself.\n\nIn the twenty-first century the estimated attendance at Thunder has usually been approximately five times that of the main attraction, the Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs.\n\nThunder Over Louisville began as a concept at a Kentucky Derby Festival workshop in the summer of 1988, after a decision had been made to have opening ceremonies for the first time.\n\nThe first opening ceremonies were held in 1989 at the Chow Wagon on the river and broadcast live to the They're Off! Luncheon crowd at the Galt House East. Organized by multimedia producer Wayne Hettinger, owner of Visual Presentations, they featured a live stage show to introduce the festival theme song and the release of about 20,000 multicolored balloons — followed by daytime fireworks. Attendance was estimated at 10,000.\n\nThe first nighttime fireworks show was in 1990 at Cardinal Stadium in the Kentucky Exposition Center, where more than 35,000 people attended a Derby Festival opening ceremonies concert by Janie Fricke and a 4,000-shell fireworks show following a sold out Louisville Redbirds baseball game.\n\nFireworks had been used in Derby festivities since the 1960s, but the positive impact of fireworks on this concert—particularly the echoing sound—led to the firework show's name when it was held the following year over the Ohio River.\n\nIn 1991 the event moved to Waterfront Park, and Zambelli Fireworks Internationale's Master Pyrotechnician Raymond M Loffredo began handling the fireworks. The Air Show began in 1992, and has featured such notable aircraft as the Harrier, the B-2 (Stealth Bomber), and the F-117 (Stealth Fighter) as well as the Apache Attack Helicopter.\n\nThe event expanded rapidly in scale and attendance; by 1996 more shells were exploded in the first minute than in the entire 1990 show. In 1997, the Air Force designated Thunder Over Louisville as one of the events for its 50th anniversary celebration. More than 125 military aircraft performed that year, making it the largest combined fireworks and air show in the United States.\n\nThe event relies heavily on corporate donations. In 2000, when Kroger pulled out after 10 years of sponsorship, the Kentucky Derby Festival was left scrambling for money. They announced the Thunder Funder program, in which individuals can make small donations. In 2006, McDonald's announced that they would be the title sponsor for Thunder Funder and donate 10 cents from the sale of every 32-ounce drink in a commemorative cup to the Derby Festival. This promotion continued until 2014. In 2015, the restaurant chain pledged $100,000 to the event.\n\nThe fireworks show has grown in size and scope every year, with over 52,000 shells used in 2004, and 60,000 in 2005. The fireworks show usually lasts 30 minutes. There is traditionally a 3-minute finale which organizers call by the name Gargantuan. This is usually preceded by a short break in the fireworks and an audio score of \"The Colonel Bogey March\" as whistled in the movie \"Bridge on the River Kwai\", often catching first time spectators, who believe the show has ended, by surprise.\n\nThe 2007 event had a record crowd, whose size was estimated at 850,000 by the event producer. Such counts do not include thousands of people who watch from area rooftops at \"Thunder parties\" held by individuals with proximity advantaged addresses in downtown, Old Louisville, Portland and the Butchertown neighborhood immediately upriver from downtown, as well as river adjacent neighborhoods in the Indiana communities of Clarksville and Jeffersonville.\n\nIn 2010, a computer glitch 30 seconds before the show during a pre-recorded minute long audio countdown to the fireworks caused an 18-minute delay while the problem was troubleshooted.\n\nIn 2020, coronavirus concerns caused the event to be rescheduled for August 15, 2020, with the Kentucky Derby itself being rescheduled for Labor Day weekend at around the exact same time, this marks the very first time the event itself has been rescheduled.\n\nDue to the complexity of the event, including road closures, police presence, and technical requirements, there is no rain date for Thunder. The event has never been canceled. Officials would cancel if severe weather or lightning was imminent, and the fireworks could be delayed if heavy rain or wind was occurring at the time of the show.\n\nIn 2005, unseasonably cold weather brought a temperature of 38 at 8:30 PM, an hour before the fireworks. A brief downpour of heavy sleet cleared all but an estimated 10,000 spectators from the riverfront by fireworks time.\n\nIn 2011, temperatures in the 40s caused a much lower attendance than usual.\n\nOhio River flooding was a concern for the 2015 event, but organizers did not let the high water cancel the festivities. It did make some traditional viewing areas inaccessible and additional safety precautions had to be taken to make the show possible.\n\nThunder Over Louisville has been televised locally since its first year. The 2007 show was the first to be broadcast entirely in HDTV. Previously, two or three HDTV cameras supplemented the broadcast. TV coverage of the fireworks received record ratings in 2006 due to cold temperatures which made many people choose to watch the show from home.\n\nIn 2005, The Kentucky Derby Festival started rotating the broadcast rights each year between 3 of the major Louisville network affiliates (WAVE-TV, WDRB, and WLKY). After airing the coverage exclusively from 1991-2003, WHAS-TV chose not to participate in the rotation for several years after this agreement was made. They have since entered the rotation. The show is traditionally rebroadcast on the 4th of July, on the U.S. military's American Forces Network. \n\nSince 2014, Thunder Over Louisville has been streamed live on the online media site TV 24.\n\n!Year!!

In 1939, he became an assistant to Wolfgang Krull at the University of Bonn. His main work was on the foundations of mathematics—proof theory. He created and modified constructive mathematics. Lorenzen taught at Stanford, the University of Texas, and Boston University in the USA. He was John Locke Lecturer in 1967/1968.\n\nLorenzen came in 1962 to University of Erlangen (South Germany) and founded the Erlangen School of epistemological constructivism there.\n\nHe wrote with Wilhelm Kamlah the famous book \"Logical Propaedeutic\" (\"Logische Propädeutik\") and worked on game semantics (\"Dialogische Logik\") with Kuno Lorenz. With Peter Janich he invented \"protophysics\" of time and space. He developed constructive logic, constructive type theory and constructive analysis.\n\nLorenzen's work on calculus \"Differential and Integral\" was dedicated to Hermann Weyl. Lorenzen used Weyl's technique to develop a predicative analysis, which can reconstruct classical analysis, without the principle of excluded middle or the Axiom of Choice. He worked also on Gerhard Gentzen's cut elimination to find a way to continue Hilbert's program after the results of Gödel.\n\nIn the theory of geometry and physics, Lorenzen was influenced by Hugo Dingler. He followed Dingler in building up geometry and physics out of primitive operations. Lorenzen took an early interpretation of Steven Weinberg (Gravitation and Cosmology, 1972) for his doubts about geometrical elements of general relativity, believing that Maxwell's equations are to be modified by general relativity instate.\n\nLorenzen was also influenced by Wilhelm Dilthey's hermeneutics, and liked to quote Dilthey's saying that knowledge cannot go behind life. Dilthey's \"Lebensphilosophie\" was the description of the setting in ordinary experience in which we construct the abstractions of mathematics and physics.\n\nAs John Locke Lecturer he invented normative Logic as a base on ethics and political argumentation.\n\n\n\n"}
