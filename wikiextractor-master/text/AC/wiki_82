{"id": "2159600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159600", "title": "Kunar Province", "text": "Kunar Province\n\nKunar (, ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northeastern part of the country. Its capital is Asadabad. It has a population of about 428,800.\n\nIt is one of the four \"N2KL\" provinces (Nangarhar Province, Nuristan Province, Kunar Province and Laghman Province). N2KL is the designation used by the US and Coalition Forces in Afghanistan for the rugged and very violent region along the Durand Line border opposite Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Kunar is the center of the N2KL region. Kunar is the birthplace of Sayyed Jamaluddin Afghani (al-Afghani), an influential Muslim scholar and philosopher.\n\nKunar province is located in the northeast of Afghanistan. It borders with Nangarhar Province to the south, Nuristan Province to the north, Laghman Province to the west and has a border with Pakistan in the east. The province covers an area of 4339 km. Nearly nine tenths (86%) of the province is mountainous or semi mountainous terrain while one eighth (12%) of the area is made up of relatively flat land. The primary geographic features of the province are (1) the lower Hindu Kush mountains which are cut by the Kunar River to form the Kunar Valley. The river flows south and southwest from its source in the Pamir area and is part of the Indus River watershed via the Kabul River which it meets at Jalalabad. The Kunar is a primary draining conduit for the Hindu Kush basin and several tributaries, including the Pech, which form distinct and significant valleys in the area. The mountains, narrow valleys with steep walls, and rivers present formidable natural obstacles and have historically constrained all movement through the province. Even in the early 21st century, movement on foot, with pack animals, or with motorized vehicles is extremely limited and channeled due to the significant geographic restrictions.\n\nThe region has been part of many empires in the past, from the Seleucid Empire to the latest Afghan Durrani Empire. Many famous historical figures are believed to have visited the area, including Alexander the Great, Mahmud Ghaznavi, Xuanzang, Ibn Battuta, and others. Archaeologists have dated to AD 800-1000 a fortification system overlooking a Muslim cemetery at Chaga Serai (near the Pech-Kunar confluence).\n\nBabur wrote about Kunar in \"Baburnama\". He claimed that there was a shrine in Kunar of a preacher and poet Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, who is said to have died there in 1384 AD (786 AH). He also describes agricultural products: citron, oranges, coriander, orchards, strong yellow wines, and a burial custom wherein a woman whose corpse moved was considered to have done good things in life. He mentions Chaghan-Sarai as a small town, and describes the towns folk as Muslims who mixed with the Kafirs of nearby Kafiristan and followed some of their customs. He also claims to have later captured the town, even as the Pech river Kafirs tried to help the Chaghan Sarai residents repel his attack.\n\nWalter Hamilton's writing in 1828 mentions that the padishah of Cooner was joined in alliance with the neighboring Kafirs (non Muslims) of Nuristan in battles against Muslim invaders. The Kafirs were forcibly converted by Abdur Rahman Khan in the 1890s.\nSome British sources from the Great Game period (1800s) go into more detail about Kunar. For example, one from 1881 describes the various Kunar Chiefs and their internecine wars, the conflict with Dost Mohammad Khan, their relations with the British, etc. Names vary greatly, with Kunar sometimes being called Kama, or Kashkote, and the capital being listed as \"Pashoot\", which is not on modern maps.\nAn 1891 book described the Kunar region as split between the lower river area, controlled by Afghan chiefs, and the upstream area, where the Kunar river was actually referred to as the Chitral river. The major town of Chitral (in modern Pakistan) was the base of a badshah, who ruled under the Maharajah of Kashmir\n\nAccording to a US Army paper, the Pashtuns of Kunar and the Kafirs of Kunar/Nuristan eventually joined together in the 20th century. Fundamentalist religion came to the region in the 1950s but the heavy unification happened during the Soviet–Afghan War (1979–88). Some of the first anti-government forces (lashkar) rose in the Kunar region.\n\nKerala, a town near Asadabad, was the site of the 1979 Kerala massacre, where the male population of a village was allegedly murdered by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and its Soviet advisors.\n\nLater, over ten-thousand Soviet and Afghan communist troops invaded the region, resulting in a massive refugee flow of the populace into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. There were Spetsnaz units based in Asadabad (where the Pech meets the Kunar), in Jalalabad (where the Kunar meets the Kabul), and other towns. The major mujahideen groups had representation in the area, and were successful enough to confine the Communist troops for the most part to their fortifications in the major towns of the Kunar valley.\n\nEventually one of the Mujahideen leaders, Jamil al-Rahman, formed a movement that had a very strict interpretation of Islam, along the lines of Wahhabism and/or Salafism. He was supported by elements in Saudi Arabia, and later attracted many Saudis and Egyptians who had come to Afghanistan to fight Jihad.\n\nWhen the Soviets left in 1988, the leader of the Mujahideen group Hizb-i-Islami, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, began to fight with Jamil al-Rahman over control of the area. Hekmatyar was victorious and eventually his troops sacked Asadabad. By 1996 however, Mullah Omar's Taliban had invaded Kunar and driven out Hekmatyar.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks of 2001, Afghanistan was invaded by United States and other NATO countries provided direct support to the Northern Alliance forces fighting the Taliban regime, which was quickly toppled and fled to remote areas. It was part of the War on Terror and to assist the new government that was led by Hamid Karzai.\n\nDuring the 19th century British military expeditions, the 1980s Soviet occupation, and the latest conflict, Kunar has been a favoured spot of insurgent groups. Its impenetrable terrain, cave networks and border with the semi-autonomous Pakistani Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provides significant advantages for unconventional warfare and militant groups. The province is informally known as \"Enemy Central\" and \"Indian Country\" by Western armed forces serving in Afghanistan. Between January 2006 and March 2010 more than 65% of all insurgent incidents in Afghanistan occurred in Kunar province.\n\nLike many of the mountainous eastern provinces of Afghanistan, the groups involved in armed conflict vary greatly in strength and purpose. Native Taliban forces mingle with foreign al-Qaeda fighters, while former mujahadeen militias, such as Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, continue to operate as they did in the chaotic post-Soviet years. Another strong militia in the region is the Hezbi Islami faction of the late Mulavi Younas Khalis, who had his headquarters in neighboring Nuristan Province.\n\nCompounding the problems of the province is an extensive cross-border trade in contraband which includes lumber, semi-precious stones and other natural resources. This smuggling activity is often organized along tribal lines, and has led to intense deforestation in some areas. The rugged border area has many illegal and hidden crossing points making Kunar a high traffic route for illegal arms transporting, insurgent movement as well as other smuggling activities as mentioned above.\nThe province, relatively small compared to others, has among the highest concentration of both US and Afghan security forces. Special Operations Forces operate extensively throughout the area.\n\nAs of September 2015 the United States has awarded twelve Medals of Honor for actions in Afghanistan. Six of these have been awarded for actions in Kunar province, and an additional four have been awarded for neighboring Nuristan Province.\n\nOperation Mountain Resolve in 2003 involved the 10th Mountain Division air dropping into Nuristan and traveling dozens of kilometers, including in Kunar, to fight what was termed \"Anti-Coalition Militia\" (ACM) activity.\n\nIn 2005 Operation Red Wings set out with the intent to disrupt ACM activity in the region in order to further aid the stabilization efforts of the region for the upcoming September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Anti-Coalition Militia activity in the region was carried out at the time most notably by a small group led by a local man named Ahmad Shah (from Nangarhar Province) who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence, hence he and his small group would be one of the primary targets of the operation. A team of four Navy SEALs, tasked for surveillance and reconnaissance of a group of structures known to be used by Ahmad Shah and his men, fell into an ambush by Shah and his group just hours after inserting by fastrope from an MH-47 helicopter in the area. Three of the four SEALs were killed in the ambush; a quick reaction force helicopter sent in for their aid was subsequently shot down with an RPG-7 rocket propelled grenade by one of Shah's men, 19 American Forces were killed when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down, representing the second biggest loss of American forces since their invasion of the country.\n\nAccording to Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik, Osama bin Laden was most likely hiding in Kunar Province in the spring and summer of 2009: \"According to our information Osama is in Afghanistan, probably Kunar, as most of the activities against Pakistan are being directed from Kunar.\" Bin Laden was later found and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, contrary to what the Pakistani government had previously stated. He had been living there since 2005.\n\nThe current governor of Kunar province is Wahidullah Kalimzai. His predecessor was Shuja ul-Mulk Jalala.\n\nThe city of Asadabad is the capital of Kunar. All law enforcement activities throughout the province are controlled by the Afghan National Police (ANP). Kunar's border with neighboring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is monitored and protected by the Afghan Border Police (ABP), which is part of the ANP. The border is called the Durand Line and is known to be one of the most dangerous in the world due to heavy militant activities and illegal smugglings. A provincial police chief is assigned to lead both the ANP and ABP. The police chief represents the Ministry of the Interior in Kabul. The ANP is backed by other Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), including the NATO-led forces.\n\nThe percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 24% in 2005 to 55% in 2011. The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 3% in 2005 to 13% in 2011.\n\nThe overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 32% in 2005 to 20% in 2011. The overall net enrollment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 43% in 2005 to 44% in 2011.\n\nAccording to latest statistics, the total population of Kunar province was estimated to be around 428,800. Which 95% are Pashun\n\nAround 96% of the population of Kunar lives in rural districts while 4% lives in urban areas.\n\nThe districts in Kunar Province as of March 2004 are:\n\nAsadabad hosts both an American Provincial Reconstruction Team at nearby Forward Operating Base Wright and a UNAMA development office. Additionally, representatives of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), US State and Agriculture Departments advise the local government. A US Army Agribusiness Development Team (ADT) was deployed to the province in late 2009. Successive ADTs continue to serve in the province.\n\nThe opening scenes of the 2008 film \"Iron Man\" take place in Kunar Province.\n\nThe 2010 documentary \"Restrepo\" was filmed in the Korengal Valley of Kunar Province.\n\nThe book \"Siren's Song: The Allure of War\" was published in 2012. It depicts the story of an American platoon at COP Honaker Miracle, Pesh valley, Kunar Province.\n\nThe Popular movie \"Lone Survivor\" starring Mark Wahlberg was based around \"Operation Red Wings\" in 2005 which was near Asadabad.\n\nDocumentary author James F. Christ has published numerous titles about the fighting in Kunar and Nuristan provinces, mainly from 2005 to 2007 with the 10th Mountain Division and Afghan National Army ETT advisors.\n\n"}

He was ordained in 1988 and was a member of the Dominican Order in 1981-95. The Congregation for the Clergy informed Alison of his laicization; he appealed this to the Pope and his current canonical status is inconclusive. Alison is noted for his application of René Girard's anthropological theory to Christian systematic theology and for his work on LGBT issues.\n\nJames Alison was born on October 10, 1959, the son of Michael Alison and Sylvia Alison (née Haigh). He has a brother and a sister. In \"Faith Beyond Resentment\" he describes his family background as \"conservative middle-class English evangelical Protestant\". His father was Michael Alison (died 2004) who, after leaving the University of Oxford, had spent some time studying theology at Ridley Hall and had gone on to become a prominent Conservative Member of Parliament (1964–1997) and Second Church Estates Commissioner (1987–1997). Alison left the Church of England at the age of eighteen to join the Roman Catholic Church. He studied at Blackfriars College at the University of Oxford, and earned his bachelor's degree and doctorate in theology from the Jesuit theology faculty in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.\n\nHe has lived and worked in Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and the United States. Currently he works as a travelling preacher, lecturer and retreat giver, based in Madrid, Spain.\n\nAlison was a member of the Dominican order – his master's degree is a Dominican lectorate – from 1981 to 1995. In 1996, he wrote to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith telling them that he believed his vows to be null as they were based on the \"false premise of gay people being objectively disordered and thus celibacy being obligatory\". He offered to let them issue a decree saying that his ordination was null, but they declined, saying it was valid. Instead, the congregation asked him to seek laicisation, but Alison declined: \"The form for doing that also required that lies to be told, so, on advice of a canon lawyer, I did nothing and heard nothing\". He told \"Commonweal\" magazine in 2012 that he was released from the Dominicans without penalty, and that he is uncertain of the validity of his vow of celibacy.\n\nMore than 10 years later, a superior in the Dominican order asked if Alison would object to his processing paperwork dismissing Alison from the order. Alison said he did not mind the paperwork, but would not participate as he believed he was never truly a member anyway. He eventually received a letter stating that he was a priest in good standing, not currently incardinated but available to be incardinated if a bishop wished to have him.\n\nWhile living in Brazil, the local bishop asked for Alison's consent to be laicized. Alison declined, but instead offered to be incardinated into the diocese. The bishop declined that offer. The bishop then began a process of laicization without Alison's consent using the norm designed for priest who left their ministry to get married and would not answer requests for cooperation; Alison believed this was not applicable in his situation. A year later, a letter from the Congregation for the Clergy arrived announcing that Alison had been laicized, forbidding him from teaching, preaching, or presiding. According to the letter, this decision was unappealable. For Alison, \"it was shocking to be tangential to a process in which it is unnecessary to inform the one charged of the charges against him, in which no legal representation is permitted, and whose sentence does not require the signature of the sentencee\". \n\nA friendly bishop, who was once Alison's novice master, hand delivered a letter to Pope Francis in May 2017 appealing his laicization. In the letter, Alison asked the Pope to make his situation regular; he proposed to treat the congregation's letter \"as null, and to carry on as before\". On 2 July 2017, Pope Francis called Alison directly. According to Alison, Pope Francis told him, \"I want you to walk with deep interior freedom, following the Spirit of Jesus. And I give you the power of the keys.\" Alison believes that, Pope Francis did not perceived the congregation's decision as binding; that he treated him as a priest and granted him the authority to hear confessions.\n\n\n"}

The styles also vary across regions in Korean Peninsula. \"Mandu\" were long part of Korean royal court cuisine, but are now found in supermarkets, restaurants, and snack places such as \"pojangmacha\" and \"bunsikjip\" throughout Korea.\n\nThe name is cognate with the names of similar types of meat-filled dumplings along the Silk Road in Central Asia, such as Uyghur \"manta\" (), Turkish ', Kazakh \"mänti\" (), Uzbek ', Afghan \"\" and Armenian \"mantʿi\" (). Chinese \"mántou\" (; ) is also considered a cognate, which used to mean meat-filled dumplings, but now refers to steamed buns without any filling.\n\n\"Mandu\" can be divided into \"gyoja\" () type and \"poja\" () type. In Chinese, the categories of dumplings are called \"jiǎozi\" (; ) and \"bāozi\" () respectively, which are cognates with the Korean words. In Japanese, the former-type dumplings are called \"gyōza\" (), which is also a cognate. In Mongolian, the latter-type dumplings are called \"buuz\" (), which is also a cognate.\n\n\"Mandu\" are believed to have been first brought to Korea by Yuan Mongolians in the 14th century during the Goryeo Dynasty. The state religion of Goryeo was Buddhism, which discouraged consumption of meat. Mongolian incursion into Goryeo relaxed the religious prohibition against consuming meat, and \"mandu\" was among the newly imported dishes that included meat.\n\nAnother possibility is \"mandu\" came to Korea at a much earlier period from the Middle East through the Silk Road. Historians point out many cuisines based on wheat, such as dumplings and noodles which originated from Mesopotamia and gradually spread from there. It also spread east along the Silk Road, leaving many versions of \"mandu\" throughout Central and East Asia.\n\nA Goryeo era folk song \"Ssanghwajeom\" tells a story of mandu shop (\"ssanghwa\" meaning \"dumplings\", and \"jeom\" meaning \"shop\") run by a foreigner, probably of Central Asian origin.\n\nIf the dumplings are grilled or fried, they are called \"gun-mandu\" (군만두); when steamed, \"jjin-mandu\" (찐만두); and when boiled, \"mul-mandu\" (물만두). In North Korea, mandu styles vary in different regions of the country. In particular, Pulmuone is releasing cheese dumplings, sweet seed dumplings with sugar and spicy dumplings.\n\n\n\"Manduguk\" is a variety of Korean soup (\"guk\") made with \"mandu\" in beef broth. In the Korean royal court, the dish was called \"byeongsi\" () while in Eumsik dimibang, a 17th-century cookbook, it was called \"\"seokryutang\"\" (석류탕).\n\nIn Korean cuisine, \"mandu\" generally denotes a type of filled dumpling similar to the Mongolian \"buuz\" and Turkish \"mantı\", and some variations are similar to the Chinese \"jiaozi\" and the Japanese \"gyoza\". \n\nThey are similar to \"pelmeni\" and \"pierogi\" in some Slavic cultures. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2159626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159626", "title": "Lee Oskar", "text": "Lee Oskar\n\nLee Oskar (born 24 March 1948) is a Danish harmonica player, notable for his contributions to the sound of the rock-funk fusion group War, which was formed by Howard E. Scott and Harold Brown, his solo work, and as a harmonica manufacturer. He continues to play with 3 other original War band members, Harold Brown, Howard Scott and B.B. Dickerson, under the name LowRider Band.\n\nBorn in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1948, Oskar was six years old when a family friend gave him his first harmonica. \"I came from an area where every kid on the block had a harmonica\", he remembers. He grew up listening to Danish radio, enjoying all types of music and cites Ray Charles as the biggest influence from that period. When he was 17, Oskar decided that the United States was where a harmonica player should make his career. So he moved to New York at the age of 18 with little more than a harmonica in his pocket. With no money, Oskar played harmonica in the streets of New York. Eventually arriving in Los Angeles, via Toronto and San Francisco, Oskar soon met and joined forces with Eric Burdon who had recently disbanded The Animals and was searching for new collaborators. Together, the harmonica-playing Dane (born Lee Oskar Levitin) and the British blues-rock singer made the rounds of the L.A. clubs, eventually hooking up with the soon-to-be members of War. Burdon agreed to the novel idea of pairing up Oskar's harmonica with Charles Miller's saxophone to form a horn section. This team-up set War apart from the start, giving Oskar room to display the full spectrum of his improvisational prowess. Oskar's harmonica magic was always a vital element in War's music and performances. Oskar continued with War for 24 years non-stop. At the end of 1992, during the time of dispute over the WAR trademark, Oskar took a few years to continue his solo career and to focus on his Lee Oskar Harmonica manufacturing.\n\nLee Oskar has been described as \"a virtuoso\", \"the harmonica whiz\", \"a war hero\", \"legendary\", a master of \"musical wizardry\", and considered \"...among the best rock-blues-soul harmonica players\". His role as a founding member and former lead harmonica player of the pioneer funk-jazz group War won him international renown for over two and a half decades (1969–1993). Oskar's signature solos helped to define the War sound from the band's beginning in 1969, adding dashes of color to its R&B, jazz, rock, and Latin influences. Oskar's position with War was a prominent one from its early days with singer Eric Burdon onward. \"My playing has become more aggressive over the years\", he says. \"In the beginning, my role was playing horn lines. Today, it's evolved to the point where I'm playing a lead instrument. If I'm not doing a solo, I'm playing counterlines — I try to paint within certain spaces in the music to help create the overall picture.\"\n\nHis biggest worldwide hit was \"Before The Rain\".\n\nThe eclectic, multicultural nature of War's music is also evident in Oskar's solo projects. Three well regarded albums released between 1976 and 1981 (and recently rereleased on CD) brought critical and popular acclaim including being voted No. 1 Instrumental Artist of the Year for 1976 in \"Billboard\", \"Cashbox\" and \"Record World\". The albums, like Oskar's live performances, show the diverse influences of his musicality. A composer, his compositions have been featured on movie sound tracks and television commercials. He has been the recipient of many Gold and Platinum recordings and honored with special ASCAP Writing Awards. \n\nHis music has more recently influenced the song \"Timber\", which was performed by rapper Pitbull and Kesha; which was inspired by Oskar's melodic harmonica playing within his song \"San Francisco Bay\".\n\nIn 1983, Oskar formed a company to manufacture high-quality harmonicas. His company, Lee Oskar Harmonica, sells harmonicas suited to many different styles of music, including the most common blues, folk, rock, R&B and country but Oskar's altered tunings also allows players to explore other genres such as Tango, Clave, Hip Hop, Reggae, Ska, Latin, Gypsy, Yiddish, Eastern European, Asian, and many other types of music. The harmonicas themselves are manufactured by Tombo of Japan. Oskar's harmonica company celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2008 at the NAMM Show. and has now surpassed his 35th anniversary. Lee Oskar harmonicas are praised because of replacement parts which allows changing reed plates when they become fatigued by normal use. This also allows mixing different tunings.\n\nSeveral modern musicians, such as Mike Tetrault, cited Oskar as an important influence. When Junior Wells died, he was buried with a tray of Lee Oskar harmonicas.\n\nOskar lives in Everett, Washington in the United States as of 2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "2159632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159632", "title": "KiMo Theater", "text": "KiMo Theater\n\nThe KiMo Theatre is a theatre and historic landmark located in Albuquerque, New Mexico on the northeast corner of Central Avenue and Fifth Street. It was built in 1927 in the extravagant Art Deco-Pueblo Revival Style architecture, which is a blend of adobe building styles (rounded corners and edges), decorative motifs from indigenous cultures, and the soaring lines and linear repetition found in American Art Deco architecture.\n\nThe KiMo was conceived by Italian-American entrepreneur Oreste Bachechi (c. 1860–1928) and his wife, Maria Franceschi Bachechi (c. 1865–1959). It was Mrs. Bachechi's desire to give a tribute to the Native Americans who had embraced the Bachechi family as part of their own. After much travel and meetings with various architects in both NM and California, the design was accepted from Carl Boller of the Boller Brothers architecture firm, who conducted an extensive investigation into the cultures and building styles of the Southwest before submitting his design. The theater is a three-story stucco building with the stepped massing characteristic of native pueblo architecture, as well as the recessed spandrels and strong vertical thrust of Art Deco skyscrapers. Both the exterior and interior of the building incorporate a variety of indigenous motifs, like the row of terra cotta shields above the third-floor windows.\n\nIn June 1927, the \"Albuquerque Journal\" sponsored a competition to choose a name for the new theater, with a $50 prize for the winner. The rules stipulated that the name \"must be in keeping with this truly American Theatre, whose architecture is a combination of Aztec, Navajo and Pueblo. It must be an Indian name. The name must not have more than six letters.\" Over 500 entries were received from around the state. Pablo Abeita, the former governor of Isleta Pueblo, was chosen as the winner for his suggestion of \"Kimo\", meaning \"mountain lion\" (sometimes loosely translated as \"king of the beasts\"). The second-place entry was \"Eloma\".\n\nThe theater opened on September 19, 1927, with a program including Native American dancers and singers, a performance on the newly installed $18,000 Wurlitzer theater organ, and the comedy film \"Painting the Town\". Dignitaries at the event included Senator Sam G. Bratton, former governor Arthur T. Hannett, and Chairman of the City Commission Clyde Tingley, while Hollywood stars including Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks sent congratulatory telegrams. Cecil B. DeMille wrote, \"The erection of such a theater is definite proof of the great progress being made by this industry of ours.\"\n\nIn 1935, the Bachechi family merged their theater interests with those of Joseph Barnett, including the Sunshine Theater, which put most of Albuquerque's theaters under the same ownership. By 1952, the chain, Albuquerque Exhibitors, controlled 10 local theaters and had 170 employees. The company leased its theaters in 1956 to the Texas-based Frontier Theaters chain, which was taken over by Commonwealth Theaters in 1967. Commonwealth closed the theater in 1970, after which it was leased for a few years by Albuquerque Music Theater and then started showing adult films.\n\nBy 1977, the theater had fallen into disrepair due to a fire. The City of Albuquerque offered to purchase the building at a fraction of its value or condemn it and then demolish it. The family decided that it was best to preserve the theater for future generations and sold the theater to the City of Albuquerque. It has undergone several phases of continuing restoration to return it to its former glory and is once again open to the public for performances. The most recent preservation was completed in 2000 with the installation of new seating and carpet, main stage curtain, new tech booth, lighting positions hid between and behind \"vigas\" on the ceiling, and a re-creation of the KiMo's original proscenium arch. The auditorium seating capacity was 650 at completion of the restoration.\n\nIn 2011, the city commissioned a replica of the theater's original neon sign, which was installed around 1929 and removed sometime in the 1950s. The completed sign, which is tall by wide and cost $16,000, was installed in June 2011.\n\nAccording to local legend, the KiMo Theatre is haunted by the ghost of Bobby Darnall, a six-year-old boy killed in 1951 when a water heater in the theater's lobby exploded. The tale alleges that a theatrical performance of \"A Christmas Carol\" in 1974 was disrupted by the ghost, who was supposedly angry that the staff was ordered to remove donuts they had hung on backstage pipes to appease him.\n\nWhile investigating the legend, writer Benjamin Radford determined that the performance of \"A Christmas Carol\" in question actually occurred in 1986, not 1974, and two people he spoke with who were involved in the production did not remember anything unusual. According to Radford, \"All the evidence points to one inescapable conclusion: The ruined play—the very genesis of the KiMo ghost story—simply did not occur; it is but folklore and fiction\". Radford also contacted Bobby Darnall's siblings, who told him they felt \"exploited by the story\" and did not appreciate \"claims that their beloved brother is eating doughnuts or ruining performances at the KiMo Theater\".\n\n"}

In 2005, NASA was developing the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles, based in part on highly modified Shuttle components, to enable exploration of the Moon and Mars. The agency also studied a third such vehicle, the Ares IV.\n\nSDV concepts are/were proposed even before the Space Shuttle itself began flying.\n\nThe Shuttle-C was a study by NASA to turn the Space Shuttle launch stack into a dedicated uncrewed cargo launcher. The Space Shuttle external tank and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would be combined with a cargo module in place of the shuttle orbiter including the RS-25 engines. Various Shuttle-C concepts were investigated between 1984 and 1995.\n\nThe National Launch System (or New Launch System) was a study authorized in 1991 by President George H. W. Bush to outline alternatives to the Space Shuttle for access to Earth orbit. Shortly thereafter, NASA asked Lockheed Missiles and Space, McDonnell Douglas, and TRW to perform a ten-month study.\n\nA series of launch vehicles was proposed, based around the proposed Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) liquid-fuel rocket engine. The STME was to be a simplified, expendable version of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). The NLS-1 was the largest of three proposed vehicles and would have used a modified Space Shuttle external tank for its core stage. The tank would have fed liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to four STMEs attached to the bottom of the tank. A payload or second stage would have fit atop the core stage, and two detachable Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters would have been mounted on the sides of the core stage as on the Shuttle. Period illustrations suggest that much larger rockets than NLS-1 were contemplated, using multiples of the NLS-1 core stage.\n\nOne of the main goals of Constellation program was the development of spacecraft and booster vehicles to replace the Space Shuttle. NASA had already begun designing two boosters, the Ares I and Ares V, when the program was created. Ares I was designed for the sole purpose of launching mission crews into orbit, while Ares V would have been used to launch other hardware which required a heavier lift capacity than the Ares I booster provided.\n\nAres I was the crew launch vehicle that was being developed by NASA as part of the Constellation program. The name \"Ares\" refers to the Greek deity Ares, who is identified with the Roman god Mars. Ares I was originally known as the \"Crew Launch Vehicle\" (CLV).\n\nNASA planned to use Ares I to launch Orion, the spacecraft intended for NASA human spaceflight missions after the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Ares I was to complement the larger, uncrewed Ares V, which was the cargo launch vehicle for Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, the Constellation program, including Ares I was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage of his 2010 NASA authorization bill.\n\nThe Ares V (formerly known as the Cargo Launch Vehicle or CaLV) was the planned cargo launch component of the cancelled NASA Constellation program, which was to have replaced the Space Shuttle after its retirement in 2011. Ares V was also planned to carry supplies for a human presence on Mars. Ares V and the smaller Ares I were named after Ares, the Greek god of war.\n\nThe Ares V was to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for NASA's return to the Moon, which was planned for 2019. It would also have served as the principal launcher for missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, including the program's ultimate goal, a crewed mission to Mars. The uncrewed Ares V would complement the smaller, and human-rated Ares I rocket for the launching of the 4–6 person Orion spacecraft. Both rockets, deemed safer than the then-current Space Shuttle, would have employed technologies developed for the Apollo program, the Shuttle program, and the Delta IV EELV program. However, the Constellation program, including Ares V was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage of his 2010 NASA authorization bill.\n\nThe Ares IV concept combines an Ares I upper stage on top of an Ares V. Specifically, the vehicle would consist of the liquid-fueled core stage from the Ares V design, two five-segment solid rocket boosters, and the liquid-fueled upper stage from the Ares I, as described by NASA in January 2007. The Ares IV would be a combined tall and could be used to reach the Moon. Total payload capacity would be to for direct trans-lunar injection.\n\nNASA had considered using Ares IV to evaluate high-speed \"skip\" reentry profiles of the Orion capsule in 2007. NASA had planned flight demonstrations of Ares I and Ares V hardware in \"Heavy Lift\" configurations beginning in 2013. The \"Heavy Lift\" test flights were to test the first stage of the Ares V simultaneously with the Ares I upper stage attached on top to save both time and money. The later Heavy Lift test vehicle configurations are similar to the Ares IV vehicle.\n\nAres V Lite was an alternative launch vehicle for NASA's Constellation program suggested by the Augustine Commission. Ares V Lite was a scaled down Ares V. It would have used five RS-68 engines and two five-segment SRBs and have had a low Earth orbit payload of approximately . If chosen, Ares V Lite would have replaced the Ares V and Ares I launchers. One Ares V Lite version would have been a cargo lifter like Ares V and the second version would have carried astronauts in the Orion spacecraft.\n\nThe Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (HLV) was an alternate super heavy-lift launch vehicle proposal for the NASA Constellation program. It was first presented to the Augustine Commission on 17 June 2009.\n\nBased on the Shuttle-C concept which has been the subject of various studies since the 1980s, the HLV was a SDLV that proposed to replace the winged Orbiter from the Space Shuttle stack with a side-mounted payload carrier. The Space Shuttle external tank (ET) and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would have remained the same.\n\nThe Jupiter family of super heavy-lift launch vehicles was part of the proposed DIRECT Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle architecture. It was intended to be the alternative to the Ares I and Ares V rockets.\n\nMajor benefits were projected from re-using as much hardware and facilities from the Space Shuttle program as possible, including cost savings, experience with existing hardware, and preserving the workforce.\n\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) is a US super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle, which is under development as of August 2019. It is the primary launch vehicle of NASA's deep space exploration plans, including the planned crewed lunar flights of the Artemis program and a possible follow-on human mission to Mars.\n\nLiberty was a 2011 launch vehicle concept proposed by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and Astrium for phase 2 of the NASA Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program intended to stimulate development of privately operated crew vehicles to low Earth orbit.\n\nSimilar to the defunct Ares I project, which consisted of a five segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and a new cryogenic second stage, Liberty would combine a five-segment SRB with the core stage of the European Ariane 5 as a second stage.<ref name=\"ATK/Astrium\"></ref>\n\n"}
{"id": "2159644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159644", "title": "Miller", "text": "Miller\n\nA miller is a person who operates a mill, a machine to grind a grain (for example corn or wheat) to make flour. Milling is among the oldest of human occupations. \"Miller\", \"Milne\", and other variants are common surnames, as are their equivalents in other languages around the world (\"Melnyk\" in Russian, Belorussian & Ukrainian languages, \"Meunier\" in French, \"Müller\" or \"Mueller\" in German, \"Mulder\" and \"Molenaar\" in Dutch, \"Molnár\" in Hungarian, \"Molinero\" in Spanish, \"Molinaro\" or \"Molinari\" in Italian etc.). Milling existed in hunter-gatherer communities, and later millers were important to the development of agriculture.\n\nThe materials ground by millers are often foodstuffs and particularly grain. The physical grinding of the food allows for the easier digestion of its nutrients and saves wear on the teeth. Non-food substances needed in a fine, powdered form, such as building materials, may be processed by a miller.\n\nThe most basic tool for a miller was the quern-stone—simply a large, fixed stone as a base and another movable stone operated by hand, similar to a mortar and pestle. As technology and millstones (the bedstone and rynd) improved, more elaborate machines such as watermills and windmills were developed to do the grinding work. These mills harnessed available energy sources including animal, water, wind, and electrical power. Mills are some of the oldest factories in human history, so factories making other items are sometimes known as mills, for example, cotton mills and steel mills. These factory workers are also called millers.\n\nThe rynd in pre-reformation Scotland was often carved on millers' gravestones as a symbol of their trade.\n\nIn a traditional rural society, a miller is often wealthier than ordinary peasants, which can lead to jealousy. Millers are often accused of associating with thieves, and were targeted in bread riots at times of famine. Conversely, millers might be in a stronger position vis-a-vis feudal land owners than are ordinary peasants.\n\nThe traditional carnival held annually in the city of Ivrea, Italy, commemorates a spirited \"Mugnaia\" (miller's daughter) who supposedly refused to let a local duke exercise his right of the first night, and proceeded to chop the duke's head off and spark a revolution. Whatever the historical validity of the story, it is significant it was the daughter of a miller to whom folk tradition assigned this rebellious role.\n\nAs an important part of his job, the miller repeatedly takes into his hand samples of the ground meal coming out of the spout in order to feel the quality and character of the product. The miller rubs the grain between his thumb and forefinger. After years of doing this, the miller's thumb changes shape and becomes broad and flattened. This is known as a \"miller's thumb\".\n\nSayings such as \"worth a millerˈs thumb\" and \"an honest miller hath a golden thumb\" refers to the profit the miller makes as a result of this skill.\n\nThe shape of a miller's thumb is said to have the appearance of the head of a fish. The European bullhead (\"Cottus gobio\"), a freshwater fish, is commonly called a miller's thumb for this reason.\n\n\nMiller (also known as Millar) is a common surname derived from the old English surname \"Milleiir\". The name, and its many other variants, can be found widely across the Europe in countries like the UK, Ireland, and many other countries across the world. \n"}

From his ministry in Rome, he developed and supervised the new village map, completely rebuilding it from 1927 to 1934. Two axes were drawn across the town in order to link the main aspects of everyday life: on the horizontal axis there was the Church (spirituality) and the Balilla House, a youth center, renamed \"Casa della G.I.L\" (\"Gioventù Italiana del Littorio\"); on the vertical axis there was the civic centre (everyday life) and the cemetery (memory).\n\n<BR>\n"}

Founded in February 1991 as the post-communist evolution of the Italian Communist Party, the party was the largest in the Alliance of Progressives and The Olive Tree coalitions. In February 1998, the party merged with minor parties to form Democrats of the Left.\n\nThe PDS evolved from the Italian Communist Party (PCI), the largest communist party in the Western Bloc for most of the Cold War. Since 1948, it had been the second-largest party in Parliament. The PCI moved away from communist orthodoxy in the late 1960s, when it opposed the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s, it was one of the first parties to embrace Eurocommunism. By the late 1980s, the PCI had ties with social-democratic and democratic-socialist parties, and it was increasingly apparent that it was no longer a Marxist–Leninist party. With this in mind, in 1991 the PCI dissolved itself and refounded itself as the PDS. Its first leader was Achille Occhetto, the last secretary of the PCI.\n\nAlthough Ochetto had proclaimed the end of Communism, the new party's logo consisted of an oak tree sprouting from the previous symbol of the PCI in a roundel at the tree's roots. This logo was adopted not only to allow the PDS to trade on the PCI's roots, but to keep any potential splinter party from adopting the old PCI symbol right away. This did not prevent hard-liners leaving the party and launching the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC). In 1993 the PDS was admitted into the Socialist International and Party of European Socialists. In the same year the party's MEPs moved from the European United Left (GUE) to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.\n\nIn the 1994 general election Occhetto was the leader of the Alliance of Progressives coalition, of which the PDS was the largest component. However, he lost to the Pole of Freedoms and Pole of Good Government coalitions led by Silvio Berlusconi, who became Prime Minister for the first time. In the aftermath of the election, Massimo D'Alema was elected new party secretary. In the 1996 general election, after the collapse of Berlusconi's coalition, the PDS was the largest component of the winning The Olive Tree coalition, led by Romano Prodi. It became the largest single party in the legislature, with 146 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 102 in the Senate. The Prodi I Cabinet included 16 PDS ministers and 10 PDS junior ministers–the first time that (former) Communists had taken part in government in half a century. Walter Veltroni, a leading member of the PDS, served as deputy prime minister, while another leading member, Giorgio Napolitano, became interior minister.\n\nIn 1997 D'Alema called for the party to become a full-fledged European social-democratic party. In accordance with this call, the PDS merged in 1998 with the Labour Federation (splinters of the Italian Socialist Party), the Social Christians (including also several former Christian Democrats), the Republican Left (splinters of the Italian Republican Party), the Unitarian Communists (splinters of the Communist Refoundation Party), the Reformists for Europe (mostly former Socialists) and the Democratic Federation (a Sardinian party formed by former Socialists, Democratic Socialists and Republicans) to form Democrats of the Left (DS). On that occasion, the party decided to replace the hammer and sickle of its logo with the red rose of European social democracy.\n\nThe electoral results of PDS in general (Chamber of Deputies) and European Parliament elections from 1992 to 1996 are shown in the chart below.\n\n"}

His parents, William and Betsey (Ellis) Ticknor, were prosperous farmers. His cousin was the famous writer and historian George Ticknor. As a boy, Ticknor worked on the family farm during the summers and attended the district school during the winters. In 1827 at age seventeen he left home and went to Boston.\n\nHe was first employed in the brokerage house of his uncle Benjamin. When his uncle died a few years later he was offered a position at the Columbian Bank, a position he held for a year or two. In 1832 he went into partnership with John Allen forming the publishing house of Allen and Ticknor which operated out of the Old Corner Bookstore. The following year Allen withdrew and Ticknor carried on the house under the name William D. Ticknor and Company, which would remain the legal name of the firm until his death. In 1837 he published the national monthly \"American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge\".\n\nOn December 25, 1832 he had married Emeline Staniford Holt. They had seven children together; only five survived into adulthood. Their three sons Howard Malcom, Benjamin Holt and Thomas Baldwin Ticknor all graduated from Harvard and entered into their father's firm. During the Civil War, Benjamin Holt Ticknor enlisted in the Forty-Fifth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers and was commissioned as second lieutenant of Company G until May 1863. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Second Massachusetts Heavy Artillery. He was later commissioned at captain of Company E and was in command of the recruiting camp at Readville, Massachusetts. He resigned from service shortly after his father's death.\n\nIn 1845 the imprint of the firm was changed to Ticknor, Reed and Fields, after John Reed and James Thomas Fields were admitted as partners. It continued under this imprint until 1854 when John Reed withdrew and the name was changed to the well-known Ticknor and Fields.\nWith the widely varying but well matched talents of the two partners, Ticknor and Fields grew to become one of the leading publishing houses in the 19th century. Ticknor was the first American publisher to pay foreign authors for the rights to their works, beginning with a check to Alfred Tennyson in 1842. From the Old Corner Book Store, Ticknor and Fields published the works of Horatio Alger, Lydia Maria Child, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Tennyson, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain, and John Greenleaf Whittier. The firm also published the \"Atlantic Monthly\", \"Our Young Folks\", and the \"North American Review\". \nDuring his life Ticknor was very involved in the Baptist church, he was a director of the Boston Lyceum, treasurer of the American Institute of Instruction, a trustee of the Perkins Institute, and a leading member of the School Committee. He was also a resident member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society. Shortly after the firm contracted for Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\", Ticknor became a close friend and advisor to Hawthorne.\n\nIn the spring of 1864 Hawthorne's health was failing. Both Ticknor and Sophia Hawthorne insisted on a restorative health trip. During their trip, Ticknor's health suddenly failed. He caught what he assumed was a cold before leaving Boston, and Hawthorne later wrote home that his friend had eaten bad oysters. By the time they reached New York, his illness was determined to be pneumonia. \n\nTicknor was more concerned about Hawthorne, writing to Sophia, \"You will be glad to hear that your patient continues to improve.\" In Philadelphia, the duo visited Fairmount Park and Ticknor offered Hawthorne his jacket for warmth before they returned to the Continental Hotel. Hawthorne wrote to Fields that \"our friend Ticknor is suffering under a billious attack... He had previously seemed uncomfortable, but not to an alarming degree.\" A physician offered various medicines, but Ticknor died on the morning of April 10, 1864. George William Childs arrived shortly after and accompanied the distraught and grieving Hawthorne back to Boston. The sudden loss of Ticknor was devastating to the already failing health of Hawthorne, who would die about a month later on May 19. Ticknor was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery; the distinguished of both literary and business circles came to pay their final tribute.\n\n\n"}

It is located in Olsztyn County and has a predominantly Catholic population of approximately 11,400. The countryside surrounding Biskupiec is a popular tourist destination, part of the Masurian Lake District.\n\nThe town's name derived from the Prince-Bishops of Warmia, who had a castle built in the southeastern outskirts of their realm on the \"Dymer\" creek in the late 14th century. The fortress was first mentioned in a 1389 deed, the settlement that had developed nearby received town privileges according to Kulm law by Bishop Henry III Sorbom in 1395. The town sided with the Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland in 1454. The town and castle were devastated during the subsequent Thirteen Years' War (1454–66) between the rebellious Prussian Confederation and the State of the Teutonic Order, and with Warmia passed to the Lands of the Polish Crown according to the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466.\n\nAgain demolished during the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–21), the Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629) and the Second Northern War (1655–1660), the development of the town was often hampered not only by warfare, but also by blazes, plague and famine. With the First Partition of Poland in 1772, \"Bischofsburg\" was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and a year later incorporated into the newly established Province of East Prussia. The town's population was overwhelmingly Polish. According to the 1797 report of the local priest, of the 200 children attending religious education, only 20 were learning German. From 1862 until 1945, it was the seat of \"Landkreis Rößel\" (Reszel district), from 1871 part of the German Empire. In 1882, in response to the Germanisation attempts of the authorities, a Polish library was established in the town. According to the 1897 data, 75% of children in the district, as well as in the whole southern Warmia region, spoke Polish. After the German defeat in World War I the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite held in the town resulted in 3461 against 52 votes cast for Germany. \"Bischofsburg\" was again 50% destroyed during the East Prussian Offensive of the Red Army in the late days of World War II.\n\nIn 1945 the town was transferred, along with all of Warmia, to Poland according to the resolutions at the Potsdam Conference. Its remaining German population was expelled and the name changed to the historic .\n\nDespite its numerous devastations, the medieval city's layout has been largely preserved. The town's landmark is its 16th century Gothic Church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist (\"Kościół p.w. św. Jana Chrzciciela\"), erected from 1505 onwards on the behest of Prince-Bishop Lucas Watzenrode and consecrated in 1580 by Prince-Bishop Marcin Kromer.\n\n\nBiskupiec is twinned with:\n\n"}

It is a historically working-class, predominantly residential neighbourhood, with a commercial strip located along Wellington Street West. It is home to the Parkdale Farmer's Market, located along Parkdale Avenue, just north of Wellington.\n\nIts eastern border is the O-Train Trillium Line, just west of Preston Street, with Centretown West / Somerset Heights neighbourhood to the east. To the north it is bounded by the transitway (originally the Canadian Pacific Railway main line), along Scott Street, with Mechanicsville beyond. To the south it is bounded by the Queensway (originally the Canadian National Railway main line) (417 Highway) and to the west by Holland Avenue (Hintonburg Community Association borders) or as far west as Island Park Drive. Using the community association's borders, the population of the neighbourhood is 7844 (2016 Census).\n\nHintonburg is very mixed in its character. The land use is mixed, and this is due to its predating land zoning rules. The area has a mix of heritage buildings and recent additions.\n\nIn its April 2007 issue, \"enRoute\" magazine named Hintonburg one of the top ten emerging neighbourhoods in Canada. The same month, Ottawa Magazine said Hintonburg is \"hot\" and credits the QUAD arts district as the reason residents think we're \"cool\". Then in June 2007, the Financial Times noted that the 'Burg is \"thriving again\".\n\nThe area to the north of Wellington Street is very mixed, and is becoming increasingly gentrified. Some industry still exists just south of Scott to the west of Parkdale and along Scott east of Parkdale. The north-east area is almost completely residential, composed primarily of one-hundred-year-old wood 'clapboard' homes, with a small village/enclave nature. Many of the homes are very small, being built by lumber workers in the late 1800s. The area had several lumber mills, 2 as recently as the 1990s - one along Hamilton Avenue and another along Breezehill, both of which were converted to townhouse developments. The area north of Wellington was once considered part of the \"Mechanicsville\" neighbourhood, not Hintonburg, but the expansion of the Transitway and Scott Street have cut off this section from the area to the north.\n\nThe area to the south of Wellington is almost entirely residential of brick-veneer wood-frame construction dating to the 1910 to 1920s. There is very little commercial activity south of Wellington, except for some car repair shops along Gladstone, the Merry Dairy ice cream shop at the intersection of Fairmont and Gladstone Avenues, blumenstudio(a florist/cafe/newspaper shop) on Parkdale Avenue one block south of Gladstone, and along the O-Train Trillium Line to the east, where the Canadian Bank Note Company operates a large facility. There are also some industrial buildings along Breezehill and the Happy Goat Coffee Company, a roastery and cafe at the intersection of Laurel and Loretta North.\n\nTo the west of Holland, in area known as Elmdale the basic pattern of land-use continues. To the south of Wellington, entirely residential. To the north, mainly residential, with smaller homes close to Scott reflecting the time when a railway ran nearby. The road known as Wellington ends here, and continues west as Richmond Road, at one time leading to the village of Richmond. Commercial activity along this street is predominantly independent businesses and offices.\n\nBusinesses on Wellington are characterised by a mixture of largely proprietor-operated retail and service shops. In the east, Wellington has not completely recovered from its being bypassed in the 1960s. Several vacant and/or underutilized properties exist. To the west, Wellington is busier, and commercial activities are thriving due to the proximity of Tunney's Pasture and the Parkdale Market. Bars and restaurants have multiplied, especially along the stretch from Parkdale to Holland. The businesses along Wellington have grouped themselves under the banner of \"Wellington West\" to promote their businesses.\n\nHolland Avenue, a four-lane north-south avenue leading directly south of Tunney's Pasture, has developed a stretch of restaurants and commercial businesses to serve the government complex. At the corner of Holland and Wellington, the Irving Greenberg Theatre Centre was opened in 2007 for live theatre.\n\nParkdale Avenue, a two-lane north-south avenue is a busy road. When the Queensway was built in the 1960s, Parkdale was chosen for an interchange rather than the four-lane Holland Avenue. This leads to daily traffic jams at \"rush hour.\" At its north end, some vestiges of the industrial area along the Scott Street rail line exist and are being converted into artists' space. The popular warm-weather Parkdale Market, a farmers' market, just north of Wellington is the home of about 20 stalls, of local and imported produce and flowers. To the south of Wellington, it is residential on both sides.\n\nHintonburg is home to the \"QUAD\". The QUAD, an acronym that stands for Quartier des artistes / Arts District, blends cultural expression, community spirit and heritage character to create a special neighbourhood that embraces all arts disciplines, was established in 2003. Several galleries have opened since 2006 in the vicinity of the Parkdale Market.\n\nIn 2005, the Hintonburg community Association (HCA) launched the ArtsPark annual event in the Parkdale Market featuring the works of Ottawa artists and musicians to highlight the community's growing role as an arts district in the city. Regular activities are put on at the Hintonburg Community Centre, including outdoor films in the summer.\n\nHintonburg is the long-time home of the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, located on Fairmont Avenue. The Society produces several musical productions every year. The productions are mounted at the Centrepointe Theatre in Nepean.\n\nIn 2007 the Great Canadian Theatre Company (GCTC) relocated to Hintonburg, in a new theatre built at Holland and Wellington. GCTC produces original Canadian plays.\n\nHintonburg features a few old churches. Including Saint-François d'Assise parish. It was established in 1890 by members of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, refugees from compulsory military service in France, with the construction of a church, school, and monastery (since demolished). In 1902, the buildings, together with an apple orchard, were enclosed by a stone wall the remnants of which today enclose Hintonburg Park. In 1913, the present larger gothic church was built to accommodate the growing parish, reflecting the strong Francophone character of Hintonburg at this time. Today this impressive edifice dominates the neighbourhood and its bells toll the Angelus at noon and 6:00 p.m., as well as a call to Mass (liturgy).\n\nOriginally part of Nepean Township the area was first settled in 1826, growing in size the village of Hintonburg was incorporated as a village in 1893. It was named after Joseph Hinton, a community leader who died in 1884. As the city of Ottawa grew it expanded west and Hintonburg was annexed to Ottawa in 1907. The Ahearne's Ottawa Street Railway Company ran a street car line through the area, continuing along further west along Byron Avenue (now a recreational path) and it soon became home to mostly blue collar workers who commuted into downtown.\n\nHintonburg used to be on the main road leading west from downtown Ottawa. Wellington Street, which starts at Parliament Hill, runs through the center of the neighbourhood to this day. Originally, the area north of Wellington was considered Mechanicsville, but over time this has changed. When the NCC took over Lebreton Flats in the 1960s, the bridge over the north-south rail line linking the central Wellington street to the Hintonburg section was demolished, and the central Wellington street was linked to Scott street, making a bypass for the automobile traffic. This led to a decline in commercial business along Wellington Street which with gentrification has been reversed. At one time, there was a department store at the crossroads of Somerset and Wellington. By the 1970s it had become the main office of the used goods charity \"Ottawa Neighbourhood Services\" which had to move when it was bought out in 2001 and the buyer broke his verbal contract with ONS several months following the sale. The building was then converted to commercial use, with offices and a carpet store, but which have now houses an LCBO branch and a fabrications store.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s was a time of great change in the area. The federal government built the Tunney's Pasture office campus at the north end of Holland Avenue. The rail line along Scott Street was closed and eventually became the Transitway bus roadway. To the south, the Queensway/417 was built, partly on old rail lines, and partly directly through demolition of homes along its path. This provided another bypass around the area, and also lead to an increase of automobile traffic along Parkdale.\n\nWhen a major effort to remove prostitutes from the Byward Market area was made in the early 1990s, the strip along Wellington at Somerset became an area of \"streetwalkers.\" One notorious bar, named \"Grads\", located at Somerset and Bronson, burned down. It moved to Bayswater and Somerset, bringing its clientele, which used drugs. One incident outside its premises, where a man was beaten to death, led to its closure. By then the surrounding area had become known for its prostitutes, something which was only eradicated through regular crackdowns. The local Community Association worked with police and other city agencies to step up enforcement efforts against drug houses in an effort to reduce prostitution- and drug-related challenges. In one controversial development, residents had targeted \"johns\" by tracking and publishing partial licence plates. The Ottawa-Carleton Police set up a 'john school' whereby first-time offenders could attend instead of paying a fine and learn the effects of their trade. Community efforts were recognized with an award in 2009 for helping transform Hintonburg into a place with one of the lowest calls for police services in Ottawa.\n\nThe area continues to change. In the late 1980s, the Hintonburg Community Association (HCA) was formed, and the local residents now have a better voice in community issues and local City of Ottawa activities. The Hintonburg Community/Recreation Centre was opened, and several in-fill developments have occurred. Several of the older industrial buildings and cottages have become space to artists. The area is adapting to a new role, that of central-area residential neighbourhood, and is comparable to others in Ottawa.\n\nIn 2003, HCA published \"Hintonburg & Mechanicsville: A Narrative History\" by John Leaning, (); it is available in some local bookshops and through the association. A heritage walking tour of the neighbourhood is also available on their website (see link below).\n\nIn 2005, the Parkdale Fire Station, built in 1923, was renovated into commercial space. It had served as a fire hall until 1986. It then housed a food bank and artists' studios. It was named a heritage building in 1996. It is one of only four pre-1945 fire stations left in Ottawa, 1 on Bruyère St. built in 1896, 1 on Arthur St. built in 1913. and another on Sunnyside Dr. built in 1921. Its renovation was one of the first and one of the last projects funded under federal heritage building restoration funds.\n\n\nHintonburg is accessible via the Pimisi station and Bayview station on the O-Train, and by the Route 11 and 14 buses, which runs along Wellington/Somerset and Gladstone for the neighbourhood's full length. The Parkdale exit provides car access from the Queensway. Bicycle lanes are available along Wellington, but they are not physically separated from car lanes.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \n\n"}

It is used to prevent leakage of fluid, such as water or steam, between sliding or turning parts of machine elements.\n\nA stuffing box of a sailboat will have a stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing and put in the gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.\n\nA gland is a general type of stuffing box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in the head of a tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the piston rod of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.\n\nOther types of sealed connections without moving parts are also sometimes called glands; for example, a cable gland or fitting that connects a flexible electrical conduit to an enclosure, machine or bulkhead facilitates assembly and prevents liquid or gas ingress.\n\nOn a boat having an inboard motor that turns a shaft attached to an external propeller, the shaft passes through a stuffing box, also called a \"packing box\" or \"stern gland\" in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water from entering the boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The \"box\" is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the stern tube and the aft portion of the stuffing box sleeve. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.\n\nIn a common type of stuffing box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of flax or hemp impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the adjusting nut compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just enough to make the seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.\n\nThere are improved shaft packing materials that aim to be drip-less when the shaft is turning as well as when stationary, also pack-less sealing systems that employ engineered materials such as carbon composites and PTFE (e.g. Teflon).\n\nIn a steam engine, where the piston rod reciprocates through the cylinder cover, a stuffing box provided in the cylinder cover prevents the leakage of steam from the cylinder.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2159714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159714", "title": "Saturation (magnetic)", "text": "Saturation (magnetic)\n\nSeen in some magnetic materials, saturation is the state reached when an increase in applied external magnetic field \"H\" cannot increase the magnetization of the material further, so the total magnetic flux density \"B\" more or less levels off. (It continues to increase very slowly due to the vacuum permeability.) Saturation is a characteristic of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, such as iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys.\n\nSaturation is most clearly seen in the \"magnetization curve\" (also called \"BH\" curve or hysteresis curve) of a substance, as a bending to the right of the curve (see graph at right). As the \"H\" field increases, the \"B\" field approaches a maximum value asymptotically, the saturation level for the substance. Technically, above saturation, the \"B\" field continues increasing, but at the paramagnetic rate, which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the ferromagnetic rate seen below saturation.\n\nThe relation between the magnetizing field \"H\" and the magnetic field \"B\" can also be expressed as the magnetic permeability: formula_1 or the \"relative permeability\" formula_2, where formula_3 is the vacuum permeability. The permeability of ferromagnetic materials is not constant, but depends on \"H\". In saturable materials the relative permeability increases with \"H\" to a maximum, then as it approaches saturation inverts and decreases toward one.\n\nDifferent materials have different saturation levels. For example, high permeability iron alloys used in transformers reach magnetic saturation at 1.6–2.2teslas (T), whereas ferrites saturate at 0.2–0.5T. Some amorphous alloys saturate at 1.2–1.3T. Mu-metal saturates at around 0.8T.\n\nFerromagnetic materials (like iron) are composed of microscopic regions called magnetic domains, that act like tiny permanent magnets that can change their direction of magnetization. Before an external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domains' magnetic fields are oriented in random directions, effectively cancelling each other out, so the net external magnetic field is negligibly small. When an external magnetizing field \"H\" is applied to the material, it penetrates the material and aligns the domains, causing their tiny magnetic fields to turn and align parallel to the external field, adding together to create a large magnetic field \"B\" which extends out from the material. This is called magnetization. The stronger the external magnetic field \"H\", the more the domains align, yielding a higher magnetic flux density \"B\". Eventually, at a certain external magnetic field, the domain walls have moved as far as they can, and the domains are as aligned as the crystal structure allows them to be, so there is negligible change in the domain structure on increasing the external magnetic field above this. The magnetization remains nearly constant, and is said to have saturated. The domain structure at saturation depends on the temperature.\n\nSaturation puts a practical limit on the maximum magnetic fields achievable in ferromagnetic-core electromagnets and transformers of around 2 T, which puts a limit on the minimum size of their cores. This is one reason why high power motors, generators, and utility transformers are physically large; to conduct the large amounts of magnetic flux necessary for high power production, they must have large magnetic cores.\n\nIn electronic circuits, transformers and inductors with ferromagnetic cores operate nonlinearly when the current through them is large enough to drive their core materials into saturation. This means that their inductance and other properties vary with changes in drive current. In linear circuits this is usually considered an unwanted departure from ideal behavior. When AC signals are applied, this nonlinearity can cause the generation of harmonics and intermodulation distortion. To prevent this, the level of signals applied to iron core inductors must be limited so they don't saturate. To lower its effects, an air gap is created in some kinds of transformer cores. The \"saturation current\", the current through the winding required to saturate the magnetic core, is given by manufacturers in the specifications for many inductors and transformers. \nOn the other hand, saturation is exploited in some electronic devices. Saturation is employed to limit current in \"saturable-core transformers\", used in arc welding, and ferroresonant transformers which serve as voltage regulators. When the primary current exceeds a certain value, the core is pushed into its saturation region, limiting further increases in secondary current. In a more sophisticated application, saturable core inductors and magnetic amplifiers use a DC current through a separate winding to control an inductor's impedance. Varying the current in the control winding moves the operating point up and down in the saturation curve, controlling the Alternating Current through the inductor. These are used in variable fluorescent light ballasts, and power control systems.\n\nSaturation is also exploited in fluxgate magnetometers and fluxgate compasses. \n"}
{"id": "2159716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159716", "title": "Confey College", "text": "Confey College\n\nConfey College is a co-educational interdenominational vocational school in Leixlip, County Kildare, Republic of Ireland. The school opened to 36 students in September 1986 and has approximately 750 students at present and about 50 staff members.\n\nThe school is situated at the end of the River Forest Estate. It is one of two secondary-level schools in Leixlip, the other being Coláiste Chiaráin.\n\nBefore the construction of the original school building in Riverforest in 1994, Confey College teachers taught in nearby Scoil San Carlo on a part-time basis after the primary school closed for the day at 3 pm. After lobbying from teachers and parents, prefabricated buildings were provided on the site which the school currently occupies. With the growth of Leixlip and an expanding teenage population, these facilities were inadequate. With much further teacher and local pressure, what is now the older of the two school buildings was built in 1994, with three prefabs remaining in use as classrooms. The remaining prefabs were removed in 2001 with the construction of a new, larger building.\n\nIn February 2011, Mary McAleese made a presidential visit to the school in honour of its 25-year anniversary.\n\nThe school produces annual musical productions. Past shows include \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\", \"Grease\", \"Back to the 80's\", \"Sinbad\", \"Cinderella\" and \"Treasure Island\". The musical productions were halted in 2014 and instead replaced by a talent competition named 'Show Stoppers!'. But in 2015 the TY group put on a musical \"Little Shop Of Horrors\". The Transition Year group of 2016-17 displayed the musical \"Hairspray'd\". In December 2018, the Transition Year group of 2018-19 performed the musical \"FAME JR\".\n\nThe transition year group of 2019-2020 performed the musical \"All Shook Up\" from 11-13 December 2019.\n\nConfey College has a Green-Schools committee made up of students and teachers. The committee started in 2009 and has conducted surveys, worked with a local Councillor on cleanup days and has plans to make a garden to mark the school's 25th birthday. The school was awarded its first green flag in 2013 and its second flag in 2014. The committee is currently working on gaining the school's third flag.\n\nConfey College have an all-weather 'astro turf' pitch. The pitches are used for school teams as well as PE.\n\nIn hurling, Confey College secured the Senior Leinster 'C1' Championship in 2010, defeating St. Vincent's C.B.S. 3-11 to 0–2.\n\nIn 2010, Confey College's futsal team won the Kildare & Leinster Post Primary Schools Futsal title.

{"id": "2159719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159719", "title": "Khalq", "text": "Khalq\n\nKhalq (, meaning \"Masses\" or \"People\") was a faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). Its historical leaders were Presidents Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafizullah Amin. It was also the name of the leftist newspaper produced by the same movement. It was supported by the USSR and was formed in 1965 when the PDPA was born. The Khalqist wing of the party was made up primarily of Pashtuns from non-elite classes. However, their Marxism was often a vehicle for tribal resentments. Bitter resentment between the Khalq and Parcham factions eventually led to the failure of the government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan that was formed as a result of the Saur Revolution in 1978. It was also responsible for the radical reforms and brutal dissident crackdowns that encouraged the rebellion of the religious segments present in the Afghan society, which led to the creation of the Mujahideen and, eventually, to the Soviet military intervention in December 1979.\n\nThe People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan held its First Congress on January 1, 1965. Twenty-seven men gathered at Nur Mohammed Taraki's house in Kabul, elected Taraki PDPA Secretary General, Babrak Karmal as Deputy Secretary General, and chose a five-member Central Committee(or Politburo).\n\nFinally, Hafizullah Amin was the only Khalqi member of the PDPA to be elected to Parliament in 1969.\n\nThe party was weakened by bitter, and sometimes violent, internal rivalries. The Khalq faction was more tribal, whereas the Parcham had more support among the urban population and middle classes. Especially on the ideological level, Karmal and Taraki differed in their perceptions of Afghanistan's revolutionary potential:\n\nThe newspaper was highly successful, especially among students. Its first edition sold 20,000 copies, and later editions numbered around 10,000 (there were only six editions altogether). On May 23, 1966, the authorities closed Khalq on the grounds that it was anti-Islamic, anticonstitutional, and antimonarchical. Karmal's faction founded Parcham, a weekly magazine that he published between March 1968 and July 1969. Parcham was shut down in June 1969 on the eve of parliamentary elections.\n\nKhalq was excluded from the new government because of its lack of good political connections and its go-it-alone policy on noncooperation. Taraki did advocate a united front briefly after former Prime Minister Mohammad Daoud Khan's takeover in an attempt to gain places in the government for his followers, but this effort was unsuccessful. The Khalqis claimed to be more leftist and more independent of the Soviet Union than Parcham, but their base of support was not strong among the masses, and much stronger in the military. Because of this, Khalq abandoned his party's traditional emphasis on working-class recruitment and sought to build his own power base within the officer corps. Khalq's influence at Kabul University was also limited.\n\nIn 1973 the Khalq faction energetically began to encourage military personnel to join them. Taraki had been in charge of Khalq activity in the military. In 1973 he passed his recruitment duties to Amin. This move was highly successful: by the time of the communist coup, in April 1978, Khalq outnumbered Parcham by a factor of two or three to one. The Moscow-sponsored union of Parcham and Khalq may have been in preparation for his peaceful passage from the scene in the near future. The merger of Parcham and Khalq rapidly became unglued. However, Mir Akbar Khyber, a prominent leftist, was killed by the government and his associates. Although the government issued a statement deploring the assassination, the PDPA leaders feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all. In this way, both Khalq and Parcham forgot their internal rivalries and worked to overthrow the government.\n\nOn the eve of the communist coup, Hafizullah Amin was the only member of the Central Committee that was not arrested. The police did not send him to immediate imprisonment, as it did with Politburo members of the PDPA on April 25, 1978. He was the last person to be arrested, his imprisonment was postponed for five hours, during which time Amin, without having the authority and while the Politburo members were in prison, instructed the Khalqi army officers to overthrow the government.\n\nThe Khalqist Army cells prepared for a massive uprising. On April 27 the Khalqist military leaders began the revolution by proclaiming to the cells in the armed forces that the time for revolution had arrived. Khalqist Colonel Mohammad Aslam Watanjar was the Army commander on the ground during the Coup, and his troops gained control of Kabul. Colonel Abdul Qadir, the leader of the Air Force squadrons, also launched a major attack on the Royal Palace, in the course of which President Mohammad Daoud Khan and most of his family, including women and children, were assassinated.\n\nThe Saur Revolution, as the new government labeled its coup d'état (after the month in the Persian calendar in which it occurred), was almost entirely the achievement of the Khalq faction of the PDPA. Khalq's victory was partially due to Daoud's miscalculation that Parcham was the more serious threat. This success gave it effective control over the armed forces, a great advantage over its Parchami rival. During the first months of the revolution, Cabinet membership was split eleven to ten, with Khalq in the majority.\n\nHowever, the initial, moderate, approach to Islam taken by the PDPA was quickly abandoned as the Khalqists sought to consolidate their hold on power. Khalq dominated the Revolutionary Council, which was to serve as the ruling body of the government. The Khalq leadership ran the country by issuing a series of eight edicts. They suspended all laws except those on civil matters. Another exception was the criminal law of the Daoud period, retained as a repressive instrument. They also embarked on a campaign of radical land reform accompanied by mass repression in the countryside that resulted in the arrest and summary execution of tens of thousands. The Khalqi policy of encouraging the education of girls, for example, aroused deep resentment in the villages. By putting Afghanistan on the revolutionary road, the Khalq wing of the PDPA stirred the countryside into revolt.\n\nPresident Nur Mohammad Taraki refused to tolerate any Parchamis in the military and insisted that all officers affiliate with Khalq. By June 1978 an estimated 800 Parchami military personnel were forced to quit the armed forces. Shortly after, the Khalqist wing in the Army, initiated a purge of Parchamis. They accomplished this performing the elimination of the opposition and removal of any restraints posed by the Parchamis. Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister in March 1979, retaining the position of field marshal and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army, though now he reportedly devoted a lot of his time at the Royal Palace, which had been renamed the People's Palace. Events also tended to sub-divide the protagonists. The intense rivalry between Taraki and Amin within the Khalq faction heated up. In September 1979, Taraki's followers, with Soviet complicity, had made several attempts on Amin's life. The final attempt backfired. Amin's murder of Taraki divided the Khalqis. Rival military cliques divided the Khalqis further.\n\nIn late October, Amin made a military sweep against the insurgents, victoriously driving 40,000 people – mostly non-combatants – across the border into Pakistan. At the end of 1979 there were 400,000 Afghan refugees, mostly in Pakistan. The USSR attempted to temper the Khalqis' radicalism, urging attendance at mosques, inclusion of Parchamis and non-communists in the government, and a halt to the unpopular land reform movement. Most of this advice was ignored. The last Khalq President, Hafizullah Amin, was assassinated after Soviet intelligence forces took control of the government and installed Babrak Karmal, a Parchami, in his place.\n\nKhalqi-Parchami differences began to rend the military as Khalqi leaders, fearful that the Parchamis retained their cellular organization within the military, mounted massive purges of Parchamis. Thanks to Amin's efforts in the 1970s, the officer corps consisted largely of Khalqis. The Army was also not immune to antigovernment sentiment. Soldiers began to desert and mutiny. Herat was the site of an uprising in March 1979 in which a portion of the town's military garrison joined. The rebels butchered Soviet citizens as well as Khalqis.\n\nThe purging of Parchamis had left the military forces so dominated by Khalqis that the Soviets had no choice but to rely upon Khalqi officers to rebuild the army. Khalq officers and men expressed bitterness over the preferential treatment given their Parcham rivals by the Parcham dominated regime. Disaffected Khalqis often assisted the Mujahideen. Khalqis in the armed forces often accused their Parchami officers of using them as cannon fodder and complained that young Parchami men were exempted from compulsory military service. A show of this was that, in 1980, at the April military parade celebrating the Saur Revolution, many Tank Corps continued to display the Red Flag of Khalq, instead of the new national flag adopted by Babrak Karmal.\n\nAfter the 40th Soviet Army left the country, President Najibullah suffered, to a lesser degree, the same disadvantage that Karmal had when he was installed as General Secretary of the PDPA by the Soviets. This fact was shown by the fierceness of the resistance to Najibullah's appointment within the Parcham faction. This split persisted, forcing President Najibullah to straddle his politics between whatever Parchami support he could maintain and alliances he could win from the Khalqists.\n\nIn December 1989, 127 Khalqist military officers were arrested for an attempted coup. Twenty-seven officers escaped and later showed up at a press conference with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in Peshawar. Former Minister of Tribal Affairs, Bacha Gul Wafadar and Minister of Civil Aviation Hasan Sharq were among the conspirators. In March 1990, once again the Mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar cooperated in a coup attempt, this time led by the Khalqist Defense minister Shahnawaz Tanai. Tanai was apparently also supported by those important Khalqist who remained in the Politburo, Assadullah Sarwary and Mohammad Gulabzoi, respectively their country's envoys to Aden and Moscow. They were said to have been intimately connected with the coup and with Gen. Tanai. However, Tanai had no direct control of troops inside Kabul. The plot misfired and failed because of faulty communications.\n\nAt the end, however, the former Khalqists either joined or allied themselves with the Taliban or other Mujahideen warlords after the collapse of President Najibullah's Government in April, 1992. A perfect example of this was that, once Kabul was captured, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar gained the support of some Khalqi (and mostly Pashto) hardliners, including the Minister of Internal Affairs Raz Mohammad Paktin and then Defence Minister Mohammad Aslam Watanjar. Another example of this is the fact that Gen. Tanai has (according to western diplomatic sources) acted as an agent for ISI by providing the Taliban a skilled cadre of military officers.\n\nIn this way, the Khalqi faction were once again involved in the war, using his pilots to fly the Mig-23 and Sukhoi fighters of what was left of the Afghan Air Force, driving Soviet Tanks and using Soviet Artillery. With no central government and fighting for different groups, Khalq was merely a pawn in the Afghan Civil War between the Afghan Northern Alliance and the Taliban.\n\nOther Khalqists have developed fairly close relations with the current regime, after the defeat of the Taliban and the ascendance of Hamid Karzai in 2002.\n\n\n"}

A center, Collins played college basketball for Stanford University, where he was an All-American in 2000–01. Collins was selected by the Houston Rockets as the 18th overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft. He went on to play for the New Jersey Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Washington Wizards and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAfter the 2012–13 NBA season concluded, Collins publicly came out as gay. He became a free agent and did not play again until February 2014, when he signed with the Nets and became the first openly gay athlete to play in any of four major North American pro sports leagues. In April 2014, Collins was featured on the cover of \"Time Magazine's\" \"100 Most Influential People in the World\".\n\nCollins was born in Northridge, California. He was born eight minutes ahead of his twin brother Jarron, who also became an NBA player.\n\nThey graduated from Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. He and Jarron won two California Interscholastic Federation state titles during their four-year careers with a combined record of 123–10. Collins broke the California career rebounding record with 1,500. Collins was backed up by Jason Segel, who \"USA Today\" opined might have ended up being the most famous player from the team.\n\nCollins played with brother Jarron for the Stanford Cardinal in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10). In 2001, Collins was named to All-Pac-10 first team, and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) voted him to their third-team All-American team.\n\nHe finished his college career ranked first in Stanford history for field goal percentage (.608) and third in blocked shots (89).\n\nAs a rookie along with Richard Jefferson, Collins played a significant role in the New Jersey Nets' first-ever NBA Finals berth in 2002 against the Los Angeles Lakers. During this Finals appearance, Collins acknowledged that he is not really 7 feet tall as he has been listed since his junior year of college. He was measured 6 ft 10¼ in at the 2001 NBA combine.\n\nIn the 2002–03 NBA season Collins took over the starting center role for the Nets and helped the franchise back to the NBA Finals. During that season, Collins averaged 5.7 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. Prior to the 2004–05 season, he signed a $25 million contract extension with New Jersey for five more years.\n\nOn February 4, 2008, Collins was traded along with cash considerations to the Memphis Grizzlies for Stromile Swift.\n\nOn June 26, 2008, Collins was dealt to the Minnesota Timberwolves in an eight-player deal involving Kevin Love and O. J. Mayo.\n\nCollins signed with the Atlanta Hawks on September 2, 2009. Collins re-signed with the Hawks in the 2010 offseason. In 2010–11, the fifth-seeded Hawks defeated the fourth-seeded Orlando Magic as Collins slowed the Magic's dominant center, Dwight Howard. After Game 4 in the series, then-Orlando coach Stan Van Gundy called Collins' play \"the best defense on [Howard] all year\".\nOn July 31, 2012, Collins signed a contract with the Boston Celtics. On February 21, 2013, Collins and Leandro Barbosa were traded to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Jordan Crawford.\n\nOn April 29, 2013, after the season had already concluded, Collins publicly came out as gay, becoming the first active male athlete from one of the four major North American professional team sports to publicly do so. Collins became a free agent in July 2013, and stated that he intended to pursue another contract. He was not invited by any team to training camp, but he worked out at his home waiting for an opportunity.\n\nOn February 23, 2014, Collins signed a 10-day contract to rejoin the Nets, who had since moved to Brooklyn. Nets coach Jason Kidd, who became good friends with Collins while teammates in New Jersey from 2001 to 2008, was an advocate of signing Collins. Collins played 11 minutes that night against the Lakers at the Staples Center, becoming the first publicly gay athlete to play in any of the four major North American professional sports leagues. Collins wore jersey number 46 (the only number the team had available at the time) in his first game of the season, but planned to wear No. 98—the same number he wore with Boston and Washington—going forward. Collins chose to wear No. 98 in honor of Matthew Shepard, whose 1998 murder was widely reported as a hate crime and ultimately led to the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Collins' jersey rose to the top spot for sales in the NBA's online shop, and the NBA announced that proceeds from the sales, as well as proceeds from auctions of Collins' autographed game-worn jerseys, would benefit the Matthew Shepard Foundation, and the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN).\nOn March 5, 2014, Collins signed a second 10-day contract with the Nets. On March 15, 2014, Collins signed with the Nets for the rest of the season.\n\nOn November 19, 2014, Collins announced his retirement from professional basketball after 13 seasons in the NBA.\n\nCollins had low career averages in the NBA of 3.6 points, 3.7 rebounds, 0.5 blocks, and 41 percent shooting from the field, and never averaged more than seven points or seven rebounds in a season. However, the basketball analytics community valued his defense through measurements not typically found in a boxscore. Collins was a physical player defending the post, boxed out well, and excelled at setting screens. He was precise in executing coaches' defensive strategies, and he read the opponents' movements well and communicated on defense. He also had a reputation for being a team leader, and earned consistent praise for his professionalism and intelligence on the court.\n\nCollins was in an eight-year relationship with former WNBA center Carolyn Moos, and the two were engaged to be married, but Collins called off the wedding in 2009.\n\nIn the cover story of the May 6, 2013 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", a first person story by Collins with journalist Franz Lidz, and posted on the magazine's website on April 29, 2013, he came out as gay, becoming the first active male athlete from one of the four major North American professional team sports to publicly do so. He wrote that he wished to maintain his privacy in regard to specific details of his personal life, and that he is not in a relationship. Collins also said a \"notorious antigay hate crime\", the murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998, led him to choose \"98\" for his jersey number, in Shepard's honor. Collins called the number \"a statement to myself, my family and my friends.\"\n\nFollowing his announcement, Collins has received high praise and support for deciding to publicly reveal that he is gay. Fellow NBA star Kobe Bryant praised his decision, as did others from around the league, including NBA commissioner David Stern. President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, former president Bill Clinton, and Collins' corporate sponsor Nike were also among those offering their praise and support for Collins. However, ESPN basketball analyst Chris Broussard stated that he did not believe that Collins can \"live an openly homosexual lifestyle\" and be a Christian, but thought that Collins \"displayed bravery with his announcement\". Collins, a Christian, responded by saying \"This is all about tolerance and acceptance and America is the best country in the world because we're all entitled to our opinions and beliefs but we don't have to agree. And obviously I don't agree with his statement.\" \"The Guardian\" called it significant for LGBT acceptance \"as professional sports had long been seen as the final frontier.\" Given the interest in major league team sports in the United States, the \"Christian Science Monitor\" wrote that Collins' announcement was \"likely to put wind in the sails of this trend\" of acceptance of gay rights in U.S. public opinion. Former tennis player Martina Navratilova, who came out as a lesbian in 1981, called Collins a \"game-changer\" for team sports, which she referred to as one of the last areas where homophobia remained.\n\nCollins' former fiancée, Carolyn Moos, expressed conflicted feelings and said she only learned Collins was gay shortly before the \"Sports Illustrated\" cover story.\n\nOn the day it was released, the \"Sports Illustrated\" story drew a record 3.7 million visitors to the magazine's website, SI.com.\n\n\"The New York Times\" called his 2014 signing with Brooklyn \"perhaps basketball’s most celebrated and scrutinized 10-day contract.\" His No. 98 jersey became the top seller on the NBA's online store.\n\nAs of June 2014, Collins was in a relationship with producer Brunson Green.\n\nOn August 2, 2013, Collins was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

McGowan of the \"Ancient and Honorable Order of Turtles\", his father, the late Captain Hugh P. McGowan, U.S. Army Air Corps/U.S. Air Force Reserve (Ret.) and several pilots of the U.S. Army Air Corps 8th Air Force founded the Ancient and Honorable Order of Turtles in an officers' club while stationed in England during the Second World War: \"We were flying daytime bombing missions over Hitler's Third Reich. We just wanted a little fun. We had seen a sign showing that the 'Ancient Order of Foresters' and the 'Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes' would meet in the local pub, so I devised the name 'Ancient and Honorable Order of Turtles' for the fun of it. It was not meant to be serious, it had no constitution or by-laws, and was a relief from the horrors and dangers we saw every day on our missions. It spread after the War through the VFW and American Legion posts, and eventually, to Masonic groups, colleges and even to the high schools of the U.S.A.\"\n\nTo gain admission, one must correctly answer a number (usually three or four) from a list of questions, each of which suggests a vulgar, lewd, or salacious answer, but the actual correct answer is rather innocuous. It is assumed that all prospective Turtles own a diabetic donkey, or one of a sweet and kindly disposition; therefore once inducted, a member must reply to the question \"Are you a Turtle?\" with \"You bet your sweet ass I am.\" If the member is unable or unwilling (perhaps because of a social restriction on vulgarity) to provide the correct answer, he or she owes to each other turtle present a drink of the recipient's choice.\nA large part of the tradition of the order involves the qualifying questions that prospective members have to answer. These fun questions are actually small riddles: each suggests a vulgar or lewd answer, but the candidate has to provide a completely innocuous answer.\n\nA popular example would be the question:\n\nThe obvious answer to this question would be \"pee\" or \"urinate\", but the correct answer is \"shake hands\" (as western etiquette demands that a man needs to rise from his seat to shake hands, while a woman needs not).\n\nA candidate must answer four from a list of twenty-five of such questions. While there is a traditional set of questions, some modern clubs also make up new initiation questions along the same lines.\n\nDuring the Mercury-Atlas 8 mission (part of the United States space program), astronaut Wally Schirra was asked by a ground controller whether he was a turtle. Not wanting to use vulgar language while his communications were being broadcast worldwide, he temporarily stopped transmitting while he gave the required response \"YBYSAIA\".\n\nDeke Slayton, a mere three minutes into \"Sigma 7\"s flight, came on the radio, which was open for everyone to hear, and asked, \"Hey, Wally, are you a turtle?\" Schirra switched his mic from live to record and uttered the appropriate response. On the open line, he said, \"Rog.\"\n\nLater, on board the recovery ship , in front of Slayton, Walt Williams and the other astronauts, Walt Williams demanded to know how Schirra replied to Deke's question. Schirra played the recorder. \"Hey, Wally, are you a turtle?\" followed by the proper response, \"YBYSAIA\". This incident is also recounted in Tom Wolfe's book \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nWally Schirra's membership in the Ancient Order of Turtles came up again during Apollo 7, which was captured by the in-flight recorder:\n\nPresident Kennedy was allegedly asked if he was a Turtle at a press conference, to which he replied, \"I'll buy you your drink later.\"\n\n\n"}

Slumgum is slightly heavier than wax and sticks to the bottom of the wax cake. It is brown to black in color, and burns readily. Melted slumgum can be poured over pine cones to make fire starters.\n\nLumps of slumgum are very attractive to bees, especially when heated by the sun. They can be used to attract bee swarms, and some people therefore prefer applying melted slumgum on the sides of supers.\n\nSlumgum is also used as a fertilizer in some agricultural crops like ornamentals; it has been shown that slumgum contains several nutrients that are required for the growth of these crops.\n\nDepending on how well the rendering was performed, slumgum may still contain significant amount of wax that is possible to extract in larger factories using more complex equipment.\n"}
{"id": "2159758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159758", "title": "Kamo Shrine", "text": "Kamo Shrine\n\nThe Kamo Shrine encompasses what are now independent but traditionally associated \"jinja\" or shrines: the in Kyoto's Kita Ward, and the in Sakyo Ward. They are amongst the \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto\" which have been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe \"jinja\" name identifies the clustered \"kami\" or deities who are venerated at the Kamo Shrine; and the name refers to the ambit of shrine's encircling woods. The shrine name also references the area's early inhabitants, the Kamo clan, many of whom continue to live near the shrine their ancestors traditionally served. The Kamo are credited with establishing this Shinto sacred place.\n\nThe formal names of corollary \"jinja\" memorialize vital roots in a history which pre-dates the founding of Japan's ancient capital. Although now incorporated within boundaries of the city, the \"Tadasu no Mori\" location was a site planning factor. It is theorized that this forest was the primeval forest home of the sacerdotal Kamo clan, who were the exclusive caretakers of the shrine from prehistoric times. The boundaries of today's smaller forest encompasses approximately 12.4 hectares, which are preserved as a national historical site (を国の史跡). The woods of this sacred grove are designated by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage site along with other Shinto shrines in its environs.\nThe shrine's annual festival, \"Kamo no Matsuri\", also called Aoi Matsuri, is the oldest of Kyoto's three major festivals. The others are Jidai Matsuri and Gion Matsuri.\n\nThe popular name for \"Kamo-wakeikazuchi jinja\" is the \"Kamigamo jinja\" or Kamigamo Shrine, also called Upper Shrine. In part, it is called the \"upper\" shrine because it is situated on the east bank of the up-stream from its non-identical twin.\n\nThe more commonly used name for \"Kamo-mioya jinja\" is the \"Shimogamo jinja\" or Shimogamo Shrine, also called the Lower Shrine. In part, it is called the \"lower\" shrine because it is situated at the confluence of the and the Kamo River down-stream from its twin.\n\nThe Kamo Shrine is so named because its rituals and festivals are designed to assist in the veneration of the Kamo family of kami and other associated deities; and Kamo kami (\"kami-no-Kamo\") is referenced in other Shinto contexts. In the \"Congratulatory Words of the Chieftain of Izumo,\" the \"sacred grove of Kamo\" is mentioned along with other wooded Shinto sanctuaries at Ō-miwa, Unade and Asuka:\n\nAt the Kamigamo Shrine, Kamo Wake-ikazuchi, the \"kami\" of thunder, is the focus of attention and reverence.\n\nShimogamo Shrine is dedicated to the veneration of Kamo Wake-ikazuchi's mother, Kamo Tamayori-hime. Shimogamo is also dedicated to Kamo Taketsune, who is the father of Kamo Taayori-hime.\n\nAll feature prominently in the annual Aoi Festival, which occurs in May. Featured in this event are a procession between the two shrines, horse races, and demonstrations of mounted archery (\"yabusame\").\n\nKamigamo Shrine's two large conical sand mounds memorialize the holy trees that once served to welcome spirits.\n\nShimogama Shrine has since become one of the key shrines in the area, being associated with prayers to ensure the success of the annual rice harvest. The Shrine is located within \"Tadasu no Mori\" (糺の森), 'the forest of truth,' a primeval forest that is reputed to have never been burned down. The forest has, in fact, suffered some damage over the centuries when all of Kyoto was burned during successive revolts and wars; but the forest growth has rebounded again and again. \"Tadasu no mori\" is left to grow in its natural state. It is neither planted nor pruned.\n\nAlthough Kamigamo and Shimogamo shrines are considered to be paired or twinned, they are not located next to each other. Approximately 2 km. distance separates these two Shinto shrine complexes, which can be explained in part because shrines on the outskirts of Heian-kyō were developed to prevent the infiltration of demons. The Kamogawa river descnds from an ill-omened direction; and the shrines along the flow were positioned in order to prevent demons from using the river to enter the city. Although Kamo-jinja is not directly on the banks of the Kamo River, the site locations were positioned as part of a plan for mitigating the consequences of periodic flooding.\n\nThe shrine became the object of Imperial patronage during the early Heian period. In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered that Imperial messengers were sent to report important events to Japan's guardian \"kami,\" including those venerated at the Kamo Shrine. These \"heihaku\" were initially presented to 16 shrines.\n\nThe lower shrine is that of a \"kami\" mother; and the upper shrine is that of her \"kami\" offspring. The head priests of both have the same title, \"Kamo-no-Agata-no Nushi.\" In \"agata-no-nushi\" titles, the appended noun is typically a place name; but in a Taihō ritsuryō consolidation, the Kamo mirror the Yamato clan's amalgamating conventions in merging the area, its name, its sacred centers and its \"kami\" within a single nominative identifier.\n\nFrom 1871 through 1946, the Kamigamo Shrine was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.\n\nIt is famous for its \"haiden\" (worship hall), rebuilt in 1628-1629 (\"Kan'ei 6\"). A number of priests' residences are situated on its grounds, and one, the Nishimura House, is open to the public.\n\nThe Shimogamo Shrine was officially designated \"Kanpei-taisha\" in 1871.\n\nShimogamo Shrine is believed to be 100 years older than Kamigamo Shrine, dating back to the 6th century.\n\nA shrine structure was erected in 678 during the reign of the Emperor Tenmu, and this became the principal building during the reign or of the Emperor Kanmu when he transferred the capital from Heijō-kyō, and Nagaoka-kyō to Heian-kyō.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He later described how his college years shaped his later political views in a section of the book \"The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia\":\nAfter college, Ames lived in New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Prague, and played briefly in a punk band. He also tried writing screenplays.\n\nIn August 1991, he visited Europe, spending two weeks in St. Petersburg (at that time called Leningrad). Though he returned to live in Foster City, California, he continued thinking of Russia, and delved into Russian literature. After spending mid-1992 to early 1993 in Prague, Ames moved to Moscow.

The paper played practical jokes on \"Pravda\" staffers and public figures including Mikhail Gorbachev. In 2000 Ames and Taibbi published \"The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia.\" \"Chicago Reader\" contributor Martha Bayne reviewed the book, and wrote: \"The product of Ames and Taibbi's union is rude, cruel, pornographic, self-aggrandizing, infantile, and breathtakingly misogynist, with a dozen pages of news and another dozen of gonzo entertainment listings. It's also one of the biggest success stories of the tiny, incestuous world of expatriate Moscow.

It has covered mind-numbingly complex topics like privatization in a straightforward style that's not only comprehensible but actually interesting to a reader with no background in Russian economic history and little enthusiasm for acquiring one.\"\n\nAmes spoke about his sex life in Moscow during an interview with \"The New York Observer\" in 2000: \"'Russian women, especially on the first date, expect you to rape them,' said Mr. Ames. 'They’ll go back home with you and say, ‘No, no, no,’ and if you’re an American, you’ve been trained to respect the ‘No,’ because you’re afraid of sexual harassment or date rape, and so you fail over and over.

The central span was considered quite long (but not the longest, at 340 metres) at the time of its opening and is still one of the 100 largest suspension bridges.\n\nConstruction commenced on 14 November 1922 with the bridge being inaugurated on May 13, 1926. The total length is 819.471 metres, with 259 metres of viaduct from the island, a central span of 339.471 metres and 221 metres of viaduct from the mainland.\n\nThe steel structure weighs approximately 5,000 tons, and the foundations and pillars consumed 14,250 m³ of concrete. The two towers rise 74 metres from sea level, and the central span is 43 metres tall.\n\nIt was closed to the public on May 13, 1991 and reopened after complete restoration on December 30, 2019.\n\nThe bridge was commissioned by Hercílio Luz, then governor of the state of Santa Catarina, to be the first permanent link between the island and the mainland. In addition to benefiting the then 40,000 residents of Florianópolis that were dependent on ferries to cross between the island and the mainland, Luz wanted to build the bridge to strengthen the position of Florianópolis as the state capital. At the time, other cities in the state considered the island to be too remote to be the administrative and political centre and consequently there was a movement to transfer the capital to Lages.\n\nThe bridge was designed by the firm of Robinson & Steinman, and was built by the American Bridge Company (ABC). All the material it used was brought from the United States.\n\nIt has the fairly unusual feature that the truss carrying the roadway (a continuous stiffening component) is above the roadway itself and meets up with the eyebar chains making it non-uniform in height. A similar bridge, the Walter Taylor Bridge, was built over the Brisbane River in Brisbane, Australia in 1936.\n\nWhen completed the bridge was the longest eyebar suspension span in existence at that time. The 1,113’ long design features towers with rocker bearings. ABC brought to the project its own experimental heat-treated eyebars, and as project contractor pioneered stiffening techniques that saved materials and money while providing greater rigidity. Another bridge of similar design, the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River in the U.S., collapsed in 1967 due to a failure in one of the eyebars.\n\nLuz didn't get to see his bridge completed, dying in 1924 twelve days after having inaugurated a wooden replica built in XV Square specifically for the symbolic act. Originally intended to be named \"the Independence Bridge\" this was changed after Luz's death in a posthumous tribute. The bridge was inaugurated on May 13, 1926.\n\nFrom the beginning, the funding process was complicated. The first bank that had lent to the Catarina government failed. Thus, a new loan had to be obtained delaying the works. In addition, a manoeuvre of the U.S. bankers arranging the financing made the state of Santa Catarina liable for debts of the failed institution. In the end, the cost reached 14.478 trillion reis, ten times the original estimate and almost double the state budget at the time. The repayment of loans, made by U.S. banks, was completed in 1978, more than 50 years after the inauguration of the bridge.\n\nWith two other bridges (Colombo Sales Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge) now linking the island to the mainland, the Hercílio Luz Bridge was closed in 1982 on safety concerns. It reopened again on March 15, 1988 to pedestrian traffic, bicycles, motorcycles and horse-drawn vehicles only. It closed completely on July 4, 1991, after a report analyzing the feasibility of reopening the bridge to vehicular traffic was presented in February 1990. In 1997 the landmark bridge was declared a historical and artistic monument.\n\nRestoration of the bridge was investigated by a partnership involving the Federal Government, State Government, and the Municipality of Florianópolis. Submission of restoration plans occurred in mid-2013. \n\nRestoration work on the approach spans began in 2006, and was completed in 2008 at a cost of .\n\nRestoration work on the main span was supposed to begin in 2009, but after delays by the contractor the contract was split into two parts. Rehabilitation of the bridge was started in 2016 by the Portuguese company Teixeira Duarte. Four midspan piers and an under-deck truss were constructed to support the bridge deck during the restoration. The restoration was extensive, involving the replacement of the entire eyebar suspension system, and the pin joints at the bases of the towers.

The album's sound influenced bands such as Discharge, Agnostic Front and Stormtroopers of Death. A medley of \"War\", \"Disorder\" and \"UK 82\", covered by Slayer and Ice-T is featured in the soundtrack for the 1993 film \"Judgement Night\". The chorus of \"UK 82\" was changed to \"LA 92\" to reflect the 1992 Los Angeles riots. \"UK 82\" was also used as the opening and closing track to the 1983 film \"Made in Britain\", starring Tim Roth.\n\nThe video for the song \"U.S.A.\" starts off with an intro saying \"And so... a Pandora's box of rejection and reaction was opened. Today, thousands carry on the greatest anti-movement of our age. Punk rock, the end of our dreams...\" (UK/DK: A Film About Punks and Skinheads, 1983). After the intro, the band performs on a stage with Gary McCormack playing the bass guitar, Big John Duncan playing the electric guitar and Danny Heatley playing the drums. There are also occasionally clips of the band walking down the street in Scotland and are having a little fun before they walk in a building, possibly the building in which they are shown performing. A brief interview begins after the song, in which Wattie explains his views on why punk music was still flourishing (where he tells the interviewer \"it never died!\") and how the band struggled with their previous image as a fascist band as they used to wear Swastika armbands.\n\nThe Exploited are not and have never been a fascist band.

{"id": "2159778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159778", "title": "Reproductive health", "text": "Reproductive health\n\nWithin the framework of the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, reproductive health, or sexual health/hygiene, addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life. UN agencies claim sexual and reproductive health includes physical, as well as psychological well-being vis-a-vis sexuality.\n\nReproductive health implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and safer sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of birth control; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual, reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.\n\nIndividuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.\n\nThe WHO assessed in 2008 that \"Reproductive and sexual ill-health accounts for 20% of the global burden of ill-health for women, and 14% for men.\" Reproductive health is a part of sexual and reproductive health and rights. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health deprive women of the right to make \"crucial choices about their own bodies and futures\", affecting family welfare. Women bear and usually nurture children, so their reproductive health is inseparable from gender equality. Denial of such rights also worsens poverty.\n\nAdolescent health creates a major global burden and has a great deal of additional and diverse complications compared to adult reproductive health such as early pregnancy and parenting issues, difficulties accessing contraception and safe abortions, lack of healthcare access, and high rates of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, and mental health issues. Each of those can be affected by outside political, economic and socio-cultural influences. For most adolescent females, they have yet to complete their body growth trajectories, therefore adding a pregnancy exposes them to a predisposition to complications. These complications range from anemia, malaria, HIV and other STI's, postpartum bleeding and other postpartum complications, mental health disorders such as depression and suicidal thoughts or attempts. In 2016, adolescent birth rates between the ages of 15-19 was 45 per 1000. In 2014, 1 in 3 experienced sexual violence, and there more than 1.2 million deaths. The top three leading causes of death in females between the ages of 15-19 are maternal conditions 10.1%, self-harm 9.6%, and road conditions 6.1%.\n\nThe causes for teenage pregnancy are vast and diverse. In developing countries, young women are pressured to marry for different reasons. One reason is to bear children to help with work, another on a dowry system to increase the families income, another is due to prearranged marriages. These reasons tie back to financial needs of girls' family, cultural norms, religious beliefs and external conflicts.\n\nAdolescent pregnancy, especially in developing countries, carries increased health risks, and contributes to maintaining the cycle of poverty. The availability and type of sex education for teenagers varies in different parts of the world. LGBT teens may suffer additional problems if they live in places where homosexual activity is socially disapproved and/or illegal; in extreme cases there can be depression, social isolation and even suicide among LGBT youth.\n\nNinety nine percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries and in 25 years, maternal mortality globally dropped to 44%. Statistically, a woman's chance of survival during childbirth is closely tied to her social economic status, access to healthcare, where she lives geographically, and cultural norms. To compare, a woman dies of complications from childbirth every minute in developing countries versus a total of 1% of total maternal mortality deaths in developed countries. Women in developing countries have little access to family planning services, different cultural practices, have lack of information, birthing attendants, prenatal care, birth control, postnatal care, lack of access to health care and are typically in poverty. In 2015, those in low-income countries had access to antenatal care visits averaged to 40% and were preventable. All these reasons lead to an increase in the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR).\n\nOne of the international Sustainable Development Goals developed by United Nations is to improve maternal health by a targeted 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Most models of maternal health encompass family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care. All care after childbirth recovery is typically excluded, which includes pre-menopause and aging into old age. During childbirth, women typically die from severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, delivery complications, or an unsafe abortion. Other reasons can be regional such as complications related to diseases such as malaria and AIDS during pregnancy. The younger the women is when she gives birth, the more at risk her and her baby is for complications and possibly mortality.\n\nThere is a significant relationship between the quality of maternal services made\navailable and the greater financial standings of a country. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia\nexemplify this as these regions are significantly deprived of medical staff and affordable health\nopportunities. Most countries provide for their health services through a combination of\nfunding from government tax revenue and local households. Poorer nations or regions with\nextremely concentrated wealth can leave citizens on the margins uncared for or overlooked.\nHowever, the lack of proper leadership can result in a nation's public sectors being\nmishandled or poorly performing despite said nation's resources and standing. In addition,\npoorer nations funding their medical services through taxes places a greater financial burden on\nthe public and effectively the mothers themselves.\nResponsibility and accountability on the part of mental health sectors are strongly\nemphasized as to what will remedy the poor quality of maternal health globally. The impact\nof different maternal health interventions across the globe stagger variously and are vastly\nuneven. This is the result of a lack of political and financial commitment to the issue as most\nsafe motherhood programs internationally have to compete for significant funding. Some\nresolve that if global survival initiatives were promoted and properly funded it would prove to be\nmutually beneficial for the international community. Investing in maternal health would\nultimately advance several issues such as: gender inequality, poverty and general global health\nstandards. As it currently stands, pregnant women are subjugated to high financial costs\nthroughout the duration of their term internationally that are highly taxing and strenuous.\n\nAccess to reproductive health services is very poor in many countries. Women are often unable to access maternal health services due to lack of knowledge about the existence of such services or lack of freedom of movement. Some women are subjected to forced pregnancy and banned from leaving the home. In many countries, women are not allowed to leave home without a male relative or husband, and therefore their ability to access medical services is limited. Therefore, increasing women's autonomy is needed in order to improve reproductive health, however doing may require a cultural shift. According to the WHO, \"All women need access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support in the weeks after childbirth\".\n\nThe fact that the law allows certain reproductive health services, it does not necessary ensure that such services are \"de facto\" available to people. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being conscientious objectors.\n\nIn developing regions of the world, there are about 214 million women who want to avoid pregnancy but are unable to use safe and effective family planning methods. When taken correctly, the combined oral contraceptive pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. However, it does not protect from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some methods, such as using condoms, achieve both protection from STIs and unwanted pregnancies. There are also natural family planning methods, which may be preferred by religious people, but some very conservative religious groups, such as the Quiverfull movement, oppose these methods too, because they advocate the maximization of procreation. One of the oldest ways to reduce unwanted pregnancy is coitus interruptus - still widely used in the developing world.\n\nThere are many types of contraceptives. One type of contraceptive includes barrier methods. One barrier method includes condoms for males and females. Both types stop sperm from entering the woman's uterus, thereby preventing pregnancy from occurring. Another type of contraception is the birth control pill, which stops ovulation from occurring by combining the chemicals progestin and estrogen. Many women use this method of contraception, however they discontinue using it equally as much as they use it. One reason for this is because of the side effects that may occur from using the pill, and because some health care providers do not take women's concerns about negative side effects seriously. The use of the birth control pill is common in western countries, and\ntwo forms of combined oral contraceptives are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.\n\nThere are many objections to the use of birth control, both historically and in the present day. One argument against birth control usage states that there is no need for birth control to begin with. This argument was levied in 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected president, and the argument stated that since birth rates were at their lowest point since World War II ended, birth control was not necessary. Demographic planning arguments were also the basis of the population policy of Nicolae Ceaușescu in communist Romania, who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. Such policies consider that coercion is an acceptable means of reaching demographic targets. Religious objections are based on the view that premarital sex should not happen, while married couples should have as many children as possible. As such, the Catholic Church encourages premarital abstinence from sex. This argument was written out in \"Humanae Vitae\", a papal encyclical released in 1968. The Catholic Church bases its argument against birth control pills on the basis that birth control pills undermine the natural law of God. The Catholic Church also argues against birth control on the basis of family size, with Cardinal Mercier of Belgium arguing,  \"...the duties of conscience are above worldly considerations, and besides, it is the large families who are the best\" (Reiterman, 216). Another argument states that women should use natural methods of contraception in place of artificial ones, such as having sexual intercourse when one is infertile.\n\nSupport for contraception is based on views such as reproductive rights, women's rights, and the necessity to prevent child abandonment and child poverty. The World Health Organization states that \"By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children\".\n\nA Sexually transmitted infection (STI) --previously known as a \"sexually transmitted disease (STD)\" or \"venereal disease (VD)--\" is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of sexual activity. The CDC analyses the eight most common STI's: chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, and trichomoniasis.\n\nThere are more than 600 million cases of STI's worldwide and more than 20 million new cases within the United States. Numbers of such high magnitude weigh a heavy burden on the local and global economy. A study conducted at Oxford University in 2015 concluded that despite giving participants early antiviral medications (ART), they still cost an estimated $256 billion over 2 decades. HIV testing done at modest rates could reduce HIV infections by 21%, HIV retention by 54% and HIV mortality rates by 64%, with a cost-effectiveness ration of $45,300 per Quality-adjusted life year. However, the study concluded that the United States has led to an excess in infections, treatment costs, and deaths, even when interventions do not improve over all survival rates.\n\nThere is a profound reduction on STI rates once those who are sexually active are educated about transmissions, condom promotion, interventions targeted at key and vulnerable populations through a comprehensive Sex education courses or programs. South Africa's policy addresses the needs of women at risk for HIV and who are HIV positive as well as their partners and children. The policy also promotes screening activities related to sexual health such as HIV counseling and testing as well as testing for other STIs, tuberculosis, cervical cancer, and breast cancer.\n\nYoung African American women are at a higher risk for STI's, including HIV. A recent study published outside of Atlanta, Georgia collected data (demographic, psychological, and behavioral measures) with a vaginal swab to confirm the presence of STIs. They found a profound difference that those women who had graduated from college were far less likely to have STIs, potentially be benefiting from a reduction in vulnerability to acquiring STIs/HIV as they gain in education status and potentially move up in demographic areas and/or status.\n\nGlobally, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year. The vast majority of such unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral, legal, and religious status of induced abortion. The sides involved in the debate are the self-described “pro-choice” and “pro-life” movements. “Pro-choice” emphasizes the right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. “Pro-life” emphasizes the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate to term and be born. Both terms are considered loaded in mainstream media, where terms such as “abortion rights” or “anti-abortion” are generally preferred. Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates using violence, such as murder and arson.\n\nArticles from the World Health Organization call legal abortion a fundamental right of women regardless of where they live, and argue that unsafe abortion is a silent pandemic. In 2005, it was estimated that 19-20 million abortions had complications, some complications are permanent, while another estimated 68,000 women died from unsafe abortions. Having access to safe abortion can have positive impacts on women's health and life, and vice versa. \"Legislation of abortion on request is necessary but an insufficient step towards improving women's health. In some countries where it abortion is legal, and has been for decades, there has been no improvement in access to adequate services making abortion unsafe due to lack of healthcare services. It is hard to get an abortion due to legal and policy barriers, social and cultural barriers (gender discrimination, poverty, religious restrictions, lack of support etc., health system barriers (lack of facilities or trained personnel), however safe abortions with trained personnel, good social support, and access to facilities, can improve maternal health and increase reproductive health later in life.\n\nThe Maputo Protocol, which was adopted by the African Union in the form of a protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, states at Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: \"(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus.\" The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right.\n\nThe \"General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to life\", adopted by the Human Rights Committee in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered soft law, and, as such, not legally binding).\n\n\"Although States parties may adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them to physical or mental pain or suffering which violates article 7, discriminate against them or arbitrarily interfere with their privacy. \"States parties must provide safe, legal and effective access to abortion where the life and health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, and where carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or suffering, most notably where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or is not viable.\" [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do not have to undertake unsafe abortions, and they should revise their abortion laws accordingly. [9] For example, they should not take measures such as criminalizing pregnancies by unmarried women or apply criminal sanctions against women and girls undergoing abortion [10] or against medical service providers assisting them in doing so, since taking such measures compel women and girls to resort to unsafe abortion. States parties should not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers [11] that deny effective access by women and girls to safe and legal abortion [12], including barriers caused as a result of the exercise of conscientious objection by individual medical providers. [13]\"\n\nWhen negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women considers the criminalization of abortion a \"violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights\" and a form of \"gender based violence\"; paragraph 18 of its \"General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19\" states that: \"Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care, forced continuation of pregnancy, abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\" The same \"General Recommendation\" also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:\na) Provisions that allow, tolerate or condone forms of gender based violence against women, including [...] legislation that criminalises abortion\".\n\nIn 2008, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a group comprising members from 47 European countries, has adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.\n\nAccesses to abortion is not only a question of legality, but also an issue of overcoming de \"facto barriers\", such as conscientious objections from medical stuff, high prices, lack of knowledge about the law, lack of access to medical care (especially in rural areas). The \"de facto\" inability of women to access abortion even in countries where it is legal is highly controversial because it results in a situation where women have rights only on paper not in practice; the UN in its 2017 resolution on \"Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence\" urged states to guarantee access to \"safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law\".\n\nThere are two primary arguments for maintaining legalized abortion today in the U.S. The first is recognizing the full citizenship of women. The Roe v. Wade court case on abortion compared the citizenship of women and fetuses Because the Constitution defines born people as citizens, Justice Harry Blackmun ruled that fetuses were not citizens. The citizenship of women is emphasized because fetuses are not individual entities that can exist without the woman. Another reason why the full citizenship of women is defined by advocates for abortion is that it recognizes the right of women to manage their own bodies. Fertility affects women's bodies. The argument for abortion prevents others from making decisions that alter a woman's body. Pro-choice advocates also attempt to confirm that state-mandated education or other outside biases don't attempt to influence these decisions. Feminists argue that women throughout history have had to justify their citizenship politically and socially. The right to manage one's own body is a matter of health, safety, and respect. The citizenship of women and the right to manage their own bodies is a societal confirmation that feminists highlight as a pro-choice justification.\n\nThe second primary argument to uphold legalized abortion and creating better access to it is the necessity of abortion and the health and safety of pregnant women. There are two events that largely changed the course of public opinion about abortion in the U.S. The first is Sherry Finkbine, who was denied access to an abortion by the board of obstetrician-gynecologists at her local hospital. Although she was privileged enough to afford the trip, Finkbine was forced to travel to Sweden for an abortion to avoid caring for a damaged fetus in addition to four children. The other event that changed public opinion was the outbreak of rubella in the 1950s and 60s. Because rubella disrupted the growth of fetuses and caused deformities during pregnancy, the California Therapeutic Abortion Act was signed in 1967. This Act allowed doctors to perform abortions when the pregnancy risked the physical or mental health of the pregnant person. These two events are commonly used to show how the health and safety of pregnant women are contingent upon abortions as well as the ability to give birth to and adequately take care of a child. Another argument in favor of legalized abortion to service necessity are the reasons why an abortion might be necessary. Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and over half of all unintended pregnancies in the United States are met with abortion. Unintended pregnancy can lead to serious harm to women and children for reasons such as not being able to afford to raise a baby, inaccessibility to time off of work, difficulties facing single motherhood, difficult socio-economic conditions for women. Unintended pregnancies also have a greater potential for putting women of color at risk due to systematically produced environmental hazards from proximity to pollution, access to livable income, and affordable healthy food. These factors as threats to the health and safety of pregnant women run parallel to data that shows the number of abortions in the United States did not decline while laws restricting legal access to abortion were implemented.\n\nAt a global level, the region with the strictest abortion laws is considered to be Latin America (see Reproductive rights in Latin America), a region strongly influenced by the Catholic Church in Latin America.\n\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital circumcision or cutting, is the traditional, non-medical practice of altering or injuring the female reproductive organs, often by removing all or parts of the external genitalia. It is mostly practiced in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and affects over 200 million women and girls worldwide. More severe forms of FGM are highly concentrated in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.\n\nThe WHO categorizes FGM into four types:\n\n\nFGM often takes the form of a traditional celebration conducted by an elder or community leader. The age that women undergo the procedure varies depending on the culture, although it is most commonly performed on prepubescent girls. Certain cultures value FGM as coming of age ritual for girls, and use it to preserve a woman's virginity and faithfulness to the husband after marriage. It is also closely connected with some traditional ideals of female beauty and hygiene. FGM may or may not have religious connotations depending on the circumstances.\n\nThere are no health benefits of FGM, as it interferes with the natural functions of a woman's and girls' bodies, such as causing severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue, recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, increased risk of infertility, childbirth complications and newborn deaths. Sexual problems are 1.5 more likely to occur in women who have undergone FGM, they may experience painful intercourse, have less sexual satisfaction, and be two times more likely to report lack of sexual desire. In addition, the maternal and fetal death rate is significantly higher due to childbirth complications.\n\nFGM can have severe negative psychological effects on women, both during and after the procedure. These can include long-term symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and low self-esteem. Some women report that the procedure was carried out without their consent and knowledge, and describe feelings of fear and helplessness while it was taking place. A 2018 study found that larger quantities of the hormone cortisol were secreted in women who had undergone FGM, especially those who had experienced more severe forms of the procedure and at an early age. This marks the body's chemical response to trauma and stress, and can indicate a greater risk for developing symptoms of PTSD and other trauma disorders, although there are limited studies showing a direct correlation.\n\nLegislation has been introduced in certain countries to prevent FGM. A 2016 survey of 30 countries showed 24 had policies to manage and prevent FGM, although the process to provide funding, education, and resources were often inconsistent and lacking. Some countries have seen a slight decline in FGM rates, while others show little to no change.\n\nThe Istanbul Convention prohibits FGM (Article 38).\n\nThe practice of forcing young girls into early marriage, common in many parts of the world, is threatening their reproductive health. According to the World Health Organization:\n\n\"The sexual and reproductive health of the female in a child marriage is likely to be jeopardized, as these young girls are often forced into sexual intercourse with an older male spouse with more sexual experience. The female spouse often lacks the status and the knowledge to negotiate for safe sex and contraceptive practices, increasing the risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, as well as the probability of pregnancy at an early age.\" \n\nNiger has the highest prevalence of child marriage under 18 in the world, while Bangladesh has the highest rate of marriage of girls under age 15. Practices such as bride price and dowry can contribute to child and forced marriages.\n\nThe International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) was held in Cairo, Egypt, from 5 to 13 September 1994. Delegations from 179 States took part in negotiations to finalize a Programme of Action on population and development for the next 20 years. Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, UN agencies, NGOs, and the media gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including immigration, infant mortality, birth control, family planning, and the education of women.\n\nIn the ICPD Program of Action, 'reproductive health' is defined as:\n\na state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and...not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of birth control which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.\n\nThis definition of the term is also echoed in the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, or the so-called Beijing Declaration of 1995. However, the ICPD Program of Action, even though it received the support of a large majority of UN Member States, does not enjoy the status of an international legal instrument; it is therefore not legally binding.\n\nThe Program of Action endorses a new strategy which emphasizes the numerous linkages between population and development and focuses on meeting the needs of individual women and men rather than on achieving demographic targets. The ICPD achieved consensus on four qualitative and quantitative goals for the international community, the final two of which have particular relevance for reproductive health:\n\n\nThe keys to this new approach are empowering women, providing them with more choices through expanded access to education and health services, and promoting skill development and employment. The programme advocates making family planning universally available by 2015 or sooner, as part of a broadened approach to reproductive health and rights, provides estimates of the levels of national resources and international assistance that will be required, and calls on governments to make these resources available.\n\nHalf of the development goals put on by the United Nations started in 2000 to 2015 with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Reproductive health was Goal 5 out of 8. To monitor the progress, the UN agreed to four indicators:\n\n\nProgress was slow, and according to the WHO in 2005, about 55% of women did not have sufficient antenatal care and 24% had no access to family planning services. The MDGs expired in 2015 and were replaced with a more comprehensive set of goals to cover a span of 2016-2030 with a total of 17 goals, called the Sustainable Development Goals. All 17 goals are comprehensive in nature and build off one another, but goal 3 is \"To ensure health lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages\". Specific goals are to reduce global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, end preventable deaths of newborns and children, reduce the number by 50% of accidental deaths globally, strengthen the treatment and prevention programs of substance abuse and alcohol.\n\nHIV/AIDS in Africa is a major public health problem. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected world region for prevalence of HIV, especially among young women. 90% of the children in the world living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn most African countries, the total fertility rate is very high, often due to lack of access to contraception and family planning, and practices such as forced and child marriage. Niger, Angola, Mali, Burundi and Somalia have very high fertility rates.\n\nThe updated contraceptive guidelines in South Africa attempt to improve access by providing special service delivery and access considerations for sex workers, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, migrants, men, adolescents, women who are perimenopausal, have a disability, or chronic condition. They also aim to increase access to long acting contraceptive methods, particularly the copper IUD, and the introductions of single rod progestogen implant and combined oestrogen and progestogen injectables. The copper IUD has been provided significantly less frequently than other contraceptive methods but signs of an increase in most provinces were reported. The most frequently provided method was injectable progesterone, which the article acknowledged was not ideal and emphasised condom use with this method because it can increase the risk of HIV: The product made up 49% of South Africa's contraceptive use and up to 90% in some provinces.\n\nTanzanian provider perspectives address the obstacles to consistent contraceptive use in their communities. It was found that the capability of dispensaries to service patients was determined by inconsistent reproductive goals, low educational attainment, misconceptions about the side effects of contraceptives, and social factors such as gender dynamics, spousal dynamics, economic conditions, religious norms, cultural norms, and constraints in supply chains. A provider referenced and example of propaganda spread about the side effects of contraception: \"There are influential people, for example elders and religious leaders. They normally convince people that condoms contain some microorganisms and contraceptive pills cause cancer\". Another said that women often had pressure from their spouse or family that caused them to use birth control secretly or to discontinue use, and that women frequently preferred undetectable methods for this reason. Access was also hindered as a result of a lack in properly trained medical personnel: \"Shortage of the medical attendant...is a challenge, we are not able to attend to a big number of clients, also we do not have enough education which makes us unable to provide women with the methods they want\". The majority of medical centers were staffed by people without medical training and few doctors and nurses, despite federal regulations, due to lack of resources. One center had only one person who was able to insert and remove implants, and without her they were unable to service people who wanted an implant inserted or removed. Another dispensary that carried two methods of birth control shared that they sometimes run out of both materials at the same time. Constraints in supply chains sometimes cause dispensaries to run out of contraceptive materials. Providers also claimed that more male involvement and education would be helpful. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to family planning, by tracking specific, standardized family planning and reproductive health indicators.\n\n\n"}

Designed by Ottawa architect George.M.Moiseyev, who was also project architect for the Children's hospital of eastern Ontario, the church is located at 99 Stonehurst Avenue in the Mechanicsville area of Ottawa. It is part of the Montreal and Canada Diocese of ROCOR.\n\nThe first Orthodox parish to be organized in Ottawa was the Holy Trinity Bukowinian Church. It was started in 1913 by a small group of immigrants from Bukovina who, on the feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God in 1918, consecrated the first Orthodox church in Ottawa. During the 1920s and 1930s, Holy Trinity Church was a place of worship for all Orthodox Christians in the Ottawa area. In the following decades, most of the various Orthodox ethnic groups organized their own parishes in the nation’s capital. Russians, however, continued to pray at the Bukowinian church as it was a member of the Eastern Canadian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.\n\nBy the mid-sixties, the Russian community in Ottawa decided to organize its own Orthodox parish. With the\nblessing of Archbishop Vitaly (Ustinov) of Montreal and Canada, the Protection of the Virgin Mary parish opened in Ottawa on October 21, 1965. At first this new community met in the home of Claudia P. Gitalenko, one of the founding members of the parish. Visiting priest-monks from the St. Job of Pochaev brotherhood in Montreal served at the new church several times a month. Only two years after forming, the parish was able to buy a two-story house at 10 Arthur Street. The building was converted into a church, parish hall, and apartment for the rector. Fr. Theodore, one of the monks of the St. Job of Pochaev brotherhood, was active in furnishing the new church, with the help of the diocesan administration.\n\nIn 1968 Fr. Vladimir Chikanovsky was assigned as the first rector of the Protection parish. During his short stay, a sisterhood and parish school were organized. Fr. Vladimir was replaced as rector by Archimandrite Gregory Moiseevsky in May 1969. Although Fr. Gregory stayed only one year in Ottawa, he is remembered for his love of the church services and for his care in teaching the young people of the parish reading and singing on kliros. In 1970 Fr. Michael Milonow was assigned as the new rector, but was soon transferred to London, Ontario, after which Fr. Dimitri Sever became the parish priest.\n\nBy the end of the sixties it became clear that the recently purchased house-church was not sufficient for the\nneeds of the community, and a search began for a building to replace it. In May 1970 the parish acquired a location at a former Protestant church at 267 Richmond Road. In the several months that followed, the interior of this building was completely rebuilt and decorated to make it suitable for Orthodox worship. Icons were painted by Kirill M. Kotkov for the newly built iconostasis. The exterior of the church was crowned with two Russian cupolas constructed and donated by the church warden from Montreal. For the next eighteen years this church was to be the centre of prayer and fellowship for the Russian Orthodox community in Ottawa. On October 18, 1970, only six months after its purchase, the church on Richmond Road was consecrated by Archbishop Vitaly. Frs. Theodore and Gregory, who had worked diligently to establish the parish, participated in the\nconsecration.\n\nIn the early eighties the parish began exploring the possibility of building a large Russian Orthodox church to\nhouse the growing community. Soon it was decided to build not only a new church, but also a large senior\ncitizens’ residence to house elderly Orthodox Christians who wished to live close to church. This ambitious project was dedicated as a monument to the upcoming 1000-year anniversary of the baptism of Russia.\n\nIn 1986 Fr. George Skrinnikow was assigned as the assistant rector. In the same year, a large piece of land was\nacquired at 89 and 99 Stonehurst Avenue for the construction of the future St. Vladimir’s Russian Seniors’\nResidence and Holy Virgin Protection Church. Throughout the mid-1980s, Orthodox Christians from all over the world sent donations to help build the new church. St. Vladimir’s residence, with 65 apartments for seniors, was completed in 1987.\n\nThe newly built memorial church was consecrated on August 6, 1989, by Metropolitan Vitaly, Archbishop Laurus (Škurla) of Holy Trinity Monastery, and Archbishop Paul (Pavlov) of Australia who in the sixties, while still a priest-monk, had travelled from Montreal to serve at the newly organized Protection parish in Ottawa. In 1989 T. N. Vartanova was commissioned to paint the icons for the five-tiered iconostasis.\n\nFr. Dimitri was removed as the rector of the Protection of the Holy Virgin parish in September 1999. The\nfollowing years proved difficult for the parish. In 2002, after several other priests had served as rectors, Fr. George Skrinnikow was assigned as the new parish priest and life began to return to normal. In 2004 Fr. Stelian Liabotis was assigned as the assistant rector and, in 2006 replaced Fr. George, who retired, as the senior priest. Under their guidance the parish school was reestablished and classes for adults organized. People were again catechized, baptized, and married. Work on the iconostasis resumed and was finally completed in 2011.\n\nIn 2013 Archbishop Gabriel (Chemodakov), the ruling bishop of the Canadian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia and the rector of the parish assigned Fr. Alexis Pjawka as his assistant in Ottawa. For the past half century, the Protection of the Holy Virgin parish in Ottawa has served the Russian Orthodox community in Ottawa and southeastern Ontario. Former members of the parish include a bishop, a deacon, nuns, choir conductors, and seminarians, serving God in various parts of Canada. Today the parish is a multi-ethnic community with Orthodox Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Arabs, Romanians and Canadian converts joining with Russians from all three immigrations and their descendants to worship God.\n\nSeveral charitable fundraisers are held by the church throughout the year. In the spring, the parish hosts a Blini. Since October 2012, the parish has held its annual Taste of Russia Festival in which local artists present a variety of performances and wares including traditional Russian dance, paintings, and genuine Russian products. The licensed event provides a unique opportunity in Ottawa for attendants to purchase Russian beverages and homemade Russian cuisine.\n\n"}
{"id": "2159805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159805", "title": "Transformer oil", "text": "Transformer oil\n\nTransformer oil or insulating oil is an oil that is stable at high temperatures and has excellent electrical insulating properties. It is used in oil-filled transformers, some types of high-voltage capacitors, fluorescent lamp ballasts (North America only), and some types of high-voltage switches and circuit breakers. Its functions are to insulate, suppress corona discharge and arcing, and to serve as a coolant.\n\nTransformer oil is most often based on mineral oil, but alternative formulations with better engineering or environmental properties are growing in popularity.\n\nTransformer oil's primary functions are to insulate and cool a transformer. It must therefore have high dielectric strength, thermal conductivity, and chemical stability, and must keep these properties when held at high temperatures for extended periods. Typical specifications are: flash point 140 °C or greater, pour point −40 °C or lower, dielectric breakdown voltage 28 kV (RMS) or greater.\n\nTo improve cooling of large power transformers, the oil-filled tank may have external radiators through which the oil circulates by natural convection. Power transformers with capacities of thousands of kVA may also have cooling fans, oil pumps, and even oil-to-water heat exchangers.\n\nPower transformers undergo prolonged drying processes, using electrical self-heating, the application of a vacuum, or both to ensure that the transformer is completely free of water vapor before the insulating oil is introduced. This helps prevent corona formation and subsequent electrical breakdown under load.\n\nOil filled transformers with a conservator (oil reservoir) may have a gas detector relay (Buchholz relay). These safety devices detect the buildup of gas inside the transformer due to corona discharge, overheating, or an internal electric arc. On a slow accumulation of gas, or rapid pressure rise, these devices can trip a protective circuit breaker to remove power from the transformer. Transformers without conservators are usually equipped with sudden pressure relays, which perform a similar function as the Buchholz relay.\n\nMineral oil is generally effective as a transformer oil, but it has some serious disadvantages, of which the worst is its flammability. If a transformer leaks mineral oil, it can potentially start a fire. Fire codes often require that transformers inside buildings use a less flammable liquid, or the use of dry-type transformers with no liquid at all. Mineral oil is also an environmental contaminant, and its insulating properties are rapidly degraded by even small amounts of water. Transformers are well equipped to keep water outside the oil for this reason. Mineral oils are still widely used in the industry. \n\nPentaerythritol tetra fatty acid natural and synthetic esters have emerged as an increasingly common mineral oil alternative, especially in high-fire-risk applications such as indoors or offshore, due to their low volatility and high fire point, which can be over 300 °C. They also have a lower pour point, greater moisture tolerance, and improved function at high temperatures, and they are non-toxic and readily biodegradable. Silicone or fluorocarbon-based oils, which are even less flammable, are also used, but they are more expensive than esters, and less biodegradable.\n\nResearchers are experimenting with vegetable-based formulations, using coconut oil for instance. As yet these are unsuitable for use in cold climates or for voltages over 230 kV. Researchers are also investigating nanofluids for transformer use; these would be used as additives to improve the stability and thermal and electrical properties of the oil.\n\nPolychlorinated Biphenyls, are a man-made substance first synthesized over a century ago and found to have desirable properties that led to their widespread use. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were formerly used as transformer oil, since they have high dielectric strength and are not flammable. Unfortunately, they are also toxic, bioaccumulative, not at all biodegradable, and difficult to dispose of safely. When burned, they form even more toxic products, such as chlorinated dioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans. Beginning in the 1970s, production and new uses of PCBs were banned in many countries, due to concerns about the accumulation of PCBs and toxicity of their byproducts. For instance, in the USA, production of PCBs was banned in 1979 under the Toxic Substances Control Act. In many countries significant programs are in place to reclaim and safely destroy PCB contaminated equipment. One method that can be used to reclaim PCB contaminated transformer oil is the application of a PCB removal system, also called a PCB dechlorination system. PCB removal systems use an alkali dispersion to strip the chlorine atoms from the other molecules in a chemical reaction. This forms PCB-free transformer oil and a PCB-free sludge. The two can then be separated via a centrifuge. The sludge can be disposed as regular non-PCB industrial waste. The treated transformer oil is fully restored, meeting the required standards, without any detectable PCB content. It can, thus, be used as the insulating fluid in transformers again.\n\nPCBs and mineral oil are miscible in all proportions, and sometimes the same equipment (drums, pumps, hoses, and so on) was used for either type of liquid, so PCB contamination of transformer oil continues to be a concern. For instance, under present regulations, concentrations of PCBs exceeding 5 parts per million can cause an oil to be classified as hazardous waste in California.\n\nTransformer oils are subject to electrical and mechanical stresses while a transformer is in operation. In addition there is contamination caused by chemical interactions with windings and other solid insulation, catalyzed by high operating temperature. The original chemical properties of transformer oil change gradually, rendering it ineffective for its intended purpose after many years. Oil in large transformers and electrical apparatus is periodically tested for its electrical and chemical properties, to make sure it is suitable for further use. Sometimes oil condition can be improved by filtration and treatment. Tests can be divided into:\n\nThe details of conducting these tests are available in standards released by IEC, ASTM, IS, BS, and testing can be done by any of the methods. The Furan and DGA tests are specifically not for determining the quality of transformer oil, but for determining any abnormalities in the internal windings of the transformer or the paper insulation of the transformer, which cannot be otherwise detected without a complete overhaul of the transformer. Suggested intervals for these test are:\n\nSome transformer oil tests can be carried out in the field, using portable test apparatus. Other tests, such as dissolved gas, normally require a sample to be sent to a laboratory. Electronic on-line dissolved gas detectors can be connected to important or distressed transformers to continually monitor gas generation trends.\n\nTo determine the insulating property of the dielectric oil, an oil sample is taken from the device under test, and its breakdown voltage is measured on-site according to the following test sequence:\n\n\n"}

The catalyst for its formation was the criminality of the Sydney Ducks. It was revived in 1856 in response to rampant crime and corruption in the municipal government of San Francisco, California. The need for extralegal intervention was apparent with the explosive population growth following the discovery of gold in 1848. The small town of about 900 individuals grew to a booming city of over 20,000 very rapidly. This overwhelming growth in population made it nearly impossible for the previously established law enforcement to regulate any longer which resulted in the organization of vigilantes.\n\nThese militias hanged eight people and forced several elected officials to resign. Each Committee of Vigilance formally relinquished power after three months.\n\nThe 1851 Committee of Vigilance was inaugurated on June 9 with the promulgation of a written doctrine declaring its aims and hanged John Jenkins of Sydney, Australia, on June 10 after he was convicted of stealing a safe from an office in a trial organized by the committee: grand larceny was punishable by death under California law at the time. The June 13 \"Daily Alta California\" printed this statement:\n\nIt boasted a membership of 700 and claimed to operate in parallel to, and in defiance of, the duly constituted city government. Committee members used its headquarters for the interrogation and incarceration of suspects who were denied the benefits of due process. The Committee engaged in policing, investigating disreputable boarding houses and vessels, deporting immigrants, and parading its militia. Four people were hanged by the Committee; one was whipped (a common punishment at that time); fourteen were deported to Australia; fourteen were informally ordered to leave California; fifteen were handed over to public authorities; and forty-one were discharged. The 1851 Committee of Vigilance was dissolved during the September elections, but its executive members continued to meet into 1853.\n\nA total of four were executed: John Jenkens, an Australian from Sydney accused of burglary, who was hanged on June 10, 1851; James Stuart, also from Sydney and accused of murder, who was hanged on July 11, 1851; and Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, associates of Stuart accused of \"various heinous crimes\", who were hanged on August 24, 1851. The lynching of Whittaker and McKenzie occurred three days after a standoff between the Committee and the nascent police force trying to protect the prisoners; the Committee nabbed Whittaker and McKenzie after storming the jail during Sunday church services.\n\nThe Committee also tried to punish arsonists.\n\nThe Committee of Vigilance was reorganized on 14 May 1856 by many of the leaders from the first one and adopted an amended version of the 1851 constitution. Unlike the earlier Committee, and the vigilante tradition generally, the 1856 Committee was concerned with not only civil crimes but also politics and political corruption. The catalyst for the Committee was a murder, in the guise of a political duel in which James P. Casey shot opposition newspaper editor James King of William. King, along with many San Francisco residents, was outraged by Casey's appointment to the city board of supervisors and believed that the election had been rigged. The motivation behind this murder came from King's publishing, in the \"Daily Evening Bulletin\", an article accusing Casey of illegal activities, and had served a prison term for Grand Larceny in New York. The combination of the political unrest surrounding the election and the article resulted in Casey's shooting of James King.\n\nThe 1856 Committee was also much larger than the Committee of 1851, claiming 6,000 in its ranks. The Committee worked very closely with the formal government of San Francisco. President of the vigilance committee, William T. Coleman was a close friend of Governor J. Neely Johnson and the two men met on several occasions working towards the shared goal of stabilizing the town. Another important figure at this time who would later come to make a name for himself in the Civil War is William T. Sherman. Sherman was running a bank when Governor Johnson requested he become the commander of the San Francisco branch of the state militia. Sherman accepted the position two days before the murder of King by Casey.\n\nThe 1856 Committee of Vigilance dissolved on 11 August 1856, and marked the occasion with a \"Grand Parade.\"\n\nPolitical power in San Francisco was transferred to a new political party established by the vigilantes, the People's Party, which ruled until 1867 and was eventually absorbed into the Republican Party. The vigilantes had thus succeeded in their objective of usurping power from the Democratic Party machine that hitherto dominated civic politics in the city. Notable people included William Tell Coleman, Martin J. Burke, San Francisco mayor Henry F. Teschemacher, and San Francisco's first chief of police James F. Curtis.\n\nVigilante headquarters in 1856 consisted of assembly halls, meeting rooms, a military kitchen and armory, an infirmary, and prison cells, all of which were fortified with gunny sacks and cannons. Four people were officially executed again in 1856, but the death toll also includes James \"Yankee\" Sullivan, an Irish immigrant and professional boxer who killed himself after being terrorized and detained in a Vigilante cell.\n\nThe 1856 Committee also engaged in policing, investigations, and secret trials, but it far exceeded its predecessor in audacity and rebelliousness. Most notably, it seized three shipments of armaments intended for the state militia and tried the chief justice of the California Supreme Court. The Committee's authority, however, was bolstered by almost all militia units in the city, including the California Guards.\n\nFrom the \"Daily Evening Bulletin\", James King of William, Editor. May 14, 1856:\n\nThere remains historical controversy about the vigilance movements. For example, both Charles Cora and James Casey were hanged in 1856 as murderers by the Committee of Vigilance: Cora shot and killed U.S. Marshal William H. Richardson who had drunkenly insulted Cora's mistress, Belle Cora, while Casey shot James King of William, editor of rival newspaper \"The Evening Bulletin\", for publishing an editorial that exposed Casey's criminal record in New York.\n\nKing had also denounced the corruption of City Officials who he believed had let Cora off the hook for Richardson's murder: Cora's first trial had ended in a hung jury, and there were rumors that the jury had been bribed. Casey's friends sneaked him into the jail precisely because they were afraid that he would be hanged. This hanging may have been a response by frustrated citizens to ineffectual law enforcement, or a belief that due process would result in acquittals. Popular histories have accepted the former view: that the illegality and brutality of the vigilantes was justified by the need to establish law and order in the city.\n\nOne prominent critic of the San Francisco vigilantes was General W. T. Sherman, who resigned from his position as Major-general of the Second Division of Militia in San Francisco. In his memoirs, Sherman wrote:\n\nAs <nowiki>[the vigilantes]</nowiki> controlled the press, they wrote their own history, and the world generally gives them the credit of having purged San Francisco of rowdies and roughs; but their success has given great stimulus to a dangerous principle, that would at any time justify the mob in seizing all the power of government; and who is to say that the Vigilance Committee may not be composed of the worst, instead of the best, elements of a community? Indeed, in San Francisco, as soon as it was demonstrated that the real power had passed from the City Hall to the committee room, the same set of bailiffs, constables, and rowdies that had infested the City Hall were found in the employment of the \"Vigilantes.\"\nA former member of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, physician Max Fifer, moved to Yale, British Columbia at the time of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, and participated in the organization of a Vigilance Committee on the Fraser River in 1858 to address issues of lawlessness and a vacuum of effective governmental authority created by the sudden influx of prospectors to the new British colony. The Vigilance Committee, which in San Francisco had persecuted disgraced Philadelphia lawyer Ned McGowan, played a role in the bloodless McGowan's War on the lower Fraser in 1858–1859. At the end of the so-called \"War\", McGowan was convicted by Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie of an assault against Fifer in British Columbia but McGowan's defense statement, which described some of the activities of the San Francisco vigilantes and his own personal experience of vigilantism, impressed and disturbed Begbie who, like Colonial Governor James Douglas was determined to prevent conditions in the goldfields of British Columbia from deteriorating into mob rule.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many communities such as Seven Meadows, Grand Lakes, and Cinco Ranch are zoned to the school. While the school has a Katy address, it is within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston, and is a high school of the Katy Independent School District (KISD).\n\nThe school was given an \"A\" rating by the Texas Education Agency for the 2018-2019 school year (the highest possible score from the agency). In 2019, the school was ranked 458th in the nation out of 23,000 public high schools in the US by US News; the school was one of three winners of \"The Houston Chronicle's\" Chronicle Cup in 2008 for overall athletic performance.\n\nThe school was originally planned by Katy ISD to relieve overcrowding at Cinco Ranch High School and Katy High School and to better facilitate the influx of students due to new development planned in the general Katy area. The school plan was the same general design used for two other KISD schools, Morton Ranch High School and Cinco Ranch High School, and was designed by PBK Architects. The school's first year in operation was the 2005-2006 school year and had its first graduating class of 408 students in the 2007-2008 school year.

Seven Lakes was designed by PBK Architects, as were many other area schools. It is also the second largest, as well as the most expensive, school in the United States to be built at one time. The total cost of the school came around to $77,424,704 after construction was complete. The name of the school is derived from two major communities that are zoned to it, Seven Meadows and Grand Lakes, taking \"Seven\" from the name of the Seven Meadows community and \"Lakes\" from the name of the Grand Lakes community. While the school is meant only for a maximum of 3,000 students, schools in Katy ISD often become overcrowded due to the rapid development in the area as was the case in 2012, when Seven Lakes reached its peak of 3,957 students.\n\nThe school maintains a rivalry of sorts with Cinco Ranch High School, another high school also located in the same school district as Seven Lakes (Katy Independent School District) and located 3 miles away.

{"id": "2159835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159835", "title": "Girls Just Want to Have Fun (film)", "text": "Girls Just Want to Have Fun (film)\n\nGirls Just Want to Have Fun is a 1985 American romantic comedy dance film directed by Alan Metter and distributed by New World Pictures. It was written by Amy Spies and stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Lee Montgomery, Morgan Woodward, Jonathan Silverman, Shannen Doherty, and Helen Hunt. Its story follows Janey, a new girl in town who meets Lynne, both share a passion for dancing (Dance TV). Together the two enter a competition to be a new Dance TV regular couple, however Janey's father doesn't approve.\n\nThe film was produced by Chuck Russell and was released on April 12, 1985. It grossed $1.7 million in its opening weekend and $6.3 million worldwide, against a budget of $5 million. It received generally negative reviews and has a 38% approval rating based on 13 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite its negative reviews, the film was regularly aired on Comedy Central, Lifetime, USA Network, Lifetime Movie Network and ABC Family for several years and has become a cult film.\n\nJaney Glenn is an army brat whose father Robert has retired from the Army and relocated to Chicago, the home of her favorite dance show \"Dance TV\". At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of \"Dance TV\". Although Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out as a dancer for \"Dance TV\", Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions anyway.\n\nAt the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she narrowly misses Lynne while parking her car. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner is cut (it is later discovered that Natalie bribed Lynne's partner to sabotage her audition). Janey and a local high school kid, Jeff, both shine, and are partnered together once they make the finals. Jeff loves to dance, though he feels pressured to attend trade school after graduation, like his father did before him.\n\nThe two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice, due to her strict father's rules. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling as she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \"Sister Natalie\".\n\nAn excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make hundreds of copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to quite a few odd characters all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the oddballs that were given invites show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl who locked her keys in her car. Meanwhile, a large admirer moves in on her. On Jeff's return, a fight ensues and after Jeff sucker punches the much larger man, they run out of the club together. Once at Janey's house, she is aglow over what her life has become: she is in the running to become a \"Dance TV\" regular, has a great best friend, as well as a boyfriend. They finally kiss before she excitedly runs inside.\n\nGiven the total wreck the party became, the rivalry with Natalie has intensified. She convinces her father to become more involved in ensuring her win. This is an easy feat considering that her father owns the company that Jeff's father works for. One day, Natalie's father, J.P. Sands, corners Jeff and tells him that if Natalie does not win, Jeff's father will lose his job. This puts him in a bad mood and he has a falling-out with Janey when he arrives at rehearsal. Her mood quickly matches his when she arrives home and sneaks into the house only to find that her father has installed a security system. He then grounds her for her continuous deception, making it virtually impossible for her to attend the dance contest final the next day.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff's surly attitude and decreased desire to be in the contest is noticed by his father. Once he finally gets his son to talk, he simply asks if he can win the contest. When Jeff answers yes, he is instructed to do so and not to worry about his father's job. However, Janey is still on restriction and does not know Jeff has changed his mind. However, that changes when her little brother brings her a message that Jeff will compete and she employs Lynne to get her out of the house undetected.\n\nOnce Lynne arrives, Janey cuts the wires to the security system and escapes the clutches of the guard dog. When they arrive at the station, Janey makes the elevator up to the studio and Lynne does not. She barely makes the beginning of the show, embracing and kissing Jeff as she arrives. The show begins and the competition is underway. At home, Janey's family turns on the television and sees her dancing. Her father, furious, storms out of the house, on the way to the studio. Meanwhile, Jeff's father watches the show from his neighborhood pub, surrounded by friends who are all cheering on Jeff and Janey.\n\nAfter all of the dancers have performed on the live show, the decision comes back: there is a tie between Janey and Jeff and Natalie and her partner. A dance-off ensues. Natalie goes first and when done, strolls off the stage proudly, believing she has won. But after Janey tells Jeff \"Let's do it\", they pull out all the stops with a series of synchronized gymnastics Janey has taught Jeff over their time together. When the judges deliberate again, the decision is unanimous: Jeff and Janey win. Natalie is furious and begins to berate her partner over costing her the contest. When she goes to her father to complain, he finally puts his foot down and tells his spoiled daughter to shut up, to her amazement. When Janey spots her father in the studio, she thinks she is in for trouble, but he smiles and shows his enthusiasm at her obvious talent. Miss Dance TV is called to the stage and when she enters, it is none other than Lynne, who has received the job when the former Miss Dance TV quit during the show.\n\nIn July 1984 New World announced they would make a film inspired by Cyndi Lauper's hit song \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\". The company bought the rights to the song and title from songwriter Robert Hazard's publishing company but Lauper said she did not want to appear in the film and refused to allow her version to be used. The filmmakers were not allowed to use the alternations that Lauper made to the song, including adding several lyrics.\n\nIn October the studio announced Sarah Jessica Parker was starring; she was known at the time for the TV series \"Square Pegs\". Parker said she agreed to do the film because the (uncredited) screenwriter, Janis Hirsch, who was one of the writers on \"Square Pegs\".\n\n\"Janis wasn't into depicting people my age being stupid,\" said Parker. \"I was impressed with her fondness for two best friends who aren't competitive.\"\n\nHelen Hunt said \"They were looking for Goldie (Hawn) types when I was called in. But the director (Alan Metter) pulled me aside and said, `Sarah would kill to work with you.' It was really cool. Because I knew she wanted me to do the role, I felt I had the support to overcome my Sarah Lawrence looks.\"\n\nHunt said she was allowed to \"get real creative with who Lynne was... [I] went out and bought all these European magazines-then I did everything that wasn't in them... I felt a responsibility to bring a sense of fun into the picture. And I knew that to do that, I had to have it for myself and then spread it around. So I brought Tofuti (the healthy ice cream) to the set and got a lot of tapes from Tower Records. It helped. When you're making a comedy and it's 2 in the morning and you're tired and nothing's going right, there's no way you can cut ahead and think, `Boy, this is going to be exciting when it comes out.' \"\n\nThe film received generally poor to mixed reviews whilst certain critics considered the \"cheesiness\" factor a reason to watch the film others said that this was not a successful addition to the genre \"80s teen movie\".\n\nThe \"New York Times\" called it \"standard high school antics\" where Metter \"has a lighthearted if unremarkable style. The best thing he does here is to assemble a cute cast and simply let the kids bubble along. Helen Hunt is a real scene-stealer.\"\n\nThe \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" said \"Its main characters are appealing and well-acted\" and has \"a very clever parody of rock TV shows\" but \"degenerates into a mirthless comedy about young love and the generation gap, with a few feeble dance sequences thrown in to give viewers a chance to ogle young girls in leotards.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"infectious good fun\".\n\nThe film opened at number ten at the box office in its first week making $1.6 million.\n\nThis 1985 film's title is almost certainly based on the 1983 hit by Cyndi Lauper. However, Cyndi Lauper's version of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" does not play in this film, due to licensing restrictions. Instead a cover of the song by unknowns Deborah Galli, Tami Holbrook, and Meredith Marshall is featured. The most popular song from the soundtrack is \"(Come On) Shout\", performed by session singer, Alex Brown. The song and the accompanying music video brought Alex some momentary fame during the time of the movie's release.\n\n20th Century Fox and Lakeshore Entertainment in 2009 announced that they were working on a remake of the film and had hired Michelle Morgan to write the script. As of 2019, the film has not been made.\n\n"}

It was one of the first pieces purchased for a collection of apparatus by clergyman and physicist Robert Walker. It is located in a corridor adjacent to the foyer of the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford, England, and is still ringing, though inaudibly due to being behind two layers of glass.\n\nThe experiment consists of two brass bells, each positioned beneath a dry pile (a form of battery), the pair of piles connected in series. The clapper is a metal sphere approximately 4 mm in diameter suspended between the piles, which rings the bells alternately due to electrostatic force. As the clapper touches one bell, it is charged by one pile, and then electrostatically repelled, being attracted to the other bell. On hitting the other bell, the process repeats. The use of electrostatic forces means that while high voltage is required to create motion, only a tiny amount of charge is carried from one bell to the other, which is why the piles have been able to last since the apparatus was set up. Its oscillation frequency is 2 hertz.\n\nThe exact composition of the dry piles is unknown, but it is known that they have been coated with molten sulphur for insulation and it is thought that they may be Zamboni piles.\n\nAt one point this sort of device played an important role in distinguishing between two different theories of electrical action: the theory of contact tension (an obsolete scientific theory based on then-prevailing electrostatic principles) and the theory of chemical action.\n\nThe Oxford Electric Bell does not demonstrate perpetual motion. The bell will eventually stop when the dry piles have distributed their charges equally if the clapper does not wear out first. The Bell has produced approximately 10 billion rings since 1840 and holds the Guinness World Record as \"the world's most durable battery [delivering] ceaseless tintinnabulation\".\n\nApart from occasional short interruptions caused by high humidity, the bell has rung continuously since 1840. The bell may have been constructed in 1825.\n\n\n"}

Chronic ulcerative dermatopathy or chronic erosive dermatopathy are symptoms of similar conditions with different etiology.\n\nHLLE begins as small pits of receding epithelium (skin) around the fish's head and/or lateral line, and sometimes onto the unpaired fins. Rarely fatal, it does cause disfigurement, making the fish less suitable for public aquarium display. At least 20 families of fish have been identified as having developed HLLE in captivity. Not all species of fish show the same symptoms, and do not always develop lesions to the same degree.\n\nHLLE has not been sufficiently studied to identify all causes. In marine fish, two studies point to the use of activated carbon in closed aquarium ecosystems as contributors. \n\nHole in the head can be reversed by removing all activated carbon and conducting large percentage water changes. Greater than 90% water changes may need to be done to reduce the effects of activated carbon. More commonly, cures are made by moving the fish to a new aquarium that has never had fish develop HLLE in it.\n"}

Elliott\n\nRobert Brown Elliott (August 11, 1842 – August 9, 1884) was an African-American member of the United States House of Representatives from South Carolina, serving from 1871 to 1874.\n\nHe was born in 1842 in Liverpool, England. He attended High Holborn Academy in London, England and then studied law, graduating from Eton College in 1859. From there he joined the British Royal Navy.  Elliott decided to settle in South Carolina in 1867. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1868 and began practicing law in Columbia, the state capital.\n\nElliott arrived in South Carolina in 1867 at the age of 25, where he established a law practice. Elliott helped organize the local Republican Party and served in the state constitutional convention in 1868 as a delegate from the Edgefield district. In the late 1860s he was hired by AME bishop and fellow future congressman Richard H. Cain to be an associate editor of the paper, the \"South Carolina Leader\" (renamed the \"Missionary Record\" in 1868), along with another future congressman, Alonzo J. Ransier\n\nIn 1868 he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives. The next year he was appointed assistant adjutant-general; he was the first African-American commanding general of the South Carolina National Guard. As part of his job, he helped form a state militia to fight the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nElliott was elected as a Republican to the Forty-second, defeating Democrat John E. Bacon, and Forty-third United States Congress, defeating Democrat William H. McCann. In Congress in April 1871 he gave a notable speech on the \"Bill to Enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution\", also known as the \"Ku Klux Bill\". He again \"delivered a celebrated speech\" in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1875. He resigned on November 1, 1874, to serve as sheriff and fight political corruption in South Carolina. He served again in the South Carolina House of Representatives, where he was elected as Speaker of the House.\n\nHe ran successfully for South Carolina Attorney General in 1876. In the state elections that year, white Democrats regained dominance of the state legislature. The following year, 1877, when the last of the federal troops were withdrawn from South Carolina, he was forced out of office. In 1878 he formed a law partnership with D. Augustus Straker and T. McCants Stewart.\n\nHe continued to be involved in politics, working on then-Treasury Secretary John Sherman's campaign for President in 1880, and was a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention. In January 1881 he was part of a black delegation that met with President James Garfield to protest the lack of civil and political rights in the South. However, his law practice faltered. In 1879, he was appointed a customs inspector for the Treasury Department in Charleston, South Carolina. He contracted malaria while working in that capacity on a trip to Florida. In 1881, he was transferred to New Orleans, and in 1882 he was dismissed. In New Orleans he again attempted to practice law, but found few clients. Impoverished, he died in New Orleans on August 9, 1884.\n\n\n\n"}

She is the only female Assistant District Attorney (ADA) to have appeared in five complete seasons in any \"Law & Order\" series and the second-longest-running ADA in the entire franchise.\n\nCasey Novak is a young and focused senior-assistant district attorney who's been with the Manhattan DA's office since 2001. It is revealed in early season five that she graduated from Harvard Law School, as seen on a plaque in her office. While sometimes deeply affected by the horrific crimes she deals with on the job, she does not often reveal her emotions. Although she quickly loses her innocence when dealing with sex crimes, she still shows uneasiness when dealing with the gray areas of human involvement, preferring the letter of the law to the messiness of each individual reality. Nonetheless, Novak has a 71 percent success rate in the cases she prosecutes, whereas the average for prosecutors is 44 percent.\n\nIt is revealed that in her final year of law school, Novak was engaged to a man, Charlie, who suffered from schizophrenia. She ended the relationship when his symptoms became so severe she felt she was no longer safe with him. In 2002, Charlie attacked her in her home during a psychotic episode. She convinced the police not to press charges, but ended the relationship. He eventually became homeless, and was found dead as a \"John Doe\" in the spring of 2007. She developed a deep compassion for the mentally ill afterward. While prosecuting a case, she deliberately sabotages a competency hearing for a schizophrenic child rapist to avoid him being extradited to Louisiana where he would face the death penalty. Manhattan's new DA Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) calls Novak into his office and threatens to fire her and have her disbarred if she abuses the authority of the DA's office again.\n\nIn the season 6 episode \"Goliath\", Novak states that she is a big supporter of the U.S military. She explains that her father was an M60 door gunner on a Huey during the Vietnam War. His helicopter crashed three times, and he received a Purple Heart.\n\nNovak lives in an apartment in the Upper West Side of New York City. She is Catholic. She used to work serving tables in order to pay for her college tuition. Sometimes, she rides her bicycle to work.\n\nNovak is a redhead, although she had her hair dyed strawberry blonde and blonde for some of her appearances. She is also an avid softball player and a batter. She plays on a team called the \"Sex Crimes.\"\n\nNovak prosecuted white collar crimes before being assigned full-time to the 16th Precinct in October 2003, after Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March), thought to be dead, transfers into the Witness Protection Program. During her first case, Novak helps the SVU team save a little girl from a pedophile. Following her first case, Novak asks District Attorney Arthur Branch (Fred Thompson) to reassign her because she feels she cannot handle the intensity of prosecuting sex crimes, especially those committed against children. Branch refuses, saying that he had been eyeing her for the job for some time, and thought that she was a perfect choice for the position.\n\nNovak arrives on the scene with guns blazing, intent on leaving her mark on the bureau, and immediately antagonizes detectives Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) by taking a hands-on approach, second-guessing their detective work and interfering with their interrogation of a suspect. Her intuition leads to the rescue of a child locked in a cooler on her very first case, and wins her the respect of the squad. She remains aloof and demanding with the detectives, however, until Capt. Don Cragen (Dann Florek) has a candid conversation with her about the necessity of working as a team, as she had previously worked with different cops in each case. By the sixth season, however, she has a good relationship with the SVU detectives, particularly Stabler, who is especially enraged when she is attacked and beaten up, and risks his career by threatening the man he believed to have done it.\n\nNovak has an adversarial relationship with her former supervisor and mentor, Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light). In one case, Novak forces her (acting upon a directive from Branch) to recuse herself from a case. Occasionally, she finds herself opposing attorneys with whom she has worked before. Like her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot, she has, at various times, run afoul of stern, by-the-book Judge Lena Petrovsky (Joanna Merlin).\n\nTowards the end of the , it was announced that Diane Neal was departing the cast. Days later, it was rumored that she had been fired from the series; Neal noting that she \"did talk to the crew\" about her departure. However, she declined to say whether she was fired. \"Rumors are rumors [...] I love the crew. The crew loves me. We've really gotten along and bonded over these past five years. And they're always looking out for me and watching my back.\"\n\nIn the season 9 finale \"Cold\", Novak violates due process by violating the Brady rules while prosecuting a corrupt police officer who raped two 14-year-old illegal immigrants, killing one. Donnelly, now a judge, calls Novak into her chambers and informs her that the DA had declined to refile charges against the defendant because of her actions. Donnelly informs Novak that she is facing censure by the Bar and a suspension of her license to practice law for at least a year.\n\nIn the second episode of , ADA Kim Greylek (Michaela McManus) asserts that Novak was disbarred for the violation.\n\nNovak returns to SVU in the season 12 episode \"\", and reveals she was censured but not disbarred; her license was suspended for three years. In her first case after being re-hired by the District Attorney's office, she finds herself at odds with \"\" Deputy District Attorney Joe Dekker (Terrence Howard), who is the defendant's lawyer as well as his cousin. Dekker cites Novak's previous misconduct several times throughout the episode. When the case goes to trial, the presiding judge is Lena Petrovsky, whom Novak lied to in the season 9 finale. When Dekker's cousin goes against the deal in place at the allocution hearing and says he only broke into the woman's house and did not rape her, Petrovsky asks Novak if she is trying to railroad another defendant into custody; a shocked Novak replies that both the defendant and his attorney agreed to the deal. In the end, Novak and Stabler realize that the accuser made the rape story up because her grandfather told her to. Novak subsequently makes a deal with Dekker for his cousin's breaking and entering charge and has the accuser arrested for perjury.\n\nNovak, along with ADA Alex Cabot, returned to \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" for its 13th season. She is first seen in the season's third episode \"\", in which the SVU squad is investigating the teenage son of a high-profile political couple. She gets into a heated argument with Benson after she tells her that she is \"off,\" to which Benson replies that Novak and her office have \"lost their nerve.\" Novak is the prosecutor in four episodes during season 13, sharing the ADA duties with Cabot, Michael Cutter (Linus Roache), and David Haden (Harry Connick, Jr.) She is last seen as the lead prosecutor in \"Valentine's Day\", in which she goes up against Defense Attorney Marvin Exley (Ron Rifkin), who is defending a woman who seems to have fabricated her own abduction.\n\nNeal has been credited in 112 episodes of \"SVU\" (appearing in 105) as Novak. Additionally, she appears in a 2005 episode of \"\", bringing her total episode count to 113.\n"}

Founded in 1870 by northern Baptists, it was originally a teachers' college. It has since expanded to offer majors in many disciplines across the liberal arts.\n\nBenedict College was founded in 1870 on a forced-labor camp in Columbia, South Carolina. Under the auspices of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, Mrs. Bathsheba A. Benedict of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, provided the amount of $13,000.00 to purchase the land to open Benedict Institute on December 12, 1870. This new school was established for the recently emancipated people of African descent.\n\nBenedict's first class consisted of ten freedmen and one teacher, the Reverend Timothy L. Dodge, D.D. He was a college-trained preacher from the North, who became president of the Institute. Benedict Institute set out from humble beginnings in a dilapidated former slaveholder's mansion to prepare men and women to be \"powers for good in society\". The dilapidated mansion, built in 1839, served as the first schoolhouse, where grammar school subjects, along with Bible and theology, were taught. Eventually, other subjects were added to the curriculum to address the original objective of the school: to train teachers and preachers.\n\nOn November 2, 1894, the institution was chartered as a liberal arts college by the South Carolina Legislature and the name Benedict Institute was changed to Benedict College.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1930, Benedict College was led by a succession of seven northern white Baptist ministers, all college trained. On April 10, 1930, the Reverend John J. Starks, who earned his bachelor's degree from the college in 1891, became the first African-American president of the college. Five African-American presidents have succeeded him.\n\nIn 1994, with a strategic planning process in place, Benedict College set an enrollment goal of \"2000 by the year 2000\". The goal was achieved in 1996 with an enrollment of 2,138 students. The fall 2002 enrollment was 3,000. Benedict College is engaged in an ongoing strategic planning process, which will guide the college in the 21st century.\n\nThe college is implementing a $50 million campus improvement plan, which includes land acquisition and the completion of a comprehensive athletics complex. Campus facilities improvements over the past nine years have included installation of air-conditioning, fire sprinkler systems, and security systems in residence halls; completion of an activities field and community park; renovation of historic Antisdel Chapel, Bacoats and Alumni Halls, and restoration of historic Morgan, Pratt, and Starks halls, including the Student Leadership Development Center. During this period, new construction has included three residence halls, a parking garage, a campus center/dining hall, an Administration Building, and a Business Development Center. Additionally, buildings were acquired to house a fitness center, and the Division of Community Development/Center for Excellence. Three apartment complexes have been purchased for student housing. As a part of the college's community development thrust, more than 50 dilapidated properties in the adjacent community have been renovated.\n\nThe Benedict College Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It encompasses five buildings constructed between 1895 and 1937: Morgan Hall (1895), Pratt Hall (1902), Duckett Hall (1925), Antisdel Chapel (1932), and Starks Center (1937).\n\nBenedict offers 29 degrees from 12 departments.\n\nIn addition to offering traditional education, the college also offers continuing education for those \"non-traditional students\".\n\nBenedict College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate degrees.\n\nThe Teacher Education Program is fully approved by the South Carolina Department of Education and the Program in Social Work is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The Environmental Health Science Program is fully accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council (EHAC).\n\nBenedict College, known athletically as the Tigers, competes as a member of the NCAA Division II's Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC). The college sponsors 14 varsity sports; men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, tennis, track and field, and volleyball while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The college has built the Charlie W. Johnson Stadium for its football games on-campus, which opened in 2006. Basketball games are played at HRC Arena. The college's cheer is \"Break an arm, break a leg, Benedict!\" The Benedict's Tigers Tennis Team won the SIAC Conference in 2015.\n\nBenedict's Marching Tigers \"Band of Distinction\" was founded in the 1960s under the direction of Roy McCollough. The band performs at most football games, home basketball games, and several special events throughout the year in the Georgia Dome of Atlanta, Georgia. The band is currently under the direction of Henry Wade Johnson.\n\n"}

The known tide heights, probable weather, extent and depth of flooding, and coastal flooding elsewhere in the UK on the same day all point to the cause being a storm surge rather than a tsunami.\n\nOn 30 January 1607, around noon, the coasts of the Bristol Channel suffered from unexpectedly high floodings that broke the coastal defences in several places. Low-lying places in Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, and South Wales were flooded. The devastation was particularly severe on the Welsh side, extending from Laugharne in Carmarthenshire to above Chepstow in Monmouthshire. Cardiff was the most badly affected town, with the foundations of St Mary's Church destroyed.\n\nIt is estimated that 2,000 or more people were drowned, houses and villages were swept away, an estimated of farmland inundated, and livestock destroyed, wrecking the local economy along the coasts of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary.\n\nThe coast of Devon and the Somerset Levels as far inland as Glastonbury Tor, from the coast, were also affected. The sea wall at Burnham-on-Sea gave way, and the water flowed over the low-lying levels and moors.\n\nThirty villages in Somerset were affected, including Brean which was \"swallowed up\" and where seven out of the nine houses were destroyed with 26 of the inhabitants dying. For ten days the Church of All Saints at Kingston Seymour, near Weston-super-Mare, was filled with water to a depth of . A chiselled mark remains showing that the maximum height of the water was 7.74 metres (25 feet 5 inches) above sea level.\n\nA number of commemorative plaques still remain, up to above sea level, showing how high the waters rose on the sides of surviving churches. For example, at Goldcliff near Newport the church has a small brass plaque, inside on the north wall near the altar, today about above ground level, marking the height of the flood waters. The plaque records the year as 1606 because, under the Julian calendar in use at that time, the new year did not start until Lady Day, 25 March. The resultant financial loss in the parish was estimated as £5,000.\n\nThe flood was commemorated in a contemporary pamphlet entitled \"God's warning to the people of England by the great overflowing of the waters or floods\".\n\nContemporary accounts of the flood were written by people such as the Puritan pamphleteer, William Jones:\nThere are similarities to descriptions of the 1953 floods in East Anglia which were caused by a storm surge. A 2006 paper by Horsburgh and Horritt demonstrated that the tide and probable weather at the time were capable of generating a surge consistent with the observed inundation. They point to an exceptionally high spring tide in the Bristol Channel on 30 January 1607 of 7.86m, a severe south-westerly gale with peak winds measured at Barnstaple from 3am to noon, and coastal flooding in East Anglia at night on the 30th consistent with a storm tracking eastward.\n\nAn earlier 2002 research paper, following investigations by Professor Simon Haslett of Bath Spa University and Australian geologist Ted Bryant of the University of Wollongong, suggested that the flooding may have been caused by a tsunami, after the authors had read some eyewitness accounts in the historical reports which described the flood. The British Geological Survey has suggested that, as there is no evidence of a landslide off the continental shelf, a tsunami would most likely have been caused by an earthquake on a known unstable fault off the coast of southwest Ireland, causing the vertical displacement of the sea floor. One contemporary report describes an earth tremor on the morning of the flood; however, other sources date this earthquake to a few months after the event.\n\nHaslett and Bryant's evidence for the tsunami hypothesis included massive boulders that had been displaced up the beach by enormous force; a layer up to thick composed of sand, shells and stones within an otherwise constant deposit of mud that was found in boreholes from Devon to Gloucestershire and the Gower Peninsula; and rock erosion characteristic of high water velocities throughout the Severn Estuary.\n\nHowever, in attributing the flood to a storm surge in their 2006 paper, Horsburgh and Horritt show that those proposing a tsunami hypothesis underestimate the volume of water and coastal damage involved in storm surges, and failed to account both for flooding on the opposite side of the country on the same day. There is also a lack of evidence for the event impacting West Wales, Cornwall or southern Ireland. Their tsunami modelling showed that it would not be possible for a tsunami not to affect these areas and cause flooding elsewhere in the country. Contemporary sources also indicate the flooding proceeded for a period of five hours, which is consistent with a storm surge rather than a tsunami.\n\nWhile the risk of similar events in the foreseeable future is considered to be low, it is estimated that the potential cost caused by comparable flooding to residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural property could range from £7 to £13 billion at 2007 insured values. There has also been concern that the nuclear power stations at Hinkley Point and Oldbury could be endangered.\n\nOn the 400th anniversary, 30 January 2007, BBC Somerset looked at the possible causes and asked whether it could happen again in the county.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2159915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159915", "title": "Thomas D. Clark", "text": "Thomas D. Clark\n\nThomas Dionysius Clark (July 14, 1903 – June 28, 2005) was an American historian. Clark saved from destruction a large portion of Kentucky's printed history, which later became a core body of documents in the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives. Often referred to as the \"Dean of Historians\" Clark is best known for his 1937 work, \"A History of Kentucky.\" Clark was named Historian Laureate of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1991.\n\nBorn in Louisville, Mississippi to a cotton farmer and a schoolteacher, Thomas Clark received his primary education in a neighborhood school to the third grade . After that he made it only to the seventh grade at his mother's school. He dropped out of school to work at a sawmill and as many southern boys did in those days, helped out on the family farm. At sixteen, he took a job on a dredge boat that scoured the bed of the Pearl River. His mother urged him to get back in school.\n\nIn an interview, Clark recalled:\n\nI left the boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. I accidentally met a boy who told me about an agricultural high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me one thing about my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. Said you look like a big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [and obtained] reasonably basic preparation.\n\nClark had decided that farming, manual labor and river work were not going to meet his needs. At the urging of his parents, he entered the University of Mississippi in September 1925. While there, he met his first mentor, historian Charles S. Sydnor, who held a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University. Even though Clark had but one class under Sydnor, British history, which wasn't even within his interests, the two had \"deep conversations\" about the rich heritage of the old South. Sydnor encouraged Clark to follow his interests into post graduate studies in the field of History.\n\nIt was at Ole Miss that Clark discovered the significance of his birthday and understood for the first time what Bastille Day was about. Clark \"fell in love with learning\" at that time, improved his use of the English language and began to develop writing and study habits that framed the disciplines through which he was to accomplish great things later in his life.\n\nClark had financed his education at Ole Miss with a cotton crop on land his father had given him but before he graduated the funds had all but run out. He then found a golf course that needed tending and took the job. It turned out that budding writer, William Faulkner, also having a hard time with finances, helped Clark tend the golf course. Clark was later quite surprised to see that Faulkner had \"hit the bigtime\" with his writing. He graduated with honors earning a BA in 1928.\n\nClark, through his new-found interest in history had begun attending meetings of the American Historical Association (AHA). It was there that Clark claims to have been exposed to the \"profession\" of the historian through two major personalities he saw at the AHA meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (December 1928):\nUpon hearing the presentations Clark recalls, \" I came home thoroughly convinced I wanted to be a historian.\"\n\nReceiving scholarships to both the University of Cincinnati and to the University of Kentucky, he chose the latter.\nClark went on to receive his master's degree in history but when he would go further, the financial dilemma struck again. At the last minute, he was offered a fellowship at Duke.\n\nAt Duke, Clark centered his research on the American frontier, the development of Midwestern railroads, and slavery issues of the South. While there, he met Martha Elizabeth Turner who was to become his wife of 62 years and mother of his two children . He completed his doctorate in History in 1931. From there, it was back to the University of Kentucky, where he was to teach history by day and develop library resources by night.\n\nClark became a professor at the University of Kentucky in 1931. With few resources at his disposal, he almost single-handedly built Kentucky's history department into a major doctoral program in southern history. At one point its star-studded faculty included Albert D. Kirwan, Clement Eaton, James F. Hopkins, Holman Hamilton, Steven A. Channing, and Charles P. Roland. Clark began a 70-year-long enterprise at cataloging, organizing, rescuing, and preserving Kentucky's history. He established at UK a culture of respect for the heritage and documentation of the past. He re-organized the History department, bringing revolutionary innovations to the way the subject was researched and taught. His comprehensive methods were inclusive and exhaustive in scope and detail yet presented to his students in a logical and eloquent manner.\n\nUpon receiving news that irreplaceable historical documents were being abused and defaced in Frankfort, Dr Clark rushed to the scene from Lexington. There he found that pages of military records of Kentuckians involved in the Battle of 1812 the Mexican war and the Civil War were being used as temporary sleeping cots and pipe lighters. He appealed to the newly elected Gov. A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler to have the documents moved to the Lexington campus. If not for this intervention, vast portions of Kentucky's History would have been missing from the Archives that are preserved to this day. Clark's subsequent appeals to the Legislature and the Governors led to the eventual establishment of the Kentucky Archives Commission in 1957.\n\nDr Thomas Clark became head of the history department in 1941 and a distinguished professor in 1950. His good-natured, down-to-earth style and gentle charm made him a favorite among students and fellow faculty which made it possible for him to recruit the vast amount of help needed to build and maintain the growing Kentucky archives. He labored to lead the effort toward completion and retained the workforce even after his retirement as department head in 1965 and his final retirement as professor in 1968.\n\nClark remained a respected and influential adviser to various government agencies throughout his tenure at the university. He was outspoken in matters of timber and natural resource conservation, fiscal responsibility, constitutional and education reform, and especially human rights. He was capable and articulate in framing current policy against the lessons of history and careful to skillfully represent only primary sources whenever possible – a praxis which earned him immense respect, not only in Kentucky and the US, but around the world. His public visibility earned him a name for taking an appreciation of history to the people – not hiding in the halls of academia.\n\nClark fought to preserve cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations and to promote public awareness and appreciation of the same in his own day:\n\nClark remained an active member of the AHA and spoke on countless occasions in many venues both academic and non-academic. He was a proponent of the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1991. He lived to see the dedication and opening of the Kentucky History Center in Frankfort in April 1999. The Center was renamed after Clark in 2005 as the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History. Clark died on June 28, 2005 at the age of 101.\n\n\n\n\nKentucky Department for Libraries and Archives has a list of Dr. Clark's works at: https://web.archive.org/web/20100409002437/http://www.kdla.ky.gov/resources/KYHistorianLaureate.htm\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2159922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159922", "title": "Express (weaponry)", "text": "Express (weaponry)\n\nThe term express was first applied to hunting rifles and ammunition beginning in the middle 19th century, to indicate a rifle or ammunition capable of higher than typical velocities. The early express cartridges used a heavy charge of black powder to propel a lightweight, often hollow point bullet, at high velocities to maximize point blank range. Later the express cartridges were loaded with nitrocellulose based gunpowder, leading to the Nitro Express cartridges, the first of which was the .450 Nitro Express.\n\nThe term \"express\" is still in use today, and is applied to rifles, ammunition, and a type of iron sight. With the widespread adoption of small bore, high velocity rifle cartridges, the meaning of \"express\" has shifted in modern usage, and refers to high velocity, large bore rifles and ammunition, typically used for hunting large or dangerous game at close range.\n\nThe name originates with a rifle built by James Purdey in 1856 (based on a pattern established a year earlier by William Greener) and named the \"Express Train\", a marketing phrase intended to denote the considerable velocity of the bullet it fired. It was not the first rifle or cartridge of this type but it was Purdey's name \"express\" that stuck.\n\nTo understand the context of the express cartridge, it is necessary to go back to the weapons that preceded them. Early hunting firearms were typically smoothbore, usually firing a spherical projectile. This meant that a given bore size must fire a given weight of projectile, which put significant limits on the external and terminal ballistics of the gun. The significant arc of the slow round ball limited the maximum point-blank range to very short distances, and the spherical nature of the ball required a large bore diameter to carry a ball large and heavy enough to provide a quick kill on large game. These early smoothbore guns were typically measured by gauge, as most modern shotguns still are, rather than by caliber. Typical gauges used ranged from 12 to 4; the 4 gauge, used for large game, fired a massive ball of 1500 grains weight (97 g).\n\nIn the 19th century, rifled firearms increasingly gained popularity, and the cylindrical (conical) bullet was introduced. This allowed a wide range of bullet weights to be used with a single bore size; the .450 Black Powder Express, for example, was loaded with bullets ranging from a 270 grain hollow point bullet for small game such as deer, to a 360 grain solid bullet for use on dangerous game, to even heavier hardened bullets for use on elephant. The early black powder express cartridges used paper patched lead bullets, to prevent lead buildup in the bore at the high velocities. These bullets were made of soft lead, and even in solid form they expanded readily and provided great killing power.\n\nTypically the trajectory height would not be greater than 4.5 inches at and the rifle would have a muzzle velocity of at least . While is not fast by modern standards, it was in the era of black powder and spherical balls. As nitro powders were introduced and became the standard, bores grew smaller, and velocities grew ever larger, until the term \"express\" grew to mean something other than just high velocity. William Greener, for example, splits British sporting rifles at the turn of the 20th century into four classes:\n\nSince then, \"express\" has gradually changed to denote a large bore diameter combined with high velocity. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, for example, lists express cartridges ranging from .360 to .577 caliber. The traditional express rifles were break action designs, either single- or double-barrel designs, and express rifles are still made in this form today. With the advent of repeating actions, many bolt-action rifles were chambered in express cartridges, and often the same cartridge will be found in \"flanged\" and \"rimless\" form, the flanged for break-open actions, and the rimless for easier feed from a bolt-action rifle's magazine.\n\nMany modern rifle cartridges fire large-caliber, heavy bullets at velocities of well over , and the designation \"express\" applies solely to British calibres whereas the word \"magnum\" applies to American calibres. With a few exceptions, such the .242 Rimless Nitro Express from the 1920s, and a brief period around 1980 when Remington renamed their .280 Remington cartridge the \"7 mm Express Remington\", the label \"express\" is today used for short range, big game rifles pushing large, fast bullets.\n\nAnother item to bear the name \"express\" is the iron sight combination, used by William Greener and still found on express rifles today, consisting of a bead front sight and shallow \"V\" rear sight. The large, usually white bead is easily seen in low light and the shallow \"V\" notch provides an unobstructed view of the surrounding area.\n\nTraditional express cartridges tend to be long cases, working at low pressures. This is partially due to their black powder roots, but the low pressure cases are also more reliable under extreme conditions, such as found in African hunting. Modern designs may use the belted magnum design; older ones may be rimmed for break actions or rimless for bolt-action rifles. The bullets were typically short, light, hollow-point designs intended for maximum velocity and ranges out to the maximum point blank range with fixed sights. Early cartridges were loaded with black powder, and many later converted to cordite or other smokeless powders, often yielding two similar cartridges with different loadings, such as the .450 Black Powder Express and the .450 Nitro Express. Older express cartridge ballistics are fairly similar to modern shotgun slug ballistics, while modern big game cartridges, such as the .577 Tyrannosaur and the .585 Nyati, provide ballistics that push the physical limits of the hunter with their tremendous power and recoil.\n\nThere is a large variety of express rounds, including the Nitro Express family of cartridges. Older black powder express cartridges include:\n\n\nExpress rifles historically came in two forms, singles (single shot) and doubles, both break-actions. The side-by-side double was among the earliest, but by the early 20th century the bolt action began to replace it. The double rifle has two barrels, either side-by-side or over-and-under, and either single or double triggers. Most parts of the mechanism that fire the gun are duplicated for redundancy. In the unlikely event that a mechanical failure such as a broken spring or firing pin should occur, the hunter can still fire the second barrel. This design allows the hunter to fire two shots rapidly—the second shot used when the animal is missed or not stopped with the first. If the hunter were using a bolt-action rifle, he would have to work the bolt, taking additional time and possibly affecting the aim. Bolt-action rifles for hunting typically have a small magazine of about five rounds rather than the ten, thirty, or more found on more modern military rifles firing smaller rounds (the maximum number of rounds a hunting rifle can take is fixed by law in many jurisdictions; 2 in the magazine and one in the chamber is the limit in the UK.)\n\nModern express rifles are generally either single-shot or bolt-action designs. Doubles are still made but are quite expensive; getting both barrels to shoot to the point of aim is a labor-intensive process. Single-shot rifles are not often used when hunting dangerous game because follow-up shots are not made as quickly. Single-shot express rifles, such as the Ruger No. 1 Tropical, are more compact than bolt actions, but while they can weigh less, reduced weight tends to increase felt recoil. Lighter rifles are more likely to be in the hunter's hands, ready for a quick shot when game is found.\n\n\n\n"}

The Caxcan established Nochistlán by driving out the Tecuexe by force.\n\nAfter its 841st anniversary of foundation, Nochistlan was named \"Pueblo Mágico\" or \"Magic town\" by the Secretary of Tourism (Mexico), Gloria Guevara Manzo. Nochistlán was the fifth town to be named \"Pueblo Mágico\" in the state of Zacatecas. To be nominated for this category, a town must have symbolic attributions, legends, history, significant cultural traditions, and attract tourists. Nochistlán met all of these requirements, which made it eligible to be taken into further consideration.\n\nNochistlán is known for its traditions as well as its music. It is also often referred to as, “La tierra de los músicos” or “The land of musicians”. Nochistlán has been given this nickname because within the town, there is always music playing. From Mariachi groups, to bands, as well as choirs, it is proud of their different styles of music and is not ashamed of them. In fact, Nochistlán's music is one of the main reasons tourists visit so much, aside from the beautiful architecture. In addition, it is also one of the reasons it was named, “Pueblo Mágico” because of its music. Many of the musicians that form groups come from families that were also in musical groups, which explains why Nochistlán is such a musical place.\n\nThere are 3 main activities that contribute to the economy: agriculture, livestock, and trade.\n\nNochistlán is a very rural place with active transportation. Transportation in this town mostly consists of walking since everything is within walking distance, cars, buses, trucks, as well as horses. Because of this, Nochistlan gives people a very welcoming and an all-original feeling that is unparalleled in a sense. Most of the people who inhabit Nochistlan live by nature. That is, a lot of their resources are native, making Nochistlan somewhat old-fashioned. Nonetheless, in recent years it has been modernizing their ways of living. \n\nThe oldest tradition in Nochistlán is “la fiesta del Papaqui” or translated as, “the party of el Papaqui.” This party is celebrated every year from January 12 to January 20. El Papaqui is a celebration in which the whole town honors and venerates St. Sebastian. St. Sebastian is a very important figure to those who live and are from Nochistlán. During these eight days, everyone walking in the plaza has their face covered with flour, and crack colored eggs filled with confetti on their heads. They also throw oranges, These actions symbolize what was going on during the war between the Natives and Spanish. The flour symbolizes the dirt people would put on their faces to create a more savage look. It is not most about war it is just to celebrate San Sebastián, the Saint most admired from that pueblo.\n\nAnother tradition Nochistlán is famous for is their tradition of every Sunday night. Every Sunday night, people gather in the plaza or, “el Jardín” of Nochistlán for \"la Serenata\" the serenade. All the men of the town form a circle around the plaza while the women walk inside the circle. As the women walk inside the circle, if a man finds a woman attractive, in original tradition, he would give her a Gardenia flower (in most recent, modern tradition, he puts confetti in her hair, or hollowed out eggs with confetti inside) there is also another circle, within the inner circle, where children and married women go around to get confetti too but also they are there so men know they are married or in a relationship. The Gardenia flower (recent tradition, modern tradition, the colorful confetti) symbolizes the beauty of the woman just as flowers (recent tradition, modern tradition, colors) are beautiful. This tradition originally began to honor women and moreover, to make them feel appreciated by men.\n\nThe Virgin of Toyahua is a respected figure in Nochistlán because she is known to grant miracles. Most of the residents of Nochistlán pray to her when they are in need of a marvel. Although Nochistlán is small in size, it is big in religion. The feast of October are religious parties to honor St. Francis of Assisi that are celebrated on the first Sunday of October. During these parties, people gather in the plaza to enjoy music from many bands and mariachi groups. Aside from the music, even though the feast is meant for religious events, it's just a big party with very famous bandas come and perform the parties will last from early 8:00 p.m. and sometimes carry on until 5:00 a.m. all the women in the town come together to make food for those participating in the celebration. The festivities also consist of authentic dances, horse races, and rooster tournaments.\n\nNochistlán is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

It is also spoken in southern Sudan in Magwi County Eastern Equatoria states.\n\n\"Song of Lawino\", well known in African literature, was written in Acholi by Okot p'Bitek, although its sequel, \"Song of Ocol\", was written in English.\n\nAcholi, Alur, and Lango have between 84 and 90 per cent of their vocabulary in common and are mutually intelligible. However, they are often counted as separate languages because their speakers are ethnically distinct. Labwor (Thur), once considered a dialect of Acholi, may not be intelligible with it.\n\nAcholi has vowel harmony: all vowels in a word have to belong to a single class (e.g. \"the cold\" vs. \"to separate\"). There are two sets of five vowels, distinguished by the feature [+/-ATR]. \n\n/pʷ bʷ/ sounds may also sound as labial affricates [pf bv].\n\nAcholi is a tonal language. Thus, some words may be distinguished by tone alone, e.g. \"bèl\" (low) 'wrinkled' vs. \"bél\" (high) 'corn' and \"kàl\" (low) 'place enclosed by a palisade' vs. \"kál\" (high) 'millet'. Tone furthermore plays a role in verb conjugation.\n\nThe above were the old work of the missionaries Alfred Malandra and Crazzolara published in 1955. However, a more up-to-date Acholi orthography by Janet Lakareber shows that a vowel in Acholi language has more than two pronunciations. A monosyllabic word in Acholi has 14 different pronunciations. This is explained in the nine books of Acoli Accented Orthography.\n\n\n\n"}

Ariah never released an official studio album, but they recorded a few songs and played local shows with bands like Vicious Rumors and King Diamond. Ariah disbanded in 1992.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, he joined the power metal band Vicious Rumors to replace guitarist Mark McGee who had left the band after the death of Vicious Rumors vocalist Carl Albert. \"Something Burning\" (1996) was the first album which Smyth played on. It was followed by \"Cyberchrist\" in 1998, and now he participated in songwriting too.\n\nIn 1999 Smyth left Vicious Rumors and joined Testament. The Bay Area thrash legend had just released The Gathering album, but lead guitarist James Murphy was diagnosed with a brain tumor, so Testament were in want of a new guitarist for the forthcoming tour. In the next 5 years Smyth toured with Testament all around the globe and played uncountable shows as a member of the band. He wanted to make a studio album with Testament but that remained a dream for him.\n\nOn the other hand, Smyth formed the band Dragonlord as a side project with guitarist Eric Peterson and bassist Steve DiGiorgio of Testament in 2000. This symphonic black metal outfit have released two albums: \"Rapture\" (2001) and \"Black Wings of Destiny\" (2005).\n\nSeattle-based Nevermore had been friends with Smyth prior to his joining of the band. Initially jokingly, he asked if he could join Nevermore. He joined Nevermore as a touring guitarist, and in 2004, Smyth officially joined the band after helping them tour in Europe. He played guitar in the band along with Jeff Loomis and co-wrote some songs on the critically acclaimed album \"This Godless Endeavor\" (2005).\n\nOn April 30, 2006, Smyth released a message explaining to fans that he has been diagnosed with kidney failure due to a congenital birth defect. Updates followed on May 30, June 3, and August 9, 2006 on his official website. On December 12, 2006, Smyth had a successful kidney transplantation.\n\nSmyth guest starred as Snazz of Pickles' former band Snakes n' Barrels in two episodes of \"Metalocalypse\".\n\nIn the summer of 2007 Smyth left Nevermore due to \"personal and business differences\". At that time he was working on an all-instrumental album in the vein of progressive rock with his former Ariah bandmate and bassist Steve Hoffman.

The Bison Football team is a member of the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Prior to the 1993 season, the Bison played at Dacotah Field. The stadium also plays host to North Dakota State graduation ceremonies as well as many large concerts, other sporting events, and trade shows.\n\nThe building was originally planned to be modeled on the Tacoma Dome and have an inflatable roof. However, as the design evolved, it was decided to have a fixed hard roof, although the dome name stuck.\n\nThe Fargodome has held events such as the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, USHRA's Monster Jam, Rib Fest, World Wrestling Entertainment, World Championship Wrestling, and other local, regional, and national events. The facility briefly played host to the Fargo Freeze Indoor Football League team in 2000, though the team played just one season.\nThe Asics/Vaughan Cadet and Junior National Wrestling Championships (freestyle, Greco-Roman wrestling) takes place every year in the Fargodome in the month of July.\n\nMany famous acts have played the Fargodome including Avenged Sevenfold, Katy Perry, Cher, Guns N' Roses, Fleetwood Mac, Journey, The Rolling Stones, Pearl Jam, Garth Brooks, Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Shania Twain, Taylor Swift, AC/DC, Paul McCartney, Kenny Chesney, The Dave Matthews Band, Carrie Underwood, Aerosmith, Poison, Nsync, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Kiss, Beach Boys, Faith Hill, Bryan Adams, Ozzy Osbourne, Luke Bryan, Pink, Reba McEntire, Dixie Chicks, Lady Antebellum, Bruce Springsteen, Tim McGraw, Def Leppard, Metallica, Prince, Justin Timberlake, and many others.

The addition of 5,000 to 7,500 seats has been discussed since 2011, but is now being seriously considered after several straight years of sold out NDSU Bison football games. That would bring the total capacity for football games to around 25,000. The additional seating would require major structural changes to the dome, including moving the press boxes from the east side to the west side. The west side has been reinforced and could handle extra levels, whereas the east side has a lobby that was not designed to bear any extra load.\n\nIn summer 2016, the stadium video boards were replaced with 12 new interior displays featuring SMD LED technology including two large 30'x100' High Definition video/scoreboards on each endzone, 12'x24' screens behind those large screens for those seated behind the board, and four large 20'x22' High Definition video boards (one in each corner), the $7.7 million project also provided for four ribbon displays on the seating fascia 3' high and 33' long along with a portable 15' x 25' screen which can be moved around on gameday, the project also renovated the electronics room and provided for new computer and graphics technology.

The article cites, \"There aren't many indoor venues in college football, but the few that do exist at the non-FBS level are very unfriendly to any visiting team. That effect is only amplified in a playoff atmosphere.\" The Fargodome is routinely ranked as one of the loudest college football stadiums in the country. On December 14, 2012 in an FCS semifinal game against Georgia Southern, the crowd noise exceeded the 111 decibel mark and was known to be one of the loudest games in NDSU history. The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead conducted an informal study of Fargodome crowd noise from the press box during a playoff semifinal game last December. The readings showed a high of 111 decibels following a late touchdown by quarterback Brock Jensen. The decibel meter consistently read 102–106 throughout that game, according to The Forum.

Unser has competed in the Indy Lights series and Toyota Atlantics Championship. He is the third generation of the famous Unser family.\n\nAl Richard Unser is the son of Al Unser Jr., and grandson of Al Unser Sr.. Due to his family connections in auto racing, he has sometimes been known as \"Al Unser III\" or \"Just Al.\" \n\nAl Richard Unser is the son of two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Al Unser, Jr., grandson of four-time Indy winner Al Unser, Sr., and grandnephew of three-time Indy winner Bobby Unser. Another granduncle, Jerry Unser, drove in the 1958 race but died from injuries suffered in a crash in 1959.\n\nFirst-cousins-once-removed (Al Unser Jr.'s cousins) Robby and Johnny also drove in the Indianapolis 500.\n\nDuring his young childhood years, he was often nicknamed \"Mini Al\" by the media and fans, all with the expectation that he might follow in his family's footsteps to race professionally. However, as a child, Unser had reservations about becoming a race car driver. For superstitious reasons, his father (Al Unser, Jr.) insisted he not be named with the suffix \"III\". By that time both Al Sr. and Al Jr. were stars on the Indy car circuit. Al Sr. was becoming known by the nickname \"Big Al.\" Al Jr. for a time was known as \"Little Al,\" thus Al Richard Unser became known for a time as \"Mini Al.\"\n\nAs he got older and reached his teenage years, he decided to eschew the somewhat unflattering \"Mini\" nickname, and became known as \"Just Al.\" When starting his professional career, he abandoned any sort of nickname, and has insisted on being referred to as \"Just Al\" (i.e., Al Unser), or by his full name, Al Richard Unser.\n\nHis first widely-noticed television appearance was at the 1992 Indianapolis 500 at age nine when his father won the race. Unser was seen greeting his father in victory circle. He also posed in official photos with his father and grandfather when Al Jr. won the Indy 500 for the second time in 1994. Unser guest-starred on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" alongside his father and grandfather in 1997.\n\nAl Richard Unser began driving go karts at age ten, but stopped racing until after earning his driver's license at age sixteen. After attending driving schools, Unser competed in the Skip Barber Western Racing Series in 2002, winning six races and earning \"Rookie of the Year\" honors. A year later, he posted four top-ten finishes in the 2003 Barber Dodge Pro Series.\n\nIn 2004, Unser made his Toyota Atlantics debut, running in four events. His best finish was an 8th place at Montreal. Unser also ran in eight races in the 2004 Infiniti Pro Series. He posted five third place finishes, and won the pole position at Michigan.\n\nAround that same time, Unser's father Al Unser Jr. temporarily retired from driving to help with his career.\n\nUnser posted three top-ten finishes in the first four races of the Infinity Pro Series season, including a 4th place at the Freedom 100 at Indianapolis. He then returned to the Toyota Atlantics, finishing the season 7th in points. He ran ten of twelve events with a best finish of 4th.\n\nAt the Indy Lights races at St. Petersburg and Indianapolis Unser competed against fellow third-generation driver Marco Andretti of the famous rival Andretti family.

The family left PNG for India in 1951, before returning to Perth, Western Australia.\n\nHe attended Guildford Grammar School, where he remained until his expulsion, when he was \"asked to leave\" following a dispute with the headmaster. He spent the last few months of his schooling at Christ Church Grammar School but did not complete his final exams.\n\nHe worked for a time at British national newspaper, \"The Times\", and spent ten years as a foreign correspondent in the United States. On returning to Australia, he was editor of \"The Advertiser\", Adelaide (1988) and \"The Sunday Herald Sun\", Melbourne (1990). During 1990-92 he was editor-in-chief of the Herald & Weekly Times group in Melbourne before becoming a vice-president of Fox News, USA in 1993.\n\nMark Latham was known to weave complaints about Akerman's writing into his speeches.\n\nPeriodically, Akerman was a regular panelist on ABC Television's political commentary program \"Insiders\", until his 16 June 2013 participation. This incident involved unfounded allegations about the then Prime Minister's de facto partner. Akerman had also appeared on the ABC's political program \"Q&A\".\n\nAkerman is a climate change sceptic with a history of public opposition to a carbon price. He approvingly quotes the work of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), run by Fred Singer.\n\nIn a November 2006 article in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Akerman mis-quoted senior IPCC scientist John T. Houghton saying \"Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen\", attributing the quotation to his 1994 book \"Global Warming, The Complete Briefing\". The mis-quote became widely used among climate change sceptics to argue that climate change scientists showed a propensity to exaggerate their case. However, the mis-quote does not appear in any edition of the book. Houghton denied saying any such thing and believes the opposite to be true, commenting \"I would never say we should hype up the risk of climate disasters in order to get noticed.\" In February 2010, Akerman responded by citing a September 1995 article in which Houghton was correctly quoted as saying \"If we want a good environmental policy in the future, we'll have to have a disaster\", adding that this passage was not much different to the misquotation Houghton had distanced himself from. A subsequent report by Media Watch noted that Houghton's full remark did not carry the same meaning: \"If we want a good environmental policy in the future we'll have to have a disaster. It's like safety on public transport. The only way humans will act is if there's been an accident.\"\n\nFive former employees, three of whom agreed to be named, have said they witnessed Akerman \"sexually harass\" female members of his staff, according to a 1991 story in \"The Sunday Age\".\n\nOne of the most controversial episodes in Akerman's life was his alleged threat to assault the literary editor of \"The Advertiser\", Shirley Stott Despoja. The dispute ended before a full bench of the Supreme Court where the newspaper appealed against Stott Despoja's successful worker's compensation claim for stress-related sick leave pay. Stott Despoja alleged: \"I was physically threatened by the editor while alone with him in an office in a dispute over my work\". The appeal by \"The Advertiser\" was dismissed and Stott Despoja won her $4,000 claim.\n\nIn 2006, former director of NRMA Richard James Talbot was awarded a $200,000 defamation payout plus costs. In regards to one point the judgment read \"The inaccuracies of fact by the defendant [Akerman] on this topic are gross\".\n\nIn March 2018 Akerman suggested that gay people need to apologise for child sex abuse.\n\nIn 2017, Akerman wrote that there were more pressing issues worrying Australians than voting on the issue of marriage equality.\n\nIn 2018 he defined the victory of the YES in Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey \"a victory for left's hate\".\n\n"}

They also recorded the Tonio K song \"Perfect World\" for the Christina Applegate film, \"Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead\".\n\nAlias was founded in the late 1980s by two Canadian musicians, songwriter/lead vocalist Freddy Curci and songwriter/lead guitarist Steve DeMarchi.\n\nBefore Alias, Curci and DeMarchi were members of the Canadian rock band Sheriff, from 1979 to 1985. Sheriff's popularity in the club circuit garnered the attention of Capitol Records, which led to their self-titled album \"Sheriff\". Sheriff's singles received a large amount of airplay and reached the No. 1 spot in Canada, due to the success of \"When I'm with You\". Although promotion and distribution problems stalled the record's initial American momentum, the song reached a respectable No. 61 on the \"Billboard\" charts. Reports of fans not being able to buy the record in their local shops plagued Sheriff's American tour. Rigorous touring, frustrations and disappointments caused tensions that split the band in two. In 1985, Sheriff disbanded.\n\nAfter Sheriff, Curci and DeMarchi teamed up to pursue their music. With the financial backing of friends and family, and with the help of DeMarchi's brother Denny (who later played keyboard and sang backing vocals on the \"Alias\" album), they built a recording studio in the DeMarchi family home basement. They worked as couriers during the day, while continuing to write and record at night. Most of these songs would later end up on Alias' self-titled debut album.\n\nIn 1988, 3 years after Sheriff split, their song \"When I'm with You\" re-entered and climbed the US \"Billboard\" chart for a second time. A DJ named Jay Taylor in Las Vegas had played this song on his radio station, resulting in massive audience response and requests for the song.\n\nIn January 1989, Capitol Records made an unprecedented move and re-released the \"Sheriff\" album in the US. \"When I'm with You\" hit No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" chart in February 1989. Curci and DeMarchi tried to get Sheriff back together, but the other members of Sheriff, rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Arnold Lanni and bassist Wolf Hassel (who had formed the successful band Frozen Ghost in 1985) were not interested. Curci and DeMarchi moved on and joined forces with ex-members of Heart: Roger Fisher, Steve Fossen and Mike Derosier, to form Alias.\n\nIn 1990, Alias released its first album, a self-titled debut recorded under the Capitol label. The album went gold in the U.S. and platinum in Canada, while several tracks enjoyed radio airplay in both countries. The power ballad \"More Than Words Can Say\" proved to be the band's biggest hit, climbing to number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot AC chart and number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. A tour followed throughout 1990 (including a stint as the opening act for REO Speedwagon), but while touring, the trio of former Heart musicians decided to leave the band due to musical differences.\n\nIn an interview with \"Strutter\" magazine, Curci indicated that Alias was never formally disbanded:\nThe band also performed twice on \"The Tonight Show\", once with Johnny Carson and once with Jay Leno.\n\nBMI presented Freddy Curci and Steve DeMarchi with the \"Million-air award\" for \"More Than Words Can Say\". According to BMI's website, only 1,500 songs including \"When I'm With You\" by Sheriff have achieved Million-air status (one million air plays) among the 4.5 million songs by 300,000 BMI represented artists. One million performances is the equivalent of approximately 50,000 broadcast hours, or more than 5.7 years of continuous airplay.\n\nIn early 2005, an acoustic version of the band's hit ballad \"More Than Words Can Say\" was released on a VH1 compilation disc, \"Classic Metal Mania: Stripped\".\n\nAlso in early 2005, \"More Than Words Can Say\" was featured in a Subway commercial aired during the Super Bowl.\n\nIn January 2009, Alias announced the release of their long-awaited second album. This album, appropriately titled \"Never Say Never\", was recorded in 1992 and was planned to follow their highly praised debut album, but due to the rapidly evolving music scene of that time where grunge was on the rise and metal was fading, it was never released. A few of the songs from this album were re-recorded and appeared on lead vocalist Freddy Curci's solo album \"Dreamer's Road\", however many tracks remained unreleased until 2009.\n\nOn 6 August 2014, Alias announced on their social media page that they were to play at Sturgis Canada in Merritt BC on 21 August 2014, the first full live show for the band in many years. The reunion band members include original founding members, lead vocalist Freddy Curci and lead guitarist Steve DeMarchi, keyboardist Denny DeMarchi, guitarist Roscoe Stewart, Sheriff bassist Wolf Hassel, and drummer Chris Sutherland.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While in medical school, Tetley found a passion for dance. After graduating from Franklin and Marshall College in 1946, Tetley moved to New York City to study dance.\n\nHe began his career as a dancer, dancing in Hanya Holm's Broadway production of \"Kiss Me, Kate\" in 1948 and \"Juno\" in 1959, as well as with the New York City Opera Ballet, John Butler's American Dance Theatre, and the Joffrey Ballet where he was an original member. Later he danced with American Ballet Theatre and Jerome Robbins's Ballets: USA. Tetley's choreographic style rises from his experiences with modern dance teachers like Hanya Holm and Martha Graham as well as his time with ballet teachers such as Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske. Because of this mix in dance education, Tetley's choreography is a distinct blend between ballet and modern dance. Tetley wanted to achieve a mix of \"modern dance's visceral earthiness with the ethereal lyricism of classical ballet\".\nMary Hinkson, a former dancer from the original Martha Graham company, has assisted Glen Tetley all over the world. Her knowledge of the Graham technique helped shaping ballet dancers into Tetley's choreography.\n\nWhat made Glen Tetley stand out among other choreographers was his ability to seamlessly mix ballet and modern dance. Tetley choreographed over 50 ballets for some of the world's most famous dance companies. Tetley made his choreographic premier in 1962 with \"Pierrot Lunaire\" which he choreographed for his newly formed chamber company. Tetley based this piece on music of the same name by composer Arnold Schoenberg. Though this piece was one of his first choreographic ventures, it is heralded by many as one of his best and most iconic. It is also here where audiences first saw his iconic mix of ballet and modern dance. Other works choreographed by Tetley include: \"Contredances\", \"Gemini\", \"Odalisque\", \"Ricercare\", \"Le Sacre du Printemps\", \"Sargasso\", \"Sphinx\", and \"Voluntaries\". Tetley moved to Europe and became the Artistic Director for the Netherlands Dance Theatre in 1969 and the Stuttgart Ballet where he also danced from 1974–1976, before returning to North America to work with the National Ballet of Canada. While in Europe and Canada, Tetley choreographed many new pieces such as \"Alice\" in 1986 for the National Ballet of Canada. At the time of his departure, many in the American dance community would either train in ballet or modern dance, but never both. Some believe that because of this rigidity and inability to accept the fusion of modern dance and ballet, Tetley moved to Europe where the atmosphere was more artistically free.\n\nThroughout his choreography Tetley displayed \"fervid intensity, sinuous nonstop propulsion, and voluptuous physicality\". While Tetley does not intentionally create abstract pieces, he uses his movement in order to \"convey his meditations on themes from myth, music, theater, and literature\".\n\nHis long term partner of 40 years was Scott Douglas. On January 26, 2007, Tetley died in Florida, aged 80, following a battle with skin cancer. Dancers, such as Karen Kain, a member of the National Ballet of Canada, remember Tetley as a choreographer who had a \"ferocious demand for total artistic commitment\", while David Allan recalls that Tetley \"fired up your imagination and made you look at yourself differently\". Among the members of his chamber company was Christopher Bruce, the lead in his signature work, \"Pierrot Lunaire\" who cites Tetley as one of his inspirations.\n\n"}

He had four siblings, Frederick, William, Margaret, and Marie. On July 12, 1916, their father was shot and killed by his wife in their Caldwell, New Jersey, home. The wife was tried for murder, pleaded self-defense, and was found innocent.\n\nRhodes was married to Ione Boulenger, a teacher, in Brussels, Belgium, in 1936. Selective Service records showed that Rhodes claimed as dependents daughters Ann Margaret and Alice and a son, David. They lived in Knickerbocker Village, New York City, in 1941-43, and around 1946 they moved to Amenia, Dutchess County, New York.\n\nBoulenger was general secretary of the Office International pour l'Enfance in 1938.\n\nRhodes died in Monroe County, Florida, in September 1965.\n\nRhodes attended Columbia University between 1929 and 1933, when he received a bachelor's degree. He received a master's degree there in June 1934. He was rated as a \"very good student, of excellent character and reputation.\" He then received a Kellett Fellowship of $2,000 at Oxford University, where he had an excellent record.\n\nIn late 1936 Rhodes worked for the New York Herald Tribune in Paris, and then he was employed in that city by United Press. He covered the early stages of the German invasion of France in 1940.\n\nHe also worked in London, Copenhagen and Stockholm. He was in Narvik, Norway, \"when the first German destroyers steamed into the harbor and he reported exclusively the part played by the Norwegian commander in delivering the port to the Germans.\" Rhodes wrote a story for United Press recounting his 1940 travel across the Soviet Union on his way to Tokyo, Japan, where he was able to file a report. In August he worked in New York on the cable desk.\n\nWhile awaiting reassignment, Rhodes spoke at a joint meeting of the Cincinnati Lodge of Elks and the Cincinnati Newspaperman's Club in September 1940. On October 24, 1940, Rhodes was guest speaker along with Publisher David Stern of the \"Camden Courier-Post\" at a meeting of the Camden Foremen's Club.\n\nIn 1941 he was assigned to the French island of Martinique, where he investigated reports about \"a mountain of French gold\" worth almost a billion dollars.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Rhodes was a speaker on February 28, 1941, at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, Chamber of Commerce, along with Governor Arthur James, where Rhodes said he disliked being called a \"journalist\" but would rather be referred to as a \"newspaperman.\"\n\nRhodes was next sent to England, where he covered the blitz.\n\nRhodes worked for United China Relief and the Federal Communications Commission in 1941, the Selective Service records showed.\n\nIn 1941, he was also chief of the Atlantic News Service of the Office of War Information, the U.S. State Department reported. Postwar he was with the OWI recruiting personnel \"for operations in psychological warfare,\" where he trained workers \"for newly liberated areas.\" He was described as \"head of monitoring for Psychological Warfare Branch AFHQ [Air Force Headquarters] and later in a similar capacity with the ETO (European Theater of Operations, United States Army) during the war.\"\n\nAn article by Rhodes about French poet Louis Aragon was published in \"Aragon: Poet of the French Resistance,\" edited by Hannah Josephson and Malcolm Cowley in 1945. In 1946 Rinehart & Co. published his translation from the French of \"The Beast of the Haitian Hills\" by Philippe Thoby-Marcelin and Pierre Marcelin. His book \"Beautify Your Home Grounds,\" about property improvement, was published in 1952.\n\nOn February 6, 1942, U.S. Representative Richard B. Wigglesworth, Republican of Massachusetts, included Rhodes in a list of names he read on the floor of the House of Representatives which he said had been furnished to him by the \"[Martin] Dies Committee\" (the House Committee on Un-American Activities) stating that Rhodes, listed as a \"foreign editor,\" had been a delegate of the International Coordinating Committee for Aid to Republican Spain.\n\nIn June 1949, FBI informant Elizabeth Bentley included Rhodes, who was identified as a \"broadcaster for the army in Africa and Sicily,\" in a list of names she furnished to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. She stated they were those of federal employees who had been \"involved in giving information to the Soviet government.\"\n\nJohn Lautner, a former Communist Party, official, told a subcommittee of the Senate Internal Security Committee in October 1952 that Rhodes, a \"former Communist,\" had been \"in charge of intelligence for the Military Government in the Mediterranean.\"\n\nWinston Burdett, a broadcast journalist, testified at a hearing of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on June 28, 1955, that he \"surmised\" that Rhodes was a \"very active Communist sympathizer and partisan of Communist causes.\" He said, \"I did not know Peter Rhodes to be a member of the Communist Party.\" Burdett said he formed his impression from \"my acquaintance with him and particularly his activities.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2160013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160013", "title": "Regulatory enzyme", "text": "Regulatory enzyme\n\nA regulatory enzyme is an enzyme in a biochemical pathway which, through its responses to the presence of certain other biomolecules, regulates the pathway activity. This is usually done for pathways whose products may be needed in different amounts at different times, such as hormone production. Regulatory enzymes exist at high concentrations (low Vmax) so their activity can be increased or decreased with changes in substrate concentrations.\n\nThe enzymes which catalyse chemical reactions again and again are called regulatory enzymes.\n\nGenerally, it is considered that a hyperbolic structured protein in specific media conditions is ready to do its task, it is active, but some specific deactivation, are responsible for the regulation of some metabolism pathways. Regulatory enzymes are commonly the first enzyme in a multienzyme system: the product of the reaction catalyzed by the first enzyme is the substrate of the second enzyme, so the cell can control the amount of resulting product by regulating the activity of the first enzyme of the pathway.\n\nThere are many strategies of activation and deactivation of regulatory enzymes. Regulatory enzymes require an extra activation process and need to pass through some modifications in their 3D in order to become functional, for instance, catalyzing enzymes (regulatory enzymes). The regulation of the activation of these catalyzing enzymes is needed in order to regulate the whole reaction speed, so that it is possible to obtain the amount of product required at any time, that makes regulatory enzymes have a biological importance. Therefore, regulatory enzymes, by its controlled activation and are of two types: allosteric enzymes and covalently modulated enzymes; however, an enzyme can combine both types of regulation.\n\nThis type of enzymes presents two binding sites: the substrate of the enzyme and the effectors. Effectors are small molecules which modulate the enzyme activity; they function through reversible, non-covalent binding of a regulatory metabolite in the allosteric site (which is not the active site). When bound, these metabolites do not participate in catalysis directly, but they are still essential: they lead to conformational changes in a concrete part of the enzyme. These changes affect the overall conformation of the active site, causing modifications on the activity of the reaction.\n\nProperties\n\nAllosteric enzymes are generally larger in mass than other enzymes. Different from having a single subunit enzyme, in this case they are composed of multiple subunits, which contain active sites and regulatory molecule binding sites.\n\nThey present a special kinetics: the cooperation. In here, configuration changes in each chain of the protein strengthen changes in the other chains. These changes occur at the tertiary and quaternary levels of organisation.\n\nBased on modulation, they can be classified in two different groups:\n\n\nIn some multienzyme systems, the enzyme is inhibited by the end product whenever its concentration is above the requirements of the cell. So, the velocity of the reaction can be controlled by the amount of product that is needed by the cell (the lower the requirement is, the slower the reaction goes).\n\nFeedback inhibition is one of the most important function of proteins. Due to feedback inhibition, a cell is able to know whether the amount of a product is enough for its subsistence or there is a lack of the product (or there is too much product). The cell is able to react to this kind of situation in a mechanical way and solve the problem of the amount of a product. An example of feedback inhibition in human cells is the protein aconitase (an enzyme that catalyses the isomeration of citrate to isocitrate). When the cell needs iron, this enzyme loses the iron molecule and its form changes. When this happens, the aconitase is converted to IRPF1, a translation repressor or mRNA stabilizer that represses the formation of iron-binding proteins and favours formation of proteins that can get iron from the cell's reservations \n\nHere, the active and inactive form of the enzymes are altered due to covalent modification of their structures which is catalysed by other enzymes. This type of regulation consists of the addition or elimination of some molecules which can be attached to the enzyme protein. The most important groups that work as modifiers are phosphate, methyl, uridine, adenine and adenosine diphosphate ribosyl. These groups are joined to or eliminated from the protein by other enzymes. The most remarkable covalent modification is phosphorylation.\nSerine, Threonine and Tyrosine are common amino acids that participate in covalent modifications and are used to control enzyme’s catalytic activities. Kinase and phosphatases are commonly known enzymes that affect these modifications, which result in shifting of conformational states of the binding affinity to substrate.\n\nPhosphorylation is the addition of phosphate groups to proteins, which is the most frequent regulatory modification mechanism in our cells. This process takes place in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (in this type of cells, a third or a half of the proteins experience phosphorylation). Because of its frequency, phosphorylation has a lot of importance in regulatory pathways in cells.\n\nThe addition of a phosphoryl group to an enzyme is catalysed by kinase enzymes, while the elimination of this group is catalysed by phosphatase enzymes. The frequency of phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism is due to the ease of changing from phosphorylated form to dephosphorylated form.\n\nPhosphorylation or dephosphorylation make the enzyme be functional at the time when the cell needs the reaction to happen. The effects produced by the addition of phosphoryl groups that regulate the kinetics of a reaction can be divided in two groups:\n\nPhosphorylation and dephosphorylation may take place as a result of the response to signals that warn about a change in the cell state. This means that some pathways where regulatory enzymes participate are regulated by phosphorylation after a specific signal: a change in the cell.\n\nSome enzymes can be phosphorylated in multiple sites. The presence of a phosphoryl group in a part of a protein may depend on the folding of the enzyme (which can make the protein more or less accessible to kinase proteins) and the proximity of other phosphoryl groups.\n\nSome enzymes need to go through a maturation process to be activated. A precursor (inactive state, better known as zymogen) is first synthesized, and then, by cutting some specific peptide bonds (enzymatic catalysis by hydrolytic selective split), its 3D conformation is highly modified into a catalytic functional status, obtaining the active enzyme.\n\nProteolysis is irreversible and normally a non-specific process. The same activator can modulate different regulatory enzymes : once trypsin is activated, it activates many other hydrolytic enzymes. Proteolysis can also be fast and simple so the hydrolysis of a single peptide bond can be enough to change the conformation of the protein and build an active zone, allowing the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate, for instance, chymotrypsin activation (as it can be seen in the images).\n\nMany different types of proteins with different roles in metabolism are activated by proteolysis for big reasons:\n\nProteolysis is irreversible, which implies the need of a process of enzyme deactivation.

They formed in 1982 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.\n\nSteve Walsh had been in the band Kansas and Mike Slamer has been in several other bands, including Britain's City Boy. He was also a session guitarist. Greer and Gehrt were regional players who had seen success with bands in Tennessee and Atlanta, respectively. Gehrt was working with ex-Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes when Walsh recruited him for Walsh's first solo effort, \"Schemer-Dreamer\". Walsh had noticed him when one of Gehrt's earlier bands had opened for Kansas. The two became friends and eventually spoke of forming a band together. Slamer had never met Walsh until he showed up for the audition. \"I decided that I wanted to move to America,\" says Slamer. \"The kind of music that I wanted to make wasn't being played at all in England, so I came here.\"\n\nStreets made its debut performance at Charlie Daniels' annual Volunteer Jam in January, 1983. The band played on another band's equipment and only played four songs. The debut LP was released later that year on Atlantic Records.\n\n\"We got out there and proved that we could play,\" said Walsh. \"We go out there and we did damn good. We proved to ourselves that we could pull it off and that we were on the right track. Starting over was very humbling. But we got a lot of good feedback to the album. We were playing live every night and being onstage (was) very renewing for us...\"\n\n\"I wanted to form a democratic band,\" said Walsh. \"I did not want to be a solo singer with a band of sidemen. I like being in a band... I couldn't have done (that project) alone. I needed the help of every musician involved. We were all of equal importance in the creation of the final song.\"\n\nThe band later recorded its second album, \"Crimes in Mind\", in 1985. Soon after, Streets disbanded. A year later, Walsh reformed Kansas, which had disbanded after two albums without Walsh.\n\n"}

He is best known for his innovative crosspicking and split-string styles of mandolin playing.\n\nMcReynolds was born in Coeburn, Virginia. He and his brother Jim begin performing together in or around 1947. They originally performed under the name, \"The McReynolds Brothers.\" In 1951, Jesse and Jim, joined by Larry Roll on guitar, made their first recording, ten gospel songs for Kentucky Records under the name \"The Virginia Trio\". In 1952, Jim and Jesse signed with Capitol Records, who asked them to change their name from the \"McReynolds Brothers,\" so they started recording under the name \"Jim and Jesse and the Virginia Boys.\". They recorded 20 songs for Capitol over three sessions in 1952, 1953, and 1955. During this time (1952-1954), Jesse also served in the US Army in Korea (they recorded sessions in 1953 while he was on leave). While serving in Korea, he and Charlie Louvin of the Louvin Brothers (who was also serving in Korea) formed a band called the \"Dusty Roads Boys\" and played regular concerts for other troops. After Jesse's return from Korea, Jim and Jesse continued to perform and release albums until Jim's death from cancer in 2002. McReynolds is married to his wife, Joy. \n\nSince 2002, Jesse has continued to perform and record as a solo artist. McReynolds plays between 60 and 70 shows each year. Jim and Jesse became members of the Grand Ole Opry in 1964; Jesse continues to maintain the duo's Opry membership since Jim's death in 2001. He became the oldest standing Opry member in March of 2020, following the death of fellow Opry member Jan Howard. In 2019, he celebrated his 55th anniversary as a member of the Opry.

Thomas is a 6'9\", 230 lb. power forward-center known for his hard-nosed playing style and tough defense during his eight year tenure with the New York Knicks. Drafted by the Miami Heat in 1995, Thomas played college basketball at Texas Christian University.\n\nKurt began his basketball career on the playgrounds at Dallas Birdie Alexander Elementary, D.A. Hulcy Middle School, and thereafter on to Dallas Carter High before transferring to Hillcrest High. Thomas grew up in Dallas, and after graduating from Dallas's Hillcrest High School, he attended Texas Christian University, where he led the NCAA Division I in scoring and rebounding in the 1994–95 season with 28.9 PPG and 14.6 RPG, becoming only the third player in history to accomplish this feat (the other two being Hank Gathers and Xavier McDaniel).\n\nThomas began his NBA career with the Miami Heat from 1995 to 1997. In his rookie season, he started 42 of his 74 games played. The following season, he only played 18 games before suffering a stress fracture in his right ankle, which required surgery. He would miss the rest of the season. During his rehab, Thomas, along with Sasha Danilović and Martin Müürsepp, were traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Jamal Mashburn.\n\nThomas's playing career with Dallas was short. He only played 5 games before suffering another stress fracture in the same ankle he had previously injured. This placed him on the injured list for the remainder of the season. Then-coach and general manager Don Nelson went out of his way to hire Thomas as an assistant coach. In the offseason, Thomas decided to become a free agent, signing with the New York Knicks.\n\nThomas played seven seasons with the New York Knicks from 1998 to 2005, during which the team went to the playoffs four times, including two trips to the Eastern Conference Finals (1999 and 2000) and one trip to the NBA Finals (1999).\n\nThomas played two seasons with the Phoenix Suns from 2005 to 2007.\n\nOn July 20, 2007, Thomas, along with the Suns' first-round draft choices in 2008 and 2010, was traded by the Suns to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for a conditional second-round draft choice and an $8 million trade exception.\n\nThomas was traded by the Sonics to the San Antonio Spurs on February 20, 2008, for Francisco Elson, Brent Barry, and a 2009 first-round draft pick.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, Thomas was traded along with Bruce Bowen and Fabricio Oberto to the Milwaukee Bucks for Richard Jefferson.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, the Chicago Bulls announced that they had signed Kurt Thomas. Because of injuries to the Bulls' starting center Joakim Noah and power forward Carlos Boozer, Kurt Thomas saw some significant playing time, including 37 starts. When Noah and Boozer came back, he experienced minimal playing time with Ömer Aşık playing in front of him on the bench. Although his playing time was slim during this span, Kurt Thomas won the appeal of Chicago fans with some emphatic highlights which were referred to as \"Turning back the Clock\" and eventually earned him the nickname \"Big Sexy\". Thomas averaged more than 20 minutes per game during the 2010-11 season along with 4.1 points and 5.8 rebounds.\n\nOn December 11, 2011, the Portland Trail Blazers signed Thomas for the shortened 2011-2012 season. Though terms for the deal were not disclosed officially, it was reported to be a two-year contract.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, Thomas and Raymond Felton were traded to the New York Knicks for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, the rights to Kostas Papanikolaou and Giorgos Printezis, and a second round draft pick.

Polk to John K. Kane outlining his beliefs on tariffs, free trade, and protectionism during his 1844 campaign for President of the United States.[5]\n\nPolk's letter contained a polished and succinct statement espousing support for moderate tariff relief. Many historians saw this letter as a \"masterly straddle\"[1], but in recent years it has been viewed as Polk's only official position on the contentious and politically divisive tariff issue.[3]\n\nHis opponent Henry Clay by contrast, produced hundreds of letters and public statements on the tariff, including seemingly contradictory views aimed at different audiences. Clay, a staunch supporter of protectionism, lost support when voters perceived his tariff position to be contradictory and favored Polk's consistent and indeed only position in the Kane letter[2]. Pennsylvania Democrats put Polk's and Clay's views on protectionism side by side. Polk was hailed as a better protectionist due to Clay's mistake of excessive public statements.[5]\n\nUpon thinking about the letter at length and the strong stance it took, Polk sent another letter on July 2 to Kane requesting that Kane not publish it. By then it was printed widely and Polk was worried about the dangerous words the letter contained (\"protection\" and \"discrimination\", used several times within the document).\n\nThe Whigs used the letter as leverage against Polk, dredging up Polk's old statements strongly opposing tariffs. Polk was subsequently called upon by the Whigs to make a public statement regarding his position on the Tariff of 1842, which he meekly declined.[2]\n\nTwo members of the United States Senate, George McDuffie and Robert Barnwell Rhett, were furious with the publication of the Kane Letter. McDuffie called for a secession of the South, and threatened raising the \"Banner of Disunion\"[5]. Franklin H. Elmore, Polk's Public Advisor, quickly took hold of the situation in Charleston, persuading McDuffie and his followers that Polk was \"a southern man – a friend of free trade.\"[2]\n\nPolk was no different from many of the political candidates of that time, appealing to the side he was currently speaking to. James K. Polk was simply a better manipulator of men than Clay and so \"defeated the ticket\" in 1844.[2]\n\n1. Charles A.

Walls\n\nJosiah Thomas Walls (December 30, 1842 – May 15, 1905) was a United States congressman who served three terms in the U.S. Congress between 1871 and 1876. He was one of the first African Americans in the United States Congress elected during the Reconstruction Era, and the first black person to be elected to Congress from Florida. He also served four terms in the Florida Senate.\n\nJosiah Walls was born into slavery in 1842 near Winchester, Virginia. During the American Civil War, he was forced to join the Confederate army and work in support. He was captured by the Union Army in 1862 at Yorktown. He voluntarily joined the United States Colored Troops in 1863 and rose to the rank of corporal. He was discharged in Florida and settled in Alachua County, Florida.\n\nWalls served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1868, representing Alachua County. Later that year, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives from Alachua, along with his friend, Henry Harmon, serving in Florida's first Reconstruction Legislature.\nWhen State Senator Horatio Jenkins was appointed to a county judgeship, Walls decided to run in the special election to succeed him. He was elected to the Alachua and Levy County district on December 29, 1868, and took office in January. Walls served as state senator for the 1869 and 1870 legislative session.\n\nIn 1870, Walls was nominated as the Republican candidate for Florida's sole at-large congressional seat after a contentious party convention. A moderate faction of mostly white carpetbaggers, led by U.S. Senator Thomas W. Osborn, supported the freedman Robert Meacham, while the majority of black delegates were split between several more radical black candidates, including Walls. Walls won the nomination on the 11th ballot, after the other black candidates withdrew to prevent Meacham from winning.\n\nWalls went on to win the 1870 general election and serve in the 42nd Congress, but the vote was contested by Democrat Silas L. Niblack. The House Committee on Elections eventually unseated Walls after finding election irregularities.\n\nWalls ran for the at-large congressional seat again in the 1872 election and won. In office, Walls introduced bills to establish a national education fund and aid pensioners and Seminole War Veterans.\n\nIn 1874, Walls ran for re-election to Congress in the newly redistricted 2nd district. Walls won the election but Democrat Jesse J. Finley, a former Confederate colonel, contested the results of the election. Finley was eventually declared the winner by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nWalls again sought the Republican nomination for the 2nd congressional district in 1876. After the black delegates split between Walls and another black candidate, the nomination went to a white carpetbagger, Horatio Bisbee. Walls instead ran for his old state senate seat, and served a four-year term. He lost re-election in 1880.\n\nWalls was admitted to the bar in Alachua County in April 1873. In June 1874, Walls formed a law partnership in Gainesville with Henry S. Harmon, who had been the first African-American admitted to the bar in Florida, and William U. Saunders. The next year Harmon and Saunders moved their legal practice to Tallahassee.\n\nLeaving politics, Walls operated a successful farm in Alachua County until the disastrous freeze of 1894–95, which destroyed his crops. He took a teaching position as Farm Director of the State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students, which much later would become Florida A&M University, in Tallahassee. After nearly a decade there, he died on May 5, 1905.\n\n\n59-78.\n"}

The band achieved major success in the early 1990s but disbanded for several years as glam metal lost mainstream popularity. The most recent lineup reunited in 2007 to tour and record new material.\n\nTrixter was formed in June 1983 in Paramus, New Jersey by natives Steve Brown, and Doug \"Dougie C.\" Cowie. Originally known as Rade, Brown and Cowie added drummer Mike Pane, and later singer Pete Loran to round out the lineup. After a single concert, Pane was replaced with Mark \"Gus\" Scott and the band changed its name to Trixter. By 1986, Trixter was a constant fixture on the concert scene, quickly growing a fan base on the strength of their live shows. By 1987, Trixter was performing to sold out crowds, playing with acts like Kix and Skid Row, and found themselves being courted by several major record labels. In 1988, Trixter began recording at legendary Bear Tracks Studios in New York with engineer Nelson Ayers, most notable for recording Guns N' Roses \"Appetite For Destruction\", on what was intended to become their first studio album titled \"Just Having Fun\". The album was never released and in November 1988, founding member Dougie C. was replaced with local bassist PJ Farley. In May 1989 the band landed a deal with Mechanic/MCA Records.\n\nIn September 1989 the band went to Hollywood to record their debut album with producer Bill Wray. Songs from the 1988 recording session including \"Ride the Whip\" and \"Only Young Once\" made it to the new album. \"Trixter\" was released in May 1990 with the song \"Line of Fire\" as the single for rock radio. The song slowly climbed the charts, reaching No. 1 on Z-Rocks Top 100 by July 1990. Along with the release of the album, Trixter also filmed their first video for the song \"Give It to Me Good\". In September the band headed out on a nationwide tour and after two weeks they landed the opening slot for Stryper. In mid-October Trixter joined Don Dokken for another tour around the USA. It was on this tour that MTV added the video for \"Give It to Me Good\". Within one week the video was No. 1 on the Dial MTV top ten video countdown. The video stayed No. 1 for five weeks straight. \n\nIn December 1990 Trixter filmed the video for the second single, \"One in a Million\", at a sold-out show in Rockland County, New York. The band also recorded a song, \"One Mo Time\", for the film \"If Looks Could Kill\". The song featured Edgar Winter on saxophone. By January 1991 the record was selling 20,000 units per week. The video for \"One in a Million\" went No. 1 on MTV for three weeks. The album peaked at No. 28 on Billboard's Top 200 Album chart and the single for \"Give it to Me Good\" was a Top 50 hit on Billboard's Top 100 Singles chart. Trixter did their first-ever arena shows opening for Poison and then headed out on a five-month North American tour with the German rockers Scorpions. In February, the band flew to Daytona, Florida to do MTV's Spring Break and their debut album went Gold soon after. In April 1991 Trixter played their hometown Meadowlands Arena, where they were presented with gold albums at a special after-show party. In May they filmed the video for the third single, \"Surrender\". In June 1991 Trixter started the \"Blood, Sweat & Beers\" tour with Warrant and FireHouse. Around this time the popular rock magazine \"Metal Edge\" dedicated an entire issue to the band, \"The Trixter Color Spectacular\". The video and single for \"Surrender\" were released and once again the video went to No. 1 on MTV for two weeks and the single went Top 100 in \"Billboard\".\n\nIn September 1991, the Blood, Sweat & Beers tour was filmed for a pay-per-view special. October marked the end of the Trixter touring cycle for the debut album. In January 1992, Trixter began pre-production on their second album. Also during that time, the band renegotiated their record deal and were signed directly to MCA Records. Trixter chose James \"Jimbo\" Barton of Rush and Queensrÿche fame to produce. Recording for the new album, \"Hear!\", was from April to August 1992.\n\nThe band's second album, \"Hear!\", was released in October 1992 and Trixter began a second North American tour, opening for Kiss. \"Road of a Thousand Dreams\" was released as a radio single. In January 1993, they shot a video for the next single, \"Rockin Horse\", and began a headlining club tour called The \"Hear Club for Men\" tour. \"Hear!\" did well in Japan, so the band was invited over to do two shows: One in Osaka at Moda Hall and the second in Kawasaki at Club Citta. Trixter finished the Hear! tour in late June 1993 at Milwaukee's Summerfest.\n\n\"Hear!\" failed to capture the attention of the MTV mass market, with the Seattle grunge movement fully underway. The band was then dropped by MCA Records and cut its ties with its management.\n\nIn 1994 the band recorded the \"Undercovers\" EP in Steve Brown's home studio. This was a CD of all cover songs that was released in October 1994 on the indie label Backstreet Records. \n\nIn 1999 the band was featured on VH-1's \"Where Are They Now\" and in 2000 they were voted No. 29 on VH-1's \"Top 40 Hair Band Countdown\".\n\nSteve Brown announced on December 1, 2007 that Trixter would be reuniting in 2008 for the Give It to You Good tour. In 2008, Pete Loran called the 2 Music Geeks and discussed Trixter's 2008 touring plans and the production of a new live album.[1] The reunited Trixter played a total of five dates in 2008, beginning with an appearance at the Rocklahoma festival in July and ending with a sold-out headlining performance in November, their first hometown NJ show in over 13 years. On March 27, 2009, Trixter performed at the Crazy Donkey in Farmingdale, New York. Trixter released a new album in 2012 called \"New Audio Machine\".\n\nAfter thirteen years, 2008 had all the members of the \"classic\" lineup on the worldwide concert circuit once again. Since reforming the band has released \"Alive in Japan\", a live concert CD featuring two new songs and a \"Best Of\" CD with all the hits remastered. On November 28, 2008, Trixter returned home to New Jersey for a homecoming show at Dexter's Entertainment Complex in Riverdale, New Jersey. Trixter also appeared on the cover of the \"EC Rocker\" magazine along with a feature story in North Jersey's biggest newspaper, \"The Record\". On February 20, 2009, Trixter and Dokken sold out The Grizzly Rose in Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn 2016 it was disclosed that Trixter would appear at the three-day Rockingham 2016 melodic/hard rock festival, held in Nottingham, United Kingdom. They headlined on Friday 21 October.\n\n\n\n"}

It was written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, and first broadcast on September 29, 1998.\n\nUnder her middle name, \"Anne\", Buffy works as a diner waitress in L.A. She serves Lily and Rickie, a young couple living on the streets, who have just gotten a complementary set of distinctive tattoos. Later that evening Lily approaches Buffy and reveals that she remembers her from an earlier episode, when Lily was known as \"Chanterelle\". As they talk, a man wanders into the street and is nearly hit by a car, only saved by Buffy's quick response. Buffy runs into a man named Ken, who comments on her \"lost\" state and offers to befriend her.\n\nThe next day Lily tells Buffy that Rickie has disappeared. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help find him. In her search, she finds the body of an elderly homeless man with Rickie's tattoo. Buffy reports her findings to Lily, who doesn't believe that the body could be Rickie's. On the street Lily meets Ken, who claims to know Rickie, so she eagerly goes with him. Buffy interrogates a blood bank worker who has been acting suspiciously, and learns that the woman has been giving Ken the names of healthy homeless people who come in to donate blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken has prepared Lily for a \"cleansing,\" which entails stepping into a bath in the floor. Lily hesitates, as the bath looks like black oil. At the door, Buffy attempts to pass herself off as a sinner wanting a new chance, but ends up kicking her way into the building in time to see Lily dragged into the pool. Buffy and Ken wrestle and they both fall in, coming out below in a huge factory. Ken's human mask falls off, revealing him to be a demon. Buffy and Lily are now amongst many other slave laborers of varying ages. Ken tells Buffy and Lily that they are in a hell dimension where time passes very quickly: a hundred years there equals only one day in Los Angeles. Since he only picks people who no one will miss, they will have worked themselves to a used-up death of old age without anyone noticing their absence. He tells Lily that Rickie remembered her, even after he had forgotten his own name. Lily resigns herself to ending up in hell, and accepts her fate passively.\n\nKen lines the captives up and each one is asked, \"Who are you?\" and then bludgeoned unless they answer \"I'm no one.\" When it is Buffy's turn, she says her name with pride and a battle ensues until Ken threatens Lily at knifepoint. Ken delivers a speech, but Lily pushes him off the ledge onto a concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the pool as Buffy dispatches Ken. Once all of the humans are out of the demonic dimension, the pool gateway closes.\n\nBack in her apartment, Buffy packs her bag, ready to return to Sunnydale. She gives Lily her \"Anne\" identity. The episode ends with Buffy being embraced by her relieved mother.\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" described \"Anne\" as \"a very clever meditation on adolescent identity\". The scene where Anne asserts her identity as Buffy was frequently used as a promotional clip for reruns of the series on the FX channel.\n\n"}

He is known for his portrayals of the people and artifacts of the Great Plains in words and pictures, as well as for experimenting with narrative forms.\n\nMorris was born in Central City, Nebraska; his boyhood home is on the National Register of Historic Places. His mother, Grace Osborn Morris, died six days after he was born. His father, William Henry Morris, worked for the Union Pacific Railroad. After Grace's death, Wright was cared for by a nanny, until his father made a trip to Omaha and returned with a young wife, Gertrude. In \"Will's Boy\", Morris states, \"Gertrude was closer to my age than to my father's\". Gertrude hated small-town life, but got along famously with Wright, as they shared many of the same childish tastes (both loved games, movies, and ice cream). In 1919, the family moved to Omaha, where they resided until 1924.\n\nDuring that interlude, Morris spent two summers on his uncle's farm near Norfolk, Nebraska. Photographs of the farm, as well as the real-life characters of Uncle Harry and Aunt Clara, appear in Morris's books.\n\nMorris moved to Chicago in 1924. Later that year, he accompanied his father on a road trip to the west coast that formed the basis for his first novel, \"My Uncle Dudley\". He also lived briefly with his uncle in Texas before enrolling in Pacific Union College in California. He graduated from Pomona College in 1933. He married Mary Ellen Finfrock in 1934; the couple divorced in 1959. He later married Josephine Mary Kantor.\n\nFollowing college, Morris traveled through Europe on a \"wanderjahr,\" which he later fictionalized in \"Cause for Wonder\".\n\nFrom 1944 to 1954, Morris lived in Philadelphia. From 1954–1962, he divided his time between California and Mexico. In 1963, he accepted a teaching position at San Francisco State College. He retired from teaching in 1975.\n\nMorris won the National Book Award for The \"Field of Vision\" in 1956. His final novel, \"Plains Song\" won the American Book Award in 1981.\n\nMorris developed close friendships with several other American authors, most notably John O'Hara and Thornton Wilder, and was a pall bearer at O'Hara's funeral in 1970. He also conducted a weekly correspondence with Scottish author Muriel Spark from 1962 until his death.\n\nMorris died of esophageal cancer in Mill Valley, California in 1998. He is buried in the Chapman Cemetery.\n\n\nMorris received numerous honors in addition to the National Book Awards for \"The Field of Vision\" and \"Plains Song\".\nHe was granted Guggenheim Fellowships in 1942, 1946, and 1954. In 1975, he won the Mari Sandoz Award recognizing \"significant, enduring contribution to the Nebraska book world\". In 1979, he received the Western Literature Association's Distinguished Achievement Award. In 1981, he won the Los Angeles Times' Book Prize Robert Kirsch Award for lifetime achievement. In 1982, a jury of Modern Language Association members selected him for the Common Wealth Award for distinguished service in literature. In 1985, he was one of the inaugural recipients of the Whiting Award. In 1986, he was honored with a Creative Writing Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nThe full archive of Wright Morris photographs is located at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) at the University of Arizona in Tucson, which also manages the copyright of these photographs.\n\nThe Lincoln City Libraries of Lincoln, NE, houses some Morris correspondence and taped interviews in The Gale E.

{"id": "2160116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160116", "title": "German Renaissance", "text": "German Renaissance\n\nThe German Renaissance, part of the Northern Renaissance, was a cultural and artistic movement that spread among German thinkers in the 15th and 16th centuries, which developed from the Italian Renaissance. Many areas of the arts and sciences were influenced, notably by the spread of Renaissance humanism to the various German states and principalities. There were many advances made in the fields of architecture, the arts, and the sciences. Germany produced two developments that were to dominate the 16th century all over Europe: printing and the Protestant Reformation.\n\nOne of the most important German humanists was Konrad Celtis (1459–1508). Celtis studied at Cologne and Heidelberg, and later travelled throughout Italy collecting Latin and Greek manuscripts. Heavily influenced by Tacitus, he used the \"Germania\" to introduce German history and geography. Eventually he devoted his time to poetry, in which he praised Germany in Latin. Another important figure was Johann Reuchlin (1455–1522) who studied in various places in Italy and later taught Greek. He studied the Hebrew language, aiming to purify Christianity, but encountered resistance from the church. \n\nThe most significant German Renaissance artist is Albrecht Dürer especially known for his printmaking in woodcut and engraving, which spread all over Europe, drawings, and painted portraits. Important architecture of this period includes the Landshut Residence, Heidelberg Castle, the Augsburg Town Hall as well as the Antiquarium of the Munich Residenz in Munich, the largest Renaissance hall north of the Alps.\n\nThe Renaissance was largely driven by the renewed interest in classical learning, and was also the result of rapid economic development. At the beginning of the 16th century, Germany (referring to the lands contained within the Holy Roman Empire) was one of the most prosperous areas in Europe despite a relatively low level of urbanization compared to Italy or the Netherlands. It benefited from the wealth of certain sectors such as metallurgy, mining, banking and textiles. More importantly, book-printing developed in Germany, and German printers dominated the new book-trade in most other countries until well into the 16th century. \n\nThe concept of the Northern Renaissance or German Renaissance is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting printing with movable type, a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was first brought to most of Europe, including France and Italy, by Germans. \n\nPrintmaking by woodcut and engraving was already more developed in Germany and the Low Countries than elsewhere in Europe, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, Albrecht Dürer, began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of Michael Wolgemut, who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. Dürer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the Nuremberg Chronicle, published by his godfather Anton Koberger, Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship in 1490, Dürer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. Dürer supported Martin Luther but continued to create Madonnas and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the Protestant Reformation.\nDürer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. Martin Luther had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and Lucas Cranach the Elder, a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of \"Lutheran altarpieces\", mostly showing the Last Supper, some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the Twelve Apostles. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely aniconic influence of Calvinism, and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.\n\nLying somewhat outside these developments is Matthias Grünewald, who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his \"Isenheim Altarpiece\" (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged triptych.\nThe Danube School is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria, including Albrecht Altdorfer, Wolf Huber and Augustin Hirschvogel. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent landscape art in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints. Their religious paintings had an expressionist style somewhat similar to Grünewald's. Dürer's pupils Hans Burgkmair and Hans Baldung Grien worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of witches in a number of enigmatic prints.\n\nHans Holbein the Elder and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, Hans Holbein the Younger was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the \"Dance of Death\" relate to the works of the Little Masters, a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.\n\nThe outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or Dürer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of Northern Mannerism, which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. Hans von Aachen and the Netherlandish Bartholomeus Spranger were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in Vienna and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish Sadeler family of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties.\n\nIn Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. Veit Stoss (d. 1533), Tilman Riemenschneider (d.1531) and Peter Vischer the Elder (d. 1529) were Dürer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.\n\nRenaissance architecture in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Johannes Reuchlin who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the Landshut Residence, the Castle in Heidelberg, Johannisburg Palace in Aschaffenburg, Schloss Weilburg, the City Hall and Fugger Houses in Augsburg and St. Michael in Munich, the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps.\n\nA particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the Weser Renaissance, with prominent examples such as the City Hall of Bremen and the Juleum in Helmstedt.\n\nIn July 1567 the city council of Cologne approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for Cologne City Hall. St Michael in Munich is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by Duke William V of Bavaria between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the Counter Reformation and was inspired by the Church of il Gesù in Rome. The architect is unknown. Many examples of Brick Renaissance buildings can be found in Hanseatic old towns, such as Stralsund, Wismar, Lübeck, Lüneburg, Friedrichstadt and Stade. Notable German Renaissance architects include Friedrich Sustris, Benedikt Rejt, Abraham van den Blocke, Elias Holl and Hans Krumpper.\n\nBorn Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden, Johannes Gutenberg is widely considered the most influential person within the German Renaissance. As a free thinker, humanist, and inventor, Gutenberg also grew up within the Renaissance, but influenced it greatly as well. His best-known invention is the printing press in 1440. Gutenberg's press allowed the humanists, reformists, and others to circulate their ideas. He is also known as the creator of the Gutenberg Bible, a crucial work that marked the start of the Gutenberg Revolution and the age of the printed book in the Western world.\n\nJohann Reuchlin was the most important aspect of world culture teaching within Germany at this time. He was a scholar of both Greek and Hebrew. Graduating, then going on to teach at Basel, he was considered extremely intelligent. Yet after leaving Basel, he had to start copying manuscripts and apprenticing within areas of law. However, he is most known for his work within Hebrew studies. Unlike some other \"thinkers\" of this time, Reuchlin submerged himself into this, even creating a guide to preaching within the Hebrew faith. The book, titled \"De Arte Predicandi\" (1503), is possibly one of his best-known works from this period.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer was at the time, and remains, the most famous artist of the German Renaissance. He was famous across Europe, and greatly admired in Italy, where his work was mainly known through his prints. He successfully integrated an elaborate Northern style with Renaissance harmony and monumentality. Among his best known works are \"Melencolia I\", the \"Four Horsemen\" from his woodcut \"Apocalypse\" series, and \"Knight, Death, and the Devil\". Other significant artists were Lucas Cranach the Elder, the Danube School and the Little Masters.\n\nMartin Luther was a Protestant Reformer who criticized church practices such as selling indulgences, against which he published in his \"Ninety-Five Theses\" of 1517. Luther also translated the Bible into German, making the Christian scriptures more accessible to the general population and inspiring the standardization of the German language.\n\n"}
{"id": "2160126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160126", "title": "Bombay Talkies", "text": "Bombay Talkies\n\nBombay Talkies was a movie studio founded in 1934. During its period of operation, Bombay Talkies produced 40 movies in Malad, a suburb of the Indian city of Bombay.\n\nThe studio was established in 1934 by Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani. After Rai's death in 1940, Rani took over the studio. Besides the founders, Ashok Kumar was the leading actor of the studio until 1943, when he founded another studio, Filmistan, with Shashadhar Mukherjee. After Rani's retirement, Kumar and Mukherjee took over Bombay Talkies. The company went out of business in 1953. A last film produced by the studio was released in June 1954.\n\nFor the period in cinematic history it represented, Bombay Talkies was considered to be an innovative and highly resourced movie studio. In line with international standards, the studios' facilities included sound and echo-proof stages, laboratories, editing rooms and a preview theater. The reputation of Bombay Talkies was further enhanced by employing experienced European technicians, the most prominent of whom was Franz Osten.\n\nBombay Talkies set a high technical standard for film making in India and was credited with introducing a level of professionalism to the medium of movie making and acting, reputedly higher than standards set by rival Indian film production companies. Bombay Talkies acquired a reputation for changing the aesthetics and technology traditionally associated with Indian films. It was also renowned for producing films on (then) controversial topics such as those dealing with love between an untouchable lower caste girl and a high caste Hindu Brahmin boy e.g. (\"Achhut Kanya\").\n\nDevika Rani, who became one of Bombay Talkies' most successful actresses, and India's first film diva, appeared in \"Jawani ki Hawa\" (1935) and \"Jeevan Naiya\" (1936), as well as a number of other highly successful productions by the company. The studio was similarly recognized as having launched the careers of several prominent Indian film industry luminaries including Devika Rani, Ashok Kumar, Leela Chitnis, Mehmood Ali, Madhubala and Dilip Kumar. Madhubala and Dilip Kumar, who co-starred in four Bombay Talkies films, engaged in a long term, highly covert love affair. Raj Kapoor worked as an assistant to Amiya Chakravarty of Bombay Talkies, before becoming a famous director.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the company faced a number of problems. The most significant change for the studio involved Himanshu Rai, the studio's founder, suffering a nervous breakdown which ultimately resulted in his demise. Following the shock caused by his demise, control of the film company passed on to Devika Rani who was appointed as the key producer of the Bombay Talkies studios. Despite, or perhaps because of, her prior experience as an actress, Devika Rani was highly successful in sustaining the production values of the company, and the studio subsequently retained its dominance over the rapidly expanding Indian film industry. The most successful Bombay Talkies films produced during this period included \"Kangan\" and \"Bandhan\", both of which featured Leela Chitnis and Ashok Kumar. In 1943, \"Kismet\" created a local record for the longest continual showing of the same film. The movie continued to run for more than three and half years at the Roxy movie theater in Calcutta, India.\n\nDespite Devika Rani's success as the Bombay Talkies' head producer, in 1943 a rift arose between her and her managers Sashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar. Although reasons for the rift have never been made public and largely remain unclear to film industry observers, Sashadhar Mukheerjee and Ashok Kumar allegedly attempted to begin their own production house under the guise of Bombay Talkies. Despite Devika Rani, Sashadhar Mukherjee, and Ashok Kumar attempting to create a working relationship which involved alternating production of major films between the two rival production camps, the relationship proved untenable and was fraught with allegations of sabotage, dramatic ego clashes, in-fighting, and the relentless circulation of malicious rumors.\n\nNegotiations between Devika Rani on the one hand and Sashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar on the other failed to unite the company. Shashdhar Mukherjee, Ashok Kumar and a few others left the company in 1943 to found Filmistan. In 1945, Devika Rani married the Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich, sold her Bombay Talkies shares and left the industry. After several attempts to reunite the studio, it was sold to Tolaram Jalan, a businessman, who decided to cease its operations in 1953.\n\n\n"}

The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish, in clusters; the fruit is a small dark blue grape 5–10 mm diameter.\n\nThe specific epithet \"tricuspidata\" means three-pointed, referring to the leaf shape.\n\nLike the related Virginia creeper, this plant is widely grown as a climbing ornamental plant to cover the façades of masonry buildings. This usage is actually economically important because, by shading walls during the summer, it can significantly reduce cooling costs.\n\nBoston Ivy is readily distinguished from the Virginia creeper by its simple leaves with pointed lobes (Virginia creeper leaves are divided into five separate leaflets).\n\nThe plant secretes calcium carbonate, which serves as an adhesive pad and gives it the ability to attach itself to a wall without requiring any additional support. While it does not penetrate the building surface but merely attaches to it, nevertheless damage can occur from attempting to rip the plant from the wall. However, if the plant is killed first, such as by severing the vine from the root, the adhesive pads will eventually deteriorate to the point where the plant can be easily removed without causing any damage to the wall.\n\nIt is used on the brick outfield walls at Wrigley Field of the Chicago Cubs along with Japanese bittersweet. \n\nCultivars include 'Veitchii'.\n\n\"Parthenocissus\" is derived from the Greek terms (; 'maidenly, chaste, virgin') and (; 'vine') and means approximately 'virgin ivy' (hence the common name 'Virginia creeper'). \"Tricuspidata\" means approximately 'with three points' comes from the Greek and Latin prefix ('three') and the Latin ('tipped, pointed').\n"}
{"id": "2160163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160163", "title": "Topeng dance", "text": "Topeng dance\n\nTopeng (Indonesian for \"mask\") is a dramatic form of Indonesian dance in which one or more mask-wearing, ornately costumed performers interpret traditional narratives concerning fabled kings, heroes and myths, accompanied by gamelan music.\n\nIndonesian masked dance predates Hindu-Buddhist influences. Native Indonesian tribes still perform traditional masked-dances to represent nature, as the Hudoq dance of the Dayak people of Kalimantan, or to represent ancestor spirits. With the arrival of Hinduism in the archipelago, the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" epics began to be performed in masked-dance. The most popular storyline of \"topeng\" dance, however, derived from the locally developed Javanese Panji cycles, based on the tales and romance of Prince Panji and Princess Chandra Kirana, set in the 12th-century Kadiri kingdom.\n\nOne of the earliest written records of \"topeng\" dance is found in the 14th-century poem \"Nagarakretagama\", which describes King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit — wearing a golden mask — as an accomplished \"topeng\" dancer. The current \"topeng\" dance form arose in the 15th century in Java and Bali where it remains prevalent, but it is also found in other Indonesian islands — such as Madura (near East Java). Various \"topeng\" dances and styles have developed in various places in the Indonesian archipelago, notably in Cirebon, Yogyakarta, Malang and Bali. The well-developed \"topeng\" technique is now studied in universities in Europe and America.\n\nIt is believed that the use of masks is related to the cult of the ancestors, which considered dancers the interpreters of the gods. \"Topeng\" performances open with a series of non-speaking masked characters which may not be related to the story to be performed. These traditional masks often include \"Topeng Manis\" (a refined hero), \"Topeng Kras\" (a martial, authoritarian character), and \"Topeng Tua\" (an old man who may joke and draw out the audience).\n\nThe story is narrated from a \"penasar\", a jawless half-mask that enables the actor to speak clearly. In group \"topeng\", there are usually two \"penasars\" providing two points of view. The performance alternates between speaking and non-speaking characters, and can include dance and fight sequences as well as special effects (sometimes provided by the gamelan). It is almost always wrapped up by a series of comic characters introducing their own views. The narrators and comic characters frequently break Western conventions of storytelling by including current events or local gossip to get a laugh.\n\nIn \"topeng\", there is a conscious attempt to include many, sometimes contradictory, aspects of the human experience: the sacred and the profane, beauty and ugliness, refinement and caricature. A detailed description and analysis of \"topeng pajegan\", the one-man form of \"topeng\", is available in \"Masked Performance\" by John Emigh, a Western theater professor who has become a performer of Balinese \"topeng\".\n\nCirebon mask dance or \"tari topeng Cirebon\" is a local indigenous art form of Cirebon in Java, including Indramayu and Jatibarang, West Java and Brebes, Central Java. There is a lot of variety in Cirebon mask dance, both in terms of the dance style and the stories to be conveyed. The mask dance can be performed by solo dancers or it can be performed by several people. Graceful hand and body movements, and musical accompaniment dominated by drums and fiddle, are hallmarks of the art form. Cirebon mask dance might depict the story of Prince Panji from 15th-century East Java, or another Majapahit story. \"Topeng Klana Kencana Wungu\" is a Cirebon mask dance in the Parahyangan mask style that depicts the story of Queen Kencana Wungu of Majapahit being chased by the grotesque and rough King Minak Jingga of Blambangan. The Sundanese \"topeng Kandaga\" dance is similar to and influenced by Cirebon \"topeng\", where the dancers wear red masks and costumes.\n\nIn East Java, \"topeng\" dance is called \"wayang gedog\" and is the best known art form from East Java's Malang Regency. \"Wayang gedog\" theatrical performances include themes from the Panji cycle stories from the kingdom of Janggala, and the players wear masks known as \"wayang topeng\" or \"wayang gedog\". The word \"gedog\" comes from \"kedok\" which, like \"topeng\", means \"mask\".\n\nThese performances center on a love story about Princess Candra Kirana of Kediri and Raden Panji Asmarabangun, the legendary crown prince of Janggala. Candra Kirana was the incarnation of Dewi Ratih (the Hindu goddess of love) and Panji was an incarnation of Kamajaya (the Hindu god of love). Kirana's story has been given the title \"Smaradahana\" (\"The fire of love\"). At the end of the complicated story they finally marry and bring forth a son named Raja Putra.\n\nIn Yogyakarta tradition, the mask dance is part of \"wayang wong\" performances. Composed and created by Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1755–1792), certain characters such as the \"wanara\" (monkey) and \"denawa\" (giant) in \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\" use masks, while the knight and princesses do not wear masks. The \"punakawan\" (jester) might use a half-mask (a mask without a jaw) so he can speak freely and clearly. Significantly here, the mustache is painted in black. The Topeng Klono Alus, Topeng Klono Gagah, and Topeng Putri Kenakawulan dances are classical Yogyakarta court dances derived from the story of Raden Panji from the 15th-century Majapahit legacy. The Klono Alus Jungkungmandeya and Klono Gagah Dasawasisa are masked dances adapted from \"Mahabharata\" stories.\n\nThe \"topeng\" of the Surakarta Sunanate court is similar in style and theme to the Yogyakarta variants. Differences are seen in the craftmanship of masks; facial hair is represented with hair or fibre, while the Yogyakarta style uses black paint. Similarly to Yogyakarta, the Sukarta \"topeng punakawan\" (jester) often uses a jawless half-mask.\n\nBetawi mask dance or \"tari topeng Betawi\" is a mask-dance of the Betawi people of Jakarta.\n\n\n"}

Since 1996, he has released 15 studio albums, as well as several live albums and EPs, spanning various genres including swing music, indie rock, and folk music. He is primarily known for his unique style of violin playing, accompanied by loop and effect pedals, whistling, and voice. In the '90s, he sang and played violin in several jazz ensembles, including Squirrel Nut Zippers and Kevin O'Donnell's Quality Six. He went on to start his own swing ensemble, Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, which released three albums between 1998 and 2001. Weather Systems (2003) was his first solo album, and a departure from jazz music into indie music.\n\nBeyond his own record releases, he has collaborated with various artists, including The Handsome Family, Dosh, and Nora O'Connor.\n\nHe has also had a career in film, as a soundtrack composer as well as an actor. He appeared as \"Dr. Stringz\" in a 2007 episode of Jack's Big Music Show. In 2010, he appeared on a TED Talk performing his music. He wrote and performed \"The Whistling Caruso\" for \"The Muppets\" movie in 2011, and composed the score for the television series \"Baskets\", released in 2016. In 2019, Andrew Bird was cast for the fourth season of \"Fargo\", playing, \"a character, written specifically for him, named 'Thurman Smutney.'\" In 2020 he released a \"Meditative Story\" about the musical turning point in his life that led up to making Weather Systems, scored with original music. \n\nTrained in the Suzuki method from the age of four, Bird graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1991 and Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in violin performance in 1996. That same year he self-released his first solo album, \"Music of Hair\". Vastly different from his later work, this album showcased his violin skills and paid tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues. Following this, his initial commercial exposure came through collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers, appearing on three of their albums (\"Hot\", \"Sold Out\", and \"Perennial Favorites\") between 1996 and 1998.\n\nTaking on the role of bandleader, Bird released \"Thrills\" on Rykodisc in 1998 with his group Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, shortly followed by second album \"Oh! The Grandeur\" in 1999. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz, and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument, as well as providing vocals along with his trademark verbose lyrics. The Bowl of Fire featured musicians from Bird's home town of Chicago, including Kevin O'Donnell, Joshua Hirsch, Jon Williams, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins, Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn, and Ryan Hembrey. During this period, Andrew Bird was a member of the jazz group Kevin O'Donnells Quality Six, for which he was the lead singer and violinist and contributed to arrangements and songwriting for the albums \"Heretic Blues\" (Delmark 1999) and \"Control Freak\" (Delmark 2000) (both Delmark albums were produced by Raymond Salvatore Harmon).\n\nIn 2001, the Bowl of Fire released their third album, \"The Swimming Hour\", a dramatic departure from their previous recordings. It featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced \"Core and Rind\" to more straightforward rock songs such as \"11:11\". Due to this eclectic nature, Bird has often referred to it as his \"jukebox album\". Although gaining critical praise (\"The Swimming Hour\" received a 9.0 from indie music website Pitchfork), the band failed to attain commercial success or recognition, playing to audiences as small as 40 people. In 2002, Bird was asked to open for a band in his hometown of Chicago, but fellow Bowl of Fire members were unavailable for the date. The reluctant Bird performed the gig alone, and the surprising success of this solo show suggested potential new directions for his music.\n\nThe Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded in 2003, and Bird went on to radically re-invent himself as a solo artist. His two subsequent albums were released on Ani Difranco's Righteous Babe Records label. 2003's \"Weather Systems\" (originally released on Grimsey Records) was a sparse record with a dramatic change in musical direction. It featured the tracks \"Skin\" and \"I\", proto-versions of songs that would later become \"Skin, Is My\" (\"The Mysterious Production of Eggs\") and \"Imitosis\" (\"Armchair Apocrypha\"). On May 10, 2004 Andrew appeared on the Woodsongs Old-Time Radio Hour where he performed \"First Song\" and \"Action Adventure\" both from the Weather Systems album. He discussed and demonstrated looping, which was how he could perform solo and still have a fully finished sound.\n\n\"The Mysterious Production of Eggs\" (2005) continued a progression towards an eclectic indie–folk sound, and both records formed a stark stylistic break with Bird's earlier work, swapping the lush backing of a full band for carefully layered samples of sound constructed using multitrack recorders and loop pedals. As his sound changed, Bird made increasing use of guitar, glockenspiel, and whistling in his songwriting, in addition to his traditional violin and vocals.\n\nBird is noted for improvising and reworking his songs during live performance, as can be seen in his series of self-released live compilations entitled \"Fingerlings\", \"Fingerlings 2\", \"Fingerlings 3\", and \"Fingerlings 4\", the first of which was released in 2002. Each \"Fingerlings\" EP was released prior to a studio album, and presented a mixture of live performances from different shows, including old tracks, covers, and previously unreleased songs, some of which have since appeared on studio albums. \"Fingerlings 3\", released in October 2006, also featured studio outtakes. Fingerlings 2 provided Bird with an unexpected boost in recognition in 2004 when it was named album of the month by \"Mojo\".\n\nIn 2005, co-collaborator Martin Dosh joined Bird's line-up, adding percussion and keyboards to his sound. Jeremy Ylvisaker was later added to the group on bass and backup vocals.\n\nIn September 2006, Bird signed to Fat Possum Records, and in March 2007 he released his third post-Bowl of Fire album, \"Armchair Apocrypha\". The album was recorded in collaboration with electronic musician Martin Dosh, and includes a track composed by Dosh (with lyrics by Bird) entitled \"Simple X\". This song first appeared without Bird's lyrics as \"Simple Exercises\" on Dosh's 2004 release \"Pure Trash\". The album was produced by Ben Durrant (who had worked on Dosh's \"The Lost Take\"), and also featured Haley Bonar and Chris Morrissey. In advance of the March release date, \"Armchair Apocrypha\" was leaked to the Internet in January 2007. The album went on to sell over 100,000 copies.\n\nAs publicity for \"Armchair Apocrypha\", Bird made his network television debut on April 10, 2007, performing \"Plasticities\" (from the new album) on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". He also appeared on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" on June 14, 2007, performing \"Imitosis\" from the same album. In April 2007, he did a \"Take-Away Show\" acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. These appearances were accompanied by an extensive tour, which ended with sell-out performances at the Beacon Theater, New York and the Orpheum Theater, Los Angeles.\n\nIn January 2007, Bird made an appearance on the Noggin television network's \"Jack's Big Music Show\", playing the part of Dr. Stringz and appearing in order to mend a character's broken dulcimer. Bird sang a brief song called \"Dr. Stringz\", written specially for the show. He now often plays it live as an introduction to the song \"Fake Palindromes\".\n\nOn May 20, 2007, National Public Radio aired a live concert by Bird from Washington, D.C.'s He also worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for his 2007 spring tour.\n\nFive of his songs – \"Banking on a Myth\" from \"The Mysterious Production of Eggs,\" a medley of \"I\" from \"Weather Systems\" and \"Imitosis\" from \"Armchair Apocrypha,\" and \"Skin\" and \"Weather Systems\" from \"Weather Systems\" – have been licensed for use by Marriott Residence Inn.\n\nSince March 2008, Bird has contributed to \"Measure for Measure,\" a \"New York Times\" blog in which musicians write about their songwriting process. In it, he has charted the development of the song \"Oh No,\" previewing samples at various stages of development through to the finished album recording. He also discussed the conception of the song \"Natural Disaster,\" the recording of instrumental piece \"Hot Math,\" and previewed \"Master Sigh.\" The first two songs were later released on Bird's 2009 album \"Noble Beast\", whilst the latter two appeared on its bonus disc \"Useless Creatures\". \"Oh No\" was featured in the show Billions.\n\nIn November 2008, he appeared in the second series of Nigel Godrich's \"From the Basement\" alongside Radiohead and Fleet Foxes. His performance included a preview of new song \"Section 8 City,\" a ten-minute re-imagining of \"Sectionate City,\" which originally appeared on the \"Soldier on\" EP.\n\nBird's fifth solo album, \"Noble Beast,\" was released on January 20, 2009, and contained fourteen new songs, with bonus tracks available for download from iTunes and eMusic. \"The Privateers\" is a re-imagining of a very early song entitled \"The Confession\" from 1999's \"Oh! The Grandeur.\" A limited deluxe edition of the album included alternate packaging and artwork, as well as an all-instrumental companion disc entitled \"Useless Creatures.\" The entirety of \"Useless Creatures\" was made available via Bird's website during the run-up to the release. \"Noble Beast\" has been met with generally favourable reviews, receiving a score of 79 out of 100 from review collation site Metacritic.\n\nIn 2009, he contributed a cover of the song \"The Giant of Illinois\" to the HIV and AIDS benefit album \"Dark Was the Night\" produced by the Red Hot Organization. On May 11, 2009, Bird released the EP \"Fitz and the Dizzy Spells.\" It contains \"Fitz and the Dizzyspells\" from \"Noble Beast,\" as well as other songs from that album's recording sessions. Some of the songs on the EP were previously available for download from iTunes and eMusic as bonus tracks to \"Noble Beast.\"\n\nIn 2010, Bird recorded with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, contributing vocals and violin on a cover of \"Shake It and Break It\" on \"Preservation: An Album to Benefit Preservation Hall & The Preservation Hall Music Outreach Program.\" In August 2010, Bird contributed a charity T-shirt to the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for the Pegasus Special Riders Fund, which provides therapeutic horse riding activities for adults and children with special needs.\n\nIn late 2011 Bird signed to the record label Mom + Pop Music. Andrew Bird's first release for the label was the soundtrack to the film Norman, which included his original score as well as songs by other artists. Bird sequenced the soundtrack to flow as a stand-alone album rather than a compilation of music from the film. Its music supervisor, Peymon Maskan, told HitQuarters: \"The best compliment I've heard is that without having seen the film, you can imagine it by listening to the soundtrack. The sequence is a big part of that effect.\"\n\nOn December 6, Bird announced a new album \"Break it Yourself\", the follow up to 2009's \"Noble Beast\".\n\nIn 2011 \"Andrew Bird: Fever Year\", a feature-length concert documentary on Bird's year-long tour, had its World Premiere at Lincoln Center with the prestigious New York Film Festival. The film's festival-only run closed in 2013 after screening in over ninety international festivals and winning nine awards. \"Fever Year\" depicts Bird and his band during final months of a tour during which he reportedly suffered from constant fever. When asked on her website if the film will be released on DVD, director Xan Aranda stated that the film was commissioned by and belongs to Bird, thus the release is up to him to decide. \"Andrew Bird: Fever Year\" also features Martin Dosh, Michael Lewis, Jeremy Ylvisaker, and St. Vincent (Annie Clark).\n\nIn September 2012, Bird announced \"Hands Of Glory\", a companion EP to \"Break it Yourself\". The album was released on October 30.\n\nIn 2014, Andrew Bird's song \"Pulaski at Night\" was featured in the second-season premiere episode of \"Orange Is the New Black\". \"Pulaski at Night\" was also featured in the first season of Paolo Sorrentino's \"The Young Pope\".\n\nOn June 10, 2014, Andrew Bird released his album \"Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of…\", an album of covers of The Handsome Family and Bird's first record that does not contain any of his own compositions.\n\nOn April 1, 2016, Bird released his tenth solo album, \"Are You Serious\" with Loma Vista Recordings. The album featured guest vocals from Fiona Apple and includes Bird's earlier track, \"Pulaski at Night\", now renamed \"Pulaski.\" A total of 6 songs from the album have been released as singles as of August 2017.\n\nAndrew Bird toured in support of \"Are You Serious\" through much of 2016 and 2017.\n\nHe appeared in episode 14 of the Hulu series \"The Path\", February 8, 2017, playing \"Roma Fade\" as part of a \"private concert\".\n\nOn Nov. 2, 2018, he released the single “Bloodless” backed with \"Capital Crimes\".\n\nOn March 22, 2019, Bird released \"My Finest Work Yet\" via Loma Vista Recordings. The album features singles “Sisyphus” and “Manifest”. My Finest Work Yet was recorded live to tape at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, CA. Produced by Paul Butler, Bird and the band went for a Rudy Van Gelder jazz room sound where the instruments bleed into all the mics in just the right way. Piano plays a strong role on these songs and most of the melodies are tinged with a gospel-jazz-60s soul feel while the lyrics are direct and risk-taking, cutting to the quick of what’s happening in our world. The album includes a previous single, “Bloodless,” which debuted in November 2018.\n\nGrowing up, Bird was surrounded by classical music. As a child, he was interested in Irish tunes and bluegrass. He also cites English and Scottish folk music as an early influence. His early jazz influences were Johnny Hodges, Lester Young, and Fats Waller. He has also had a number of classical influences such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Béla Bartók. Other influences included jazz, swing, calypso, and folk. Bird has stated that, at 22, he found a lot of indie rock and pop music repetitive and boring, but now understands it better.\n\nAndrew Bird appears to have a close relationship with The Handsome Family, an Americana band from Illinois. Covers of their songs have appeared in several of his albums, including \"When The Helicopter Comes,\" on \"Hands of Glory\", \"Tin Foiled,\" on \"Fingerlings 3\", and \"Don't Be Scared,\" from \"Weather Systems\". His album, \"Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of…\" is a ten-song cover album, with a strong country feeling.\n\nThe album's liner notes contain a response from Rennie Sparks, the band's lyricist and singer: \"Hearing Andrew's version of our songs feels like suddenly spotting a new and shining doorway in the midst of a room I have spent my life in. It's like finding a stairway in the forest leading upward to the sky. His recasting of our work gives me the strange and wonderful pleasure of understanding my own songs better by hearing him perform them.\"\n\nOne of Bird's primary instruments is a violin which he acquired when he was 16. His \"first serious violin,\" it was custom made by a Polish luthier in Chicago, and Bird had to audition to prove he was worthy of playing it. In 2017, following the release of \"Are You Serious\", he commissioned Peter Seman to build a 5-string violin. The custom instrument features a lower C string (giving it the range of a viola), a unique scroll which bends backwards, and has no corners.\n\nFor looping, Andrew Bird uses two Line 6 DL4 delay pedals: one for rhythmic pizzicato, and the other, \"is dedicated to the ambient bowed strings.\" The DL4, on top of being able to loop, can also slow down and speed up loops, lowering or raising the pitch of a recording by an octave in the process. This feature occurs in many of Bird's songs, as well as live performances. He also uses an octave pedal to give the violin the range of a bass.\n\nHe began using loop pedals to compensate when performing alone on stage, but later found that looping helped him to \"embrace repetition,\" and compose his songs in a more straightforward manner, since he felt his writing style was too chaotic.\n\nBird does not have a regular band that he plays with, and personnel changes with each album. Throughout his career, he has performed with a rotating cast of musicians. However, some musicians have appeared on several different albums, and performed with Andrew Bird on multiple tours.\n\n\nOriginally \"supposed to be a lark, kind of a between records thing,\", the Hands of Glory was an old time band started by Andrew Bird. The group toured and recorded one eponymous album under the name in 2012.\n\n\nAndrew Bird currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife Katherine and their son Sam.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It expands upon and replaces an earlier soft-cover rulebook entitled \"Tome and Blood\".\n\n\"Complete Arcane\" presents additional rules and advice for the creation and use of character classes which specialize in arcane magic, which represents magic that is learned through research or inherent power as opposed to divine sources.\n\nThe Complete Arcane introduces three new base classes to the 3rd edition game.\n\nA Warlock has been given supernatural powers; either he or his ancestors made a deal with a supernatural being. A warlock has an innate magical ability called the \"eldritch blast\", a damaging ray-like ability. The damage for this attack increases as the warlock gains levels. Instead of spells, warlocks gain a limited number of \"invocations\", spell-like abilities with a distinctively sinister flavor. Most of these invocations may be performed at will, or have durations of 24 hours. Some invocations add effects to the warlock's eldritch blast, causing sicknesss, or blindness, or fright, etc.\n\nWarmages take the concept of \"magical artillery\" to its extreme. They specialize in direct-damage spells and can wear light armor (and later medium armor) without penalty to their spellcasting. Though they cast spells like a sorcerer, they have a very limited list of spells they can cast.\n\nWu jen are arcane spellcasters with a distinct Oriental flavor. Wu Jen specialize in the casting of elemental spells. The five elements of Wu Jen magic are wood, fire, water, earth, and metal.\n\nPrestige classes are mainly updates from Tome & Blood.\n\n\"Complete Arcane\" also introduces a number of metamagic feats and several others based on magic, including the Mage Slayer feat tree, which makes a character more dangerous to arcane casters.\n\nMagic items include variant forms for potions and scrolls such as ceramic tiles that are broken to cause a spell effect instead of liquids that must be consumed, as well as spellbook materials for the discerning (or paranoid) wizard.\n\nThe last chapter of the book details how arcane magic can affect a campaign world, including the uses and abuses of Enchantment spells, flight, teleportation, and invisibility, and how nonmagical people would react to bards, sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks.\n\n\"Complete Arcane\" was written by Richard Baker and published in November 2004. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steve Belledin, Matt Cavotta, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Emily Fiegenschuh, Doug Kovacs, Ginger Kubic, Jeff Miracola, Monte Moore, William O'Connor, Michael Phillippi, Ron Spencer, and Franz Vohwinkel.\n\nRich Baker described his creative process on the book: \"I don't know if I have any one global process for thinking up new stuff. I can offer a little insight into how I derived some of our new material, though. If you look at the various schools of magic, you'll see that Abjuration really gets short shrift in most of our sourcebooks. So, I was determined to look hard at Abjuration spells and see if I couldn't re-envision the abjurer a little bit to make it cooler. It occurred to me that abjuration was the school of magic manipulating magic (for example, dispel magic) . . . which means that abjurers really ought to be the nastiest spell-duelists out there. If you want to build a wizard who specializes in gunslinging against other wizards, Abjuration should be your specialty. That's a pretty cool take on a school of magic that was formerly a little boring and overlooked, so I ran with it. I created a half-dozen key new Abjuration spells to support that vision, spells that screw with the other wizard's defenses and use your enemy's magic against him.\"\n\n"}

The slogan of the Wasatch Run is \"One Hundred Miles of Heaven and Hell.\"\n\nWasatch began in 1980 as a challenge for five local runners who were inspired by the Western States, the first of modern-day western 100s. The following year seven runners competed but no one finished. By 1990 the race began regularly hosting more than 100 runners and the number of runners increased to 321 in 2014.\n\nWasatch gains cumulatively 24,000 feet in elevation as it traverses the Wasatch Front, commanding vistas of basin and range country, the Great Salt Lake, steep canyons, broad plateaus, and craggy peaks. The course begins east of Kaysville and follows the top of the Wasatch Range before ending in Soldier Hollow. Altitude ranges from 4,700 to 10,460 feet, and temperatures range from 80s in the shade during the day to 20s on the high ridges at night. September weather in Utah can vary widely. Some years heat is a major factor, while in 2010 runners negotiated fresh snow for four miles in the early stages of the race. The fastest runners typically finish the race in 20 hours or so, while the field is given 36 hours to finish the race.\n\nFor many years Wasatch was regarded as the toughest 100-miler, but with the advent of the Hardrock 100 in Colorado, this has been thrown into some dispute. Some advocates for Wasatch note that Hardrock has a 48-hour cutoff, and therefore is in a different category of event (a quasi multi-day). Both races are undeniably very difficult and pose their own challenges.\n\nGeoff Roes holds the men's course record with a finish time of 18:30:55 in 2009.

{"id": "2160183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160183", "title": "Data recovery", "text": "Data recovery\n\nIn computing, data recovery is a process of salvaging (retrieving) inaccessible, lost, corrupted, damaged or formatted data from secondary storage, removable media or files, when the data stored in them cannot be accessed in a normal way. The data is most often salvaged from storage media such as internal or external hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, magnetic tapes, CDs, DVDs, RAID subsystems, and other electronic devices. Recovery may be required due to physical damage to the storage devices or logical damage to the file system that prevents it from being mounted by the host operating system (OS).\n\nThe most common data recovery scenario involves an operating system failure, malfunction of a storage device, logical failure of storage devices, accidental damage or deletion, etc. (typically, on a single-drive, single-partition, single-OS system), in which case the ultimate goal is simply to copy all important files from the damaged media to another new drive. This can be easily accomplished using a Live CD or DVD by booting directly from a ROM instead of the corrupted drive in question. Many Live CDs or DVDs provide a means to mount the system drive and backup drives or removable media, and to move the files from the system drive to the backup media with a file manager or optical disc authoring software. Such cases can often be mitigated by disk partitioning and consistently storing valuable data files (or copies of them) on a different partition from the replaceable OS system files.\n\nAnother scenario involves a drive-level failure, such as a compromised file system or drive partition, or a hard disk drive failure. In any of these cases, the data is not easily read from the media devices. Depending on the situation, solutions involve repairing the logical file system, partition table or master boot record, or updating the firmware or drive recovery techniques ranging from software-based recovery of corrupted data, hardware- and software-based recovery of damaged service areas (also known as the hard disk drive's \"firmware\"), to hardware replacement on a physically damaged drive which allows for extraction of data to a new drive. If a drive recovery is necessary, the drive itself has typically failed permanently, and the focus is rather on a one-time recovery, salvaging whatever data can be read.\n\nIn a third scenario, files have been accidentally \"deleted\" from a storage medium by the users. Typically, the contents of deleted files are not removed immediately from the physical drive; instead, references to them in the directory structure are removed, and thereafter space the deleted data occupy is made available for later data overwriting. In the mind of end users, deleted files cannot be discoverable through a standard file manager, but the deleted data still technically exists on the physical drive. In the meantime, the original file contents remain, often in a number of disconnected fragments, and may be recoverable if not overwritten by other data files.\n\nThe term \"data recovery\" is also used in the context of forensic applications or espionage, where data which have been encrypted or hidden, rather than damaged, are recovered. Sometimes data present in the computer gets encrypted or hidden due to reasons like virus attack which can only be recovered by some computer forensic experts.\n\nA wide variety of failures can cause physical damage to storage media, which may result from human errors and natural disasters. CD-ROMs can have their metallic substrate or dye layer scratched off; hard disks can suffer from a multitude of mechanical failures, such as head crashes, PCB failure and failed motors; tapes can simply break.\n\nPhysical damage to a hard drive, even in cases where a head crash has occurred, does not necessarily mean there will be permanent loss of data. The techniques employed by many professional data recovery companies can typically salvage most, if not all, of the data that had been lost when the failure occurred.\n\nOf course there are exceptions to this, such as cases where severe damage to the hard drive platters may have occurred. However, if the hard drive can be repaired and a full image or clone created, then the logical file structure can be rebuilt in most instances.\n\nMost physical damage cannot be repaired by end users. For example, opening a hard disk drive in a normal environment can allow airborne dust to settle on the platter and become caught between the platter and the read/write head. During normal operation, read/write heads float 3 to 6 nanometers above the platter surface, and the average dust particles found in a normal environment are typically around 30,000 nanometers in diameter. When these dust particles get caught between the read/write heads and the platter, they can cause new head crashes that further damage the platter and thus compromise the recovery process. Furthermore, end users generally do not have the hardware or technical expertise required to make these repairs. Consequently, data recovery companies are often employed to salvage important data with the more reputable ones using class 100 dust- and static-free cleanrooms.\n\nRecovering data from physically damaged hardware can involve multiple techniques. Some damage can be repaired by replacing parts in the hard disk. This alone may make the disk usable, but there may still be logical damage. A specialized disk-imaging procedure is used to recover every readable bit from the surface. Once this image is acquired and saved on a reliable medium, the image can be safely analyzed for logical damage and will possibly allow much of the original file system to be reconstructed.\n\nA common misconception is that a damaged printed circuit board (PCB) may be simply replaced during recovery procedures by an identical PCB from a healthy drive. While this may work in rare circumstances on hard disk drives manufactured before 2003, it will not work on newer drives. Electronics boards of modern drives usually contain drive-specific adaptation data (generally a map of bad sectors and tuning parameters) and other information required to properly access data on the drive. Replacement boards often need this information to effectively recover all of the data. The replacement board may need to be reprogrammed. Some manufacturers (Seagate, for example) store this information on a serial EEPROM chip, which can be removed and transferred to the replacement board.\n\nEach hard disk drive has what is called a \"system area\" or \"service area\"; this portion of the drive, which is not directly accessible to the end user, usually contains drive's firmware and adaptive data that helps the drive operate within normal parameters. One function of the system area is to log defective sectors within the drive; essentially telling the drive where it can and cannot write data.\n\nThe sector lists are also stored on various chips attached to the PCB, and they are unique to each hard disk drive. If the data on the PCB do not match what is stored on the platter, then the drive will not calibrate properly. In most cases the drive heads will click because they are unable to find the data matching what is stored on the PCB.\n\nThe term \"logical damage\" refers to situations in which the error is not a problem in the hardware and requires software-level solutions.\n\nIn some cases, data on a hard disk drive can be unreadable due to damage to the partition table or file system, or to (intermittent) media errors. In the majority of these cases, at least a portion of the original data can be recovered by repairing the damaged partition table or file system using specialized data recovery software such as Testdisk; software like dd rescue can image media despite intermittent errors, and image raw data when there is partition table or file system damage. This type of data recovery can be performed by people without expertise in drive hardware as it requires no special physical equipment or access to platters.\n\nSometimes data can be recovered using relatively simple methods and tools; more serious cases can require expert intervention, particularly if parts of files are irrecoverable. Data carving is the recovery of parts of damaged files using knowledge of their structure.\n\nAfter data has been physically overwritten on a hard disk drive, it is generally assumed that the previous data are no longer possible to recover. In 1996, Peter Gutmann, a computer scientist, presented a paper that suggested overwritten data could be recovered through the use of magnetic force microscopy. In 2001, he presented another paper on a similar topic. To guard against this type of data recovery, Gutmann and Colin Plumb designed a method of irreversibly scrubbing data, known as the Gutmann method and used by several disk-scrubbing software packages.\n\nSubstantial criticism has followed, primarily dealing with the lack of any concrete examples of significant amounts of overwritten data being recovered. Although Gutmann's theory may be correct, there is no practical evidence that overwritten data can be recovered, while research has shown to support that overwritten data cannot be recovered.\n\nSolid-state drives (SSD) overwrite data differently from hard disk drives (HDD) which makes at least some of their data easier to recover. Most SSDs use flash memory to store data in pages and blocks, referenced by logical block addresses (LBA) which are managed by the flash translation layer (FTL). When the FTL modifies a sector it writes the new data to another location and updates the map so the new data appear at the target LBA. This leaves the pre-modification data in place, with possibly many generations, and recoverable by data recovery software.\n\nSometimes, data present in the physical drives (Internal/External Hard disk, Pen Drive, etc.) gets lost, deleted and formatted due to circumstances like virus attack, accidental deletion or accidental use of SHIFT+DELETE. In these cases, data recovery software are used to recover/restore the data files.\n\nIn the list of logical failures of hard disks, logical bad sector is the most common in which data files cannot be retrieved from a particular sector of the media drives. To resolve this, software is used to correct the logical sectors of the media drive. If this is not enough, the hardware containing the logical bad sectors must be replaced.\n\nRecovery experts do not always need to have physical access to the damaged hardware. When the lost data can be recovered by software techniques, they can often perform the recovery using remote access software over the Internet, LAN or other connection to the physical location of the damaged media. The process is essentially no different from what the end user could perform by themselves.\n\nRemote recovery requires a stable connection with an adequate bandwidth. However, it is not applicable where access to the hardware is required, as in cases of physical damage.\n\nUsually, there are four phases when it comes to successful data recovery, though that can vary depending on the type of data corruption and recovery required.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Windows operating system can be reinstalled on a computer that is already licensed for it. The reinstallation can be done by downloading the operating system or by using a \"restore disk\" provided by the computer manufacturer. Eric Lundgren was fined and sentenced to U.S. federal prison in April 2018 for producing 28,000 restore disks and intending to distribute them for about 25 cents each as a convenience to computer repair shops.\n\nData recovery cannot always be done on a running system. As a result, a boot disk, live CD, live USB, or any other type of live distro contains a minimal operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He produced plays on CJOR Vancouver in the late 1930s and early 1940s. He married Barbara Kelly in 1942, and they moved to Toronto the same year. They had two children, Christopher and Kelly Braden. Seven years later, he, his wife and two children moved to England. A third child, Kim, was born in London in 1949.\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1991, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel outside the Aldwych Theatre.\n\nBraden died in Camden, London, aged 76, following a series of strokes.\n\nIn \"Breakfast with Braden\" (for the BBC, from January 1950) he played American serviceman \"Brandon Marlow\" (a caricature of Marlon Brando in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"). Other cast members acted as stooges, including Pearl Carr (\"Sing, Pearl\"), Benny Lee and bandleader Nat Temple (\"Play, Nat!\").\n\nOther BBC radio shows followed: \"Bedtime with Braden\" (from September 1950), which included his signature sign-out song \"Lullaby of Birdland\"; \"Between Time\"; \"Bathtime\"; and \"Bedlam with Braden\". Ronald Fletcher, the announcer, was drawn into the script which added to the ingenuity and enjoyment.\n\nBraden also appeared in 1951 alongside his wife in \"An Evening at Home with Bernard Braden and Barbara Kelly\".\n\nBraden is probably best remembered for \"On the Braden Beat\", a popular consumer affairs programme made for ITV by Associated Television, which ran from 1962 to 1967. Jock Watson and, later, Francis Coleman produced this Saturday late-night show, which also examined current political issues affecting the British public. The show was interspersed with lighthearted sketches and music, and helped a number of actors to get a start on television. Performers frequently featured included Peter Cook, Jake Thackray and Tim Brooke-Taylor.\n\nA successor with essentially the same format, \"Braden's Week\", appeared when he transferred to the BBC from 1967 to 1972. This show was cancelled when he advertised margarine on the BBC's commercial rival ITV; the BBC felt this was inconsistent with his role as the consumers' spokesman. Esther Rantzen, one of the researcher/presenters, went on to front a similar consumer-focused show, \"That's Life!\". In 1974, Braden also hosted a short-lived Canadian edition of \"The Braden Beat\" for Canada's fledgling Global Television Network.\n\nBraden hosted a quiz show for London Weekend Television in 1976, \"The Sweepstakes Game\". Two contestants decided which of six star guests were most likely to help them to win cash and prizes.\n\nHe later (1987-1989) presented episodes of the show \"All Our Yesterdays\".\n\nBraden independently produced and shot in 1967-68 an extended series of interviews of public figures, conducted by himself (and sometimes by his wife), for a series called \"Now and Then\" but the series was never completed or sold to a broadcaster. The series was re-edited in 2008 as \"Sex Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: The 60s Revealed\", in which the original interviewees saw their 1968 interviews for the first time.\n\nHis few film appearances included \"Love in Pawn\" (1953), \"Jet Storm \" (1959), \"The Full Treatment\" (1960), \"The Day the Earth Caught Fire\" (1961) (as the news editor of the \"Daily Express\"), and the 1962 films \"Two and Two Make Six\" and \"All Night Long\". In the same year he played Flight Surgeon Randall in the British film \"The War Lover\", alongside Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner and a young Michael Crawford.\n\nHe also narrated the 20-minute British Transport Films short \"The Coasts of Clyde\", in which he announces himself as a Canadian traveller arriving in Scotland in pursuit of an ancestor in the land of his parents.\n\nOn the stage he appeared in two Tennessee Williams plays, as Mitch in the London production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", and later as the lead in \"Period of Adjustment\".\n\nBraden published an autobiography, \"The Kindness of Strangers\"; the title is an allusion to \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".\n\n\n"}

Neopentane is a flammable gas at room temperature and pressure which can condense into a highly volatile liquid on a cold day, in an ice bath, or when compressed to a higher pressure.\n\nNeopentane is the simplest alkane with a quaternary carbon, and has achiral tetrahedral symmetry. It is one of the three structural isomers with the molecular formula CH (pentanes), the other two being \"n\"-pentane and isopentane. Out of these three, it is the only one to be a gas at standard conditions; the others are liquids.\n\nThe traditional name neopentane was still retained in the 1993 IUPAC recommendations, but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations. The preferred IUPAC name is the systematic name 2,2-dimethylpropane, but the substituent numbers are superfluous because it is the only possible “dimethylpropane.”\n\nA neopentyl substituent, often symbolized by \"Np\", has the structure MeC-CH- for instance neopentyl alcohol (MeCCHOH or NpOH). As Np also symbolises the element neptunium (atomic number 93) one should use this abbreviation with care.\n\nThe obsolete name tetramethylmethane is also used, especially in older sources.\n\nThe boiling point of neopentane is only 9.5 °C, significantly lower than those of isopentane (27.7 °C) and normal pentane (36.0 °C). Therefore, neopentane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, while the other two isomers are (barely) liquids.\n\nThe melting point of neopentane (−16.6 °C), on the other hand, is 140 degrees higher than that of isopentane (−159.9 °C) and 110 degrees higher than that of \"n\"-pentane (−129.8 °C). This anomaly has been attributed to the better solid-state packing assumed to be possible with the tetrahedral neopentane molecule; but this explanation has been challenged on account of it having a lower density than the other two isomers. Moreover, its enthalpy of fusion is lower than the enthalpies of fusion of both \"n\"-pentane and isopentane, thus indicating that its high melting point is due to an entropy effect resulting from higher molecular symmetry. Indeed, the entropy of fusion of neopentane is about 4 times lower than that of \"n\"-pentane and isopentane.\n\nBecause of neopentane's full tetrahedral symmetry, all protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single NMR chemical shift δ = 0.902 when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride. In this respect, neopentane is similar to its silane analog, tetramethylsilane, whose single chemical shift is zero by convention.\n\nThe symmetry of the neopentane molecule can be broken if some hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms. In particular, if each methyl group has a different number of substituted atoms (0, 1, 2, and 3), one obtains a chiral molecule. The chirality in this case arises solely by the mass distribution of its nuclei, while the electron distribution is still essentially achiral.\n\n"}

{"id": "2160199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160199", "title": "Artistic Dress movement", "text": "Artistic Dress movement\n\nArtistic Dress was a fashion movement in the second half of the nineteenth century that rejected highly structured and heavily trimmed Victorian trends in favour of beautiful materials and simplicity of design. It arguably developed in Britain in the early 1850s, influenced by artistic circles such as the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dress Reform movements. It subsequently developed into more specific categories such as Aesthetic Dress and Künstlerkleid on the continent.\n\nDante Gabriel Rossetti and other members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were conscious archaizers, emulating the work of the \"old masters\" and choosing romantic, medieval subjects. They dressed their models in long flowing gowns loosely inspired by styles of the Middle Ages. These styles were then adopted by the painters' wives and models for everyday dress. Dresses were loosely fitted and comparatively plain, often with long puffed sleeves; they were made from fabric in muted colors derived from natural dyes, and could be ornamented with embroidery in the art needlework style. Artistic dress was an extreme contrast to the tight corsets, hoop skirts and bustles, bright synthetic aniline dyes, and lavish ornamentation seen in the mainstream fashion of the period.\n\nIn the 1860s, artistic dress became popular in intellectual circles and among artists for its natural beauty; it also reinforced their social ideals of quality materials, respect for the work of the hands, and the purity of medieval design.\n\nAesthetic dress of the 1880s and 1890s carries on many of the external characteristics of Artistic dress (rejection of tightlacing in favour of simplicity of line and emphasis on beautiful fabrics), even though, at its core, Aestheticism rejected the moral and social goals of the Victorian dress reform that was its precursor. The Aesthetes' belief that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure was a direct rejection of the reverence for simplicity and handwork propounded by William Morris.\n\nAesthetic dress encompasses a range of modes, from the \"Japonaise\" gowns and Kate Greenaway-inspired children's smocks of Liberty & Co. to the velvet jackets and knee breeches of Oscar Wilde's \"aesthetic lecturing costume\" for his speaking tour of America in 1882. Prominent designers and dressmakers associated with the movement include Ada Nettleship, who designed costumes for Oscar Wilde's wife Constance Lloyd, and Alice Comyns Carr, who was head costume designer for the actor Ellen Terry. Anna Muthesius was a German designer living in London who was annoyed that women were being exploited by clothing industrialists and that to avoid their pronouncements they should decide on their own fabrics and designs. Her 1903 book, \"Das Eigenkleid der Frau\", which incorporated an Art Nouveau binding by Frances MacDonald, is considered an important contribution to the Artistic Dress movement.\n\nFrom artistic circles, artistic and aesthetic dress spread to fashionable ones. The delicate, lightly corseted tea gowns of the turn of the 20th century echo the lines of late aesthetic dress, and in their turn paved the way for the early Art Deco creations of Paul Poiret.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film was originally released in Japan as but was later retitled to to differentiate it from other elements of the franchise. Directed by Sōji Yoshikawa from a screenplay by Yoshikawa and cult pink film screenwriter Atsushi Yamatoya, the film was produced by animation studio Tokyo Movie Shinsha and distributed by Toho. The film's plot follows master thief Arsène Lupin III, who attempts to foil Mamo - a wealthy and powerful recluse seeking immortality - while trying to win the affections of his rival and would-be lover, Fujiko Mine.\n\nSince its original Japanese release, the film has been licensed to several companies for release in North America and Europe, with four different English dubs of the film being produced in that time. In 2013, North American distributor Discotek Media released the film on a DVD containing all four English dubs, as well as extensive liner notes and essays about the film and its production.\n\nFinancially successful upon release, \"The Mystery of Mamo\" has continued to polarize critics and fans of the \"Lupin\" franchise, especially in English-speaking markets. Praise for the film tends to be aimed at its originality and faithfulness to the manga, and criticism usually focuses on the execution of the third act. The English dubs, though varying widely in terms of their production quality, interpretation of the dialogue and voice acting, have frequently been singled out for praise.\n\nInspector Zenigata travels to Castle Dracula to confirm the execution of his longtime nemesis Arsène Lupin III; the body he finds is a decoy that is being used by the real Lupin to flee from the castle. Zenigata travels to Egypt, believing that Lupin will raid the Giza Necropolis based on prior thefts of immortality-granting objects. His prediction proves accurate, but Lupin and his colleagues Daisuke Jigen and Goemon Ishikawa XIII flee with the Philosopher's Stone. The Stone was requested by Lupin's would-be lover, Fujiko Mine, who, having agreed to obtain the Stone for a mysterious client, steals it from Lupin in Paris. The benefactor, who calls himself Mamo, discovers that the Stone is a fake made by Lupin.\n\nIn response, Lupin's gang is attacked by Mamo's forces before finding their hideout destroyed by his henchman, Flinch. Jigen and Goemon blame the hideout's destruction on Fujiko, before quarrelling between themselves; Lupin calms the others by promising to abandon his desires for Fujiko. With nowhere else to go, they travel toward the ocean before finding a house with food and water. A wounded Fujiko comes for Lupin, forcing him to go against his promise and causing Jigen and Goemon to abandon them. Fujiko drugs Lupin before Flinch arrives to take them to Mamo. Jigen later returns to find Flinch's plane taking off, but retrieves a clue to its destination. He and Goemon are later interrogated about Mamo by American agents, but are released when they are unable to answer their questions. During the inquiry, they decipher Fujiko's clue, leading them to Mamo's Caribbean island.\n\nMamo, a mysterious billionaire officially known as Howard Lockewood, tells Lupin that he manipulated him into stealing the Stone as a test, as he is considering granting him and Fujiko immortality in admiration of his skills and her beauty. Lupin, however, is more interested in the Stone, and searches Mamo's island for it. After retrieving the Stone, he and Fujiko are chased by Mamo's henchmen until they stumble across Mamo's lair. Mamo deems Lupin unworthy of eternal life and attempts to visualize his perverted nature to Fujiko, but she refuses to abandon him. The USAF attacks the base, having tracked Jigen and Goemon to the island. Jigen rescues Lupin and Fujiko and seemingly kills Mamo in a shootout, while Goemon duels with Flinch. The altercation damages Goemon's sword, the \"Zantetsuken\", causing him to leave for training purposes.\n\nLupin, Fujiko and Jigen travel to Colombia, where Lupin theorizes that Mamo may have gained eternal life by continuously cloning himself. They are thrust into a vision by Mamo, who reveals that his cloning technique has kept him alive for ten thousand years, and that he is responsible for virtually every major event in human history. Mamo also explains that he cloned Lupin. He then appears in person to reclaim Fujiko, and a distraught Lupin challenges him to perform a miracle. Mamo responds by setting off an earthquake through the destruction of a nuclear power station.\n\nInside a temple, Mamo explains to Fujiko that his cloning technique has never been perfected, and that he has degenerated from his original form as a result. He decides that he and Fujiko must repopulate the Earth, and convinces her to push a button to launch nuclear missiles to achieve this end. Lupin arrives, and reveals that he rigged the missiles to explode before they could launch. Frustrated, Mamo takes Fujiko with him to a launching pad and fends Lupin off with lasers. Lupin uses the tip of Goemon's sword (given to him by Jigen earlier) to deflect the lasers, incinerating Mamo.\n\nA rocketship emerges, containing a giant brain that reveals itself to be the original Mamo. Lupin realizes that Mamo had controlled his clones resembling his body just as the rocket launches into space. Lupin and Fujiko escape the rocket's trajectory, but not before Lupin plants an explosive on it. The glass shatters, and Mamo's brain drifts toward the sun. Lupin finds Fujiko in the rubble, where he is captured by Zenigata. Fujiko offers to help Lupin, but the Americans launch a missile attack on Mamo's base. Fujiko is rescued by Jigen, while Lupin and Zenigata, handcuffed together, escape on foot.\n\n\"The Mystery of Mamo\" was produced while the second \"Lupin III\" television series was being broadcast, and was created with the intention of making a film that was aesthetically and thematically faithful to Monkey Punch's original manga, as censorship standards of the time prevented such content being reproduced for TV animation. Due to an increased popularity of the first series, staff who had worked on that series were assembled to make the film. Yasuo Otsuka, who was animation director and character designer on that series, supervised the film's production. Sōji Yoshikawa, who storyboarded the first and last episodes of the first series, acted as director and co-writer of the screenplay. Atsushi Yamatoya, a writer and director of pink films who had written two episodes of the first series (and later the third animated \"Lupin\" film, \"Legend of the Gold of Babylon\"), also contributed to the script. Yuzo Aoki, a key animator for episodes 11 and 23 of the first series, was responsible for the angular, Monkey Punch-esque character designs seen in the film (he would later become noted for such work on \"Lupin III Part III\" and \"Legend of the Gold of Babylon\"). Tsutomu Shibayama, who was the character designer for the that had preceded the original series, was responsible for the layout. A relative newcomer in the film's production team was composer Yuji Ohno, who had provided the score for the second series. The main cast of the second series also resprised their roles for the film.\n\n\"Mamo\" was Tokyo Movie Shinsha's first full-length feature production. The movie was given a budget of 500 million yen, comparable to major live action films at the time and unheard of for an animated production. Production lasted for 15 months and involved 1,315 members of staff. The storyboard was 575 pages. 62,000 cel sheets were used in the animation, compared to 5,000 cels used in an average half-hour TV animation. Oversized cels were used and filmed in a modified VistaVision process known as \"Anime Vision\", which allowed for a brighter and sharper picture for projection in theaters compared to a TV production. 18,000 reference images were used for background and mechanical research, and 196 individual character drawings were created.\n\nMamo's name is taken from the villain Kyousuke Mamo who had appeared in the manga and first TV series. His physical design was inspired by Swan, Paul Williams' character in the 1974 musical horror film \"Phantom of the Paradise\", and represents a monster who is both a boy and an old man at the same time. Similarly, the characters of Special Presidential Aide Stuckey and Special Agent Gordon are parodies of Henry Kissinger and G. Gordon Liddy respectively.\n\n\"The Mystery of Mamo\" was originally released in Japan on December 16, 1978 as \"Lupin III\". The film was a financial success, earning 950 million yen and making it the ninth-highest grossing Japanese film of the 1979 film season. Footage from the film, along with scenes from \"The Castle of Cagliostro\", was used Stern Electronics (under license from TMS) to make the \"Dragon's Lair\"-style laserdisc video game \"Cliff Hanger\". By the mid-1980s, TMS re-titled the film in Japan as \"Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone\", while English-speaking fans had begun referring to the film as \"The Mystery of Mamo\", to distinguish it from the two TV series and \"The Castle of Cagliostro\".\n\nA TV broadcast of the film on March 28, 2014 on NTV attained an audience share of 11.2% in the Kantō region of Japan. It was the second highest share for a movie broadcast during that week.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the \"Lupin III\" franchise, \"The Mystery of Mamo\" received a limited theatrical re-release in Japan on September 1, 2017, utilizing a newly remastered print in 4K resolution, a 5.1 surround sound mix and 4D effects.\n\nThe original English-dubbed version of the film, commissioned by Toho, was produced by Frontier Enterprises; this dub, also titled \"Lupin III\" and dubbed in 1979, was made for JAL flights. It was also available from the Los Angeles branch of Toho for booking to play at local theaters - the University of California, Berkeley, was host to several showings. This version also has no credits for the voice cast itself on any known prints and as such, the full cast has yet to be verified. Lupin was voiced by Tom Clark, Goemon was voiced by William Ross (the owner of Frontier Enterprises, and the writer/director of its dubs) and Zenigata was voiced by Greg Starr (a Tokyo-based writer/editor). It was once speculated that actors from the English adaptation of \"Speed Racer\", including Peter Fernandez, Corinne Orr, Earl Hammond and Jack Grimes, were involved in this dub, but their involvement in its production has since been deemed impossible, given the manner in which the dub was produced. Despite being largely faithful to the original Japanese script, most of the names of the main characters were changed to Western-sounding alternatives. Anime historian Carl Horn provided Yasuo Otsuka with a VHS copy of the dub in 1987 because Otsuka was previously unaware of it.\n\nStreamline Pictures, through their distributor Orion Home Video, released the film for the first time on VHS in North America in April 1995. According to anime historian and former Streamline employee Fred Patten, Carl Macek could not release the film with the Toho dub at that time due to copyright issues with TMS, and had to redub the film. Much of the cast and crew that had worked on Streamline's dubs of \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" and \"Lupin III's Greatest Capers\" worked on the second dub of the film. Loosely based on the Toho dub and its script, this adaptation made various alterations to the film's original dialogue. Streamline's release used \"The Mystery of Mamo\" title, in spite of the character's name being meant to be spelled \"Mamaux\" in English. The decision to keep the \"Mamo\" spelling was based on fan familiarity and a desire to avoid upsetting the fans by changing it. A Region 0 DVD of the film with the Streamline dub was released by Image Entertainment on April 21, 1998.\nOn July 8, 1996, the film was released on VHS in Britain by Manga Video as \"Secret of Mamo\". This release used a third dub adapted and directed by actor-director George Roubicek, with the script also being based on that of the Toho dub. In order to avoid possible legal disputes with the estate of Maurice Leblanc (the creator of the original Arsène Lupin), Lupin's name was changed to \"Wolf III\" for this dub. Manga later released a DVD of the film with the same title on August 4, 2008.\n\nOn July 29, 2003, Geneon (then known as Pioneer Entertainment) re-released the film on DVD in North America using an anamorphic print taken from the Japanese DVD; the print was modified to remove unlicensed usages of corporate logos, as well as a magazine image depicting Lupin with the Justice League. Another English dub was produced for this release by Phuuz Entertainment, using the cast that was dubbing the second TV series. A DVD utilizing Pioneer's dub and transfer was released by Madman Entertainment in Australia on August 16, 2006. As with their dub of the series, Pioneer's dub of the film has attracted a moderate amount of criticism - while the voice acting in the dub has been well-received, the script, which took a liberal approach with translating the Japanese dialogue, received a mixed reaction from critics and fans. In 2012, TMS Entertainment began showing this dub on the Hulu video streaming service.\n\nDiscotek Media released a new edition of \"The Mystery of Mamo\" on DVD in America on February 26, 2013. The release utilizes an uncut Japanese print, and includes all four English dubs, in addition to the original Japanese audio, as well as several essays and liner notes on the film. The Toho/Frontier dub was extensively restored and reconstructed from an edited version of the dub released on a previous Italian DVD release of the film, as well as copies of the dub provided by fans.\n\n\"Manga Mania\" reviewer Peter Lyle described the film as \"a convoluted tale that plays like the adventures of James Bond, Don Juan and Charlie Chaplin all rolled into one\" with \"plenty of wry humour and slapstick\". Lyle additionally praised the animated effects and supporting characters. In summary he felt that \"Mamo\" was \"a healthy dose of fun\".\n\nIn his review for \"Mania.com\", Chris Beverdige enjoyed the movie despite having previously disliked it on a previous viewing several years before. He attributes this to being more familiar with the characters through other entries in the \"Lupin III\" franchise. However, he criticised the final third of the movie for its science fiction elements, which he felt were inferior to the action and character-driven elements of the first two thirds. This criticism was shared in another review for \"Mania.com\" by John Erini, except that he believed that the film became unwatchable due to the development of the Mamo character.\n\nRob Lineberger, writing for \"DVD Verdict\", also agrees with the criticism of the final third, and despite repeated viewings, felt no closer to understanding the events. Additionally, he criticised the \"lack of cohesion\" and \"unbroken string of jump cuts and deux ex machinas\" throughout the film. Reflecting on the positives of the film, Lineberger highlights the characters of Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko as being more interesting than either Lupin or Mamo. He also credits the movie for tackling interesting concepts such as cloning, personal identity, love and honour, despite the way they are presented. In summary, he suggests that \"Lupin\" fans will find a more ambitious story in this film than the television episodes if they can accept some flaws. He recommends people who are not \"Lupin\" fans to watch \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" instead.\n\nDarius Washington of \"The Fandom Post\" reviewed the Discotek edition of \"Mamo\". He described the structure of the film's story as \"haphazard\" and \"a bit hard to get into\", while praising the collection of \"educational\" extras and different English dubs on Discotek's release. In conclusion, Washington felt that \"the film itself is decent\", but is more suited for learning about anime history than for entertainment value. He gave the film content a \"B\" rating and the extras an \"A+\" rating.\n\n\"Lupin\" expert Reed Nelson, in writing a feature titled \"Lupin the Third: The Complete Guide to Films, TV Specials and OVAs\" for Anime News Network (ANN), placed \"Mamo\" in the \"Maybe\" category of the franchise's media that he considered was worth viewing. Praising Discotek Media's \"fancy\" DVD release, he described the film as \"often held up as \"the\" example of how to write a \"Lupin\" story - it has unfolding drama within the core cast, a truly threatening villain, and an unusual dedication to mature storytelling. Note that its gangly character designs and false endings may be kind of a turn-off for modern audiences\".\n\nIn an essay included with Discotek Media's release, ANN contributor Mike Toole highly praised \"The Mystery of Mamo\" in virtually every aspect, describing the film as \"the absolute essence of \"Lupin III\"\". Toole particularly lauded Sōji Yoshikawa's direction (likening the director's affinity for bizarre images and situations to the works of Werner Herzog), as well as the film's cartoonish but detailed animation and design work, characterization and humour. He also gave praise to all four English language tracks of the film, particularly the Toho dub, and noted the film's relevance to real-world events of the time (including the Cold War, the Watergate Scandal, the publication of David Rorvik's novel \"In his Image: The Cloning of a Man\" and the birth of Louise Brown). Toole concludes his essay by stating that \"[m]ore than 30 years after its debut, [\"The Mystery of Mamo\"], with its heady mix of globe-trotting action, raciness, wild comedy, and hot jazz-funk music, is the original \"Lupin\", the real deal. Accept no substitutes - even if they're clones! As the international trailer for this anime classic proclaims: Lupin III can do anything!\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2160219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160219", "title": "Native resolution", "text": "Native resolution\n\nThe native resolution of a LCD, LCoS or other flat panel display refers to its single fixed resolution. As an LCD consists of a fixed raster, it cannot change resolution to match the signal being displayed as a CRT monitor can, meaning that optimal display quality can be reached only when the signal input matches the native resolution. An image where the number of pixels is the same as in the image source and where the pixels are perfectly aligned to the pixels in the source is said to be \"pixel perfect\".\n\nWhile CRT monitors can usually display images at various resolutions, an LCD monitor has to rely on interpolation (scaling of the image), which causes a loss of image quality. An LCD has to scale up a smaller image to fit into the area of the native resolution. This is the same principle as taking a smaller image in an image editing program and enlarging it; the smaller image loses its sharpness when it is expanded. This is especially problematic as most resolutions are in a 4:3 aspect ratio (640×480, 800×600, 1024×768, 1280×960, 1600×1200) but there are odd resolutions that are not, notably 1280×1024. If a user were to map 1024×768 to a 1280×1024 screen there would be distortion as well as some image errors, as there is not a one-to-one mapping with regard to pixels. This results in noticeable quality loss and the image is much less sharp.\n\nIn theory, some resolutions could work well, if they are exact multiples of smaller image sizes. For example, a 1600×1200 LCD could display an 800×600 image well, as each of the pixels in the image could be represented by a block of four on the larger display, without interpolation. Since 800×600 is an integer factor of 1600×1200, scaling should not adversely affect the image. But in practice, most monitors apply a smoothing algorithm to all smaller resolutions, so the quality still suffers for these \"half\" modes.\n\nMost LCD monitors are able to inform the PC of their native resolution using Extended display identification data (EDID); however, some LCD TVs, especially those with 1366x768 pixels, fail to provide their native resolution and only provide a set of lower resolutions, resulting in a less than pixel perfect output.\n\nSome widescreen LCD monitors optionally display lower resolutions without scaling or stretching an image, so that the image will always be in full sharpness, although it will not occupy the full screen. This is most often recognizable upon close inspection, as there will typically be black edges visible on either side of the panel horizon.\n\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n"}

These two counties form the southernmost portion of the 13 county Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, although County 42 runs across the northern reaches of the two counties.\n\nCounty Road 42 serves as an east–west arterial route for the South of the River suburbs of the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area. The roadway connects the communities of Shakopee, Prior Lake, Savage, Burnsville, Apple Valley, Rosemount, and Hastings; which are all located south of the Minnesota River.\n\nFrom west to east, the route follows 140th Street, Egan Drive, 150th Street and 145th Street. Its westernmost terminus is at Shakopee in Scott County, where it intersects County Road 17 (Marschall Road). The eastern terminus of County 42 is at Hastings in Dakota County, where it meets U.S. Highway 61.\n\nCounty 42 is designated as a principal arterial highway by the Metropolitan Council, and the roadway is supposed to have limited commercial access and traffic signals only at one-half mile intervals. However, because it was used as a primary commercial road before its designation as a principal arterial highway, it passes directly through the downtown areas of several cities in Scott and Dakota Counties; most notably Burnsville and Apple Valley in Dakota County\n\nMost of County Road 42 is designated as part of the National Highway System. The major highways it intersects from west to east are: State Highway 13, Interstate 35W, Interstate 35E, Cedar Avenue two miles (3 km) south of the terminus of State Highway 77, State Highway 3, U.S. 52, State Highway 55, and U.S. 61.\n\nCounty Road 42 was authorized and paved during the 1960s.\n\nIn July 2007, construction began to widen County Road 42 to six lanes from Glendale Road in Savage to County Road 5 in Burnsville. Also, the old traffic signals between Glendale Road and County Road 5, were replaced with new ones. The project was completed by summer 2008.\n\nA proposed reconstruction project at the interchange with U.S. Highway 52 in Rosemount, will reconstruct the interchange to a cloverleaf interchange.

{"id": "2160224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160224", "title": "Hsiung Feng IIE", "text": "Hsiung Feng IIE\n\nThe Hsiung Feng IIE (HF-2E; ) is a surface-to-surface cruise missile system developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) in Taiwan.\n\nAccording to \"Taiwan Defense Review\" (TDR), the HF-2E land attack cruise missile is not a derivative of the Hsiung Feng 2 HF-2 anti-ship missile as it is often incorrectly reported. The use of the \"HF-2E\" designation is the primary cause of this confusion and was intentional misinformation done to divert attention away from the true nature of the project, which is that of a long range offensive cruise missile. The HF-2E is actually a completely different design and is said to serve a similar function in Taiwan's military as the US Navy Tomahawk (RGM-109) cruise missile. Its launch weight is reported to be in the range, including its solid rocket booster. It is essentially a tactical land attack cruise missile designed for use against military target sets, particularly air-defense fire units and command-and-control facilities, and its relatively small warhead size and the rather limited number of missiles planned for procurement clearly suggest that this is not a \"first strike\" weapon.\n\nThe project was first announced in 2001. Following several test firings in 2004 and early 2005 at the Jiu Peng Missile Range in southeastern Taiwan, the baseline HF-2E (Block I) completed its operational evaluation (OPEVAL) in 2005, the missile flying a low-altitude circuit off Taiwan's southeastern coastline between Pingtung and Lanyu Island. An improved HF-2E missile was reportedly tested by CSIST at Jui Peng Missile Range on 2 February 2007. In 2017 the missiles received an extensive upgrade to increase their effectiveness against naval targets.\n\nThe baseline HF-2E Block I land attack cruise missile (LACM) is said to be powered by an indigenously-developed Taiwanese turbofan engine believed to be rated in the thrust range and developed by CSIST partially based on technology and experience from the Microturbo 078 turbojet engine used on Hsiung Feng 2 (HF-2) anti-ship cruise missiles. When equipped with a standard unitary high-explosive -class warhead, it is said to have a maximum range of 700 km. Other types of warhead are said to be in development, such as cluster submunitions and a hard target penetrator warhead. TDR also reported that through modification of the existing engine and combined with the redesign and reduction of the missile's control and electronic systems, CSIST was able to free up enough internal space/weight in the missile to allow it to carry additional fuel and extend its range to over 2,000 km, although a \"Defense News\" report claimed the other version was only an 800 km range missile. The ultimate objective is to develop a missile that has an objective range of over , using a technologically advanced Taiwanese power plant with superior fuel efficiency and mission endurance, and possibly a more advanced and lighter miniaturized warhead.\n\nThe HF-2E Block I missile uses inertial guidance with Global Positioning System (GPS) and TERCOM updates. For terminal guidance, it uses infrared homing (Imaging infrared) with an autonomous digital target recognition system. The IIR terminal seeker is used for target acquisition and to positively identify an optimal aim point. The target image is then compared against digitized files in the memory of the on-board guidance computer (DSMAC terminal guidance). The HF-2E block I missile's cruising speed is high subsonic, typically in the range. When the missile approaches hostile territory, it would descend to an altitude of about . On its final approach to its target, the missile would climb up to avoid any physical barriers and to allow its IIR seeker to acquire the target and identify an optimal aim point before plunging down onto the designated impact point. The report in Taiwan Defense Review, credited the HF-2E block I missile with a pre-terminal accuracy of around 15 m.\n\nThe low-rate production of the Block I missile was to have started in July 2005 and using funds originally allocated for its R&D, at least five missiles were built. The unit cost per missile was estimated to be at US$3.08 million (2003 US$ dollar value). Another report made in 2006 claimed that three batteries comprising twenty-four mobile launchers and forty-eight missiles were in the final stages of testing and may be fielded within two years. The HF-2E is currently in low volume production in the Project ChiChun (戟隼, jǐ zhǔn, \"lance hawk\"). A \"Taipei Times\" news report claimed that President Ma Ying Jeou ordered the production of over 500 to 1000 HF-2E missiles in 2008. Now approved and cleared to enter full volume/serial production in 2011. It supposedly can deliver a unitary warhead . The Associated Press has reported a range of 1,500 km.\n\nThe HF-2E missile is primarily deployed operationally in ground-mobile launchers. The launcher vehicle carries the missiles in protective aluminum box launchers, with wings and control fins retracted, conceptually similar to the trailer-mounted mobile launchers for Tien Kung Sky Bow series surface-to-air missiles and HF-2 coastal defense missiles. The launchers are normally be based in hardened shelters at military installations, with deployment to remote, pre-surveyed launch sites during alert situations. The SCMP has reported that the HF-IIE is closely watched by the PLA's Rocket Force.\n\n\n\n"}

The Jackson 5's versions of \"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\" and \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" remain frequent radio requests during the Christmas season. The album spent all four weeks at the number one position on \"Billboard\" magazine's special Christmas Albums chart that the magazine published in December 1970, making it the best-selling Christmas album of that year and also year 1972. This album was a top seller and would have charted high on the \"Billboard\" 200, but from 1963 to 1973, holiday albums were not allowed to chart. It has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide. The album has also been praised by critics. \n\nIn the US, the album was released on CD in 1986.

Wells, written in four months in 1907 and serialised and published in 1908 in \"The Pall Mall Magazine\", is like many of Wells's works notable for its prophetic ideas, images, and concepts—in this case, the use of the aircraft for the purpose of warfare and the coming of World War I. The novel's hero is Bert Smallways, a \"forward-thinking young man\" and a \"kind of bicycle engineer of the let's-'ave-a-look-at-it and enamel-chipping variety.\"\n\nThe first three chapters of \"The War in the Air\" relate details of the life of Bert Smallways and his extended family in a location called Bun Hill, a (fictional) former Kentish village that had become a London suburb within living memory. The story begins with Bert's brother Tom, a stolid greengrocer who views technological progress with apprehension, and their aged father, who recalls with longing the time when Bun Hill was a quiet village and he had driven the local squire's carriage. However, the story soon focuses on Bert who is an unimpressive, not particularly gifted, unsuccessful young man with few ideas about larger things but is far from unintelligent. He has a strong attachment to a young woman named Edna. \n\nWhen bankruptcy threatens one summer, he and his partner abandon the shop, devise a singing act (\"the Desert Dervishes\"), and resolve to try their fortunes in English sea resorts. As chance would have, their initial performance is interrupted by a balloon which lands on the beach before them, and which turns out to contain one Mr. Butteridge. Butteridge is famous for his successful invention of an easily manoeuvrable fixed-wing aircraft whose secret he has not revealed and that he is seeking to sell to the British government or, failing that, to Germany. Prior to Butteridge, nobody had succeeded in producing a practical heavier-than-air machine, only a few awkward devices of limited utility such as the German \"Drachenflieger\", which had to be towed aloft and released from an airship. Butteridge's invention is a major breakthrough, as it is highly manoeuvrable, capable of both very fast and very slow flight, and requires only a small area to take off and land, reminiscent of the later autogyro.\n\nBy accident Bert is carried off in Butteridge's balloon, and discovers Butteridge's secret plans on board it. Bert is clever enough to appraise his situation, and when the balloon is shot down in a secret German \"aeronautic park east of Hamburg,\" Bert tries to sell Mr. Butteridges's invention. However, he has stumbled upon the German air fleet just as it is about to launch a surprise attack on the United States – and Prince Karl Albert, the author and leader of this plan, decides to take him along for the campaign. The Prince, world-famous as \"The German Alexander\" or Napoleon, is a living manifestation of German Nationalism and boundless imperial ambitions, his personality as depicted by Wells in some ways resembling that of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Bert's disguise is soon seen through by the Germans, and – narrowly avoiding being summarily thrown overboard by the furious Prince – he is relegated to the role of a witness to the true horror of war.\n\nThe German aerial forces, comprising airships and Drachenfliegers, are mounting their surprise attack on the United States before the Americans can build a large aerial navy; the pretext for the attack is a German demand for the US to abandon the Monroe Doctrine, so as to facilitate German imperial ambitions in South America. The Germans are, however, unaware that the \"Confederation of Eastern Asia\" (China and Japan) has secretly been building a massive air force. Tensions between Japan and the United States, exacerbated by the issue of American citizenship being denied to Japanese immigrants, leads to war breaking out between the Confederation of Eastern Asia and the US, whereupon the Confederation turns out to possess overwhelmingly strong aerial forces, and the US finds itself fighting a war on two fronts: the Eastern and the Western, in the air as well on sea.\n\nBert Smallways is present as the Germans first attack an American naval fleet in the Atlantic, utterly obliterating it and proving Dreadnoughts to be obsolete and helpless against aerial bombardment. The Germans then appear over New York City, bomb several key points, and establish that they have the city at their mercy, whereupon the Mayor, with the consent of the White House, offers New York's surrender. However, the surrender announcement rouses the population's patriotic fury; local militias rebel and manage to destroy a German airship over Union Square using a concealed artillery piece. Following this, the vengeful Prince orders a wholesale destruction, airships moving along Broadway and systematically raining death and destruction on the population below.\n\nFollowing the destruction of New York, the far inferior American flying machines launch a suicidal attack on the overwhelming German force. They are almost completely obliterated, but cripple the Germans. The Prince's flagship is disabled, and is unable to avoid being driven north by gale-force winds, eventually crashlanding in Labrador. Bert becomes an official member of the crew, as they struggle to survive in the freezing wilderness, befriends an English-speaking German junior officer, and for a time feels strong fellowship towards his crew mates. After a week they are picked up by another German airship, and carried directly into the fray of a ferocious new battle.\n\nAccording to the Prince's plans for the attack on the US, simultaneously with the subduing of New York, other German forces had landed at Niagara Falls, summarily evicted all the American population as far as Buffalo, and set to work building a large German airfield on American soil. However, the Asians – who have their own plans of conquest in America, and have already destroyed San Francisco – send their aerial forces over the Rocky Mountains and engage the Germans in battle, seeking to conquer or destroy the Niagara base.\n\nThe Asiatic air fleet is equipped with large numbers of lightweight one-man flying machines called \"Niais\", which appear to be ornithopters, armed with a gun carried by the pilot firing explosive bullets \"loaded with oxygen\" (i.e. incendiary bullets) for use against the hydrogen-filled airships. The Asians prove overwhelmingly superior, and the German airships are either destroyed or forced to flee, eventually surrendering to the Americans; only a few remain with Prince Karl Albert, who attempts a heroic last stand.\n\nBert is stranded on Goat Island in the middle of Niagara Falls, where he finds a crashed \"Niais\" and discovers that Prince Karl Albert and a surviving German officer share the island with him. Their clash of personalities eventually culminates in a life-or-death confrontation, and Bert – originally gentle and sickened by bloodshed – overcomes his civilised scruples and kills the Prince. Bert then manages to repair the Asian flying machine and escapes from the island on it, crash-landing near Tanooda, New York.\n\nUpon making contact with local Americans, Bert learns that the Asiatic forces have landed \"a million men\" on the western seaboard. The original German-American conflict, which had set off the conflagration, is almost forgotten in the massive conflict with the Asian forces – a conflict carried out with great savagery, neither side taking prisoners. All over the US, Chinese Americans are being lynched and in some places the lynching extends to Blacks as well.\n\nBert learns that the war is going badly for the Americans, who are unable to withstand the superior Asian flying machines; the Americans mourn the loss of the Butteridge machine which might have turned the tide, if its inventor had not died suddenly shortly before the outbreak of war, taking his secret with him. Bert discloses that the plans for Butteridge's flying machine are in his possession, whereupon a local militia leader named Laurier urges him to turn the plans over to the President.\n\nAfter an adventurous ride through war-ravaged upstate New York they find the President hiding out in \"Pinkerville on the Hudson.\" The President proceeds to have copies printed and distributed widely all over the US, as well as sent to Europe. However, the results are not quite as expected. A decisive Asiatic victory is, indeed, averted – but there is no American or European victory, either. The Butteridge machine is cheap, easy and quick to build, and needs no big fields to take off or land – which mean it can be built and operated not only by national governments, but also by private groups, local militias, and even bandits – a development which tends to break up the war into a vast, incoherent multitude of localised struggles and which accelerates the already-begun process of break-up and disintegration of the world's nations.\n\nWhile Bert experiences directly the events in America, news about what has happened in the rest of the world (specifically, in his native England) is few and scattered, with newspapers reduced to a single page before finally ceasing publication altogether; still, he hears with great alarm that London had shared the fate of New York.\n\nThe omniscient author, whose point of view is that of a future historian documenting the war and its aftermath, reveals information not available to Bert. The German assault on the US had bypassed Germany's European rivals, whose air fleets were considered too puny to constitute a threat, with the intention of totally dominating them once the Americans had been subdued. However, the alarmed United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy pooled their aerial resources into a single strong force, passed through Swiss airspace after destroying that country's own flying machines, and devastated Hamburg and Berlin. The Germans mobilised a counter-attack which destroyed London and Paris, but then, as in America, the feuding Europeans were faced with an enormous attack from Asia.\n\nThe Asiatic fleet had attacked a combined Anglo-Indian aerial force, captured the Burmese airfields, Australia, and the Pacific islands. They then struck westwards, capturing the Middle East and South Africa and starting to build airships at Cairo, Damascus and Johannesburg. Moving further northwards, they soon reached Armenia and then defeating the German forces in the Battle of the Carpathians before attacking Western Europe.\n\nA global financial collapse is caused by hostile nations freezing assets, and the end of the credit system. This is referred to as \"the Panic,\" which is followed by \"The Purple Death.\" The War in the Air, the Panic, and the Purple Death bring about \"[w]ithin the space of five years\" a total collapse of \"the whole fabric of civilisation.\" But Bert Smallways, fixated on his amorous attachment, returns home after many adventures to kill a rival and win the hand of his beloved Edna; they marry and have eleven children. We are assured in the final chapter that \"our present world state, orderly, scientific, and secured,\" is eventually established, but the novel reverts to the ensuing fortunes of the Smallways family as England relapses into a sort of an agricultural barbaric age.\n\nThe story was written in 1907 and depicts a war happening in the late 1910s – then a future history, which can be considered as a retroactive alternate history. The basic assumption behind the plot is that immediately after the Wright Brothers's first successful flight in 1903, all of the world's major powers became aware of the decisive strategic importance of air power, and embarked on a secret arms race to develop this power (there is a reference to the Wright Brothers themselves disappearing from public view, having been recruited for a secret military project of the US Government – as were other aviation pioneers in their own respective countries). The general public is virtually unaware of this arms race, until it finally bursts out in a vastly destructive war which destroys civilisation.\n\nIn actual history, it took politicians and generals several decades to fully grasp these strategic implications. Moreover, the limited effect of the World War I German airship raids on London proved airships far from being the overwhelming destructive weapon depicted in Wells' book, nor were the early aeroplanes of the 1900s and 1910s capable of such massive bombings and destruction. Thus, the visions conjured by Wells were prophetic of the Second World War rather than the First one. (In fact, the actual First World war – characterised by very rigid fronts and a clear advantage of defence over offence – turned out to be the diametrical opposite of the one depicted by Wells, a completely fluid war with no clear fronts, and with a devastating offence against which no effective defence is possible.)\n\nThe latter parts of the book feature a post-apocalyptic theme – i.e., worldwide use of weapons of mass destruction and the war ending with no victors but with the total collapse of civilisation and the disintegration of all warring powers – which prefigures the themes of the later extensive literature depicting the aftermath of a Third World War. A similar theme appears in Wells' later \"The Shape of Things to Come\". In a sense, \"Things to Come\" is a kind of sequel to \"The War in the Air\". Though the details of the war in the latter book are different, its outcome is essentially the same – a complete disintegration of civilisation. \"Things to Come\" concentrates on the reconstruction of the world after this vast destruction and the creation of a peaceful, prosperous world state – and it depicts pilots and their aircraft as having a key role in re-building and unifying the world, just as they had a key role in destroying it. Also the major semi-historical chapters – interspersed in \"The War in the Air\" between the depictions of Bert Smallways' personal adventures, and written from the perspective of a future historian looking back with compassion at Twentieth Century people and their lethal nationalistic folly – clearly prefigure the tone of \"Things to Come\".\n\nThe idea of Japan and China uniting into a single power, the \"Confederation of East Asia\", prefigures \"Eastasia\" which is one of the three world powers in George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty Four\". The military might and ability attributed to the Sino-Japanese alliance is clearly and manifestly inflated: constructing far more airships and flying machines than all the rest of the world put together; waging simultaneous all-out wars of conquest against the United States, Britain, Germany, and other powers; performing the gigantic logistical task of transporting a million people across the Pacific within a few days while at the same time conducting extensive military operations all over Asia, Africa, Europe and North America.\n\nAs was pointed out by George Bright, there was no way that a sober analysis of Japan and China's economic and military potential would have led Wells to attribute to them such might – even assuming, as the book does, an incredibly fast industrialisation of China, a backward and predominantly agrarian country at the time of writing. Rather, this theme is clearly linked to fears of the \"Yellow Peril\", prevalent in Edwardian Britain as in other Western countries.\n\nSpecifically, Wells' book is considered to have been influenced by M. P. Shiel's best-selling \"The Yellow Danger\", which also influenced Jack London's \"The Unparalleled Invasion\" (1910). A bit of scepticism on this issue is retained in \"The War in the Air\" in a passage where a German officer, hearing of the massive Asiatic offensive, remarks with astonishment: \"The Yellow Peril was a peril, after all!\".\n\nThe recent Japanese success in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the first time when a \"Yellow\" army proved superior to a European one, was fresh in the memory of Wells' readers, the worldwide Asian assault depicted being in effect a monstrously magnified echo of the Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur.\n\nWhile the above could be considered as pandering to prevalent racist prejudices and fears, \"The War in the Air\" is at the same time strongly scathing towards British Imperialism and Colonialism and their literary mouthpiece Kipling. Wells is outspokenly critical of the British educational system and popular press for inculcating in young men such as Bert a contempt towards \"The Subject Races\" and a belief that the British Empire could forever perpetuate its rule over them.\n\nOn this issue the book can be considered as prophetic of the 1930s and 1940s – correctly predicting that new elites in the colonies would form national movements and seek to shake off British rule, that India and Egypt would see the rise of particularly strong such movements, that the Indian National Movement would then split into mutually-hostile Hindu and Muslim factions (with the Muslim one focused on the North West Provinces, the future Pakistan) – and that an overwhelming military attack from the Far East would spell the end of British rule in Asia, while failing to establish a lasting domination by the invaders themselves.\n\nThe background of Bert Smallways bears some resemblance to Wells' own – a working-class family in a London suburb (which is similar to Wells' native Bromley), with a struggling small shop. Jessica, Bert's strong-willed but narrow-minded sister in law – a former domestic servant who rose to a kind of petit bourgeois respectability and who tries to make Bert an errand boy in the family shop – resembles Wells' mother who intended him to be a draper. Bert seeks to break out of this background, as Wells did, but fails to gain the higher education which Wells got, and in the conditions of worldwide collapse he ends up as a semi-Medieval peasant eking out a bare subsistence.\n\nBert's basic moral attitudes go through three distinct stages. To begin with, he tends to glorify war and support the British Empire and the wars waged to maintain this empire – this in a shallow way, derived from the popular press and without having or expecting to have a personal experience of war and bloodshed. When on board the German air fleet, Bert is exposed to a mounting series of horrors and bloody scenes which make him increasingly sickened. The same process is shared with Lieutenant Kurt, the young English-speaking German whom Bert befriends; a professional military officer, Kurt had in fact not witnessed war before, either, and he is equally sickened and vehemently rejects the idea that people should be \"blooded\" to make them used to violence and bloodshed. When marooned on Goat Island and finding himself locked in a deadly confrontation with the two equally marooned Germans, Bert is full of compunctions and does not want to kill them. After having killed the Prince, Bert speaks to the kitten he had rescued in the middle of all the carnage, telling the innocent little creature of his regrets at having committed this act. Moreover, Bert does spare the other German officer roaming the island, even when having him in his gun sights. Nevertheless, Bert did become \"blooded\" through the killing of the Prince, and undergoes further unspecified \"violent incidents\" during his harrowing crossing of the Atlantic and then while crossing on foot a starving English countryside which is fast reverting to barbarism. A year later, when finding back his beloved Edna and discovering her to be intimidated by a local strongman seeking to add her to his \"harem\", Bert feels no hesitation or compunction about shooting the man out of hand and taking over his gang. When last seen, Bert – now a leading man in a peasant community formed by survivors – takes his six-year-old son to see the hanging of pig-thieves, since \"the boy should be blooded\".\n\nOne biographer has called \"The War in the Air\" \"an extraordinary concoction—as if H.G. had shaken up \"Kipps\" and \"The War of the Worlds\" and poured out a new story that would appeal both to those who liked his social comedies and those who had been impressed by his early fantasies of terror.\" Beatrice Webb annoyed Wells by preferring \"The War in the Air\" to \"Tono-Bungay\", which Wells regarded as his masterpiece.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160255", "title": "Heuriger", "text": "Heuriger\n\nHeuriger (; Austrian dialect pronunciation: Heiriga) is the name given to taverns in Eastern Austria at which local winemakers serve their new wine under a special licence in alternate months during the growing season. The \"Heurige\" are renowned for their atmosphere of \"Gemütlichkeit\" shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and - in some places - Schrammelmusik. They correspond to the Straußwirtschaften in the German Rheinland, the \"Frasche\" in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and \"Osmiza\" in Slovenia.\n\n\"Heuriger\" is the abbreviation of \"heuriger Wein\" (this year's wine) in Austrian and Bavarian German. Originally, they were simple open-air taverns on the premises of winemakers, where people would bring along food and drink the new wine. Nowadays, the taverns are often situated at a distance from the wineyards and offer both food and drinks. \"Heurige\" where apple or pear cider is served are called \"Mostheurige\". In the well-known wine-growing areas of the city of Vienna (Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift, Liesing) many eating establishments have a rustic interior design similar to \"Heurige\", yet they have a normal licence and sell wine they buy from outside sources.\n\nOn 17 August 1784 Austrian Emperor Joseph II issued a decree that permitted all residents to open establishments to sell and serve self-produced \"wine and juices.\" At first no food could be sold in order to prevent competition with restaurants, but over time these restrictions lessened. \n\nOver the years well-known areas for \"Heurigen\" developed, including Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift am Walde, Perchtoldsdorf, Mauer, Stammersdorf, Guntramsdorf, Gumpoldskirchen, Traiskirchen, Gainfarn, Dürnstein, Langenlois, the Wachau region, Rust, Königstetten, Gamlitz, and Kitzeck.\n\nSimilar establishments exist in wine-producing regions elsewhere in Austria, known as \"Buschenschank\" in Styria, and \"Straußen\", \"Besenwirtschaft\", or \"Heckenwirtschaft\" in Germany and other German-speaking areas.\n\nA \"Heuriger\" is prized both for the charms of what it offers and its limitations. Each \"Heuriger\" is only open briefly, usually 2 or 3 weeks during a four month season in the Fall, although it may reopen again later in the season when more wine has been produced. It serves only its own wine, and but a limited selection of food as an evening meal, generally local, homemade products offered as small dishes such as Liptauer spread, various meat or sausage and Semmel combinations, or cheese boards.\n\nTypical drinks found at \"Heurigen\" include Sturm, a partially fermented wine sold at the beginning of fall that still contains a fair amount of grape, and Gruner Veltliner, which is one of the most popular types of Austrian wine. Almdudler and Gespritzer are also commonly found at modern \"Heurigen.\" Lucky patrons will sometimes find Eiswein to enjoy with dessert. \n\n\"Heurigen\" indicate that they are open and guests welcome by displaying a handful of conifer or fir twigs bound in a circular \"Buschen\" hung above the entrance door. Until the 20th century, it was customary for guests to bring along their own food when enjoying wine at a \"Heuriger\". To make an establishment more profitable, in many places the tavern was leased to other winemakers (\"Winzer\" in German), known as \"Winzerstuben\".\n\n\"Gemütlichkeit\" shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and traditional music is one of the greatest appeals of a \"Heuriger\". As a result, many establishments elsewhere, such as in Vienna, are made to look like \"Heurigen\" but in fact are licensed restaurants selling wines from outside sources; these even serve beer and coffee, unthinkable at an authentic \"Heuriger\".\n\nMusic has traditionally been part of the \"Heuriger\" ambiance and contributes greatly to its \"Gemütlichkeit\". When present today it is typically provided by a pair of \"Heurigensänger\" who serenade from table to table for tips. Playing a guitar and accordion, they take requests for songs from their repertoire of \"Wienerlieder\" and Schrammelmusik.\n\nThese songs' themes invariably revolve around the quality of the wine, its consumption and consequences, Vienna's beauty, a nostalgic longing for the past, the transience of life, the inevitability of suffering and death at God's will, and, to a somewhat lesser degree, romantic love.\n\nEven trying to honor the \"Heuriger\" tradition, music has changed dramatically since performers such as The Third Man sensation Anton Karas earned a living by playing his zither or Hans Moser sang a \"Wienerlied\" from his movies. Visitors from Germany will hope to hear songs from their native land, as will those from others; the \"Heurigensänger\" will try their best.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160265", "title": "Campbell University", "text": "Campbell University\n\nCampbell University is a private university in Buies Creek, North Carolina. Founded in 1887 by a young Baptist minister, J.A. Campbell, the school today enrolls more North Carolinians than any other private university in the state of North Carolina .\n\nCampbell's main campus in Buies Creek is home to its College of Arts & Sciences, College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, Divinity School, School of Education, Lundy-Fetterman School of Business and School of Engineering. The nearby Health Sciences Campus is home to the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing. The Raleigh Campus in downtown Raleigh is home to the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, as well as other programs. Campbell also provides online classes through Adult & Online Education, has campuses in Fort Bragg/Pope Air Force Base and at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and maintains a degree program at Tunku Abdul Rahman College in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nCampbell University is home to the Fighting Camels; its athletics programs field 20 NCAA Division I teams.\n\nOn January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell, a 26-year-old Baptist minister, welcomed 16 students to a small church in Buies Creek, North Carolina, for the first day of classes for the school he founded: Buies Creek Academy. By the end of the first term, there were 92 students.\n\nIn the beginning days, Buies Creek Academy had just three faculty members: J.A. Campbell was principal; A. E. Booth, a graduate of the Nashville Normal College, served as assistant and teacher of the Normal Department and Business College; and Cornelia F. Pearson was an assistant and teacher in the Primary Department.\n\nThe 1887 catalog lauded the rural location: \"Being in the country, we avoid many of the temptations incident to towns and cities and save our patrons much extravagance in dress.\" The first commencement took place on May 20, 1887, and every student participated in the program. Josephus Daniels of Raleigh, an editor of the State Chronicle and later owner of The Raleigh News & Observer, delivered the main address.\n\nUpon his return to Raleigh, he described his impressions of the Academy: \"\"Among my pleasant memories of a trip to Harnett, none are more cherished by me with more fondness than the enjoyment of the excellent commencement exercise at Buies Creek Academy. It was a rare feast. The scholars are not prodigies; they do not surpass other boys and girls in the state, but they recite with ease, enunciate with distinctiveness, and gave choice sections of music and evidence the good training they had received. There was an absence of straining after effect, which was refreshing. There was simplicity and a regard for the fitness of things that are charming. There was an order and arrangement that showed a thoughtful and sensible management. I congratulate the people of Harnett on the excellent advantages Buies Creek Academy offers for the education of the children of the rising generation.\"\"\n\nThe beginning of the 20th Century ushered in tremendous hardship for the young school. On the evening of December 20, 1900, a suspicious fire destroyed the Academy and all the buildings except for the large wooden tabernacle. Awakened at 3:30 a.m. to witness the destruction, J.A. Campbell recalled: \"\"When I ran up to the fire, the terrible fire, that was burning down chances for poor boys and girls, and I knew that I could not build again ... the flames that destroyed the labor of years [...] the only hope for hundreds of boys and girls was being swept away, I could not bear up longer [...] When they asked me my plans, I said, \"Well, there's no chance to go on.\"\"\n\nAfter the fire, Zachary Taylor Kivett came to visit and found Campbell \"in bed discouraged to the limit.\" Kivett said, \"Why are you in bed? You're a Campbell. Get a hump on you.\" Kivett also made a pledge to J.A. Campbell to construct a new stronger, sturdier brick building on the campus. Over the next 478 days, he oversaw and supervised nearly every aspect of the academy's reconstruction, from drawing plans and making brick to sawing the lumber and mixing sand and lime. Within the first few days alone, he had developed the plans to renovate the tabernacle so it could be temporarily used for classroom space; he had arranged for wagons to deliver lumber; and he had brought in carpenters to get to work.\n\nBy January 8, 1901, the tabernacle was open to classes. \"A steam engine in britches\" and \"a grand old man,\" Kivett had been called.\n\nIn November 1903, the new brick building had been erected at a cost of $30,000. The completion of the Kivett Building brought new life to the school. The 1909 catalog noted, \"It is built of beautiful brick, made on our own grounds, and is an everlasting monument to the love, loyalty, and sacrifices of our friends ... [who] are in itself a constant inspiration to live something high and noble, and to undertake the impossible.\" The catalog added that Buies Creek Academy and Business College was \"a leading preparatory school with military features, business, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy, art, music and normal departments.\n\nWorld War I and the \"Great Influenza Outbreak\" of 1918 had a significant impact on the Academy and the Buies Creek community. According to Dr. Bruce Blackmon, the influenza outbreak also inflicted a serious toll on some families — \"If you saw a house and there was no smoke coming out of its chimney, that was an indication that the person responsible for heating the home was no longer alive.\"\n\nElectric lights came to the campus in 1918. J.A. Campbell secured a $60,000 donation from Mr. B.N. Duke in 1927 to establish modern water and sewage facilities on the campus.\n\nThere were 620 students enrolled in the school in 1923, and the first dormitory for boys was completed that year. It later became known as Layton Dormitory.\n\nAccording to J. Winston Pearce, \"The evening of September 26, 1923, was a significant date for the life of the school.\" That evening D. Rich – treasurer of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company – spent the night in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Campbell, and that morning they asked how he had slept. He replied, \"I slept very little,\" He continued, \"No, I did not sleep well. Jesus and I talked together most of the night, and Jesus told me 'Buies Creek must live.'\" Rich died the following year and left one eighth of his estate to the academy. He also provided $60,000 for the construction of Carrie Rich Memorial Library in honor of his first wife, as well as the first brick gymnasium and the D. Rich Memorial Building, completed in 1926. These new facilities, as well as competition from the new high schools that were being completed across the state in the 1920s, provided incentives for the Academy to become a junior college.\n\nAt the annual Baptist State Convention Meeting in Wilmington in 1925, J.A. Campbell sold his interest in the Academy (appraised at $56,000) to the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina for $28,000; the school was then valued at more than $500,000. The Board of Education of the Baptist State Convention recommended unanimously that Buies Creek Academy become a junior college, beginning with the 1927–28 academic session.\n\nAt that meeting, the Reverend A. C. Hamby made the motion to change the name from Buies Creek Academy to Campbell College, in honor of its founder. Dean D. B. Bryan of Wake Forest College approved of the name change, and Wake Forest College bestowed on J.A. Campbell the honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in 1926.\n\nJ.A. Campbell died at the age of 72 in 1934. At Campbell's funeral, Dr. Charles E. Maddry of the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention proclaimed, \"Dr. Campbell was a great servant of God because he early had a divine experience of the saving power of Christ. Because of [Campbell's] great love for others, he literally wore himself out serving them, giving poor boys and girls the chance of an education ... He always saw a future of service in his boys and girls.\"\n\nLeslie Hartwell \"L.H.\" Campbell (1892–1970), the oldest son of the founder J.A. Campbell, was the unanimous choice by the Board of Trustees to succeed his father. Leslie was eight years old when the academy burned in December 1900. He remembered attending classes in the converted tabernacle when the Kivett Building was under construction. He graduated from Buies Creek Academy in 1908 and enrolled in Wake Forest College, along with his younger brother Carlyle.\n\nUpon his father's death in 1934, L. H. Campbell at the age of forty-two became the youngest college president in North Carolina. During his long, 33-year tenure as president, he guided the college through many challenges and economic struggles, especially the Depression and World War II. At his 1935 inauguration as the second president of Campbell, he said, \"The events of this hour constitute only a link between a past set with marvelous achievement and a future calling for our wholehearted endeavor.\" He concluded his address stating, \"This is no coronation day. Rather, it witnesses the solemn dedication and surrender of all it is in us to a holy cause.\"\n\nLeslie's major achievement was to expand the institution following World War II, steering Campbell to become a fully accredited co-educational Baptist-affiliated liberal arts and vocational college. Like his father before him, he encouraged students to pursue higher education in spite of economic hardships.\n\nThe only campus building constructed in the 1930s was the Dining Hall. It was built in 1933 to accommodate four-hundred students, and was later named for the college's longtime business manager, B.P. Marshbanks Sr.\n\nPaul Green, a 1912 Buies Creek Academy alumnus and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, helped establish the Paul Green Theater, located between the D. Rich Administration Building and the Gym in 1934. in 1937, Campbell was the only junior college in North Carolina to offer courses in drama and journalism for college credit.\n\nDuring World War II, the enrollment on campus declined from 700 students to around 400. Like many other colleges throughout the country, intercollegiate athletic programs such as football, baseball, basketball, track, and tennis were temporarily suspended during the war years. When many male students went off to fight, space for female boarding students was at a premium; and Layton Annex, which had housed males, was turned over to women. The war also affected food supplies on campus. \n\"I remember the day the war was formally declared. President Leslie Campbell got the entire student body into one of the large rooms at D. Rich, and had a radio in there. He turned it on, and we heard, live, President Roosevelt declare war.\" — Dorothea Stewart Gilbert ('46)\n\nBy 1957, the enrollment on the main campus reached 1,023 students, and more residential facilities were added to the campus. In 1961, the James A. Campbell Administration Building was dedicated and Bryan Hall for women opened \"as a cluster of 12 one-story apartment units grouped around an exterior wall\" that could house 200 students. Strickland Hall opened in 1962 to accommodate 132 women, and E. P. Sauls Hall opened that same year to house 131 men. A major building completed on the campus was the 44,000-square-foot Leslie Campbell Hall of Science. This three-story structure originally housed the departments of physics, biology, and chemistry, as well as home economics.\n\nCampbell College achieved senior-college status in 1961. In a speech he delivered on Founder's Day on March 6 of that year, President Campbell said: \"On this observance of Founder's Day we stand on a pinnacle from which we have seen in retrospect glimpses of the unfolding drama of this institution for the past 74 years–drama filled with intense human struggle, accompanied here and there with temporary reverses with groping, frequently toward some promised land of destiny, partially 'hidden behind the ranges'; but thank God, with occasional vistas of inviting new tablelands of thrilling achievement just beyond [...] The transformation of Campbell into a senior college is a far more meaningful and involved process than superimposing the junior and senior years upon the already established junior college. Just as the transition from old Buies Creek Academy to a junior college, begun in 1926, in many respects involved the rebirth of the institution, and so now becoming a senior college will result in many modifications in administrative policy and in the program of the institution.\"\n\nLocated in the Sandhills of southeastern North Carolina, the university is nestled in the small unincorporated village of Buies Creek near the Cape Fear River. The Buies Creek census-designated place population was only 2,215 in the 2000 census and the surrounding area remains rural. However, Buies Creek is approximately south of Raleigh, the state capital, North Carolina's second-largest city, and approximately north of Fayetteville, North Carolina's sixth-largest city.\n\nThe center of campus is Academic Circle, which fronts Leslie Campbell Avenue to the south. Academic Circle is a grass thoroughfare, laced with sidewalks and magnolia trees that is surrounded on the south by dormitories Kitchin Hall (1955) and Baldwin Hall (1958) and along the north by the Frederick L. Taylor Hall of Religion (1973) (Campbell University Divinity School), D. Rich Memorial Building (1923), Kivett Hall (1903) (formerly Law School), Wiggins Hall (1993) (formerly Law School), Butler Chapel (2009) and Britt Hall (1947) (campus bookstore).\n\nNorth of Academic Circle the buildings flank the newly developed Fellowship Commons, a series of brick sidewalks and gathering places that connect the campus from the west on T.T. Lanier Street to the east on Main Street. In this part of campus are Marshbanks Dining Hall (1934), Leslie H. Campbell Hall of Science (1961), J.P. Riddle Pharmacy Center (1991), Maddox Hall (2007) (Pharmacy School), Pearson Hall (1915), Carrie Rich Memorial Library (1925), Carter Gymnasium (1952) and James A. Campbell Administration Building (1961).\n\nBeyond Fellowship Commons lies the north campus which contains several residence halls along with the Taylor Bott Rogers Fine Arts Center (1984) and the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business (1999). East of Main Street are more of Campbell's athletic facilities including Jim Perry Stadium (baseball), Johnson Memorial Natatorium (swimming), and the John W. Pope, Jr. Convocation Center as well as the Buies Creek post office.\n\nSouth of Leslie Campbell Avenue are more residence halls, including the new student apartments in Barker Hall (2005). South of U.S. Highway 421 are athletic fields and Barker–Lane Stadium. The newly constructed 96,000 sq. ft. Leon Levine Hall of Medical Science across Highway 421 hosts the new School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Physician Assistant Program.\n\nCampbell offers over 100 tracks and concentrations; master's programs in business, education, pharmaceutical science, clinical research and divinity; and professional programs in law, pharmacy, physician assistant, physical therapy, and medicine. The University also makes study abroad and other special programs available. In 2012, the undergraduate acceptance rate was reported at 40.5%. Along with Campbell's premier undergraduate programs, the school has also achieved renown for its graduate programs. Since its establishment in 1986, Campbell University School of Pharmacy, now College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, has maintained a 99 percent passage rate on both state and national exams. In ten of the last sixteen years, Campbell Pharmacy students have achieved a 100 percent passage rate on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX).\n\nThe School of Law Class of 2006 scored a 97% passage rate on July's North Carolina Bar Exam, topping all other law schools in the state. Campbell University's Norman A. Wiggins School of Law was featured in the Princeton Review's 2007 edition of the \"Best 170 Law Schools\" publication. Graduates of the School of Law have frequently led in passage rates on the North Carolina Bar Exam since the school's establishment in 1976, including a 100 percent passage rate in 1994, the first time all members of a graduation class accomplished that feat in North Carolina history.\n\nThe School of Law Class of 2015 had an unemployment rate of 17% and 50% of 2015 graduates had obtained long term full-time as an attorney 9 months after graduation, according to statistics provided by the ABA.\n\nThe Campbell University Divinity school offers both undergraduate and graduate level degrees. The Divinity School officially opened on August 19, 1996. Thirty-five founding students enrolled the first year of the Divinity school. These students constituted the Charter Class of eighty-four students.\n\nThe Lundy-Fetterman School of Business offers a joint MBA with Pharm.D., J.D., and M.Div. students. Also, undergraduate business students have the option of electing to stay a fifth year to earn a joint BBA/MBA. Campbell is a dynamic institution in the wealth management industry by offering a one-of-a-kind degree, the Bachelor of Business Administration in Trust and Wealth Management. Banks and financial institutions from around the country court Campbell students for paid summer internships and for permanent hire upon graduation. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business also offers one of twenty PGA accredited golf programs in the United States.\n\nIn August 2011, the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences launched a master's degree in Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS). One year later, it began a Master of Science in Public Health degree program. The University is also seeking accreditation for a new Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program with a projected start date of January 2014. The University's newest school, the School of Osteopathic Medicine, welcomed its first class in August 2013. The mission of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) is to educate and prepare community-based osteopathic physicians in a Christian environment to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States and the nation.\n\nCampbell University also has an Adult and Online Education program with an online campus and campuses at Fort Bragg, NC, Camp Lejeune, NC and RTP in Raleigh, NC. Campbell University's Online Education program was established as a pilot program in 1999. The program originated at the Camp Lejeune Campus and became a separate program in 2004, relocating to the Main Campus.\n\nCampbell University fields 20 NCAA Division I sports. As of the 2011–2012 academic year, the Camels rejoined the Big South Conference after a 17-year hiatus during which they served as a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference. The Lady Camels' swim team is a member of the Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association (CCSA). The men's wrestling team is an associate member of the Southern Conference.\n\nMen's sports\n\nWomen's sports\n\n\nCampbell completed the John W. Pope Convocation Center, an athletic complex for basketball, volleyball and wrestling. The facility houses a game basketball court, practice basketball court, practice wrestling room, varsity weight room, student fitness center, plethora of locker rooms, and the Department of Exercise Science. The wrestling team and the volleyball team both have matches and games on the main basketball court.\n\nThe \"Pine Burr\" is Campbell University's yearbook, published every year in the spring and given out to the students before final exams.\n\n\"The Lyricist\" is Campbell University's literary magazine, featuring poetry and prose from students and statewide contributors.\n\"The Campbell Times\" is the student newspaper at the university and is published bi-monthly during the spring and fall semesters.\n\nWCCE-FM is an FM radio station broadcasting on frequency 90.1 that was signed on by the university on October 7, 1974. Campbell sold the station in 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

It was revised in May 1939 and again on 13 September 2017. The flag's proportions are 1:2 in a symmetric cross.\n\nThe flag consists of a red symmetric cross with a red disc in the centre, as well as five emblems representing the ancestral presence of Indigenous peoples and the four main European ethnic groups that were settled in the city in the 19th century, and which are also represented on the Canadian Red Ensign.\n\nMontreal's flag is based on its coat of arms. The original coat of arms was designed in 1833 by the first mayor of Montreal, Jacques Viger. It was similar to the current version with the difference that the red cross was a saltire, a beaver stood in the place of what is now a fleur-de-lys, and there was no white pine. The arms were revised on 21 March 1938.\n\nFour years prior to the first raising of the revised flag, King George V, the sovereign of Canada, celebrated his Silver Jubilee (25th year on the throne) on Monday May 6, 1935. An article in the Montreal Gazette from May 3, 1935 reported that the city’s Jubilee committee had discovered a rule whereby official coats of arms of British corporations could be interpreted into flag banners. Per the article, Montreal prepared to raise its own distinct flag for the first time ever on the King’s Jubilee day based on the original coat of arms by Jacques Viger.\n\nIn May 1939, the flag was revised to display a symmetric cross instead of a saltire, as well as a blue fleur-de-lys instead of a beaver.\n\nOn February 12, 2017, the Mayor of Montreal Denis Coderre announced a modification to the flag of Montreal to include a First Nations symbol. The decision was made in 2017 during the city's 375th anniversary of the founding of the city. The symbol was chosen by the First Nations communities of Montreal, those being Haudenosaunee and Algonquin although there are large Inuit, Métis and Anishinaabeg populations.\n\n"}
{"id": "2160269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160269", "title": "Jackknifing", "text": "Jackknifing\n\nJackknifing refers to the folding of an articulated vehicle so that it resembles the acute angle of a folding pocket knife. If a vehicle towing a trailer skids, the trailer can push the towing vehicle from behind until it spins the vehicle around and faces backwards. This may be caused by equipment failure, improper braking, or adverse road conditions such as an icy road surface. In extreme circumstances, a driver may attempt to jackknife the vehicle deliberately in order to halt it following brake failure.\n\nWhen a trailer skids to one side, this is known as a trailer swing or trailer slew. This could happen on a slippery road surface, often where there is a cant. This is not the same as \"jackknifing\" and is not as serious since the trailer moves back into line as the vehicle continues forwards. The driver must be aware, however, that the trailer could slide up against parked cars or a guard rail, or the wheels could slide into a ditch. This situation can occur especially when the trailer is empty or lightly loaded, and weather conditions cause violent gusts of crosswind.\n\n\n"}

Discussions to form the company were held at The Lambs, a famous theater club where Charles and Daniel Frohman were members. The company advertised \"Famous Players in Famous Plays\" and its first release was the French film \"Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth\" (1912) starring Sarah Bernhardt and Lou Tellegen. Its first actual production was \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1912, released 1913), directed by Edwin S. Porter and starring James O'Neill, the father of dramatist Eugene O'Neill.\n\nIn 1914, the company purchased the former headquarters of New York City's Ninth Mounted Cavalry unit at 221 West 26th Street in Manhattan. The cavernous brick building made excellent filming space for Zukor, and the modernized site is still used today as Chelsea Television Studios.\n\nHiring its performers straight from the New York stage, Famous Players had an early roster of some of the city's biggest names including Marguerite Clark, Hazel Dawn, and H. B. Warner. The company also featured cinema's biggest star of the era, Mary Pickford, and presented theater idol John Barrymore in his first two feature films. The company produced both short and feature-length productions. \n\nIn 1916, the company merged with the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company to form Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, which later became Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn 1915, the company established Famous Players Fiction Studios at 5300 Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. The new studio's first film starred Mary Pickford. The studio later became Clune Studio, then California Studio, then Gross-Krasne, followed by Producers Studios Inc., and is now known as Raleigh Studios. Raleigh Studios is known for being the site of \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Perry Mason,\" and currently \"Let's Make a Deal\". It is one of the oldest studios in Hollywood.\n\n"}
{"id": "2160280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160280", "title": "San Joaquin antelope squirrel", "text": "San Joaquin antelope squirrel\n\nThe San Joaquin antelope squirrel or Nelson's antelope squirrel (\"Ammospermophilus nelsoni\"), is a species of antelope squirrel, in the San Joaquin Valley of the U.S. state of California.\n\nThe San Joaquin antelope squirrel is found in the San Joaquin Valley, including slopes and ridge tops along the western edge of the valley. It is endemic to the region, and is found in a much smaller range today than it originally inhabited. Since the San Joaquin Valley fell under heavy agricultural cultivation, habitat loss combined with rodenticide use has reduced the squirrels numbers enough that it is now listed as a threatened species.\n\nMost of today's remaining San Joaquin antelope squirrels can be found in the Carrizo Plain, where their original habitat remains undisturbed. The squirrels live in small underground familial colonies on sandy, easily excavated grasslands in isolated locations in San Luis Obispo and Kern Counties. Common vegetation associated with the squirrel includes \"Atriplex\" and \"Ephedra\", and some junipers. The binomial of this species commemorates the American naturalist Edward William Nelson.\n\nThe San Joaquin antelope squirrel is dull yellowish-brown or buffy-clay in color on upper body and outer surfaces of the legs with a white belly and a white streak down each side of its body in the fashion of other antelope squirrels. The underside of the tail is a buffy white with black edges. Males are approximately 9.8 inches and females are approximately 9.4 inches in length.\n\nStudies by Hawbecker provide abundant information on breeding and the life cycle of Nelson's antelope squirrel. They breed in late winter to early spring and have nearly all their young in March. Once pregnant, gestation lasts a little less than a month. The young do not emerge from their dens until approximately the first week of April. Nelson's antelope squirrel has only one breeding season, which is timed appropriately so that the young are born during the time of year when green vegetation is the most abundant.\n\nWeaning is thought to start or be completed even before the young emerge. Once above ground, young are seen foraging for food independently. During the weaning period, the mother feeds alone and ignores any attempt of the young trying to nuzzle or nurse from her. A mother will sometimes spend the night in a different den if necessary. By early to mid-May the young squirrels have had their juvenile pelage for some time and begin to show the changes into adult pelage. By summer, the adult pelage is present. Once an individual has reached adulthood it is difficult to tell differences in age. Nelson's antelope squirrel is a short-lived species that often does not survive to a year. However, several individuals have been observed to live more than four years in the wild.\n\nColonies have about six or eight individuals, however these individuals are not distributed evenly across their range. There is usually about 1 per hectare. Nelson's antelope squirrel prefers deep, rich soil types since they are easy to dig through in both winter and summer temperatures. Although these squirrels may dig for food, they do not make their own burrows. Instead they claim abandoned \"Dipodomys\" (kangaroo rats) burrows as their own. Both males and females have the same size home range of about 4.4 hectare. Of course, there are areas of concentration within this range where the squirrels spend the majority of their time.\n\nIt is omnivorous, feeding on seeds, green vegetation, insects, and dried animal matter. It occasionally caches food. Redstem fialree (\"Erodium cicutarium\") and brome grass (\"Bromus rubens\") are important food items for the squirrels. However, their diet may differ depending on the time of day or time of year. Green vegetation is the most common diet type from December to mid-April because it is the most abundant during this period. Likewise, insects make up more than 90% of the squirrel's diet from mid-April to December because they are more abundant. Although seeds are available for most of the year, it is not the preferable diet of the squirrels. They will choose insects or green vegetation when available over seeds, even if the seeds are more abundant and easier to access. Some speculate that this could be due to the higher amount of water in insects and green vegetation, which would be necessary for the species to survive in such a hot, dry climate. Unfortunately for the Nelson's antelope squirrel, there is not an abundant water source nearby. Under laboratory conditions, the squirrels readily accept water. However, they can also survive at least 7 months in the shade without water. At the end of 7 months they appeared relatively healthy and not at all emaciated.\n\nNelson's antelope squirrels are social animals. When individually taken out of their home range and released in an unknown area, they seem helpless and confused. They do not expend much energy throughout the day because of the extreme temperatures in their environment. In fact, when in the direct sunlight, a temperature of 31-32 °C can kill them. Therefore, there is little activity from the squirrels during the heat of the day. Although there is no evidence of hibernation, the squirrels are not bothered by the cold and can survive temperatures below freezing, in their burrows. They are not early risers and are usually not seen until after sunrise, however it does forage in the morning and evening, avoiding the midday heat. Around noon the squirrels disappear into their burrows and are not seen again until about 2 pm at the earliest. On moderate days, the squirrels will take their time foraging, in contrast to bringing as much food back to their burrows as quickly as possible on hot or cold days. The squirrels are also known to fully stretch out and roll over in the dust on the ground. These dust baths appear to be very enjoyable activities for the squirrels and may also be used to prevent infestation of parasites.\n\nNelson's antelope squirrels are cautious when emerging from their burrows. They have a specific route that they follow when foraging for food. If danger seems near, they will run into a burrow along their foraging route to get to safety. They move quickly and do not spend much time in one place. They are particular about what they choose to eat and very rarely even waste time to pick up food they are not interested in. There are other features in addition to their quick movements that help keep them from danger. They whitish color of the underside of their tail can be seen when they run. The squirrels will curl their tail forward over their back and flick and twitch it back and forth as it runs. This movement can present the illusion of thistledown fluttering in the wind, which could be ignored by any potential predators.\n\nTo further help prevent predation, the Nelson's antelope squirrel has an alarm call. These alarm calls are not loud, but associated with convulsive body movements. Horned larks and the white-crowned sparrow also aid in predator detection. Squirrels will listen to alarm calls given by these two birds. The badger (\"Taxidea taxus\") is a main predator of Nelson's antelope squirrel and will destroy burrows to get its meal. Coyotes (\"Canis latrans\") and San Joaquin Valley Kit Fox (\"Vulpes macrotis mutica\") are also known to consume the squirrels, but they are not a main part of their diet.\n\nIncreasing agriculture and urban development is an increasing problem for Nelson's antelope squirrel. This species will not colonize cultivated land. Therefore, an increase in agriculture land is taking away their habitat and leaving them with no alternative. Grazing livestock further destroys what habitat may be left, and exotic plants are able to take over native grasses that the squirrel forages upon and relies on for shade and cover. Also, pesticide drift from nearby agricultural fields encroaches in on the existing squirrel habitat. Not only are these practices affecting the population of the Nelson's antelope squirrel, but they are also causing problems for other native animal and plant species in the San Joaquin Valley. Native plant species such as the kern mallow, San Joaquin woolly threads, California jewelflower, and Bakersfield cactus are all federally endangered plant species that are being outcompeted by invasive plant species. Many invasive plants grow in very dense patches. These dense patches are not adequate habitats for Nelson's antelope squirrel and many other San Joaquin Valley Species.\n\nThere have been attempts to manage the invasive species and other anthropogenic causes to species decline in the San Joaquin Valley. Prescribed burns are one option to control invasive plant species, however this method can cause native species to also be killed and can be expensive. Studies determining the effects of cattle grazing on the land are also being done so that plans can be developed to reduce the impact on the land. Suggestions of using prescribed grazing to help reduce the growth of non-native species in the valley.\n\nOther control efforts include chemical and mechanical treatments, however these too can be time consuming and expensive, especially for large areas. Also, the use of herbicides could potentially negatively affect species in the San Joaquin Valley if there are significant winds that spread the chemicals. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has a recovery plan dated 1998 that includes the ideas of using Safe Harbor Agreements (SHA's) under Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act. This could potentially begin a relationship between the USFWS and the farm landowners to help determine the best compromise in order to manage the endangered species of the valley.\n\nA multispecies approach to conservation is important because of the increasing number of native species becoming threatened and endangered in the San Joaquin Valley. Management on an ecosystem level would allow the role of all the species to be taken into account. Also, an increase in awareness and education of the public around the Valley may further help increase funding for conservation and management plans. Monitoring and studying of the species is needed to determine just how threatened the species is and what needs to be done to reestablish stable populations in the valley.\n\nUnfortunately, most information found on the Nelson's antelope squirrel discuss the problems and reasons of declines, but do not give much insight on the potential recovery of the species. Even in 1918, Grinnell and Dixon believed it to only be a matter of time before the species faces extinction.\n\n"}

It states that it is an \"international membership organization whose members use both L. Ron Hubbard management technology and embrace the responsibilities and ethical standards of WISE membership.\"\n\nHubbard said about the early Churches of Scientology: \"They are not business and so fail when they try to operate like one\". He then began creating a new system of organizing these churches with the stated purpose of \"Disseminating Scientology to the world\"; this new system was modified continually until about 1980. In the late '60s, a project began compiling his notes into hard bound volumes that later became known as the Organization Executive Course, or OEC. Originally intended as a training program for church executives (hence the name), Hubbard later made them available to all church staff and stated that all staff should train on them.\n\nHowever, the OEC was stated to work for any kind of organization. Businesses not connected to the church wishing to improve their own success reportedly began hiring trained church staff in the '70s, causing problems within the church. In the 1980s, Hubbard created WISE with the intention of giving any non-church related organization a means to train their own staff, so that Scientology churches and missions could train their staff without fear of losing them to other groups. \n\nWISE was officially incorporated in 1979.\n\n\nMembership in WISE means that the owner(s) of the firm have embraced Hubbard's administrative ideas such as management by statistics and the Org board and have agreed to abide by a certain Code of Ethics which includes arbitration by a WISE mediator of any disputes with another WISE member. That is the basic company membership. If the firm also wants to train its employees in the Hubbard administrative technology using WISE materials then they become a higher-level member by paying a pre-determined amount of money to WISE. Some employees and prospective employees have objected to this formal training in that it is something that is also a part of Scientology and a number have filed discrimination lawsuits with mixed results.\n\nWISE Members include e-Republic, which publishes \"Government Technology\" and \"Converge\" magazines and coordinates the \"Center for Digital Government\". Other affiliated firms include various \"alternative health\" centers including \"The Natural Health Centre\" in Redondo Beach, CA which is owned and operated by Dr. Grace Syn. WISE ANZO members include Gallop Solutions based in Sydney, Australia.\n\nA number of firms use the WISE administrative technology in their practices and there have been a number of civil suits and discrimination cases brought by employees objecting to the material with mixed results:\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard listing 21 moral precepts. The booklet is distributed by The Way to Happiness Foundation International, a Scientology-related nonprofit organization founded in 1984.\n\n\"The Way to Happiness\" is used as part of Scientology's Criminon rehabilitation program and is promoted by Scientology celebrities. The unsolicited distribution of personalised copies of the booklet to schools and mayors' offices has caused controversy, and while it is promoted as secular in nature, critics have stated that it includes ideas that are specific to Scientology, and is used as a recruiting tool. The booklet has been translated into 70 languages.\n\nThe Way to Happiness Foundation International is a non-profit 501(c)(3), incorporated in 1984. Headquartered at 201 East Broadway, Glendale, California, the foundation coordinates the activities of the Way to Happiness international network, including continental and national officies, associates and local groups. The Way to Happiness Foundation International is a division of the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), and is a \"Scientology-related entity\" under the 1993 IRS Closing Agreement.\n\nThe \"Way to Happiness\" booklet contains a set of 21 precepts, which were written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The precepts are: 1.Take Care of Yourself, 2. Be Temperate, 3. Don't Be Promiscuous, 4. Love and Help Children, 5. Honor and Help your Parents, 6. Set a Good Example, 7. Seek to Live with the Truth, 8. Do Not Murder, 9. Don’t Do Anything Illegal, 10. Support a Government Designed and Run for all the People, 11. Do not Harm a Person of Good Will, 12. Safeguard and Improve Your Environment, 13. Do Not Steal, 14. Be Worthy of Trust, 15. Fulfill Your Obligations, 16. Be Industrious, 17. Be Competent, 18. Respect the Religious Beliefs of Others, 19. Try Not to Do Things to Others That You Would Not Like Them to Do to You, 20. Try to Treat Others as You Would Want Them to Treat You, 21. Flourish and Prosper. The code is not limited to negative prohibition of actions that are bad, (stealing, killing, promiscuity, illegalities) but also the positive advisement of good actions (“care of oneself, temperateness, respect for parents, aid for children, truthfulness, safeguard of environment, etc.”) It was first published in 1981 by Regent House, Los Angeles as a 48-page paper-covered booklet (). This book is frequently given out by Scientologists. A campaign in the early 1990s to distribute the book in United States schools was described in Church of Scientology publications as \"the largest dissemination project in Scientology history\" and \"the bridge between broad society and Scientology.\" A song titled \"The Way to Happiness\" appears on the music album \"The Road to Freedom\", with music and lyrics by Hubbard.\n\n\"The Way to Happiness\" forms the core of the Church of Scientology prison program Criminon. It is also used in the Scientology-affiliated organization Narconon - all clients receive a pamphlet of \"The Way to Happiness\" when they begin the program. Volunteer Ministers, a Scientology-affiliated organization which responds to disaster scenes, distributes \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlets, and did so in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. The Scientology organization Concerned Businessmen's Association of America (CBAA) has also distributed \"The Way to Happiness\", though representatives of the group have denied connections to Scientology. A 1993 article in \"Newsweek\" described cases where schools in Bellflower, California and Brooklyn, New York were influenced by CBAA to use \"The Way to Happiness\" in their schools, without knowing of the connections to Scientology. A 1990 \"Los Angeles Times\" article described the situation of a school in Fresno, California, where CBAA representatives refused to sponsor a contest at the school if \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlet was not distributed.\nThe booklet has been distributed to hotels.\n\nScientologist Nancy Cartwright, the voice actor for Bart Simpson, mailed 1 million copies of \"The Way to Happiness\" booklet to residents of San Fernando Valley, California in December 2007. Cartwright told the \"Daily News of Los Angeles\": \"The mailing was from me to the San Fernando Valley community, the highest gang-infested area of Los Angeles. I thought it would make an impact, give someone a tool in order to make their lives happier at home.\" Isaac Hayes distributed \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlets at his jazz performances in 2005.\n\nTom Cruise has distributed \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlets, and passed out brochures embossed with his name at the elementary school where the 2005 movie \"War of the Worlds\" was filmed. He also gave copies of the pamphlet to managers of United International Pictures, the company which distributed \"War of the Worlds\" overseas. In a Church of Scientology-produced promotional video which appeared on YouTube in January 2008, Cruise cites \"the way to happiness\" as one of the benefits of Scientology: \"When you're a Scientologist and you drive by an accident, you know you have to do something about it, because you know you're the only one who can really help,\" said Cruise. \"We are the way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures.\" Actor Miles Fisher parodies this quote by Cruise, in a scene in the 2008 film \"Superhero Movie\". Fisher's character in the film states that he can \"eat planets\" and that he is \"the way to happiness\".\n\nThe Church of Scientology offers two courses based on \"The Way to Happiness\": \"The Way to Happiness Course\", done at a Church organization or mission and \"The Way to Happiness Extension Course\", which can be done at home. There is also the \"Happiness Rundown\" which is a Scientology procedure of a \"Rundown\" including auditing.\n\nIn 1992, teachers in Anchorage, Alaska found copies of \"The Way to Happiness\" in their school mailboxes accompanied by a letter inviting the teachers to order more copies and distribute them to their students. Parents complained to the school district, and the school districts director of secondary education, Bill Mell, instructed school principals to tell teachers not to order \"The Way to Happiness\". Mell told the \"Anchorage Daily News\": \"I don't know that it went to every teacher ... It looks as if they got a hold of the teachers' mailing list.\" A local businessman and Scientologist who was a member of the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America organization paid for the books to be distributed to the schools, and told the \"Anchorage Daily News\" that he believed both \"The Way to Happiness\" and the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America were not affiliated with the Church of Scientology.\n\nAt a 2005 fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Clearwater, Florida, attendants found \"The Way to Happiness\" booklets in their goodie bags. The booklets contained the insignia of Boys & Girls Clubs on the front cover, and instructions on the back cover stating that additional copies could be obtained at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast facilities. Carl Lavender, executive director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast, said that this usage of the Boys & Girls Clubs was unauthorized: \"...I'm not pleased. You can't produce materials with our logo on it unless I give permission. We are going to collect all of them back and have them discarded.\" Joanie Sigal of the Scientology volunteer group Clearwater Community Volunteers, and a member of the Clearwater Boys & Girls Club's board of managers, had originally suggested adding the Club's insignia and distributing the booklets, and requested that the corporate board officially endorse the booklet. Executive director Lavender denied the request, stating: \"The booklet ends as of today ... There needs to be a lesson. This cannot happen.\"\n\nIn 2005, Commander Mike Downing of the Los Angeles Police Department complained that \"the Church of Scientology forged his endorsement on The Way To Happiness Web site, prompting the LAPD to disavow any endorsement of Scientology and The Way To Happiness.\" \n\nIn 2007, The Way to Happiness Foundation produced and distributed pamphlets with sample endorsements from the mayors of Dallas, Texas and San Francisco, California. The books were sent to mayor's offices, accompanied by a letter asking mayors to purchase copies of the books for distribution in their city. The mayor of Dallas did not appreciate this unauthorized usage of the mayor's logo and the official seal of the city of Dallas, stating: \"Clearly we were not very comfortable and did not think it was appropriate to use the seal of the city of Dallas, the mayor's logo or my name on something we were not aware of.\" According to a report in \"The Dallas Morning News\", the city attorney's office of Dallas looked into possible options of response regarding the matter.\nSimilarly, in San Francisco, California, the mayor's office also received a boxful of the booklets and voiced displeasure with the unauthorized usage of the mayor's image, logo, and the seal of the city. According to a report by the Associated Press, the city ordered the Scientology group to stop using an unauthorized picture of Mayor Gavin Newsom on its promotional pamphlets. An official spokesman for the mayor of San Francisco released a statement, saying: \"The mayor does not support the unauthorized use of his image or the city seal on this booklet.\" The city attorney for San Francisco wrote a letter to \"The Way to Happiness Foundation\", citing California state law, which prohibits deceptive and misleading advertising that could create an appearance that the pamphlets are from a government agency. The city attorney also cited San Francisco law, writing that the Board of Supervisors must approve any commercial use of the city's official seal.\n\nIn Winnipeg, Manitoba a box of pamphlets was delivered to the mayor's office with the official City of Winnipeg logo and the image of mayor Sam Katz. No legal action was taken: \"This is obviously a sample sent to our office and it was not approved or paid for by our office... If material was being distributed on our behalf with a false endorsement, it would be a different story.\"\n\nIn a 2007 published US embassy cable, Ursula Caberta, the Director of the Working Group on Scientology (created by the Hamburg State Parliament to address all \"destructive groups\" which endanger society), obtained a booklet that contained the Hamburg mayor's photograph and signature, yet was actually a publication from The Way to Happiness Foundation. \nCaberta contended that \"Scientology regularly used misleading methods to fool individuals into joining and said that such booklets had been distributed to other German cities. For someone unfamiliar with Scientology publications, the booklet looked very much like information brochures from the City of Hamburg.\"\n\nIn October 2007, uniformed police officers visiting Whyalla High School in Australia distributed a booklet called \"Whyalla High School presents the way to happiness, a common-sense guide for better living\", against the school's guidelines for religious education. One parent told the Adelaide, Australia paper \"The Advertiser\" she had specifically told the school not to give religious instruction to her children, and other parents mistakenly thought that the booklets were distributed by the Education Department because Whyalla High School was displayed on the booklet's cover.\n\nIn March 2008, The Way to Happiness Foundation agreed to stop sending thousands of unsolicited, personalized copies of the booklet to elected officials in Florida after hundreds of them complained. Booklets sent to mayors had the mayor's name on the front, and an endorsement from the mayor on the back, along with the Florida state flag and the address of the town hall. A note advised prospective readers to contact town hall if they had further questions. The Foundation said it had sent about 2,800 mailings, comprising a total of 250,000 booklets, to Florida mayors, businesses and community groups. Following the complaints, the Foundation explained that the books were only samples meant to encourage the recipients to buy further copies, and said that it would henceforth send out unpersonalized stock copies only. Unlike many mayors who were reported to have been displeased at seeing their names on the personalized samples, Anthony Masiello, the mayor of Buffalo from 1994 to 2005, did authorize distribution of the booklet, complete with the city seal and a picture of the city hall, after a Scientology center opened in Buffalo in 2003.\n\nIn a speech given at a New Year's event in 2007, David Miscavige, the current leader of the Church of Scientology, claimed that the distribution of the booklet is aided by \"corporate tie-ins\", mentioning 7-Eleven in Taiwan, Coca-Cola Pakistan, Philips Electronics in Pakistan, and Dell in Africa as companies who supported the Foundation as part of their efforts to address their \"third-world image problems\". A video of the speech was released to YouTube in February 2008. A spokesman for Dell told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that they had researched the matter with their colleagues in Africa and elsewhere and found \"no evidence that this is accurate ... it's not our practice to disseminate religious materials of any kind.\" Representatives from Philips and 7-Eleven told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that they were unaware of any such association, but said they were looking into the matter.\n\n\"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlet caused controversy in Sderot, Israel in February 2008, when a group calling itself the \"Association for Prosperity and Security in the Middle East\" became active in the city. The non-profit group sent e-mails to social workers in Sderot, offering to help people cope with Kassam rocket attacks the city has been enduring. Dalia Yosef, head of an umbrella psychological organization in the region called Hosen Center, received complaints from multiple social workers about the e-mails, and stated: \"We intend to investigate this association, as we do every group that offers social and psychological services in Sderot\". In an e-mail response to \"The Jerusalem Post\", the Association for Prosperity stated: \"We are unaware of any Scientology activity whatsoever being offered to Sderot residents. In general, regarding your question on Scientology activity in Sderot or elsewhere, you should contact the official representatives of the religion and receive their response\".\n\nA representative of Scientology told \"The Jerusalem Post\" that the director-general of the Association for Prosperity was a Scientologist, as were most individuals in the organization, but that some were not, and said that the principles found in \"The Way to Happiness\" were \"totally different\" from Scientology. The organization stated: \"Claiming our organization is connected with Scientology just because our director-general studied Scientology is like saying that other nonprofits are hi-tech because volunteers work in hi-tech.\" Director-general of the Israeli Center for Cult Victims Ayelet Kedem described the organization as a front group for Scientology: \"Hiding behind a front organization is a common tactic... The idea is to create a positive image by obscuring the connection with Scientology... Later, people who undergo free workshops are convinced that they must correct flaws in their personality by taking Scientology courses. Those who are hooked end up giving all their possessions to the Church of Scientology\".\n\nIn Illinois in 2011, Rep. Dan Burke (D-Chicago) sponsored a resolution endorsing the \"Good Choices\" program, which is based on \"The Way to Happiness\", as one of a number of suitable tools for teaching character, morals and values. Actress Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson and a Scientologist, submitted testimony to a House education committee, stating the program had \"nothing to do with religion.\" Opponents voiced concerns about the program's links to the Scientology belief system, and said that promoting its use in schools would violate the principle of the separation of church and state. Burke accepted that the program's Scientology links were more substantial than he had thought. He said he would work on the resolution and present it again at a later date. The reporter stated, \"Not even the voice of Bart Simpson could convince Illinois lawmakers to approve a resolution aimed at teaching character in public schools because of its link to the Church of Scientology.\"\n\nThe Way to Happiness is described by the foundation as \"a non-religious moral code, based entirely on common sense, which is having profound effects around the world\". The religious scholar Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi states he has performed an extensive search in the history of religions, and has been unable to find a single case in which \"a religion was publicly propagating a secular version of its ethical system\". To illustrate the uniqueness of the booklet, he gave the following analogy: \"How about a secular, improved version of the Ten Commandments?\"\n\nThe text uses key words and concepts taken directly from Scientology beliefs – for example that \"survival\" is the fundamental point of life, that you can be truly happy if you become the \"cause\" of your own actions, and that the truth is \"what is true for you.\" A Brooklyn school principal who at first appreciated the booklet as \"a values-oriented book about righteousness and peace\" stopped using it after becoming aware that it contained \"an undercurrent of a religious nature.\"\n\nCritics argue that \"The Way to Happiness\" is primarily a recruiting tool for the church. According to Vicki Aznaran, former Inspector General of the Church's highest ecclesiastical organization, the Religious Technology Center, The Way to Happiness Foundation is \"a front group to get people into Scientology\" and the book is designed \"to make Scientology palatable to the masses.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "2160306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160306", "title": "Erlitou culture", "text": "Erlitou culture\n\nThe Erlitou culture was an early Bronze Age urban society and archaeological culture that existed in the Yellow River valley from approximately 1900 to 1500 BC. (A 2007 study of radiocarbon dating has proposed a narrower date range of 1750 to 1530 BC.) The culture was named after the site discovered at Erlitou in Yanshi, Henan. The culture was widely spread throughout Henan and Shanxi and later appeared in Shaanxi and Hubei. Chinese archaeologists generally identify the Erlitou culture as the site of the Xia dynasty, but there is no firm evidence, such as writing, to substantiate such a linkage.\n\nThe Erlitou culture may have evolved from the matrix of Longshan culture. Originally centered around Henan and Shanxi Province, the culture spread to Shaanxi and Hubei Province. After the rise of the Erligang culture, the site at Erlitou diminished in size but remained inhabited.\n\nDiscovered in 1959 by Xu Xusheng, Erlitou is the largest site associated with the culture, with palace buildings and bronze smelting workshops. Erlitou monopolized the production of ritual bronze vessels, including the earliest recovered dings. The city is on the Yi River, a tributary of the Luo River, which flows into the Yellow River. The city was 2.4 km by 1.9 km; however, because of flood damage only are left.\n\nThe Erlitou Relic Museum, located in Luoyang, Henan province, which has more than 2,000 items excavated from the Erlitou site in its collection, opened in October 2019.\n\nThe site is divided into four phases.\n\nDuring Phase I, covering , Erlitou was a rapidly growing regional center with estimated population of several thousand, but not yet an urban civilization.\n\nUrbanization began in Phase II, expanding to with a population around 11,000. A palace area of was demarcated by four roads. It contained the 150x50 m Palace 3, composed of three courtyards along a 150-meter axis, and Palace 5. A bronze foundry was established to the south of the palatial complex and was controlled by the elite.\n\nThe city reached its peak in Phase III, and may have had a population of around 24,000. The palatial complex was surrounded by a two-meter-thick rammed-earth wall, and Palaces 1, 7, 8, 9 were built. Palace 1, the largest, had an area of . Palaces 3 and 5 were abandoned and replaced by Palace 2, measuring , and Palace 4.\n\nIn Phase IV, the population decreased to around 20,000, but building continued. Palace 6 was built as an extension of Palace 2, and Palaces 10 and 11 were built. Phase IV overlaps with the Lower phase of the Erligang culture (1600–1450 BC). Around 1600 BC, a walled city was built at Yanshi, about northeast of Erlitou.\n\nProduction of bronzes and other elite goods ceased at the end of Phase IV, at the same time as the Erligang city of Zhengzhou was established to the east. There is no evidence of destruction by fire or war, but, during the Upper Erligang phase (1450–1300 BC), all the palaces were abandoned, and Erlitou was reduced to a village of .\n\nA major goal of archaeology in China has been the search for the capitals of the Xia and Shang dynasties described in traditional accounts as inhabiting the Yellow River valley. These originally oral traditions were recorded much later in histories such as the \"Bamboo Annals\" ( BC) and the \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (1st century BC), and their historicity, particularly regarding the Xia, is an area of debate for the Doubting Antiquity School of Chinese history. The discovery of writing in the form of oracle bones at Yinxu in Anyang definitively established the site as the last capital of the Shang, but such evidence is unavailable for earlier sites.\nWhen Xu Xusheng first discovered Erlitou, he suggested that it was Bo, the first capital of the Shang under King Tang in the traditional account. Since the late 1970s, archaeologists in China have tended to identify the site with Zhenxun, the last Xia capital. The traditional account of the overthrow of the Xia by the Shang has been identified with the ends of each of the four phases of the site by different authors. The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project identified all four phases of Erlitou as Xia, and the construction of the Yanshi walled city as the founding of the Shang. Other scholars, particularly outside China, point to the lack of any firm evidence for such an identification, and argue that the historiographical focus of Chinese archaeology is unduly limiting.\n\nArchaeological evidence of a large outburst flood that destroyed the Lajia site on the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been dated to about 1920 BC. This date is shortly before the rise of the Erlitou culture in the middle Yellow River valley and the Yueshi culture in Shandong, following the decline of the Longshan culture in the North China Plain. The authors suggest that this flood may have been the basis for the later myth, and contributed to the transition of cultures. They further argue that the timing is further evidence for the identification of the Xia with the Erlitou culture.\nHowever, no evidence of contemporaneous widespread flooding in the North China Plain has yet been found.\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160315", "title": "Andrew Salter", "text": "Andrew Salter\n\nAndrew Salter (May 9, 1914 – October 6, 1996) was the founder of conditioned reflex therapy, an early form of behaviour therapy which emphasized assertive and expressive behaviour as the way to combat the inhibitory personality traits which Salter believed were the underlying cause of most neuroses. In the 1940s, Salter introduced to American psychotherapy a Pavlovian model of hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis training.\n\nAndrew Salter received a BA from NYU, and was \"grand-fathered in\" as a practicing (Manhattan at 1000 Park Avenue at East 84th Street) psychologist with only a BA. Salter spoke seven languages fluently. He first made his mark clearing out the alcoholic's ward at New York's Bellevue Hospital by treating patients with hypnosis and teaching them self-hypnosis (autosuggestion).\n\nSalter was the first nationally recognized opponent of psychoanalysis. He was a dedicated critic of Freud. His book \"The Case Against Psychoanalysis\" was so controversial that the New York Times gave it two reviews, one extremely positive and one extremely negative.\n\nSalter proclaimed in this post-war tome, \"psychoanalysis has outlived its usefulness.\" Salter chucked psychoanalysis and replaced it with Pavlovian conditioning under hypnosis. In the conditioned reflex, he has seen the essence of hypnosis. He gave a rebirth to hypnotism by combining it with classical conditioning.\n\nAndrew Salter was and remains the most passionate opponent of Classical Freudian Psychoanalysis and believed that A. A. Brill (who was Sigmund Freud's official English translator) had \"homogenized\" Freud's work and deliberately omitted passages which Brill considered to be too radical, conflicting or bizarre. Salter spent three years studying everything Freud and his contemporaries had written, including correspondence with Carl Jung and Anna Freud, mostly in the original German before writing his \"autopsy\" of Psychoanalysis, \"The Case Against Psychoanalysis\" which today remains the best work ever written critiquing Freud's theories. Today's academic texts \"soft pedal\" many of Freud's theories, making Psychoanalysis more \"palatable\" due largely in part to Salter's works and those who came after him.\n\nSalter also brought attention to the fact that Pavlovian Psychology was a lot more than simple Classical Conditioning, citing the work done in Pavlov's Russian laboratory for over a quarter of a century. Salter is considered by many to be the \"father of behavior therapy\". Salter is certainly one of the first psychotherapists who adapted and applied learning theories to clinical practice.\n\nSalter believed in releasing personal \"inhibitions\" by practicing techniques leading to what he called \"excitation\" which results in \"disinhibition\", a state which he described as akin to being slightly drunk. Chapter 8 in \"Conditioned Reflex Therapy\" contains all of the \"exercises\" (like the deliberate use of the word \"I\") leading to a state of excitation. Today, excitation, a term from the Pavlovian lexicon, might be referred to as a combination of \"assertion\" and \"disinhibition\". Salter, as did other \"behaviorists\" of the time, also had his patients learn & practice Edmund Jacobson's technique of \"progressive relaxation\".\n\nSalter's hypnotic and relaxation techniques were first explained in his book, \"What Is Hypnosis?\" which was proclaimed a work of genius by Theodore X. Barber, a physiologist who researched hypnotic induction (Barber and Calverley) during the post World War II era.\n\nIn 1941, Salter published an article entitled 'Three techniques of autohypnosis'.\n\nSalter wrote an article describing the \"modus operandi\" of self-hypnosis but couldn't get it published. None of the professional journals would touch the piece. At length, after many rebuffs, he sent a copy to Professor Clark Leonard Hull, of Yale University's Psychology Department. Hull was the author of a work entitled \"Hypnosis and Suggestibility: An Experimental Approach\". Hull read Salter's article (though he had never heard of Salter) and was sufficiently impressed to send it along to the \"Journal of General Psychology\", of which he was an editor.\n\nSalter's technique was developed over the space of two years during which he tested the methods with just over 200 subjects. Salter described methods of teaching self-hypnosis by:\n\nSalter's behavioral approach, influenced by Hull, was a primitive precursor of modern hypnotic skills training programmes such as the Carleton Skills Training Programme developed by Nicholas Spanos.\n\nSalter is often considered to be the founder of assertiveness training, although he did not use the term himself. His book Conditioned Reflex Therapy (1949) describes many case studies in which he used primitive assertiveness techniques, termed \"excitatory exercises\", which became the basis of subsequent behavior therapy for assertiveness.\n\nSalter's techniques were revived among college students during the early and mid-1970s at Bernard M. Baruch College (City University of New York) by Richard Rodriguez, a student leader and newspaper Editor-in-Chief of \"The (Baruch College) Ticker\". Rodriguez was introduced to Salter's work by ex-Marine and fellow student, Brian Guerre. After corresponding with Salter, Rodriguez held training sessions on campus in the office of his \"Health Sciences Society\" organization which he founded in 1972. Over a two-year period, Rodriguez trained over two hundred students in progressive relaxation and autosuggestion, which improved the students' ability to study and perform better on exams. Mr. Rodriguez's motto was \"relax to your purpose\". Rodriguez has also advanced the theory that all human conflict is based on each individual's (or group's) unfulfilled (long-term/lifelong) expectations, which may be modified to a limited extent, through Salter's techniques of personality reconstruction.\n\nIn a 2008 phone interview, Rodriguez remarked: \"Although we now know much more about the workings and chemistry of the brain than was known 65 years ago, Salter's techniques remain extremely effective and life altering. His works remained in print for over 25 years and have been translated in over a dozen languages and his books have earned numerous accolades. Proponents of Behavior Modification, Assertiveness Training, Auto-relaxation, Progressive (Systematic) Desensitization & Psychoprophylaxis have all used principles and applications proposed, developed or applied by Salter, whether or not they acknowledge that reality.\"\n\nThe Salter family has recently promoted the re-publication of \"Conditioned Reflex Therapy\" which was Salter's most influential work.\n\nObituary: New York Times\n\nAndrew Salter, Behavior Therapist, 82, Dies\n\nBy Karen Freeman (Published: October 9, 1996)\n\nAndrew Salter, a psychologist who helped develop the theoretical underpinnings and clinical applications of behavior therapy decades before the field became popular, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said Dr. William J. Salter, his son.\n\nMr. Salter, recognized as a founder of behavior therapy, was one of the first to take the findings from experimental psychology on things like conditioned reflexes and apply those principles to solving people's problems. He rejected psychoanalysis, with its years of probing into the roots of neuroses, arguing in the 1940s that a psychologist could help people who were overly anxious, shy or depressed much more quickly by teaching them to change their behavior.\n\nDr. Gerald C. Davison, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California, wrote that Mr. Salter had been so far ahead of the behaviorist wave of the 1960s that many younger behavioral psychologists were unaware of his work.\n\nHe said Mr. Salter's ideas \"have become so widely accepted that he is often not formally cited when contemporary writers in behavior therapy refer to assertion training, expressiveness training, 'getting in touch with one's feelings,' \" all early ideas of Mr. Salter's that became popular later.\n\nDr. Davison made those comments in recommending that the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy present Mr. Salter with its lifetime achievement award, which it will do posthumously, on Nov. 23. He is the second psychologist to win the award.\n\nMr. Salter took an unconventional path to an unusual career. Born in Waterbury, Conn., he graduated from New York University in 1937 with a bachelor's degree in psychology and a burning interest in research, but no patience for postgraduate work. \"I had no desire to spend the rest of my life studying the reactions of rats lost in labyrinths,\" he once said.\n\nHe plunged into research and clinical practice, which was possible with a bachelor's degree at the time, and was allowed to continue to practice when the state later set more rigid licensing standards. He continued his practice until a few months ago.\n\nHypnosis had captured Mr. Salter's interest in college, and he looked for ways to use it in clinical practice. He developed techniques for self-hypnosis but initially found it hard to publish his work because he did not have the necessary academic credentials. A psychologist at Yale University, Dr. Clark Leonard Hull, helped him publish an article in The Journal of General Psychology in 1941. He came to national attention that year when Life magazine publicized his ideas about short-term psychotherapy. In 1944, he published his first book, \"What Is Hypnosis?\"\n\nIn 1949, Mr. Salter published \"Conditioned Reflex Therapy,\" which took many of the principles developed by those who did watch rats run mazes and used them to develop short-term therapies for neuroses. In an interview, Dr. Davison called it \"a landmark book in experimentally based psychotherapy.\"\n\nThe therapy Mr. Salter employed encouraged patients to express their emotions and used visual imagery to reduce anxiety. It also moved people past their fears by gradually getting them accustomed to being around the things they feared. [progressive or systematic desensitization]\n\nIn 1952, Mr. Salter published \"The Case Against Psychoanalysis,\" in which he looked at the scientific basis for that field and pronounced it weak. The book generated much controversy, said Dr. Alan E. Kazdin, a psychology professor at Yale, particularly because Mr. Salter used such vivid language to wield his literary club. \"One of his phrases was that trying to pin down psychoanalysis was like nailing lemon meringue to a wall,\" Dr. Kazdin said. \"But what made him special was that he didn't just criticize. He came up with an alternative, applied it and helped develop a whole movement.\"\n\nBesides his son William, of Harvard, Mass., Mr. Salter is survived by his wife, Rhoda; another son, Robert, of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Bertha Seigel of Montgomery County, Md., and three grandchildren.\n\n[Obituary Submitted by Richard Rodriguez (July 23, 2008), with gratitude, admiration and respect]\n\nIn the original Frank Sinatra film \"The Manchurian Candidate\" the Chinese cite Salter's work as their inspiration to brainwash the soldiers.\n\nConditioned Reflex Therapy was part of a list of books owned by Marilyn Monroe, auctioned at Christies-NY, October 28–29, 1999.\n"}

He was raised in Gallipolis, Ohio, a free state where he was allowed to read and write. He attended Wilberforce University and attended divinity school in Hannibal, Missouri. The American Civil War broke out while he was at Wilberforce. He later claimed that he and 115 students from the mostly black University attempted to enlist in the Union Army but were refused.\n\nCain worked as a barber in Galena, Illinois, and worked on steamboats along the Ohio River before he migrated south.\n\nHe had been licensed to preach for the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1844. His first assignment was in Hannibal, Missouri. In 1848, frustrated by the segregationist policies of the Methodists, he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an independent black denomination started in Philadelphia. By 1859 he became a deacon in Muscatine, Iowa. In 1861, Cain was called as a pastor at the Bridge Street Church in Brooklyn, New York. In 1862, he was ordained as an elder in 1862 and remained at the Brooklyn church until 1865.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Cain moved to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1865 as superintendent of AME missions and presided over the Emmanuel Church in that city. The AME Church attracted tens of thousands of converts to its denomination very rapidly.\n\nCain became active in politics, serving as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1868. He represented Charleston County in the South Carolina Senate from 1868 to 1872. He also edited the \"South Carolina Leader\" newspaper (later renamed the \"Missionary Record\"). As editor, he hired future congressmen Robert B. Elliott and Alonzo Ransier.\n\nHe was elected as a Republican to the Forty-third United States Congress in a newly created at-large district. He was on the Committee on Agriculture, but focused more on the civil rights bill which eventually passed in diluted form in 1875. He gave noted speeches on the bill in January, 1873. He did not run for re-election in 1874 after redistricting, but ran for the 2nd district in 1876. He was elected to the Forty-fifth United States Congress.\n\nIn 1877, while advocating in Congress for mail service to West African Colonies, Cain became a member of the Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company. In 1880, Cain was elected and consecrated a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church; he served the episcopal district which comprised Louisiana and Texas. He helped found Paul Quinn College and served as its president until 1884.\n\nCain then moved to Washington, D.C., where he served as AME bishop over the Mid-Atlantic and New England States. He died in Washington on January 18, 1887, and was buried in Graceland Cemetery there, but may have been removed to Woodlawn Cemetery (Washington, D.C.) about a decade later, when Graceland closed and many of its interments were reburied in Woodlawn.\n\n\n"}

Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, also known as Rajarshi Shahu was considered a true democrat and social reformer. Greatly influenced by the contributions of social reformer Jyotiba Phule, Shahu Maharaj was an able ruler who was associated with many progressive policies during his rule. From his coronation in 1894 till his demise in 1922, he worked for the cause of the lower caste subjects in his state. Primary education to all regardless of caste and creed was one of his most significant priorities.\n\nHe was born as Yeshwantrao in the Ghatge Maratha family, of Kagal village of the Kolhapur district as Yeshwantrao Ghatge to Jaisingrao and Radhabai in 26 June 1874. Jaisingrao Ghatge was the village chief, while his mother Radhabhai hailed from the royal family of Mudhol. Young Yeshwantrao lost his mother when he was only three. His education was supervised by his father till he was 10-year-old. In that year, he was adopted by Queen Anandibai, widow of King Shivaji IV, of the princely state of Kolhapur. Although the adoption rules of the time dictated that the child must have Bhosale dynasty blood in his veins, Yeshwantrao’s family background presented a unique case. He completed his formal education at the Rajkumar College, Rajkot and took lessons of administrative affairs from Sir Stuart Fraser, a representative of the Indian Civil Services. He ascended the throne in 1894 after coming of age, prior to which a regency council appointed by the British Government took care of the state affairs. During his accession Yeshwantrao was renamed as Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj. Chhatrapati Shahu was over five feet nine inches in height and displayed a regal and majestic appearance. Wrestling was one of his favourite sports and he patronised the sport throughout his rule. Wrestlers from all over the country would come to his state to participate in wrestling competitions.\n\nHe was married to Lakshmibai Khanvilkar, daughter of a nobleman from Baroda in 1891. The couple had four children – two sons and two daughters.\n\nWhen Brahmin priests of the royal family refused to perform the rites of non-Brahmins in accordance with the Vedic hymns, he took the daring step of removing the priests and appointing a young Maratha as the religious teacher of the non-Brahmins, with the title of Kshatra Jagadguru (the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This was known as the Vedokta controversy. It brought a hornet's nest about his ears, but he was not the man to retrace his steps in the face of opposition. He soon became the leader of the non-Brahmin movement and united the Marathas under his banner.\n\nChhatrapati Shahu occupied the throne of Kolhapur for 28 years, from 1894 to 1922; during this period he initiated numerous social reforms in his empire. He is credited with doing much to improve conditions for the lower castes. He also ensured suitable employment for students thus educated, thereby creating one of the earliest affirmative action (50% reservation to weaker sections) programs in history. Many of these measures came in to effect in the year 1902. He started Shahu Chhatrapati Weaving and Spinning Mill in 1906 to provide employment. Rajaram college was built by Shahu Maharaj, and later was named after him. His emphasis was on education, his aim being to make learning available to the masses. He introduced a number of educational programs to promote education among his subjects. He established hostels for different ethnicities and religions, including Panchals, Devadnya, Nabhik, Shimpi, Dhor-Chambhar communities as well as for Muslims, Jains and Christians. He established the Miss Clarke Boarding School for the socially quarantined segments of the community. Shahu introduced several scholarships for poor yet meritorious students from backward castes. He also initiated compulsory free primary education for all in his state. He established Vedic Schools which enabled students from all castes and classes to learn the scriptures, thus propagating Sanskrit education among all. He also founded special schools for village heads or ‘patils’ to make them better administrators.\n\nSahu was a strong advocate of equality among all strata of society and refused to give the Brahmins any special status. He removed Brahmins from the post of Royal Religious advisers when they refused to perform religious rites for non-Brahmins. He appointed a young Maratha scholar in the post and bestowed him the title of `Kshatra Jagadguru' (the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This incident together with Shahu’s encouragement of the non-Brahmins to read and recite the Vedas led to the Vedokta controversy in Maharashtra. This dispute brought a storm of protest from the elite strata of society and vicious opposition to his rule. He established the Deccan Rayat Association in Nipani during 1916. The association sought to secure political rights for non-Brahmins and invite their equal participation in politics. Shahu was influenced by the works of Jyotiba Phule, and long patronized the Satya Shodhak Samaj, formed by Phule. In his later life, he eventually moved towards the Arya Samaj.\n\nIn 1903, he attended the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and in May that year received the honorary degree LL.D. from the University of Cambridge.\n\nShahu made great efforts to abolish the concept of caste segregation and untouchability. He introduced (perhaps the first known) reservation system in government jobs for untouchable castes. His Royal Decree ordered his subjects to treat every member of society as equal, and granting the untouchables equal access to public utilities like wells and ponds, as well as establishments like schools and hospitals. He legalised inter-caste marriage and made great efforts to improve the situation of the dalits. He discontinued the hereditary transfer of titles and tenures of revenue collectors (Kulkarni), a caste infamous for exploiting the masses, having enslaved the Mahars, a lower caste.\n\nHe also worked towards betterment of the condition of women in his empire. He established schools to educate women, and also spoke vociferously on the topic of women's education. He legalised widow remarriage in 1917 and made efforts towards stopping child marriage. In 1920, Shahu introduced a law banning the devadasi Pratha, the practice of offering girls to God, which essentially led to sexual exploitation of girls at the hands of the clergy.\n\nShahu introduced a number of projects which enabled his subjects to sustain themselves in their chosen professions. The Shahu Chhatrapati Spinning and Weaving Mill, dedicated marketplaces and co-operative societies for farmers were established to free his subjects from predacious middlemen in trading. He made credits available to farmers looking to buy equipment to modernise agricultural practices, and even established the King Edward Agricultural Institute to instruct farmers in increasing crop yield and related techniques. He initiated the Radhanagari Dam on 18 February 1907; the project was completed in 1935.and made Kolhapur self-sufficient in water.\n\nHe was a great patron of art and culture, encouraging music and the fine arts. He supported writers and researchers in their endeavours. He installed gymnasiums and wrestling pitches and highlighted the importance of health consciousness among the youth.\n\nHis seminal contribution in social, political, educational, agricultural and cultural spheres earned him the title of Rajarshi, which was bestowed upon him by the Kurmi warrior community of Kanpur.\nChhatrapati was introduced to Dr. Ambedkar by artists Dattoba Pawar and Dittoba Dalvi. The Maharaja was greatly impressed by the great intellect of young Bhimrao and his revolutionary ideas regarding untouchability. The two met a number of times during 1917-1921 and went over possible ways to abolish the negatives of caste segregation by providing \"caste-based reservation\" to selected people. They organised a conference for the betterment of the untouchables (thereby validating the unfortunate definition of untouchability) during 21–22 March 1920 and the Chhatrapati made Ambedkar the Chairman as he believed that Ambedkar was the leader who would work for the amelioration of the segregated segments of the society. He even donated Rs. 2,500 to Ambedkar, when the latter started his newspaper ‘Mooknayak’ on 31 January 1921, and contributed more later for the same cause. Their association lasted till the Chhatrapati’s death in 1922.\n\nIn 1891, Shahu married Lakshmibai née Khanvilkar (1880–1945), daughter of a Maratha nobleman from Baroda. They were the parents of four children:\n\n\nChhatrapati Shahu died on 6 May 1922 in Bombay. He was succeeded by his eldest son Rajaram III as the Maharaja of Kolhapur. The reforms initiated by Chhatrapati Shahu gradually began to fade for the lack of able leadership to carry on the legacy.\n\nHis full official name was: Colonel His Highness Kshatriya-Kulaawatans Sinhasanaadheeshwar, Shreemant Rajarshi Sir Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj Sahib Bahadur, GCSI, GCIE, GCVO.\n\nDuring his life he acquired the following titles and honorific names:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Additional applications can be included in the image using plugins. \n\nAs it often resides on a Live CD or USB drive, BartPE allows a user to boot Windows, even if a hardware or software fault has disabled the installed operating system(s) on the internal hard drive – for instance, to recover files. It can also be used to scan for and remove rootkits, computer viruses and spyware (that have infected boot files), or to reset a lost administrator password.\n\nPE Builder (also known as Bart PE Builder) is the software used to create the BartPE system images.\n\nAs with Windows Preinstallation Environment, BartPE operates by loading system registry files into RAM, and not writing any registry changes back to boot media. Thus, both operating systems require no hard drive or network access. This also allows them to be run from non-writable media such as a CD-ROM.\n\nSince each instance of BartPE is a new installation, the BartPE \"boot\" disk needs original Windows setup files in order to operate.

Northern populations are migratory, wintering on the Caribbean coast of Central America and northern South America. Several vagrant populations are known to exist in the American Northeast.\n\nThis tyrant flycatcher is found in tall trees and shrubs, including the edges of savanna and marshes. It makes a flimsy cup nest in a tree. The female incubates the typical clutch of two cream eggs, which are marked with reddish brown.\n\nThe adult gray kingbird is an average-sized kingbird. It measures in length and weighs from . The upperparts are gray, with brownish wings and tail, and the underparts are white with a gray tinge to the chest.

The couple divorced when Rich was five years old. He is one of seven children and has 3 brothers and 3 sisters including one biological brother, Greg and five half-siblings.\n\nPrior to becoming a full-time MMA fighter, Franklin graduated from William Henry Harrison High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and later earned a master's degree in education at the University of Cincinnati, and taught mathematics at the Oak Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nHis nickname \"Ace\" comes from his resemblance to the actor Jim Carrey, who played the character Ace Ventura. Joe Rogan once called him \"Angry Jim Carrey\".\n\nFranklin is a born-again Christian and quotes Psalm 144:1 on his webpage and fighter gear. February 21, 2006, was officially named \"Rich Franklin Day\" in Cincinnati by the city's mayor.\n\nAmerican Fighter\n\nIn 2002, Franklin and his business partner Jeff Adler created American Fighter athletic clothing brand. Initially the brand featured T-shirts, but quickly grew into an athletic apparel brand featuring a full line of athletic training clothing, casual wear and training gear for martial arts. In 2012 Affliction Clothing expressed interest in the name and its widespread appeal.

Franklin broke his left hand early on in the second round. The injury required surgery, including a metal plate and screws, and Franklin was out of action for six months.\n\nAt UFC 64 on October 14, 2006, Franklin lost his title on his return fight after being defeated by Anderson Silva. The fight was stopped by TKO (knees) at 2:49 of the first round after Franklin received a knee to the face. Franklin, who was considered by many to be the favourite coming into the bout, was caught in a clinch by the Brazilian, with Silva delivering a flurry of knees and kicks that rendered the champion unable to continue. On October 19, Franklin underwent surgery due to the nasal fracture he received during the fight.\n\nFranklin made his return at UFC 68 against Jason MacDonald. Franklin showed superior striking during the fight, and mounted MacDonald in the closing seconds of the second round, causing significant injury and swelling around MacDonald's left eye. MacDonald's corner advised ending the fight and Franklin was declared the winner by TKO (corner stoppage) between rounds. After the fight Franklin called Anderson Silva to the Octagon and said that he and Dana White had agreed to a fight for the title in Franklin's hometown of Cincinnati.\n\nIn a bout that would determine the top contender in the middleweight division, Franklin fought world ranked Yushin Okami at UFC 72 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Franklin defeated the top middleweight contender by unanimous decision to be officially announced as the number one contender for Silva's middleweight championship. The bout was only Franklin's second overall fight that went the full distance (due to being a non-title fight, it was three rounds). All three judges scored the bout 29–28 to Franklin. Franklin also became the first person to main event a UFC card in Northern Ireland.\n\nFranklin fought Silva for a second time at UFC 77 on October 20, 2007. Prior to the bout, he had recently signed a new six-fight contract with the UFC. Much like their first fight, Silva was able to effectively neutralize Franklin in the clinch, eventually defeating the former champion via TKO (knees) at 1:07 in the second round.\n\nAfter Rich's second loss to Anderson, he began making regular trips to Seattle, WA to train with Matt Hume of AMC Pankration to prepare for UFC 83, where Franklin faced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt Travis Lutter. During the bout Lutter was able to secure a tight high-level armbar, though Franklin was able to escape the hold and go on to win the bout via TKO (strikes) at 3:01 of round 2.\n\nAt UFC 88, Franklin made his return to the light heavyweight division against close friend and training partner Matt Hamill. Franklin won by TKO following a kick to the liver which prompted the referee to call a stop to the fight at 0:39 in round 3.\n\nFranklin met with former Pride Welterweight Champion and former Pride Middleweight Champion Dan Henderson at UFC 93 in Dublin, Ireland. In a closely contested fight, Franklin ultimately lost by controversial split decision. The winner would gain the opportunity to coach Team USA on Season 9 of The Ultimate Fighter. Franklin became the first person to main event a UFC show in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAt UFC 99 in Cologne, Germany, Franklin defeated former Pride Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva via unanimous decision at a catchweight of 195 lbs. Franklin became the first person in UFC history to fight in four different countries, in four consecutive fights.\n\nAt UFC 103 another catchweight contest, Rich lost to former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Vitor Belfort. This was Belfort's first bout in the UFC since February 2005. After a lengthy feeling-out process, Belfort connected with a left hook that dropped Franklin, following up with a flurry of left hands that ended the contest via TKO at 3:02 in the first round. Though it was logged as a clear win for Belfort, there was discussion over the multiple illegal blows to the back of Franklin's head.\nFranklin was rumoured to face multiple-time UFC Champion Randy Couture at UFC 115. After contrasting reports on who would be his opponent, Franklin eventually was confirmed to face former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Chuck Liddell on June 12, 2010, following the withdrawal of Liddell's original opponent, Tito Ortiz. During the contest, Liddell showed improved striking from that seen in his recent fights, showing more proficient kicks. In the final seconds the opening round, Liddell connected with a head kick and moved forward to attack an arguably stunned Franklin, only to be knocked out by a compact counter right hand at 4:55 of round 1. During the post-fight press conference, Franklin confirmed that his left forearm had been broken by a head kick Liddell threw during the middle of the round. Fortunately, however, the forearm would not need surgery, allowing Franklin to recover faster.\n\nFranklin faced former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Forrest Griffin on February 5, 2011 at UFC 126. He lost the fight via unanimous decision.\n\nFranklin was scheduled to face Antonio Rogerio Nogueira at UFC 133 on August 6, 2011 in Philadelphia. Nogueira was forced out of the bout due to a shoulder injury. Unable to find a suitable replacement on short notice, the UFC pulled Franklin from the card as well.\n\nFranklin faced Wanderlei Silva in a rematch, replacing Vitor Belfort who suffered a hand injury. In the main event at a 190 lbs catchweight on June 23, 2012 at UFC 147. He won the fight via unanimous decision, with both participants earning \"Fight of the Night\" honors for their performances.\n\nFranklin returned to the middleweight division against former Strikeforce middleweight champion Cung Le on November 10, 2012 in the main event at UFC on Fuel TV 6. He lost the fight via KO in the first round.\n\nAfter teasing the possibility of one more MMA fight before calling it quits, Franklin instead announced his retirement on September 28, 2015. Franklin penned a retirement column on theplayerstribune.com in which he indicated that a recent conversation with his mother helped make the decision and the understanding that “his body has slowed down.”\n\nOn April 13th 2019, on the broadcast of UFC 236 it was revealed that Franklin would be introduced into the UFC Hall of Fame.\n\nFranklin made his acting debut in a film called \"Cyborg Soldier\" where he plays an escaped super soldier and partners with Tiffani Thiessen. In 2010 he starred in \"The Hammer\", a story inspired by the life of deaf UFC fighter Matt Hamill. He can be seen playing MMA Coach Billings in the 2014 comedy \"Mantervention\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160405", "title": "Coat of arms of Montreal", "text": "Coat of arms of Montreal\n\nThe first coat of arms of Montreal was designed by Jacques Viger, the first mayor of Montreal, and adopted in 1833 by the city councillors. Modifications were made some one hundred five years later and adopted on 21 March 1938, and again on 13 September 2017, resulting in the version currently in use. The coat of arms was the only city emblem representing Montreal until 1981, when a stylized logo was developed for common daily use, reserving the coat of arms for ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe first coat of arms was displayed on a white shield, which had a red saltire with four different charges between the arms, representative of the four main components of the population as viewed by Mayor Jacques Viger and the city council in 1833, when the arms were designed and adopted. To the top, a rose was for the English heritage of the population, the dexter a thistle for the Scots, the sinister a sprig of clover for the Irish heritage of the city, and to the bottom base a beaver for the French that originally settled the territory and traded in furs.\n\nThe blazon of the shield in the first coat of arms was as follows: \"Argent, a saltire gules between in chief a rose of the last leaved and slipped, in base a beaver to the dexter with a branch, and in fess a thistle leaved and slipped and a sprig of shamrock proper\". The motto on the scroll below the shield is \"Concordia Salus\", a Latin phrase translated as \"salvation through harmony\" or in French as \"\"le salut par la concorde\"\".\n\nIn 1938, the city council requested that the arms be updated to better reflect Montreal's population. The changes replaced the saltire with a cross, which is reminiscent of both the St. George's Cross often associated with England, and also with Christian missionary missions that could represent the principles of the French Catholics that founded the city. The beaver had become a general symbol of Montreal and its industriousness by this time period, and no longer merely represented the original French settlers, thus it was moved to ensign the shield. In place of the beaver on the shield, a blue fleur de lys was added to symbolize the descendants of the original French settlers. The rose, thistle and clover remained. The shield was surrounded by a wreath of sugar maple leaves to symbolize the amicable relations between the various elements of Montreal's population and an allusion to the maple as a national emblem of Canada. The Latin motto was retained.\n\nIn 2017, the city council decided to add a symbol representing the Indigenous Peoples, a white pine in a circle on the middle of the cross.\n\nThe Canadian Heraldic Authority granted the current version of the coat of arms in September 2017. The blazon of the arms is as follows:\n\nThe five flora designs found upon the shield are traditional national symbols in their own right, with each one alluding to a specific historical device used by a state or nation.\n\nThe fleur de lys was long used by the French Royal Houses, such as the House of Bourbon, in their coat of arms and was found upon the national flag of the French during the time Montreal was founded, and was also used as a mark of honour or favour by the King of France. The first European settlers in possession of the Island of Montreal hailed from France, and thus are represented by this symbol.\n\nThe Red Rose of Lancaster was used as a symbol of the English Royal House of Lancaster, and has become a symbol of the English people as well.\n\nTraditionally known as a trefoil, the shamrock was a symbol to early Irish Christians of the trinity. It has endured to become a symbol of the Irish people.\n\nFound in various folklore of the Scots since Roman times, the thistle has also been long used in the compartment of the Scottish royal coat of arms, and has been symbolic of the Scottish people long before heraldry.\n\nThe white pine symbolizes the Indigenous Peoples and stands for Peace and Harmony. It also represents the Circle of Life and the council fire — a place for meeting and dialogue for the First Nations .\n\nIn 1981, with an attempt to modernize the city's use of such emblems, Montreal introduced a logo for common municipal use, while the coat of arms would be reserved for the most formal of ceremonies and events. The device consists of the city's name with accent mark as found with the French spelling and a stylized rosette that is itself composed of four hearts. Officially, the type is to be in black and the rosette in red, but a few variations exist for printing purposes when the set colours would not contrast well on documents.\nGreater Montreal attempted to unify the City of Montreal with the other eighty-one surrounding municipalities under one logo in 2006. The logo that was introduced consisted of a stylized 'M' meant to look, as the design firm put it, \"deliberately chubby, very welcoming, like a comfy chair.\" However, the logo received much negative criticism for its \"patchwork of hot pink, tangerine, rhubarb, turquoise and green apple\", that was viewed as childish in implement and likened to clown paint, Smarties, jelly beans, garbage and even vomit. Public sentiment grew increasingly negative when it was discovered the cost of the ill-received design was $1,487,000 paid out from the public fund. Montreal itself continues to use the 1981 logo, and even Greater Montreal has since dropped the design they themselves introduced.\n\n\n"}

Rapier\n\nJames Thomas Rapier (November 13, 1837 – May 31, 1883) was an African-American politician from Alabama during the Reconstruction Era. He served as a United States Representative from Alabama, for one term from 1873 until 1875. Born free in Alabama, he received his higher education and law degree in Scotland and Canada before being admitted to the bar in Tennessee.\n\nRapier was a nationally prominent figure in the Republican Party as one of seven blacks serving in the 43rd Congress. He worked in 1874 for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which guaranteed equal access to public accommodations.\n\nJames T. Rapier was born free in 1837 in Florence, Alabama to John H. Rapier, a prosperous local barber, and his wife, who were established free people of color. He had three older brothers. His father had been emancipated in 1829; his mother was born into a free black family of Baltimore, Maryland. She died in 1841 when Rapier was four years old. In 1842 James and his brother John Jr. went to Nashville, Tennessee to live with their paternal grandmother Sally Thomas. There they attended a school for African-American children, and learned to read and write.\n\nIn 1856 Rapier traveled to Canada with his uncle Henry Thomas, his father's half-brother, who settled in Buxton, Ontario, an all-black community made up chiefly of African Americans. It was developed with the aid of Rev. William King, a Scots-American Presbyterian missionary. King had bought land (with Canadian government approval) for resettlement of black American refugees who had escaped to Canada during the slavery years via the Underground Railroad. The African Americans were building a thriving community, and Rapier's uncle had property there. Rapier attended the Buxton Mission School, which was highly respected and had a classical education.\n\nHe pursued higher education in three stages, first earning a teaching degree in 1856 at a normal school in Toronto. He traveled to Scotland to study at University of Glasgow. Returning to Canada, he completed his law degree at Montreal College and was admitted to the bar.\n\nAfter teaching for a time at the Buxton Mission School, Rapier moved in 1864 to Nashville, Tennessee. He attended Franklin College, a historically black college, to gain a teaching certificate.\n\nWorking as a reporter for a northern newspaper, Rapier bought 200 acres in Maury County, Tennessee, and became a cotton planter. He made a keynote speech at the Tennessee Negro Suffrage Convention.\n\nHe continued as an advocate for black voting rights but was disappointed in the return of Confederates to state office. With his father needing help, Rapier returned to his home in Alabama in 1866. There he bought 550 acres and again cultivated cotton. He became active in the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to the 1867 state constitutional convention.\n\nIn 1870 Rapier ran for Alabama Secretary of State and lost. In 1872 he was elected to the Forty-third United States Congress from Alabama's 2nd congressional district, one of three African-American congressmen elected from the state during Reconstruction. While in Congress, he had national scope. Rapier proposed authorizing a land bureau to allocate Western lands to freedmen. He also proposed that Congress appropriate $5 million to devote to public education in Southern schools.\n\nHe was one of seven black Congressmen at the time; in 1874 they each testified for the Civil Rights Act, which was signed in 1875. Rapier recalled being denied service at every inn at stopping points between Montgomery, Alabama, and Washington, DC, despite being a US Congressman. He noted how the race issue in the United States society related to what were often class and religious inequalities in other lands, and said that he was \"half slave and half free\", having political rights but no civil rights. He said that in Europe, \"they have princes, dukes, and lords; in India, \"brahmans or priests, who rank above the sudras or laborers;\" in America, \"our distinction is color.\"\n\nAfter losing his re-election campaign in 1874, Rapier was appointed by the Republican presidential administration as a collector for the Internal Revenue Service in Alabama, serving in this role until his death. He campaigned against the conservative Democratic Party's Redeemer government in Alabama, but Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1874. After passing other restrictive laws that created Jim Crow rules, in 1901 white Democrats passed a new state constitution that required poll taxes and literacy tests for persons trying to register to vote. Under subjective white administration, these barriers essentially disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites in Alabama, excluding them from the political system for decades into the late 20th century.\n\nRapier died in Montgomery, Alabama on May 31, 1883 of pulmonary tuberculosis. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. The Rapier Family Papers are held by Howard University.\n\nIn 1979 historian John Hope Franklin gave a presidential address to the American Historical Association. He discussed how Walter L. Fleming of Vanderbilt University, one of the most prominent of the influential historians of the 20th-century Dunning School, had written about Rapier. Franklin observed that Fleming's viewpoint, which had been hostile to civil and voting rights for African Americans, may have led him to make errors.\n\nFranklin said:\n\nFranklin explained:\n\nFranklin said: \"In 1905 Fleming made Rapier a Canadian because it suited his purposes to have a bold, aggressive, 'impertinent' Negro in Alabama Reconstruction come from some non-Southern, contaminating environment like Canada. But it did not suit his purposes to call Yancey, who was a graduate of Williams College, a 'Massachusetts Man.' Fleming described Yancey (a white Confederate) as, simply, the 'leader of the States Rights men.'\" [Fleming, \"Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama\", p. 12.] For a detailed account and comparison of Yancey and other white Southerners who went North to secure an education, see Franklin's book, \"A Southern Odyssey: Travelers in the Antebellum North\" (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1976), pp. 45–80. \nFranklin is critical of Fleming for falsely stating that Rapier, and others, were \"carpetbaggers.\"\nFranklin said, \"...some of the people that Fleming called carpetbaggers had lived in Alabama for years and were, therefore, entitled to at least as much presumption of assimilation in moving from some other state to Alabama decades before the war as the Irish were in moving from their native land to some community in the United States. ...Whether they had lived in Alabama for decades before the Civil War or had settled there after the war, these \"carpetbaggers\" were apparently not to be regarded as models for Northern investors or settlers in the early years of the twentieth century. Twentieth-century investors from the North were welcome provided they accepted the established arrangements in race relations and the like. Fleming served his Alabama friends well by ridiculing carpetbaggers, even if in the process he had to distort and misrepresent.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2160429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160429", "title": "Dynamical billiards", "text": "Dynamical billiards\n\nA dynamical billiard is a dynamical system in which a particle alternates between free motion (typically as a straight line) and specular reflections from a boundary. When the particle hits the boundary it reflects from it without loss of speed (i.e. elastic collisions). Billiards are Hamiltonian idealizations of the game of billiards, but where the region contained by the boundary can have shapes other than rectangular and even be multidimensional. Dynamical billiards may also be studied on non-Euclidean geometries; indeed, the very first studies of billiards established their ergodic motion on surfaces of constant negative curvature. The study of billiards which are kept out of a region, rather than being kept in a region, is known as outer billiard theory.\n\nThe motion of the particle in the billiard is a straight line, with constant energy, between reflections with the boundary (a geodesic if the Riemannian metric of the billiard table is not flat). All reflections are specular: the angle of incidence just before the collision is equal to the angle of reflection just after the collision. The sequence of reflections is described by the billiard map that completely characterizes the motion of the particle.\n\nBilliards capture all the complexity of Hamiltonian systems, from integrability to chaotic motion, without the difficulties of integrating the equations of motion to determine its Poincaré map. Birkhoff showed that a billiard system with an elliptic table is integrable.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a particle of mass \"m\" moving freely without friction on a surface is:\n\nwhere formula_2 is a potential designed to be zero inside the region formula_3 in which the particle can move, and infinity otherwise:\n\nThis form of the potential guarantees a specular reflection on the boundary. The kinetic term guarantees that the particle moves in a straight line, without any change in energy. If the particle is to move on a non-Euclidean manifold, then the Hamiltonian is replaced by:\n\nwhere formula_6 is the metric tensor at point formula_7. Because of the very simple structure of this Hamiltonian, the equations of motion for the particle, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations, are nothing other than the geodesic equations on the manifold: the particle moves along geodesics.\n\nHadamard's billiards concern the motion of a free point particle on a surface of constant negative curvature, in particular, the simplest compact Riemann surface with negative curvature, a surface of genus 2 (a two-holed donut). The model is exactly solvable, and is given by the geodesic flow on the surface. It is the earliest example of deterministic chaos ever studied, having been introduced by Jacques Hadamard in 1898.\n\nArtin's billiard considers the free motion of a point particle on a surface of constant negative curvature, in particular, the simplest non-compact Riemann surface, a surface with one cusp. It is notable for being exactly solvable, and yet not only ergodic but also strongly mixing. It is an example of an Anosov system. This system was first studied by Emil Artin in 1924.\n\nLet \"M\" be complete smooth Riemannian manifold without boundary, maximal sectional curvature of which is not greater than \"K\" and with the injectivity radius formula_8. Consider a collection of \"n\" geodesically convex subsets (walls) formula_9, formula_10, such that their boundaries are smooth submanifolds of codimension one. Let \nformula_11, where formula_12 denotes the interior of the set formula_13. The set formula_14 will be called the billiard table.\nConsider now a particle that moves inside the set \"B\" with unit speed along a geodesic until\nit reaches one of the sets \"B\" (such an event is called a collision) where it reflects according to the law “the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection” (if it reaches one of the sets formula_15 , formula_16, the trajectory is not defined after that moment). Such dynamical system is called semi-dispersing billiard. If the walls are strictly convex, then the billiard is called dispersing. The naming is motivated by observation that a locally parallel beam of trajectories disperse after a collision with strictly convex part of a wall, but remain locally parallel after a collision with a flat section of a wall.\n\nDispersing boundary plays the same role for billiards as negative curvature does for geodesic flows causing the exponential instability of the dynamics. It is precisely this dispersing mechanism that gives dispersing billiards their strongest chaotic properties, as it was established by Yakov G. Sinai. Namely, the billiards are ergodic, mixing, Bernoulli, having a positive Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and an exponential decay of correlations.\n\nChaotic properties of general semi-dispersing billiards are not understood that well, however, those of one important type of semi-dispersing billiards, hard ball gas were studied in some details since 1975 (see next section).\n\nGeneral results of Dmitry Burago and Serge Ferleger on the uniform estimation on the number of collisions in non-degenerate semi-dispersing billiards allow to establish finiteness of its topological entropy and no more than exponential growth of periodic trajectories. In contrast, \"degenerate\" semi-dispersing billiards may have infinite topological entropy.\n\nThe table of the Lorentz gas (also known as Sinai billiard) is a square with a disk removed from its center; the table is flat, having no curvature. The billiard arises from studying the behavior of two interacting disks bouncing inside a square, reflecting off the boundaries of the square and off each other. By eliminating the center of mass as a configuration variable, the dynamics of two interacting disks reduces to the dynamics in the Sinai billiard.\n\nThe billiard was introduced by Yakov G. Sinai as an example of an interacting Hamiltonian system that displays physical thermodynamic properties: almost all (up to a measure zero) of its possible trajectories are ergodic and it has a positive Lyapunov exponent.\n\nSinai's great achievement with this model was to show that the classical Boltzmann–Gibbs ensemble for an ideal gas is essentially the maximally chaotic Hadamard billiards.\n\nThe table called the Bunimovich stadium is a rectangle capped by semicircles, a shape called a stadium. Until it was introduced by Leonid Bunimovich, billiards with positive Lyapunov exponents were thought to need convex scatters, such as the disk in the Sinai billiard, to produce the exponential divergence of orbits. Bunimovich showed that by considering the orbits beyond the focusing point of a concave region it was possible to obtain exponential divergence.\n\nMagnetic billiards represent billiards where a \"charged\" particle is propagating under the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. As a result, the particle trajectory changes from a straight line into an arc of a circle. The radius of this circle is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength. Such billiards have been useful in real world applications of billiards, typically modelling nanodevices (see Applications).\n\nGeneralized billiards (GB) describe a motion of a mass point (a particle) inside a closed domain formula_17 with the piece-wise smooth boundary formula_18. On the boundary formula_18 the velocity of point is transformed as the particle underwent the action of generalized billiard law. GB were introduced by Lev D. Pustyl'nikov in the general case, and, in the case when formula_20 is a parallelepiped in connection with the justification of the second law of thermodynamics. From the physical point of view, GB describe a gas consisting of finitely many particles moving in a vessel, while the walls of the vessel heat up or cool down. The essence of the generalization is the following. As the particle hits the boundary formula_18, its velocity transforms with the help of a given function formula_22, defined on the direct product formula_23 (where formula_24 is the real line, formula_25 is a point of the boundary and formula_26 is time), according to the following law. Suppose that the trajectory of the particle, which moves with the velocity formula_27, intersects formula_18 at the point formula_25 at time formula_30. Then at time formula_30 the particle acquires the velocity formula_32, as if it underwent an elastic push from the infinitely-heavy plane formula_33, which is tangent to formula_18 at the point formula_35, and at time formula_30 moves along the normal to formula_18 at formula_35 with the velocity formula_39. We emphasize that the \"position\" of the boundary itself is fixed, while its action upon the particle is defined through the function formula_40.\n\nWe take the positive direction of motion of the plane formula_33 to be towards the \"interior\" of formula_20. Thus if the derivative formula_43, then the particle accelerates after the impact.\n\nIf the velocity formula_32, acquired by the particle as the result of the above reflection law, is directed to the interior of the domain formula_20, then the particle will leave the boundary and continue moving in formula_20 until the next collision with formula_18. If the velocity formula_32 is directed towards the outside of formula_20, then the particle remains on formula_18 at the point formula_35 until at some time formula_52 the interaction with the boundary will force the particle to leave it.\n\nIf the function formula_22 does not depend on time formula_54; i.e., formula_55, the generalized billiard coincides with the classical one.\n\nThis generalized reflection law is very natural. First, it reflects an obvious fact that the walls of the vessel with gas are motionless. Second the action of the wall on the particle is still the classical elastic push. In the essence, we consider infinitesimally moving boundaries with given velocities.\n\nIt is considered the reflection from the boundary formula_18 both in the framework of classical mechanics (Newtonian case) and the theory of relativity (relativistic case).\n\nMain results: in the Newtonian case the energy of particle is bounded, the Gibbs entropy is a constant, (in Notes) and in relativistic case the energy of particle, the Gibbs entropy, the entropy with respect to the phase volume grow to infinity, (in Notes), references to generalized billiards.\n\nThe quantum version of the billiards is readily studied in several ways. The classical Hamiltonian for the billiards, given above, is replaced by the stationary-state Schrödinger equation formula_57 or, more precisely,\n\nwhere formula_59 is the Laplacian. The potential that is infinite outside the region formula_3 but zero inside it translates to the Dirichlet boundary conditions:\n\nAs usual, the wavefunctions are taken to be orthonormal:\n\nCuriously, the free-field Schrödinger equation is the same as the Helmholtz equation,\n\nwith\n\nThis implies that two and three-dimensional quantum billiards can be modelled by the classical resonance modes of a radar cavity of a given shape, thus opening a door to experimental verification. (The study of radar cavity modes must be limited to the transverse magnetic (TM) modes, as these are the ones obeying the Dirichlet boundary conditions).\n\nThe semi-classical limit corresponds to formula_65 which can be seen to be equivalent to formula_66, the mass increasing so that it behaves classically.\n\nAs a general statement, one may say that whenever the classical equations of motion are integrable (e.g. rectangular or circular billiard tables), then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely solvable. When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly solvable, and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos.\n\nA particularly striking example of scarring on an elliptical table is given by the observation of the so-called quantum mirage.\n\nBilliards, both quantum and classical, have been applied in several areas of physics to model quite diverse real world systems. Examples include ray-optics, lasers, acoustics, optical fibers (e.g. double-clad fibers ), or quantum-classical correspondence. One of their most frequent application is to model particles moving inside nanodevices, for example quantum dots, pn-junctions, antidot superlattices, among others. The reason for this broadly spread effectiveness of billiards as physical models resides on the fact that in situations with small amount of disorder or noise, the movement of e.g. particles like electrons, or light rays, is very much similar to the movement of the point-particles in billiards.In addition, the energy conserving nature of the particle collisions is a direct reflection of the energy conservation of Hamiltonian mechanics.\n\nOpen source software to simulate billiards exist for various programming languages. From most recent to oldest, existing software are: DynamicalBilliards.jl (Julia), Bill2D (C++) and Billiard Simulator (Matlab).

Lead singer Michael's vocals were now showing the signs of his maturing tenor voice, while Jermaine's voice had become much deeper in tone. Notably, one of \"Skywriter's\" songs, \"Touch\" (originally recorded by the Supremes in 1971), features Michael and Jermaine singing about satisfying a woman in bed. Due to the fact that Michael was only 14 years old at the time, \"Touch\" was one of the most controversial singles Michael had sung on until his solo career took off again in the late 1970s.\n\nMichael, at this point, was frustrated with the direction he and his brothers were going in and complained to Motown's staff producers and writers about the kind of music they were doing. The brothers were openly discouraged by the style of music they had been receiving from Motown's writers. Also, by this point, all five brothers were writing their own material, but Motown prevented them from recording their own compositions. The frustration was showcased most openly by the album cover, where all five brothers solemnly look at the camera around an early 1900s era airplane. It was the band's least successful album to date because of only one Top 20 single and a lack of promotion because the boys were on tour at this time. The album sold 2.8 million copies worldwide.

The musical starred Bert Lahr, Ethel Merman and Betty Grable, and the song \"Friendship\" was one of the highlights. The musical was made into a 1943 Technicolor film \"Du Barry Was a Lady\", starring Red Skelton, Lucille Ball, Gene Kelly and Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra.\n\nA washroom attendant, Louis Blore, has won a sweepstakes, and subsequently quits his job. He is in love with the nightclub singer May Daly, but she is in love with Alex Barton. Alex is the brother of her friend Alice, who is in love with Harry Norton. Meanwhile, Alex is unhappily married to Ann. Charley, Louis's replacement, suggests that Louis slip Alex a Mickey Finn. While trying to do so, Louis inadvertently drinks the Mickey Finn, falls asleep, and dreams he is King Louis XV of France, and that May is Madame du Barry.\n\nIn his dream, Charley becomes the Dauphin (later Louis XVI) and Harry becomes the captain of the guard, with Ann as Du Barry's lady-in-waiting, and Alex as a peasant who wrote a rude song about The King and Du Barry (the title song: \"Du Barry Was a Lady\"). Eventually after various entanglements (including the Dauphin's shooting the King in the posterior with a bow and arrow), Louis wakes up and realises that Alex is the man for May. He uses the last of his winnings to pay for Alex's divorce from Ann, and (with Charley having just quit his job) goes back to being a washroom attendant.\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre on December 6, 1939, transferred to the Royale Theatre on October 21, 1940 and closed December 12, 1940, after 408 performances. It was directed by Edgar MacGregor, choreographed by Robert Alton, with the orchestrations of Robert Russell Bennett and Ted Royal. The cast featured Bert Lahr as Louis Blore, Ethel Merman as May Daly, Betty Grable as Alice Barton, Benny Baker as Charley, Ronald Graham as Alex Barton and Charles Walters as Harry Norton. Gypsy Rose Lee and Frances Williams later played the part of May Daly.\n\nThe show opened in the West End at Her Majesty's Theatre on 22 October 1942 and ran for 178 performances. It was directed by Richard Bird. The cast featured Arthur Riscoe as Louis Blore, Frances Day as May Daly, Frances Marsden as Alice Barton, Jacky Hunter as Charley, Bruce Trent as Alex Barton and Teddy Beaumont as Harry Norton.\n\nThe show has been produced in concert form several times in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The two London productions, in 1993 and 2001, were by the Discovering Lost Musicals Charitable Trust and featured Louise Gold as May Daly with Barry Cryer as Louis in 1993 and Desmond Barrit in 2001. The May 1993 production was at the Barbican Centre. The November 2001 concert was (like the original London production) at Her Majesty's Theatre, recorded for radio by the BBC (it was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 during Christmas 2002).\n\nNew York City Center Encores! presented a staged concert in February 1996 with Robert Morse (Louis) and Faith Prince (May). New York's Musicals Tonight! presented a production March–April, 2017.\n\nThe song \"Give Him the Ooh-La-La\" was performed by Carol Burnett in one of her earlier TV appearances in 1956 as part of the Omnibus program \"The American Musical Comedy\".\n\nThe show later appeared on the BBC Radio with Louise Gold and Desmond Barrit singing the lead roles.\n\n\"Du Barry Was a Lady\" received a fully staged production in May 2014 by San Francisco's 42nd Street Moon Company starring Bruce Vilanch in the Bert Lahr role, directed and choreographed by Zack Thomas Wilde.\n\nIn an early shared credit, the songwriting duo of Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane handled the vocal arrangements for the original Broadway production.\n\n\nBrooks Atkinson wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"Although Miss Merman is jaunty and Mr. Lahr is funny, they have a hard time keeping this show merry. The authors have struck a dead level of Broadway obscenity that does not yield much mirth. As the music-maker Mr. Porter has written a number of accomplished tunes in the modern idiom and one excellent romantic song, \"Do I Love You?\" but the lyrics are no more inspired than the book; they treat all humor as middling. The performers supply more pleasure than the authors and composer. Betty Grable and Charles Walters, who would also be featured in a free society, dance and sing with remarkable dash.\"\n\n\"Life\" praised the performers, especially Betty Grable \"who can dance and sing like a May breeze\" and Merman and Lahr \"two musical comedy veterans...in top form.\"\n\nThe film was released by MGM on May 30, 1943.

Originally performed and maintained by attendants of the royal palaces, Khmer classical dance was introduced to the general public in the mid-20th century and became widely celebrated as iconic of Cambodian culture, often performed during public events, holidays, and for tourists visiting Cambodia. Performances feature elaborately costumed dancers performing slow and figurative gestures to the musical accompaniment of a pinpeat ensemble. The classical repertoire includes dances of tribute or invocation and the enactment of traditional stories and epic poems such as the \"Ramayana\". Two of the most performed classical dances are the \"Robam Chuon Por\" (\"Wishing dance\") and the \"Robam Tep Apsara\" (\"Apsara dance\").\n\nOther names for Khmer classical dance include \"Cambodian court dance\" and \"the royal ballet of Cambodia\", although the latter term can also refer to the National Dance Company of Cambodia. In Khmer, it is formally known as \"Robam Preah Reach Trop\" (, lit. \"dances of royal wealth\") or \"Lakhon Preah Reach Trop\" (, lit. \"theatre of royal wealth\"). It is also sometimes called \"Lakhon Luong\" (, lit. \"the king's theatre\"). During the Lon Nol regime of Cambodia, the dance tradition was referred to as \"Lakhon Kbach Boran Khmer\" (, lit. \"Khmer theatre of the ancient style\"), a term that distanced it from its royal legacy.\n\nCreated in the 20th century are folk dances that emphasize that various cultural traditions and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Cambodian folk dances are usually more fast-paced than classical dances. The movements and gestures are not as stylized as classical dance. Folk dancers wear clothes of the people they are portraying such as Chams, hill tribes, farmers, and peasants. Some folk dances are about love or folktales. Most of the music of folk dances is played by a mahori orchestra.\n\n\nSocial dances commonly danced at social gatherings in Cambodia include the \"romvong\", \"rom kbach\", \"saravann\", \"chok krapeus\" and \"lam leav\". Other social dances from around the world have influenced Cambodian social culture, including the cha-cha, the bolero, and the Madison. Such dances are often performed at Cambodian banquet parties.\n\n\n"}

Get It Together) is the eighth studio album by the Jackson 5, released in September 1973 for the Motown label.\n\nDuring the group's last years with Motown, the label struggled to come up with material for the group. As a result, the Jackson 5 fell into a period from 1973 to 1974 where they scored no Top 10 singles. By this point, most of the Jackson 5's members, and their manager/father Joseph, were vocally complaining about the group's direction, with Michael becoming the most outspoken. The only member not to complain about Motown's handling of the act was Jermaine, who would marry Motown head Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel three months after the release of the album. \"G.I.T.: Get It Together\" would go on to sell over two million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album was arranged by Arthur G. Wright, David Blumberg and James Anthony Carmichael.\n\n\"G.I.T.: Get It Together\" was the first album to feature lead singer Michael's noticeable growth spurt, now with a slightly deeper, full-fledged tenor singing voice, as he was 14 when the album was recorded and 15 when it came out. The overall sound of the group changed as well. It was also on this album that he first employed what would later be known as his \"vocal hiccup\", notably on the song \"It's Too Late to Change the Time\". As Motown frowned on any sort of control being relinquished to the group, Michael semi-retired the hiccup until his solo career at Epic Records began in earnest with \"Off the Wall\" in 1979.\n\n\"Get It Together\" was one of the earliest albums to experiment with a pre-disco sound, released at a time before the genre was mainstream. The album was a breakaway from the group's bubblegum soul sound as they came up with a more funk-oriented album similar to the Temptations' Norman Whitfield-produced albums. Two of Whitfield's Temptations songs — \"You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You)\" and \"Hum Along and Dance\"— appeared on \"Get It Together\". Whitfield's group the Undisputed Truth also recorded the original version of \"Mama, I Got A Brand New Thing (Don't Say No)\", which appears here in a 7-minute long version with all of the Jacksons singing.\n\nThe sequence of songs was also carefully arranged for \"Get It Together\". There was no silence separating one song from the other. Each track flowed together thematically, a technique borrowed from Stevie Wonder's landmark album \"Music of My Mind\", released the year prior.\n\nThe title track, \"Get It Together\", was a modest pop hit for the group reaching No. 28, while the album-closing \"Dancing Machine\" became a smash pop hit, reaching No. 2 on the pop chart and briefly restoring the Jackson 5 back to their former success.\n\n\"Get It Together\" was also the first Jackson 5 album to feature all five Jackson brothers sharing lead vocals, giving the album a more group unified aura. Marlon, in particular, is prominently featured on \"Mama, I Got A Brand New Thing\" and Jackie and Tito lead the brothers through \"Hum Along and Dance\". In addition, the album did not feature production or songwriting from any of the now-disbanded Corporation.

{"id": "2160477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160477", "title": "Emile Zuckerkandl", "text": "Emile Zuckerkandl\n\nÉmile Zuckerkandl (July 4, 1922 – November 9, 2013) was an Austrian-born French biologist considered one of the founders of the field of molecular evolution. He is best known for introducing, with Linus Pauling, the concept of the \"molecular clock\", which enabled the neutral theory of molecular evolution.\n\nZuckerkandl was raised in Vienna, Austria in a household of intellectuals, but his family relocated in 1938 to Paris, and later Algiers, to escape the racial policy of Nazi Germany with respect to Jews. At the end of World War II, he spent one year at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), then came to the United States to study physiology—earning a master's degree in 1947 from the University of Illinois, under C. Ladd Prosser—then returned to the Sorbonne to complete a Ph.D. in biology. Zuckerkandl developed a strong interest in molecular problems; his early research at a marine biology lab in Roscoff emphasized the roles of copper oxidases and hemocyanin in the molting cycles of crabs. In 1957, Zuckerkandl met renowned chemist Linus Pauling, who was becoming interested in molecular diseases and molecular evolution as an outgrowth of his activism on topics concerning nuclear power. They arranged a post-doctoral fellowship, and Zuckerkandl (now with his wife Jane) returned to the United States to work with Pauling at the California Institute of Technology beginning in 1959. He is an atheist.\n\nZuckerkandl's first project under Pauling (working with graduate student Richard T. Jones) was the application of new protein identification techniques—a combination of paper chromatography and electrophoresis that produced a two-dimensional pattern—to hemoglobin. The peptide fragments of hemoglobin samples from different species, partially broken apart by digestive enzymes, would produce unique patterns that could be used to estimate differences of protein structure. Zuckerkandl, Jones and Pauling published a comparison of several species' hemoglobin identification patterns in 1960, observing that the degree of dissimilarity of protein patterns corresponded approximately to the phylogenetic distance between source species. However, the method was not conducive to quantitative comparisons, so Zuckerkandl began working on the determination of the actual peptide sequence of the α and β chains of human and gorilla hemoglobin.\n\nIn 1962, Pauling and Zuckerkandl published their first paper using the molecular clock concept (though not yet by that name). Like a number subsequent collaborative papers, it was not peer-reviewed—it was an invited paper in honor of Albert Szent-Györgyi—and they intentionally took the opportunity to \"say something outrageous\". The paper used the number of differences in the α and β chains of hemoglobin to infer the time since the last common ancestor for a number of species, calibrated based on paleontological evidence for humans and horses. Though the paper did not provide any explanation for why amino acid differences in a protein should accumulate at a uniform rate (the essential assumption of the molecular clock), it did show that the results were fairly consistent with those of paleontologists.\n\nDuring the succeeding years, Zuckerkandl worked to refine the molecular clock. In 1963, he and Pauling invented the term \"semantides\" for biological sequences—DNA, RNA, and polypeptides—that have evolutionary information and argued that such sequences could be the basis for constructing molecular phylogenies, suggesting that the \"molecular clock\" method might be useful for other semantides besides proteins. Emanuel Margoliash's first publication of sequence data for cytochrome c allowed comparison of the rates of molecular evolution for different proteins (cytochrome c seemed to evolve faster than hemoglobin), which Zuckerkandl discussed at a 1964 conference in Bruges. Zuckerkandl also adjusted the mathematics of the \"clock\" to account for the observation that some positions in an amino acid sequence were more stable than others, and the likelihood of multiple substitutions at the same position. In September 1964, he attended the important Evolving Genes and Proteins symposium, where he and Pauling presented their most influential paper (\"Evolutionary Divergence and Convergence in Proteins\", published in the conference proceedings the next year). The paper, primarily Zuckerkandl's work, named the \"evolutionary clock\" and presented a derivation of its basic mathematical form. Though Zuckerkandl and Pauling saw the clock as compatible with natural selection, it would later become the basis of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, in which genetic drift rather than selection is the driving force of evolution at the molecular level.\n\nIn 1965, Zuckerkandl moved back to France to direct in Montpellier, the \"Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoléculaire\" of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. In 1971, he became the founding editor of the \"Journal of Molecular Evolution\", and in the late 1970s became President of the Linus Pauling Institute (then in 1992 of its successor, the Institute of Molecular Medical Sciences). His recent work includes criticism of social constructionism and intelligent design.\n"}

As he has told in the pleasant fragment of autobiography prefixed to his works, in which, like Julius Caesar, he speaks of himself in the third person, he was a posthumous child; he went to Rome at the age of nine years, under the care of his uncle Giovanni. There he read with a private tutor, suffered severely from two fevers in succession, and was sent at last, for the sake of society, to the Jesuits' College, where he remained till his twentieth year, studying philosophy, as he says, \"rather for occupation than for learning's sake.\"\n\nLosing his uncle about this time, Chiabrera returned to Savona, \"again to see his own and be seen by them.\" In a little while, however, he returned to Rome, and entered the household of a cardinal, where he remained for several years, frequenting the society of Paulus Manutius and of Sperone Speroni, the dramatist and critic of Tasso, and attending the lectures and hearing the conversation of Mureto. His revenge of an insult offered him obliged him to betake himself once more to Savona, where, to amuse himself, he read poetry, and particularly Greek.\n\nThe poets of his choice were Pindar and Anacreon, and these he studied until it grew to be his ambition to reproduce in his own tongue their rhythms and structures, and so to enrich his country with a new form of verse in his own words, \"like his country-man, Columbus, to find a new world or drown.\" His reputation was made at once; but he seldom quit Savona, though often invited to do so, saving for journeys of pleasure, in which he greatly delighted, and for occasional visits to the courts of princes whither he was often summoned, for his verse's sake, and in his capacity as a dramatist. At the ripe age of fifty he took to himself a wife, one Lelia Pavese, by whom he had no children. After a simple and blameless life, during which he produced a vast quantity of verse — epic, tragic, pastoral, lyrical and satirical — he died in Savona on October 14, 1638. An epitaph was written for him in elegant Latin by Pope Urban VIII, but on his tombstone are graven two quaint Italian hexameters of his own, in which the gazer is warned from the poet's own example not to prefer Parnassus to Calvary.\n\nA maker of odes in all their elaborate pomp of strophe and antistrophe, a master of new and complex rhythms, a coiner of ambitious words and composite epithets, an employer of audacious transpositions and inversions, and the inventor of a new system of poetic diction, it is not surprising that Chiabrera should have been compared with Ronsard. Both were destined to suffer eclipse as great and sudden as had been their glory. Ronsard was succeeded by Malherbe and by French literature, properly so-called; Chiabrera was the last of the great Italians, and after him literature languished till the second renaissance under Manzoni. Chiabrera, however, was a man of merit, apart from that of the mere innovator. Setting aside his epics and dramas (one of the latter received the honours of translation at the hands of Nicolas Chrétien, a sort of scenic du Bartas), much of his work remains yet readable and pleasant. His grand Pindarics are dull, it is true, but some of his Canzonette, like the anacreontics of Ronsard, are exceedingly elegant and graceful. His autobiographical sketch is also extremely interesting. The simple old poet, with his adoration of Greek (when a thing pleased him greatly he was wont to talk of it as \"Greek Verse\"), his delight in journeys and sight-seeing, his dislike for literary talk save with intimates and equals, his vanities and vengeances, his pride in the memory of favours bestowed on him by popes and princes, his \"infinita maraviglia\" over Virgil's versification and metaphor, his fondness for masculine rhymes and blank verse, his quiet Christianity, is a figure deserving perhaps of more study than is likely to be bestowed on that \"new world\" of art which it was his glory to fancy his own, by discovery and by conquest.\n\nGiambattista Marino was a contemporary of Chiabrera whose verses provide a comparison.\n\n"}

Depending on the scale and type of production, the board op may be responsible for conventional or automated lighting fixtures, as well as practicals and, in some instances, controlling video as well. \n\nSometimes, most commonly in small productions, the Light board Operator will also be the stage manager. Another variation in smaller productions has the responsibilities of Light board Operator and Sound operator combined into one position. In the smallest productions, all three of these functions are done by one person. For productions where lighting and sound are operated by a single person, as well productions where sound needs to be exactly timed with lighting, it is not unusual to use MIDI Show Control (MSC), Open Sound Control (OSC), or Timecode (SMPTE Time Code) to synchronize the lighting, video, and audio consoles.\n\nThe light board operator could, in some cases, also be the lighting designer for a production.\n\nThe light op has many responsibilities in theater, especially in small productions. For small productions, the light op may also be the lighting designer and master electrician, and is therefore required to create a lighting plot, and perform a complete hang and focus in addition to their duties as board operator. In more professional environments, the light board operator is a highly specialized professional who is usually well versed in the intricacies of a wide variety of lighting instruments and control consoles, and able to easily program complex lighting cues involving multiple fixtures and other components. \n\nDuring the technical rehearsals, the light board operator usually programs the lighting console with the assistance of the lighting designer and stage manager. In situations where manual boards are being used, the light board operator will work with the lighting designer and the stage manager to practice the timing of the lighting changes.\n\nDuring the performance, the light board operator is often on headset with the Deputy Stage Manager, and multiple other members of the running crew. Their responsibility lies primarily in advancing the cues under the direction of the deputy stage manager. It is important that light board operators be familiar with the light plot, as they may be called upon to make \"on the fly\" changes to accommodate unexpected circumstances that occur during the production.\n\n\n"}

Palanpur is the administrative headquarters of the district. Palanpur is the ancestral home to an industry of Indian diamond merchants.\n\nPalanpur in early times is said to have been called Prahladana Patan or Prahaladanapura after its founder Prahladana, mentioned in Jain texts. It was afterwards re-peopled by Palansi Chauhan from whom it took its modern name. Others say that it was founded by Pal Parmar whose brother Jagadev founded nearby Jagana village.\n\nThe Jain texts mentions that Prahladana, brother of Paramara Dharavarsha of Abu, founded Prahladanapur in 1218 and built Prahladana-vihara dedicated to Pallaviya Parshwanatha. The town was re-peopled ruled by Chauhans around thirteenth century. At the start of the seventeenth century, the Palanpur State was taken over by Jhalori dynasty of the Pashtun Lohani tribe which was founded in 1373 and ruled from Jalore (Rajasthan). The dynasty came into historical prominence during the period of instability that followed the demise of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the early 18th century. It was overrun soon afterwards by the Marathas; the Lohanis followed the trend of seeking recourse in the British East India Company against them and finally entered the subsidiary alliance system in 1817, along with all other neighbouring states, becoming a British protectorate. After independence of India in 1947, Palanpur State was dissolved in 1949 and merged with Union of India as a part of Bombay State.

In Palanpur, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n♦\n\nIn 1750 (Samvat 1806), Bahadur Khan built a brick and mortar city-wall, the \"Nagarkot\" of Palanpur. It was 3 miles round, 17 to 20 feet high and 6 feet broad with seven bastioned gateways, and, at the corners, round towers armed with guns. The gateways of the city-walls were Delhi Darwaja, Gathaman Darwaja, Malan Darwaja, Mira Darwaja, Virbai Darwaja, Salempura Darwaja, Sadarpur Darwaja or Shimla Darwaja. Only Mira Darwaja survives today.\n\nSher Muhammad Khan attended the coronation ceremony of King George V in Delhi in 1910 and built a club named after him in 1913. In 1918, his successor Tale Muhammad Khan constructed Kirti Stambh, a 22 metre tower near the railway station commemorating the gallantry of his father and the history of town and his dynasty. He also built Balaram Palace between 1922 to 1936 and later Jorawar Palace (Currently used as Judicial Court) also. In 1939, he also built Shashivan, formerly Jahanara Baug, a garden to commemorate his second marriage with a daughter of an Australian businessman.\n\nThe old marketplaces are Nani Bazar, Moti Bazar and Dhalvas.

{"id": "2160511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160511", "title": "Fort Jay", "text": "Fort Jay\n\nFort Jay is a coastal star fort and the name of a former United States Army post on Governors Island in New York Harbor, within New York City. Fort Jay is the oldest existing defensive structure on the island, and was named for John Jay, a member of the Federalist Party, New York governor, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Secretary of State, and one of the founding fathers of the United States. It was built in 1794 to defend Upper New York Bay, but has served other purposes. From 1806 to 1904 it was named Fort Columbus, presumably for explorer Christopher Columbus. Today, the National Park Service administers Fort Jay and Castle Williams as the Governors Island National Monument.\n\nFort Jay is situated on Governors Island (which was known as Nutten Island from 1664 to 1784, based on Dutch \"Noten Eylandt\" for \"Nut Island\"). Specifically, the fort is located on the site of earthworks originally built to defend New York City during the American Revolution. General Israel Putnam constructed the first earthen fortification on this site starting in April 1776, and armed it with eight cannons for the defense of New York Harbor. Additional guns were later emplaced, and on July 12, 1776 the Nutten Island batteries engaged and . The American cannons inflicted enough damage to make the British commanders cautious of entering the East River, which later contributed to the success of General George Washington's August 29–30 retreat from Brooklyn into Manhattan after the defeat in the Battle of Brooklyn. The Americans abandoned the earthworks that September, resulting in the eventual British occupation of New York City. The British Army improved the existing earthworks and used the island as a British Royal Navy hospital until they departed on November 25, 1783. At that time Governors Island was conveyed to the State of New York.\n\nIn the years following the end of British occupation of New York in 1783, the works deteriorated. A decade later in 1794, the State of New York began to finance improvements to the earthworks, then in ruins. The fort was reconstructed as a square with four corner bastions, and was named after the Federalist New York governor John Jay. By 1797 Congress appropriated $30,117 for continued construction. Eventually, to allow for continued federal funding and upkeep of the works, the state conveyed Governors Island and the works at Fort Jay to the federal government in February 1800 for one dollar.\n\nIn 1806 the earthworks were replaced by granite and brick walls and the footprint of the fort enlarged to designs by Major Jonathan Williams, chief engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and supervisor of fortifications in New York Harbor. The fort was rebuilt and enlarged as part of what became known as the Second System of US seacoast fortifications. Williams replaced the earthworks with sandstone and granite walls and an arrow-shaped ravelin, all surrounded by a dry moat. The moat was in turn surrounded by a sloped grassy area or glacis that was once was cleared of trees, providing a clear field of fire toward any advancing enemy forces. The slope was also designed to retard or stop cannon shot from warships. The overall result is still evident in the fort's star-shaped design and its position on the highest point on the island. Construction of the walls and gate of the existing fort were completed in 1808. Later, small wood and brick barracks buildings were constructed in the enclosed square space.\n\nThe fortification was initially named Fort Jay for John Jay, a member of the Federalist Party, New York governor, Supreme Court Justice, Secretary of State and one of the \"founding fathers\" of the United States. Jay, as George Washington's Secretary of State, negotiated the Jay Treaty of 1794 with Great Britain. With the election of Thomas Jefferson as President in 1800 there was a shift of power from the Federalists, of which Jay was a prominent member, to the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson's party objected to the treaty, which resolved outstanding issues from the American Revolution. Following the 1806 rebuilding, and with the change in presidential administrations and the recent transfer to the federal government, the fort was renamed Fort Columbus, presumably for Christopher Columbus.\n\nThe post was renamed at some time between December 15, 1806 and July 21, 1807. Edmund Banks Smith, an Episcopal priest, Army chaplain, and author of an early history of Governors Island wrote in 1913 that this was \"supposed to have been due to Jay’s temporary unpopularity with the Republican party, which was not satisfied with the Jay Treaty with England\". However, this has not been substantiated, and no documentation for the name change has been found. The fort retained the name \"Columbus\" throughout the rest of the 19th century, finally reverting to Fort Jay in 1904.\n\nFort Columbus played an important role in the military life of New York City as the largest army post defending the city. The fortification, in concert with Fort Wood on Liberty Island, Fort Gibson on Ellis Island, Castle Clinton at the Battery in Lower Manhattan, and two other fortifications on Governors Island, South Battery and Castle Williams, provided protection for the city and Upper New York Bay. This system of coastal fortifications is credited with discouraging the British from taking any naval action against the city during the War of 1812, who preferred easier targets in the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay (resulting in the burning of Washington, DC), and the Gulf of Mexico below New Orleans.\n\nIn subsequent years, beginning in the 1820s, Fort Richmond, Fort Hamilton, and Fort Lafayette at the Narrows of New York Harbor reduced the need for the Upper Harbor forts, and in time, the Army transferred most properties in Upper New York Bay to other federal agencies or sold them to the state of New York. Fort Columbus, however, possessed , a sufficient land mass for a modest garrison at a reasonable proximity () to Manhattan, making it the most practical of the Second System forts for the Army to retain and continue to garrison.\n\nPersonnel stationed at Fort Columbus began to record meteorological observations in the 1820s.\n\nAs the closest major army post to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Fort Columbus for many years served as a first posting or a major departure point for newly graduated cadets shipping to army posts along the Atlantic or Pacific coasts. Many future generals in the Civil War were posted to or passed through Fort Columbus as young junior officers. They included John G. Barnard, Horace Brooks, Abner Doubleday, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, John Bell Hood, Theophilus H. Holmes, Thomas Jackson, Henry Wager Halleck, James B. McPherson and others.\nIn the 1830s, the protective value of Fort Columbus diminished with the advance of weapons technology, but other uses evolved for the army post. The Army renovated the fortification beginning in 1833 with the construction of four barracks that remain to the present day, replacing wooden barracks. The barracks were built as the fortification's importance in protecting New York was diminished by the construction of the new forts at The Narrows of New York Harbor. The Greek Revival style barracks, unified by two-story Tuscan porticos first served as officers' and enlisted men's housing for the permanent garrison. That same year the Ordnance Department established the New York Arsenal as a separate installation, adjacent to but not part of Fort Columbus, as a major depot taking delivery of contracted manufactured arms and weapons and distributing both contract and federally manufactured weapons to army posts across the nation. In 1836, the South Battery became the Army School of Music Practice, training young boys to become company drummers and fife players and regimental musicians.\n\nThe army located its General Recruiting Service for infantry troops at Fort Columbus in November 1852, and many regiments in the army detailed officers to Fort Columbus on recruiting details.\n\nTwice, in December 1860 and April 1861, the Army \"secretly\" dispatched troops and provisions from Fort Columbus to relieve the besieged garrison at Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. Outgoing President James Buchanan initiated the first effort, but a battery garrisoned by cadets from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina fired on the Army-chartered New York-based steamship \"Star of the West\" on January 9, 1861 as it entered Charleston Harbor. The incident provoked a crisis, prompting other southern states began to more seriously consider secession from the Union. The second effort, with new Army recruits departing from Fort Columbus on April 9, 1861, also failed when it prompted South Carolina forces to fire on Fort Sumter early in the morning of April 12, 1861, resulting in the start of the Civil War.\n\nIn the early years of the Civil War, the north barracks were used to hold Confederate officers taken as prisoners of war pending transfer to other Union prisons such as Camp Johnson in Ohio, Fort Delaware or Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. Fort Columbus and Castle Williams also served as a temporary prisoner of war camp and confinement hospital for Confederate prisoners during the war. Major General William H. C. Whiting (CSA) died of dysentery in February 1865 in the post hospital shortly after his surrender at the Battle of Fort Fisher, North Carolina. He was the highest ranking Confederate officer to die as a prisoner of war.\nLate in war and the immediate years after it, the armament of the fort was upgraded with nearly fifty and Rodman guns. As the result of a World War II scrap drive, four 10-inch and one 15-inch guns were retained at the fort's east entrance gate and north ravelin as ornaments, while the remainder were shipped on barges to steel mills in Pittsburgh, PA and scrapped for the war effort in October 1942.\n\nIn the years after the American Civil War, New York Arsenal served as a major center for disposing of surplus and excess cannons and munitions for war memorials in national cemeteries and for municipalities, scrap, or sale to foreign governments.\n\nIn 1878, as part of a servicewide cost-cutting effort, the United States Army relocated many of its administrative functions from rented quarters in large urban centers to neighboring army posts. In New York City, nearly all army functions in the city were relocated to Governors Island, making Fort Columbus the headquarters for the Division of the Atlantic and later the Department of the East. Both commands then included almost all army activities east of the Mississippi River. The prestige of a command at Fort Columbus as a premier posting ranked second only to high-ranking army positions in Washington, D.C. and many commanders went on to become Commanding General of the United States Army. Its departmental commanders from the 1880s to the 1900s included Winfield Scott Hancock, Wesley Merritt, Oliver O. Howard, Nelson Miles, Arthur MacArthur, and other combat commanders in the Civil War, the Indian Wars, and the Spanish–American War.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Fort Columbus and Governors Island began to draw the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War, Elihu Root, a former New York City lawyer. Root sought to enhance the island army post to better serve the army's needs, to fend off efforts by the City of New York to close the post and reclaim the island as a city park and a rarely stated need to provide a quick means of federal protection of Wall Street, the Customs House and Sub-Treasury in Lower Manhattan. Root instigated the expansion of the island from its original 60 acres to 172 acres with landfill from the newly constructed New York City Subway and dredge from New York Harbor. Root also commissioned the New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White to develop a master plan for the island which would demolish all the existing buildings on the island except for the three original fortifications on the island and a newly constructed chapel. The retention of the fortifications indicated Root's interest in retaining the historical structures, as some of the army decision makers he supervised were trying to accomplish their demolition. In one of his departing acts as Secretary of War in February 1904, Root restored the original name of Fort Jay to the fortification and to the army post that had evolved around it.\n\nA 1930s WPA project was the complete conversion of the barracks in Fort Jay to family housing. Each company barracks was transformed into four townhouse-style apartments that served junior officers as family housing. As a further concession to the automobile, eight two-car garages were constructed inside the fort behind the barracks to serve the fort's residents.\n\nDuring World War II Fort Jay was the headquarters of First Army in the early part of the war, and later the Eastern Defense Command (EDC), responsible for all Army units and defense coordination in the northeastern United States, and in the east coast states from Maine through Florida. These were primarily coast defense, antiaircraft, and fighter assets. US Army forces in Newfoundland and, from April 1942, Bermuda were also included in the EDC.\n\nIn November 1964 after a year of study to identify ways to downsize Department of Defense installations, the U.S. Army announced the closure of Fort Jay. The merging of Second Army duties and functions with that of First Army and relocating First Army's headquarters to Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1966 the United States Coast Guard (USCG) assumed control of Governors Island and continued to use Fort Jay to house officers until it closed its Governors Island base in September 1996.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, Fort Jay, Castle Williams and a surrounding 23 acres were proclaimed part of the Governors Island National Monument, administered by the National Park Service with Fort Jay recognized as being one of the finest remaining examples of the Second System of American military fortifications. Since 2003, both fortifications have been open to the public on a summer seasonal basis as they undergo stabilization and the remainder of the island undergoes redevelopment by the City of New York through the Trust for Governors Island.\n\n\n\n\n"}

When his Jagirdar (land-owner) came to collect the levy, Dhanna Bhagat offered two gourds. Surprised and insulted, the Jagirdar broke the gourds in anger, only to find that they were full of pearls.

It is located in Shing Mun, the area between Tsuen Wan and Sha Tin, in the New Territories.\n\nSeveral hundreds years ago, the area around the reservoir was a dense forest with very few inhabitants. At least from 1646 to 1659, Southern Ming loyalist Li Wanrong (李萬榮), leading a cohort numbering in thousands, controlled Kowloon and much of today's New Territories, collecting taxes and fortifying villages, including erecting a fortress in the lower part of the Shing Mun River valley. Hence the area became known as Shing Mun or \"fortified gate\".\n\nAfter 1669, when the Great Clearance imposed by the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty was rescinded, many Hakkas settled in this area, growing rice, tea and pineapples. In the early 20th century, there were seven villages in the area.\n\nThe Shing Mun Reservoir was built as part of the Shing Mun Water Supply Scheme formulated in 1923 to meet the increasing demand for fresh water due to the urbanisation of Kowloon. To a design by London dam engineers Messrs Binnie, Deacon & Gourley, construction began in 1933 of a dam 122 metres wide and 35 metres high which, upon completion, had a capacity of 4 billion litres. By the conclusion of Phase Three of the scheme in 1937, the dam had been extended to 85 metres in height and 13.6 billion litres capacity. The name Jubilee Reservoir (銀禧水塘) was designated to celebrate the Silver Jubilee (1935) of King George V of the United Kingdom, though the name has fallen into disuse.\n\nThe local inhabitants were resettled in other parts of the New Territories, and now some of the old villages are submerged. The remains of other villages and houses can be seen in the woods on the side of the reservoir. The remains of Gin Drinkers Line on the nearby hills show the defences of British forces against the Japanese invasion during World War II.\n\nIt is possible to see many troops of macaque monkeys around the picnic sites and in the woodland areas. To preserve the natural environment of the reservoir, its surrounding area is managed under Shing Mun Country Park. Two walking trails, Wilson Trail and MacLehose Trail, cross at the side of the reservoir.\n\nA total of 41 pre-World War II waterworks structures located in six reservoir areas, namely Pok Fu Lam Reservoir, Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs, Wong Nai Chung Reservoir, Kowloon Reservoir, Shing Mun (Jubilee) Reservoir and Aberdeen Reservoir, were declared as monuments in September 2009. The Memorial Stone of Shing Mun Reservoir was declared as one of the monuments.\n\n\n"}

It affects the economically important crop species barley, oats, wheat, maize, triticale and rice.\n\n\"Barley yellow dwarf virus\" (BYDV) is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus; the viron is not enveloped in a lipid coating. The virus is transmitted by aphids, and the taxonomy of the virus is based on genome organisation, serotype differences and on the primary aphid vector of each isolate.\n\nThe isolates and their major vectors (in parentheses) are:\n\nWhen aphids feed on the phloem of the leaf, the virus is transmitted to the phloem cells. Once inside the plant, the virus begins to replicate and assemble new virions. This process requires significant metabolic input from the plant, and causes the symptoms of barley yellow dwarf disease.\n\nThe symptoms of barley yellow dwarf vary with the affected crop cultivar, the age of the plant at the time of infection, the strain of the virus, and environmental conditions, and can be confused with other disease or physiological disorders. Symptoms appear approximately 14 days after infection. Affected plants show a yellowing or reddening of leaves (on oats and some wheats), stunting, an upright posture of thickened stiff leaves, reduced root growth, delayed (or no) heading, and a reduction in yield. The heads of affected plants tend to remain erect and become black and discoloured during ripening due to colonization by saprotrophic fungi. Young plants are the most susceptible.\n\nThe virus is transmitted from the phloem when the aphid feeds. When the aphid feeds, virions go to the aphid's hind gut, the coat protein of the virus is recognised by the hindgut epithelium, and the virion is allowed to pass into the insect's hemolymph, where it can remain indefinitely, but the virus cannot reproduce inside the aphid. The virus is actively transported into the accessory salivary gland to be released into salivary canals and ducts. The virus is then excreted in the aphid saliva during its next feeding.\n\nThe host range of BYDVs consists of more than 150 species in the Poaceae; a large number of grasses both annual and perennial are alternate hosts to BYVD and can serve as reservoirs of the virus.\n\nThere are two main sources by which a cereal crop might be infected\n\n1. By non-migrant wingless aphids already present in the field and which colonise newly-emerging crops. This is known as \"green-bridge transfer\".\n\n2. By winged aphids migrating into crops from elsewhere. These then reproduce and the offspring spread to neighbouring plants.\n\nThis is variable since it depends on viral strain, time of infection and rate of spread. Most severe losses are from early infections and can be as high as 50%.\n\n\"Green bridge\" sources must be ploughed in as early as possible. Alternatively, a desiccant herbicide should be applied 10 days prior to cultivation. Insecticide sprays may be used at crop emergence.\n\nDrilling dates prior to mid-October favors attacks from winged migrant aphids. However, yield penalties may be experienced from late drilling. Insecticide sprays in this instance are therefore aimed at killing the aphids before significant spread can occur.\n\nSynthetic pyrethroid insecticides\n"}

This work is still in print more than a century later, in the edition revised by Enoch Powell.\n\nStuart Jones began in 1911 the revision of \"A Greek-English Lexicon\", the standard dictionary of ancient Greek, with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie. A preliminary edition was published under the supervision of Stuart Jones and McKenzie in 1925, but the completed revision was published by Oxford University Press in 1940 only after both men's deaths.

His tenure in Wales would prove to be an enthusiastic one: during his time there, he learned the Welsh language and served on the committees of a number of Welsh institutions, including the council of St David's College, Lampeter, as well as Trinity College, Carmarthen, and the National Library of Wales. He also served as vice-chancellor of the federal University of Wales in 1929 and 1930.

Its inspiration is the colour and atmosphere of Italy, where Mendelssohn made sketches but left the work incomplete. Below is a snippet of a letter he wrote to his father:\nThis is Italy! And now has begun what I have always thought... to be the supreme joy in life. And I am loving it. Today was so rich that now, in the evening, I must collect myself a little, and so I am writing to you to thank you, dear parents, for having given me all this happiness.\n\nIn February he wrote from Rome to his sister Fanny,\nThe \"Italian\" symphony is making great progress. It will be the jolliest piece I have ever done, especially the last movement. I have not found anything for the slow movement yet, and I think that I will save that for Naples.\n\nThe \"Italian Symphony\" was finished in Berlin on 13 March 1833, in response to an invitation for a symphony from the London (now Royal) Philharmonic Society; he conducted the first performance himself in London on 13 May 1833 at a London Philharmonic Society concert. The symphony's success, and Mendelssohn's popularity, influenced the course of British music for the rest of the century. The Germania Musical Society of Boston gave the first performance in the United States, on 1 November 1851, with Carl Bergmann conducting.\n\nMendelssohn himself, however, remained dissatisfied with the composition, which cost him, he said, some of the bitterest moments of his career; he revised it in 1834 and even planned to write alternative versions of the second, third, and fourth movements. He never published the symphony, and it appeared in print only in 1851; thus it is numbered as his \"Symphony No. 4\", even though it was in fact the third he composed.\n\nThe symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. It is in four movements:\n\n\nThe joyful first movement, in sonata form, is followed by an impression in the subdominant minor of D minor of a religious procession the composer witnessed in Naples. The third movement is a minuet in which French horns are introduced in the trio, while the final movement (which is in the minor key throughout) incorporates dance figurations from the Roman saltarello and the Neapolitan tarantella. It is among the first large multi-movement works to begin in a major key and end in the tonic minor, another example being Brahms's first piano trio.\n\nA typical performance lasts about half an hour.\n"}

The orange-coloured flowers have a higher concentration of pelargonidin pigment, while blue flowers have a higher concentration of malvidin.

The land operated as a brewery from 1967-1999, and as a high-capacity outdoor concert venue from 1987-2005. As a music venue, Molson Park saw acts like Rage Against the Machine, Radiohead, Pearl Jam, Neil Young, Nofx, and Oasis.\n\nFrom 2002-2004, the abandoned brewery operated as the largest illegal marijuana grow-operation in Canadian history.\n\nThe current shopping centre includes a Best Buy, LA Fitness, Marshall's, and a Bed, Bath & Beyond.\n\nIn 1967, the Formosa Spring Brewery reached its bottling capacity in its Formosa, Ontario location, and began looking to expand. The 597 acre farmland was annexed from Innisfil by the City of Barrie to establish the new brewery, still under the Formosa name.\nIn 1974, Molson's purchased the land and brewery, creating a parkland, baseball diamond, and adding a drive-through beer store for cottagers driving on Highway 400.\n\nDue to a change in inter-provincial alcohol production regulations, the Molsons plant was closed and abandoned in September 2000. In late November 1999 in a last-ditch effort to save their jobs, workers staged an occupation of the plant. Following an end to the occupation, the lands were thereafter put on the market for sale, subsequently purchased by a commercial land developer and renamed 'Park Place'.\n\nIn 1987, the Toronto-based Edgefest began looking for a new open-air venue to support large acts. After considering Downsview Park, Mosport International Raceway and Cayuga Speedway, as well as a farmer's field in Oakville, the organisers settled on Molson Park, despite its 90 km ([55 mi]) distance from Toronto. In an effort to motivate fans to drive to Barrie, the 1987 Edgefest sold tickets for $1.02.\nWith an attendance of 25,000 people, the 1987 Edgefest demonstrated Molson Park as a venue for large Toronto-based festivals. Many Toronto-based festivals began to follow suit, from 1987 until its commercial redevelopment in 2005.\nNotable festivals include:\n\nOn January 12, 2004, the former Molsons plant was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million; at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history.\n\nOperating in secret for 2 years,\nthe operation was undertaken by Robert DeRosa, brother of landowner Vince DeRosa, claiming to run two companies called Ontario Pallet and Barrie Fish. In addition to the Molsons plant, there was a building on Highway 11 in Oro-Medonte Township, and a third building in St. Catharines, Ontario.\n\nDuring the undercover operation, Robert also described plans to ship cocaine from Colombia to Canada hidden inside fish. He was later tracked down and arrested in Cuba. Robert was sentenced to seven years in prison, and claimed his brother knew nothing of the marijuana operation. Robert's wife Bernice Laan, and 18-year-old son also faced charges. Charges were dropped against another man, Daniel Moore. Drago Dolic, also involved, was already serving 27 years in prison in Louisiana. 12 employees were also charged during the bust.\n\nAfter sale of the plant, legal proceedings followed concerning Vince's rights to the money from the sale. Prosecutors alleged that a seizure of the property, along with Robert's home in Phelpston, Ontario was justified under organized crime laws. Vince eventually won rights to the $4 million in proceeds from the sale, in 2014.\n\nOn October 31, 2006 commercial real estate developers North American Acquisition Inc (NAA), a subsidiary of North American Development Group, LLC (NADG) won an Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) appeal of a rezoning application that had been previously denied by the City of Barrie to rezone the Park Place lands from general industrial to business park zones, and general commercial or mixed employment.\n\nThe City of Barrie had opposed NAA's rezoning application on the basis that it would use a large portion of the City's scarce industrial lands, yet only contribute low-wage retail jobs to the local economy.\n\nIn 2002, the Park Place designs described a car-free, pedestrian-focused outdoor commercial centre hosting hotels, an IMAX cinema, and landscaping.\n\nAfter the OMB appeal, development began instead with a box store concept, blamed by developer Terry Coughlin on the 2008 economic downturn: \"We're not going to get those fashion-type stores we thought originally. A lot aren't doing too well and they’re working in outlet mode. They’re all going down to Cookstown. ... We're not going to become a fashion centre, even though it was a good idea in 2002 when we started.\"\n\nThe discrepancy between the plans and the development angered many citizens, including then-mayor Rob Hamilton who described the development as \"another mall like all the other malls, all asphalt and cars and hard objects. There'll be no landscaping and none of this warm and fuzzy stuff that it was portrayed as being. Not even close.\"\n"}

He won the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1993 and 1997 while driving for his own team. Although he never won the Bathurst 1000 like his father Barry did in 1965, Glenn started from pole position in 1994 and 1996, and finished second three times. He came close to winning the race in 1995, holding a significant lead in the closing stages, but his engine failed nine laps from the finish.\n\nSeton, father of Courtney and Aaron Seton and husband to Jayne Seton, retired from full-time racing after the 2005 V8 Supercar season. He raced Fords and Nissans in the Australian Touring Car Championship since making his debut in his father's Ford Capri in the 1984 Australian Touring Car Championship, and ran his own team for a number of years.\n\nHe raced for his father's team, in 1983 driving a Ford Capri, then Nissan Motorsport from the 1984 Australian Endurance Championship until his last year with the team in 1988, driving first in a Nissan Pulsar EXA in the 1984 Castrol 500 at Sandown in Melbourne, and then at the 1984 James Hardie 1000, both times alongside Christine Gibson, the wife of his future boss Fred Gibson. His best year with Nissan came in 1987 driving the Nissan Skyline RS DR30 when he would finish second behind Jim Richards in the ATCC. Teamed with John Bowe, Seton would then finish second in the 1987 James Hardie 1000 which that year was part of the inaugural World Touring Car Championship.\n\n1988 would be a frustrating year for Seton. Nissan introduced the new Skyline HR31 GTS-R, and with the car arriving only mid-season, the team could not get on terms with the much more powerful Ford Sierra RS500s. The cars initial unreliability saw Seton's Skyline retire from the first lap at both the Sandown 500 and Tooheys 1000, both times when the cars production based gearbox failed.\n\nFollowing this, Seton and his father Bo left the Nissan team at the end of 1988 to set up Glenn Seton Racing, which ran from 1989 to 2002, initially with Ford Sierra RS500s before moving to drive one of the new V8 Ford EB Falcons in 1992 where he became the first driver to put a Falcon into the top 10 qualifiers at Bathurst since 1984. The move to the new V8 formula would prove fruitful for Seton, winning the 1993 and 1997 Australian Touring Car Championships, while claiming pole position at Bathurst in 1994 and 1996.\n\nAt the end of 2002, Seton sold the team to Prodrive and the team name was renamed to Ford Performance Racing with Seton remaining with the team as a driver. In 2005 he moved to Dick Johnson Racing. In late 2005 after a disappointing season, Seton was sacked from Dick Johnson Racing halfway through his two-year contract.\n\nSeton was not able to find a 2006 full-time drive, so he joined Stone Brothers Racing for the two V8 Supercar endurance races with James Courtney. Brake issues hampered the #4 SBR Falcon at Sandown where it finished ninth. At Bathurst they finished third. Seton moved from Ford and joined his childhood friend and old Nissan Skyline teammate Mark Skaife and for the first time in Seton's career, to drive in a Holden Commodore VE with the Holden Racing Team as an endurance driver for 2007. He finished 13th in the Sandown 500 with Tony Longhurst and 11th in the Bathurst 1000 with Nathan Pretty. Seton again joined the Holden Racing Team in 2008, driving the #2 car with Craig Baird. The pair came 14th at the Phillip Island 500 and were running strongly at the Bathurst 1000 until a late race clash with Warren Luff put them out of the race.

{"id": "2160631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160631", "title": "The James Bond Dossier", "text": "The James Bond Dossier\n\nThe James Bond Dossier (1965), by Kingsley Amis, is a critical analysis of the James Bond novels. Amis dedicated the book to friend and background collaborator, the poet and historian Robert Conquest. Later, after Ian Fleming's death, Amis was commissioned as the first continuation novelist for the James Bond novel series, writing \"Colonel Sun\" (1968) under the pseudonym Robert Markham. \"The James Bond Dossier\" was the first, formal, literary study of the James Bond character. More recent studies of Fleming's secret agent and his world include \"The Politics of James Bond: From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen\" (2001), by the historian Jeremy Black.\n\nWritten at the Bond-mania's zenith in the 1960s, \"The James Bond Dossier\" is the first, thorough, albeit tongue-in-cheek, literary analysis of Ian Fleming's strengths and weaknesses as a thriller-writer. As a mainstream novelist, Amis respected the Bond novels, especially their commercial success, believing them 'to be just as complex and to have just as much in them as more ambitious kinds of fiction'. That was a controversial approach in the 1960s, because from early on, since the mid-1950s, the James Bond novels were criticised by some detractors for their violence, male chauvinism, sexual promiscuity, racism, and anti-Communism.\n\nDespite his intellectual respect for the Fleming canon, Amis's way of writing about it, according to his biographer Zachary Leader, ' ... partly guys academic procedures and pretensions by applying them to low-cultural objects' and, as such, is deliberately provocative. In that context, the \"Dossier\" can ' ... look like a cheeky two-fingered salute to the academic world, a farewell raspberry blown at all things pedantically donnish, in a manner Lucky Jim would surely have approved. For to Ian Fleming's \"œuvre\" Amis brought the anatomising and categorising zeal he never had devoted and never would devote to more elevated works of literature'.\n\nKingsley Amis had several motives for writing the \"Dossier\". He had recently retired from teaching and wanted to 'put behind him the more rigid austerities of university life'. He wanted to expand his range as a writer beyond poetry and mainstream fiction. The need to make more money was also a consideration. Primarily, however, he wanted to show the academics that the literature of popular culture could be as substantive as the literature of high culture. In November 1963, he announced to Conquest the idea of writing an essay of some 5,000 words about the James Bond novels. By late 1964, he had expanded the essay to book length, and submitted it to his publisher, Jonathan Cape. In one hundred and sixty pages, \"The James Bond Dossier\" methodically catalogues and analyses the activities and minutiae of secret agent 007: the number of men he kills, the women he loves, the villains he thwarts, and the essential background of Ian Fleming's Cold War world of the 1950s.\n\nAfter Fleming's death in August 1964, Glidrose Productions Ltd., owners of the international book rights, asked for Amis's editorial assessment of the uncompleted manuscript of \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", which Jonathan Cape deemed feeble, and perhaps unpublishable. He reported that the manuscript was publishable, but would require substantial modifications. Because Amis was not the only writer consulted, it remains controversial if his editorial suggestions were implemented, and to what extent Amis contributed directly to the revision of the manuscript. In the event, the \"Dossier\"'s publication was delayed a year, because Jonathan Cape asked Amis to include discussion of \"The Man With the Golden Gun\". Both books were published in 1965; later that year, Amis reviewed \"The Man With the Golden Gun\" in the \"New Statesman\".\n\n\"The James Bond Dossier\" includes most of the Bond fiction cycle, excepting \"Octopussy and The Living Daylights\" (1966), the final collection of 007 short stories, which was published after the \"Dossier\". Kingsley Amis's argument is that the Bond novels are substantial and complex works of fiction, and certainly not, as Ian Fleming's critics said, 'a systematic onslaught on everything decent and sensible in modern life'. He viewed them as popular literature, akin to that of the Science Fiction texts he critiqued in \"New Maps of Hell\" (1960).\n\nAlthough written in Amis's usual accessible, light-hearted style, \"The James Bond Dossier\" is neither patronising nor ironic — it is a detailed literary criticism of the Ian Fleming canon. In the main, he admires Fleming's achievement, yet does not withhold criticism where the material proves unsatisfactory or inconsistent, especially when the narration slips into 'the idiom of the novelette'. Amis reserves his most serious criticism for what he considered to be academically pretentious rejections of the Bond books, a theme implicitly informing much of the \"Dossier\".\n\nEach of the 14 chapters deals with one aspect of the novels — 'No woman had ever held this man' defends Bond's attitude to and treatment of women: \"Bond's habitual attitude to a girl is protective, not dominating or combative\"; 'Damnably clear grey eyes' describes M., the head of SIS: \"a peevish, priggish old monster\"; 'A glint of red' is about the villains, who have in common only physical largeness and angry eyes; and so forth. According to his first biographer, Eric Jacobs, the hand of sovietologist and scholar Robert Conquest is betrayed in Amis's precise dissertation upon the genesis and changing nomenclatures of SMERSH, the employer of the villains of the early novels. Three appendices deal, respectively, with science fiction, literature and escape, and 'sadism'. With 'almost parodic scholarly dedication', Amis provides a ten-category ('Places', 'Girl', 'Villain's Project', etc.) reference guide (pp. 156–159) to the Bond novels and short stories.\n\nTypical of Amis's approach is where he suggests several implausibilities in Bond's capture by the eponymous villain in \"Dr No\" (1958). However, that 'Bond is temporarily helpless in his creator's grip', does not matter, because 'three of Mr Fleming's favourite situations are about to come up one after the other. Bond is to be wined and dined, lectured on the aesthetics of power, and finally tortured by his chief enemy'. Earlier, Amis had discussed the matter of Bond's correct designation: 'It's inaccurate, of course, to describe James Bond as a \"spy\", in the strict sense of one who steals or buys or smuggles the secrets of foreign powers ... Bond's claims to be considered a \"counter-spy\", one who operates against the agents of unfriendly powers, are rather more substantial'.\n\nAlthough, as noted elsewhere, Amis wrote three books related to the James Bond franchise, and may or may not have contributed to one of Fleming's novels, \"The James Bond Dossier\" would end up being the only book of this type to be published under Amis's own name.\n\nIn the 1968 essay 'A New James Bond', anthologised in \"What Became of Jane Austen? And Other Questions\" (1970), Kingsley Amis revisits the literary character, and explains why he accepted the commission of writing \"Colonel Sun\" (1968), discusses the challenge of impersonating the writer Ian Fleming, and explores the stylistic and world-view differences among the spy novels of Ian Fleming, John le Carré, and Len Deighton. Moreover, under the pseudonym 'Lt.-Col. William \"Bill\" Tanner' — M.'s CoS and 007's best friend in SIS — Amis wrote his second Bond book, \"The Book of Bond, or Every Man His Own 007\" (1965), a tongue-in-cheek, how-to-manual to help the everyman find his own inner secret agent.\n\nOther studies of the James Bond phenomenon include: \"Double O Seven, James Bond, A Report\" (1964), by O. F. Snelling (revised, re-titled, and re-published on-line, in 2007, as \"Double-O Seven: James Bond Under the Microscope\" [2006]), an analysis of Bond's literary predecessors, his image, women, adversaries, and future; \"Ian Fleming: The Spy Who Came In with the Gold\" (1965), by Henry A. Zeiger, a biography of Fleming as a commercial writer; \"The Politics of James Bond: From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen\" (2001), by historian Jeremy Black, an analysis of the cultural politics of the Bond books and films; \"James Bond and Philosophy: Questions Are Forever\" (2006), edited by James B. South and Jacob M. Held, a collection of essays which discuss ethical and moral issues arising out of the Bond stories; and Simon Winder's \"The Man Who Saved Britain: A Personal Journey into the Disturbing World of James Bond\" (2006), a discussion of how post–Second World War England is represented in the novels and films.\n\n"}

{"id": "2160635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160635", "title": "Precinct of Mut", "text": "Precinct of Mut\n\nThe Precinct of Mut is an Ancient Egyptian temple compound located in the present city of Luxor (ancient Thebes), on the east bank of the Nile in South Karnak. The compound is one of the four key ancient temples that creates the Karnak Temple Complex. It is approximately 325 meters (1,066 feet) south of the precinct of the god Amun. The precinct itself encompasses approximately 90,000 square meters (968,751 square feet) of the entire area. The Mut Precinct contains at least six temples: the Mut Temple, the Contra Temple, and Temples A, B, C, and D (Fazzini, 1983, p. 18). Surrounding the Mut Temple proper, on three sides, is a sacred lake called the Isheru. To the south of the sacred lake is a vast amount of land currently being excavated by Dr. Betsy Bryan and her team from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. \nToday, most of the compound is still destroyed, but it is currently being renovated. Surrounding the Mut Temple, the Contra Temple, and Temples A, B, C, and D, is an enclosure wall made of mud brick dating to the 30th Dynasty. The Mut Temple proper was made of mediocre sandstone and it is positioned north and south and is directly aligned with the Precinct of Amun. The Contra Temple, also made of mediocre sandstone, borders the Mut Temple at the south end of it, hence the name, and it possibly dates to the 30th Dynasty with certain alternations made during the Ptolemaic period. The purpose of the Contra Temple is still unclear, however, Fazzini (1983) states that it possibly served as a stopping point in a partially columned passage around the Mut Temple. In the northeast corner is the structure known as Temple A and according to Brooklyn Museum’s exhibition on the Precinct of Mut, it was also called the \"Temple of Millions of Years\" and was dedicated to Ramsses II and the god Amun-Ra. Within the temple are two stelae, one referring to Ramsses II’s work on Temple A and the other telling of his marriage to Hittite princess. The Brooklyn Museum states that Temple A did not become a part of the Mut Precinct until the 25th Dynasty under the reign of the Kushite king, Taharqa and during which time it became a birthing house, \"mammisi\", where Ancient Egyptians would celebrate the birth of the god Khonsu, the son of Amun-Ra and Mut. \nTo the east of the Mut Temple is a ruined building referred to as, Temple B, due to the amount of damage of Temple B, excavations are difficult to undergo. To the west of the sacred lake, Isheru, lies Temple C, a small temple built by Ramsses III, it still retains some military scenes on the outer walls, as well as two headless giants of the king himself before the entrance of the temple (Wilkinson, 2000, p. 164). Temple D, or Structure D, was a chapel made during the Ptolemaic period, the front room was dedicated to the goddess Mut and the back room shows evidence of being dedicated to a Ptolemaic ancestor cult. The Brooklyn Museum mentions one other important monument found on the site is the Taharqa gateway that is about 7 yards wide and is oriented south and west, it was built to enlarge the Mut Precinct and opened a new pathway to Temple A. The sacred lake, Isheru, was man made and held religious importance to the cult of the goddess Mut.\n\nThe goddess Mut is the wife and consort of the god Amun-Ra. She was also known as the Mother Goddess, Queen of the Goddesses, and Lady of Heaven (Fazzini, 1983, p. 16). Mut was the Egyptian sky goddess and her symbols were the vulture, lioness and the crown of Uraeus (rearing cobra). She was the mother of Khonsu, the god of the moon. Amun-Ra, Mut, and Khonsu made up the Theban Triad (Fazzini, 1983, p. 16).\n\nAmenhotep III was originally thought to have been the first to build the Mut Temple, but now evidence tells us he contributed later to the site. The earliest dated cartouches are of Thutmose II and III of the 18th Dynasty (some evidence suggest that Thutmose’s name is likely a replacement for Hatshepsut’s erased name) (Waraksa, 2009, p. 4). According to Elizabeth Waraksa (2009), during the 19th Dynasty, Ramsses II worked broadly on Temple A, he placed two massive statues of himself and two alabaster stelae in the front of the temple’s first pylon. During the 20th Dynasty, Ramsses III built Temple C, it was used until the 25th Dynasty when it then became a quarry for renovations for Temple A. During his reign, Kushite ruler Taharqa in the 25th Dynasty made major changes to the Mut Precinct. He built a new sandstone gateway in the northwest of the site that leads to Temple A. He also renovated parts of the Mut Temple proper, erecting a columned porch facing the south. Ptolemy VI during the Ptolemaic period erected a small chapel inside the Mut Temple proper. Several stelae found on the site, mention construction on the site by Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD.\n\nMany travelers, like Napoleon and Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson visited the Precinct of Mut between AD 1799 and 1845 (Fazzini, 1983, p. 18). The photographs, journals and maps that dated to the early excavations have added an exceptional insight as to how the Mut Precinct could have looked at the time of each exploration (Waraksa, 2009, p. 6). However, the first major excavation of the site did not occur until 1895, when Britons Margaret Benson and Janet Gourlay excavated the Precinct of Mut for three seasons (1895–7). During her excavations Benson cleared the First and Second courts, as well as the Contra Temple and uncovered many top condition pieces of statues (Waraksa, 2009, p. 7). In 1899, she publicized her work, The Temple of Mut in Asher. Excavations were not continued until the 1920s, when Maurice Pillet resumed excavating the Mut Precinct. During his excavations he restored Temples A and C. Later in 1976, Richard A. Fazzini and the Brooklyn Museum of Art, with assistance from the Detroit Institute of Arts, did an efficient investigation of the entire Mut Precinct up until 2001. Starting in January 2001, Dr. Betsy M. Bryan, in association with Johns Hopkins University, began working on the site until 2004. In the winter of 2015, Dr. Bryan went to work on excavating the site again.\n\nThe site is most famous for the statues of the lion-headed goddess Sekhmet (Lythgoe, 1919, p. 3). The statues are made of diorite or \"black granite\" and initially approximately 570 granodiorite statues were thought to have been at the Precinct of Mut at one time. According to Lythgoe (1919), Amenhotep III, commissioned the many statues to be built as a \"forest\". Amenhotep III described Sekhmet as the terrible, mighty goddess of war and strife and her origins came from the earlier Memphite triad as the mother-goddess, and she eventually became recognized with the local Theban deity, Mut (Lythgoe, 1919, p. 3). According to Porter and Moss (1960), most of the statues came from the actual site, but some possibly came from the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III on the west bank of the Nile. Today the statues can be found in various museums across the globe; in Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts has one seated statue, the Egyptian Museum, Cairo has six statues, and in London, the British Museum has thirty statues, just to name a few examples.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2004, the Johns Hopkins expedition catalogued quite a number of female figurines found in the industrial areas south of the Sacred Lake. According to Waraksa (2009) after the four seasons of excavation, the total number of female figurines the expedition found was 42. There are six types of female figurines that can be found at the Mut Temple. Type 1 are handmade figures of nude females made out of marl clay. Type 2 depict women laying on beds and they can be made in fired clay or limestone. Type 3 figurines are molded from Nile silt or marl clay with flat backs, heavy hairstyles and high foreheads (Waraksa, 2009, p. 31). The backs of the Type 3 figurines could smoothed by hand or a flat instrument of some kind. Type 4 are made from Nile silt as well and are greatest identified by their pinched heads, projecting arms facing outwards, one existing breast and wide hips. Type 5 figurines are similar to Type 3 in some ways, but they have flat, thin bodies with a smooth finish unlike Type 3 that have thicker and a somewhat rougher appearance. And Type 6, all the figurines found of this type are the lower bodies of females, these figurines appear to be the smallest-sized found at the Mut Precinct and seem to be handmade from Nile silt with a focus on having a large pubic triangle. The significance of these 42 figurines at the Mut Precinct is still questioned, however, Waraksa (2009) suggests that possible functions of the figurines could be connected to childbearing, as well as health related rituals.\n\nFor the last 15 years, Dr. Bryan has led the excavation behind the Sacred Lake. Between 2002 and 2004, the excavation of the Mut Precinct, conducted by Dr. Bryan and her team, revealed a section of New Kingdom work fixings that included baking and brewing centers, as well as granaries. In January 2006, the expedition after clearing some debris found a life-sized statue of Queen Tiy, the wife of Amenhotep III, made of granite and that dates back to the 21st Dynasty (Bryan, 2008, p. 31). Dr. Bryan and her team discovered human remains south of the Sacred Lake in 2011, what was interesting about the remains is the orientation of the body, it was faced down and appeared to be constrained, even more interesting is the location of the skull, it seems as if it was purposely placed underneath a sandstone base for a wooden column (\"Hopkins in Egypt Today\"). In 2012, The Johns Hopkins University expedition, directed by Bryan, found burials behind the Sacred Isheru Lake. Now in January 2015, the main goal of the JHU expedition is to excavate what is now considered a cemetery behind the sacred lake.\n\nBryan, B. M.

This recording saw the reunion of Black Sabbath's \"Tyr\"-era line-up from 1990, with the return of Neil Murray and Cozy Powell. It was the last album to feature Tony Martin on vocals, Geoff Nicholls on keyboards, and the last by the band until 2013 when Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler returned for the album \"13\". The album sold 21,000 copies in the U.S in its first week and as of 2013, \"Forbidden\" has sold 191,000 copies in the US.\n\nThe album received a generally negative response from critics and fans alike. After its release, the band underwent several line-up changes and found itself at a career crossroads. However, original Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne would reconcile with guitarist Tony Iommi not long afterwards.\n\nThe recording of \"Forbidden\" followed some late lineup changes within the band, with Butler replaced by Murray and Powell returning in the immediate aftermath of the 1994 \"Cross Purposes\" tour. Writing and rehearsals took place at Bluestone Farm in Wales, ahead of recording at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool that December. According to a July 1995 interview by Tony Iommi for the Boston radio station WBCN, the album took 10 days to record. The album was launched in June 1995.\nMusically, the release draws on traditional heavy metal and power metal styles as well as influences from blues. The album's opening track, \"The Illusion of Power\", features a verse by Ice-T of the metal band Body Count, delivering a spoken word part during the song's bridge.\n\nBody Count member Ernie C produced, recorded, and mixed the album.\n\n\"Forbidden\" was panned by critics upon its release. AllMusic's Bradley Torreano gave the album only one and a half stars, remarking that \"with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan\". He also stated that he considered it a \"sad state of affairs\" given the band's long history. \"Blender\" magazine called \"Forbidden\" \"an embarrassment ... the band's worst album\".\n\nBand members have since spoken about their mixed opinions of the album. Vocalist Tony Martin made known his feelings in an interview in July 2011, during which he stated: \"Well, \"Forbidden\" is... I want to say 'crap', but it's actually not\". He added that he thought the songs worked in rehearsals, but other factors, such as rumours of a reunion of the original Black Sabbath line-up and the record company wanting to \"take [the album] and see what Ice-T wanted to do\", gave the album a \"distinct ill feeling\". Martin also maintained that he never believed a \"Run-D.M.C. type\"/\"Rap Sabbath\" album would work. Rob Zombie gave some lighter praise at the launch, stating \"There is one easy way to figure out the lasting power of Black Sabbath. There's always certain bands that get a great reaction and Black Sabbath is always one of them.\"\n\nIn regards to the subsequent original line-up reunion, Martin has also said \"Forbidden\" was a \"filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion\", but remarked that he \"wasn’t privy to that information at the time\".\n\nGuitarist Tony Iommi has admitted to Sabbath fanzine \"Southern Cross\" that he was \"not happy\" with \"Forbidden\". He elaborated by saying, \"We brought in Ernie C to do production, which was a bit difficult really, because I had to leave him to it… One of the problems was we weren't all there at the same time, when we were writing it. Cozy and Neil were still contracted to do other stuff, so it ended up with just Tony Martin, Geoff Nicholls and myself just jamming around and putting ideas down. It all came together very quickly and we didn't have time to reflect: make sure it was the right songs and the right way of doing it.\" Iommi reiterated his dissatisfaction with the album to the Birmingham Mail newspaper.\n\nBlack Sabbath\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n\n"}

When Wagner was obliged to leave Munich in March 1866, he moved to a spacious villa in Tribschen on a headland projecting into Lake Lucerne. It was while he was living here that Wagner completed the score of \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\", composed his \"Emperor March\" and the third act of \"Siegfried\", and began \"Götterdämmerung\". \n\nIt was also at Tribschen that he composed his \"Siegfried Idyll\" as a birthday gift to his second wife, Cosima, who had recently given birth to the couple's first legitimate child, a son Siegfried. The couple had had two children while Cosima was married to conductor Hans von Bülow. The \"Siegfried Idyll\" was performed for the first time on Christmas morning, 25 December 1870, by an ensemble of fifteen players (among them Richter, Ruhoff, Rauchenecker and Kahl) on the stairs of the villa. It was a birthday present for Cosima; she had turned 33 the previous day, 24 December, but she always celebrated her birthday on Christmas Day. One of the guests present at this performance was the newly appointed 26-year-old Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Basel, Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nToday the villa is a museum.\n"}

He first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" v3 #74, (June 1996), and was created by Ron Marz and Darryl Banks.\n\nGrayven is the third son of Darkseid, born of an unknown mother and apparently without his father's knowledge, younger brother to Kalibak and Orion. Grayven leads a campaign of destruction against the cosmos, destroying planets. He leads a campaign against the Darkstars, a galactic police force, killing many of their number. His campaign comes to an end on the planet Rann. He desires a zeta beam device, a product of Rannian science that provides instantaneous transportation on a grand scale. He intends to zeta beam his forces onto Apokolips, announce his presence to his father, and conquer the planet.\n\nWhile the remaining Darkstars engaged Grayven's army, Green Lantern Kyle Rayner faces off against the man himself. Assisted by former Green Lantern and current Darkstar John Stewart, who suffers serious injuries in the fight, Kyle tricks Grayven into a Zeta Beam device, where he is teleported off Rann. Lacking their leader, Grayven's forces retreated.\n\nUnknown to Stewart, Rayner had inadvertently teleported Grayven deep within Earth's core. He eventually digs himself out, and seeks Rayner in New York City, who is seemingly able to overpower Grayven. Fearing defeat at the Green Lantern's hands, Grayven used an experimental teleporter, freeing himself, and in the process, sending Rayner into the 30th century. \n\nGrayven next appeared during the Imperiex crisis, as part of an alien alliance that also included Maxima, Starfire, Adam Strange, and Darkseid. They sought to eliminate Imperiex, a cosmic giant who destroys whole solar systems. In \"Adventures of Superman\" #595, (Oct 2001) Grayven is under the influence of Brainiac-13, a major force in the Imperiex War. He confronts Superman and Darkseid on the surface of Apokolips. He is defeated by Superman, then punished by Darkseid, who feels it is his duty to do so because Grayven has 'shamed himself'. Soon, Grayven is banished to Earth.\n\nDuring his banishment to Earth, Grayven is infected with a variant of Joker toxin that causes insanity. He attempts to perform at, and then destroy, a comedy club. Kyle Rayner again stops him. Grayven later reappeared in \"Ion: Guardian of the Universe\". There he is revealed to have sent Nero and Effigy after Kyle Rayner. Grayven also is implied to be part of some larger conspiracy, most likely that of the Sinestro Corps due to his hunting of escaped Qwardians and knowledge of Kyle's sick mother. Rayner blasts Grayven into unconsciousness.\n\nGrayven has since appeared in \"Five of a Kind: Thunder/Martian Manhunter\", lobotomized and nearly catatonic. Thunder and Martian Manhunter restore his mind and assist him in building a zeta beam generator meant to send the unknown scourge of the New Gods (as seen in Countdown) to Darkseid's throne room. This would force Darkseid and the killer to fight, with the result benefitting Grayven either way. Thunder and J'onn trick Grayven, however; J'onn shapeshifts into the Black Racer, the New Gods' incarnation of Death, which prompts Grayven to use the zeta beam on himself to escape. Moments later at his destination, he is found and murdered by the real killer (later revealed to be Infinity-Man).\n\nGrayven possesses formidable super-strength and endurance. Additionally, as a New God, he cannot die from natural causes. His greatest power is a limited form of the Omega Effect used by his father Darkseid. His power levels are high enough to easily fight the Green Lantern Kyle Rayner and the Darkstars, yet not enough to take on Superman, who easily defeated him with a single blow.\n\n\n"}

New features for the browser included multi-touch gesture support, tabbed browsing, a new UI, smooth zoom in/out animations, and a hybrid rendering engine of the Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 desktop versions. According to Engadget and Gizmodo, rendering speed and quality has significantly improved and was now on par with those of competing mobile browsers based on WebKit.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress 2011 in February, 2011, Microsoft unveiled a major upgrade to Internet Explorer Mobile based on the rendering engine of Internet Explorer 9. Like its desktop counterpart, the browser features full hardware acceleration. Changes in this version included moving the address bar to the bottom of the screen and having it present in landscape orientation. Microsoft showed a number of HTML5 demonstrations for the browser. This is the last version supported on Windows Phone 7.\n\nIn the Windows Phone Developer Summit in June 2012, Microsoft revealed that the next version of Windows Phone, Windows Phone 8, will come with the same web browsing engine to be used in Windows 8 PCs and tablets. IE10 Mobile will be faster and more secure, with advanced anti-phishing features like SmartScreen Filter to block dangerous websites and malware. With the help of shared core between IE10 Desktop and IE10 Mobile, Internet Explorer 10 Mobile supports a broader range of the HTML5 capabilities (including pointer events) and boosts applications/websites' performance. When it finally came out IE10 Mobile out-performed the Galaxy S III, HTC One S, and iPhone 4S on iOS 6 Beta in the SunSpider benchmark.\n\nOn July 15, 2014, Microsoft released Windows Phone 8.1, which includes the new Internet Explorer Mobile 11 browser. This version gets even closer to the desktop counterpart, by carrying over many of its improvements.\n\nNew features include:\n\n\nFurthermore, the button to refresh the page is now placed on the address bar, and the open tabs can be displayed on other Microsoft devices besides the smartphone in use: if a user is logged in with his Microsoft account on both his Windows 8.1 device and Windows Phone device, tabs on Internet Explorer 11 will synchronize automatically.\n\nMicrosoft made several changes to Internet Explorer Mobile to make the browser more compatible with sites designed for mobile Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android). To accomplish this, Microsoft adopted features used in Safari and Chrome, emulates legacy WebKit features, and claims to web servers that it is iOS or Android compatible. The new version of Internet Explorer Mobile was released with Windows Phone 8.1 Update.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2160676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160676", "title": "Coastal geography", "text": "Coastal geography\n\nCoastal geography is the study of the constantly changing region between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It includes understanding coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and the ways in which humans interact with the coast\n\nThe waves of different strengths that constantly hit against the shoreline are the primary movers and shapers of the coastline. Despite the simplicity of this process, the differences between waves and the rocks they hit result in hugely varying shapes.\n\nThe effect that waves have depends on their strength. Strong waves, also called destructive waves, occur on high-energy beaches and are typical of winter. They reduce the quantity of sediment present on the beach by carrying it out to bars under the sea. Constructive, weak waves are typical of low-energy beaches and occur most during summer. They do the opposite to destructive waves and increase the size of the beach by piling sediment up onto the berm.\n\nOne of the most important transport mechanisms results from wave refraction. Since waves rarely break onto a shore at right angles, the upward movement of water onto the beach (swash) occurs at an oblique angle. However, the return of water (backwash) is at right angles to the beach, resulting in the net movement of beach material laterally. This movement is known as beach drift (Figure 3). The endless cycle of swash and backwash and resulting beach drift can be observed on all beaches. This may differ between coasts.\nProbably the most important effect is longshore drift (LSD)(Also known as Littoral Drift), the process by which sediment is continuously moved along beaches by wave action. LSD occurs because waves hit the shore at an angle, pick up sediment (sand) on the shore and carry it down the beach at an angle (this is called swash). Due to gravity, the water then falls back perpendicular to the beach, dropping its sediment as it loses energy (this is called backwash). The sediment is then picked up by the next wave and pushed slightly further down the beach, resulting in a continual movement of sediment in one direction. This is the reason why long strips of coast are covered in sediment, not just the areas around river mouths, which are the main sources of beach sediment. LSD is reliant on a constant supply of sediment from rivers and if sediment supply is stopped or sediment falls into a submarine canals at any point along a beach, this can lead to bare beaches further along the shore.\n\nLSD helps create many landforms including barrier islands, bay beaches and spits. In general LSD action serves to straighten the coast because the creation of barriers cuts off bays from the sea while sediment usually builds up in bays because the waves there are weaker (due to wave refraction), while sediment is carried away from the exposed headlands. The lack of sediment on headlands removes the protection of waves from them and makes them more vulnerable to weathering while the gathering of sediment in bays (where longshore drift is unable to remove it) protects the bays from further erosion and makes them pleasant recreational beaches.\n\n\nIn tropical regions in particular, plants and animals not only affect the weathering of rocks but are a source of sediment themselves. The shells and skeletons of many organisms are of calcium carbonate and when this is broken down it forms sediment, limestone and clay.\n\nThe main physical Weathering process on beaches is salt-crystal growth. Wind carries salt spray onto rocks, where it is absorbed into small pores and cracks within the rocks. There the water evaporates and the salt crystallises, creating pressure and often breaking down the rock. In some beaches calcium carbonate is able to bind together other sediments to form beachrock and in warmer areas dunerock. Wind erosion is also a form of erosion, dust and sand is carried around in the air and slowly erodes rock, this happens in a similar way in the sea were the salt and sand is washed up onto the rocks.\n\nThe sea level on earth regularly rises and falls due to climatic changes. During cold periods more of the Earth's water is stored as ice in glaciers while during warm periods it is released and sea levels rise to cover more land. Sea levels are currently quite high, while just 18,000 years ago during the Pleistocene ice age they were quite low. Global warming may result in further rises in the future, which presents a risk to coastal cities as most would be flooded by only small rises. As sea levels rise, fjords and rias form. Fjords are flooded glacial valleys and rias are flooded river valleys. Fjords typically have steep rocky sides, while rias have dendritic drainage patterns typical of drainage zones. As tectonic plates move about the Earth they can rise and fall due to changing pressures and the presence of glaciers. If a beach is moving upwards relative to other plates this is known as isostatic change and raised beaches can be formed.\nThis is found in the U.K. as above the line from the Wash to the Severn estuary, the land was covered in ice sheets during the last ice age. The weight of the ice caused northeast Scotland to sink, displacing the southeast and forcing it to rise. As the ice sheets receded the reverse process happened, as the land was released from the weight. At current estimates the southeast is sinking at a rate of about 2 mm per year, with northeast Scotland rising by the same amount.\n\nIf the coast suddenly changes direction, especially around an estuary, spits are likely to form. Long shore drift pushes the sediment along the beach but when it reaches a turn as in the diagram, the long shore drift does not always easily turn with it, especially near an estuary where the outward flow from a river may push sediment away from the coast. The area may also be shielded from wave action, preventing much long shore drift. On the side of the headland receiving weaker waves, shingle and other large sediments will build up under the water where waves are not strong enough to move them along. This provides a good place for smaller sediments to build up to sea level. The sediment, after passing the headland will accumulate on the other side and not continue down the beach, sheltered both by the headland and the shingle.\n\nSlowly over time sediment simply builds on this area, extending the spit outwards, forming a barrier of sand. Once in a while, the wind direction will change and come from the other direction. During this period the sediment will be pushed along in the other direction. The spit will start to grow backwards, forming a 'hook'. After this time the spit will grow again in the original direction. Eventually the spit will not be able to grow any further because it is no longer sufficiently sheltered from erosion by waves, or because the estuary current prevents sediment resting. Usually in the salty but calm waters behind the spit there will form a salt marshland. Spits often form around the breakwater of artificial harbours requiring dredging.\n\nOccasionally, if there is no estuary then it is possible for the spit to grow across to the other side of the bay and form what is called a bar, or barrier. Barriers come in several varieties, but all form in a manner similar to spits. They usually enclose a bay to form a lagoon. They can join two headlands or join a headland to the mainland. When an island is joined to the mainland with a bar or barrier it is known as a tombolo. This usually occurs due to wave refraction, but can also be caused by isostatic change, a change in the level of the land (e.g. Chesil Beach).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the Speaker of the Assembly from June 2005 until October 2012—to date, the only Labor member ever to hold the post. Prior to holding the speakership, she had served as Health Minister from 2001 to 2003.\n\nJane Aagaard was born in Melbourne, Victoria in 1956, to John Stuart McIntosh and Jean Brown. She moved to Brisbane, Queensland at the age of seven, where she was educated at Somerville House, a school for girls in South Brisbane.\n\nIn 1986, she accepted a position with the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy, and settled with her husband in Darwin.\n\nAagaard also became heavily involved in many aspects of the Darwin community. She helped found the Brolga Awards and Northern Territory Sports Awards, and continued organising both presentations for several years. Not long before entering parliament, she had also organised the city's commemoration of its bombing by Japanese forces during World War II.\n\nWhen former Chief Minister Stephen Hatton, the longtime CLP member for Nightcliff, retired at the 2001 election, Aagaard ran as the Labor candidate against Hatton's son, Jason. In a shock result, Aagaard won the seat on an unexpectedly large swing of 11.7 percent that saw the previously marginal Nightcliff technically become a safe Labor seat. Aagaard's victory was part of a six-seat swing to Labor that saw the party win government for the first time ever, mainly on the strength of a strong performance in the Darwin area. She was reelected in 2005, picking up a healthy swing of 8.5 percent\n\nIn March 2012, Aagaard announced that she would not contest the next election due to \"ongoing medical issues that would require treatment and surgery\". In November 2012, Aagaard was granted the title The Honourable for life.\n"}

On February 3, 1982, Parliamentary Bill No. 568 was enacted by the Batasang Pambansa in session assembled, transferring the site of Provincial Government of Lanao del Norte from Iligan City to Municipality of Tubod, making it the \"Capital town\" of the Lanao del Norte.\n\nRufo dela Cruz was sworn into office as the appointed Municipal Mayor on March 14, 1947. In the local election of 1947, Fausto Alvia as elected as Municipal Mayor.\n\nOn March 22, 1949, President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 208, creating the municipality of Lala from the barrios of Rawaan, Gumagamut, Lala (poblacion), Simpak, Daromawang, Abagan, and Lanipao.\n\nOn June 10, 1949, the President Quirino issued Executive Order No. 222 creating the Municipality of Baroy whereby all the elected Municipal Officials except the councilor Arsenio A. Quibranza, opted to served Baroy thus leading to the appointment of the Municipal Officials of Tubod with the Arsenio A. Quibranza as Municipal Mayor effective June 24, 1949.\n\nIn 1951 local elections the latter was elected as the Municipal Mayor and was re-elected twice during the 1955 and 1959 local elections, his term ended on March 8, 1962 when he was appointed by President Diosdado Macapagal as Vice Governor of Lanao del Norte. By the law of succession, the Vice Mayor Trifon A. Tabuco became the Municipal Mayor of Tubod and held the position until December 31, 1963. In the 1963 election, Jesus Perez was elected Municipal Mayor and was re-elected also in the 1967 election whose term ended on December 31, 1971. In 1971 election, the Marcelino Pepito was elected Municipal Mayor whose term ended on January 31, 1979 when Romana dela Cruz Neri too her oath and assumed office as appointed Municipal Mayor. In 1980 election, the latter was elected as the Municipal Mayor whose term ended as an aftermath of the February 25, 1986 EDSA Revolution. The Municipal government of Tubod was governed since by OICs Panfilo dela Cruz, Rooseque B. Calacat and Panfilo Labunog, respectively, until January 31, 1988. In the February 2, 1988 election, the Romana dela Cruz Neri was elected again as the Municipal Mayor of Tubod. She held the same office until she was defeated by Constancio A. Pepito in 1992 synchronized national and local elections, who held the position for three consecutive terms. In 2001 elections, Eduardo C. Mansueto was elected as Municipal Mayor and held the position for three consecutive terms. During the national and local election in 2010, the Nelieta Quibranza-Noval, who boarded the wagon of politics just like her father the late Arsenio A. Quibranza, was elected as Municipal Mayor and re-elected during the 2016 national and local election but she died on September 7, 2016.\n\nTubod is the site of the Mindanao Civic Center which houses a hotel, cafeteria, gym, swimming pool, oval, and other sports facilities. MCC is a 71-hectare integrated complex with 5-hectare provincial trade center, 18-hectare sports facilities with 48-hectares still open for the proposed 18-hole golf course, picnic park and sports academy. The gymnasium capacity was 3,500 and the main stadium was 5,000. MCC was the first sports hub of the First Mindanao Friendship Games.\n\nAnd also, MCC is the site of several motorcross events in the country, giving the distinction of Tubod and the whole province as the \"Motorcross Capital of the Philippines\".\n\nTubod is primarily an agricultural towny. Of its land area of 24,000, 80.7% is dedicated to agricultural use with a large percentage planted with bananas. Therefore, the ups and downs of the economic situation of the people in the interior barangay is more or less dependent on banana Industry. Cognizant with the bright prospect of banana products playing a vital role of livelihood of the people, in 1986, the LGU of Tubod,Lanao del Norte initiated the conceptualization of a festival that would give an all out emphasis on Council was organizeds to assist the LGU of Tubod in designing what is now known as the Sagingan Festival, as well as to determined priority measures to enhance the product of the economic symbol of Tubod. With close coordination of the Department of Agriculture, the banana yields of Tubod were given special treatment ( ex. Research, variety classification, soil analysis etc.).

The celebration highlighted the presentation of the different varieties of bananas In Tubod (52 varieties as of last count). Seeing the festival enlightens the Tubodnons on the importance of Bananas in generation income, it was enhanced, developed, and sustained by the LGU of Tubod. Indeed, from the time, a portion of the LGU’s 20% development fund was allocated for the Sagingan Festival. In 1992, Sagingan Festival was officially accredited with the Department of Tourism and included in the calendar festival in the entire Philippines. There festivals are highlighted with Street dancing Competition, Best Decorated Caromata, Booth Contest, Search for Ms. Sagingan Festival which use of 75% of Banana materials, banana Festival, and Agro-industrial Trade Fair.

His main strength is individual time trials and his career highlights include stage wins in all three Grand Tour stage races and winning the US National Time Trial Championship seven times. Zabriskie is known for his quirky nature, including singing before stages and the interviews he does with fellow riders in the professional peloton which are posted on his web site.\n\nIn 2005, he became the third American to wear the leader's yellow jersey at the Tour de France, after winning the prologue of that year's Tour. However, later admissions of drug use during that time caused him to be stripped of his stage win and the resulting yellow jersey.\n\nOn October 10, 2012 – while a member of the squad – it was announced by USADA that he would be suspended for six months for admissions of doping during his time with the US Postal Cycling Team. Later that day, Zabriskie confirmed his acceptance of a six-month ban from September 1, 2012 ending on March 1, 2013 along with a stripping of all race results between May 13, 2003 and July 31, 2006.\n\nZabriskie was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and graduated from Olympus High School in 1997, and made his professional debut with the Colorado Cyclist team in 1999. After displaying his talent for time trials by winning the US National Time Trial Championships (junior and under-23 age categories) and the Grand Prix des Nations (under-23 category), Zabriskie moved on to the team in 2001.\n\nZabriskie seriously injured his left leg and wrist in 2003 while descending Mill Creek Canyon near Salt Lake City when a vehicle pulled into his lane and collided with him. Upon announcing his retirement in 2013, Zabriskie stated that the injury to his leg still bothered him and indicated it contributed to his decision to retire. Following a year of rehabilitation, he returned to form in 2004, winning the Elite US National Time Trial Championships. He also won stage 11 of the Vuelta a España in a 162 km solo breakaway, marking his first Grand Tour stage win—especially notable among his victories for not being a time trial. In the 2005 season Zabriskie switched to , where he racked up another Grand Tour stage victory by winning the 8th stage of the 2005 Giro d'Italia.\nDespite success on the international cycling scene, Zabriskie did not receive much attention in his native United States until the 2005 Tour de France, when he won the stage 1 time trial, making him the first American to win stages in all three Grand Tours. Zabriskie beat Lance Armstrong by two seconds clocking an average speed of 54.676 km/h. He wore the leader's yellow jersey until the team time trial on stage 4, where he crashed within the final two kilometres, a crash determined as a chain slip though Zabriskie himself did not know what had happened. After the crash, Zabriskie suffered from his injuries and on stage 8, he arrived last, 51'12\" after winner Pieter Weening. Zabriskie abandoned the race in the 9th stage after 11 km. Before Zabriskie had fully recovered from his crash in the Tour de France, a swinging glass door at a restaurant injured his hand badly enough to end his 2005 season. Back home from the Tour de France, Zabriskie was honored in Utah by the declaration of \"Dave Zabriskie Day\" by the mayors of both Salt Lake County and Salt Lake City.\n\nZabriskie's 2006 season started out well, with a strong 2nd-place finish in the February stage race Amgen Tour of California, 29 seconds after the winner, countryman Floyd Landis. He was initially placed 3rd in the April stage race Ford Tour de Georgia, but as he lost time to the favourite riders on the Brasstown Bald mountain stage, he finished 6th place overall. Dave Zabriskie won two time trials in the Dauphiné Libéré in May, beating Floyd Landis in the prologue by two seconds, and winning Stage 3 by 53 seconds, again ahead of Landis, further proving Zabriskie's outstanding time trialing skills. Following several mountain stages, including a ride up the Mont Ventoux, Zabriskie finished the race in 32nd place, behind winner Levi Leipheimer. Upon completing the 2006 Tour de France in 74th place, Zabriskie became the second American behind Christian Vande Velde to finish all three Grand Tours.\n\nOn September 1, 2007, Zabriskie won the US National Time Trial Championship for the third time. He finished The Cliffs South Carolina 18.7 mile course in 39 minutes, 34 seconds (28.4 miles/hour average speed) which was just one second ahead of second-place finisher Danny Pate.\n\nAfter helping his team win the first stage team time trial at the Giro d'Italia, Zabriskie crashed in the Giro's second stage and had to abandon the race due to a fractured first vertebrae. Zabriskie was selected as one of the five riders for the US Olympic road race team and one of the two for the time trial. Later that year, Zabriskie placed 12th at 1:05:17.82 in the men's time trial at the Beijing Olympics, 3:06 behind race winner Fabian Cancellara.\n\nZabriskie won stage 6, the Individual Time Trial in the Tour of California. Zabriskie was also key to 's successes in the 2011 Tour de France. Garmin-Cervélo win in the second stage team time trial propelled team leader Thor Hushovd into the yellow jersey. Thor stayed in the yellow jersey until stage 9, the stage Zabriskie seriously injured his wrist in a crash during a descent that also caused the withdrawal of Alexander Vinokourov, Jurgen van den Broeck and Frederik Willems.\n\nIn 2005, Zabriskie married Randi Reich, a 2005 University of California at Berkeley alumna. In February 2009, thieves entered Zabriskie's home while he was away competing in the Tour of California and stole thousands of dollars worth of racing equipment and Olympic memorabilia and his Marvel action figure collection. Three men were charged in connection with the burglary. David Zabriskie confirmed at the end of the 2010 cycling season that he is following a vegan based diet, albeit with the addition of salmon.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2013 Giro di Lombardia Zabriskie announced his retirement after 13 years as a professional cyclist.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160741", "title": "Mary Gaitskill", "text": "Mary Gaitskill\n\nMary Gaitskill (born November 11, 1954) is an American novelist, essayist, and short story writer. Her work has appeared in \"The New Yorker\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Esquire\", \"The Best American Short Stories\" (1993, 2006, 2012), and \"The O. Henry Prize Stories\" (1998, 2008).\n\nGaitskill was born in Lexington, Kentucky. She has lived in New York City, Toronto, San Francisco, Marin County and Pennsylvania, as well as attending the University of Michigan, where she earned her B.A. in 1981 and won a Hopwood Award. She sold flowers in San Francisco as a teenage runaway. In a conversation with novelist and short story writer Matthew Sharpe for \"BOMB Magazine\", Gaitskill said she chose to become a writer at age 18 because she was \"indignant about things—it was the typical teenage sense of 'things are wrong in the world and I must say something.'\" Gaitskill has also recounted (in her essay \"Revelation\") becoming a born-again Christian at age 21 but lapsing after six months.\n\nShe married the writer Peter Trachtenberg in 2001. They divorced in 2010.\n\nGaitskill has taught at UC Berkeley, the University of Houston, New York University, The New School, Brown University, in the MFA program at Temple University and Syracuse University. She was the Writer-In-Residence at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. As of 2020, Gaitskill is a visiting professor of literature at Claremont McKenna College.\n\nGaitskill attempted to find a publisher for four years before her first book, the short story collection \"Bad Behavior,\" was published in 1988. The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. \"Secretary\" is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, sex work, sadomasochism, drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. \"A Romantic Weekend\" and \"Secretary\" both explore themes of BDSM and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story \"Connection\" is about a female friendship.\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as prostitution, addiction, and sado-masochism. Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl. She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for \"Harper's\".\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in \"Harper's\" also addresses feminist debates about date rape, victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" \n\nThe film \"Secretary\" (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in \"Bad Behavior\", although the two have little in common. She characterized the film as \"the \"Pretty Woman\" version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"\n\nThe novel \"Two Girls, Fat and Thin\" follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat). Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of Objectivism and Ayn Rand). When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an exposé of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women. In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\nThe novel \"The Mare\", published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through The Fresh Air Fund. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for \"Because They Wanted To\" in 1998. \"Veronica\" (2005) was a National Book Award nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year. The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts AIDS. Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001. Writing of \"Veronica\" and Gaitskill's career in \"Harper's Magazine\" in March 2006, Wyatt Mason said:\n\nGaitskill's favorite writers have changed over time, as she noted in a 2005 interview, but one constant is the author Vladimir Nabokov, whose \"Lolita\" \"will be on my ten favorites list until the end of my life.\" Another consistently named influence is Flannery O'Connor. Despite her well-known S/M themes, Gaitskill does not appear to consider the Marquis de Sade himself an influence, or at least not a literary one: \"I don't think much of Sade as a writer, although I enjoyed beating off to him as a child.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Located in the heart of Lower Myanmar, the division is bordered by Bago Region to the north and east, the Gulf of Martaban to the south, and Ayeyarwady Region to the west. Yangon Region is dominated by its capital city of Yangon, the former national capital and the largest city in the country. Other important cities are Thanlyin and Twante. The division is the most developed region of the country and the main international gateway. The division measures .\n\nThe region was historically populated by the Mon. Politically, the area was controlled by Mon kingdoms prior to 1057, and after 1057, with few exceptions, by Burman kingdoms from the north. The control of the region reverted to Pegu-based Mon kingdoms in the 13th to 16th centuries (1287–1539) and briefly in the 18th century (1740-57). The Portuguese were in control of Thanlyin (Syriam) and the surrounding area from 1599 to 1613.\n\nFor centuries, Thanlyin was the most important port city in Lower Myanmar until the mid-18th century when King Alaungpaya chose to enlarge a small village across the river near the great Shwedagon Pagoda named Dagon.\n\nThe British first captured Yangon in the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-26) but returned it Burmese administration after the war. The British seized Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. Yangon was the capital of British Burma and Hanthawaddy Province, which covered today's Yangon and Bago divisions. The British brought in many Indians to serve as workers and civil servants. By the 1930s, the Indians made up half of Yangon city, and only one-third was Burmese. \n\nBetween World War I and World War II, Yangon was the center of Burmese nationalist movement. Many future Burmese political figures such as Aung San, U Nu, U Thant and Ne Win were all one-time Rangoon University students. Yangon Region was under Japanese occupation between April 1942 and May 1945.\n\nAfter Myanmar gained independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948, the Hanthawaddy Province was renamed Pegu (Bago) Division, with Yangon as its capital. In 1964, Rangoon Division was split from Pegu Division. The capital of Pegu Division was changed from Rangoon to Pegu. In June 1974, Hanthawaddy (Hongsavatoi) and Hmawbi townships were transferred from Pegu Division to Rangoon Division.\n\nPost-war Yangon grew tremendously. Successive Burmese governments built satellite towns near Yangon. Today, Yangon Region is essentially the Greater Yangon metropolitan area surrounded by a hollow rural hinterland.\n\nYangon Region consists of 4 districts and 44 townships. Of the 44, the city of Yangon now encompasses 33 townships.\n\nYangon Region Government\n\nYangon Region High Court \n\nThe ethnic Burmese makes up the majority of the population. The division is also home to a large number of Chinese and South Asians. The majority of the inhabitants are Theravada Buddhists, followed by Muslims, Christians and Hindus. According to 2014 census report, the population of Yangon region is 7.36 million. Burmese is the primary language used by Burmese of all ethnic backgrounds. English is the main second language among the urban elite of Yangon.\n\nYangon Region is the most developed region in the country. According to the government's official statistics for FY 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93 trillion kyat, or 23% of the national GDP. Greater Yangon is Lower Myanmar’s main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic food stuffs to used cars. Bayinnaung Market is the largest wholesale center in the country for rice, beans and pulses, and other agricultural commodities. Much of the country’s legal imports and exports go through Thanlyin's Thilawa port, the largest and busiest port in Myanmar. At least 14 light industrial zones ring Yangon, employing thousands of workers. Outside Greater Yangon, rice farming remains predominant. Other important crops include jute, pulses, rubber, sugarcane, and groundnut.\n\nYangon Region has the best transportation infrastructure in the country. All transport to and from the rest of the country (and the world) goes through Yangon. Five \"highways\" link Yangon to the rest of the country. (To be sure, the definition of highway is loosely used. Most highways are no more than two lane roads.) Yangon International Airport is the main international gateway of the country. Yangon Central Railway Station is a major hub of the Myanmar Railways system. Twante Canal, which links Yangon to Ayeyarwaddy Region, is also widely used for both transport and commerce.\n\nAs motor transportation is highly expensive for most people, buses are the main mode of transportation within the division or regions nearby. In January 2008, Yangon Region had nearly 182,000 motor vehicles, 17.7% of the country's total.\n\nAlthough the city of Yangon has the best education facilities in the country, the educational facilities and opportunities available in the rest of Yangon Region are extremely poor. Many students in rural and poor districts do not finish middle school. According to official statistics, only about 23% of primary school students make it to high school. Most students are enrolled in the public school system. Private schools, which cost at least $8,000 a year in tuition per student, are strictly the preserve of the elite.\n\nNearly all of the division's universities are in Greater Yangon. Dagon University in North Dagon and the University of East Yangon in Thanlyin are among the largest undergraduate universities in the country. Yangon's University of Medicine 1, Yangon, University of Medicine 2, Yangon, Yangon Technological University, University of Computer Studies, Yangon and Thanlyin's Myanmar Maritime University are among the most selective universities in Myanmar.\n\nThe University of West Yangon in Htantabin and the Officers Training School in Hmawbi are two major institutions of higher education outside Greater Yangon.\n\nThe general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Still, Yangon Region has the best medical facilities and personnel available in the country. The following is a summary of the public health system in the division, in the fiscal year 2002-2003.\n\n"}

It is the primary airport in the Las Vegas area for general aviation and scenic tours, allowing McCarran International Airport to focus on airline flights. North Las Vegas offered limited regional airline service in the past. Many helicopter operators including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department use the airport.\n\nThe airport is certificated under 14 CFR Part 139.\n\nThe airport opened on December 7, 1941, as Sky Haven Airport. Given the significance of the date, only one of the three founders, Florence Murphy, remained to run the airport.\n\nSky Rider Motel opened in the early 1960s during an expansion project at the airport, featuring a swimming pool shaped like an airplane.\n\nIn 1968 Hughes Tool Company purchased the airport, then called North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\nNorth Las Vegas Airport covers at an elevation of .

For the year of 2007, North Las Vegas ranked #2 in airports with most runway incursions.\n\nOn August 30, 1978, Las Vegas Airlines Flight 44, a Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (N44LV), crashed in VFR conditions shortly after takeoff from runway 25. Flight 44 was a charter flight from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Santa Ana, California, with nine Australian tourists and a pilot on board. After liftoff following a longer-than-normal ground roll, the aircraft pitched nose up, climbed steeply to about 400 ft above the ground, stalled, reversed course, and crashed 1,150 ft beyond and 650 ft to the right of the runway. All persons on board the aircraft were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was a backed out elevator down-stop bolt that limited down elevator travel and made it impossible for the pilot to prevent a pitchup and stall after takeoff. There was no fire.\n\nOn January 2, 2013, a twin-engine Piper Aerostar crashed and burst into flames at North Las Vegas Airport after a hard landing. The two occupants escaped uninjured.\n\n"}

The existing rivers and creeks serve as potential for effective drainage, more especially the Catanauan River. Catanuan has slopes ranging from 0–13% to 15% and above. The most elevated portion is at barangay San Jose which has a slope of 60% and greater. Susceptibility to erosion is directly proportional to the slope percentage and degree of susceptibility.\n\nCatanauan is politically subdivided into 46 barangays.\nCatanauan being a first class municipality, boast of several commercial establishments including several inns, restaurants and a major fast food chain. One of the major agricultural trades by the populace is copra buying and selling. While infrastructure is sufficient, the public cemetery appears to be already at full capacity. Primary and Secondary level education is being catered by 1 public school and 1 private school. Tertiary education is being catered by the 2 colleges.\n\nThe existence of Catanauan as a pueblo (town) was first recorded in the map of Father Pedro Murillo dated on 1734. The petition dated 1685 of Bishop Andres Gonzales of Nueva Caceres, now known as Naga City in the Bicol Region, requesting the king of Spain to have Masbater and the Pueblo of Catanauan assigned to Recollect Order was reflective of the early creation of Catanauan. The recognized foundation date of the Municipality was January 20, 1686.\n\nIn the late 18th and 19th century, there were frequent Moro raids. These occurrences prompted the people to construct two small stone forts or watch towers (\"magkatanawan\") mounted with artillery. Santa Maria watch tower was located at Lot 21 psc-2 near the present wharf is located. Castillo watch tower stood at the intersection of present Rizal and Boncan Street. Hence, the name Catanauan was so derived.\n\n\nCatanauan is one of the towns in Bondoc Peninsula where members of the NPA are active. Last February 21, 2017, an attempt to set a pay-loader on fire at a batching plant in barangay Cutcutan was thwarted thanks to the immediate response of the local police, the army and firemen. Last June 18, 2017, 2 soldiers were hurt and 2 generator sets were burned at an encounter with the rebels at a Globe cell site tower in barangay Ajos.\n\nDecember 8 - immaculate conception church town fiesta\n\n\"Boling-Boling\" is an old age practice particular to Catanauanins, which is celebrated annually starting on the Sunday and ends on Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday and signals the start of the Lenten Season. Participants roam around the town garbed in any costume they may fancy. Most of them wear colourful clown-like clothes while others imitate anybody whom they despise and make fun of them. It is the Pinoy version of carnival. No one can tell exactly when and how this practice started, not even the oldest resident of this town located at the heart of Bondoc Peninsula. Senior women wearing brightly coloured dresses and hats with flowers sing and dance from one house to another to solicit cash donations, half of which is given to the local Parish Church for its expenses during the Lenten Season activities and the other half for their own group’s civic projects. \"Boling-Boling\" comes from the Visayan word \"Boling\", which means \"dirt\". This reminds us that we are sinners and that we need to repent, do some spiritual cleansing and get ourselves ready for the Lenten Season. In earlier times, Catanauanins had a grandiose merry-making during the Boling-Boling as, starting the following day, which is Ash Wednesday, they will keep silent suspending all merry-makings until the Black Saturday in reverence to the Lenten Season. Some men skimpily clad in their undergarments put on mud or grease with charcoal all over their bodies and roam around the town trying to scare young women and children for fun.\n\nCatanauan, Quezon is a coastal third-class municipality of the western Bondoc Peninsula, with the municipality of Mulanay on its south and southeast. It has coordinates of 13° 35' 30\" N, 122° 19' 30\" E, and its town has a total land area of 266 kilometers. Catanauan has a population of 57, 736 people in 11, 283 households. (2000 Philippine Census). The town proper faces Mompog pass and Marinduque Island, and borders the municipality of General Luna in the north-west, the municipality of Buenavista in the north-east.\n\nThe archaeological potential of Catanauan was brought to light in 2006 when Mr. Deo Cuerdo, citizen and cultural advocate of the municipality, reported to the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies Program (UP-ASP) and the National Museum, cases of accidentally uncovered archaeological materials due to development projects, earthmoving activities, and even illegal diggings. The reported archaeological materials were mostly of jar burials. UP-ASP conducted a preliminary archaeological survey in 2008, and discovered three sites. Since then, there have been a total of 8 excavation seasons in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and most recently in January 2017.\n\nIn the Catanauan excavations, there were 4 main sites; Napa site locality 1, Napa site locality 4, Campo site, and Comiso site. Each contain their own distinct artifacts and discoveries.\n\nNapa Site (Code IV-2008-Q5) was the primary excavation site, containing multiple trenches along with 3 main assemblages; SM1, SM2, and SM3, or “Stone Markers”. This is where most jar burials and tools were found.\n\nLocality 4 is a second location close to locality 1 with four active trenches containing multiple jar burials in very tight clusters, along with coral markers and lids scattered throughout.\n\nThis location, initially a 20th-century cemetery, was excavated with the hopes of discovering similar human remains, but unidentified markers were discovered, which purpose has not yet been determined.\n\nThis survey site was one of the earliest to be excavated and surveyed. Located in Barangay Matandang Sabang Kanluran, this site was heavily stirred up and roiled by quarrying sand. It was later discovered that this was once also another burial site. Its similarities though to other burial sites remain unclear.\n\nCatanauan, Quezon has been known for the numerous jar burials that have been recovered there. Even before the recent excavations in the site, locals have already reported that some jar burials in the site were uncovered through development projects, and that they were able to dig up a series of jar burials with human remains. As the site is very archaeologically rich, the Archaeological Studies Program of the University of the Philippines, Diliman and the Australia National University have been conducting research and excavations in Catanauan through the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project since 2008.\n\nThe Napa site in Barangay Tuhian, Catanauan is a very significant place for archaeological research. Most of the jar burials found in Catanauan were recovered from this site. In the 2008 excavation, a lot of jar burials with their human remains were found in Locality 1, Napa site, specifically in trenches 4 and 6. The jars found were mostly earthenware. Different types of coral slabs and rocks served as jar covers. The jars were used for primary and secondary burials. Paz, et al. (2008) inferred that people “went back to uncover the jars, take out the human remains in the jars, and when events dictated, a new body was placed in the old jar”. Some excavated jars were also used for child burials. Aside from human bones, different-colored glass beads, gastropods and fragments of metal were found inside the jars. Boat-shaped burial markers were also found in the site.\n\nIn 2010, more jar burials have been recovered as additional trenches were opened. One very distinct jar was the jar found in Trench 13 because of its unique features. It was the only jar from the site which had earthenware as its cover (Paz, et al., 2010). It was oval-shaped and neonate remains were found inside it. Paz, et al. (2010) stated that as of 2010, there are 28 definite jar burials for the Napa site and they are at least a thousand years old.\n\nComiso Property site is another jar burial site in Catanauan. It is less than 10 km away from the Napa site. Burial jar sherds and fragments of human remains were found on the surface of the site (Paz, et al., 2010). The jar burials were found under shell middens. However, unlike the jars in Napa site, there were no Chinese glass beads found in the Comiso site. This may mean that the Comiso site is older than the Napa site (Paz, et al., 2011).\n\nVarious artifacts have been excavated from Catanauan sites. These artifacts consists of burial jars, Earthenware sherds, skeletal remains, and shell middens.\n\nIn 2006, a sand quarry accidentally uncovered at least 5 jar burials containing human skeletal remains in Kanlagkit, Barangay Matandang Sabang Kanluran. At least three sandpits were left partially open, with the backfill containing earthenware sherds and skeletal fragments (mostly long bone).\n\nDuring the 2008 excavation a shell midden was exposed. The area where local inhabitants dug up burial jars with human remains was abundant in limestone slab fragments, earthenware sherds, and human skeletal fragments. Below the discovered shell midden were a few shells and pottery. Even below that, two small, well fired reddish earthenware pot sherds were found. Some glass beads were also found. A child (neonate) burial was found inside a small earthenware pot 40 cm in diameter, with yellow glass beads buried along with it. Another burial (a female, from studying the pelvic bone) was discovered, and this had sherds from a small pot and a cylindrical artifact.\n\nTo facilitate several forms of public archaeology and heritage work in the duration of the field season in the Napa site, crew members were oriented to always explain the significance of the archaeological project, at a community level and at larger scale of Philippine culture, to the community members and walk-in groups observing the excavation. The team also held day trips for student coming from different schools like San Isidro National High School - Catanauan, Tayuman National High School, Busdak National High School and ASTI College, mostly coming from near cities and/or provinces. In addition, they updated the tarpaulin signage at the Locality 1 site, Napa site, that explains the study of archaeology and highlights of the findings so far.\n\nThe team also actively participated in the fiesta celebrations of Tuhian. As part of the celebration, the team is given a chance to explain to the public community what the project is all about. At the end of the season, the team mounted and left a three-panel exhibit of the results from the first season of excavation (2008). The exhibit explained what archaeology is, the findings and result of the project, and its significance to Philippine history and heritage. They made the exhibit movable so they can move it due to events and gatherings in the barangay.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2160773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160773", "title": "Columbia Pacific University", "text": "Columbia Pacific University\n\nColumbia Pacific University (CPU) was an unaccredited nontraditional distance learning school in California. It was founded in 1978 by Richard Crews, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, and Lester Carr, a former president of Lewis University, and operated with state approval. Distance learning and education authority John Bear gave \"high marks\" to the school in his 1982 \"Bears' Guide to Non-Traditional College Degrees, 8th edition\".\n\nCPU was closed by California court order in 2000.\n\nCPU alumni acquired all rights to the CPU name and registered a \"Columbia Pacific University\", a non-profit organization in Delaware. Until 2007, the CPU Press continued its publication program.\n\nIn 1983, after four years of operating under a basic authorization licensing, CPU's programs in administration and management received institutional approval from the California Department of Education Private Postsecondary Education Division. On June 2, 1986, the California Department of Education granted all of CPU's programs full institutional approval for a three-year period, ruling that CPU's curricula met \"California Education Code\" Section 94310(b)'s statutory requirement of being \"consistent in quality with curricula offered by appropriate established accredited institutions which are recognized by the United States Department of Education.\"\n\nCalifornia passed the Private Postsecondary Education Act, changing state regulations for approved schools in 1989. This law established the Council for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (CPPVE) as the single State agency responsible for reviewing and approving private postsecondary institutions in California. Legislation in 1997 providing \"authorization for continuation of the Reform Act was vetoed due to political pressures and concerns about the level of fees, the way in which Council staff was carrying out its\nresponsibilities, and the absence of an administrative appeals\" process. In a meeting of the ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION the veto of CPPVE was said to be caused by unfairly high fees charged to smaller institutions and \"vindictiveness by Council staff\" to institutions that didn't comply. With new legislation in 1997 \"the Legislature created the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education\" within the Department of Consumer Affairs, and transferred \"responsibility for administration of the Reform Act from the Council to the Bureau\" placing CPU under the authority of the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE). Staffing and funding of the Bureau was transitioned over a period of years such that the Council continued to operate until 2005 and BPPVE ceased operation in 2007 due to a sunset clause in the law. California Department of Education Private Postsecondary Education Division also ceased operation in 2007. Institutions that were in good standing with BPPVE were allowed to continue operation under existing approvals that were valid for two years, until the (BPPE) \"Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education came into existence on January 1, 2010, following passage of Assembly Bill 48, known as the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009\" (California Education Code, Title 3, Division 10, Part 59, Chapter 8).\n\nThe BPPVE was not intended to be a recognized accreditor, nor did its approval serve as a substitute for educational accreditation. California laws were in transition for several years leaving the future of unaccredited institutions in doubt. Under BPPE both accredited and non-accredited institutions may apply for approval to operate in California. Under BPPVE state approval was, however, a prerequisite in order for a private institution to become accredited. BPPVE informational materials stated \"Approval is not the same as accreditation.\"\n\nIn 1994 Marin County inspectors discovered eight permitless dormitories on CPU founder Les Carr's property. Marin County officials cited Carr for \"multiple zoning, safety, and health violations\". Carr was forced to remove the dormitories, as well as to remove references to the property as \"a retreat center on a beautiful ranch in northern Marin county\" in CPU's promotional literature.\n\nAn August 1995 site visit committee of the Council for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education found that CPU had not met the new regulations. It failed the 1995 visit on the basis of 88 points. The council's review of CPU listed numerous violations of academic standards, including:\n\nOn November 15, 1995, CPU submitted a response challenging the CPPVE findings. CPU's response argued that the CPPVE's August report \"is grossly in error in most details, as documented in the 86 errors of fact enumerated\", and therefore argued that the CPPVE report was \"utterly unreliable as an objective and thorough evaluation of CPU\".\n\nCPU's response argued that the CPPVE Visiting Committee's review of CPU dissertations was based on superficial judgments. In \"Error of Fact No. 27\", for example, CPU's response says that the complaint about the lack of \"evidence of competency in statistical research\" was erroneous because \"many dissertations do not require statistical analysis\". In \"Error of Fact No. 28\" and \"Error of Fact No. 31\", regarding CPPVE's finding that a Ph.D. dissertation was submitted in Spanish and reviewed by faculty who could not speak the language, CPU responded that the indicated student \"provided an authenticated English translation\" and had been working with a Spanish-fluent mentor who resided in Venezuela.\n\nCPPVE director Kenneth Miller issued CPU a Denial of Application for Approval in December 1995.\n\nCPU administrators appealed the decision to close the school, but an administrative court judge ruled against the appeal on June 10, 1997. Among other items, the administrative appeals judge found that CPU:\n\nIn the state's 1997 lawsuit to compel CPU to close, California Deputy Attorney General Asher Rubin called the correspondence school \"a diploma mill which has been preying on California consumers for too many years\" and \"a consumer fraud, a complete scam\". The suit also referred to Columbia Pacific University as a \"phony operation\" offering \"totally worthless [degrees]...to enrich its unprincipled promoters\".\n\nOn December 2, 1999, the Marin County Superior Court ordered the school be shut down, also levying $10,000 in fines against CPU for its \"deceptive and unfair practices\" in operating without authorization and failing to disclose its status to prospective students during the appeals process. Judge Lynn Duryee noted in her decision that \"The decision is not whether or not the students are dissatisfied... I mean that is not the test. It's like saying, you know, that prostitution should not be illegal because the customers are satisfied. It's not the test.\"\n\nThis appeal was lost in 2000 and CPU was ordered to close. The Supreme Court of California upheld the denial of CPU's approval to operate.\n\nSoon after CPU's closure in California, founder Les Carr relocated to Missoula, Montana and formed \"Columbia Commonwealth University\" (CCWU). Columbia Commonwealth University obtained approval from the Republic of Malawi to operate as an accredited educational institution in the African nation. In 2001 CCWU moved to Jackson, Wyoming, and was based in Rock Springs, Wyoming until 2007; CCWU continues to operate in Malawi. CPU founder Les Carr still serves as chairman of the board of trustees of CCWU.\n\nCalifornia recognizes CPU degrees earned before June 25, 1997, as \"legally valid\" for use in the state. CPU degrees earned on or after June 25, 1997, are \"not legally valid\" for use in California.\n\nMichigan \"Please note that individual degree programs that have not been accredited by\nthe recognized programmatic accrediting body might not be accepted.\"\n\nTexas \"Texas has recognized CPU degrees recognized by California as legally valid\"\n"}

The story is based on a 1947 children's book of the same name by Charles Tazewell and was a project for the new generation of Disney animators including Don Bluth, Jerry Rees, Henry Selick, Gary Goldman, and John Pomeroy.\n\nThe story tells of a young boy, outside Nazareth, who must part with his best friend, an old donkey named Small One. He brings it to market, but no one is in need of a \"scrawny donkey\", except for a tanner.\n\nIn the Galilean countryside near the city of Nazareth, a young boy and his father own four donkeys. Three of these donkeys are young and strong. The fourth donkey, Small One, is old and weak, but the boy loves him anyway. Every day, the boy and the donkey play together before they go to work, helping the boy's father to collect wood.\n\nThe boy and his father take the donkeys to work one morning, as they always do. Many times, the boy loads Small One with small sticks, since Small One can't carry heavy loads any more. Small One even has trouble carrying stacks of small sticks and the boy helps to carry them for him.\n\nThat evening, the boy's father tells the boy that he has to sell Small One because he can no longer do enough work to cover the cost of his care. Devastated, but understanding, the boy asks if he can be the one to sell his best friend. The father agrees and tells him that he has to sell him for one piece of silver. That night, the boy comforts Small One and promises to find him a gentle and loving master.\n\nThe next morning, the boy takes Small One to the market. Their task begins by being tricked into a haunting visit to the local tanner by a guard at the city gates. Terrified, they quickly run out of the shop once they realize he only wants the donkey's hide. As they wander the streets looking for a buyer, they encounter several townspeople, shop owners, and merchants, none of whom want to buy.\n\nIn a final attempt to find a buyer, the boy leads Small One onto the stage at a horse auction. The auctioneer has no interest in selling a \"scrawny donkey,\" which causes the boy to insist that Small One is \"good enough to be in a king's stable.\" This prompts the auctioneer to laugh and poke fun, sarcastically playing along to embarrass them and rouse the crowd. When he attempts to sit on Small One, he shoves the boy out of the way. Upon seeing this, Small One rouses the strength to buck and kick the auctioneer off him, sending him crashing into the stage and knocking it over. Afraid and ashamed, the boy and Small One run around a corner to escape the unruly auctioneer.\n\nAs dusk falls on the city, the pair have run out of options, and sit on a street corner weeping, without hope. In this bleak moment, a kind man comes up to the boy and asks if Small One is for sale. The man needs a gentle donkey to carry his wife to Bethlehem, insists he will take good care of him, and offers one piece of silver. The boy accepts, says goodbye to Small One, and watches as the couple and Small One leave on their journey as a bright star appears in the sky.\n\n\n\nBy the early 1970s, several of Disney's senior animators had either died or retired, but the continuous success of their animated features convinced studio executives that the animation department was still lucrative but in desperate need for new talent. Veteran animator Eric Larson was selected to head the training program, in which he selected and trained graduates from colleges and art schools across the United States. Eventually, twenty-five new artists were hired from 1970 to 1977.\n\nThe idea for \"The Small One\" originated from story trainee Pete Young who found the book among optioned properties at the studio library. He developed the initial storyboards at home, and pitched it to Ron Miller who claimed it to be a story with \"heart\". To help polish the storyboards, Miller brought on veteran storyboard artist Vance Gerry to collaborate with Young. Larson had assumed he would be directing the film and brought Burny Mattinson to help re-board the story, as well as veteran animator Cliff Nordberg to help assist on the animation. According to Mattinson, the team left on Friday for the weekend, and returned on Monday to have their work tossed out because studio management had decided to give the project to Don Bluth to direct. Then-animator Betsy Baytos claimed Larson, in reaction to the news, \"just shook his head and knew that he wasn't being appreciated. He felt the old days were gone.\" In retrospect, Bluth stated, \"\"Small One\" was something I directed to get the crew busy until \"Pete's Dragon\"...[Larson] might have [been involved] in the storyboard area. [But he] didn't get to direction. I think he elected to [teach].\" Given the allotted production budget, Bluth composed two songs himself with a third song composed by assistant director Richard Rich, and recycled animation of Mowgli from \"The Jungle Book\" (1967).\n\n\nOn September 27, 2005, Disney released \"The Small One\" for the first time on Region 1 DVD as part of \"\". This DVD also featured \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" (1983) and \"Pluto's Christmas Tree\" (1952). The short is edited in two places:\n\n\nThis short is also featured on the DVD \"Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films: Volume 7: Mickey's Christmas Carol\" released on September 29, 2009.\nIt was also released on Region 2 on the DVD \"Walt Disney Presents Countdown to Christmas\".\n\nThe title was also made available for streaming and download in the digital format.\n\n\n"}

It is about north of the village of Wool and west of the major port of Poole. The collection traces the history of the tank. With almost 300 vehicles on exhibition from 26 countries it is the largest collection of tanks and the third largest collection of armoured vehicles in the world. It includes Tiger 131, the only working example of a German Tiger I tank, and a British First World War Mark I, the world's oldest surviving combat tank.

Accordingly a shed was established to house the collection but was not opened to the general public until 1947.\n\nGeorge Forty, who was appointed Director of the Museum in 1982, expanded and modernized the collection. He retired in 1993 after which he received an OBE. The museum established its own YouTube channel to teach about the tanks in January 2010.

During Henry V's reign he became Archdeacon of Salisbury, but by early 1421 had been appointed King's Secretary, and is recorded as attending Privy Council meetings.

The 29th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 9, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker, along with Nancy M. Pimental, and directed by Eric Stough.\n\nIn the episode, the boys go to Cartman's grandma's house in Nebraska for the holidays, but Stan was told by his parents that he cannot go for their permission. Stan challenges their authority and goes anyway. Meanwhile, Cartman's Uncle Howard and his friend, Charlie Manson, bust out of prison and cause mayhem and mischief.\n\nStan asks his parents for permission to see Cartman's grandmother in Nebraska for the holidays, but they refused because this place is far away from South Park. Feeling disillusioned with the idea of family, he runs off to Cartman's house just in time to join the other boys. During the drive to Nebraska, they see a sign for an appearance of Mr. Hankey at a mall. When they finally arrive, Cartman's relatives are there, all of whom share Cartman's mannerisms. At dinner, they meet Cartman's Uncle Howard, live via satellite from the state prison. Later that night, the boys hear someone breaking into the house and discover that it is Uncle Howard and another inmate, Charlie Manson.\n\nThe boys want to go to the mall to see Mr. Hankey, but no one in the family will take them, and Cartman is asked to keep an eye on his cousin, Elvin. Manson offers to take the boys to the mall. Kyle and Stan meet a human-sized Mr. Hankey, whom Kyle exposes as a fake, causing a riot. The boys and Manson escape from the mall, but when the riot police recognize Manson, they get into a televised high speed chase with the police.\n\nManson arrives at the Cartman household, and, together with Uncle Howard, proceeds to hold everyone hostage. Stan's parents arrive and punishes him for disobeying their order to not go to Cartman's grandmother in Nebraska without their permission. Stan asks to make an escape with Uncle Howard and Manson but Manson talks to him about the meaning of family, which makes him change his mind. Manson and Uncle Howard surrender and sing a holiday-special style song. Stan's parents agree that they were unreasonable when denying him a Christmas with his friends. Later, as Manson goes to sleep in prison, Stan, Kyle, and all of the Cartmans appear to sing \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" to Manson.\n\nAll 18 episodes of the second season, including \"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!\", were released on a DVD box set on June 3, 2003.\n\n"}

It climbs tree trunks, or forms dense tangles on the forest floor. Its stems and leaves are a dominant feature in many areas of New Zealand forest, the stems eventually reaching up to 30 m long. The leaves are long and slender, 60–90 cm long and 2-2.5 cm broad.\n\nKiekie is found in forests throughout the North Island. In the South Island, kiekie is more common in higher rainfall areas, reaching its southern limit near the Clarence river in the east and in Fiordland in the west.\n\nIn 1973, B.C. Stone argued that \"F. banksii\" should be regarded as a subspecies of \"F. baueriana\" of Norfolk Island (Stone 1973). Subsequent to this, de Lange et al. (2005:591-592), countered Stone's arguments and retained \"F. banksii\" as a distinct species because of significant differences from \"F. baueriana\", including over all growth habit, phyllotaxis, leaf width, vein tessellation, and bract colour (salmon pink to orange in \"F. baueriana\", white to purplish in \"F. banksii\").\n\nThe sweet-tasting fruits and the succulent flower bracts (tāwhara) were a delicacy of the Māori. These were often gathered by using a forked stick. The leaves widely for plaiting and weaving, although the broader leaves of New Zealand flax were preferred because they provided more material. Items woven included mats and temporary baskets for holding food. The aerial roots were gathered to use as a binding material for implements and for making fish traps and sandals.\n\n\n"}

It was the capital of the kingdom led by the Pandavas in the \"Mahabharata\" epic. Under the Pali form of its name, Indapatta, it is also mentioned in Buddhist texts as the capital of the Kuru mahajanapada. It is often thought to have been located in the region of present-day New Delhi, particularly the Old Fort (Purana Qila), although this has not been conclusively confirmed. The city is sometimes also known as \"Khandavaprastha\" or \"Khandava Forest\", the name of a forest region on the banks of Yamuna river which (according to the \"Mahabharata\") had been cleared by Krishna and Arjun to build the city.\n\nIndraprastha is referenced in the \"Mahabharata\", a Sanskrit Indian text compiled over a period approximately between 400 BCE and 400 CE. The \"Mahabharata\" records Indraprastha as being home to the Pandavas, whose wars with the Kauravas it describes. The location of Indraprastha is uncertain but Purana Qila in present-day New Delhi is frequently cited and has been noted as such in texts as old as the 14th-century CE. The modern form of the name, Inderpat, continued to be applied to the Purana Qila area into the early 20th century; in a study of ancient Indian place-names, Michael Witzel considers this to be one of many places from the Sanskrit Epics whose names have been retained into modern times, such as Kaushambi/Kosam.\n\nPurana Qila is certainly an ancient settlement but archaeological studies performed there since the 1950s have failed to reveal structures and artefacts that would confirm the architectural grandeur and rich lives in the period that the \"Mahabharata\" describes. The historian Upinder Singh notes that despite the academic debate, \"Ultimately, there is no way of conclusively proving or disproving whether the Pandavas or Kauravas ever lived ...\". However, it is possible that the main part of the ancient city has not been reached by excavations so far, but rather falls under the unexcavated area extending directly to the south of Purana Qila.\n\nIndraprastha is not only known from the \"Mahabharata.\" It is also mentioned as \"Indapatta\" or \"Indapattana\" in Pali-language Buddhist texts, where it is described as the capital of the Kuru Kingdom, situated on the Yamuna River. The Buddhist literature also mentions Hatthinipura (Hastinapura) and several smaller towns and villages of the Kuru kingdom. Indraprastha may have been known to the Greco-Roman world as well: it is thought to be mentioned in Ptolemy's \"Geography\" dating from the 2nd century CE as the city \"Indabara\", possibly derived from the Prakrit form \"Indabatta\", and which was probably in the vicinity of Delhi. Upinder Singh (2004) describes this equation of Indabara with Indraprastha as \"plausible\". Indraprastha is also named as a pratigana (district) of the Delhi region in a Sanskrit inscription dated to 1327 CE, discovered in Raisina area of New Delhi.\n\nD. C. Sircar, an epigraphist, believed Indraprastha was a significant city in the Mauryan period, based on analysis of a stone carving found in the Delhi area at Sriniwaspuri which records the reign of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Singh has cast doubt on this interpretation because the inscription does not actually refer to Indraprastha and although \"... a place of importance must certainly have been located in the vicinity of the rock edict, exactly which one it was and what it was known as, is uncertain.\" Similarly, remains, such as an iron pillar, that have been associated with Ashoka are not indubitably so: their composition is atypical and the inscriptions are vague.\n\nAs of 2014, the Archaeological Survey of India is continuing excavation in Purana Qila.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n"}

It was designed by Harry D Som and Helen W Som, principals of Som and Associates of San Francisco. (The building has been falsely attributed to the SOM design firm, which is inaccurate.) At 250 meters (819 ft) high, it was the tallest building outside North America when it opened in July 1985, and remains the tallest gold-clad structure in the world. It stood as South Korea's tallest building until the Hyperion Tower surpassed it in 2003, but remained the country's tallest commercial building until the Northeast Asia Trade Tower was topped-out in 2009.\n\nThe 63 Building was built as a landmark for the 1988 Summer Olympics. \"63\" is something of a misnomer since only 60 floors are above ground level. Floors 61-63 are restricted areas. The skyscraper is the headquarters of Korea Life Insurance, Industrial Bank of Korea Securities, and other major financial companies.\n\nThe design of the structure is based on the Hanja character for person or human being (人 or \"in\") in a subtle reference by the designers to the business of Daehan Life, the insurance company that constructed the building.\n\nThe 63 Building's construction broke ground in February 1980, at the height of South Korea's economic boom. It was built at a cost of 180 billion won, and construction was completed in May 1985. It was originally named the DLI 63 building, for Daehan Life Insurance. In 2000, Hanwha Group renamed the building 63 City and it became part of the group in 2002.\n\nThe 60th floor houses the world's highest art gallery and an observation deck known as the 63 Golden Tower, that allows visitors to see as far as Incheon on clear days. The 59th floor features international restaurants called \"Walking in the Cloud\", while the 58th floor houses family restaurants called \"Touch the Sky\". Observation elevators equipped with windows enable passengers to view the city on their way to/from the observation deck. In the evening, some elevators are available exclusively for couples. These are known as Love Elevators which give guests a one-minute ride. The lower floors house an indoor shopping mall with approximately 90 stores, an IMAX theater, and a large aquarium. A convention center and banquet hall are also housed within the building.\n\nThe 63 Building is featured in the 2000 computer game \"SimCity 3000 Unlimited\" and is featured on its cover.

It is administered by the National Park Service as part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War in 1865, the system of fortification (now known as Fort Circle Parks) which surrounded Washington, D.C. were dismantled. The lumber and other materials were sold at auctions and the land returned to pre-war owners. Fort Marcy is approximately south of the Potomac River on the south side of the Chain Bridge Road leading from Chain Bridge to Langley and McLean, Virginia. The perimeter of the fort is . When completed, the fort mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch (25 cm) mortar and two 24-pound (10 kg) Coehorn mortars. The batteries were aimed toward the south and west.\n\nThe hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort Baldy Smith, after General William Farrar Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. \nHis division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen.\nThe 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. \nA force of about 500 contrabands were also employed and the 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which incidentally are still in a very good state of preservation. \nThe site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.\n\nThe fort was not completed until the fall of 1862. \nIt is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and chief of staff to General George B. McClellan.\nDetachments of the 4th New York and 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania Infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. \nAn interesting incident of history is that the body of troops which afterwards became famous as the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861, and was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. \nThe 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the Battle of South Mountain.

Adam Elsheimer, also in Rome at the same time, was probably also an influence on them. Back in Utrecht, they painted mythological and religious history subjects and genre scenes, such as the card-players and gypsies that Caravaggio himself had abandoned in his later career. Utrecht was the most Catholic city in the United Provinces, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there. It had previously been the main centre, after Haarlem, of Northern Mannerist painting in the Netherlands. Abraham Bloemaert, who had been a leading figure in this movement, and taught the Honthursts and many other artists, also was receptive to the influence of his pupils, and changed his style many times before his death in 1651.\n\nThe brief flourishing of Utrecht Caravaggism ended around 1630. At that time, major artists had either died, as in the case of Baburen and ter Brugghen, or had changed style, like Honthorst's shift to portraiture and history scenes informed by the Flemish tendencies popularized by Peter Paul Rubens and his followers. They left a legacy, however, through their influence on Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and Gerrit Dou's \"niche paintings\" (a genre popularized by Honthorst).\n\nAlong with other Caravaggisti active in Italy and Woerden, they set the stage for later artists who worked in a Caravaggesque-inspired manner such as Georges de La Tour in Lorraine and Jan Janssens in Ghent.\n\n\n"}

The original line-up consisted of James Hearn (born 19 June 1976; vocals), Michael Harwood (born 12 December 1975; guitar), Jon O'Mahony (born 10 August 1973; drum) and Nick Keynes (born 3 May 1972; bass).\n\nAlthough sometimes mistakenly described as a manufactured boyband, Ultra was originally formed by James Hearn, James Rose, Michael Harwood and Jon O'Mahony who were schoolfriends from Buckinghamshire, England in the mid 1990s. After they left school they formed various bands, playing under names such as Stepping Stoned, Decade and Suburban Surfers. They eventually called themselves Ultra (named after the Depeche Mode album), and the following year Nick Keynes joined as bass player after being introduced by mutual friend Neil Cowley, who was the keyboard player for the Brand New Heavies.\n\nTheir demo tape eventually came to the attention of Ian Stanley (ex-Tears for Fears) and they were signed to Warner's EastWest label. In 1998 they released their first single, \"Say You Do\", written by Hearn, which reached #11 in the UK. Their next single, \"Say it Once\", charted at #16 in the UK. \"The Right Time\" was released in September 1998 and peaked at #28. Their fourth single for was \"Rescue Me\", which charted in the UK at No 8, the band's only British Top 10 single.\nIn February 1999, their debut album, \"Ultra\", entered the UK top 40 at #37.\n\nThe band were very popular with young female audiences, although they insisted that their success came primarily from their songs, not their looks. Ultra performed live and also supported a number of other pop acts including Irish boyband Boyzone in 1997, former Eternal member Louise Nurding for a performance at Wembley, and boyband 911. They were particularly popular in South East Asia and Italy, where they were mobbed by 3000 teenage girls at a record signing in Milan.\n\nIn 1999 they appeared in the Italian television where they performed a live version of \"Say it Once\" with Laura Pausini. The video of this performance can be found on YouTube.\n\nThe band lost their contract before recording their second album, as all of the record company A&R who signed them had left, and the new hierarchy passed on the opportunity to record a follow-up. The band split up in 2001 after James Hearn became disillusioned with the music business and decided to leave. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph James said of his time in Ultra: \n\"My music career was great fun and, as a bunch of guys who got together at Leeds University to give the musical bigtime a go, we had a good time\".\n\nIn 2005 the four original members of the band reunited to write and record their second studio album, \"The Sun Shines Brighter\", which also features songs written by former member Alistair Griffin, (who provides guest vocals on one of the tracks). Producer credits on the album include Ian Stanley (who produced their first album), Claudio Guidetti (Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti), and Ash Howes (Texas, Blue). This was released on 2 October 2006 on the Goldust label.\n\nThe other band members formed a new group with a number of different short term vocalists including Ryan Molloy. Singers Alistair Griffin and James Fox were both briefly members of the band at different times.\n\nIn 2002 several members of Ultra wrote and recorded a song to celebrate the World Cup, called \"England Crazy\", which they recorded as a one-off project as 'Rider' with Terry Venables. This project was re-signed to their old record label East West, but only reached number 46 in the UK chart due to a lacklustre campaign from the label.

It is situated to the east of Thirlmere and to the west of Glenridding valley. This places White Side in the Helvellyn range of the Eastern Fells, with Raise to the north and Helvellyn Lower Man to the south, both of which are of greater height.\n\nStrictly the name White Side refers to the western slope of a nameless summit. However it is often applied to the whole fell for convenience as was done by Alfred Wainwright. He gave White Side the status of a separate fell, a position followed by other guidebook writers. Wainwright suggested that the fell name could have come from the quartz found on the western slope.\n\nThe western and eastern faces of White Side are quite different in appearance. The eastern face is predominantly crag and scree falling abruptly to Keppel and Brown Coves. In contrast the western face falls gently to Thirlmere, the upper parts being mainly grass. The lower parts do provide some rock, such as Brown Crag, but these are generally outcrops rather than true crags.\n\nA great steep-sided hollow is gouged out of the eastern face, just north of the summit. This is the corrie of Kepple Cove, backed by Red Screes. Kepple Cove once contained an artificial tarn, although today the bed is merely marshy except after heavy rain. The water from the tarn was used in a hydroelectric scheme to drive electric winding gear at Greenside Mine. Commissioned in 1891, this was the first such system in the country. It continued in use until the night of 29 October 1927 when the Kepple Cove dam burst during a heavy storm, leaving an wide gap in the earthworks. The resulting wave passed down the valley and through Glenridding village, flooding buildings and causing extensive damage. The breached dam can still be seen today.\n\nSouth of Kepple Cove, between the southern ridge of White Side and Catstye Cam is Brown Cove. This also held an artificial tarn, but this is now reduced to a couple of small pools widening the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of luxuriant turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. There are also the remains of a level driven into the headwall of Brown Cove, a stone arched entrance leading to an tunnel. Water from Brown and Kepple Coves unites with the outflow of Helvellyn's Red Tarn to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater.\n\nThe western slopes of White Side are bounded by Helvellyn and Brund Gills, both of which originally flowed north to the Vale of St John. With the construction of the Thirlmere reservoir scheme in 1884 these streams were diverted to feed the lake a cutting being made through the low ridge which runs parallel to the shore.\n\nThe summit bears a small cairn in a sea of grass with the main ridge path crossing the highest point. Other than north and south where higher fells intervene, the view is good. The subsidiary top of Brown Crag (2,000 ft) on the western face also provides fine views of Skiddaw and The Dodds.\n\nAscents from the west begin at Swirls or Thirlspot. The Old Pony or White Stones Routes to Helvellyn can be used to give a start before branching off to White Side. Alternatively a more direct path from behind Fisher Place makes straight for the summit. From Glenridding in the east a bridleway zig-zags up beside Kepple Cove to reach the ridge not far from the top. It is also possible to take a direct (and steep) line direct from Brown Cove Dam.\n"}

{"id": "2160901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160901", "title": "Resentment", "text": "Resentment\n\nResentment (also called ranklement or bitterness) is a complex, multilayered emotion that has been described as a mixture of disappointment, disgust, anger, and fear. Other psychologists consider it a mood or as a secondary emotion (including cognitive elements) that can be elicited in the face of insult and/or injury.\n\nInherent in resentment is a perception of unfairness (i.e. from trivial to very serious), and is a generalized defense against unfair situations (e.g. relationships or unfavourable circumstances).\n\nThe word originates from French \"\"ressentir\"\", re-, intensive prefix, and \"sentir\" \"to feel\"; from the Latin \"\"sentire\"\". The English word has become synonymous with anger, spite, and holding a grudge.\n\nResentment can result from a variety of situations involving a perceived wrongdoing from an individual, which are often sparked by expressions of injustice or humiliation. Common sources of resentment include publicly humiliating incidents such as accepting negative treatment without voicing any protest; feeling like an object of regular discrimination or prejudice; envy/jealousy; feeling used or taken advantage of by others; and having achievements go unrecognized, while others succeed without working as hard. Resentment can also be generated by dyadic interactions, such as emotional rejection or denial by another person, deliberate embarrassment or belittling by another person, or ignorance, putting down, or scorn by another person.\n\nIt's worth noting that resentment can also develop, and be maintained by: focusing on past grievances (i.e. disturbing memories of hurtful experiences) continuously. or by trying to justify the emotion (i.e. with additional thoughts/feelings). Thus, resentment can occur as a result of the grief process and can be sustained by ruminating.\n\nResentment has healthy and unhealthy aspects.\n\nAlice MacLachlan writes \"What we resent reveals what it is we value, and what we have come to expect (or hope) from others; it may also reveal to what we see ourselves as \"entitled\" {to}: that is, how our expectations of our surroundings are organized and measured.\" Indeed, she goes on to further write that only an amoral person (a person who didn't have values or concern for the well-being of self or others) could not experience resentment.\n\nResentment can also function to \"warn\" against further, future, harmful and unfair situations from occurring again (its focus is on the future). Resentment, used as a form of distrust, has a strong component of self-punishment: \"the false appeal of self-punishment is that it \"seems\" to keep us safe from future hurt and disappointment\", when in reality it is hurting the resenter more (i.e. how we mistreat or distrust others unrelated to the offense, ourselves, etc.).\n\nResentment has also been conceptualized as a form of \"protest\": \"More specifically, resentment protests a past action, that persists as a present threat\". The 'present threat' being that the past harmful action(s), makes a claim: that you can be treated this way, or that such treatment is acceptable; It poses a threat, and in resenting it, you challenge that claim (i.e. protest). \"Resentment affirms what the {offenders'} act denies\"- its harmfulness and the victim's worth. It's worth noting that Pamela Hieronym claims the object of protest is the past event, rather than the offender of the event: claiming that resentment need not develop into malice or a desire for retribution (if resentment is focused on the past harmful situation or event, rather than the person who caused it).\n\nResentment, when it is unhealthy, can come in the form of: hostile anger with a retaliation motive (i.e. fantasizing about putting someone down, devaluing, or paying someone back for a perceived injury), time duration (which can go on for days, weeks, or even years), or when too many resentments are held; Thus, draining resources, creating stress, and draining positive emotions.\n\nUnlike many emotions, resentment does not have physical tags exclusively related to it that telegraph when a person is feeling this emotion. However, physical expressions associated with related emotions such as anger and envy may be exhibited, such as furrowed brows or bared teeth.\n\nResentment can be self-diagnosed by looking for signs such as the need for emotion regulation, faking happiness while with a person to cover true feelings toward him, or speaking in a sarcastic or demeaning way to or about the person. It can also be diagnosed through the appearance of agitation- or dejection-related emotions, such as feeling inexplicably depressed or despondent, becoming angry for no apparent reason, or having nightmares or disturbing daydreams about a person.\n\nResentment is most powerful when it is felt toward someone whom the individual is close to or intimate with. To have an injury resulting in resentful feelings inflicted by a friend or loved one leaves the individual feeling betrayed as well as resentful, and these feelings can have deep effects.\n\nResentment can have a variety of negative results on the person experiencing it, including touchiness or edginess when thinking of the person resented, denial of anger or hatred against this person, and provocation or anger arousal when this person is recognized positively. It can also have more long-term effects, such as the development of a hostile, cynical, sarcastic attitude that may become a barrier against other healthy relationships; lack of personal and emotional growth; difficulty in self-disclosure; trouble trusting others; loss of self-confidence; and overcompensation.\n\nChronic resentment (i.e. too many) can also lead to unhealthy symptoms such as: constriction of nerve endings in your muscles (causing chronic, low-grade muscle and back-pain).\n\nLong-lasting (i.e. too long) resentment can cause: destruction of T cell (lowering the immune system), hypertension (which increases the threat of stroke and heart attack), cancer, (drug) addictions, depression, and shortened life span.\n\nTo further compound these negative effects, resentment often functions in a downward spiral. Resentful feelings cut off communication between the resentful person and the person he or she feels committed the wrong, and can result in future miscommunications and the development of further resentful feelings. Because of the consequences they carry, resentful feelings are dangerous to live with and need to be dealt with. Resentment is an obstacle to the restoration of equal moral relations among persons.\n\nResentment and spite also share a connection of self-harm, yet differ primarily in the way they are expressed. Resentment is unique in that it is almost exclusively internalized, where it can do further emotional and psychological damage but does not strongly impact the person resented. By contrast, spite is exclusively externalized, involving vindictive actions against a (perceived or actual) source of wrong. Spiteful actions can stem from resentful feelings, however.\n\nPsychologist James J. Messina recommends five steps to facing and resolving resentful feelings: (1) Identify the source of the resentful feelings and what it is the person did to evoke these feelings; (2) develop a new way of looking at past, present and future life, including how resentment has affected life and how letting go of resentment can improve the future; (3) write a letter to the source of the resentment, listing offenses and explaining the circumstances, then forgive and let go of the offenses (but do not send the letter); (4) visualize a future without the negative impact of resentment; and (5) if resentful feelings still linger, return to Step 1 and begin again.\n\nRobert C. Solomon, a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, places resentment on the same continuum as anger and contempt, and he argues that the differences between the three are that resentment is anger directed toward a higher-status individual; anger is directed toward an equal-status individual; and contempt is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.\n\nSteven Stosny makes an analogy, distinguishing the functions of anger and resentment, as: anger being a fire-extinguisher meant to 'put-out' and prevent immediately harmful situations, from becoming more harmful, while resentment is more like a smoke-alarm: something that is always 'on' (and requires energy and emotions to sustain this alarm-system), and is meant to protect us if, just in case, someone or something harmful from past experience shows up. Resentment and anger differ primarily in the way they are externally expressed. Anger results in aggressive behavior, used to avert or deal with a threat, while resentment occurs once the injury has been dealt and is not expressed as aggressively or as openly.\n\nAnother differentiation between anger and resentment, is as follows: anger is about the immediate situation (to back off or submit), whereas resentment is a defensive way to \"mentally\" punish (or in the more extreme case, to devalue) yourself, or the \"remembered\" offender. Another differentiation is that\nresentment is rarely (if ever) about a single specific stimulus: even after behavioural changes have been made (i.e. accountability has been addressed) or the stimulus is no longer present (i.e. situation is no longer encountered) resentment can still be present. Whereas anger is triggered by a specific stimulus, and usually reduces in intensity as the stimulus attenuates (or is no longer present).\n\nAn important feature of \"acting\" on resentment is that it is \"against\" something (i.e. unfairness, injustice, abuse, situations that threaten values or well-being). Whereas, acting on conviction is \"for\" something (i.e. justice, well-being of self or others, or any other values held by an individual as important). The distinction is important, when acted upon, because while acting \"for\" your deeper values creates actions consistent with your values, acting \"against\" things (or people) you do not value does not necessarily lead to actions that are consistent with your deeper values (i.e. retribution, murder). Self-reflection can help determine which of the two you are acting on, by stating why the behavior is consistent with your deeper values: if your answer represents conviction, it will reflect your deeper values; if it is resentful it will devalue someone or something.\n\n\nThe Alcoholics Anonymous organization cites resentment as the number one offender, and one of the greatest threats to an alcoholic. Several of the Twelve Steps (step 4 inventory, step 5 inventory review, step 6 asking the fear to be removed, step 7 asking the shortcoming to be removed, step 8 creation of a list detailing any wrongdoing done, and step 9 actively seeking to make amends) of AA involve identifying and dealing with resentment as part of the path toward recovery, including acknowledging one's own role in resentment and praying for the resentment to be taken away. The inventory that AA suggests for dealing with recovering from resentments is to first inventory the resentment by identifying what person, organization, idea or thing is the source of the resentment, then to identify why it is that thing is causing the resentment and what fear is underlying the conflict. Finally, removing the other person entirely, one must ask himself/herself what is my own part in this play? The book Alcoholics Anonymous then recommends following through with more action.\n\nResentment can also play a role in racial and ethnic conflicts. Resentment is cited as having infected the structure of social value, and is thus a regular catalyst in conflicts sparked by inequality. It can also be one of the emotions experienced during class conflict, particularly by the oppressed social class.\n\n\n"}

He played for the Washington Capitals, Nashville Predators, and New York Islanders in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nWitt's NHL career began with the Washington Capitals, the team that drafted him in the 1993 Entry Draft. In the 2000–01 NHL season, he led the league with 322 hits. Witt served as co-captain of the Washington Capitals during the 2001–02 NHL season, along with Steve Konowalchuk. Witt lost his share of the captaincy, when in a player vote (before the 2002–03 NHL season), the Capitals chose Konowalchuk as sole captain. After Konowalchuk's trade to the Avalanche (October 2003), the captaincy remained vacant until Jeff Halpern was appointed in September 2005.\n\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout Witt signed for the English BNL side, the Bracknell Bees. He only played three games for Bracknell before returning home due to a fire at his house. During his three games he scored one goal and got four assists for a total of five points.\n\nIn August 2005, Witt made a trade request to the Capitals management, to be traded a team with a better chance of competing for the Stanley Cup. Re-signed by the Capitals despite his trade request, he remained on the Capitals defense to start the 2005–06 season. His request for a trade was finally granted by the Capitals on March 9, 2006, when he was shipped to the Nashville Predators for former Capital Kris Beech and a first-round draft pick.\n\nOn July 3, 2006, Witt signed a three-year contract as a free agent with the New York Islanders and was named an alternate captain. On July 8, 2008, with a year of his original Islander contract still remaining, Witt signed a 2-year, $6 million extension to remain with the New York Islanders. During the 2008–09 season, on February 27, 2009, the NHL suspended Witt 5 games for an elbow to the head of Toronto Maple Leafs forward Niklas Hagman resulting in a concussion.\n\nIn January 2010, Witt was sent to the Islanders affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, of the American Hockey League after clearing waivers. Completing the season with 2 goals in 27 games for Bridgeport, Witt was then bought out from the remaining year of his contract with the Islanders on August 1, 2010.\n\nWitt and his wife, Salima have two daughters, Aliana and Safiya. On January 30, 2007, Witt was the subject of a Sports Illustrated article in which he showed off his tattoos.\n\nOn December 8, 2009, while in Philadelphia for a game later that day against the Flyers, Witt was hit by a truck while crossing Arch Street in Center City Philadelphia. A truck made an illegal turn and hit Witt who tried to jump on the hood of the vehicle before being thrown to the ground as he was hit. Witt picked himself up off the road, cursed, and assured the stunned onlookers that he was ok.

{"id": "2160910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160910", "title": "The Gay Science", "text": "The Gay Science\n\nThe Gay Science () or occasionally translated as The Joyful Wisdom is a book by Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1882 and followed by a second edition, which was published after the completion of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" and \"Beyond Good and Evil\", in 1887. This substantial expansion includes a fifth book and an appendix of songs. It was noted by Nietzsche to be \"the most personal of all [his] books\", and contains the greatest number of poems in any of his published works.\n\nThe book's title, in the original German and in translation, uses a phrase that was well-known at the time in many European cultures and had specific meaning. \n\nOne of its earliest literary uses is in Rabelais's \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" (\"gai sçavoir\"). It was derived from a Provençal expression (\"gai saber\") for the technical skill required for poetry-writing. The expression proved durable and was used as late as 19th century American English by Ralph Waldo Emerson and E. S. Dallas. It was also used in deliberately inverted form, by Thomas Carlyle in \"the dismal science\", to criticize the emerging discipline of economics by comparison with poetry. \n\nThe book's title was first translated into English as \"The Joyful Wisdom\", but \"The Gay Science\" has become the common translation since Walter Kaufmann's version in the 1960s. Kaufmann cites \"The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" (1955) that lists \"The gay science (Provençal \"gai saber\"): the art of poetry.\"\n\nIn \"Ecce Homo\", Nietzsche refers to the poems in the Appendix of \"The Gay Science\", saying they were\n\nThis alludes to the birth of modern European poetry that occurred in Provence around the 11th century, whereupon, after the culture of the troubadours fell into almost complete desolation and destruction due to the Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229), other poets in the 14th century ameliorated and thus cultivated the \"gai saber\" or \"gaia scienza\". In a similar vein, in \"Beyond Good and Evil\" Nietzsche observed that,\n\nThe original English translation as \"The Joyful Wisdom\" could be considered more comprehensible to the modern reader given changes in English usage for both \"gay\" and \"science\" in the second half of the twentieth century. However, it could be considered flawed in poorly reflecting the then still-current use of the phrase in its original meaning for poetry, which Nietszche was deliberately evoking, poorly reflecting the Provencal and French origins of the phrase, and in poorly translating the German. The German \"fröhliche\" can be translated \"happy\" or \"joyful\", cognate to the original meanings of \"gay\" in English and other languages. However \"Wissenschaft\" never indicates \"wisdom\" (wisdom = \"Weisheit\"), but a propensity toward any rigorous practice of a poised, controlled, and disciplined quest for knowledge. This word is typically translated to English as \"science\", both in this broader meaning and for the specific sets of discplines now called \"sciences\" in English. The term \"science\" formerly had a similarly broad connotation in English, referring to useful bodies of knowledge or skills, from the Latin \"scientia\". \n\nThe book is usually placed within Nietzsche's middle period, during which his work extolled the merits of science, skepticism, and intellectual discipline as routes to mental freedom. The affirmation of the Provençal tradition (invoked through the book's title) is also one of a joyful \"yea-saying\" to life.\n\nIn \"The Gay Science,\" Nietzsche experiments with the notion of power but does not advance any systematic theory.\n\nThe book contains Nietzsche's first consideration of the idea of the eternal recurrence, a concept which would become critical in his next work \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" and underpins much of the later works.\nHere is also the first occurrence of the famous formulation \"God is dead\", first in section 108.\nSection 125 depicts the parable of the madman who is searching for God. He accuses us all of being the murderers of God. \"'Where is God?' he cried; 'I will tell you. \"We have killed him\"—you and I. All of us are his murderers...\"\n\n\n"}

It has around 1,400 inhabitants.\n\nVillages Chrastová Lhota, Moravská Chrastová and Podlesí are administrative parts of Brněnec.\n\nNext to an old trade route, the settlement of Moravská Chrastová was founded after 1200 by monks from a monastery in Litomyšl. It is first mentioned in a document from 1323.\n\nThe first written mention of Brněnec is to be found in the 1557 act of partition of the dominion of Swojanow. In 1892, workers carrying out improvements to the Bělá nad Svitavou road stumbled upon the remnants of prehistoric clay jars in the vicinity of the Nová Amerika (\"New America\") inn, one kilometre west of Brněnec. Systematic excavation on this site in 1893 unearthed further archaeological finds. A neighbouring hillside of crevices and caves, known as Jeskyně Čertovy, had already yielded traces of earlier settlements.\n\nUntil 1918, the village was part of the Austrian empire (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the Polička district, one of the 94 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in Bohemia. A post-office was opened in 1869.\n\nWith the construction of the railway from Prague to Brno (before 1850?), Brněnec received its own railway station on this main line. This encouraged numerous new industrial enterprises such as textile factories to develop around the dominant business of the Daubek mills.\n\nIn 1930, the municipality of Brněnec (including the then districts of Zářečí nad Svitavou, now part of the municipality of Březová nad Svitavou, and Podlesí counted 606 inhabitants, of whom 208 held German nationality. In 1939, as a result of German occupation and the ensuing retreat of Czech inhabitants, the total population had dropped to 490.\n\nThe municipality extended at that time only to the Bohemian right bank of the river Svitava. On the opposite Moravian bank was the independent village of Moravská Chrastová, which, together with its districts of Chrastová Lhota and Půlpecen (now part of the municipality of Chrastavec), had a total population in 1939 of 1,143 inhabitants and was therefore twice the size of Brněnec.\n\nThe town of Brněnec formed part of the administrative and judiciary region of Politschka. After the annexation of the \"Sudetenland\" by Germany, it was integrated into the county of Zwittau.\n\nIn 1944, Oskar Schindler relocated his German Enamelware Factory (), and the associated prison camp of 1,200 Jewish forced labourers, from Kraków to a munitions factory acquired by him in Brněnec. The Jewish workforce thus escaped transport to the extermination camps and was liberated along with the rest of the village on 10 May 1945 by the Red Army, after the factory had been fully operational for seven months.

He represented a militant French Catholic element in the French Army, and later headed the Fédération Nationale Catholique, a short-lived movement (1924-1944) which espoused a socio-religious political ideology, driven by conservative Catholic dogma.\n\nDespite his significant achievements during the war, he was never named Marshal of France, perhaps owing to his staunch Catholicism, his consistent anti-semitic posture regarding the Dreyfus Affair, and the emerging dominance of a more secular and egalitarian mood in France after the Armistice.\n\nBorn in Aveyron to an Occitan family with a long history in their home province of Languedoc. His father was a lawyer who had once been the mayor of St. Affrique. Édouard was described as a broadly-built man of short stature, with dark hair and a tan complexion, and a perpetually serious look. He joined the army in 1870 and fought in the Franco-Prussian War, 1870–71. He was Catholic and nicknamed \"le Capucin Botté\" (the fighting friar). \nIn 1900 he was removed from the General Staff for his anti-semitic, anti-Dreyfusard attitude. Nevertheless, Castelnau later became deputy to Joseph Joffre from 1911 to 1914, and helped develop the strategic Plan XVII for the recapture of Alsace-Lorraine as part of an invasion of Germany. In 1914 with war imminent, General de Castelnau was put in command of the French 2nd Army facing the oncoming Germans in Belgium. Under his leadership, in August 1914, the French 2nd Army was decisively routed by the Germans at the Battle of the Frontiers under Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, with the initial French 2nd Army offensive (along with the French 1st Army) being driven back by the Germans 25 km (16 mi) from the positions where the offensive had initially begun on 14 August. By the end of August, however, the French won back most of the territory lost in the hard-fought Battle of the Trouée de Charmes. The Battle of the Trouée de Charmes was a definitive victory for the Second Army; in stopping the Germans from passing through the Trouée de Charmes, de Castelnau possibly saved the French from disaster. The French were able to then organize a defense at Nancy and hold the city after victory in the Battle of Grand Couronné. It was suggested that this battle was decisive in the protection of Paris, by binding up significant German resources in static trench warfare for the duration in Lorraine.\n\nIn June 1915 de Castelnau was appointed to command the newly created Central Army Group. Later that year he was made chief of staff to Joffre, and in 1916 he organised the initial defence at the Battle of Verdun, before appointing Philippe Pétain to the command.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Joffre and the appointment of Robert Nivelle in 1916, Castelnau retired from active service. He was later sent on the Allied Mission to Russia in the early months of 1917, just prior to the Fall of the Tsar. When Nivelle was dismissed and replaced by Philippe Pétain, Castelnau was recalled to the command of the Eastern Army Group where he commanded the advance into Lorraine in 1918.\n\nThree of Castelnau's sons were killed in the war. Recognizing the hopelessness of modern trench warfare, he once remarked: \"Ah, Napoleon, Napoleon. If he were here now, he'd have thought of something else.\"\n\nAfter the war he entered politics. In 1919 he was elected to parliament as a deputy of Bloc National for Aveyron. In 1924 he founded the Fédération Nationale Catholique, which advanced a socio-religious model of France that has been described as \"National Catholicism\". In the same year Castelnau wrote an anti-Masonry pamphlet titled \"La dictature de la maçonnerie en France\" (The Dictatorship of the Masonry in France); he further publicized his accusations in a series of articles in \"Echo de Paris\". Although his Catholic Federation reached one million members in 1925, its significance was short-lived and it subsided into obscurity by 1930.\n\nRue De Castelnau and De Castelnau metro station in Montreal are named after the general.\nSchool year n° 198 of the Ecole Speciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr (2011-2014) called Castelnau's school year\" honours the general Castelnau.\n\n\n"}

Although many old Jomaligins (its people) doesn't know or couldn't remember where Jomalig derived its name, there are few old residents who still remember the wonderful legend from their ancestors. Based on the story, there was a Datu who lived in island and had a beautiful daughter. A young man from a neighboring island wanted to marry the princess but Datu didn't agree with it. The Datu said that he will only give his daughter if the young man can roam the island in just one day and successfully shoot three fishes in every pond on the island. The young man took the Datu's challenge. After he roamed the island, he almost finished the marathon, but in the end, failed to do so because he nearly died. He arrived at the finish line hopelessly and at this point, he requested the princess to kiss him as the only reward he could receive. The people in island witnessed what happened she kissed the young man and they shouted: \"humalik\" (They kissed). From that time on, the people on the island named the island \"Humalik\". Many years passed and the Humalik become Jomalig.
