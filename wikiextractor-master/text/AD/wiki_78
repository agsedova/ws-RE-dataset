It was released in January 1998 as the third single from their second album, \"The Colour and the Shape\" (1997). The song reached number 6 on the US \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart.\n\nAlthough the song was first released on \"The Colour and the Shape\" album in 1997, it had been played live as early as 1995.\n\nAccording to Dave Grohl, the song is dedicated to ordinary, everyday heroes, as he himself never had musical or sports heroes growing up as a child. During Foo Fighters' appearance on \"VH1 Storytellers\" in 2009, Grohl explained that the song was written while watching 1980s movies like \"Valley Girl\". Grohl also stated that the song was written about Pete Stahl and Chip Donaldson, without even knowing it.\n\nMany people think that the song is about Grohl's close friend and former Nirvana band-mate Kurt Cobain. In 1997, Grohl said, \"There's definitely an element of Kurt in that song\". However, Grohl showed disapproval of this interpretation in a 1999 interview on \"The Howard Stern Show\" when co-host Robin Quivers said \"I think it is about Kurt Cobain\" to which Grohl replied \"hmmmm, maybe\". Bradley Cook, the recording engineer for the song, has said that Grohl told him that the song is about Kurt Cobain.\n\nThe recording of the song itself was done using two different drum tracks played back simultaneously for the intro and verses. On one track, Dave Grohl played using the bass drum, hi-hat, snare drum, and crash cymbals. On the second track, it is again the bass drum, but plays the rack and floor toms as well as the snare. Because of the drums being recorded as double-tracked, live performances use a more simplified beat.\n\nThe music video was directed by Dave Grohl. It features a man running into a burning building to rescue a woman's baby, another woman's dog, and finally a picture frame of the first woman. The eyes of both the baby and the dog are blocked out to show they represent people in need everywhere. The camera follows the man throughout the video, with his face never being shown. It is presented in a continuous \"long take\" format, although actual transitional cuts are disguised by smoke. During shots inside the building, the band is seen performing the song, seemingly unconcerned about the chaos around them. It is the only Foo Fighters video to feature guitarist Franz Stahl, who replaced Pat Smear (Stahl did not appear in the video for the next and last single from the album, 1998's \"Walking After You\", as it featured only Grohl).\n\nThe song was featured in the movie \"Varsity Blues\" during the climactic scene of the final football game. The scene was later parodied in the 2001 film \"Not Another Teen Movie\". The song also appeared in the 2010 films \"Somewhere\" and \"The Other Guys\" when part of the song was heard during the scene where two characters (played by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) jump to their death (the song ending rather abruptly when they hit the ground). Perhaps as a tribute to the use in the latter film (as it took place in the city), New York radio station WNYL used the song to launch its alternative rock format on November 17, 2017.\n\nIn a post-September 11 episode of CBS's \"The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn\" (September 21, 2001), Grohl and bassist Nate Mendel performed an acoustic rendition of the song. A full group acoustic version is available on the 2006 live album and DVD \"Skin and Bones\". An acoustic version was also performed live on \"The Howard Stern Show\" by Grohl. The 2006 album \"Sound of Superman\" features an acoustic cover of \"My Hero\" by Paramore.\n\n\"My Hero\" was featured in the game \"Gran Turismo 2\". The song, along with the rest of the album, was released as downloadable content for the \"Rock Band\" series of music video games on November 13, 2008.\n\nIt is also one of 38 songs included on the benefit album, \"Songs for Japan\" (compiled in response to the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Tōhoku), released on March 25, 2011.\n\nIn 2008, the Foo Fighters criticized the campaign of Republican presidential candidate John McCain for using their song at rallies without their permission.\n\nFoo Fighters responded to the incident saying: \"It's frustrating and infuriating that someone who claims to speak for the American people would repeatedly show such little respect for creativity and intellectual property. . . The saddest thing about this is that 'My Hero' was written as a celebration of the common man and his extraordinary potential. To have it appropriated without our knowledge and used in a manner that perverts the original sentiment of the lyric just tarnishes the song.\"\n\nThe McCain campaign noted that the song was used properly under blanket licensing (which does not require the artist's permission), and all proper royalties were paid.\n\nHowever, the band played a stripped down, acoustic version of the song live, during an appearance at the end of the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPreviously, Republican President George W. Bush had used Foo Fighters' 2003 single \"Times Like These\" during his 2004 re-election campaign without the band's knowledge or consent. This prompted the band to perform a slew of shows in support of Democratic candidate John Kerry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe song has been covered by:\nDave Grohl also played a solo version of it in Radio 1's Live Lounge\n\nLive version\n"}

They are sometimes said to have silver hair. They stand about two feet tall.\n\nThe Yumboes live beneath the Paps hills and come out to dance in the moonlight. They feast on large tables, waited on by servants who are invisible except for their hands and feet. Yumboes eat corn (which they steal from the humans) and fish (which they catch on their own). They invite both natives and foreigners to their feasts.\n\nThe only source for yumboes is Thomas Keightley's book \"The Fairy Mythology.\" Keightley received his account from a woman who had lived on Goree Island, off the coast of Senegal, when she was a child. She had heard about the yumboes from a Wolof maid. Keightley remarked on the yumboes’ resemblance to European fairies. However, they are also examples of the ancestral ghosts described in many African countries.\n\nOn Pottermore, yumboes appeared as African house elves and the mascots of Senegal's national quidditch team.\n\nOne of the adventure gamebooks based on the television series \"Knightmare\" features yumboes as savage, flesh-eating creatures. Alighting on their island causes them to attack the player.\n"}

It is the City's official economic development corporation and merged with the New York City Economic Growth Corporation in 2012. Based out of Lower Manhattan, its formation followed recommendations from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\n, its Board of Directors has 27 members. The Mayor of New York appoints seven members, including the chairperson. Ten additional members are appointed by the Mayor from nominees of the Borough Presidents and the Speaker of the New York City Council. Each Borough President nominates one member and the Speaker nominates five. Ten are appointed by the Chairperson from a list of persons approved by the Mayor. NYCEDC is not a New York City agency.\n\nThrough annual contracts with the City of New York, NYCEDC is a nonprofit organization that serves as the City’s primary entity for promoting and implementing economic development.\n\n, the NYCEDC had a role in setting rates of business taxation, an alternative to the passing of tax legislation. Specifically, the Corporation was charged with negotiating firm-specific tax incentives with businesses as encouragement to either relocate to, or remain in, New York City.\n\nThe organization also:\n\nNYCEDC was formed in 1991 as the result of a merger of two major not-for-profit and a handful of minor corporations which performed economic development services for the City. One of the major merger partners was the Public Development Corporation (PDC), formed in 1966 to rescue the City from its then-deteriorating economy by selling City property and leasing industrial space. PDC was responsible for construction of the Nassau Street Mall, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Jamaica Center, and the South Street Seaport, among other activities. The second major merger partner was the Financial Services Corporation (FSC) formed in 1980 to administer government financing programs that promote business expansion in New York City. Formation of the NYCEDC followed recommendations from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, who had been engaged in mid-1990 to \"advise on the reorganisation of the NYC development system.\n\nCarl Weisbrod, formerly of PDC prior to its merger with FSC, was the first president of NYCEDC under the Dinkins administration. Weisbrod was succeeded by Charles Millard and Michael G. Carey under the Giuliani administration, followed by Andrew Alper, the first president appointed to the position during the Bloomberg administration. Robert C. Lieber was appointed in January 2007 and served until Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed him as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development & Rebuilding in December 2007. Seth Pinsky served as President from February 2008 to August 2013.\n\nOne of NYCEDC’s largest initiatives to date is Applied Sciences NYC, a competition to create a new world-class engineering campus in NYC. In December 2011, Mayor Bloomberg announced the selection of a historic partnership with Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to create a groundbreaking, two-million-square foot applied science and engineering campus on Roosevelt Island, to be called Cornell Tech. Applied Sciences NYC is expected to more than double the number of both full-time graduate engineering students and faculty in New York City. Over the next three decades the Applied Sciences NYC initiative is expected to generate more than $33 billion in overall nominal economic impact, add over 48,000 jobs, and launch nearly 1,000 spin-off companies. The Applied Sciences NYC initiative also includes the establishment of a campus in Downtown Brooklyn developed by a consortium led by NYU that focuses on the challenges facing cities, and a new institute for data sciences at Columbia University.\n\nNew York City Industrial Development Agency (NYCIDA) is a public benefit corporation under New York State law that provides companies with access to tax-exempt bond financing or tax benefits to strengthen and diversify the City’s tax and employment base, helps businesses locate and expand their operations within New York City, and encourages economic development by retaining jobs and creating new ones. NYCIDA is administered by NYCEDC.\n\nNew York City Capital Resource Corporation (NYCCRC), also administered by NYCEDC, is a local development corporation that provides lower-cost financing programs for eligible capital projects to qualified not-for-profit institutions and manufacturing, industrial, and other businesses.\n\nNYCEDC's joint projects with New York City as of 2018 include:\n\nIn November 2018, the news media reported that Amazon.com was in final talks with the government of New York State to construct one of two campuses for its proposed Amazon HQ2 at Queens West in Long Island City. (The other campus would be located at National Landing in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia.) The selection was confirmed by Amazon on November 13, 2018, but on February 14, 2019, Amazon announced it was pulling out, citing unexpected opposition from local lawmakers and unions.\n\nNYCEDC has been involved in plans to redevelop miles of the City’s working waterfront. It states that it helps improve public access to waterfronts through projects such as the construction of the East River Waterfront Esplanade along a two-mile shorefront of Lower Manhattan.\n\n"}

After two years study, he began to apply himself to jurisprudence.\n\nHe later contributed to the development of international law in works like \"De Dominio Maris Dissertatio\" (1702); \"Observationes Juris Romani\" (1710), of which a continuation in four books appeared in 1733; the treatise \"De foro legatorum\" (1721); and the \"Quaestiones Juris Publici\" (1737). Complete editions of his works were published after his death; one in folio at Geneva in 1761, and another in two volumes folio at Leiden in 1766. He was president of the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (Supreme Court of the Dutch Republic) from 1724 to 1743.\n\nVan Bynkershoek was especially important in the development of the Law of the Sea. In particular he furthered Hugo Grotius' idea that coastal states have a right to the adjoining waters the width of which had to correspond to the capacity of exercising an effective control over it, that he expressed in his famous book De Iure Belli Ac Pacis. Bynkershoek translated Grotius idea into practical terms, by arguing that such effective control has to correspond to the range of the coastal state's weapons: \"terrae potestas finitur ubi finitur armorum vis\". However, it was not him, but the Italian Ferdinand Galiami who calculated the range of the most advanced cannon at the time to three nautical miles or a league. This idea became common practice and was known as the \"cannon shot rule\" and was regarded as the internationally accepted measure of the width of the territorial sea.\n"}

The classic gables of Amsterdam’s canal houses inspired the arches and lateral gables and the wavy patterns refer to water. The segmented appearance is based on the skeleton of a crab. The shallowness of the water at the bridge site made it impossible to use floating cranes to lift the pre-assembled arches of the bridge into position during construction.

The LMTD is a logarithmic average of the temperature difference between the hot and cold feeds at each end of the double pipe exchanger. For a given heat exchanger with constant area and heat transfer coefficient, the larger the LMTD, the more heat is transferred. The use of the LMTD arises straightforwardly from the analysis of a heat exchanger with constant flow rate and fluid thermal properties.\n\nWe assume that a generic heat exchanger has two ends (which we call \"A\" and \"B\") at which the hot and cold streams enter or exit on either side; then, the LMTD is defined by the logarithmic mean as follows:\n\nwhere \"ΔT\" is the temperature difference between the two streams at end \"A\", and \"ΔT\" is the temperature difference between the two streams at end \"B\". With this definition, the LMTD can be used to find the exchanged heat in a heat exchanger:\n\nWhere \"Q\" is the exchanged heat duty (in watts), \"U\" is the heat transfer coefficient (in watts per kelvin per square meter) and \"A\" is the exchange area. Note that estimating the heat transfer coefficient may be quite complicated.\n\nThis holds both for cocurrent flow, where the streams enter from the same end, and for countercurrent flow, where they enter from different ends.\n\nIn a cross-flow, in which one system, usually the heat sink, has the same nominal temperature at all points on the heat transfer surface, a similar relation between exchanged heat and LMTD holds, but with a correction factor. A correction factor is also required for other more complex geometries, such as a shell and tube exchanger with baffles.\n\nAssume heat transfer is occurring in a heat exchanger along an axis \"z\", from generic coordinate \"A\" to \"B\", between two fluids, identified as \"1\" and \"2\", whose temperatures along \"z\" are T(z) and T(z).\n\nThe local exchanged heat flux at \"z\" is proportional to the temperature difference:\n\nwhere \"D\" is the distance between the two fluids.\n\nThe heat that leaves the fluids causes a temperature gradient according to Fourier's law:\nwhere k and k are the thermal conductivities of the intervening material at points A and B respectively. Summed together, this becomes\n\nwhere \"K=k+k\".\n\nThe total exchanged energy is found by integrating the local heat transfer \"q\" from \"A\" to \"B\":\n\nUse the fact that the heat exchanger area \"Ar\" is the pipe length \"B\"-\"A\" multiplied by the interpipe distance \"D\":\n\nIn both integrals, make a change of variables from \"z\" to \"Δ T\":\n\nWith the relation for \"Δ T\" found above, this becomes\n\nIntegration at this point is trivial, and finally gives:\n\nfrom which the definition of LMTD follows.\n\n•Steady flow,\n• No phase change during heat Transfer\n• neglect the change in kinetic energy\nand potential energy.\n\n"}

It travels from IL 47 in Yorkville to Interstate 55 (I-55) between Plainfield and Bolingbrook.\n\nIL 126 begins at an intersection with IL 47 in Yorkville, and travels as a rural two-lane road until it intersects historic Lincoln Highway and enters Plainfield as West Lockport Road. Immediately after crossing the DuPage River, it turns northeast onto Main Street, bypassing Downtown Plainfield, and intersects the concurrency of US 30 and IL 59 at North Division Street. It continues northeastward out of Plainfield on Main Street until it ends at an intersection with I-55. There is no access to IL 126 from northbound I-55. Likewise, there is no southbound I-55 access from IL 126.\nFor most of its length, IL 126 is an undivided two-lane surface road, until a high-speed ramp is used to access northbound I-55 at its eastern terminus.\n\nCongestion in Plainfield is increasing substantially on this highway, IL 59, and US 30 because of near-explosive growth in Plainfield, a southwest suburb of Chicago.\n\nThe history of IL 126, in both of its incarnations, is tied closely to the history of US 66.\n\nThe original State Bond Issue Route 126 (SBI 126) was opened in 1930 to carry the then-new US 66 from Springfield to Litchfield, bypassing the numerous towns along IL 4. Initially, this road was marked as both US 66 and IL 126. In 1934, the concurrency of IL 126 was removed, and this road was known only as US 66.\n\nSBI 66 originally traveled from Plainfield to Welco Corners in present-day Bolingbrook, where it intersected SBI 4. However, by then, SBI 4 was also designated as US 66, which created confusion with IL 66, so, in 1935, IL 66 was given the route number \"126\", which had been removed from US 66 in southern Illinois, and the new IL 126 was extended west from Plainfield to Yorkville.\n\nIn 1940, US 66 was rerouted through Plainfield to bypass congestion in Joliet, and IL 126 was truncated to travel only from Yorkville to Plainfield, with US 66 taking over IL 126 (SBI 66) from Plainfield to Welco Corners.\nWhen US 66 was rerouted in 1957 onto its new freeway alignment bypassing Plainfield, which would later become I-55, IL 126 was re-extended east from Plainfield along its pre-1940 route to meet I-55/US 66. This resulted in the section of the highway from Plainfield to I-55/US 66 having had four route numbers in its history: 66, 126, 66 (again), and 126 (again).\n\nUntil US 30 was rerouted in 2008, IL 126 was concurrent with it for a short distance approaching Plainfield from the west, between Lincoln Highway and IL 126's turn to the northeast onto Main Street.\n\n"}

He played for Racing Club de Avellaneda and Huracán before becoming a manager. He coached many teams during his career, being most notable the Racing Club de Avellaneda (where he won the Supercopa Libertadores, the first international title for the club since 1967), the Argentina national team (with 4 titles won) and Boca Juniors, where he won five titles in two years.\n\nThe last team managed by Basile was Racing Club de Avellaneda, which he left in 2012.\n\nBasile started his playing career at Club Bella Vista in his home city. From 1964 to 1970 he played for Racing Club, where he played as midfielder until the arrival of coach Juan José Pizutti, who moved him to the defensive line to play as centre-back. In that position, Basile formed a remembered defensive pair with Roberto Perfumo, winning three titles with the club, which reached its peak with the Intercontinental Cup won in 1967 to Celtic FC, the first intercontinental title for an Argentine team.\n\nBasile totalized 186 matches with Racing Club before moving to Huracán, where he was a mainstay of the 1973 Metropolitano champions under coach César Luis Menotti. He also played for the Argentina national team. Basile retired as a player in 1975.\n\nAfter retirement as a player, Basile coached a number of Argentine teams, most notably Rosario Central, Racing Club, Huracán, Vélez Sársfield, Uruguayan Nacional, and Atlético Madrid.\nHis career as a coach reached its first peak in the early 1990s, when he led the Argentina national football team to two Copa América, one FIFA Confederations Cup and one Artemio Franchi Trophy victories. The run-up to the 1994 FIFA World Cup looked smooth until a 5-0 defeat at home to Colombia. Following that traumatic event, Diego Maradona was brought back from retirement to take part in the play-off against Australia.\n\nIn the World Cup itself, Argentina opened with two impressive victories over Greece and Nigeria. However, controversy was soon to appear. Maradona was tested for doping after the Nigeria match, and was suspended after ephedrine was found in his sample. Argentina still progressed to the last 16 despite a 2-0 defeat by Bulgaria, but morale was shattered and the team was eliminated after losing to Romania.\n\nAfter resigning over the World Cup disappointment, Basile went on to coach San Lorenzo de Almagro, Club América of México and Colón de Santa Fe with varying degrees of success. In July 2005 he assumed the post of coach at Boca Juniors, winning the Recopa Sudamericana 2005 just a month later. He then won his first Argentine league title in the 2005 Apertura tournament. Four days later, Boca won the Copa Sudamericana 2005 against UNAM Pumas of Mexico.\n\nIn July 2006, he was once again offered the position of Argentina national football team coach and accepted the job taking over from José Pekerman. Before starting his new job, Basile stayed with Boca Juniors until September 14, 2006, when the team won a second consecutive Recopa Sudamericana 2006 with a victory over São Paulo FC of Brazil.\n\nVocal about his preference for the Italian Serie A and the Spanish La Liga over the English league, he made waves in England when he called for Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to transfer to Italy, claiming the switch would be better for the latter \"even if he would have to play in the second division\" with Juventus.\nOn 16 October 2008, amidst the controversy over the historic defeat that Argentina suffered against Chile in the World Cup qualifiers, Basile tended his resignation. This eventually paved the road to the appointment of Diego Maradona as national team coach.\nAs a coach, Basile had in total two tenures at the helm of the Argentina national football team, 1991–1994 and 2006–2008.\n\nOn July 1, 2009 Alfio \"Coco\" Basile returned to Boca Juniors after three years, replacing Carlos Ischia. But after a series of bad results, especially the failure to qualify for the Copa Libertadores 2010 and a crushing 3-1 defeat to archrivals River Plate during a summer tournament at Mar del Plata, he resigned on 21 January 2010.\n\nOn 26 December 2011, Basile returned to Racing Club for his fourth spell as their coach, taking over from Diego Simeone. One year later, he resigned after a confusing incident in the Estadio Libertadores de América's change room, with Racing forward Teo Gutiérrez being accused of pointing a gun at a teammate.\n\nSince his departure from Racing, Basile has not managed any team, stating he is \"retired\" from the activity. Basile has occasionally appeared in some interviews and the TV show \"Buenos Muchachos\" (\"Good Guys\") where he participated along with fellow Héctor Veira and singer Cacho Castaña.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2289425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289425", "title": "Gastrocnemius muscle", "text": "Gastrocnemius muscle\n\nThe gastrocnemius muscle (plural \"gastrocnemii\") is a superficial two-headed muscle that is in the back part of the lower leg of humans. It runs from its two heads just above the knee to the heel, a three joint muscle (knee, ankle and subtalar joints). The muscle is named via Latin, from Greek \"γαστήρ\" (\"gaster\") 'belly' or 'stomach' and \"κνήμη\" (\"knḗmē\") 'leg', meaning 'stomach of leg' (referring to the bulging shape of the calf).\n\nThe gastrocnemius is located with the soleus in the posterior (back) compartment of the leg. The lateral head originates from the lateral condyle of the femur, while the medial head originates from the medial condyle of the femur. Its other end forms a common tendon with the soleus muscle; this tendon is known as the calcaneal tendon or Achilles tendon and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus, or heel bone. It is considered a superficial muscle as it is located directly under skin, and its shape may often be visualized through the skin.\n\nDeep to the gastrocnemius (farther from the skin) is the soleus muscle. Some anatomists consider both to be a single muscle—the triceps surae or \"three-headed [muscle] of the calf\"—since they share a common insertion via the Achilles tendon. The plantaris muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles, which is involved in \"locking\" the knee from the standing position. Since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment. The soleus is superficial to the mid-shaft of the tibia.\n\n10% to 30% of individuals have a sesamoid bone called the \"fabella\" in the lateral (outer) head of the gastrocnemius muscle.\n\nAlong with the soleus muscle, the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle. Its function is plantar flexing the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint.\n\nThe gastrocnemius is primarily involved in running, jumping and other \"fast\" movements of leg, and to a lesser degree in walking and standing. This specialization is connected to the predominance of white muscle fibers (type II fast twitch) present in the gastrocnemius, as opposed to the soleus, which has more red muscle fibers (type I slow twitch) and is the primary active muscle when standing still, as determined by EMG studies.\n\nThe plan to use the gastrocnemius in running, jumping, knee and plantar flexing is created in the precentral gyrus in the cerebrum of the brain. Once a plan is produced, the signal is sent to and down an upper motor neuron. The signal is passed through the internal capsule and decussates, or crosses, in the medulla oblongata, specifically in the lateral corticospinal tract. The signal continues down through the anterior horn of the spinal cord where the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron. Signal propagation continues down the anterior rami (Lumbar 4-5 and Sacral 1-5) of the sacral plexus. The sciatic nerve branches off of the sacral plexus in which the tibial and common fibular nerves are wrapped in one sheath. The tibial nerve eventually separates from the sciatic nerve and innervates the gastrocnemius muscle. Thus, completing the plan the brain had originally started with, so that the actions of running, standing, and jumping could be executed.\n\nThe gastrocnemius muscle is prone to spasms, which are painful, involuntary contractions of the muscle that may last several minutes.\n\nA severe ankle dorsiflexion force may result in an injury of the muscle, commonly referred to as a \"torn\" or \"strained\" calf muscle, which is acutely painful and disabling.\n\nThe gastrocnemius muscle may also become inflamed due to overuse. Anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy (heat, massage, and stretching) may be useful.\n\nAnatomical abnormalities involving the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle result in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.\n\nIn a 1967 EMG study, Herman and Bragin concluded that its most important role was plantar flexing in large contractions and in rapid development of tension.\n\n"}

In 1998 a re-recorded version appeared on \"\", the soundtrack to the original \"X-Files\" movie, and was released as a single.\n\nWhile none of the \"X-Files\" album songs are prominently featured in the movie itself, \"Walking After You\" is played during the end credit sequence, following Noel Gallagher's \"Teotihuacan.\" The single's B-side is Ween's \"Beacon Light\". The Foo Fighters had previously contributed a cover of Gary Numan's \"Down in the Park\" to the compilation album, \"Songs in the Key of X: Music From and Inspired by the X-Files\". Grohl is an avid \"X-Files\" fan.\n\n\"Walking After You\" was a hit in the UK and was performed live on the chart show Top of the Pops. The song, along with the rest of \"The Colour and the Shape\" album was released as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games on November 13, 2008.\n\nThe original album version was created in December 1996 at WGNS Studios in Washington, D.C., in between recording sessions for \"The Colour and the Shape.\" It was performed by Grohl on vocals (in one take) and all instrument parts (except bass, which was performed by the band's bassist Nate Mendel), and was recorded by Geoff Turner.\n\nThe soundtrack/single version was performed by the full band, including then-recent additions Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, with guest backing vocals from Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren. It was recorded in early 1998 at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood, and was produced by Talking Heads member Jerry Harrison. As a result of trying to muster as much emotion as possible, Grohl broke down during the recording of the vocal take which ended up being used in the final mix. This version also utilizes the addition of a piano part during the bridge, performed by Harrison. Stylistically, it employs more intricate drumming and guitar work than the original—which is much more sparse—and runs about a minute shorter.\n\nThe song's music video features a nattily-attired Grohl interacting with a woman (played by Spanish actress Arly Jover) in what appears to be an asylum or prison, where the two are separated by plate-glass windows. A stack of vintage television sets displays clips of retro fare such as Bela Lugosi films and Betty Boop cartoons.\n\nIt was directed by fashion photographer Matthew Rolston, who had also done videos for artists such as Janet Jackson, Madonna, and Lenny Kravitz. \n\nBefore Rolston's involvement in the video, \"X-Files\" star David Duchovny had expressed an interest in directing it, but was quick to admit his inexperience, saying \"I wouldn't know what the hell I'm doing.\" The concept was also initially considered to have more of a direct relation to \"The X-Files\" in some way, which the finished video does not bear.\n\nThe previously unreleased Ween song \"Beacon Light\" was used as a B-side as it also appears on the film soundtrack to \"X-Files: Fight the Future\".\n\n\n"}

He was born at Roxwell, Essex, and was a student of the Middle Temple. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for a number of constituencies including Maldon (1601–1603), Midhurst (in the parliament of 1604-1611), Essex (in the Addled Parliament of 1614), Arundel (1622), Bossiney (1624), Callington (1625) and Bodmin (1626). He was knighted in 1603.\n\nDuring the reign of King James I of England, Weston was sent on embassies to Bohemia, Brussels, and Spain. On the last assignment, he negotiated for the restitution of the Palatine. Upon his return to England in 1621, he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, and retained the post after the accession of Charles I; he proved a capable financial manager but incurred popular hatred as a (justly) suspected Roman Catholic, while also later earning the enmity of the (Catholic) queen, Henrietta Maria for refusing grants to her favourites. He opposed wars with Spain in 1623 and France in 1626, but managed to find ways of raising the money to fund them when required, even when it was impossible to secure the co-operation of Parliament.\n\nWeston was elevated to the peerage on 13 April 1628 as Baron Weston of Nayland in Suffolk. He was subsequently made Lord Treasurer of England and invested with the Order of the Garter. His policies proving highly unpopular, he escaped impeachment in 1629 only by the dissolution of Parliament. Nevertheless, he played an important role in the King's Personal Rule without Parliament, finding new sources of revenue while preventing any further increase in the King's expenditure, and being for a time the most influential of Charles's advisers. He persuaded the King to make peace with France in 1629 and Spain in 1630, removing the biggest drain on the treasury, and to sign the secret treaty with Spain in 1634. By the time he died in 1635, the Crown was solvent.\n\nOn 17 February 1633, Weston was created Earl of Portland. Lord Portland was married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth Pincheon of Writtle in Essex. His second wife was Frances Waldegrave of Borley in Essex. He had three children by his first marriage, including Lady Mary Weston (2 January 1603-after August 1678), who married the 2nd Lord Aston of Forfar in 1629, and Lady Elizabeth Weston, who married John Netterville, 2nd Viscount Netterville. He had seven children by his second marriage, including his son Thomas, who later succeeded as 4th Earl, and Lady Anne Weston, the first of the four wives of Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh. His nephew (his sister's son), Jeremy Clarke, became a Governor of Rhode Island in the American colonies.\n\nOn his death, he was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, Jerome.\n\n"}
{"id": "2289431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289431", "title": "Leoba", "text": "Leoba\n\nLeoba (also Lioba and Leofgyth) (c. 710 – 28 September 782) was an Anglo-Saxon Benedictine nun and is recognized as a saint. In 746 she and others left Wimborne Minster in Dorset to join her kinsman Boniface in his mission to the German people. She was a learned woman and was involved in the foundation of nunneries in Kitzingen and Ochsenfurt. She had a leading role in evangelizing the area. Leoba was acclaimed for many miracles: saving a village from fire; saving a town from a terrible storm; protecting the reputation of the nuns in her convent; and saving the life of a fellow nun who was gravely ill; all accomplished through prayer.\n\nShe was born Leofgyth in Wessex to a noble family, the only child of elderly parents, Dynne and Æbbe. Her mother was related to Boniface, and Boniface was a friend of her father's. Her mother had a dream in which she would conceive \"the chosen/ beloved\" child of Christ. This dream also told her mother that her offspring was to lead a spiritual life, and to serve the church. The name \"Leob\" means \"greatly loved\", with \"Leofgyth\" being from Old Engish \"léof\" or \"líof\" 'beloved, dear' and \"gýþ\" or \"gúþ\" 'battle'.\n\nIt is said that Leofgyth was trained first by abbess Edburga at Minster-in-Thanet, but Catherine Wynbourne says the evidence for this is slight, although Leoba may have periodically visited Thanet.\n\nShe entered the double monastery of Wimborne Minster as an oblate and was entrusted to the care Abbess Tetta. Later, Leoba entered the community as a nun. The nuns of Wimbourne were skilled at copying and ornamenting manuscripts; and celebrated for Opus Anglicanum, a fine needlework often using gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen, often decorated with jewels and pearls. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe.\n\nWillibald indicates that nuns as well as monks attended Winfred/Boniface's lectures at Nhutscelle, which was not far from Wimbourne. Boniface maintained correspondence with a number of religious houses in Britain. Lioba wrote Boniface requesting prayers for her parents. Some years later, he decided to invite some nuns to come from England to establish themselves in various parts of the country. To this end he sent a letter to Abbess Tetta requesting that she send Leoba, and others to assist with his mission of spreading Christianity in Germany.\n\nBoniface specifically requested Leoba because he thought that many would benefit from her holiness and example. Leoba once experienced a dream in which a purple thread was coming from her mouth. She pulled the thread repeatedly until she rolled it into a ball. The labor of this caused her extreme fatigue and resulted in her waking up from her dream. Out of curiosity, she employed a fellow nun to seek out a nun who was known to reveal prophecies. This nun listened to the explanation of the dream and said that this dream represented the life of leadership that Leoba was to live and that she was destined to be a wise teacher and a great counselor. In 748, Leoba, together with Thecla and others, traveled to Germany to aid Boniface in his apostolic labours.\n\nBoniface established a convent in the Franconian town Tauberbischofsheim, where she became the abbess. He entrusted her with a great deal of authority, and Rudolf of Fulda indicates that she was not merely in charge of her own house, but all of the nuns who worked with Boniface. In 754, when Boniface was preparing a missionary trip to Frisia, he gave his monastic cowl to Leoba to indicate that, when he was away, she was his delegate.\n\nShe was a learned woman, and in the following years she was involved in the foundation of nunneries in Kitzingen and Ochsenfurt. She had a leading role in evangelizing her area, and, during her life, she was credited with quelling a storm with her command. Additionally, bishops in Fulda consulted her, and she was the only woman allowed to enter into monasteries in Fulda to consult the ecclesiastical leaders on issues of monastic rule. She was also favoured in the court of Pippin III, and Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne, was her friend.\n\nIn her later years, she retired with a few other Anglo-Saxon nuns to an estate near Mainz in Schornsheim. The estate was given by Charlemagne for her exclusive use. She died on 28 September 782. Boniface's will had originally designated that Leoba was to be buried in his own tomb. When Leoba died, she was placed in a tomb near his.\n\nLeoba was acclaimed for many miracles: saving a village from fire; saving a town from a terrible storm, protecting the reputation of the nuns in her convent; and saving the life of a fellow nun who was gravely ill; all accomplished through prayer. According to Rudolf of Fulda, Leoba's grave was the site of many miracles. These miracles include: freeing a man of tightly bound iron rings around his arms; and curing a man from Spain of his twitching disorder. Due to these miracles, some of which were witnessed by Rudolf, Leoba's relics were translated twice to ensure their safety. \n\nSeveral miracles were attributed to her intercession, and she was recognized as a saint. Her relics were translated twice and are now behind an altar in a church dedicated to Mary and the virgins of Christ in Petersburg in Fulda. Some fifty years after her death, Rudolf of Fulda was commissioned to write the \"acta\" of her life (\"Vita Leobae\") in connection with this second translation of relics.\n\nHer feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is 28 September. A beer and mushroom soup is named for St. Leoba. \n\n"}
{"id": "2289437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289437", "title": "Six Flags New Orleans", "text": "Six Flags New Orleans\n\nSix Flags New Orleans (SFNO) is a 140-acre, abandoned theme park in New Orleans. It first opened in 2000, but has been closed since it was seriously damaged by flooding during Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. It is currently owned by the Industrial Development Board (IDB) of New Orleans. Six Flags had leased the park from 2002 until 2009, when the lease was terminated during its bankruptcy proceedings. The former park is located in New Orleans East off Interstate 10.\n\nDespite various proposals to redevelop the site, it has remained abandoned, overgrown with plants, infested with wildlife and in poor condition. Trespassing is prohibited. Despite these deterrents, videos and photos of the site have surfaced over the years from thrill-seekers and YouTube users. As a result, city officials became more diligent in securing the park and banning tours.\n\nIn July 2019, mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that the New Orleans government would explore the possibility of demolishing the site. This idea stemmed from reports that the park's wildlife and overall condition had been disturbing local residents. An analysis estimated that it would cost around $1.3 million to demolish the park.\n\nThe city generates money for itself by leasing the park on-and-off as a filming location to various production companies.\n\nThe park opened under the name Jazzland in 2000. It was operated by Alfa Smartparks (later Odgen Entertainment and now known as Palace Entertainment), but owned by a Spanish company called Parques Reunidos. Rides included Mega Zeph, a wooden roller coaster track built on a steel frame to prevent termite infestation and withstand hurricane-force winds. Mega Zeph was inspired by the old Zephyr roller coaster at the closed Pontchartrain Beach Amusement Park that was located next to Lake Pontchartrain by the University of New Orleans. The intent was to rebuild the Zephyr, but it was a smaller roller coaster, so that idea was scrapped in favor of the current larger Mega Zeph. Other rides included a junior steel coaster called Rex's Rail Runner, a wild mouse steel coaster and a common steel shuttle looping Vekoma boomerang rollercoaster called a Zydeco Scream. The park had a log flume called Cypress Plunge and a splashwater falls ride called Spillway Splashout. In addition, the park had common amusement park spinning rides and a carousel merry-go-round. The park was not profitable, as Alpha Smart Parks specialized in running water parks and smaller amusement arcade centers. In 2001, the lease was put up for sale, and in March 2002 Six Flags purchased the lease, although the park's name did not change that year.\n\nIn early 2003, Six Flags upgraded the park and renamed it Six Flags New Orleans. Six Flags added more shaded areas and many new flat spinning rides. The park was renamed Six Flags, and the \"it's playtime!\" theme was adopted that included a dancing old man, Mr. Six. They added a Bolliger & Mabillard inverted coaster named (a mirrored version of the B&M Batman: The Ride coaster model) relocated from the defunct Thrill Valley in Japan, and a Vekoma multiple looping coaster called The Jester relocated from Six Flags Fiesta Texas. A water park that would be included in the admission (like Six Flags Parks such as Six Flags St. Louis and Six Flags America, for example) was in the planning stages in early 2005 and was going to be announced at the end of August. However, Hurricane Katrina was about to strike New Orleans, which put those plans and the continued operations of the park in question. The last day the park operated was August 21, 2005, eight days before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Weekday operations had ended a couple of weeks earlier, as schools start early in August in the New Orleans area and end in mid-May. The park was scheduled to reopen on August 27 or August 28, but once Katrina was forecast late on Friday, August 26 to directly hit New Orleans, the weekend re-opening was cancelled in order to prepare for the storm and begin evacuations.\n\n\nBecause the park was located next to Lake Pontchartrain, the park installed drainage pipes to protect it from flooding. Then on the morning of August 29, 2005, just after sunrise, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. New Orleans suffered $70 billion in damages as many people stayed at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and up to 1,464 people died in New Orleans. Over 80% of New Orleans was flooded.\n\nAt the park, the water from Lake Pontchartrain overflowed onto the theme park after the park's drainage pipes failed to keep up with the flow of water and flooded the entire park for the duration of Katrina. After Katrina left New Orleans, the park was submerged deep. It took over a month for the water to leave the park, leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nThe park grounds are located on a low-lying section of Eastern New Orleans, with a earthen flood berm running along the perimeter, creating an artificial basin. As such, this area was heavily flooded in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. After the park's drainage pumps failed during the storm, the berm retained the combination of rainwater and sea water overflow from Lake Pontchartrain caused by Katrina's massive storm surge, submerging the entire park grounds in corrosive, brackish floodwater to a depth of for over a month. Due to the extensive water and wind damage received, the park was closed indefinitely without plans to reopen.\nInitial damage reports by Six Flags inspectors stated that the park buildings were 80% demolished, all of the flat rides (except for one which was being serviced off-site at the time of the storm) were effectively destroyed by long term salt-water immersion and both the wooden track and steel superstructure of the Mega Zeph were likely damaged beyond repair. The only large ride to escape relatively unscathed was the \"Batman: The Ride\" roller-coaster, due to its elevated station platform and corrosion-resistant support structure.\nOn July 1, 2006, having announced that the park would be closed \"at least\" through 2007, Six Flags announced that it had concluded its damage assessments and declared the park to be an \"effective total loss\"—with no desire or intent by the company to undertake the prohibitive cost of rebuilding—and was in negotiations with the City of New Orleans to make an early exit from the 75-year lease which Six Flags entered into on the property in 2002. However, then-Mayor Ray Nagin said he planned to hold Six Flags to the lease agreement and force them to rebuild. If held to the terms of the lease agreement, Six Flags would have been legally obligated to rebuild the park on the same site, but only to the extent of the insurance money Six Flags received. Six Flags determined the value of assets destroyed by the storm at $32.5 million. As of September 2006, Six Flags had collected $11.5 million of insurance proceeds, bringing the insurance receivable balance to $24.4 million. In January 2007, Six Flags officials revealed to the New Orleans \"Times-Picayune\" that the company was suing its insurers for the remaining $17.5 million in coverage.\nThe park had been one of the least profitable parks in the Six Flags portfolio. Though the park was located in New Orleans East near some of the area's more affluent neighborhoods, the park was originally budgeted to bring in tourists from the city's downtown attractions to supplement the city's relatively smaller population base (New Orleans had been experiencing a declining population before Hurricane Katrina). However, near the time that the storm struck, Six Flags had already begun closing some of its smaller, less profitable parks across the country. Hurricane Katrina cemented the New Orleans park as another of Six Flags' portfolio that would eventually close permanently.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, Six Flags confirmed that it was removing \"Batman: The Ride\" for refurbishment and relocation to a new park, as it was considered to be the only salvageable ride. \"Batman: The Ride\" was reassembled at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio and opened under the new name \"Goliath\" on April 18, 2008. In addition to \"Batman: The Ride\", Six Flags removed shade coverings, ride parts, lights, security cameras, planting structures and various other salvageable items.\n\nBesides \"Batman: The Ride\", other rides were later removed from the park. \"Bayou Blaster\" and \"Sonic Slam\" were removed in 2008 and taken to Great Escape in Queensbury, New York, where the ride was refurbished and reopened under the name \"Sasquatch\" on May 10, 2009. The \"Road Runner Express\" was removed in 2009 and taken to Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, where it was refurbished and reopened on May 28, 2011 under the same name.\n\nAs late as the fall of 2009, the Six Flags website said the company was \"still in the process of settling claims with its insurers due to substantial damage caused by Hurricane Katrina,\" adding that the park would remain closed. The statement ended with \"We know that it is still a difficult time for the residents of New Orleans and we remain committed to working with the city in support of the recovery efforts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2008, Southern Star Amusement Inc. proposed to take over the site lease from the then-owner Six Flags, promising to expand the park to over 60 rides (more than double its pre-Katrina size), complete a water park that Six Flags had been planning, and add an RV park. Southern Star Amusement Inc. pledged to open the park as Legend City Adventure Park, with 60 rides in place, including a new water park by the summer of 2009 if the city approved the lease takeover, with the campground to follow. One issue concerning rebuilding was Six Flags' continued removal of infrastructure from the park. In a quarterly conference call Six Flags discussed plans to remove the S&S Towers by 2009 with more ride removals to follow. Items from existing Jazzland rides, such as Mega Zeph's trains and Spillway Splashout's boats, were sent to other parks. On September 27, 2008, Southern Star stated on its website that it would no longer be trying to revive Six Flags New Orleans.\n\nIn February 2009, Southern Star was taking another look at the park and considering a takeover bid with the City of New Orleans. Southern Star planned a scaled down effort, with intentions only to reopen the park with a water park added within the existing midway area. The idea was to reopen and build incrementally, saving about $50 million in improvements for the next few years. Given the poor economic situation at the time, this plan seemed to be the only way that the park could be saved. The basic idea was to use investors and Go Zone Bonds to raise the $35 to $40 million needed to just reopen the park with basic improvements that are needed to make a real recovery and profit. Southern Star's CEO Danny R. Rogers asked that Six Flags stop all removal action of equipment from the park, as the equipment in question belongs to the City of New Orleans and not Six Flags. The return of other equipment taken from the park by Six Flags was also requested.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, it was announced that the land would be redeveloped into a Nickelodeon Universe theme/water park.\n\nOn September 18, 2009, the city of New Orleans fined Six Flags $3 million and ordered the park to vacate its lease. (On June 13, 2009, the Six Flags had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.)\n\nAs of early 2010, the site was overgrown with debris and weeds. Removal of the debris and underbrush had begun.\n\nAs of April 11, 2010, the site was still shut down with no clear future, since the city of New Orleans owned the property by this time and the plans for the Nickelodeon-branded theme park fell through three months after bonds failed to come through.\n\nOn January 21, 2011, Southern Star went public with its third redevelopment plans for the park, posting a link on their company website. On January 26, 2011, Southern Star posted a Letter of Intent for the park on its website. The redevelopment plans gave a brief history of the property, pre and post-Katrina condition photos, development concept photos, written descriptions of each phase of the redevelopment procedure and business projections for when it opens. During \"Phase I\", Southern Star planned to restore what is left of the park, and expand it by adding more rides and reverting the park back to its original Louisiana theme. The park would be revamped to reflect Louisiana's history and heritage, with one of the proposed sections paying tribute to the now defunct Pontchartrain Beach, which closed in 1983. \"Phase II\" entailed adding a water park and future expansion phases included adding a youth sports complex, an on-site hotel/resort and a movie studio/backlot that would cater to the needs of various production companies filming in the New Orleans area. Plans also included developing an entertainment and shopping district within the park. These plans entailed utilizing all of the site of which only were to be developed and occupied by the remains of the Six Flags New Orleans park. The Letter of Intent from Southern Star set out a lease agreement between the city and the company stating Southern Star's proposed terms of the lease and its intent for utilizing and restoring the area. The company would enter a 75-year lease and take on the property in its current condition. Southern Star planned to take possession of the property prior to the establishment of the lease in order to provide preliminary security and repair/cleanup services. The lease would not have taken effect until Southern Star had taken possession of the property, started the cleanup process and provided proof of funding to the city. After that, the city had 15 days to execute its end of the agreement. Any and all improvements made would belong to the company and the lease would end in the year 2018. The plans never came to fruition, however.\n\nIn August 2011, the city of New Orleans called for proposals for redevelopment ideas for the site. Eight entrepreneurs stepped forward to suggest turning the property into a power plant, a theme park, or even an outlet mall. On November 29, 2011, the city of New Orleans chose two of the proposed projects: an outlet mall and a green theme park. On February 6, 2012, it was reported that the selection committee rejected the plan for the site of Six Flags New Orleans to become a theme park, leaving the upscale outlet mall as the only proposal being considered by the committee. Despite the committee's actions, one of the original eight entrepreneurs continued to try to get public support for their Jazzland Park proposal, which includes the addition of a water park and movie studio back lot.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, the city of New Orleans gave the green light to build Jazzland Outlet Mall to Provident Realty Advisors and DAG Development. The proposal was for a upscale outlet mall and entertainment boardwalk on the former theme park site, costing $40 million for part of Phase One and using some of the existing rides from the theme park. Construction would have taken between three and four years. During the planned period of due diligence and pre-construction, in March 2013 the development plans were abruptly called off. The developer cited competition from the planned expansion of Riverwalk Marketplace to include an outlet mall, making the Jazzland Outlet Mall concept unviable. However, as of the summer of 2013, Provident Realty Advisors and DAG Development has been back at the negotiating table with the city to come up with a new idea for the park; they will have to present a development plan to the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in October 2013, according to a contract. Once presented IDB will then accept or reject the proposal. The contract also states that construction of an outlet mall is to proceed, but it does not explicitly prohibit giving the developers an opportunity to put something else there.\n\nIn 2011, \"Killer Joe\" was filmed in the park featuring the wooden coaster Mega Zeph. \"Stolen\" was also filmed at the park that year. \"Stolen\" used the Main Street Square section to double as the Quarter. Additionally, a burning car was driven into the lagoon and the \"Orpheum Theatre\" was used as the home of the film's villain.\n\nThe Industrial Development Board (IDB) agreed to let 20th Century Fox film the 2013 film \"\" in the theme park during the summer of 2012 through August. \"Mega Zeph\", \"Ozarka Splash\" and \"The Big Easy\" are three rides that have been shot for the film along with five other rides that the production crew had brought into the park, since all the original rides were rendered inoperable to shoot for the film. Before shooting at the park for five weeks, the production crew took two weeks to restore the derelict park into the needed condition by installing lighting and covering up graffiti on the buildings. The park portrays the fictional \"Circeland\" on the island of Polyphemus that was built by the goddess Circe, only to be destroyed by the cyclops Polyphemus.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, portions of the park were being filmed for the movie \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" until mid-August. The park was also used to film portions of the movie \"Jurassic World\" in June 2014.\n\n\"Jurassic World\" used the parking lot as the location for the Jurassic World park. \"Deepwater Horizon\" built its oil rig set in the parking lot.\n\nDeepwater Horizon was the last film to use the parking lot. No movie studio has signed up to use the park for filming since August 2015.\n\nIn January 2015, the park was photographed as part of a photo essay/series by Cleveland-based photographer Johnny Joo. In this series, Joo documented the abandoned or historic structures of New Orleans, which still remained 10 years after Hurricane Katrina. He also documented portions of revitalization in the community of New Orleans to show how the area has been rebuilt after one of the largest natural disasters in United States history.\n\nIn 2016, the video game \"Mafia III\", is set in a fictional version of New Orleans. The abandoned amusement park in that game features a partially flooded site, a similar entranceway, and a roller-coaster which strongly resembles the Mega Zeph.\n\nIn 2019, rapper NF used parts of the park for his music video for \"Leave Me Alone.\"\n\nIn 2016, a group that included the former head of Southern Star came together to form \"Dreamlanding Festival Park\" in order to buy and rebuild this park, pending city council/mayoral approval. According to their website, the group was ready to spend over $100 million to re-open the park, with construction scheduled to begin in the summer of 2018, a stated opening date of 2019 and more coasters ready for 2020. At the same time, a waterpark would open in spring 2019. A festival park and an RV site were also in their plans as they awaited the city's approval to purchase the park.\n\nIn 2018, on the Dreamlanding Festival Park website, the following statement was released: \"It is very hard to walk away from all the time and efforts we have put into New Orleans but in truth the old Jazzland /Six Flags park has now reached a point of no return. On our last inspection and after further review we find that the Rides that were savable as well as the majority of buildings are no longer economically viable to salvage.\"\n\nIn 2011, eight groups, including the Paidia Company, responded to an RFP issued by the Mayor's office. Paidia proposed to re-open the park as Jazzland, the park's name until 2002. The company was not selected during the first RFP. A second RFP was issued in January 2014. Jazzland submitted the only proposal. The plans include newly designed themes for the park, a new Baritone Beach water park, Sportsman's Paradise Resort Hotel and a mixed-use retail/dining/entertainment area. A few rides would be rebuilt, but most would be new. A \"Sportsman's Paradise\" section would include the existing Jester coaster, the \"Beach\" would include Megazeph. Ozarka Splash would be rebuilt as a \"sugar flume\", using the state's sugar cane industry for its theme. In February 2017, the company submitted a purchase offer for the property. In May 2017, the IDB voted to turn over decision making power to the Mayor's office. In June 2018 the IDB renewed the cooperative agreement with the new Mayor, keeping the decision power with the mayor's office. Jazzland maintains its interest in purchasing the property.\n\n"}

The appellation is generally, but not only, applied to certain movements within Ashkenazic Orthodox Judaism, and used by some members of these groups as a self-reference.\n\nThe term connotes the observance of Jewish religious law in a way that often exceeds its bare requirements. This not only includes the careful study of Torah, daily prayers, observing Shabbat and kashrut, and performing deeds of loving-kindness, but also many more customs and \"khumrot\" (prohibitions or obligations in Jewish life that exceed the requirements of Halakha).\n\nThe term \"frum\" contrasts with \"frei\" (Yiddish and German for 'free'), which describes Jews who are secular or practice non-Orthodox observance, or \"free from keeping the ... commandments.\"\n\n\"Frum\" can be used in a negative sense for 'hypocritically pious', 'holier-than-thou', 'sanctimonious'; or in a positive sense for 'pious', 'devout', 'God-fearing', and 'upright'. The phrase \"frum and ehrlich\" captures the positive connotations of these words, to mean roughly 'upright' or 'righteous' (see \"tzadik\").\n\nThe question \"is s/he \"frum\"?\" asks whether the person is religious.\n\nIn Yinglish, \"frummer\" is used both as a noun for 'one who is frum', and as a comparative adjective, i.e. 'more frum'. The correct Yiddish comparative form of the adjective is, in fact, . \"Frumkeit\" describes the lifestyle of those who are frum.\n\n\"Frummer\" can also have a negative connotation, similar to \"chasid shoteh\" ('pious idiot'), which is how the Talmud (Sotah 21B) describes a man who sees a woman drowning, but refuses to save her, and says, \"It is not proper to look at her, and rescue her.\" A \"frummer\" in that sense is a person displaying a disproportionate emphasis on technical aspects of religion of one's daily life in a manner which actually violates the \"halakha\" in a specific case. (See Pikuach nefesh.) Another term with this meaning is \"frummie\".\n\nA person who is \"frum from birth\" was born into a frum household and has remained observant. This contrasts with a \"baal teshuva\" (literally 'master of return'), a Jew who has become frum after a period or lifetime living a non-Orthodox lifestyle.\n\n\"The New York Times\" defines the word \"frum\" as 'religiously observant'. For boys and men, covering the head is an identifier of religiosity. For women, being frum includes adherence to the laws of tzniut, such as modest dress covering the arms and legs. For married women, a head covering is another indicator.\n\n"}

This cargo is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car/railway wagon, or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered \"bulk\") can be boxed (or drummed) and palletised. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.\n\nThe Baltic Exchange is based in London and provides a range of indices benchmarking the cost of moving bulk commodities, dry and wet, along popular routes around the seas. Some of these indices are also used to settle Freight Futures, known as FFA's. The most famous of the Baltic indices is the Baltic Dry Indices, commonly called the BDI. This is a derived function of the Baltic Capesize index (BCI), Baltic Panamax index (BPI), Baltic Supramax index (BSI) and the Baltic Handysize index (BHSI). The BDI has been used as a bellwether for the global economy as it can be interpreted as an indicator of an increase or decrease in the amount of raw commodities countries are importing/exporting.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Others, such as Ruth Mitchell and Mary Taylor, have said writers and speakers actually can target their communication to address a real audience. Some others, such as Ede and Lunsford, try to mingle these two approaches and create situations where audience is \"fictionalized\", as Ong would say, but in recognition of some real attributes of the actual audience.\n\nThere is also a wide range of media studies and communication studies theories about the audience's role in any kind of mediated communication. A sub-culturally focussed and Marxism-inflected take on the subject arose as the \"new audience theory\" or \"active audience theory\" from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies during the 1980s.\n\n\nEarly research into media audiences was dominated by the debate about \"media effects\", in particular the link between screen violence and real-life aggression. Several moral panics fuelled the claims, such as the incorrect presumptions that \"Rambo\" had influenced Michael Robert Ryan to commit the Hungerford massacre, and that \"Child's Play 3\" had motivated the killers of James Bulger.\n\nIn the 1990s, David Gauntlett published critiques on media \"effects\", most notably the \"Ten things wrong with the media effects model\" article. Then, in the 2000s, he sought to develop new methods which would explore possible media influences using \"creative\" approaches, in which participants were asked to make things such as collage, video, drawings, and Lego models using metaphors.\n\nFrom the 1970s, researchers from the CCCS produced empirical research about the relationship between texts and audiences. Amongst these was \"The Nationwide Project\" by David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon.\n\nStuart Hall's encoding/decoding model can be seen as the beginning of research into how audiences are active consumers rather than passive recipients.\n\n\n"}

Produced by John Shanks, the album was recorded at Sanctuary Sound II in New Jersey, and Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California.\n\n\"Have A Nice Day\" was originally recorded in the summer of 2004 and planned for release in early 2005. However, due to misunderstandings between the band and its record company, the album was delayed. The band wanted to write and record more songs, remove others from the original track list, and in the process, altered existing album tracks.\n\n\"Have A Nice Day\" ranked number one in its debut, in 15 countries. The album also ranked No.2 in both the US and UK. In the US, it sold over 202,000 copies in the first week, making it Bon Jovi's best first-week sales in the band's history at that time. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe album produced the hit singles \"Have a Nice Day\" and \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\". \"Have a Nice Day\" has mostly received mixed reviews by music critics. It was commonly commented that Jon Bon Jovi was \"stretching\" his lyrical abilities.\n\nJon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora headed into the studio with producer and songwriter John Shanks in summer of 2004. to begin working on a band's ninth studio album. They started to write songs and songs came very quick. After Jon and Richie co-wrote all the songs with Shanks, they recorded them immediately using a drum machine. Sambora and Shanks played all the guitar parts, Jon recorded all the vocals and there were no bass player or drummer in the studio. Later in the recording sessions, David Bryan, Tico Torres and Hugh McDonald recorded their parts. In the meantime, the band was doing finishing touches on their boxset \"100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong\" (2004). Jon planned to turn the album over to record company right before Christmas of 2004., but he changed his mind. In December 2004, he went to Sanctuary Sound Studio to write more songs. When the band regrouped in 2005, they recorded four more songs and also worked on the revised versions of the original songs.\n\nLyrical themes talk about political changes that happened in United States in that period and the state of music business, but also reflect personal and introspective views on issues that Jon Bon Jovi had while growing up and about which he never discussed before. He said: \"I've always kept this 'chin up, glass is half-full' kind of optimism, and [now] I showed some chinks in the armor.\" \"The song \"Last Man Standing\" depicts the band leader's unhappiness with the music industry. He says it reflects his \"disgust of the music business in general, and its lack of true vision when it comes to supporting the artistry of developing a song, the songwriter and the bands on the road.\"\" He explained: \"Instead of creating what Andy Warhol once called '15 minutes of fame,' I think it's down to just three minutes and 30 seconds,\" he says. \"I don't know how this industry is ever going to have another Bob Dylan when it's all about the single, [not] the album and the vision and that inspiration. [It's] all for the sake of a 99-cent download so they can sell bulk and make their bonuses. It's heartbreaking.\"\n\nAlbum tracklisting, release dates for United States and Canada, and radio release date for the first single were announced on July 14, 2005. First single, the title track \"Have a Nice Day\" premiered on radio stations worldwide on July 18, 2005. On September 2, 2005. it was announced that full length version of the song \"Last Man Standing\" is available for listening in discography section on their official website.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine gave \"Have a Nice Day\" 2.5 stars out of 5, saying that the album \"picks up where 2002's \"Bounce\" left off, showcasing a harder, heavier band than either 2000's \"Crush\" or Jon Bon Jovi's 1997 solo effort, \"Destination Anywhere\". Not only that, but this 2005 album finds Jon Bon Jovi picking up on the serious undercurrent of Bounce, writing a series of angry, somber neo-protest songs that form the heart of this record.\" Blogcritics gave the album 8 stars out of 10 stating that \"while their glory days are behind them, there's still a lot left in the tank for Bon Jovi when they want to be a band. The chemistry between Jon and Richie is as strong as ever, and the songwriting prowess they have is a well that never seems to run dry for these guys. While not their best work, this is their best in a long time.\" Robert Christgau gave the album a grade of C+, stating that it is \"A depressing argument for the existence of that intellectual fairy tale, the passive mass audience.\" Christian Hoard from \"Rolling Stone\" gave the album 3 stars out of 5 saying that it is \"reliable as it is contained: Acoustic ballads such as 'Bells of Freedom' are vaguely icky, but powerhouse anthems like 'I Want to Be Loved' pack almost as much singalong potential as 'Livin' on a Prayer' did back in the day.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2289465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289465", "title": "Worldcentrism", "text": "Worldcentrism\n\nThe American integral philosopher Ken Wilber uses the term worldcentric to describe an advanced stage of ethical development. This involves a broadening of the spiritual horizon through the formulation of a transpersonal ethic in which we do not only desire the best for all people but for all living beings. It is this aspect where worldcentrism is viewed as an expansion of sociocentrism where one focuses beyond self-needs to also extend care about the group, community, and society. The idea is that worldcentrism situates the positive aspects of egocentrism and sociocentrism in a larger context of concern so that consideration does not only include one's self or one's people but all peoples and all beings. Synonyms of \"worldcentric\" include \"global\" and \"planetary\". \n\nThere are also worldcentrists who maintain that living beings engage in autopoiesis (self-making, self-producing, and self-repairing), which renders these beings as ends-in-themselves and of equal ground value, in addition to whatever extrinsic or intrinsic value they possess.\n\nWilber also sometimes refers to an ethical stage that is beyond the worldcentric, which he calls \"kosmocentric\". In a \"kosmocentric\" awareness, one experiences a release of attachments of the gross realm and a radical recognition of evolutionary processes so that an individual is compassionately called to action and becomes capable of letting the gravity of outcomes go. Wilber used to associate these advanced ethical stages with mystical states, but since 2002 he has associated these advanced ethical stages with the development of complexity in the self-related lines of identity, studied by Susanne Cook-Greuter. (See \"Integral Spirituality,\" Ken Wilber; See also \"Transcendence and Mature Thought in Adulthood,\" Susanne Cook-Greuter.)\n\n"}

The song reached #17 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #7 Adult Contemporary. It was a very minor hit in Canada (#91). After the band broke up in 1982, he rejoined the Earth Band.\n\nIn 1980, he co-wrote and sang backing vocals on the track \"No Stoppin' Us Now\" with Patrick Simmons and Michael McDonald, on the Doobie Brothers' album \"One Step Closer\". In 1983 he contributed vocals to Simmons' solo album \"Arcade\" as well as co-writing several of the tracks.\n\nIn 1981, Thompson released his debut album, \"Out of the Night\". This was followed by five more albums, most recently \"Won't Lie Down\" in 2001.\n\nIn 1984, while functional lead singer for the re-formed Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Thompson lent lead vocals to \"Runner,\" which slowly climbed to become a USA and UK top 30 hit, propelled by then-hot MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1986, Thompson was one of the four co-writers of the hit song \"You're the Voice\" - the others being Andy Qunta of Australian new wave outfit Icehouse, erstwhile Procol Harum lyricist Keith Reid and Maggie Ryder. He hoped to record the song in London but was turned down by record companies there who stated the song was \"not commercial\". He sent a demo to John Farnham, who had recently come off a five-year stint fronting the Little River Band. Farnham liked the song and agreed to record it for his forthcoming album, \"Whispering Jack\". Farnham's release of \"You're the Voice\" was a worldwide hit, reaching top ten positions in many countries across the world.\n\nAlso in 1986, Thompson sang vocals on a solo album by ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. The album featured performances by artists such as Brian May (Queen), Pete Trewavas (Marillion), Ian Mosley (also from Marillion), and Bonnie Tyler. However, the album, entitled \"Feedback 86\", was not released until 2002.\n\nIn spite of his already busy schedule in 1986, Thompson still found the time to return to Manfred Mann for their new album, \"Criminal Tango\", in addition to putting out some solo material. He recorded the song \"It's Not Over\" for the soundtrack to the film \"Playing for Keeps\", and this track was also featured (with a slightly longer fade-out) on his new solo album, \"High Cost of Living\", released later the same year. The following year, \"It's Not Over\" would be re-recorded by Starship, becoming a top-ten hit for the group.\n\nIn 1989, Thompson recorded the single \"The Challenge (Face It)\" as the official theme song for the 1989 Wimbledon Tennis Championships. He co-wrote the song with Harold Faltermeyer. A year later, in 1990, Thompson worked again with Faltermeyer in writing the 1990 song for Wimbledon, \"Hold the Dream\" by Franzisca.\n\nAlso in 1990, Thompson recorded the single \"This Is The Moment\" as the official theme song for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland.\n\nIn 1992, Thompson performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert as a backing musician, harmonising with respected backing vocalists Maggie Ryder and Miriam Stockley. He also joined The Brian May Band for their South American tour the same year.\n\nIn 1995, Thompson performed \"You're The Voice\" in the Netherlands at the World Liberty Concert as the grand finale of the event. He also sang a studio version of it on the Alan Parsons \"The Very Best Live\" album (1995).\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, he joined Jeff Wayne for a second time to tour as The Voice of Humanity in the live version of \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\". According to the special features of the DVD \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds - Live on Stage\", Thompson designed some artwork for the show.\n\nThompson has been featured on several albums by artists such as Alan Parsons, Jan Hammer, Steve Hackett, Bonnie Tyler, Mike Oldfield, and Sarah Brightman, as well as providing backing vocals for Brian May of Queen, during his first few solo concerts in South America in 1992.\n\nThompson has also been involved with the SAS Band (Spike's All Star Band) where he has performed numerous songs, especially from his repertoire with Manfred Mann's Earth Band.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its bioluminescence is produced throughout the cytoplasm of this single-celled protist, by a luciferin-luciferase reaction in thousands of spherically shaped organelles, called scintillons.\n\n\"N. scintillans\" is large for a dinoflagellate with a diameter of , though most are around . It has a ventral groove that holds a flagellum, an extension of the cell wall called a tooth, and a striated tentacle involved in ingestion that projects posteriorly. The flagellum does not move the organism, so the nonmotile \"N. scintillans\" depends on regulation of its buoyancy within the water column – perhaps by controlling its cellular concentration of ions and ammonia.\n\n\"N. scintillans\" produces a string of mucus extending from the tip of the tentacle which then adheres to plankton and ascends rapidly through concentrations of its prey in the water column.\n\n\"N. scintillans\" is a heterotroph that engulfs, by phagocytosis, food which includes plankton, diatoms, other dinoflagellates, fish eggs, and bacteria. Diatoms are often found in the vacuoles within these single-celled creatures. These green nonfeeding symbioses can grow photoautotrophically for generations. Diatoms of \"Thalassiosira\" have been noted as a favored food source of these organisms.\n\n\"N. scintillans\" can be found widely distributed throughout the world, often along the coast, in estuaries, and shallow areas of the continental shelf that receive plenty of light, which promotes the growth of the phytoplankton that make up a large portion of the \"N. scintillans\" diet.\n\n\"Noctiluca\" species are unusual among dinoflagellates in appearing to have a diplontic life cycle.\n\n\"N. scintillans\" populations can exhibit high concentrations due to high concentrations of the plankton on which they feed, which are likely due to environmental conditions such as well-mixed, nutrient-rich waters, seasonal circulation, and runoff from agricultural pollution.\n\nThe glow produced by \"N. scintillans\" organisms can be perceived by humans as ghostly colored glow or bloom in the water, which appears when the water is disturbed. This gives \"N. scintillans\" the popular names \"sea ghost\" or \"fire of sea\".\n\nBloom color partly derives from the pigments of organisms inside the vacuoles of \"N. scintillans\". Blooms are often red in coastal areas of the North Sea. Green tides result from \"N. scintillans\" populations having green-pigmented prasinophytes (green algae, subphylum Chlorophyta) living in their vacuoles.\n\n\"N. scintillans\" does not appear to be toxic, but it feeds voraciously on phytoplankton, and while doing so, it accumulates and excretes high levels of ammonia into the surrounding water. This may add to the neurotoxins produced by other dinoflagellates, such as \"Alexandrium\" or \"Gonyaulax\" (syn. \"Lingulodinium\") spp., that kill off other aquatic life in the area.\n\nDNA sequence comparisons suggest that the closest relative of the genus \"Noctiluca\" is \"Spatulodinium\". \"Spatulodinium pseudonoctiluca\" seems to be more closely related to \"N. scintillans\" than to other \"Spatulodinium\" species.\n\"N. scintillans\" is also placed within a classification scheme that has a class Diniferea, or Dinophyceae, which includes nonparasitic dinoflagellates that lack armor plating.\n\n"}

{"id": "2289578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289578", "title": "Camptosaurus", "text": "Camptosaurus\n\nCamptosaurus ( ) is a genus of plant-eating, beaked ornithischian dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic period of western North America. The name means 'flexible lizard' (Greek καμπτος (') meaning 'bent' and σαυρος (') meaning 'lizard').\n\n\"Camptosaurus\" is a relatively heavily built form, with robust hindlimbs and broad feet, still having four toes. Due to the separate status of \"Uteodon\" it has become problematic which material from the Morrison belongs to \"Camptosaurus\". The specimens with certainty belonging to \"Camptosaurus dispar\", from Quarry 13, have been recovered from very deep layers, probably dating to the Callovian-Oxfordian. The largest fragments from later strata indicate adult individuals more than long, and at the hips. The Quarry 13 individuals are smaller though. They have been described as reaching 6 meters (19.7 feet) in length and 785 – 874 kg in weight. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave an even lower estimate: a length of five metres and a weight of half a tonne.\n\nEarlier reconstructions, such as those by Marsh and Gilmore, were based on the skull of \"Theiophytalia\" and display an incorrect, more rectangular profile. The skull was in fact triangular with a pointed snout, equipped with a beak. Its teeth were more tightly packed in the jaw compared to other Morrison euornithopods. Museum curator John Foster describes them as having \"thick median ridges on their lateral sides and denticles along their edges,\" these features were similar to, but \"more fully developed\" than those in \"Dryosaurus\". \"Camptosaurus\" teeth frequently exhibit extensive wear, which indicates that individuals in the genus had a diet of relatively tough vegetation.\n\nOn September 4, 1879 William Harlow Reed in Albany County, Wyoming found the remains of a small euornithopod. That same year Professor Othniel Charles Marsh described and named the find as \"Camptonotus\", or \"flexible back\", from Greek κάμπτω, \"to bend\" and νῶτον, \"back\", in reference to the presumed flexibility of the sacral vertebrae. The holotype was YPM 1877, a partial skeleton. The genus was renamed \"Camptosaurus\" by him in 1885 because the original name was already in use for a cricket. In 1879, Marsh named \"C. dispar\" (type species of the genus) for material he received from his collectors at \"Quarry 13\" near Como Bluff, Wyoming in the Morrison Formation and \"C. amplus\" based on the holotype YPM 1879, a foot found by Arthur Lakes at \"Quarry 1A\". The foot was later shown to have belonged to \"Allosaurus\". Throughout the 1880 and 1890s, he continued to receive specimens from Quarry 13 and in 1894 named two additional species: \"C. medius\" and \"C. nanus\", based in part on size. Charles W. Gilmore named two additional species, \"C. browni\" and \"C. depressus\" in his 1909 redescription of the Marsh specimens. In the Morrison Formation, \"Camptosaurus\" fossils are present in stratigraphic zones 2-6.\n\nThen in 1980, Peter Galton and H.P. Powell in their redescription of \"C. prestwichi\" (see following), considered \"C. nanus\", \"C. medius\" and \"C. browni\" to be different growth stages or different gender of the larger \"C. dispar\", and therefore only \"C. dispar\" was a valid species. They also considered a skull, YPM 1887, in 1886 referred to \"C. amplus\" by Marsh, later confirmed by Gilmore, to belong to \"C. dispar\" as well. Gilmore had used this skull to describe the skull of \"Camptosaurus\", but the specimen was recently shown by Brill and Carpenter not to belong to \"Camptosaurus\". In 2007, they put it into its own genus and species, \"Theiophytalia kerri\".\n\"Camptosaurus depressus\" was recovered from the Lakota Formation near the town of Hot Springs, South Dakota. It was described by Charles Gilmore in 1909 based on the holotype and only known specimen USNM 4753, a fragmentary postcranium, by the \"narrowness or depressed nature of the ilia\". Carpenter and Wilson (2008) referred this species to \"Planicoxa\", as \"P. depressa\", on the basis of similarities between its ilium and the holotype ilium of \"Planicoxa venenica\". However, McDonald and colleagues (2010), and McDonald (2011) found that the horizontal postacetabular process of \"C. depressus\" is more likely a product of distortion. Therefore, McDonald put it into its own genus, \"Osmakasaurus\". An additional species, \"Camptosaurus aphanoecetes\", was named by Carpenter and Wilson in 2008 for specimens from Dinosaur National Monument. It differs from \"C. dispar\" in the lower jaw, shorter neck vertebrae, and straighter ischium ending in a small \"foot\" among other features. An analysis by Andrew McDonald and colleagues in 2010 suggested that like \"C. aphanoecetes\" is actually more closely related to more advanced iguanodonts (Styracosterna). It has been moved to the new genus \"Uteodon\".\nWhile Marsh was describing \"Camptosaurus\" species in North America, numerous species from Europe were also referred to the genus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: \"C. inkeyi\", \"C. hoggii\", \"C. leedsi\", \"C. prestwichi\", and \"C. valdensis\". \"C. inkeyi\" (Nopcsa, 1900) consists of fragmentary material, a dentary and articular from Upper Cretaceous rocks of the Haţeg Basin in Romania. It is almost certainly a rhabdodontid and is no longer considered valid (\"nomen dubium\"). \"C. valdensis\" is a dubious dryosaurid, based on the holotype and only known specimen NHMUK R167, a poorly preserved left femur lacking the distal end. It is thus difficult to compare it to other dryosaurids, including the contemporary \"Valdosaurus canaliculatus\". \"C. leedsi\" is probably a valid dryosaurid that has been moved to the new genus \"Callovosaurus\". \"C. hoggii\" was originally named \"Iguanodon hoggii\" by Richard Owen in 1874 and was moved to \"Camptosaurus\" by Norman and Barrett in 2002. It has since been transferred to the genus \"Owenodon\".\n\nThe remaining European species \"Camptosaurus prestwichii\" was recovered from Chawley Brick Pits, Cumnor Hurst in Oxfordshire in England. The fossil was found when a tramway was driven into the side of a hill. It was described by Hulke in 1880 as \"Iguanodon prestwichii\", and then placed in its own genus \"Cumnoria\" by Seeley in 1888, but was soon sunk into \"Camptosaurus\" by Lydekker in 1889. However, Naish & Martill (2008), McDonald and colleagues (2010), and McDonald (2011) found that Seeley's original generic distinction was valid. \"Cumnoria\" has been recovered as a styracosternan, more closely related to advanced iguanodonts than to \"Camptosaurus dispar\", similar to the case of \"Uteodon\".\n\nMarsh in 1885 assigned \"Camptosaurus\" to a family of its own: the Camptosauridae. Alternatively some authors considered it an early member of the Iguanodontidae.\n\nModern phylogenetics has made \"Camptosaurus\" by definition part of the clade Ankylopollexia, of which group it would then be a basal member. \nThis would mean that the genus is closely related to the ancestor of later iguanodontid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs and was more derived than contemporaries such as \"Dryosaurus\", \"Drinker\", and \"Othnielosaurus\".\n\nIn the 2010 and 2011 cladistic analyses of McDonald and colleagues, \"Camptosaurus\" was placed as follows:\n\nBased on studies of other iguanodonts (clade Iguanodontia), scientists believe they may have been able to achieve running speeds of 25 km per hour (15 mph). A tiny 9 inch fossilized embryo, referred to \"Camptosaurus\", was retrieved from Morrison Formation strata at Dinosaur National Monument in Utah.\n\n"}
{"id": "2289586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289586", "title": "Joshua Scottow", "text": "Joshua Scottow\n\nJoshua Scottow (England, ca. 1618 - Boston, Massachusetts, USA, January 20, 1698), was a colonial American merchant and the author of two histories of early New England: \"Old Men's Tears for Their Own Declensions\" (1691) and \"A Narrative of the Planting of the Massachusetts Colony Anno 1628\" (1694).\n\nScottow emigrated to Massachusetts between 1630 and 1634 with his widowed mother Thomasina and older brother Thomas. He settled in Boston and was admitted to membership in the Old (South) Church in 1639. He married Lydia (surname unknown) in 1640, and they had seven children. He acquired considerable wealth trading with Acadia, dealing in waterfront property, and developing frontier settlements near Scarborough, Maine. In November 1658, William Crowne, proprietor of Nova Scotia, leased a portion of the colony to Scottow and Captain George Curwin (grandfather of Salem Witch Trials high sheriff George Corwin). He served as a captain in King Philip's War alongside pardoned pirate Peter Roderigo. He was survived by his wife and four children, three daughters and a son Thomas, who graduated from Harvard College in 1677.\n\nScottow was a Puritan and self-described \"Old Planter.\" Both of his histories declare that the founding generation of New England was “animated as with one soul” for the achievement of a millennial religious mission and that the present (1690s) generation has lost its focus and loyalties. Scottow’s language is replete with biblical and classical references. \n\nIn 1656, Scottow seems to have opposed some aspect of the prosecution of Ann Hibbins, who was accused of witchcraft. Scottow wasn't alone. Another contemporary critic of the trial, Rev. John Norton (a hero of Scottow's) was said to have quipped that Hibbins \"was hanged for having more wit than her neighbors.\" Ann Hibbins was executed on June 19,1656 and Scottow was one of five men named in her will. The winter following her execution, Scottow was elected as a town selectman for the first time. Around the same time of his election, Scottow seems to have felt pressured to retract his original support for Hibbins and issue an apology to the court. \"He stated that he did not intend to oppose the proceedings of the General Court in the case of Mrs. Ann Hibbins: \" I am cordially sorry that anything from me, either in word or writing, should give offense to the honored Court, my dear brethren in the church, or any others.\" \n\nScottow finally returned to the same subject almost 40 years later in 1694. This was less than two years after the infamous trials at Salem, which he addresses at length in his, \"Narrative of the Planting\" making this work an important contemporary source. Scottow again seems to come down on the side of presumed innocence and against the accusers whose testimony was fickle and inconsistent (\"said, and unsaid\"). He further blames a departure from the non-superstitious theology taught by Jean Calvin (\"Geneva\") and embraced by the earlier teachers:, \"Can it be rationally supposed:? that had we not receded from having Pastors, Teachers, and Ruling Elders, and Churches doing their duty as formerly... that the Roaring Lion [the father of lies] could have gained so much ground upon us...\" Scottow includes a tally, \"...above two hundred accused, one hundred imprisoned, thirty condemned, and twenty executed.\" In the previous decade, Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather, had both been industrious in New England's government and written several enthusiastic books on witchcraft. Scottow was also a close neighbor to one of the judges Samuel Sewall. In bringing the witchcraft trials to an end, Scottow seems to give credit to the relatively un-zealous leadership of the swashbuckling and non-literary governor, the native born William Phips \"\"who being divinely destined, and humanely commissioned, to be the pilot and steersman of this poor be-misted and be-fogged vessel in the Mare Mortuum and mortiforous sea of witchcraft, and fascination; by heaven's conduct according to the integrity of his heart, not trusting the helm in any other hand, he being by God and their Majesties be-trusted therewith, he so happily shaped, and steadily steered her course, as she escaped shipwreck... cutting asunder the Circean knot of Inchantment... hath extricated us out of the winding and crooked labyrinth of Hell's meander.\"\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2289587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289587", "title": "Teso people", "text": "Teso people\n\nThe Iteso (or people of Teso) are a Nilotic ethnic group in eastern Uganda and western Kenya. Teso refers to the traditional homeland of the Iteso, and \"Ateso\" is their language. Iteso is plural (two or more people from Teso), Etesot and Atesot are singular. Etesot is for male person from Teso and Atesot is feminine. Iteso are believed to have migrated from Abyssinia (Ethiopia).\n\nIn Uganda, Iteso inhabit the districts of Soroti, Kumi, Katakwi, Amuria, Bukedea, Serere, Ngora, Pallisa, Kaberamaido, Tororo, Kapelebyong and Kalaki. Iteso are very generous and hospitable people. The cultural drink of Iteso is 'ajon' , commonly consumed in local ceremonies and social gatherings. They practice crop and animal farming and attach great value to land. \n\nTeso traditions relate that they originated somewhere in what is now Egypt in the area of Alexandra. They are believed to have descended from the Hebrew Joseph who had married a black Egyptian. Later when the Israeli slaves left Egypt for the promised land, the group followed the blue Nile river into Ethiopia. They then moved in a south easterly direction and settled in North Eastern Uganda, in what is now Karamoja. The word Karamoja lends itself into Karamojong which means \" the old person is fatigued\". Legend has it that either as a sect, a clan or of a similar tribal identity to the Karamojong, tt is from here that they obtained the name Iteso, a derivative word, meaning \"graves\". The oldmen--the Karamojong--- where concerned, perhaps even anxious that if these group of Karamojong moved on, they would die hence becoming \"graves\", from which the word \"atesia\" originates, and the tribal name, Iteso, took on. Some accounts indicate bible or scriptural influence where by the Iteso saw a land, part of the promise to Jacob, the grand son of Abraham, as a land divided by small rivers originating from the White Nile, theirs was the Upper Nile area. From the Ethiopian mountains is where they saw the land. They later migrated south West over a period of centuries.\n\nThey are part of a larger group of Eastern Nilotic peoples(Ikatung'a,Oltung'a,Itung'a) which include; the Maa(Samburu and Maasai),Turkana of Kenya, Nyangatom of present-day Ethiopia, Karamojong and the Toposa of South Sudan. The Ateker further split into several groups, including Jie, Turkana, Karamojong and Teso.\n\nThe Teso established themselves in present-day north-eastern Uganda and western Kenya near Mt.elgon, and in the mid-18th century some began to move farther south. During the course of this latter migration, conflicts ensued with other ethnic groups in the region, leading to the split of Teso territory into a northern and southern part.\nTeso warriors\n\nIn 1902, part of eastern Uganda was transferred to western Kenya - leading to further separation of Teso.\n\nNorthern Teso occupy the area previously known as Teso District in Uganda (now the districts of Amuria, Soroti, Kumi, Katakwi, Pallisa, Bukedea and Kaberamaido). Southern Teso live mainly in the districts of Tororo, Bugiri and Busia in Uganda, and Busia District in Kenya's Western Province.\n\nIn Uganda, the Iteso live mainly in Teso sub-region, i.e., the districts of Amuria, Bukedea, Butebo, Kaberamaido, Kapelebyong, Katakwi, Kumi, Ngora, Serere and Soroti, but also in Bugiri and Pallisa, as well as in the districts of Tororo and Busia. They number about 3.2 million (9.6% of Uganda's population). Until 1980, they were the second largest ethnic group in Uganda. As of 2002 they were the fifth largest but this has remained questionable especially since there has never been any genocide that could have massacred more than a half of the Iteso populace. Most of the Iteso therefore contend that they are still the second largest ethnic group in Uganda. In fact the figure portrayed by UBOS is rather a political statement than an accurate recording of the Iteso in Uganda. Most Teso elites continue to argue that, since the national budget is disbursed based on population numbers, some individuals in government often manipulate these figures to suit their political interests and as such, as long as the current NRM government continues in power, the national population census figures can never be accurate but rather will continue to serve selfish political interests in order to justify why some areas in the country like Teso, remain poor and underdeveloped.\n\nThe Iteso in Kenya, numbering about 578,000, live mainly in Busia county. The Kenyan Teso people are an extension of their Ugandan counterparts in that they were merely separated by the partition of East Africa during the historic scramble and partition of Africa just like the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania and the Oromo of Kenya and Ethiopia. They are among the Plain Nilotic groups closely related to the Turkana, Karamojong, Toposa, Kumam, Lango and the Maa groups of the Maasai and Samburu.\nThe prominent people in Teso include the current governor of Busia County, Hon Sospeter Ojaamong, Hon Albert Ekirapa, Ojamaa Ojaamong, Oduya Oprong, Pancras Otwani, educationists like Isogol Titus, Silvester Silver Omunyu and student leaders like Titus Adungosi,Odula Ongaria Meshack Patrick Emongaise, Samson Iliwa and Odeke Opama Silas Okatagoro(Information Scientist/ Teso Author).\nThe Iteso people are located in Western Province of Kenya currently in Busia County which is in South of Mt. Elgon. In Busia county, they inhabit two subcounties currently, Teso North and Teso South Subcounties. Still, a large number of them inhabit parts of Bungoma and even Trans Nzoia Counties which are dominated by the Bukusu of the Luhya community.\nTeso people are the only Plains Nilotic people whose lifestyles underwent drastic changes. Having been pastoralists since time immemorial, these people are now the most successful farmers in both Western Kenya and Eastern Uganda.\nIn recent years the people have changed much of their lifestyle. They used to exhume the dead after some time because of population pressure on their land and they no longer have bushes to dump the bones of people who died long time ago. Now they use cement graves—a sign that they have embraced new ways of dealing with the dead. They believe in one God (Akuj/amsabwa) and also in life after death.\n\nList of notable people in Teso:\n"}

Mack (born November 17, 1944) is a Senior Advisor to the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the former CEO & Chairman of the Board at Morgan Stanley, the New York-based investment bank and brokerage firm.\n\nMack was born in Mooresville, North Carolina, the son of Alice (née Azouri) and Charles Mack. Mack's father's original family name was Makhoul; he came to the United States from Lebanon when he was 12 years old, following Mack's grandfather, who had arrived at Ellis Island in 1909.\n\nThe family settled in North Carolina. Mack's father ran a wholesale grocery, clothing, and general merchandise store called John Mack & Son in Mooresville, North Carolina. The business occupied The John Mack Building from 1937 to the 1990s. Mack is the youngest of six sons. The family was Catholic.\n\nIn 1968, Mack graduated from Duke University, where he attended on a football scholarship and majored in history. Mack's first job in finance was as a clerk at a small brokerage house during his junior year at Duke, after a cracked vertebra made it impossible for him to continue on his football scholarship.\n\nMack worked at several firms around Wall Street before starting his career at Morgan Stanley in 1972 as a salesman, and has since worked for the company for nearly thirty years. Rising steadily to positions of increasing responsibility, Mack eventually headed the firm's Worldwide Taxable Fixed Income Division from 1985 to 1992. In 1987, he became a member of the board of directors. In March 1992, he assumed responsibility for Morgan Stanley's day-to-day operations as chairman of the operating committee. He was named President of Morgan Stanley in June 1993. Mack served as president, chief operating officer and a director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. from May 1997 when the firm was created by the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, two of the world's leading financial services companies.\n\nIn 2001, Mack left Morgan Stanley after a power struggle with Phil Purcell; Purcell became CEO of Morgan Stanley after the 1997 merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, of which Purcell was already CEO.\n\nSix months later, in June 2001, Mack was hired as CEO of Credit Suisse, then known as Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB). Mack's time at Credit Suisse was marked much restructuring and by compliances issues created by Frank Quattrone's Technology Group.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Mack returned to Morgan Stanley as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, replacing Purcell. Mack was noted for stabilizing the firm and reenergizing its culture and client franchise, despite an economic downturn.\n\nMack announced his retirement as Chief Executive Officer on September 10, 2009, which was effective January 1, 2010. In 2011, Mack retired from Morgan Stanley after more than 30 years as an investment banker. Former Co-President James P. Gorman succeeded him as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Mack joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as a Senior Advisor.\n\nIn 2013 Mack joined Rosneft, the Russian, state-owned, oil company that has BP as an investor of approximately 20%. In 2014 he announced his departure, shortly after the CEO Igor Sechin had sanctions imposed upon him by the US. Different reasons were given for his departure; Mack said his contract had only been for a year, while Rosneft spokespeople said he had decided to leave for personal reasons.\n\nIn 2006, Mack was accused by former SEC investigator Gary J. Aguirre of insider trading. On October 5, 2006, the SEC recommended no action be taken against Mack. In late November 2006, Mack and Pequot were notified that the investigation had been closed and no action would be taken against them.\n\nWhile CEO of Morgan Stanley in 2006, Mack earned a total compensation of $41,399,010, which included a base salary of $800,000, stocks granted of $36,179,923, and options granted of $4,019,934.\n\nIn 2008, he earned a total compensation of $1,235,097, which included a base salary of $800,000 and other compensation of $435,097. He did not receive any cash, stock, or options.\n\nIn 2014, Mack defended the high fees paid to CEOs, saying on Bloomberg Television that the discussion of compensation was healthy, but that CEOs earn the rates.\n\nMack guided the firm through the financial crisis of 2007–2008, building its capital position and overseeing the firm's conversion to a bank holding company. To stabilize the firm, he forged strategic alliances with China Investment Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Group and entered into a joint venture with Smith Barney, forming at the time the world's largest wealth management firm. During the crisis, Mack was advised by U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and the head of the Federal Reserve Bank Ben Bernanke to sell Morgan Stanley. He has stated that during negotiations he was under considerable pressure from the president of the New York Federal Reserve, Tim Geithner, to sell or merge Morgan Stanley to one of his competitors such as JP Morgan. Mack saw this as being contrary to the interests of Morgan Stanley shareholders and employees, similar to the demise of Bear Stearns in a forced sale to JP Morgan for $2 per share, (the deal was later revised to $10 a share), and insisted on finding other sources of financing instead.\n\n\nMack has donated to various entities through the Christy and John Mack Foundation, formerly known as C.J. Mack Foundation:\n\nMack earned the nickname \"Mack the Knife\" for his cost-cutting prowess while managing the fixed income division at Morgan Stanley, and he lived up to his billing at CSFB, where he cut 10,000 jobs and returned the bank to profitability.\n\nMack was portrayed in the HBO film \"Too Big to Fail\" by Tony Shalhoub and in the BBC film \"The Last Days of Lehman Brothers\" by Henry Goodman. His career is also covered in detail in a 2007 book by Patricia Beard, \"\". The 2010 documentary \"Plunder: The Crime of Our Time\" by Danny Schechter opens with a demonstration outside his home by people who lost their houses in the Great Recession.\n\n\nMack is married to Meredith Mack (née King). Mr Mack now resides in the Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickly Heights, where his wife Meredith was born and raised. They have three children.\n\n"}
{"id": "2289622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289622", "title": "El Bulli", "text": "El Bulli\n\nEl Bulli () was a Michelin 3-star restaurant near the town of Roses, Catalonia, Spain, run by chef Ferran Adrià and driven by the culinary ideas of Albert Adrià. The small restaurant overlooked Cala Montjoi, a bay on Catalonia's Costa Brava, and was described in UK newspaper \"The Guardian\" as \"the most imaginative generator of haute cuisine on the planet\". The restaurant was also associated with molecular gastronomy.\n\nThe restaurant closed on 30 July 2011 and was reopened as a creativity centre in 2014.\n\nThe restaurant had a limited season: the PIXA season, for example, ran from 15 June to 20 December. Bookings for the next year were taken on a single day after the closing of the current season. It accommodated only 8,000 diners a season, but got more than two million requests. The average cost of a meal was €250 (US$325). The restaurant itself had operated at a loss since 2000, with operating profit coming from El Bulli-related books and lectures by Adrià. As of April 2008, the restaurant employed 42 chefs.\n\n\"Restaurant\" magazine judged El Bulli to be No. 1 on its Top 50 list of the world's best restaurants for a record five times—in 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, and No. 2 in 2010.\n\nThe restaurant's location was selected in 1961 by Dr. Hans Schilling, a German, and his Czech wife Marketa, who wanted a restaurant for a piece of land he had purchased. The name \"El Bulli\" came from the French bulldogs the Schillings owned. The first restaurant was opened in 1964.\n\nThe restaurant won its first Michelin star in 1976 while under French chef Jean-Louis Neichel. Ferran Adrià joined the staff in 1984, and was put in sole charge of the kitchen in 1987. In 1990 the restaurant gained its second Michelin star, and in 1997 its third.\n\nEl Bulli has published books on its development, menu and philosophy since 1993, in both large format, some including CD-ROMs, and small format for supermarket sales. Ferran Adrià, Juli Soler, and Albert Adrià published \"A Day at El Bulli\" in 2008. The book describes 24 hours in the life of El Bulli in pictures, commentary and recipes. Among the recipes included in the book are melon with ham, pine-nut marshmallows, steamed brioche with rose-scented mozzarella, rock mussels with seaweed and fresh herbs, and passion fruit trees.\n\nAnthony Bourdain described Albert Adrià's contributions thus: \"His book is a shockingly beautiful catalog of his latest accomplishments here ... Pastry chefs everywhere—when they see this—will gape in fear, and awe, and wonder. I feel for them; like Eric Clapton seeing Jimi Hendrix for the first time, one imagines they will ask themselves 'What do I do now?'.\"\n\nTexturas is a range of products by brothers Ferran and Albert Adrià. The products include the Sferificación, Gelificación, Emulsificación, Espesantes and Surprises lines and are the result of a rigorous process of selection and experimentation. Texturas includes products such as Xanthan and Algin which are packaged and labeled as Xantana Texturas and Algin Texturas respectively.\n\nXanthan gum allows the user to use a very small amount to thicken soups, sauces and creams without changing the flavour. Algin is a key component of the \"Spherification Kit\" and is essential for every spherical preparation: caviar, raviolis, balloons, gnocchi, pellets, and mini-spheres.\n\nIn 2010, Ferran Adrià announced he would close El Bulli in 2012, due to the massive monetary loss it was incurring. He was quoted by \"The New York Times\" as planning to replace it with a culinary academy. He later denied the announcement, saying that \"The New York Times\" had misquoted him, and stated that El Bulli would reopen in 2014 after a two-year hiatus, as \"initially planned\" and would still serve food. Adrià later confirmed, in an October 2010 \"Vanity Fair\" article, that the restaurant would be closing permanently after July 2011.\n\nIn 2011, their website stated: \"On July 30th 2011 El Bulli will have completed its journey as a restaurant. We will transform into a creativity center, opening in 2014. Its main objective is to be a think-tank for creative cuisine and gastronomy and will be managed by a private foundation.\" Anthony Bourdain interpreted the goal of the new El Bulli foundation to be an elite culinary and dining experience development workshop, hosting not only chefs but \"architects, philosophers, [and] designers\", and allowing them to \"not just share [their] successes, but to share [their] mistakes or [their] process with the world as it's happening\" by providing a forum to explore such concepts as \"do we need a dining room?\"\n\n\"El Bulli: Cooking in Progress\" is a documentary about the restaurant highlighting the iterative creative process that occurred behind the scenes. Directed by Gereon Wetzel, the film follows the creative team led by Ferran Adrià through the whole 2008–2009 season. It premiered at the 2010 International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam.\n\nIn July 2013, Somerset House in London hosted an exhibition dedicated to the food of Ferran Adrià and El Bulli. The exhibition looked back over the evolution of the restaurant's laboratory and kitchen. Multimedia displays examined the methods behind the creation of signature dishes and original sketches and hand written notes of the recipe creations were on display with plasticine models of the dishes that were served.\n\n\n"}

Until the mid-20th century, it was sometimes assumed to have been the ancestor of the modern town of Urbino; but that city is on the Metauro River and in the same list Pliny mentions an \"Urbinum Mataurense\", a better fit: most topographers therefore did not make the identification.\n\nIn the early 1930s, G. Bizzózero, an amateur archaeologist of Trevi, found ancient remains on a hilltop in Umbria near Collemancio in the comune of Cannara not far from his hometown, and declared them to be the ruins of Urbinum Hortense. There is indeed a rather sizable town on that hill, where excavations have continued sporadically; but its identification is mere surmise, although it has acquired currency by being taken up on widely disseminated tourist and automotive maps of Umbria.\n\n"}
{"id": "2289634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289634", "title": "Will Haven", "text": "Will Haven\n\nWill Haven is a noise metal band from Sacramento, California. Formed in 1995, the group issued albums through many labels and have toured with acts such as Deftones and Soulfly before going on a hiatus in 2002. They would regroup in 2005 and continue to record and tour since. Throughout their history, they have issued 6 full-length albums (the latest being \"Muerte\" in 2018) as well as 2 EPs and a live DVD. Their musical style has been noted to be a combination of many metal and hardcore subgenres.\n\nIn 1995, Will Haven, named after a fictional, self-created character, formed and released a six-track demo. The band was formed from members of Sock, a band that was formed with Shaun Lopez of Far. Will Haven's debut self-titled seven-track EP was released in 1996 to positive reviews. A year later the quartet was signed to Revelation. Singer Grady Avenell guested on two Far tracks - \"9 Miles\", and a cover of Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas Time?\" with Chino Moreno of Deftones.\n\n1997 saw the release of full-length \"El Diablo\" bringing them an increasing amount of attention and a growing fanbase. In 1999, they released \"WHVN\", arguably their heaviest album to date. The song \"Jaworski\" is named after Red Tape's frontman and friend Jeff Jaworski, who was Jeff Irwin's guitar tech at the time; and \"Slopez\" is named after Shaun Lopez, who was the guitarist for Far. During this time, the band recorded a track called \"The Regulator\" for the Bad Brains' \"Never Give In\" tribute album, and toured with Deftones throughout Europe.\n\nIn 2000, long-time drummer Wayne Morse left the band. He was replaced by Mitch Wheeler. Later that year, Grady guested on Soulfly's track \"Pain\", to be featured on the album \"Primitive\". Chino Moreno also guested on that track.\n\nIn 2001, they released the critically acclaimed \"Carpe Diem\", which saw a world-tour promotion, headlining shows in the US, UK, and Japan, and playing the Vans Warped Tour in Australia. Single \"Carpe Diem\" featured Chino Moreno in the promotional video; similarly, members of Haven are in the promotional video for Deftones' \"Bored\", a single from their album \"Adrenaline\".\n\nSinger Grady Avenell left not long after the tour, to raise a family and attend college. Haven released a DVD called \"Foreign Films\" featuring what, at that point, was to be their last ever show in January 2003 - in a small coffeehouse in their hometown of Sacramento, called The Capitol Garage - and a wealth of footage from the final tour. Members of the band went on to form Ghostride (with members of Tinfed and Oddman), the Abominable Iron Sloth, and Death Valley High, as well as their own label, Distruktor Records.\n\nOn October 12, 2005, Will Haven officially regrouped and began writing new songs with original singer Grady Avenell and had initially planned to release a five-song EP with B-sides; however, during the writing process, the band decided to put out a full-length album. Haven, now a five-piece with guitarist Cayle Hunter from Ghostride and Oddman, went to Los Angeles to record 12 songs for the new album; guitarist Jeff Irwin told Rocksound: \"If this is the last record we ever do, then i want it to be our ultimate one -- the one that's absolutely perfect\".\n\nIn January 2006, Haven returned to the stage with a show in Sacramento's Boardwalk. In February, new song \"Handlebars to Freedom\" was uploaded to their MySpace profile. In March, they traveled to the UK, for a co-headlining tour with Crowbar. Avenell was announced unable to perform at the Will Haven dates in Glasgow and Newport, due to problems with his wife in Paris, so Simon Neil of Biffy Clyro, Craig B of Aereogramme, Mikey Dee of Skindred, Crowbar frontman, Kirk Windstein and XSheepX of The Seventh Cross were asked to do guest vocals for both nights. Grady rejoined the band at the following dates. The band had plans for tours through Europe, Australia and a summer tour with the Deftones, but so far, this hasn't happened yet.\n\nAs of August 2006, Will Haven signed a record deal with indie label Bieler Bros. Records. The demos that have been online won't appear on this record. One of the demos, \"Handlebars To Freedom\", will appear on a compilation disc of new Australian label Static Migration Records. Second guitarist Cayle Hunter was kicked out of the band and is now focusing on his new band, called Armed for the Apocalypse.\n\nOn February 19, 2007, Will Haven played a free show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, promising a 'big announcement' would be made at the show – namely that Avenell had left the band and been replaced by longtime friend of the band (and vocalist for Sacramento punk band Red Tape) Jeff Jaworski. In spring 2007, the band went to Europe with Deftones.\n\nThe band released the album \"The Hierophant\" on June 18, 2007 (UK) and June 19, 2007, in the US. A post made by guitarist Jeff Irwin on an unofficial message board stated that the band intend to tour the new material later on in 2007.\n\nA headline UK tour eventually followed in November 2007 without Mike Martin on bass; however no explanation has been given for his absence. Bass duties for the tour were covered by long-time friend Rey Osburn.\n\nIn September 2008, Will Haven embarked on a headlining European tour with French band My Own Private Alaska and further support differing per city. Again Reyka Osburn played bass, as Mike Martin was raising a family.\n\nOn October 12, 2009, the following was said about Grady rejoining the group: \"After a little time off and doing a few benefit shows for our brother Chi Cheng of the Deftones, we are back to work. As some of you may have seen Grady did join us for a few of the benefit shows we did for Chi and also an amazing show in San Francisco a few months ago. After those shows we had a few discussions about will havens future and Grady expressed that he would like to be a part of it. So after working out details I am very happy to say that we are currently working on a new record with Grady handling the vocal duties. Jeff Jaworski will still be a big part of the band and helping with the writing process on the new record. So we are more than excited to be all working together on making an amazing record.\"\n\nIn April 2010, the band announced that Chris Fehn would be assuming bass duties for their upcoming album and tours, replacing Mike Martin.\n\nAn EP titled \"Open the Mind to Discomfort\" saw release in May 2015 via Artery Recordings.\n\nA full-length LP titled \"Muerte\" was released via Minus Head in March 2018, with guest appearances from Mike Scheidt of Yob and Stephen Carpenter of Deftones.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Haven have shared the stage with the following artists:\n\n"}
{"id": "2289639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289639", "title": "Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Lexington, Kentucky)", "text": "Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Lexington, Kentucky)\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar High School (PLD) is a secondary school located at 1600 Man o' War Boulevard on the southwest side of Lexington, Kentucky, United States. The school is one of six high schools in the Fayette County Public Schools district.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar High School is named after the 19th century African-American poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar, whose parents were from Kentucky.The school was opened in 1990. With an enrollment of over 2100, it is one of the largest public high schools in Kentucky, and was the largest during the 2005–06, 2006–07, and 2007–08 academic years. It also houses the Math, Science, and Technology Center. The PLD student body, unlike that of most of the other schools named after Dunbar, has a substantial white majority, although African Americans and Hispanics make up roughly one sixth of the students.\n\nThe school name was part of a political deal made in 1965 with the city's African-American community. In the era of segregated schools, Dunbar High School, also named after the poet, was the city's lone surviving black high school (grades 10–12 of Douglass School had been shut down in 1963) and one of the main cornerstones of Lexington's black community. When Fayette County's schools integrated in 1967, Dunbar High was closed, with its students being bused to four previously white schools. Eventually, the county school board agreed that the next high school to open in Lexington would bear Dunbar's name, principally at the urging of the Rev. William Augustus Jones, Sr., senior minister of Lexington's oldest and largest black church and a civil rights leader whose five oldest children had graduated from Dunbar and embarked on careers of distinction. To the board's credit, it kept its word, even though a full generation had passed since the original agreement. To keep the schools differentiated, the new school was given the poet's full name, rather than just the last name as with the old school. As an additional tribute to the old Dunbar High School, the gymnasium was named the \"S.T. Roach Sports Center\" for basketball coach Sanford T Roach, who led the school to a 512–142 record from 1942 to 1965, and is a member of the National High School Sports Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame. The new PLD adopted the original school colors of the old Dunbar High (which were red and black, but changed to green and white during the 1940s). The new high school did not, however, retain the former school's \"Bearcats\" mascot. A vote of the school's future students shortly before the school's opening favored \"Bulldogs\" and selected \"The Victors\", by Louis Elbel, as the basis of the fight song.\n\nThe building of the original high school at 545 North Upper Street has since been converted to the Dunbar Community Center, which serves myriad cultural, educational and recreational needs for the city of Lexington. The Dunbar Community Center is operated by the city's department of Parks & Recreation.\n\nSince opening, Dunbar has averaged more than 15 National Merit Semifinalists a year, with 71 in the last four years. Of the Class of 2008, 75% continued on to four-year colleges or universities, with another 17% attending two-year colleges or technical schools. As of 2017, Dunbar offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses in twenty subject areas.. In January 2019, Dunbar senior Rachel Seevers was named one of 40 finalists nationwide in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors. Rachel is only Kentucky's fifth finalist in the last forty years. Her project also went on to win the Intel Young Scientist Foundation Award at the 2019 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), placing her second in the world.\n\nThe Math, Science, and Technology Center, also known as MSTC, is a magnet program housed in Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. The program accepts 55 students each year, selected from the 2500 incoming high school freshmen in Fayette County. Many MSTC courses exceed the comparable AP curriculum. Many MSTC students have received perfect scores on both the SAT and ACT exams. MSTC graduates are each offered an average of 50 scholarships from different schools (valued at over 1 million), and have attended twenty of the top thirty universities and colleges in the country as ranked by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe PLD academic team has won numerous, including Governor's Cup championships in 2000 and 2001. In 2000, Dunbar's United States Academic Decathlon team won the state division for the first time and proceeded to nationals.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar offers many sports, including football, boys' and girls' basketball, soccer, baseball, softball, boys' lacrosse, tennis, golf, track and field, cheerleading, swimming, dancing, wrestling, and ice hockey. Altogether, Dunbar's athletic teams have won 2 state championships (cheerleading, 1; boys' soccer, ; baseball, ; girls' golf, ; girls' track and field, ; girls' cross country, ; boys' basketball, ; boys' tennis, ; swimming, ) in the school's 1 years, and the cheerleaders have won national championships.\n\nPLD had a competitive boys' basketball program almost from the beginning. In 1993 the team, led by Darnell Burton, were State Runners-Up, and in 1994, led by Cameron Mills, the team repeated as State Runners-Up. In 197 the team again reached the Sweet Sixteen, losing in the first round.\n\nThe Bulldogs boys basketball team captured the 201 KHSAA Boys Sweet 16 Championship over Doss 6–5. PLD was led by tournament MVP Tavieo Hollingswort.\n\nThe first football playoff appearance was in 1995. For the first five and a half years, the PLD football team played their \"home\" games at other Lexington high schools. Midway through the 199 season, PLD's football stadium opened, and that year the school advanced to the playoffs for the second time. In 1996 they were the AAA state runners-up, losing the championship game in overtime.\n\nThe football stadium was later named for Jon R. Akers, PLD's first principal and the father of National Football League placekicker David Akers.\n\nThe current head coach of the PLD Swim Team is Cole Pleasants, a former swimmer at Dunbar. The Swim Team has three state championships. They won three straight in 200, 200 and 200. Dunbar has dominated their region winning multiple region titles. In 2016, PLD was runner up in team scores at the KHSAA Swimming and Diving Championships.\n\nIn 1992, 2001, 2005 and 2013 PLD Soccer were the State Champions. All four championships were under Todd Bretz, who was the head coach since the program's inception with one of the highest records of any Kentucky high school soccer coaches (493-169-38), until Fayette County schools sidelined him in September of 2019. Zach Byrd also won a Kentucky Mr. Soccer in 2010 when Dunbar lost in the elite eight against Henry Clay.\n\nPLD Cheerleading is nationally competitive. They have been UCA National Champions in the Large Varsity Division (all girls) in 1995, 2004–2008, 2011 and 2013. They are the only squad to ever be national champions five times in a row. They were UCA National Runners-Up in 1994, 2002, 2003, 2017 and Third Place in 1993 and 2009, Cheersports National Champions in 2003, KAPOS State Champions in 1994, 1997, 2000–2013, and KHSAA State Champions in 2016 and 2017. They have been nationally ranked for twelve years and have been featured in \"American Cheerleader\" magazine. Donna Martin has coached the squad since the school opened in 1990. She has been elected to \"American Cheerleader's\" Who's Who of Cheerleading.\n\nIn 2001, MTV's True Life series prominently featured Dunbar's cheerleading team in the episode \"I'm a Cheerleader.\"\n\nOn November 28, 2005, Lifetime Television announced a reality series featuring the PLD cheerleaders. \"Cheerleader Nation\" premiered in early 2006. The television show had very high ratings.\n\nFormer Dunbar cheerleaders have gone on to cheer for the University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, Morehead State University, Western Kentucky University, Ohio State University, University of Cincinnati, Indiana University, University of Alabama, University of Tennessee, and many other colleges.\n\nIn 2003, PLD Baseball were state champions. That year they also set a Kentucky record for the most wins in one season, winning 41 games and losing only 4. Josh Ellis went a perfect 12–0 in 2003, despite knee injury suffered in a PLD football game, and was named Kentucky's Mr. Baseball. Dunbar was once again state champions in 2007, where they finished with a 38–6 record, and a state record 1.32 ERA.\n\nIn 2005, the girls' track and field team tied as AAA state champions.\n\nBoth the boys' and girls' teams have won the Lexington City Championships each year since 2000. The boys placed second in 2007 to Henry Clay High School in a loss by 3 points. The girls won Region 5 AAA in 2001, 2006, and 2007.\n\nLaura Steinmetz was the girls AAA individual state champion in 2005 and 2006. The girls team were AAA state champions in 2005 and placed third in 2006.\n\nLacrosse is not sanctioned by the KHSAA. Dunbar's team went undefeated and won first place in the 2009 Bluegrass State Games, the first time lacrosse was included in the Games.\nIn the 2011 season, the Dunbar lacrosse team broke a 7-year streak of losses to Lexington Catholic in the second round of the state tournament. They went 12–2 and concluded their season with a 9–7 victory over Ballard in the D-II Championship game. In 2015 the lacrosse team was runner up, losing to Henry Clay in the Championship Game.\n\nLike lacrosse, ice hockey is not sanctioned by KHSAA. Dunbar's team began as a combination of travel and house league players in 2001, and are one of ten teams in the state of Kentucky. However, in 2002 the PLD Ice Hockey team went from being a \"metro\" team to a strictly all Dunbar student team with the help of PE/Health teacher Mr. Jonas. Dunbar ice hockey has played in both the \"A\" (varsity) and \"B\" (junior varsity) levels of Kentucky state hockey.\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar band, currently led by director Brian Morgan, has won national acclaim; they are one of a handful of high school band programs to receive the Sudler Shield twice. The school's commitment to a quality band program was clear from the beginning, when Craig Cornish, coming away from three consecutive state marching band championships, and a 4th place Grand National Championship finalist band at North Hardin High School, was hired as director. In its second year of existence, Dunbar band won the 3A state championship. In 1998, then-assistant director Jeff Hood (who had also earned success and national acclaim as band director at George Rogers Clark and Beechwood) took over. In 2015 Jeff Hood retired and Teresa Elliot was selected as the PLD band's third band director in its 26-year history. After 2 years, Teresa Elliott left Dunbar for Frederick Douglass High School. Brian Morgan was selected for the position of head director in 2017. Mr. Morgan has been with the band since it first opened in 1990; first as percussion instructor and later assistant director. The Dunbar band earned the title of state champion in years 1991 (Class AAA), 2003 and 2004 (Class AAAA), and 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2011 (Class AAAAA); State Runners-Up in 1992, 1994, 1995, and 2002 (Class AAAA) and 2006 and 2008 (Class AAAAA); and a finalist in 1993, 1996–1999, 2001 (AAAA) 2009, 2012–2015 (AAAAA). In 2004, 2005 and 2008 they were Bands of America Regional and Class Champions, at Middle Tennessee State University, Western Kentucky University and University of Louisville, respectively. In 2014 the band was named Class 3A Champions in the prestigious Bands of America Super Regional in St Louis. In 1995, 1996, and 2007 they were Grand Champions at the Contest of Champions at Middle Tennessee State University. Dunbar has participated in the BOA Grand Nationals contest twice (1996 and 2006) placing in the top 20 both times. Altogether, the band have been Grand Champions more than 50 times. The band performed twice in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City: first in 2007 and again in the 2014 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. \n\nThe Dunbar Colorguard is a world class guard that has consistently ranked at both Tristate and National competitions, placing 12th in the 2005 World Colorguard Championships. And in the 2013 WGI championship placed 10th. And have been named Tristate champions several times through the years. WGI Scholastic A Finalist in 2005 and 2013. WGI Scholastic A 16th place in 2010. WGI Scholastic A Semi-Finalist in 2010, 2012, 2014. WGI Nashville Regional Gold Medalist and WGI Mid South Championship Silver Medalist in 2013. Tristate Scholastic A Champions in 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2010. Tristate A Champions in 2003. The PLD guard have captured many best overall Colorguard trophies during marching band season and has become a staple of and a strong presence in the Dunbar band. Many of the guard members play instruments during concert season and in their 2002 show they all dropped their flags and played woodwinds in the 2nd movement.\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar Orchestra regularly places musicians in the All-State Orchestra. The program was built by Robyn Bourgois, who taught two orchestra classes at the school until retiring. After serving for two years as Principal Viola in the Atlanta-Emory Orchestra, Amos Jones, of Dunbar's class of 1996, played professionally for the Charlotte Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar currently operates an exchange program with Hillpark Secondary School in Glasgow, Scotland. Students from each school are chosen annually to live with host families of students from the other school. Additionally many French students participate in the Lexington Sister Cities exchange with Deauville, France and County Kildare, Ireland.\n\nAlso, 3 students have now participated in the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange to Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2289641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289641", "title": "Capilano Suspension Bridge", "text": "Capilano Suspension Bridge\n\nThe Capilano Suspension Bridge is a simple suspension bridge crossing the Capilano River in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The current bridge is long and above the river. It is part of a private facility with an admission fee, and draws over 1.2 million visitors per year.\n\nThe bridge was originally built in 1889 by George Grant Mackay, a Scottish civil engineer and park commissioner for Vancouver. It was originally made of hemp ropes with a deck of cedar planks, and was replaced with a wire cable bridge in 1903. In 1910 Edward Mahon purchased the Capilano Suspension Bridge. \"Mac\" MacEachran purchased the Bridge from Mahon in 1935 and invited local natives to place their totem poles in the park, adding a native theme. In 1945, he sold the bridge to Henri Aubeneau.\n\nThe bridge was completely rebuilt in 1956.\n\nThe park was sold to Nancy Stibbard, the current owner, in 1983. Annual attendance increased, and in May 2004, Treetops Adventures was opened, consisting of seven footbridges suspended between old-growth Douglas Fir trees on the west side of the canyon, forming a walkway up to above the forest floor.\n\nIn June 2011, a new attraction called Cliffwalk was added to the park.\n\nIn September 1999, a woman dropped her 18-month-old child with Down syndrome off the bridge. She claimed she stumbled accidentally and the child slipped from her grasp. The child was not seriously injured. The woman lost legal custody of her child to the child's father as a result of the incident. The woman took legal action against the owner of the bridge, her ex-husband and the Federal Department of Justice. The case against the owner of the bridge was settled in 2004.\n\nIn 2006, a 300-year-old, 46-tonne Douglas fir tree toppled during a heavy snowstorm. The tree fell across the western end of the bridge. Park officials closed the bridge temporarily while repairs were performed.\n\nOn June 6, 2010, a teenage tourist on a class trip from California climbed over a railing and fell more than from a fenced off viewing platform near the bridge. By the time rescue workers came to his aid, the victim was dead. The official RCMP finding was that the teen was under the influence of LSD at the time of the incident.\n\nOn June 2, 2012, a 30-year-old tourist from Ontario died after falling near the bridge. Police say the victim was hiking through trails near the popular attraction when he climbed over a railing and fell to the riverbed below.\n\nThe bridge has been featured as a setting in episodes of several television series, including \"MacGyver\", \"Sliders\", \"\", and \"Psych\".\n\nIn 1974, social psychologists Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron conducted a well-known experiment on the bridge. Men approached by a female researcher on the bridge were more likely to call her later than men approached on a more solid bridge across the river. Dutton and Aron argued that this supported the theory that the men were mis-attributing the arousal caused by fear to sexual attraction toward the woman. This research supported Stanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion.\n\nIn June 2019, Korean Pop group NCT 127 created a video of their visit to the Capilano Suspension Bridge as part of the social media documenting their world tour \"NCT 127: The Origin\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2289648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289648", "title": "Windows Vista", "text": "Windows Vista\n\nWindows Vista is an operating system that was produced by Microsoft and is a version of the Windows NT family of operating systems for use on personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, tablet PCs and media center PCs. Development was completed on November 8, 2006, and over the following three months, it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers, business customers and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released worldwide and was made available for purchase and download from the Windows Marketplace; it is the first release of Windows to be made available through a digital distribution platform. The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor, Windows XP, the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems.\n\nNew features of Windows Vista include an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Aero, a new search component called Windows Search, redesigned networking, audio, print and display sub-systems, and new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker. Vista aimed to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network, using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices. Windows Vista included version 3.0 of the .NET Framework, allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs.\n\nMicrosoft's primary stated objective with Windows Vista was to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system. One common criticism of Windows XP and its predecessors was their commonly exploited security vulnerabilities and overall susceptibility to malware, viruses and buffer overflows. In light of this, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced in early 2002 a company-wide \"Trustworthy Computing initiative\", which aimed to incorporate security into every aspect of software development at the company. Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above finishing Windows Vista, thus delaying its completion.\n\nWhile these new features and security improvements garnered positive reviews, Vista was also the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista targeted its high system requirements, its more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of then-new DRM technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software, longer boot time, and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues, Windows Vista saw initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP. However, Vista usage had surpassed Microsoft's pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users, with an estimated 330 million Internet users in January 2009.\n\nAt the release of its successor, Windows 7 (October 2009), Windows Vista (with approximately 400 million Internet users) was the second most widely used operating system on the Internet with an approximately 19% market share, the most widely used being Windows XP with an approximately 63% market share. In May 2010, Windows Vista's market share had an estimated range from 15% to 26%. On October 22, 2010, Microsoft ceased sales of retail copies of Windows Vista, and the OEM sales for Vista ceased a year later.\n\nMainstream support for Vista ended on April 10, 2012, and extended support ended on April 11, 2017. After that date, Windows Vista users had to upgrade to Windows 7 in order to continue receiving Microsoft support. , Vista's market share has declined to 0.3% of Windows' total market share.\n\nMicrosoft began work on Windows Vista, known at the time by its codename \"Longhorn\", in May 2001, five months before the release of Windows XP. It was originally expected to ship sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between Windows XP and \"Blackcomb\", which was planned to be the company's next major operating system release (which would eventually be released as Windows 7). Gradually, \"Longhorn\" assimilated many of the important new features and technologies slated for Blackcomb, resulting in the release date being pushed back several times in 3 years. In some builds of Longhorn, their license agreement said \"For the Microsoft product codenamed 'Whistler'\". Many of Microsoft's developers were also re-tasked to build updates to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to strengthen security. Faced with ongoing delays and concerns about feature creep, Microsoft announced on August 27, 2004, that it had revised its plans. For this reason, Longhorn was reset to start work on componentizing the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 codebase, and over time re-incorporating the features that would be intended for an actual operating system release. However, some previously announced features such as WinFS were dropped or postponed, and a new software development methodology called the Security Development Lifecycle was incorporated in an effort to address concerns with the security of the Windows codebase, which is programmed in C, C++ and assembly. Longhorn became known as Vista in 2005.\n\nThe early development stages of Longhorn were generally characterized by incremental improvements and updates to Windows XP. During this period, Microsoft was fairly quiet about what was being worked on, as their marketing and public relations focus was more strongly focused on Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, which was released in April 2003. Occasional builds of Longhorn were leaked onto popular file sharing networks such as IRC, BitTorrent, eDonkey and various newsgroups, and so most of what is known about builds prior to the first sanctioned development release of Longhorn in May 2003, is derived from these builds.\n\nAfter several months of relatively little news or activity from Microsoft with Longhorn, Microsoft released Build 4008, which had made an appearance on the Internet around February 28, 2003. It was also privately handed out to a select group of software developers. As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained a number of small improvements, including a modified blue \"Plex\" theme and a new, simplified Windows Image-based installer that operates in graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the same hardware. An optional \"new taskbar\" was introduced that was thinner than the previous build and displayed the time differently.\n\nThe most notable visual and functional difference, however, came with Windows Explorer. The incorporation of the Plex theme made blue the dominant color of the entire application. The Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely replaced with a large horizontal pane that appeared under the toolbars. A new search interface allowed for filtering of results, searching of Windows help, and natural-language queries that would be used to integrate with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed. The \"view modes\" were also replaced with a single slider that would resize the icons in real-time, in list, thumbnail, or details mode, depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also made more visible and more easily editable, with more active encouragement to fill out missing pieces of information. Also of note was the conversion of Windows Explorer to being a .NET application.\n\nMost builds of Longhorn and Vista were identified by a label that was always displayed in the bottom-right corner of the desktop. A typical build label would look like \"Longhorn Build 3663.Lab06_N.020728-1728\". Higher build numbers did not automatically mean that the latest features from every development team at Microsoft was included. Typically, a team working on a certain feature or subsystem would generate their own working builds which developers would test with, and when the code was deemed stable, all the changes would be incorporated back into the main development tree at once. At Microsoft, a number of \"Build labs\" exist where the compilation of the entirety of Windows can be performed by a team. The name of the lab in which any given build originated is shown as part of the build label, and the date and time of the build follows that. Some builds (such as Beta 1 and Beta 2) only display the build label in the version information dialog (Winver). The icons used in these builds are from Windows XP.\n\nAt the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) in May 2003, Microsoft gave their first public demonstrations of the new Desktop Window Manager and Aero. The demonstrations were done on a revised build 4015 which was never released. A number of sessions for developers and hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new features, as well as the Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (previously known as \"Palladium\"), which at the time was Microsoft's proposed solution for creating a secure computing environment whereby any given component of the system could be deemed \"trusted\". Also at this conference, Microsoft reiterated their roadmap for delivering Longhorn, pointing to an \"early 2005\" release date.\n\nBy 2004, it had become obvious to the Windows team at Microsoft that they were losing sight of what needed to be done to complete the next version of Windows and ship it to customers. Internally, some Microsoft employees were describing the Longhorn project as \"another Cairo\" or \"Cairo.NET\", referring to the Cairo development project that the company embarked on through the first half of the 1990s, which never resulted in a shipping operating system (though nearly all the technologies developed in that time did end up in Windows 95 and Windows NT). Microsoft was shocked in 2005 by Apple's release of Mac OS X Tiger. It offered only a limited subset of features planned for Longhorn, in particular fast file searching and integrated graphics and sound processing, but appeared to have impressive reliability and performance compared to contemporary Longhorn builds. Most Longhorn builds had major Explorer.exe system leaks which prevented the OS from performing well, and added more confusion to the development teams in later builds with more and more code being developed which failed to reach stability.\n\nIn a September 23, 2005 front-page article in \"The Wall Street Journal\", Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin, who had overall responsibility for the development and delivery of Windows, explained how development of Longhorn had been \"crashing into the ground\" due in large part to the haphazard methods by which features were introduced and integrated into the core of the operating system, without a clear focus on an end-product. Allchin went on to explain how in December 2003, he enlisted the help of two other senior executives, Brian Valentine and Amitabh Srivastava, the former being experienced with shipping software at Microsoft, most notably Windows Server 2003, and the latter having spent his career at Microsoft researching and developing methods of producing high-quality testing systems. Srivastava employed a team of core architects to visually map out the entirety of the Windows operating system, and to proactively work towards a development process that would enforce high levels of code quality, reduce interdependencies between components, and in general, \"not make things worse with Vista\". Since Microsoft decided that Longhorn needed to be further componentized, work started on the Omega-13 series builds where they would componentize existing Windows Server 2003 source code, and over time add back functionality as development progressed. Future Longhorn builds would start from Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and continue from there.\n\nThis change, announced internally to Microsoft employees on August 26, 2004, began in earnest in September, though it would take several more months before the new development process and build methodology would be used by all of the development teams. A number of complaints came from individual developers, and Bill Gates himself, that the new development process was going to be prohibitively difficult to work within.\n\nBy approximately November 2004, the company had considered several names for the final release, ranging from simple to fanciful and inventive. In the end, Microsoft chose Windows Vista as confirmed on July 22, 2005, believing it to be a \"wonderful intersection of what the product really does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates with customers, and their needs\". Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott \"You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on what's important to you. That's what Windows Vista is all about: \"bringing clarity to your world\" (a reference to the three marketing points of Vista—Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on what matters to you\". Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also loved the name, saying that \"Vista creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with Windows—making people's passions come alive.\"\n\nAfter Longhorn was named Windows Vista in November 2004, an unprecedented beta-test program was started, involving hundreds of thousands of volunteers and companies. In September of that year, Microsoft started releasing regular Community Technology Previews (CTP) to beta testers from July 2005 to February 2006. The first of these was distributed at the 2005 Microsoft Professional Developers Conference, and was subsequently released to beta testers and Microsoft Developer Network subscribers. The builds that followed incorporated most of the planned features for the final product, as well as a number of changes to the user interface, based largely on feedback from beta testers. Windows Vista was deemed feature-complete with the release of the \"February CTP,\" released on February 22, 2006, and much of the remainder of the work between that build and the final release of the product focused on stability, performance, application and driver compatibility, and documentation. Beta 2, released in late May, was the first build to be made available to the general public through Microsoft's Customer Preview Program. It was downloaded by over five million people. Two release candidates followed in September and October, both of which were made available to a large number of users.\n\nAt the Intel Developer Forum on March 9, 2006, Microsoft announced a change in their plans to support EFI in Windows Vista. The UEFI 2.0 specification (which replaced EFI 1.10) was not completed until early 2006, and at the time of Microsoft's announcement, no firmware manufacturers had completed a production implementation which could be used for testing. As a result, the decision was made to postpone the introduction of UEFI support to Windows; support for UEFI on 64-bit platforms was postponed until Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 and 32-bit UEFI would not be supported, as Microsoft did not expect many such systems to be built because the market was quickly moving to 64-bit processors.\n\nWhile Microsoft had originally hoped to have the consumer versions of the operating system available worldwide in time for the 2006 holiday shopping season, it announced in March 2006 that the release date would be pushed back to January 2007 in order to give the company—and the hardware and software companies that Microsoft depends on for providing device drivers—additional time to prepare. Because a release to manufacturing (RTM) build is the final version of code shipped to retailers and other distributors, the purpose of a pre-RTM build is to eliminate any last \"show-stopper\" bugs that may prevent the code from responsibly being shipped to customers, as well as anything else that consumers may find annoying. Thus, it is unlikely that any major new features would be introduced; instead, work would focus on Vista's fit and finish. In just a few days, developers had managed to drop Vista's bug count from over 2470 on September 22 to just over 1400 by the time RC2 shipped in early October. However, they still had a way to go before Vista was ready to RTM. Microsoft's internal processes required Vista's bug count to drop to 500 or fewer before the product could go into escrow for RTM. For most of the pre-RTM builds, those 32-bit editions are only released.\n\nOn June 14, 2006, Windows developer Philip Su posted a blog entry which decried the development process of Windows Vista, stating that \"The code is way too complicated, and that the pace of coding has been tremendously slowed down by overbearing process.\" The same post also described Windows Vista as having approximately 50 million lines of code, with about 2,000 developers working on the product. During a demonstration of the speech recognition feature new to Windows Vista at Microsoft's Financial Analyst Meeting on July 27, 2006, the software recognized the phrase \"Dear mom\" as \"\"Dear aunt\"\". After several failed attempts to correct the error, the sentence eventually became \"\"Dear aunt, let's set so double the killer delete select all\"\". A developer with Vista's speech recognition team later explained that there was a bug with the build of Vista that was causing the microphone gain level to be set very high, resulting in the audio being received by the speech recognition software being \"incredibly distorted\".\n\nWindows Vista build 5824 (October 17, 2006) was supposed to be the RTM release, but a bug, which destroyed any system that was upgraded from Windows XP, prevented this, damaging development and lowering the chance that it would hit its January 2007 deadline.\n\nDevelopment of Windows Vista came to an end when Microsoft announced that it had been finalized on November 8, 2006, and was concluded by co-president of Windows development, Jim Allchin. The RTM's build number had also jumped to 6000 to reflect Vista's internal version number, NT 6.0. Jumping RTM build numbers is common practice among consumer-oriented Windows versions, like Windows 98 (build 1998), Windows 98 SE (build 2222), Windows Me (build 3000) or Windows XP (build 2600), as compared to the business-oriented versions like Windows 2000 (build 2195) or Server 2003 (build 3790). On November 16, 2006, Microsoft made the final build available to MSDN and Technet Plus subscribers. A business-oriented Enterprise edition was made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006. Windows Vista was launched for general customer availability on January 30, 2007.\n\nWindows Vista introduced several features and functionality not present in its predecessors.\n\n\n\nVista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive, which employ fast flash memory (located on USB flash drives and hybrid hard disk drives) to improve system performance by caching commonly used programs and data. This manifests itself in improved battery life on notebook computers as well, since a hybrid drive can be spun down when not in use. Another new technology called SuperFetch utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze usage patterns to allow Windows Vista to make intelligent decisions about what content should be present in system memory at any given time. It uses almost all the extra RAM as disk cache. In conjunction with SuperFetch, an automatic built-in Windows Disk Defragmenter makes sure that those applications are strategically positioned on the hard disk where they can be loaded into memory very quickly with the least amount of physical movement of the hard disk's read-write heads.\n\nAs part of the redesign of the networking architecture, IPv6 has been fully incorporated into the operating system and a number of performance improvements have been introduced, such as TCP window scaling. Earlier versions of Windows typically needed third-party wireless networking software to work properly, but this is not the case with Vista, which includes more comprehensive wireless networking support.\n\nFor graphics, Vista introduces a new Windows Display Driver Model and a major revision to Direct3D. The new driver model facilitates the new Desktop Window Manager, which provides the tearing-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of Windows Aero. Direct3D 10, developed in conjunction with major graphics card manufacturers, is a new architecture with more advanced shader support, and allows the graphics processing unit to render more complex scenes without assistance from the CPU. It features improved load balancing between CPU and GPU and also optimizes data transfer between them. WDDM also provides video content playback that rivals typical consumer electronics devices. It does this by making it easy to connect to external monitors, providing for protected HD video playback and increasing overall video playback quality. For the first time in Windows, graphics processing unit (GPU) multitasking is possible, enabling users to run more than one GPU-intensive application simultaneously.\n\nAt the core of the operating system, many improvements have been made to the memory manager, process scheduler and I/O scheduler. The Heap Manager implements additional features such as integrity checking in order to improve robustness and defend against buffer overflow security exploits, although this comes at the price of breaking backward compatibility with some legacy applications. A Kernel Transaction Manager has been implemented that enables applications to work with the file system and Registry using atomic transaction operations.\n\nImproved security was a primary design goal for Vista. Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing initiative, which aims to improve public trust in its products, has had a direct effect on its development. This effort has resulted in a number of new security and safety features and an Evaluation Assurance Level rating of 4+.\n\nUser Account Control, or UAC is perhaps the most significant and visible of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default, with a view to stopping malware from making unauthorized changes to the system. This was often difficult in previous versions of Windows, as the previous \"limited\" user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a large proportion of application software, and even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray. In Windows Vista, when an action is performed that requires administrative rights (such as installing/uninstalling software or making system-wide configuration changes), the user is first prompted for an administrator name and password; in cases where the user is already an administrator, the user is still prompted to confirm the pending privileged action. Regular use of the computer such as running programs, printing, or surfing the Internet does not trigger UAC prompts. User Account Control asks for credentials in a Secure Desktop mode, in which the entire screen is dimmed, and only the authorization window is active and highlighted. The intent is to stop a malicious program misleading the user by interfering with the authorization window, and to hint to the user the importance of the prompt.\n\nTesting by Symantec Corporation has proven the effectiveness of UAC. Symantec used over 2,000 active malware samples, consisting of backdoors, keyloggers, rootkits, mass mailers, trojan horses, spyware, adware, and various other samples. Each was executed on a default Windows Vista installation within a standard user account. UAC effectively blocked over 50 percent of each threat, excluding rootkits. 5 percent or less of the malware that evaded UAC survived a reboot.\n\nInternet Explorer 7's new security and safety features include a phishing filter, IDN with anti-spoofing capabilities, and integration with system-wide parental controls. For added security, ActiveX controls are disabled by default. Also, Internet Explorer operates in a protected mode, which operates with lower permissions than the user and runs in isolation from other applications in the operating system, preventing it from accessing or modifying anything besides the Temporary Internet Files directory. Microsoft's anti-spyware product, \"Windows Defender\", has been incorporated into Windows, providing protection against malware and other threats. Changes to various system configuration settings (such as new auto-starting applications) are blocked unless the user gives consent.\n\nWhereas prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using Encrypting File System, the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption, which can protect entire volumes, notably the operating system volume. However, BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently not encrypted and to contain system files in order for Windows to boot. In normal circumstances, the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting, or when there is a Windows update that changes files in this area, which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue, because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe), or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write to this \"Ghost Partition\" and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system, or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor (version 1.2) embedded in a computer's motherboard, or with a USB key. However, as with other full disk encryption technologies, BitLocker is vulnerable to a cold boot attack, especially where TPM is used as a key protector without a boot PIN being required too.\n\nA variety of other privilege-restriction techniques are also built into Vista. An example is the concept of \"integrity levels\" in user processes, whereby a process with a lower integrity level cannot interact with processes of a higher integrity level and cannot perform DLL–injection to a processes of a higher integrity level. The security restrictions of Windows services are more fine-grained, so that services (especially those listening on the network) have no ability to interact with parts of the operating system they do not need to. Obfuscation techniques such as address space layout randomization are used to increase the amount of effort required of malware before successful infiltration of a system. Code integrity verifies that system binaries have not been tampered with by malicious code.\n\nAs part of the redesign of the network stack, Windows Firewall has been upgraded, with new support for filtering both incoming and outgoing traffic. Advanced packet filter rules can be created that can grant or deny communications to specific services.\n\nThe 64-bit versions of Vista require that all device drivers be digitally signed, so that the creator of the driver can be identified.\n\nWhile much of the focus of Vista's new capabilities highlighted the new user-interface, security technologies, and improvements to the core operating system, Microsoft also adding new deployment and maintenance features:\n\n\nWindows Vista includes a large number of new application programming interfaces. Chief among them is the inclusion of version 3.0 of the .NET Framework, which consists of a class library and Common Language Runtime and OS/2 environment just like its NT predecessors. Version 3.0 includes four new major components:\n\nThese technologies are also available for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to facilitate their introduction to and usage by developers and end users.\n\nThere are also significant new development APIs in the core of the operating system, notably the completely re-designed audio, networking, print, and video interfaces, major changes to the security infrastructure, improvements to the deployment and installation of applications (\"ClickOnce\" and Windows Installer 4.0), new device driver development model (\"Windows Driver Foundation\"), Transactional NTFS, mobile computing API advancements (power management, Tablet PC Ink support, SideShow) and major updates to (or complete replacements of) many core subsystems such as Winlogon and CAPI.\n\nThere are some issues for software developers using some of the graphics APIs in Vista. Games or programs built solely on the Windows Vista-exclusive version of DirectX, version 10, cannot work on prior versions of Windows, as DirectX 10 is not available for previous Windows versions. Also, games that require the features of D3D9Ex, the updated implementation of DirectX 9 in Windows Vista are also incompatible with previous Windows versions. According to a Microsoft blog, there are three choices for OpenGL implementation on Vista. An application can use the default implementation, which translates OpenGL calls into the Direct3D API and is frozen at OpenGL version 1.4, or an application can use an Installable Client Driver (ICD), which comes in two flavors: legacy and Vista-compatible. A legacy ICD disables the Desktop Window Manager, a Vista-compatible ICD takes advantage of a new API, and is fully compatible with the Desktop Window Manager. At least two primary vendors, ATI and NVIDIA provided full Vista-compatible ICDs. However, hardware overlay is not supported, because it is considered as an obsolete feature in Vista. ATI and NVIDIA strongly recommend using compositing desktop/Framebuffer Objects for same functionality.\n\nWindows Vista is the first Microsoft operating system:\n\n\nSome notable Windows XP features and components have been replaced or removed in Windows Vista, including several shell and Windows Explorer features, multimedia features, networking related functionality, Windows Messenger, NTBackup, the network Windows Messenger service, HyperTerminal, MSN Explorer, Active Desktop, and the replacement of NetMeeting with Windows Meeting Space. Windows Vista also does not include the Windows XP \"Luna\" visual theme, or most of the classic color schemes that have been part of Windows since the Windows 3.x era. The \"Hardware profiles\" startup feature has also been removed, along with support for older motherboard technologies like the EISA bus, APM and game port support (though on the 32-bit version game port support can be enabled by applying an older driver). IP over FireWire (TCP/IP over IEEE 1394) has been removed as well. The IPX/SPX protocol has also been removed, although it can be enabled by a third-party plug-in.\n\nWindows Vista shipped in six different editions. These are roughly divided into two target markets, consumer and business, with editions varying to cater for specific sub-markets. For consumers, there are three editions, with two available for economically more developed countries. Windows Vista Starter edition is aimed for low powered computers with availability only in emerging markets. Windows Vista Home Basic is intended for budget users. Windows Vista Home Premium covers the majority of the consumer market, and contains applications for creating and using multimedia. The home editions cannot join a Windows Server domain. For businesses, there are three editions as well. Windows Vista Business is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises, while Windows Vista Enterprise is only available to customers participating in Microsoft's Software Assurance program. Windows Vista Ultimate contains the complete feature-set of both the Home and Business (combination of both Home Premium and Enterprise) editions, as well as a set of Windows Ultimate Extras, and is aimed at enthusiasts.\n\nAll editions except Windows Vista Starter support both 32-bit (x32) and 64-bit (x64) processor architectures.\n\nIn the European Union, Home Basic N and Business N versions are also available. These come without Windows Media Player, due to EU sanctions brought against Microsoft for violating anti-trust laws. Similar sanctions exist in South Korea.\n\nWindows Vista has four distinct visual styles.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers capable of running Windows Vista are classified as \"Vista Capable\" and \"Vista Premium Ready\". A \"Vista Capable\" or equivalent PC is capable of running all editions of Windows Vista although some of the special features and high-end graphics options may require additional or more advanced hardware. A \"Vista Premium Ready\" PC can take advantage of Vista's high-end features.\n\nWindows Vista's Basic and Classic interfaces work with virtually any graphics hardware that supports Windows XP or 2000; accordingly, most discussion around Vista's graphics requirements centers on those for the Windows Aero interface. As of Windows Vista Beta 2, the NVIDIA GeForce 6 series and later, the ATI Radeon 9500 and later, Intel's GMA 950 and later integrated graphics, and a handful of VIA chipsets and S3 Graphics discrete chips are supported. Although originally supported, the GeForce FX 5 series has been dropped from newer drivers from NVIDIA. The last driver from NVIDIA to support the GeForce FX series on Vista was 96.85. Microsoft offered a tool called the \"Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor\" to assist Windows XP and Vista users in determining what versions of Windows their machine is capable of running. The required server connections for this utility are no longer available. Although the installation media included in retail packages is a 32-bit DVD, customers needing a CD-ROM or customers who wish for a 64-bit install media are able to acquire this media through the Windows Vista Alternate Media program. The Ultimate edition includes both 32-bit and 64-bit media. The digitally downloaded version of Ultimate includes only one version, either 32-bit or 64-bit, from Windows Marketplace.\n\nThe maximum amount of RAM that Windows Vista can support varies, depending on both its edition and its processor architecture, as shown in the table.\n\nThe maximum number of logical processors in a PC that Windows Vista supports is: 32 for 32-bit; 64 for 64-bit.\n\nThe maximum number of physical processors in a PC that Windows Vista supports is: 2 for Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate, and 1 for Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium.\n\nMicrosoft occasionally releases updates such as service packs for its Windows operating systems to fix bugs, improve performance and add new features.\n\nWindows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) was released on February 4, 2008, alongside Windows Server 2008 to OEM partners, after a five-month beta test period. The initial deployment of the service pack caused a number of machines to continually reboot, rendering the machines unusable. This temporarily caused Microsoft to suspend automatic deployment of the service pack until the problem was resolved. The synchronized release date of the two operating systems reflected the merging of the workstation and server kernels back into a single code base for the first time since Windows 2000. MSDN subscribers were able to download SP1 on February 15, 2008. SP1 became available to current Windows Vista users on Windows Update and the Download Center on March 18, 2008. Initially, the service pack only supported five languages – English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese. Support for the remaining 31 languages was released on April 14, 2008.\n\nA white paper, published by Microsoft on August 29, 2007, outlined the scope and intent of the service pack, identifying three major areas of improvement: reliability and performance, administration experience, and support for newer hardware and standards.\n\nOne area of particular note is performance. Areas of improvement include file copy operations, hibernation, logging off on domain-joined machines, JavaScript parsing in Internet Explorer, network file share browsing, Windows Explorer ZIP file handling, and Windows Disk Defragmenter. The ability to choose individual drives to defragment is being reintroduced as well.\n\nService Pack 1 introduced support for some new hardware and software standards, notably the exFAT file system, 802.11n wireless networking, IPv6 over VPN connections, and the Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol.\n\nBooting a system using Extensible Firmware Interface on x64 systems was also introduced; this feature had originally been slated for the initial release of Vista but was delayed due to a lack of compatible hardware at the time. Booting from a GUID Partition Table–based hard drive greater than 2.19 TB is supported (x64 only).\n\nTwo areas have seen changes in SP1 that have come as the result of concerns from software vendors. One of these is desktop search; users will be able to change the default desktop search program to one provided by a third party instead of the Microsoft desktop search program that comes with Windows Vista, and desktop search programs will be able to seamlessly tie in their services into the operating system. These changes come in part due to complaints from Google, whose Google Desktop Search application was hindered by the presence of Vista's built-in desktop search. In June 2007, Google claimed that the changes being introduced for SP1 \"are a step in the right direction, but they should be improved further to give consumers greater access to alternate desktop search providers\". The other area of note is a set of new security APIs being introduced for the benefit of antivirus software that currently relies on the unsupported practice of patching the kernel (\"see Kernel Patch Protection\").\n\nAn update to DirectX 10, named DirectX 10.1, marked mandatory several features that were previously optional in Direct3D 10 hardware. Graphics cards will be required to support DirectX 10.1. SP1 includes a kernel (6001.18000) that matches the version shipped with Windows Server 2008.\n\nThe Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) was replaced by the Group Policy Object Editor. An updated downloadable version of the Group Policy Management Console was released soon after the service pack.\n\nSP1 enables support for hotpatching, a reboot-reduction servicing technology designed to maximize uptime. It works by allowing Windows components to be updated (or \"patched\") while they are still in use by a running process. Hotpatch-enabled update packages are installed via the same methods as traditional update packages, and will not trigger a system reboot.\n\nService Pack 2 for Windows Vista was released to manufacturing on April 28, 2009, and released to Microsoft Download Center and Windows Update on May 26, 2009. In addition to a number of security and other fixes, a number of new features have been added. However, it did not include Internet Explorer 8. Windows Vista Service Pack 2 build number is 6002.18005.090410-1830.\n\nWindows Vista and Windows Server 2008 share a single service pack binary, reflecting the fact that their code bases were joined with the release of Server 2008. Service Pack 2 is not a cumulative update meaning that Service Pack 1 must be installed first.\n\nThe Platform Update for Windows Vista was released on October 27, 2009. It includes major new components that shipped with Windows 7, as well as updated runtime libraries. It requires Service Pack 2 of Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 and is listed on Windows Update as a \"Recommended\" download.\n\nThe Platform Update allows application developers to target both Windows Vista and Windows 7. It consists of the following components:\n\nSome updates are available as separate releases for both Windows XP and Windows Vista:\n\nAlthough extensive, the Platform Update does not bring Windows Vista to the level of features and performance offered by Windows 7. For example, even though Direct3D 11 runtime will be able to run on D3D9-class hardware and WDDM drivers using \"feature levels\" first introduced in Direct3D 10.1, Desktop Window Manager has not been updated to use Direct3D 10.1.\n\nIn July 2011, Microsoft released the Platform Update Supplement for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, which contains several bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\nThe BlueKeep security vulnerability, , that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's Remote Desktop Protocol, has had a fix for it released by Microsoft for Vista.\n\nRelated flaws, were later discovered by Microsoft and dubbed \"DejaBlue\" by other researchers. Patches available to correct the flaw do \"not\" include one for Vista. \n\nIn addition, , based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe), affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows 10 versions, but patches available to correct the flaw do \"not\" include one for Vista.\n\nIn July 2008, Microsoft introduced a web-based advertising campaign called the \"Mojave Experiment\", that depicts a group of people who are asked to evaluate the newest operating system from Microsoft, calling it Windows 'Mojave'. Participants are first asked about Vista, if they have used it, and their overall satisfaction with Vista on a scale of 1 to 10. They are then shown a demo of some of the new operating system's features, and asked their opinion and satisfaction with it on the same 1 to 10 scale. After respondents rate \"Mojave\", they are then told that they were really shown a demo of Windows Vista. The object was to test \"A theory: If people could see Windows Vista firsthand, they would like it.\" According to Microsoft, the initial sample of respondents rated Vista an average of 4.4 out of 10, and Mojave received an average of 8.5, with no respondents rating Mojave lower than they originally rated Windows Vista before the demo. The \"experiment\" has been criticized for deliberate selection of positive statements and not addressing all aspects of Vista.\n\nWindows Vista received mixed reviews at the time of its release and throughout its lifespan, mainly for its much higher hardware requirements and perceived slowness compared to Windows XP. \n\nPositive reviews often came from PC gamers who praised the advantages brought by DirectX 10, which allowed for better gaming performance and more realistic graphics, as well as support for many new capabilities featured in new GPUs. However, many DirectX 9 games initially ran with lower frame rates compared to when they were run on Windows XP. In mid-2008, benchmarks suggested that the SP1 update improved performance to be on par with (or better than) Windows XP in terms of game performance. \n\nPeter Bright of \"Ars Technica\" wrote that, in spite of its delays and feature cuts, Windows Vista is \"a huge evolution in the history of the NT platform [...] The fundamental changes to the platform are of a scale not seen since the release of NT [3.1; the first version].\" In a continuation of his previous assessment, Bright stated that \"Vista is not simply XP with a new skin; core parts of the OS have been radically overhauled, and virtually every area has seen significant refinement. In terms of the magnitude and extent of these changes, Vista represents probably the biggest leap that the NT platform has ever seen. Never before have significant subsystems been gutted and replaced in the way they are in Vista.\" Many others in the tech industry echoed these sentiments at the time, directing praise towards the massive amount of technical features new to Windows Vista.\n\nWindows Vista received the \"Best of CES\" award at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2007.\n\nIn its first year of availability, \"PC World\" rated it as the biggest tech disappointment of 2007, and it was rated by \"InfoWorld\" as No. 2 of Tech's all-time 25 flops. Microsoft's then much smaller competitor Apple noted that, despite Vista's far greater sales, its own operating system did not seem to have suffered after its release, and would later invest in advertising mocking Vista's unpopularity with users.\n\nComputer manufacturers such as Dell, Lenovo, and Hewlett-Packard released their newest computers with Windows Vista pre-installed; however, after the negative reception of the operating system, they also began selling their computers with Windows XP CDs included because of a drop in sales.\n\nA Gartner research report predicted that Vista business adoption in 2008 would overtake that of XP during the same time frame (21.3% vs. 16.9%) while IDC had indicated that the launch of Windows Server 2008 served as a catalyst for the stronger adoption rates. As of January 2009, Forrester Research had indicated that almost one third of North American and European corporations had started deploying Vista. At a May 2009 conference, a Microsoft Vice President said \"Adoption and deployment of Windows Vista has been slightly ahead of where we had been with XP\" for big businesses.\n\nWithin its first month, 20 million copies of Vista were sold, double the amount of Windows XP sales within its first month in October 2001, five years earlier. Shortly after however, due to Vista's relatively low adoption rates and continued demand for Windows XP, Microsoft decided to sell Windows XP until June 30, 2008, instead of the previously planned date of January 31, 2008. There were reports of Vista users \"downgrading\" their operating systems, as well as reports of businesses planning to skip Vista. A study conducted by ChangeWave in March 2008 showed that the percentage of corporate users who were \"very satisfied\" with Vista was dramatically lower than other operating systems, with Vista at 8%, compared to the 40% who said they were \"very satisfied\" with Windows XP.\n\nThe internet-usage market share for Windows Vista after two years of availability, in January 2009, was 20.61%. This figure combined with World Internet Users and Population Stats yielded a user base of roughly 330 million, which exceeded Microsoft's two-year post launch expectations by 130 million. The internet user base reached before the release of its successor (Windows 7) was roughly 400 million according to the same statistical sources.\n\nWindows Vista has received a number of negative assessments. Criticism targets include protracted development time (5–6 years), more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, and the usability of the new User Account Control security technology. Moreover, some concerns have been raised about many PCs meeting \"Vista Premium Ready\" hardware requirements and Vista's pricing.\n\nWhile in 2005 Microsoft claimed \"nearly all PCs on the market today will run Windows Vista\", the higher requirements of some of the \"premium\" features, such as the Aero interface, affected many upgraders. According to the UK newspaper \"The Times\" in May 2006, the full set of features \"would be available to less than 5 percent of Britain's PC market\"; however, this prediction was made several months before Vista was released. This continuing lack of clarity eventually led to a class action against Microsoft as people found themselves with new computers that were unable to use the new software to its full potential despite the assurance of \"Vista Capable\" designations. The court case has made public internal Microsoft communications that indicate that senior executives have also had difficulty with this issue. For example, Mike Nash (Corporate Vice President, Windows Product Management) commented, \"I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine\" because of his laptop's lack of an appropriate graphics chip so hobbled Vista.\n\nCriticism of upgrade licenses pertaining to Windows Vista Starter through Home Premium was expressed by \"Ars Technica\"s Ken Fisher, who noted that the new requirement of having a prior operating system already installed was going to cause irritation for users who reinstall Windows on a regular basis.\nIt has been revealed that an Upgrade copy of Windows Vista can be installed clean without first installing a previous version of Windows. On the first install, Windows will refuse to activate. The user must then reinstall that same copy of Vista. Vista will then activate on the reinstall, thus allowing a user to install an Upgrade of Windows Vista without owning a previous operating system. As with Windows XP, separate rules still apply to OEM versions of Vista installed on new PCs: Microsoft asserts that these versions are not legally transferable (although whether this conflicts with the right of first sale has yet to be clearly decided legally).\n\nInitially, the cost of Windows Vista was also a source of concern and commentary. A majority of users in a poll said that the prices of various Windows Vista editions posted on the Microsoft Canada website in August 2006 make the product too expensive. A BBC News report on the day of Vista's release suggested that, \"there may be a backlash from consumers over its pricing plans—with the cost of Vista versions in the US roughly half the price of equivalent versions in the UK.\"\nSince the release of Vista in 2006, Microsoft has reduced the retail, and upgrade price point of Vista. Originally, Vista Ultimate was priced at $399, and Home Premium Vista at $239. These prices have since been reduced to $319 and $199 respectively.\n\nWindows Vista supports additional forms of DRM restrictions. One aspect of this is the Protected Video Path, which is designed so that \"premium content\" from HD DVD or Blu-ray Discs may mandate that the connections between PC components be encrypted. Depending on what the content demands, the devices may not pass premium content over non-encrypted outputs, or they must artificially degrade the quality of the signal on such outputs or not display it at all. Drivers for such hardware must be approved by Microsoft; a revocation mechanism is also included, which allows Microsoft to disable drivers of devices in end-user PCs over the Internet. Peter Gutmann, security researcher and author of the open source cryptlib library, claims that these mechanisms violate fundamental rights of the user (such as fair use), unnecessarily increase the cost of hardware, and make systems less reliable (the \"tilt bit\" being a particular worry; if triggered, the entire graphic subsystem performs a reset) and vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. However, despite several requests for evidence supporting such claims Peter Gutmann has never supported his claims with any researched evidence. Proponents have claimed that Microsoft had no choice but to follow the demands of the movie studios, and that the technology will not actually be enabled until after 2010; Microsoft also noted that content protection mechanisms have existed in Windows as far back as Windows ME, and that the new protections will not apply to any existing content, only future content.\n\nAlthough User Account Control (UAC) is an important part of Vista's security infrastructure as it blocks software from silently gaining administrator privileges without the user's knowledge, it has been widely criticized for generating too many prompts. This has led many Vista UAC users to consider it troublesome, with some consequently either turning the feature off or (for Windows Vista Enterprise or Windows Vista Ultimate users) putting it in auto-approval mode. Responding to this criticism, Microsoft altered the implementation to reduce the number of prompts with SP1. Though the changes resulted in some improvement, it did not alleviate the concerns completely.\n\nSome users now argue that Windows Vista does not deserve its negative reputation. Tech YouTube personality Linus Sebastian argued in a 2018 video that issues with Windows Vista were largely due to necessary overhauls from its predecessor, Windows XP. Sebastian critiqued hardware and OEM manufacturers for unpreparedness. Many consumer-grade PCs did not meet Microsoft's hardware guidelines, and driver support suffered because developers did not develop new drivers as advised. Sebastian further noted that Vista's reputation as a \"resource hog\" (consuming excessive amounts of RAM) actually came from a misunderstanding of the new memory management model, which in fact made Vista operate more smoothly than Windows XP on appropriate hardware.\n\nEnd users of licenses of Windows 7 acquired through OEM or volume licensing may downgrade to the equivalent edition of Windows Vista. Downgrade rights are not offered for Starter, Home Basic or Home Premium editions of Windows 7. For Windows 8 licenses acquired through an OEM, a user may also downgrade to the equivalent edition of Windows Vista. Customers licensed for use of Windows 8 Enterprise are generally licensed for Windows 8 Pro, which may be downgraded to Windows Vista Business. \n\n\n"}

In 1538 it was mentioned as \"Ober Egere\".\n\nThe first church in the valley was built in 876. After 1100, the land belonged to the monastery of Einsiedeln, and was influenced by the Battle of Morgarten.\n\nThe Battle of Morgarten occurred on 15 November 1315 at Morgarten (now part of Oberägeri) and near neighboring Sattel. It began when a Swiss Confederation force of 1,500 infantry archers, led by Werner Stauffacher, ambushed a group of Austrian soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire under the command of Duke Leopold I of Austria near the Morgarten Pass. The Swiss thoroughly defeated the Austrians.\n\nThe Confederates prepared a road-block and an ambush at a point between Lake Aegeri and Morgarten Pass where a small path led between the steep slope and a swamp. When about 1500 men attacked from above with rocks, logs and halberds, the Austrian knights had no room to defend themselves and suffered a crushing defeat, while the foot soldiers in the rear fled back to the city of Zug. A chronicler described the Confederates, unfamiliar with the customs of battles between knights, as brutally butchering everything that moved and everyone unable to flee. This founded the reputation of the Confederates as barbaric, yet fierce and respectable fighters.\n\nWithin a month of the battle, in December 1315, the Confederates renewed the oath of alliance made in 1291, initiating the phase of growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy.\nWithin forty years, cities including Lucerne, Zug, Zürich and Bern had joined the confederation.\n\nThe victory of the Confederates left them in virtual autonomy and gave them a breathing-space of some sixty years before the next Habsburg attack resulted in the Battle of Sempach (1386).\nThe municipality came into existence in the 15th century. Around 1500, several chapels and the first government building were built in Oberägeri. In 1669 the municipality gained the right to elect its own priest. In 1726 the church was burgled. In 1766 the governments of Oberägeri and Unterägeri (at the time known as Wilägeri) became involved in an open fight during local parliamentary sessions, and the two municipalities split in 1798.\n\nIn 1838 the city of Zurich stopped collecting interest they had had a right to since medieval times. In the same year the first school-building in the municipality was built. The second school was not built until 1956.\n\nWater supplies were established in 1890 by a local pub landlord.\n\nOberägeri has an area, , of . Of this area, or about 0.8% is occupied with buildings and or about 2.9% is roads or transportation infrastructure. About a third or is used for agriculture, while or about 2.0% is used for small gardens. Forests or other wooded areas cover or about 37.4% of the municipality. Of the rest, or about 17.5% is covered with water, including the Ägerisee, and or about 5.7% is marsh or moorland.\n\nThe municipality is located in the eastern pre-alpine, high valley on the northern shores of the Ägerisee at an elevation of about . It consists of the village of Oberägeri and the hamlets of Morgarten/Hauptsee and Alosen (at an elevation of ) as well as scattered farm houses.\n\nOberägeri has a population (as of ) of . , 19.7% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 14.1%. Most of the population () speaks German (90.2%), with English being second most common ( 2.6%) and Dutch being third ( 1.1%).\n\nIn the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the CVP which received 33% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SVP (32.3%), the FDP (18.1%) and the Green Party (12%).\n\nIn Oberägeri about 76.9% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a \"Fachhochschule\").\n\nOberägeri has an unemployment rate of 1.14%. , there were 251 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 90 businesses involved in this sector. 355 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 44 businesses in this sector. 1,049 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 198 businesses in this sector.\n\nThe historical population is given in the following table:\n\nOberägeri is the childhood town of Swiss international rugby player, Tuomo Schurman.\n"}

The original name \"Schillerplatz\" was superseded in the early 1900s. It lies to the west of Konstablerwache with both squares linked by the Zeil, the central shopping area of the city.\n\nThe baroque building which gave the square its name was built in 1730. It was the headquarters of the city's \"Stadtwehr\" militia when Frankfurt was an independent city state (→ Free City of Frankfurt) and also contained a prison. In the 18th century Frankfurt still had city walls and its own army. Until 1864 the place surrounding the building was called \"Paradeplatz\" reflecting its military function.\n\nIn 1833 during the Frankfurter Wachensturm, the Hauptwache and the Konstablerwache were stormed in a failed effort by a small revolutionary force of native citizens, among others Gustav Koerner, and some people from different locations in Germany. When Prussia annexed the city in 1866 and took over military activities, the Hauptwache lost this role.\n\nThe prison remained and the Hauptwache also became a police station. In 1904, the building was used as a café and remains one to this day. It was the scene of the Hauptwache incident when French troops opened fire on students protesting against the French occupation of Frankfurt on 7 April 1920.\nHeavily burned in World War II bombing, it was reopened in a provisional form with an altered roof in 1954. In 1967, with the building of the U-Bahn tunnel through the city, it was dismantled so it could be moved and rebuilt over the new underground U-Bahn station. The plaza has undergone another major renovation when the S-Bahn station for suburban trains was opened in 1978.\n\nToday, Hauptwache station serves as one of the most important crosspoints of the Frankfurt public transport system. Eight of nine S-Bahn lines serve the station as well as six of nine U-Bahn lines.\n\nThe plaza has been reformed several times. Its current appearance is marked by a sunken terrace leading down to underground pedestrian area with shops and the public transport station. Frankfurters call the sunken area \"das Loch\" (). \n\nThe plaza contains a number of different architectural styles. It is towered above and dominated by St. Catherine's Church. Apart from the baroque Hauptwache itself, the surrounding buildings are mostly new architecture because of the damage from the war.\n\n\n"}

Apart from reenactment, it is also involved in research into the history of the Civil War, and education (at the school or college level) about the same.\n\nThe Sealed Knot was founded by Brigadier Peter Young, who was a military historian and a Second World War veteran. The idea of the Sealed Knot re-enactment group started at a dinner party with a small group of friends on 28 February 1968 following the publication of \"Edgehill 1642 – the Campaign and the Battle\". Within a few months it had 200 members and today has a membership of several thousand, making it the largest re-enactment society in Europe. The group is a registered charity, and has its own coat of arms. \n\nWith its large membership and high profile the Sealed Knot is the largest and best known of all the many re-enactment and historical groups and societies in the UK. Its official journal, \"Orders of the Day\", is published every two months and sent to all members. It contains information about forthcoming events. Copies of every issue are lodged with the British Library.\n\nThe Sealed Knot comprises a number of regiments split into Parliamentarian, Royalist and Scots armies. The group was responsible for the first commemoration in 1971 of the Battle of Nantwich (which originally took place in 1644) and in 1973 the Sealed Knot staged the first re-enactment of the battle, which has now become an annual event at the end of January and is known as \"Holly Holy Day\".\n\nThe Sealed Knot is made up of smaller groups, each run semi-autonomously, and known to their members as \"regiments\", their names and identities closely linked to regiments that took part in the English Civil War. Each of these regiments falls under one of the armies of the society: the Royalist Army, the Army of Parliament and the Army of Ireland and Scotland. The other sections are those who deal with pyrotechnics, the medical service, the living history group and Friends of the Knot.\n\nThe Sealed Knot is parodied as \"The Peeled Nuts\" in the \"Discworld\" series of novels by Terry Pratchett. It has also been parodied in Chris Morris' \"On The Hour\", where it is referred to as \"The Soiled Nut\". Half Man Half Biscuit's song \"Uffington Wassail\" on their 2000 album \"Trouble over Bridgwater\" challenges the Society to re-enact \"Luton Town – Millwall, nineteen eighty-five\", a notorious incident of football hooliganism involving rival supporters.\n\n\n"}

He led a successful legal battle to publish the uncensored version of D. H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", and later was the American publisher of Henry Miller's controversial novel \"Tropic of Cancer\". The right to publish and distribute Miller's novel in the United States was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1964, in a landmark ruling for free speech and the First Amendment.\n\nRosset was born and raised in Chicago to a Jewish father, Barnet Rosset, and an Irish Catholic mother, Mary (née Tansey). He attended the progressive Francis Parker School, where he was best friends with renowned cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Rosset also said that Robert Morss Lovett, the grandfather of Rosset's high school sweetheart, and professor of English at the University of Chicago had been a great influence on him.\n\nRosset attended Swarthmore College for one year and then enlisted in the army in 1942. It was at Swarthmore that Rosset discovered the work of Henry Miller.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the Army Signal Corps as an officer in a photographic company stationed in Kunming, China. In 2002, Rosset exhibited a collection of his War Photographs from his time in China in a New York Gallery. The exhibit included graphic photos of wounded and dead Chiang Kai-shek soldiers.\n\nRosset's initial ambition was to be a filmmaker like his childhood friend Haskell Wexler. Rosset produced a documentary called \"Strange Victory\" about racism in a post World War II America. The film was a failure.\n\nAfter divorcing his first wife, painter Joan Mitchell, Rosset took courses at the New School for Social Research and worked for \"Monthly Review Press\" magazine. A friend of Joan Mitchell's told Rosset about Grove Press and that the original founders wanted to sell. Rosset purchased Grove Press for three thousand dollars.\n\nRosset married five times. Rosset married American Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell in France in 1949. The couple settled in Greenwich Village but then later divorced. Mitchell was instrumental in Rosset's acquisition of Grove Press.\n\nRosset's second wife was Loly Eckert, a sales manager at Grove Press. They had a son named Peter Rosset.\n\nHe owned an East Hampton, Long Island quonset hut, previously used as a studio by painter Robert Motherwell.\n\nHis final marriage was to Astrid Meyers.\n\nRosset had three more children after Peter, son Beckett (named for Samuel Beckett) and two daughters—Tansey and Chantal.\n\nRosset introduced American readers to numerous significant writers, including Samuel Beckett (Nobel Prize in Literature 1969), Pablo Neruda (Nobel Prize 1971), Octavio Paz (Nobel Prize 1990), Kenzaburō Ōe (Nobel Prize 1994), Harold Pinter (Nobel Prize 2005), Henry Miller, William S.

Andromachus was the son of Achaeus who was a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Anatolia. His family was influential in Anatolia and had strong royal connections. Andromachus had three siblings; one brother: Alexander and two sisters: Antiochis and Laodice I. Andromachus was the father of Achaeus and his sister Laodice II was married to the Seleucid King Seleucus II Callinicus. As a result of this marriage, the future Seleucid kings, Seleucus III Ceraunus and Antiochus III the Great, were his nephews.\n\nDuring the course of a war between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, the Egyptian king Ptolemy III Euergetes took Andromachus prisoner; and when Ptolemy III died in 221 BC, Andromachus was still a prisoner in Egypt. Since Achaeus was anxious to secure his father's release, Ptolemy IV of Egypt’s chief advisor, Sosibius, regarded the captive nobleman as a very valuable piece to play in the political game. He had, perhaps, before the revolt of Achaeus, tried to strike a bargain with him—the release of Andromachus as the price for Achaeus deserting the Seleucid king. When Achaeus did revolt, pushed by other circumstances, and without having made any compact with Egypt, there was even less reason to let Andromachus go. Sosibius was very unwilling to part with such a valuable individual; but around 220 BC the Rhodians intervened on behalf of Achaeus, changing the situation radically.\n\nThe Rhodians' decision did not spring from altruism. It was a move with which they hoped to defeat the city-state of Byzantium, with which they were at war. Byzantium hoped to gain Achaeus' support against Rhodes and its allies. By obtaining Andromachus' release the Rhodians planned to foil the Byzantine plan and obtain Achaeus' support. They therefore sent an embassy to Ptolemy IV asking him to deliver Andromachus to them. While Ptolemy at first refused to free Andromachus, with further consideration, being anxious to please the Rhodians, the king yielded to their request and handed over Andromachus to them. This was done, and father and son were reunited. After these events, Andromachus disappears from history.\n\n"}

In the July 1949, a repair service center attached to the East China Field Army (which later became the Third Field Army) took control of an automobile workshop in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, former capital of the Republic of China, after the Red Army had conquered the city.\n\nIn the 1950s, oversight of the small automobile workshop that would become Nanjing Automobile was transferred to China's First Ministry of Industrial Machinery. It began making China's first domestically produced light-duty trucks in 1958, the 2½ ton NJ-130, based on the GAZ-51 from Russia. The Ministry branded the truck \"Guerin\" (跃进牌汽车 - literally meaning \"Leap Forward\") and approved the establishment of Nanjing Automobile Works that same year. Truck production continued until July 1987 at which point 161,988 units of various models including the NJ-130, NJ-230, NJ-135, and NJ-134 had been built.\n\n\"Guerin\" later became Yue Jin while the Mandarin name remains \"跃进\".\n\nNanjing Auto has repeatedly used technology transfers to make the company more competitive.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Nanjing Auto purchased designs and moulds from Isuzu and obtained technology from the Italian Iveco, the commercial vehicle unit of Fiat, participating in a spate of technology transfer deals circa 1980 that saw Japanese designs and machinery sold to Chinese buyers.\n\nThe Iveco purchases allowed Nanjing Auto to produce a version of the Iveco Daily.\n\nIn 1999 the design, and possibly the tooling, for SEAT's first generation Ibiza was purchased and the car sold in China as the Nanjing Yuejin Soyat.\n\nNanjing Auto acquired some assets of MG Rover Group and Powertrain Ltd in 2005 after the group had entered administration. According to the purchase agreement, Nanjing Auto bought MG, Austin, and some other dormant British car brands, and the production technology and equipment for the MG ZT and MG TF models. Some equipment and blueprints were repossessed by Honda, as its intellectual property is used in some of MG Rover vehicles, in particular, the Rover 45 and MG ZS, which were based on the Honda Domani.\n\nNanjing Auto decided to establish production bases for MGs at Longbridge and Nanjing. A plan to open another factory in Ardmore, Oklahoma, USA was not realized. The production of engines, transmissions and medium and low end vehicle products would be transferred to China, where a supply chain would also be set up. A production facility would be retained in the UK, with the original Longbridge site integrated to resume the production of MG TF sport cars. Meanwhile, by making use of the R&D capability and personnel in the UK as well as that of China, the Euro IV engines and a new generation of vehicles would be developed and then produced in both China and the UK.\n\nIn 2007, Nanjing Auto planned to build 13,000 cars based on the Rover 75 / MG ZT sedan, renamed MG 7. These cars would be mostly sedans (saloons), plus some MG 7T estate cars. It also planned 3,000 MG TF convertible sports cars.\n\nThe MG Factory of Nanjing Auto is located in the High-level New Technology Economic Development Zone in Pukou (a new district of Nanjing). The capacity of the Nanjing-MG Factory will reach 200,000 autos, 250,000 engines and 100,000 gear-boxes.\n\nThe initial MG range consisted of just the MG 7 and the MG TF. Nanjing Auto also started production of the Rover Streetwise-based MG 3SW in 2008.\n\nThe plant at Longbridge was for many years one of the most important car making factories in Europe as well as the largest British-owned car manufacturing plant, making Austin cars for most of the 20th century. After the Abingdon plant closed in 1980, Longbridge was also from 1982 the home of MG and then of the Rover marque which gradually replaced Austin in the late 1980s.\n\nThe site is owned by St. Modwen Properties which acquired in two deals in 2003 and 2004 for £57.5 million and leased it back to MG Rover Group. A 33-year deal was signed in February 2006 between Nanjing Auto and St. Modwen Properties covering the lease of 105 acres (a quarter of the total area of the Longbridge plant) but including the two main car assembly plants, the paint shop and administrative offices at a rent of around £1.8 million a year. £10 million was estimated to be needed to reopen the factory.\n\nWith the merger of Nanjing Auto and SAIC, ownership of the Longbridge plant became a SAIC controlled facility.\n\nChang Da (畅达) is an NEV sub-brand of Nanjing Automobile and SAIC. Established in 2009, Chang Da has been developing electric light logistics vans for \"the last mile\" delivery. The first product, Chang Da H9 is based on the structure of FAW Jiabao V80 (佳宝V80) and took three years to develop before being launched in 2017. The Chang Da H9 could be either bought or leased in fleets.\nNanjing Auto has had at least two joint ventures with the Italian automaker Fiat. A 50/50 joint venture set up in 1999 that collapsed sometime in 2007 and Naveco, a joint venture with Fiat's commercial vehicles unit, Iveco, established in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Nanjing Auto established Naveco (Nanjing Iveco Automobile Co Ltd) with Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles unit. The joint venture initially manufactured a version of the Iveco Daily for sale in the Chinese market, and, as of 1995, it continued to make light trucks but had added diesel engines as well.\n\nThe company acquired the truck manufacturing assets of Yuejin Motor Co sometime in 2007.\n\nIn July 2017, Naveco started production of the new Iveco China Daily in the new factory of Qiaolin, Nanjing\n\nNaveco products include are listed below:\n\nAnother joint venture was Nanjing Fiat, established with Fiat in 1999. This Italian automaker quit the company in 2007 citing a lack of investment on the part of its Chinese partner.\n\nAs of 2006, it was producing four models: the Perla and Siena sedans, Palio, compact and Palio Weekend station wagon. Most of Nanjing Fiat's design and tooling was taken over by Zotye in 2008.\n\nThe company was located in the Jiangning District's Economic & Technological Development Zone in Nanjing.\n\nAs the company further developed its management, four complete production ecosystems were created.\n\nA major manufacturing base of Nanjing Auto, it makes light-duty trucks under the \"Yuejin\" brand. The production of Isuzu-based SUVs and pickups was transferred to the Wuxi Soyat branch in 2005.\n\nSometime in 2007, Yuejin's truck-making business was merged with the Iveco-Nanjing Auto joint venture Naveco, which continued to sell under the \"Yuejin\" brand.\n\nLocated in an economic development zone in Huishan District, Wuxi, (about 150 km east of Nanjing) the Wuxi Branch of Yuejin Automobile Co is a Nanjing Auto production base, and it may be the newest having been built sometime after 2003. Production of the Junda SUVs and pickups was taken over from Nanjing's Yuejin brand in 2005. By 2008, after SAIC's takeover of Nanjing, Wuxi Soyat production came to a halt. The factory is now used by SAIC to build the Maxus commercial van.\n\nCar brands owned by Nanjing Auto include:\n\nSometime before the 1980s, Nanjing Auto was under the joint jurisdiction of both the central and local governments. As of 2003, this vehicle manufacturer was owned by Yuejin Automobile Group of Jiangsu, which held just over fifty-per cent ownership of the company at this time, and two State firms created to dispose of non-performing bank loans, China Huarong Asset Management and China Cinda Asset Management.\nNanjing Auto is now a subsidiary of SAIC, having been merged with the much larger automaker in 2007.\n\nA result of Chinese State policy to encourage mergers and acquisitions in the domestic automobile market, SAIC Motor and the state-owned parent company of Nanjing Auto, Yuejin Automotive Group, finalized a long-planned merger in December 2007. Fitful merger negotiations between the two companies had begun in 2001, and the tie-up was widely anticipated. Prior to the merger, but bidding alongside SAIC, Nanjing Auto purchased the remaining assets of British group MG Rover for near US$100 million.\n\n\n"}

Lacroix's path to mathematics started with the novel Robinson Crusoe. That gave him an interest in sailing and thus navigation too. At that point geometry captured his interest and the rest of mathematics followed. He had courses with Antoine-René Mauduit at College Royale de France and Joseph-Francois Marie at Collége Mazaine of University of Paris. In 1779 he obtained some lunar observations of Pierre Charles Le Monnier and began to calculate the variables of lunar theory. The next year he followed some lectures of Gaspard Monge.\n\nIn 1782 at the age of 17 he became an instructor in mathematics at the École de Gardes de la Marine in Rochefort. Monge was the students' examiner and Lacroix's supervisor there until 1795. Returning to Paris, Condorcet hired Lacroix to fill in for him as instructor of gentlemen at a Paris lycée. In 1787 he began to teach at École Royale Militaire de Paris and he married Marie Nicole Sophie Arcambal.\n\nIn Besançon, from 1788, he taught courses at the \"École Royale d'Artillerie\" under examiner Pierre-Simon Laplace. The posting in Besançon lasted until 1793 when Lacroix returned to Paris.\n\nIt was the best of times and the worst of times: Lavoisier had opened inquiry into \"new chemistry\", a subject Lacroix studied with Jean Henri Hassenfratz. He also joined Societe Philomatique de Paris which provided a journal in which to communicate his findings. On the other hand, Paris was in the grip of the Reign of Terror. In 1794 Lacroix became director of the Executive Committee for Public Instruction. In this position he promoted École Normale and the system of Écoles Centrales. In 1795 he taught at École Central des Quatres-Nations. \n\nThe first volume \"Traité du Calcul Différentiel et du Calcul Intégral\" was published in 1797. Legendre predicted that it \"will make itself conspicuous by the choice of methods, their generality, and the rigor of the demonstrations.\" In hindsight Ivor Grattan-Guinness observed:\n\nIn 1799, he became professor of analysis at École Polytechnique.\n\nLacroix was the author of at least 17 biographies contributed to \"Biographie Universalle\" compiled by Louis Gabriel Michaud. \n\nIn 1809, he was admitted to Faculté des Sciences de Paris.\n\nIn 1812, he began teaching at the Collège de France, and was appointed chair of mathematics in 1815.\n\nWhen a second edition of the \"Traité du Calcul Différentiel et du Calcul Intégral\" was published in three volumes in 1810, 1814, and 1819, Lacroix renewed the text:\n\nDuring his career, he produced a number of important textbooks in mathematics. Translations of these books into the English language were used in British universities, and the books remained in circulation for nearly 50 years.\n\nIn 1812, Babbage set up \"The Analytical Society\" for the translation of \"Differential and Integral Calculus\" and the book was translated into English in 1816 by George Peacock.\n\nLacroix crater on the Moon was named for him.\n\n\n"}

His search leads him to \"Hakone Pacific Land\", a holiday resort where the youths were last seen together exactly one week before their deaths. Once there, he happens upon a mysterious unmarked videotape. Watching the tape, he witnesses a strange sequence of both abstract and realistic footage, including an image of an injured man, that ends with a warning revealing the viewer has a week to live. Giving a single means of avoiding death, the tape's explanation ends suddenly having been overwritten by an advertisement. The tape has a horrible mental effect on Asakawa, and he does not doubt for a second that its warning is true.\n\nReturning to Tokyo with no idea how to avert his fate, Asakawa enlists the help of his curious friend Ryūji Takayama, an apparent psychopath who openly jests that he engages in rape. As soon as Asakawa explains the story, Takayama believes him, and insists on seeing the tape. Asakawa shows it to him and although Takayama remains cool and nonchalant, he agrees that there is a powerful aura around it, and asks Asakawa to make him a copy to study at home, which Asakawa does.\n\nRacing against the deadline, both men begin investigating the tape. By following the imagery from the tape, Ryūji deduces that the rapid strobe seen during certain sequences show the recording device was \"blinking\". The duo then connect this, as well as the significance of certain tape images, and learn of Sadako Yamamura, a young woman capable of technopathic feats (such as projecting mental images onto televisions) who mysteriously vanished thirty years previously. Believing Sadako is connected to the tape, Asakawa also soon learns that, after carelessly leaving the tape in his home, his wife and infant daughter viewed the tape and now have seven days to live.\n\nLearning of an isolated sanatorium Sadako frequented when her father contracted tuberculosis, Asakawa arranges a meeting with Nagao Jotaro, a doctor at the now-closed hospital. Recognizing him as the injured man from the tape sequences, Ryūji aggressively presses Dr. Jotaro for answers; the doctor, buckling under pressure, explains that he was infatuated with Sadako, and raped her in the woods near to the hospital. Infecting her with smallpox he unknowingly contracted, Jotaro was injured during a struggle (during which he learned Sadako was intersex), resulting in the doctor throwing Sadako into a nearby well before crushing her with rocks.\n\nBelieving Sadako's rage and psychic powers resulted in the images projected onto the tape, Asakawa and Ryūji head for the well where she was killed. Figuring the well is located beneath the lodge where the tape was located, the duo locates the well and Asakawa lowers himself inside, finding Sadako's remains. Recovering and giving her remains a burial, Asakawa passes his deadline, confirming his curse has ended. When Ryūji dies of a heart attack the next day, however, the true nature of the tapes are revealed: Sadako's rage caused her psychic powers to combine with the smallpox virus in her body, creating a paranormal phenomenon that is activated when the tape is viewed. Demanding the viewer replicate the tape, the curse is propagated like a virus through tape copies, sparing anyone who copies it; since Asakawa duplicated the tape at Ryūji's request, he now must make his wife and daughter do the same, lest they die.\n\n\nFollowing the publication of the book several adaptations were made, including a manga adaptation of the novel which was released in 1996 by Kouhirou Nagai. In 1999, a second manga was made by Misao Inagaki which took elements from the novel, film and television versions of the \"Ring\".\n\n\n\nThere are many key differences between the \"Ring\" novel and the 1998 film adaptation. Most notably, Asakawa in the novel is a man named Kazuyuki, while in the film, Asakawa is a woman named Reiko (whose name may have been a nod to Kaoru Futami's girlfriend in \"Loop\"). Kazuyuki has a wife and daughter; Reiko is divorced (from Ryuji), and she has a son named Yoichi. Kazuyuki is a newspaper proofreader, demoted for reporter over a failed story about the supernatural involving Ryuji; Reiko is a TV reporter.\n\n"}

Server-side software is typically used by enterprises to protect their customers and employees who use internal or private web-based systems from being pharmed and phished, while browser add-ins allow individual users to protect themselves from phishing. DNS protection mechanisms help ensure that a specific DNS server cannot be hacked and thereby become a facilitator of pharming attacks. Spam filters typically do not provide users with protection against pharming.\n\nCurrently the most efficient way to prevent pharming is for end users to make sure they are using secure web connections (HTTPS) to access privacy sensitive sites such as those for banking or taxing, and only accept the valid public key certificates issued by trusted sources. A certificate from an unknown organisation or an expired certificate should not be accepted all the time for crucial business. So-called active cookies provide for a server-side detection tool. \n\nLegislation also plays an essential role in anti-pharming. In March 2005, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Anti-Phishing Act of 2005, a bill that proposes a five-year prison sentence and/or fine for individuals who execute phishing attacks and use information garnered through online fraud such as phishing and pharming to commit crimes such as identity theft.\n\nFor home users of consumer-grade routers and wireless access points, perhaps the single most effective defense is to change the password on the router to something other than the default, replacing it with a password that is not susceptible to a dictionary attack.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2289761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289761", "title": "Big Generator", "text": "Big Generator\n\nBig Generator is the twelfth studio album by the English rock band Yes, released on 21 September 1987 by Atco Records. After touring worldwide in support of their previous album, \"90125\" (1983), which saw the band move from progressive rock towards a pop-oriented and commercially accessible direction, Yes started work on a follow-up in 1985 with producer Trevor Horn. It was a laborious album to make; recording began at Carimate, Italy, but internal and creative differences resulted in production to resume in London, where Horn ended his time with the band due to continuing problems. The album was completed in Los Angeles in 1987 by Rabin and producer Paul DeVilliers.\n\n\"Big Generator\" received some mixed reviews from music critics, and the album reached number 15 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. In April 1988, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling one million copies in the US. Like \"90125\", it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The album spawned three singles, \"Love Will Find a Way\", \"Rhythm of Love\", and \"Final Eyes\". Yes supported \"Big Generator\" with a tour of North America and Japan from November 1987 to April 1988, after which Anderson left the group. The album was reissued in 2009 with bonus tracks.\n\nIn February 1985, Yes – comprising vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Tony Kaye, drummer Alan White, and guitarist and vocalist Trevor Rabin – ended a twelve-month world tour in support of their eleventh studio album, \"90125\" (1983). That album marked a considerable change in direction for the group, moving from their pioneering progressive rock sound of the 1970s towards more accessible and pop-oriented music, helped by the production of Trevor Horn and Rabin's demos, which formed most the songs. \"90125\" became the band's highest selling album, largely thanks to the US number one \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and earned the band their first and only Grammy: the Best Rock Instrumental Performance, for \"Cinema\".\n\nIn 1985, Yes entered plans for their next studio album with Horn resuming his role as producer. Rabin felt nervous and pressured when their label, Atco Records, informed him that they wished for another hit like \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", but he wished to move from the band's past and do something different regardless of its success. At Rabin's suggestion, the band agreed to relocate to Lark Recording Studios, a facility situated by Castello di Carimate, a castle in Carimate, Italy. He thought that such a location would help the band bond together and bring some new ideas to the music which would create a better album as a result. Rabin first spoke of the friction between Anderson and Squire during this time three years after the album's release, which suited him as it \"created a great vacuum for me to work in\". Squire maintained that Rabin made the choice to record there as a step to save money and for tax purposes, and called it the wrong move, a view that Rabin denied years later and clarified that \"It was never the intention to save money, although I don't want to waste money.\" Squire recalled more time being spent on what recording equipment to use than the music itself during the entire project, which also affected the tense situation.\n\nAfter three months in Carimate, most of the backing tracks had been put down but progress on the album was affected by internal problems. Rabin recalled a lot of partying going on and not enough substantial work getting done, calling it \"a real drug time\" which affected unnamed members to focus on work. This led to Horn suggesting they halt production and resume in London. For the next several months, recording took place at SARM East, SARM West, and AIR Studios in London. However, when the move was not enough to improve internal relations and differences in the album's direction, Rabin felt it was time to relocate the recording once more, this time to Los Angeles where he had settled, when he once entered the studio by himself on a Sunday to work, and later found it the happiest time of the entire experience. While in London, Horn found himself unable to finish producing the tracks as the band could not agree and ended his association with the project, adding: \"It wasn't a case of being a committee. It was just warring factions trying to kill each other\". Rabin later revealed that Horn's departure was also partly due to his differences with Anderson and Kaye.\n\nAfter failing to finish the album in London, Rabin returned home to Los Angeles and completed it at Southcombe, Westlake, and Sunset Sound Studios with producer and engineer Paul DeVilliers. Rabin also worked on the album with a 24-track studio at his home studio in the Hollywood Hills, which inspired him to work on all of his musical projects in the studio which he named The Jacaranda Room, since 1988. Rabin estimated the album cost $2 million to make.\n\nAt the beginning of the songwriting process, Rabin recalled the group used \"Abbey Road\" (1969) by The Beatles as a model and influence for the music on \"Big Generator\". He explained: \"If we come up with an idea, why pressure ourselves into making it a song? Just have it there. If you can't come up with a chorus, don't throw it out because it's not a complete song and don't put a bad chorus around it\". Such an approach led to the album having tracks longer than common pop songs of the time, peaking at seven minutes in length. Rabin described Kaye's role as a greater one than he had on \"90125\", but continual clashes between Kaye and Horn resulted in his keyboard parts being recorded in another studio away from Horn.\n\nThe idea behind \"Rhythm of Love\" is, according to Rabin, \"just sex\". By the time of the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and thought a sex lyric would be a \"nice little tease\". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics \"fashioned\" and changed some words.\n\n\"Big Generator\" is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some \"Yes stamps\" incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. \"I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time\". Once he was, \"I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three\".\n\n\"Shoot High Aim Low\", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as \"the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up\", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as \"To live beyond war\". Rabin later called the song his favourite on \"Big Generator\".\n\nRabin called \"Almost Like Love\" a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed with the addition of a horn section, comparing it to soul music and \"Sussudio\" by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like \"polishing a vase while the building was falling down\".\n\n\"Love Will Find a Way\" is solely credited to Rabin. He had originally worked on the music and lyrics with singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks and was close to recording it with her, but White heard the song and suggested Yes record it for \"Big Generator\". Rabin was a fan of the song's title lyric, and particularly enjoyed conducting the orchestral arrangement at the beginning. However, he found that some fans thought the song was too far from what Yes music stood for.\n\nRabin enjoyed working on the production and arrangement for \"Final Eyes\", but deemed it a particularly difficult song to make, owing to its many changes in mood and style, yet he liked the acoustic guitar with Anderson's vocals.\n\n\"I'm Running\" is the last of three group-written tracks, and was recorded at SARM Studios in London. When a take had been put down, Rabin recalled, White's drum tracks were deemed unusable, leaving him to re-record his parts \"note for note\". Rabin took a riff that Squire had come up with which he was uncomfortable, but developed a guitar part that had a Latin flavour. He was not completely happy with the song, but thought its strange quality made him like it.\n\n\"Holy Lamb (Song for Harmonic Convergence)\" originated by Anderson and deals with Harmonic Convergence, one of the world's first synchronised meditation events that occurred in August 1987 and raised awareness of a specific alignment of the planets at that time. Anderson had met some spiritual people during a visit to Las Vegas several years prior to writing it, and told him that he would be singing about it.\n\n\"Jon Anderson had an idea for that sleeve, which was basically a drawing of a scroll,\" designer Garry Mouat (who had worked on \"90125\") told \"Classic Rock\". \"It was like something you may have done at school. I remember saying, 'I like where you're coming from, but how about another idea?' The band were all looking out of the windows, avoiding eye contact and leaving me to pay lip service to Jon.\"\n\nReleased on 21 September 1987, \"Big Generator\" peaked at number 15 on the \"Billboard\" 200 during 30 weeks on the chart, and number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. On 8 December 1987, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 500,000 copies in the US. On 29 April 1988, it was certified platinum for selling one million copies. Like \"90125\", the album earned Yes a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nThree singles were released from the album. \"Love Will Find a Way\", the first, reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart and number 30 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The second, \"Rhythm of Love\", peaked at number 40 on the latter chart. In 1988, \"Final Eyes\" was released as the third single.\n\n\"Big Generator\" was remastered in 2009 by Japanese producer Isao Kikuchi and released in Japan by Warner Music Japan as part of a series of Yes reissues on Super High Material CD. A remastered album was included in the compilation box set \"The Studio Albums 1969–1987\" (2013).\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nYes\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n\nBooks\n"}

{"id": "2289768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289768", "title": "The King of Marvin Gardens", "text": "The King of Marvin Gardens\n\nThe King of Marvin Gardens is a 1972 American drama film. It stars Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Ellen Burstyn and Scatman Crothers. It is one of several collaborations between Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson. The majority of the film is set in a wintry Atlantic City, New Jersey, with cinematography by László Kovács.\n\nThe title alludes to the Marven Gardens in Margate, New Jersey as well as to one of the properties in the original \"Monopoly\" game, which was based on the streets of Atlantic City.\n\nDavid and Jason are brothers, the former a depressive living with his grandfather in Philadelphia where he runs a late-night radio talk show and the latter an extrovert con man working for gang boss Lewis in Atlantic City, where he lives with the manic-depressive Sally, former beauty queen and prostitute, and her stepdaughter Jessica, who entertained men alongside her mother. After no contact for eighteen months, Jason asks David to come to Atlantic City for an opportunity to \"make our fortune\". David arrives and, after he is bailed out of jail, Jason persuades him to stay on in his hotel suite with the two women. He explains his scheme for a casino in Hawaii and tells him that they will share the girls when they go there. \n\nTensions grow among the four as Jason seeks unsuccessfully to involve a Japanese syndicate of investors in his plans. The skeptical David has no faith in Jason's plan, while Jason chides David for wallowing in his dark, lonely depressed life. Jessica is being groomed for a beauty queen career by Sally in another improbable scheme but develops a mutual attraction with Jason. Sally, increasingly neurotic over losing her looks, burns her glamorous clothes, cuts off her hair and throws away her cosmetics. Jason starts packing to leave for Hawaii and tells Sally that he is going with Jessica and that she cannot come. Sally threatens to shoot David or Jason and, when Jason mocks her, shoots him dead in rage and despair. David escorts his brother's corpse home to Philadelphia by train.\n\nThe film has several surreal scenes, including a conversation on horseback between David and Jason and a simulated Miss America Pageant. The latter scene was filmed in the empty Atlantic City Convention Hall (now called Boardwalk Hall), which was at the time of its 1929 construction the largest clear-span covered space in the world. During the scene, Ellen Burstyn is shown playing the hall's historic pipe organ, which is the world's largest organ and reputedly the largest and loudest musical instrument ever built.\n\n\"The King of Marvin Gardens\" was shot almost entirely on location in Atlantic City in the winter months of 1972. It is therefore of considerable historical significance as a visual record of the very last days of the city's \"classic era\" resort architecture. Many of the grand hotels shown in the film's exterior scenes were demolished during the next few years to make way for the new generation of casino-hotels that were built after the legalization of gambling. Filming took place only months before the vast Traymore Hotel was explosively demolished in April 1972, and the movie's main location, the opulent Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel was demolished in 1978 to make way for Bally's Atlantic City.\n\nThe title of the film (which was originally to be called \"The Philosopher King\") is an ironic reference to the original version of the board game \"Monopoly\", in which the main properties were named after locations in Atlantic City. This reference was also reflected in the film's original poster art.\n\nThe film was one of several collaborations between Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson, which included the Monkees film \"Head\" (1968) and \"Five Easy Pieces\" (1970), which established both men as major figures in Hollywood. Dern and Nicholson had previously worked together in \"Psych-Out\" (1968) and \"The Rebel Rousers\" (1970). Scatman Crothers subsequently co-starred, with Nicholson in the lead role, in Miloš Forman's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975) and Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (1980). Co-star Ellen Burstyn had previously worked in the TV series \"Gunsmoke\", in which Dern had also appeared, and would soon achieve worldwide fame with her starring role in William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" (1973).\n\nThe film was one of the few screen appearances made by Julia Anne Robinson (Jessica), who died in an apartment fire in Eugene, Oregon in 1975, aged 24.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, calling it \"an original, individual, and often frustrating movie that takes a lot of chances and wins on about sixty percent of them.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" also awarded three stars out of four, writing that \"much of the film doesn't work\" but it \"contains three of the best performances of the year.\" \n\nRoger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" panned the film, writing that \"Rafelson's kind of poetic realism, an accuracy in the treatment of unexpected settings, looked like quality to some in 'Five Easy Pieces' two years back. Now it looks like the most pretentious of clichés, a low-keyed but very empty bombast exploiting rather than exploring its themes of failed dreams and tawdry realities.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a curious, stunningly cinematic, intricately structured, intensely atmospheric new film,\" adding, \"There seems no end to the season's really extraordinary acting jobs and 'Marvin Gardens' gives us five—count 'em five.\" Richard Combs of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote \"Brilliantly constructed by Rafelson and screenwriter Jacob Brackman as a fable of imperfect lives in which nothing ever comes to fruition, \"The King of Marvin Gardens\" creates a fragmented, incomplete puzzle (with visual and verbal puns slyly hinting that there might be a key), a game in which no one finally sweeps the board.\"\n\n\"The King of Marvin Gardens\" holds a rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews.\n\n\n"}

Total production was 431 units. \n\nThe first three RS-11s were produced by ALCO in February 1956 as a demonstrator set. This locomotive, classified by ALCO as model DL-701, was their first high-horsepower road switcher, intended to be a replacement for the very popular RS-3 road switcher. Featuring a V-12, 251B diesel engine, the RS-11 was ALCO's answer to EMD's very successful GP9. The turbocharged RS-11 accelerated faster, had a higher tractive effort rating and typically used less fuel than the competition. It was also quite versatile and could be found in heavy haul freight as well as passenger service. It was produced in high-nose and low-nose versions. Montreal Locomotive Works also built nearly identical units, known as the RS-18, predominantly for the Canadian market.\n\nWhile the RS-11 benefited from the increased power and reliability offered with ALCO's new 251B engine, and was arguably a more advanced product than the GP9, its market acceptance was disappointing against the reputation EMD's locomotives had made for superior reliability.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2289772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289772", "title": "Maudsley Hospital", "text": "Maudsley Hospital\n\nThe Maudsley Hospital is a British psychiatric hospital in south London. The Maudsley is the largest mental health training institution in the UK. It is part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and works in partnership with the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. The hospital was one of the originating institutions in producing the \"Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines\". It is part of the King's Health Partners academic health science centre and the National Institute for Health Research (‘NIHR’) Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health.\n\nThe Maudsley story dates from 1907, when once leading Victorian psychiatrist Henry Maudsley offered London County Council £30,000 (apparently earned from lucrative private practice in the West End) to help found a new mental hospital that would be exclusively for early and acute cases rather than chronic cases, have an out-patients' clinic and provide for teaching and research. Maudsley's associate Frederick Walker Mott had proposed the original idea and he conducted the negotiations, with Maudsley remaining anonymous until the offer was accepted. Mott, a neuropathologist, had been influenced by a visit to Emil Kraepelin's psychiatric clinic with attached postgraduate teaching facilities in Munich, Germany. The Council agreed to contribute half the building costs - eventually rising to £70,000 - and then covered the running costs which were almost twice as high per bed as the large asylums. The hospital also incorporated the Central Pathological Laboratory, transferred from Claybury Hospital, run by Mott. Construction of the hospital was completed in 1915. An Act of Parliament had to be obtained, that year, to allow the institution to accept voluntary patients without needing to certify them as insane.\nHowever before it could open, the building was requisitioned to treat war veterans. After the war it was returned to the control of London County Council and it finally opened as the Maudsley Hospital in February 1923. The first superintendent was psychiatrist Edward Mapother, while Frederick Golla took over the running of the pathology lab from Mott. Both were more sceptical of the Kraepelinian categories of diagnosis, and took a more pragmatic and eclectic view on causation and treatment. Psychiatrist Mary Barkas worked here between 1923 and 1927 in the children's department established by William Dawson.\nIn the interwar period the Maudsley Hospital engaged in widespread experimentation with animal hormones, both in small doses to rectify supposed deficits and in overdoses as a shock therapy. Numerous psychoactive drugs and procedures were tried out, in what has been described as 'unconstrained experimentation'. One of those involved, as a trainee and then junior doctor, was the controversial William Sargant. The hospital's nursing staff comprised a matron, assistant matron, six sisters and 19 staff nurses with at least three years general hospital training, supported by 23 probationers and 12 male nurses. It had a good reputation for training nurses and some applicants even travelled overseas to train there. A report (held at Bethlem's Archives & Museum) from a nurse who trained at the Maudsley shows some of the work of a new trainee: \"Apart from observation and simple treatment, nurses are trained in special investigations and therapy. They carry out many of the routine psychometric tests, help as technicians in the ward laboratories, and are instructors in occupational therapy\".\nThe Maudsley Hospital Medical School was established in 1924 and eventually became a well-respected teaching centre. In 1932, Mapother described it as \"the main postgraduate school of mental medicine in England.\" The Maudsley Hospital had initially struggled to secure funding from the Medical Research Council, and, to undertake further research and develop the Medical School, but a substantial grant was obtained in 1938 from American charity the Rockefeller Foundation. Originally, there was no provision for the treatment of children and the rapid growth in this patient population was unforeseen. A child guidance clinic was set up under the directorship of Dr William Moodie, the deputy medical superintendent, in 1928. The late 1920s and 1930s saw a rapid growth in the number of patients treated: this growth led to an ongoing building programme including a secure unit, completed in 1931, and an out-patients department, completed in 1933.\n\nBoth Mapother and then deputy Aubrey Lewis supported involuntary eugenic sterilisation, unequivocally recommending it to the Brock Committee in 1932. Lewis was a member of the Eugenics Society and a 1934 chapter he authored is \"remarkable for its total admiration for the German work and workers\". With the spread of National Socialist (Nazi) laws in Germany from 1933, however, they decried the Nazi conflation of therapy and punishment, a move partly attributed to political and funding expediency. The Maudsley maintained its links with Germany, taking on both pro-Nazis and Jewish emigres through fellowships provided by the Commonwealth Fund and, after 1935, large scale funds from the American Rockefeller Foundation. Eliot Slater continued to visit Munich through the 1930s and contributed to academic festivities honouring Nazi eugenicist Ernst Rudin. During this time, Maudsley psychiatry developed a distinctive combination of practical experimentation and intellectual scepticism. Influential psychiatrist Aubrey Lewis became clinical director of the Maudsley in 1936.\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, and with the threat of air-raids, the Maudsley Hospital closed and staff dispersed to two locations: a temporary hospital at Mill Hill School in north London and Belmont Hospital in Sutton, Surrey. Staff returned to the Maudsley site in 1945 and three years later the Maudsley joined up with the Bethlem Royal Hospital to become partners in the newly established National Health Service (NHS).\n\nIn the 1960s a group from the Maudsley Hospital attacked the use of lithium for mood disorders. The head, Aubrey Lewis, called it \"dangerous nonsense\", and colleagues published that it was therapeutically ineffective. Their objections have recently been described as 'poorly grounded' and having steered practitioners away from a beneficial agent. In 1999, the Maudsley Hospital became part of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (\"SLaM\"), along with the Bethlem Royal Hospital.\n\nThe trust manages one of the UK's few biomedical research centres specialising in mental health. The centre, managed in partnership with the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, is based on the Maudsley Hospital campus and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).\n\nIn 2013 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (‘SLaM’) took part in a Channel 4 observational documentary entitled \"Bedlam\". The final programme, \"Breakdown\", focused on older adults, including those admitted to the Older Adults Ward at Maudsley Hospital.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2289787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289787", "title": "Marine isotope stage", "text": "Marine isotope stage\n\nMarine isotope stages (MIS), marine oxygen-isotope stages, or oxygen isotope stages (OIS), are alternating warm and cool periods in the Earth's paleoclimate, deduced from oxygen isotope data reflecting changes in temperature derived from data from deep sea core samples. Working backwards from the present, which is MIS 1 in the scale, stages with even numbers have high levels of oxygen-18 and represent cold glacial periods, while the odd-numbered stages are troughs in the oxygen-18 figures, representing warm interglacial intervals. The data are derived from pollen and foraminifera (plankton) remains in drilled marine sediment cores, sapropels, and other data that reflect historic climate; these are called proxies.\n\nThe MIS timescale was developed from the pioneering work of Cesare Emiliani in the 1950s, and is now widely used in archaeology and other fields to express dating in the Quaternary period (the last 2.6 million years), as well as providing the fullest and best data for that period for paleoclimatology or the study of the early climate of the Earth, representing \"the standard to which we correlate other Quaternary climate records\". Emiliani's work in turn depended on Harold Urey's prediction in a paper of 1947 that the ratio between oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 isotopes in calcite, the main chemical component of the shells and other hard parts of a wide range of marine organisms, should vary depending on the prevailing water temperature in which the calcite was formed.\n\nOver 100 stages have been identified, going currently back some 6 million years, and the scale may in future reach back up to 15 mya. Some stages, in particular MIS 5, are divided into sub-stages, such as \"MIS 5a\", with 5 a, c, and e being warm and b and d cold. A numeric system for referring to \"horizons\" (events rather than periods) may also be used, with for example MIS 5.5 representing the peak point of MIS 5e, and 5.51, 5.52 etc. representing the peaks and troughs of the record at a still more detailed level. For more recent periods, increasingly precise resolution of timing continues to be developed.\n\nIn 1957 Emiliani moved to the University of Miami to have access to core-drilling ships and equipment, and began to drill in the Caribbean and collect core data. A further important advance came in 1967, when Nicholas Shackleton suggested that the fluctuations over time in the marine isotope ratios that had become evident by then were caused not so much by changes in water temperature, as Emiliani thought, but mainly by changes in the volume of ice-sheets, which when they expanded took up the lighter oxygen-16 isotope in preference to the heavier oxygen-18. The cycles in the isotope ratio were found to correspond to terrestrial evidence of glacials and interglacials. A graph of the entire series of stages then revealed unsuspected advances and retreats of ice and also filled in the details of the stadials and interstadials.\n\nMore recent ice core samples of today's glacial ice substantiated the cycles through studies of ancient pollen deposition. Currently a number of methods are making additional detail possible. Matching the stages to named periods proceeds as new dates are discovered and new regions are explored geologically. The marine isotopic records appear more complete and detailed than any terrestrial equivalents, and have enabled a timeline of glaciation for the Plio-Pleistocene to be identified. It is now believed that changes in the size of the major ice sheets such as the historical Laurentide Ice Sheet of North America are the main factor governing variations in the oxygen isotope ratios.\n\nThe MIS data also matches the astronomical data of Milankovitch cycles of orbital forcing or the effects of variations in insolation caused by cyclical slight changes in the tilt of the earth's axis of rotation – the \"orbital theory\". Indeed, that the MIS data matched Milankovich's theory, which he formed during World War I, so well was a key factor in the theory gaining general acceptance, despite some remaining problems at certain points, notably the so-called 100,000-year problem. For relatively recent periods data from radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology also support the MIS data. The sediments also acquire depositional remanent magnetization which allows them to be correlated with earth's geomagnetic reversals. For older core samples, individual annual depositions cannot usually be distinguished, and dating is taken from the geomagnetic information in the cores. Other information, especially as to the ratios of gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is provided by analysis of ice cores.\n\nThe SPECMAP Project, funded by the US National Science Foundation, has produced one standard chronology for oxygen isotope records, although there are others. This high resolution chronology was derived from several isotopic records, the composite curve was then smoothed, filtered and tuned to the known cycles of the astronomical variables. The use of a number of isotopic profiles was designed to eliminate 'noise' errors, that could have been contained within a single isotopic record. Another large research project funded by the US government in the 1970s and 1980s was (CLIMAP), which to a large degree succeeded in its aim of producing a map of the global climate at the Last Glacial Maximum, some 18,000 years ago, with some of the research also directed at the climate some 120,000 years ago, during the last interglacial. The theoretical advances and greatly improved data available by the 1970s enabled a \"grand synthesis\" to be made, best known from the 1976 paper \"Variations in the earth’s orbit: pacemaker of the ice ages\" (in \"Science\"), by J.D.

It is located on the confluence of the Río San Diego and the Rio Grande (locally known as the Río Bravo) bordering with the U.S. state of Texas. It had a population of 1,160 inhabitants in the 2010 census, and is, unusually for a Mexican municipal seat, the second-largest locality in the municipality, after the town of San Carlos (which had a population of 3,126).\n\nThe town was founded in 1859. under the name of \"Resurrección\" by captain Manuel Leal, and tejano expatriate families from San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn June 1675 the area was first visited by Lt. Fernando del Bosque, on a reconnaissance expedition up the Rio Grande from the city of Nuestra Sra. de Guadalupe (Monclova). He was accompanied by the Franciscan Friars Juan Larios and Dionisio de San Buenaventura. The troop camped on the edge of the San Diego river, which the Indians called the \"Nueces\", very near the site of the actual town of Jiménez today. They met with two local Indian chiefs, Bacora and Pinanaca whose tribe, numbering 150 people, were on a buffalo hunting expedition. Del Bosque named the camp \"Santa Clara de las Nueces\".\n\nThe area was again visited in 1729 by captain, José de Barroterán, who suggested a site on the San Diego river for a possible Presidio, but no attempt was made at foundation.\n\nIn December 1735, Governor Blas de la Garza Falcón and Joseph de Eca y Múzquiz selected an area on the banks of the San Diego river for a fort, and actually began cutting logs for its construction, but had to stop operations when they were ordered back to San Juan Bautista. In 1737, permission was given to captain Miguel de la Garza Falcón, son of the governor who had died the previous year, to begin the construction of the presidio on the San Diego, arriving in October of that year with 50 soldiers and officers as well as 16 families for the new presidio which was named \"Sacramento\".\nThe place turned out to be a poor choice as the land was difficult to irrigate, and after a brief two years it was moved to Santa Rosa, now Melchor Muzquiz, Coahuila.\n\nIn 1773, a second attempt at another location on the San Diego river was attempted, this time the location was a small spring, tributary to the San Diego named \"Aguaverde\". The Presidio was completed and occupied by troops by late April 1773. This presidio and garrison lasted at this site for eight years, during which time it saw plenty of action against Indian attacks. In 1781 the garrison was relocated to San Fernando de Austria (now Zaragoza, Coah.), where the company still kept the name of Aguaverde, but the presidio was abandoned. It was not occupied again until the late 1840s and early 1850s, where the garrison of San Vicente was transplanted into the old Presidio.\n\nIn December 1859, a group headed by captain Manuel Leal founded villa La Resurreccion, with families from the surrounding towns of Piedras Negras, Guerrero, Nava, Gigedo, as well as a group of families from San Antonio, Texas. The town was founded on lands previously occupied by the Colonia de Agua Verde.\n\nIn February 1861 the village was attacked by a large force of Lipan Apache people. Some casualties were reported, among them was an old veteran of the Texas Independence and Texas Ranger, Damacio Galván. The Lipans carried off some 500 head of cattle, as well as some children from the town.\nThis fierce attack discouraged many of the settlers and the town's population diminished drastically, many of the families from San Antonio returned to Texas.\n\nDuring the mid to late 1860s, more settlers arrived from neighboring towns, and the town prospered. In 1875, the villa was renamed \"Jiménez\" in honor of Mariano Jiménez, a leader during Mexico's Independence movement.\n\nOn September 26, 1906 the first armed rebellion against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, precursor to the Mexican Revolution began in Jiménez, it was led by Juan José Arredondo and Calixto Guerra, members of the \"Partido Liberal Mexicano\" of Ricardo Flores Magon. The movement was short lived as Federal troop reinforcements from Piedras Negras, surprised and dispersed the revolutionaries the next day at Hacienda Victoria.\n\nOn June 24, 1908 another rebellion was attempted this time at Las Vacas (Cd. Acuña), by Benjamín Canales and Calixto Guerra. After a day-long battle and heavy losses on both sides, the federal garrison prevailed and the revolutionaries were forced to retreat across the border into Texas.\n\nJiménez is located at , at an altitude of above sea level.\n\nIn the 2010 census the municipality had a population of 9,935 inhabitants.\n\nThe region of Jiménez has a hot, semi-arid climate. During the summer, the temperature averages (mean) between 79°F (26°C) and 88°F (31°C).\n\nThe highest precipitation is typically recorded in May, June, September, and October, with an average monthly downfall in the range of 300 to 400 mm.\n\nThe region's main resources are agriculture and livestock.\n\nThe municipality of Jiménez has a total of 33 primary schools, and 5 secondary schools.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1872 he exhibited at the Brussels Salon a marble statue, \"Heliotrope\" (Ghent Gallery), and in 1875, at Brussels, \"Beatrix and Domenica\". He was employed by the government to execute caryatides for the ornate facade of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. In 1876 at the Antwerp Salon he had busts of Emmanuel Hiel and W. Wilson, which were afterwards placed in the communal museum at Brussels. Until 1882 he lived in Paris, where he produced the marble statue \"Immortality\" (Brussels Gallery), and \"The Crowning of Art\", a bronze group on the façade of the Palais des Beaux-Arts at Brussels. His monument to the popular heroes, Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck, was unveiled at Bruges in 1887.\n\nAt his death he left unfinished his principal work, the Anspach monument, which was erected at Brussels under the direction of the architect Janlet with the co-operation of various sculptors.

Nicholson also wrote and co-produced the film.\n\nA trio of cowboys, Vern (Cameron Mitchell), Wes (Jack Nicholson) and Otis (Tom Filer), stop to rest for the night at the remote hideout of a gang of outlaws led by Blind Dick (Harry Dean Stanton). In the morning, they find themselves surrounded by a vigilante hanging party and are forced to become fugitives due to a case of mistaken identity.\n\nOtis is killed. So are accomplices of Blind Dick, who is lynched. Vern and Wes take refuge at a farm belonging to Evan (George Mitchell), who lives alone with his wife and daughter, holding them hostage until they can make an escape. After a member of the vigilantes passes by, the two try to take Evan's horses and he shoots at them, wounding Vern before he is killed himself.\n\nWes and Vern ride off together on one horse with the posse in pursuit. Eventually Vern can go no farther but holds off the posse until Wes can safely get away.\n\n\nHellman said that Roger Corman had agreed to put up funds for a Hellman-directed western at a lunch meeting at the old Brown Derby on Vine Street, just south of Hollywood Boulevard, one of a small chain of famous restaurants in Los Angeles (the famous hat-shaped location was on Wilshire Boulevard). By the end of the lunch, Corman had allowed that since Hellman was making one western, he might as well make two – presumably because, in the mind of the budget-conscious Corman, this would allow them to make two films for less than the usual cost.\n\nThe films were made back-to-back, with \"The Shooting\" in production first. Hellman said that the crew and some cast members stayed on location, and, after taking a week's break, they began filming \"Ride in the Whirlwind\". However, other than travel costs, shooting the two films back-to-back did not result in appreciable savings. Hellman stated that both films were made for under US$75,000 each (approximate total of $150,000 for two, provided by Roger Corman). Hellman and Jack Nicholson, who produced, wrote, and acted in \"Ride in the Whirlwind\", and had a smaller role in \"The Shooting\", had agreed that if they went over budget on either film, they would pay the overage out of their own pockets. Thus they were very careful to keep within the budget for each.\n\nThe films were shot in Eastman Color in Utah, in an area that has since been filled in with an artificial lake. Parts of the film were shot in Kanab Canyon, Calvin Johnson Ranch, Paria, and Glen Canyon in Utah. Hellman said that producers would sometimes hire him to find out where he had shot the films, then fire him once they knew. He stated that he was the last to film there because it was filled with water soon after. Both \"Ride in the Whirlwind\" and \"The Shooting\" feature the same reddish low mountains with white lines in the rock (possibly water marks from a past age when the area was a sea or lake).\n\nHellman said that he tended to cut out as much dialogue as he could. He preferred to tell the story visually. He avoided the obvious in terms of dialogue. Hellman stated that he oversaw the daily progress by the writers of the two films – and that they rented an office in the Writer's Building in Beverly Hills on little Santa Monica Blvd. One personal thrill for Hellman was that their rented office was next door to Fred Astaire's.\n\nHellman stated that both films were sold to a distributor who then sold them as part of a larger package of films to be shown on television. The films did play theatrically in France in 1969 and Hellman said they were hits, with \"The Shooting\" playing for a year in Paris and \"Ride in the Whirlwind\" playing for six months. Hellman stated that in the late sixties it meant a lot in Hollywood to be lionized in France and thus Hellman had a brief time of being very much in demand in Hollywood.\n\nBoth films involve a hunt. In the case of \"The Shooting\", Nicholson is a hired gun and Warren Oates is a bounty hunter. Both men are working for a woman who is tracking someone. The entire film and the suspense is largely based on this mysterious hunt. In \"Ride in the Whirlwind\", a posse that began by tracking a gang who robbed a stagecoach end up hunting down the Nicholson character and another man. Both films are considered acid westerns that express a rather bleak, minimalist quality that does not sentimentalize the Wild West. On the other hand, the violence is portrayed less graphically than, say, in the films of Sam Peckinpah like \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\".\n\n\n"}

It consists of 28 episodes which originally aired in 1969 and 1970. It stars Peter Wyngarde as author Jason King (later featured in spin-off series \"Jason King\"), Joel Fabiani as Stewart Sullivan, and Rosemary Nicols as computer expert Annabelle Hurst. These three are agents for a fictional special department (the \"S\" of the title) of Interpol. The head of Department S is Sir Curtis Seretse (Dennis Alaba Peters).\n\n\"When a case proves too baffling for the minds of Interpol, they turn to the talents of Department S.\" – from the ITC trailer for the series.\n\nThe series was created by Dennis Spooner and Monty Berman, although neither wrote any of the episodes, which were instead scripted by ITC regulars such as Terry Nation and Philip Broadley. Many of the directors on the show had also worked on other ITC shows such as \"The Saint\", \"Danger Man\" and \"Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)\".\n\nThe series was shot on 35mm film and designed, like all ITC's film productions, to fit the United States commercial format. Although episodes begin with a cold open (after the 'S' logo is shown), unusually, the episode title, writer and director credits appear on screen before the opening title sequence, though after the theme tune has started. With a few exceptions, the principal cast is always studio-bound. Some exteriors are represented by studio buildings, while the rest are mainly shown in second-unit footage using doubles where necessary. Outside locations were, in common with similar series, largely restricted to the Hertfordshire countryside in the vicinity of Borehamwood. At least one foreign location was used, featuring Peter Wyngarde on the streets of Vienna. Otherwise, foreign locations are usually established by the use of stock footage. To further cut costs, the series was produced back-to-back with \"Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)\".\n\nDepartment S is a division of Interpol headed by international bureaucrat Sir Curtis Seretse (Dennis Alaba Peters). Its headquarters is in Paris (Interpol's headquarters has been located in Lyon since 1989) and its members investigate international cases that other crime agencies cannot solve.\n\nThe team itself is led by American and former FBI agent Stewart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani), who takes direction from Seretse. Outside of his FBI experience, little is known about Sullivan except that he is pragmatic and hands-on, and does much of the leg-work, confronting the criminals.\n\nJason King (Peter Wyngarde) is the ideas man, but also helps in the field. He is an adventure novelist who uses details from their cases to write his novels. The living he makes writing novels affords him a hedonistic lifestyle, and he is often seen with beautiful women though he has no permanent love interest in the series; in one episode he mentions he is a widower whose wife was killed in a plane crash. King also serves as comic relief in the series, especially in scenes of hand-to-hand combat where he winds up being subdued as often as he prevails.\n\nAnnabelle Hurst (Rosemary Nicols) is a computer expert and analyst as well as a field investigator. A very attractive woman, Hurst sometimes appears in seductive, glamorous disguises. There are ongoing hints of romantic interest between Sullivan and Hurst during the series.\n\nA repeat run of \"Department S\" began on ITV4 in November 2005, alongside others of a large number of similar ITC productions.\n\nThe first two episodes of \"Department S\" were released on a now-deleted DVD in Britain by Carlton Television (now part of ITV plc). \"Department S\" was released on DVD in Australia by Umbrella Entertainment in a box set. This version is in PAL with no region code. Network released the series on DVD in the United Kingdom featuring many exclusive extras, including commentaries and part of a documentary series also covering Jason King: \"Wanna Watch a Television Series? Chapter One: Variations on a Theme\".\n\n\"Department S\" first appeared in high definition on Blu-Ray as a single episode on Retro Action Volume 1 released by the Network imprint on 19 September 2011. This contained the episode \"A Small War of Nerves\", which features Anthony Hopkins.\n\nVolume-by-volume release of the entire series in new high-definition transfers on Blu-Ray began in 2017, with the first available on 27 February. There are six volumes in total; the first two each contain four episodes, the next four contain five episodes each.\n\nA complete box set of the entire series was released on 2 October 2017. Regions are A, B & C: https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Department-S-The-Complete-Series-Blu-ray/186594/\n\n\nFilming took place between April 1968 and June 1969.\n\nThe airdates are for ATV Midlands.

He graduated from the Verdi Conservatory in Milan in 1928, having studied composition and conducting as well as honing his skills at the piano. In Italy he performed a broad range of music, from pop to jazz and classical, and in 1938 led his first radio orchestra in Italy. In the late 1950s he also featured regularly at the San Remo Festival.\n\nBack in the UK, he hosted a light music programme, \"Semprini Serenade\", which he introduced with the words: \"Old ones, new ones, loved ones, neglected ones\". The program first aired on BBC Radio in 1957 and continued for around 25 years. Although his 'house band' was the New Abbey Light Symphony Orchestra on his commercial records, on radio he was always accompanied by one of the BBC's own staff orchestras – initially the BBC Revue Orchestra.\n\nSemprini also wrote a number of original light music compositions, including \"Concerto Appassionato\" and \"Mediterranean Concerto\", which he used as the theme tune for his radio show.\n\nSemprini was a prolific recording artist. His work was first released on the Italian label Fonit Cetra, then EMI Records, where he remained for the rest of his professional career. Although strongly associated with light music, his recordings were principally of well-known classical music, including the Grieg Piano Concerto and solo pieces by Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Tchaikovsky and Debussy.\n\nIn 2015 Vocalion Records released a CD of his late 1950s broadcasts with the BBC Revue Orchestra, most of which had not been heard since their first broadcast.\n\nIn the \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" segment known as \"The Chemist Sketch\", the BBC interrupted the show to ban a number of \"naughty\" words, including \"b*m\", \"b*tty\", \"kn*ckers\", \"p*x\" and \"w**-w**\". The final prohibited word, a puzzling and random addition to the list, was \"Semprini\". Immediately when the action resumed, the chemist (John Cleese) asked, \"Who's got a boil on his Semprini, then?\" and was quickly taken away by a policeman (Graham Chapman). For the rest of the episode, anyone saying \"Semprini\" was similarly arrested.\n"}

It wasn't until the next day I realized she was a girl.\"\n\"I told her, `Oh, sweetheart, I can't let you box. You're a girl. \nI can't let you box with the boys.' But she said she wanted to try and box them.\"\nShe lasted four rounds that first day, and made an impression on Pena, who had never trained a female before. \"I told her, `If you want to box, show up at 3:30 and don't be late. Every day since, she's showed up at 3:30.\" Pena later became Cooper's legal guardian.\n\nCooper went on to compile a depth of ring experience as an amateur boxer, quite rare for a female fighter, racking up an amateur record of 37-2, and numerous national amateur championships.\n\nWhen she turned pro, she made history by becoming the first female boxer under the age of 18 to be licensed in the state of Nevada. The move was seen as necessary, because it was becoming increasingly difficult to find amateurs willing to fight Cooper. \nPena said he would try to enter Cooper in tournaments at the last minute to keep her a secret, because \"girls would find out that Melinda was in a tournament's weight class and everyone would drop out.\" \n\nCooper began her professional boxing career at age 17 on March 23, 2002 in Las Vegas, Nevada, winning a four round unanimous decision over Annalisa Middleton.\n\nOn July 2004, Cooper won a 6-round unanimous decision to Johanna Peña-Álvarez.\n\nCooper has beaten every opponent she has faced as a professional, and on January 14, 2005 in Rancho Mirage, California, she TKO'd Anissa Zamarron in the ninth round to win the vacant IBA and WIBA Flyweight World Titles. \n\nCurrently, Cooper has a professional record of 20-0 with 11 KOs.\n\nIn addition to her impressive boxing resume, Cooper has also been featured in several nationally recognized magazines including Girls Life, Teen and World Boxing. \nHer personality and striking good looks are leading to experiences and endorsement opportunities beyond the sport she does so well. \n\n\"What makes Melinda appealing both inside and outside the ring is that she's real\", says James Pena. \"There is nothing fake about her; there are no masks. What you see is what you get. Melinda has the least amount of ego of anyone I know.\" \n\"Don't get me wrong, she does have pride and that's what she protects when she gets in the ring. But as far as her perception of herself and how she treats everyone around her, that's her best asset and it doesn't have anything to do with boxing.\"\n"}

His real surname was Asimopoulos (Ασημόπουλος). Asimos was a very special case of a counter-culture artist, mostly because of his lifestyle. His behaviour and songs were often received as provocative by the general public. He was a person with strong political opinions. Ideologically, he could be categorised as an anarchist but he never accepted being put in a specific political ideology.\n\nNikolas Asimos was born in Thessaloniki. Both his parents were from Kozani. As a young man he was eager to learn new things. In 1967 he enrolled in the Philosophical School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. During his college years he was often involved with theatre and the performing arts whilst writing songs and singing in various boîtes of Thessaloniki.\n\nHe often had problems with the police, particularly during the period of military rule — junta — in Greece and the consequent restriction on civil liberties, i.e., freedom of expression.\n\nIn 1973, he moved to Athens from Thessaloniki; there he continued to be involved in theatre studies and graduated from a private theatre school. He wrote songs which were not recorded officially, but rather privately and on tapes that he would then sell on the streets of Athens. He performed in boîtes around Plaka along with Yannis Zouganelis and Sakis Boulas, among others. His first official recording effort was in 1974 with the single \"Romios – Michanismos\" (Ρωμιός – Μηχανισμός). In 1976, he had a daughter with Lillian Charitaki with whom he was not married.\n\nIn 1977, he was temporarily imprisoned along with five other editors and writers. They were all released after an initiative by Dionysis Savvopoulos. In 1978 he was drafted into the Greek army but did not serve as he was relieved of duty for psychological reasons. He wrote a book titled \"Anazitontas Krokantropous\" (Αναζητώντας Κροκανθρώπους \"Looking for Yolk-men\") which was never officially published, but was circulated by him in photocopies. In his later years and after his death, the book was also made available by a publishing house. In 1982, he released his long play record titled \"O Ksanapes\" (Ο Ξαναπές), \"The Say-It-Again Man\".\n\nIn 1987, he was accused of raping an ex-girlfriend and was forcibly placed in a mental institution. Shortly after he was sent to Korydallos Prison and was later bailed out. He never managed to overcome his bitterness over this charge. The outstanding trial along with other personal problems affected his psychological state profoundly. After two failed attempts, he committed suicide by hanging on 17 March 1988 in his house which he used to call \"preparation area\". It is rumoured that he kept a diary during the last 15 days of his life in which he describes his efforts to find something worth living for in his life. He marked the pages with an \"X\" which meant that he had not found anything worth living for. The 15th day was also marked with an \"X\" which is the day he hanged himself.\n\nHis \"Paranomes Kassetes\" (illegal tapes), as Asimos liked to call his early work due to its lyrical content, were recorded in friends' houses and other more or less inappropriate (concerning a recording session) locations, with several musicians accompanying him. The tapes had an underground distribution by Asimos himself or his friends, because he wanted to avoid his work being exploited by Record Labels. Apart from the tapes, he produced during his lifetime a 45rpm single with two songs and a full-length LP, as well as five compositions for a Vasilis Papakonstantinou record. The rest of his work was released after he died.\n\n\n\n\n"}

When Gifford was a teen, the Dutch painter Albertus Van Beest arrived in New Bedford, and the two collaborated on ship paintings.\n\nGifford opened a studio in Boston in 1864. Two years later he moved to New York City. In 1867 he was named an Associate of the National Academy of Design and in 1878 he became a full member. He travelled and painted in Oregon and California, then left for Europe, where he visited Great Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Before returning to the U.S. he travelled to Morocco and Egypt. He was joined by fellow artists such as Louis Comfort Tiffany, and painted some subjects from those regions. \nMuch of his work focuses on the landscapes of New England. He, along with Victorian contemporaries from the White Mountain and Hudson River Schools, helped immortalize the majestic cliffs of Grand Manan in the Bay of Fundy. His painting from the island, \"Pettes Cove\", is illustrative of his masterful marine work.

The 14th Parliament of the Italian republic was chosen.\n\nThe election was won by the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi, defeating Francesco Rutelli, former Mayor of Rome, and Prime Ministerial candidate of the centre-left coalition The Olive Tree, and rising back to power after Berlusconi's first victory, in the 1994 general election.\n\nThe intricate electoral system, called scorporo, provided 75% of the seats on the Chamber of Deputies (the Lower House) as elected by first-past-the-post system, whereas the remaining 25% was assigned on a proportional way with a minimum threshold of 4%.\nThe method used for the Senate was even more complicated: 75% of seats by uninominal method, and 25% by a special proportional method that assigned the remaining seats to minority parties. Formally, these were examples of additional member systems.\n\nFor this election Berlusconi again ran as leader of the centre-right coalition the House of Freedoms (), which included the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, the Northern League, the National Alliance and other parties.\n\nOn the television interviews programme \"Porta a Porta\", during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a so-called \"Contratto con gli Italiani\" (), an idea copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from the Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election, which was widely considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 campaign bid for prime ministership. In this solemn agreement, Berlusconi claimed his commitment on improving several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed); secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate; thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros; and fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities. Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.\n\nIn 2001 the proportional list exhausted before all the deputies - which the winning party was entitled to - were declared elected.\n\n"}

The other limit of eye's accommodation is the near point.\n\nFor an unaccommodated emmetropic eye, the far point is at infinity, but for the sake of practicality, infinity is considered to be 6 m because the accommodation change from 6 m to infinity is negligible. See visual acuity or snellen chart for details about 6/6 (m) or 20/20 (ft) vision.\n\nFor an unaccommodated myopic eye, the far point is closer than 6 m.

{"id": "2289891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289891", "title": "Merengue típico", "text": "Merengue típico\n\nMerengue típico (also known as merengue cibaeño or colloquially as Perico ripiao) is a musical genre of the Dominican Republic, and the oldest style of merengue. Merengue típico is the term preferred by most musicians as it is more respectful and emphasizes the music's traditional nature. The Instruments that are used are the accordion, bass guitar, güira, conga, and tambora (drum)\n\n\"Merengue típico\" is the oldest style of merengue still performed today (usually in the Dominican Republic and the United States), its origins dating back to the 1850s. It originated in the rural city of Navarrete (villa bisono), northern valley region around the city of Santiago called the Cibao, resulting in the term \"merengue cibaeño\". Originally played on the metal scraper called güira, the Tambora, and a stringed instrument (usually a guitar or a variant such as the tres). Stringed instruments were replaced with two-row diatonic button accordions when Germans began to travel to the island in the 1880s as part of the tobacco trade. Later, the \"marimbula\", a bass lamellophone related to the African \"mbira\", was added to fill out the sound. \"Merengue tipico\" is very popular not only in the Dominican Republic but has migrated to the United States and many other countries. \n\nMerengue first appears in the Caribbean in the 1850s. The earliest documented evidence of merengue in the Dominican Republic are newspaper articles complaining about this \"lascivious\" dance displacement of the earlier \"tumba.\"\n\nEarly merengue was played on stringed instruments, but the accordion came to the island in the 1880s, introduced by German traders, and quickly became the primary instrument in merengue.\n\nUp until the 1930s, the music was considered immoral. Its more descriptive and colorful name, \"perico ripiao\" (literally \"ripped parrot\" in Spanish) is said to have been the name of a bordello in Santiago where the music was played. Moralists tried to ban the music and the provocative dance that accompanied it, but with little success. Dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo brought accordionists with him on the campaign trail, and once he took power, he ensured that merengue was embraced as a national music by all classes of Dominicans.\n\nThe city of Navarrete is the exact origin of merengue tipico; the musician Nicol Lora, a native of the town, introduced it. Official versions promote the three-cultures origin, using the European accordion together with the African tambora and Taino guira.\n\nAfter Trujillo's assassination, Dominican society changed rapidly as processes of urbanization and migration accelerated. Merengue tipico changed too. Through the efforts of artists like El Cieguito de Nagua, and particularly Tatico Henriquez, the music became faster and more technically demanding, while incorporating new instruments. They replaced marimba with electric bass, and added saxophone and congas.\n\nThe popularity of merengue overseas in New York during the 1980s caused a shift in the production of the genre in the Dominican Republic. The lyrics utilized less slang and language specific to Dominican dialects of Spanish to be understood by non-Dominican listeners. A shift to a faster rhythm for merengue performers also occurred, sparking a debate amongst Dominicans on whether the changes occurring should be considered merengue or another genre. Many feared too much international influence would change the style for the worse, losing the roots that made merengue popular to begin with. \n\nIn the 1990s a new generation of musicians added a bass drum, played with a foot pedal by the guirero, and timbales, played by the tamborero for fills (timbales in merengue tipico were believed to have been first incorporated by Ray \"Chino\" Diaz, a famous Dominican percussionist and tambora player). Agapito Pascual is credited with creating the new style termed \"merengue con mambo\" in 1987 with his recording, \"La Vieja y su Pipa.\" Merengue con mambo refers to a merengue with a second section based on hard driving rhythms and riffs played by the accordion and saxophone together. This is the dominant style today that has been further explored by artists like Ricardo Gutierrez () El Prodigio, Geovanny Polanco, Raul Roman (son of accordion legend Rafaelito Roman), and Kerubanda. Artists like Krisspy and Aguakate have pushed genre boundaries even further with more mambo and fusions with other rhythms like reggaeton, and many artists like Fulanito have fused merengue-style accordion playing with rap music. A new crop of merengue musicians, notably Limi-T 21, have attempted to create an orchestra merengue and perico ripiao fusion on songs like \"Que Lo Bailen\". The bpm of the music has also transformed, originally between 130 and 140 [tempo], but today is sometimes sped up from 160 to 190 tempo.\n\nToday merengue tipico actually consists of several different rhythms. Merengue derecho, or straight-ahead merengue, is the kind of fast-paced, march-like merengue Americans are most used to hearing. Pambiche or merengue apambichao is said to have developed during the American occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–1924), taking its name from the \"Palm Beach\" fabric worn by American soldiers. Its tempo is usually slower than merengue derecho, and it can be recognized by the more syncopated rhythms in both bass and tambora. It is probably the rhythm most beloved by típico aficionados: dancing to it is said to require more skill since it is more complicated and syncopated than merengue derecho, and it helps to set the típico genre apart since it is used infrequently by orquesta groups. Guinchao is a third and more recently developed rhythm that is a combination of the other two. The once-common paseo, a slow introduction during which couples would promenade around the dance floor, is now common only in folkloric presentations. In the past, other dances like the mangulina, carabiné, polka, guarapo, and zarambo were also played on accordion, but are now generally heard only at folkloric presentations.\n\nIn merengue, various slang is used to signify instruments, quality, the act of playing, etc. Below are a list of terms.\n\n\nSmithsonian Folkways CD with liner notes by Sydney Hutchinson (much of the text in this entry is copied from here)\n"}

The Sevillian cofradías had the tutelage of a Catholic saint and were held in the saint’s chapel.\n\n\"One of the earliest known \"Cabildos de nación\" in Cuba was Mandinga Zape (1568)\" The first cabildo on Compostela street in Havana was built in a lot purchased in 1691 by the Arará family. The same lot is still known as \"el solar de los Arará\" (the Arará’s lot). At the time the African population in Cuba was not as significant as it was after the 19th century with the sugar boom. Cabildos were organized by slaves belonging to the same ethnic group and became very popular in the urban areas.\n\nSpanish legislation supported the cabildos as means of entertainment for the slave population, and as social control alleviating the tensions between the masters and the slaves. Slaves were allowed to gather on holidays so that they could dance according to the customs of their African nations...\n\nFor the slaves, the cabildo had many uses. They were able to collect money or pool resources to assist members in times of illness or death. Cabildos also had a religious purpose, they were the place where slaves could consult their deities and ancestors. For those slaves who clung to the religious traditions of Africa, a \"cabildo\" was one of the few means of succor at their disposal. The cabildo represented Africa in foreign territory that would help slaves keep alive their faith. \"Cabildos\" were institutions that made possible the conservation of the idiosyncrasy, religion and culture of the African nations in Cuba. The songs, dances, and drum rhythms that were played for African deities in a land that was so hostile to the Africans slaves were the mechanism by which slaves were able to keep alive their Africanness and resist Spanish cultural hegemony.\n\nWhite Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a necessary evil. By the 18th century, these spaces of cultural autonomy and support began to worry slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as they sang and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside the walls of the city of Havana so that whites would not have to see or hear their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.\n\nBy the early 19th century cabildos were practically extinct after failed rebellions by the African slaves. There was a revival in their number in the mid-19th century, when they were no longer limited to slaves but welcomed free Afro-Cubans of all walks of life. In 1884, the Cuban government outlawed the Epiphany, a celebration cabildos practiced for more than a century on the 6th of January, which included parading as comparsas down the streets of Havana. In 1887, new laws required cabildos to obtain prior official recognition and licenses. Since slavery had by then been abolished, the authorities sought new means of controlling the free Afro-Cuban population. In 1888 the government forced cabildos to organize as mutual-aid societies following the established laws for white Cuban societies.\n\nSlaves were differentiated by their white owners according to their place of origin, with a variety of different names that identified distinct ethnicities from Africa. The names were corruptions of traditional tribal names devised by the slave owners, but they were soon used by the slaves themselves.\n\n\n"}

She records and performs with the bands Stars and Broken Social Scene as well as having a successful solo career. Her second solo album, \"Masters of the Burial\", was released by Arts & Crafts Productions in September 2009.\n\nAmy Millan grew up in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood of Toronto. She attended high school at Jarvis Collegiate Institute, and later the Etobicoke School of the Arts where she studied drama alongside future Broken Social Scene bandmates Kevin Drew and Emily Haines. Millan and Haines formed the band Edith's Mission. Although short-lived, Edith's Mission did play a sold-out show at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. After high school, Millan moved to Montreal for three years to attend Concordia University and gained experience as a solo performer by playing in coffee shops. Upon returning to Toronto, she formed the roots-rock band 16 Tons and wrote many of the songs that she would use to launch her solo career several years later. After the breakup of 16 Tons, Millan moved to Los Angeles. While living there, her song with 16 Tons, \"Bury Me,\" was added to the soundtrack of the film \"Drowning Mona\". However, Millan, missing a city where walking was encouraged over driving, returned to Toronto.\n\nStars was formed by Torquil Campbell and Chris Seligman in New York City. The line-up subsequently grew to incorporate Evan Cranley, with whom Millan had played gigs while a member of 16 Tons. Feeling that Millan would be a good fit for the group, Cranley invited her to New York City to audition in December 1999. After receiving assurances that she would be actively involved in the songwriting process, Millan agreed to join the band. As much of their debut album had been recorded prior to her joining, Millan's involvement in 2001's \"Nightsongs\" was limited, although she did sing lead vocals on \"Toxic Holiday\". Desiring to return to Canada, but not wanting to move to Toronto, the band relocated to Montreal. Drummer Pat McGee was recruited as their fifth member prior to the release of their second album, \"Heart\", in 2003. Millan's influence was more evident on this album, and a number of the tracks were performed as duets between her and Torquil Campbell, establishing a style for which the band would become well known. Stars' commercial breakthrough came with their 2004 album \"Set Yourself on Fire\" and the accompanying single \"Ageless Beauty\", which featured a lead vocal by Millan. Their fourth album, \"In Our Bedroom After the War\", was released in 2007 and was followed by the EP \"Sad Robots\" the following year. In June 2010, they released their fifth full-length album, \"The Five Ghosts\".\n\nAlthough she did not officially contribute to Broken Social Scene's first two albums, due to scheduling conflicts for BSS members Emily Haines and Leslie Feist, she was asked by former classmate Kevin Drew to \"be the girl\" and sing with the band for the release concert of the band's second album, \"You Forgot It in People\". From 2002 onward, Millan has often performed in BSS alongside fellow Stars members Evan Cranley, Chris Seligman and Torquil Campbell. She appeared on their 2005 self-titled album and also contributed vocals and writing to Kevin Drew's 2007 solo album \"Spirit If...\" as well as to Brendan Canning's 2008 solo album \"Something For All of Us\". As in Stars, Amy usually sings with BSS but also plays guitar and percussion during live shows.\n\nAmy Millan released her debut solo album, \"Honey from the Tombs\", in 2006. It consisted of songs largely written before 2000, from when Millan was a member of 16 Tons. The album title was inspired by a Tom Waits interview where he compared the release of older songs to the discovery of sweet honey buried in Egyptian tombs. The album was produced by Ian Blurton and musical contributors included Brendan Canning and Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene and Dan and Jenny Whiteley from Crazy Strings.\n\nIn contrast to her work with Stars, Millan's solo work is strongly influenced by country and folk music. Thematically, many of the songs deal with loss and loneliness, and taking solace in alcohol is sung about numerous times. Millan's upbringing in Toronto provided the inspiration for the song \"Wayward and Parliament\", which is based on her time working in the coffee shop \"Jet Fuel\" on Parliament Street.\n\nTwo videos were shot to promote \"Honey from the Tombs\": \"Skinny Boy\" was directed by George Vale, and \"Baby I\" was directed by Anthony Seck. The songs \"Losin' You\" and \"Baby I\", were released as 7\" singles in Europe. Millan also toured extensively to support the album, playing dates in North America, Japan and Europe.\n\nMillan released her second album, \"Masters of the Burial\", on September 8, 2009. The album is produced by Martin Kinack and musicians appearing include Evan Cranley, Dan and Jenny Whiteley, Leslie Feist and Liam O'Neil. The album features several cover songs, including some written by Death Cab for Cutie and Sarah Harmer.\n\nMillan is married to Stars bandmate Evan Cranley. Their daughter, Delphine Rita Jane Cranley, was born on March 21, 2011. Millan gave birth to a son in 2017.\n\nFor Amy Millan's work with Stars, see Stars discography.\n\n"}

The game features character designs by manga artist Tetsuo Hara, famous for \"Fist of the North Star\".\n\nThe game was followed by an updated version titled \"Muscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle\" in 1993, and a sequel called \"Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters II\" in 1994.\n\nThe original \"Slam Masters\" plays like a traditional wrestling game, only the game used a view similar to that commonly used in the fighting game genre. The game uses a three button configuration (grab, attack, and jump).\n\nEach character has two special attacks: a non-grappling technique and a finisher. When an opponent's life meter is depleted, he must either be pinned for a three-count or forced to submit. Defeating all of the other wrestlers results in winning the championship belt, which must then be defended against the entire roster.\n\nThere are two game modes: Single Match, where the player fights in a series one-on-one matches against the CPU; and Team Battle Royale, where the player and another partner (controlled by another player or by the CPU) competes in a series of two-on-two matches. The game can be played by up to four players.\n\nThe game features a playable roster of ten wrestlers. Only eight of the wrestlers are selectable in the Single Match mode. The remaining two: Jumbo and Scorpion, are non-playable boss characters in Single Match and selectable only in Team Battle Royale. In the English localization, Capcom changed the names of all the characters and modified much of the backstory. The English names are used in this article, followed by the original Japanese names (when they differ) in parentheses.\n\nThe table below summarizes the appearances of every character in the \"Slam Masters\" series. A green cell means the character is present in that series. A red cell means the character is absent from that series. A yellow cell means the character is present in the series, but cannot be played as. (i.e.: NPC Bosses or ending cameos)\nThe original \"Slam Masters\" was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis and FM Towns Marty. The Super NES version retains the Team Battle Royale mode (which can be played with the multitap for up to four players), while the Genesis version replaces it with an exclusive Death Match mode. The Genesis version is also the only version of the game that allows the player to select The Scorpion and Jumbo for the Single Battle mode. In contrast to the arcade version, which only used Tetsuo Hara's artwork for promotional illustrations, the console versions of \"Slam Masters\" for the Super NES and Genesis use Haras actual artwork in the game.\n\nReviewing the Super NES version, \"GamePro\" praised the four-player gameplay, the variety of moves, and the unique graphical touches to each of the characters. They concluded \"If you want a breather from intense fighting games, this wrestling cart's a refreshing break.\"\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" panned the Genesis version, saying that the game is generic and unoriginal, and that only the barbed-wire ring in the Death Match \"[saves] the game from being horrible.\" He urged wrestling fans to get \"WWF Raw\" instead.\n\nMuscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle, released in Japan as Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors, is an updated version of the original \"Slam Masters\" which eliminates the Single Match mode from the original game, focusing solely on the two-on-two Team Battle mode. The same character can now be chosen by more than one player and each wrestler now has two additional special moves: a dual side attack and a vacuum move. \"Duo\" is the only game in the series to retain the \"Muscle Bomber\" title for its international releases.\n\nAlthough the players can choose and pick their team as they please, there are five \"official\" combinations that the game will recognize and give a name to. The official tag teams are as follows:\n\nRing of Destruction: Slam Masters II, released in Japan as Super Muscle Bomber: The International Blowout, is the proper sequel to \"Slam Masters\", now a CP System II game. Unlike the original, this game was never ported.\n\nThe game's format was changed to play more like a traditional one-on-one 2D fighting game with the action restricted to one plane (similar to \"Street Fighter II\"), albeit with an emphasis on grappling. Controls were upgraded to five buttons: two punch buttons, two kick buttons, and a grapple button. The objective of each match is to deplete the opponent's life bar in two out of three rounds. It is no longer possible for the player to pin their opponent to win a match, though all other wrestling-style moves have been retained.\n\nAll ten characters from the original \"Slam Masters\" returned, along with four new selectable characters:\n\nIn the \"Street Fighter\" animated series episode \"New Kind of Evil\", Mike Haggar appears in a fight against Blanka, and the human forms of the three guys who become monsters resemble that of Gunloc, The Great Oni, and Titanic Tim. It is also mentioned in the 1994 arcade game \"Street Fighter: The Movie\" that the \"Blade\" character is actually a deep cover agent named Gunloc in disguise as one of Bison's Shock Troops, and is shown to be Guile's brother (playing into the well-known rumor that the two are related). This is not canon for either game series, as the Japanese version of Slam Masters does not have him related to Guile in any way, shape, or form, and this connection made between the two is probably nothing more than a reference to a popular video game rumor.\n\n"}

Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, she moved to New York City in 1959. She was director of Women's Studies and Professor of Performing and Creative Arts at the College of Staten Island, CUNY. She is highly regarded by critics and admirers, but her novels are less familiar to the broader public.\n\nShe is best known for her stylistically bold novel \"Lover\", published in 1976. She published two other novels, \"Catching Saradove\" (1969), and \"Confessions of Cherubino\" (1972). \"Lover\" was brought out by the Vermont based independent publisher Daughters, Inc., a small publisher of women's fiction. In all three novels, Harris engaged the aesthetics of late twentieth-century literature; they may be considered examples of literary postmodernism. Her novels are stylistically akin to the work of modernist writers such as Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, and Djuna Barnes (whom she greatly admired), and she has acknowledged as inspiration the work of Jill Johnston and the dancer Yvonne Rainer. She once proclaimed that Djuna Barnes's work was \"practically the only available expression of lesbian culture we have in the modern western world\" since Sappho.\n\nMuch of Harris's work, most notably \"Lover\", is written with the women's movement of the 1970s as its primary inspiration and its audience. Indeed, \"Lover\" might be viewed as a literary mother of queer theory; her novel resonates almost as strongly with third-wave feminism as it does with the second-wave feminism of its origins.\n\nHarris co-authored \"The Joy of Lesbian Sex\" in 1977 with Emily L. Sisley, and in 1995 she published \"Gertrude Stein\", a biography for young adults. \"Lover\" was reissued in 1993 by the New York University Press with a new introduction by the author, mainly recounting her involvement with Daughters Press and its two owners.\n\nAt the time of her death she was completing her fourth novel, a comedy, \"Mi Contra Fa\".\n\nShe died in New York City.\n\n"}
{"id": "2289941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289941", "title": "Terror management theory", "text": "Terror management theory\n\nTerror management theory (TMT) is both a social and evolutionary psychology theory originally proposed by Jeff Greenberg, Sheldon Solomon, and Tom Pyszczynski and codified in their book \"The Worm at the Core: On the Role of Death in Life\" (2015). It proposes that a basic psychological conflict results from having a self-preservation instinct while realizing that death is inevitable and to some extent unpredictable. This conflict produces terror, and the terror is then managed by embracing cultural beliefs, or symbolic systems that act to counter biological reality with more durable forms of meaning and value.\n\nThe most obvious examples of cultural values that assuage death anxiety are those that purport to offer literal immortality (e.g. belief in afterlife, religion). However, TMT also argues that other cultural values – including those that are seemingly unrelated to death – offer symbolic immortality. For example, values of national identity, posterity, cultural perspectives on sex, and human superiority over animals have been linked to death concerns. In many cases these values are thought to offer symbolic immortality either a) by providing the sense that one is part of something greater that will ultimately outlive the individual (e.g. country, lineage, species), or b) by making one's symbolic identity superior to biological nature (i.e. you are a personality, which makes you more than a glob of cells).\n\nBecause cultural values determine that which is meaningful, they are also the foundation for self-esteem. TMT describes self-esteem as being the personal, subjective measure of how well an individual is living up to their cultural values.\n\nTMT is derived from anthropologist Ernest Becker's 1973 Pulitzer Prize-winning work of nonfiction \"The Denial of Death\", in which Becker argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. The terror of absolute annihilation creates such a profound – albeit subconscious – anxiety in people that they spend their lives attempting to make sense of it. On large scales, societies build symbols: laws, religious meaning systems, cultures, and belief systems to explain the significance of life, define what makes certain characteristics, skills, and talents extraordinary, reward others whom they find exemplify certain attributes, and punish or kill others who do not adhere to their cultural worldview. On an individual level, self-esteem provides a buffer against death-related anxiety.\n\nCultural anthropologist Ernest Becker asserted in his 1973 book \"The Denial of Death\" that humans, as intelligent animals, are able to grasp the inevitability of death. They therefore spend their lives building and believing in cultural elements that illustrate how to make themselves stand out as individuals and give their lives significance and meaning. Death creates an anxiety in humans; it strikes at unexpected and random moments, and its nature is essentially unknowable, causing people to spend most of their time and energy to explain, forestall, and avoid it.\n\nBecker expounded upon the previous writings of Sigmund Freud, Søren Kierkegaard, Norman O. Brown, and Otto Rank. According to clinical psychiatrist Morton Levitt, Becker replaces the Freudian preoccupation with sexuality with the fear of death as the primary motivation in human behavior.\n\nPeople desire to think of themselves as beings of value and worth with a feeling of permanence, a concept in psychology known as self-esteem. This feeling counters the cognitive dissonance created by an individual's realization that they may be no more important than any other living thing. Becker refers to high self-esteem as heroism: \n\nThe rationale behind decisions regarding one's own health can be explored through a terror management model. A 2008 research article in Psychological Review proposes a three-part model for understanding how awareness of death can ironically subvert health-promoting behaviors by redirecting one's focus towards behaviors that build self-esteem instead: \"\"Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities.\"\"\n\nTerror management theorists consider TMT to be compatible with the theory of evolution: Valid fears of dangerous things have an adaptive function that helped facilitate the survival of our ancestors' genes. However, generalized existential anxiety resulting from the clash between a desire for life and awareness of the inevitability of death is neither adaptive nor selected for. TMT views existential anxiety as an unfortunate byproduct of these two highly adaptive human proclivities rather than as an adaptation that the evolutionary process selected for its advantages. Just as human bipedalism confers advantages as well as disadvantages, death anxiety is an inevitable part of our intelligence and awareness of dangers.\n\nAnxiety in response to the inevitability of death threatened to undermine adaptive functioning and therefore needed amelioration. TMT posits that humankind used the same intellectual capacities that gave rise to this problem to fashion cultural beliefs and values that provided protection against this potential anxiety. TMT considers these cultural beliefs (even unpleasant and frightening ones, such as ritual human sacrifice) when they manage potential death anxiety in a way that promotes beliefs and behaviors which facilitated the functioning and survival of the collective.\n\nHunter-gatherers used their emerging cognitive abilities to facilitate solving practical problems, such as basic needs for nutrition, mating, and tool-making. As these abilities evolved, an explicit awareness of death also emerged. But once this awareness materialized, the potential for terror that it created put pressure on emerging conceptions of reality. Any conceptual formation that was to be widely accepted by the group needed to provide a means of managing this terror.\n\nOriginally, the emergence of morality evolved to facilitate co-existence within groups. Together with language, morality served pragmatic functions that extended survival. The struggle to deny the finality of death co-opted and changed the function of these cultural inventions. For example, Neanderthals might have begun burying their dead as a means of avoiding unpleasant odors, disease-infested parasites, or dangerous scavengers. But during the Upper Paleolithic era, these pragmatic burial practices appear to have become imbued with layers of ritual performance and supernatural beliefs, suggested by the elaborate decoration of bodies with thousands of beads or other markers. Food and other necessities were also included within the burial chamber, indicating the potential for a belief system that included life after death. In many human cultures today, funerals are viewed primarily as cultural events, viewed through the lens of morality and language, with little thought given to the utilitarian origins of burying the dead.\n\nEvolutionary history also indicates that \"the costs of ignoring threats have outweighed the costs of ignoring opportunities for self-development.\" This reinforces the concept that abstract needs for individual and group self-esteem may continue to be selected for by evolution, even when they sometimes confer risks to physical health and well-being.\n\nSelf-esteem lies at the heart of TMT and is a fundamental aspect of its core paradigms. TMT fundamentally seeks to elucidate the causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem. Theoretically, it draws heavily from Ernest Becker's conceptions of culture and self-esteem (Becker, 1971; Becker, 1973). TMT not only attempts to explain the concept of self-esteem, it also tries to explain \"why\" we need self-esteem. One explanation is that self-esteem is used as a coping mechanism for anxiety. It helps people control their sense of terror and nullify the realization that humans are just animals trying to manage the world around them. According to TMT, self-esteem is a sense of personal value that is created by beliefs in the validity of one's cultural worldview, and the belief that one is living up to the cultural standards created by that worldview.\n\nCritically, Hewstone \"et al.\" (2002) have questioned the causal direction between self-esteem and death anxiety, evaluating whether one's self-esteem comes from their desire to reduce their death anxiety, or if death anxiety arises from a lack of self-esteem. In other words, an individual's suppression of death anxiety may arise from their overall need to increase their self-esteem in a positive manner.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that self-esteem can play an important role in physical health. In some cases, people may be so concerned with their physical appearance and boosting their self-esteem that they ignore problems or concerns with their own physical health. Arndt \"et al.\" (2009) conducted three studies to examine how peer perceptions and social acceptance of smokers contributes to their quitting, as well as if, and why these people continue smoking for outside reasons, even when faced with thoughts of death and anti-smoking prompts. Tanning and exercising were also looked at in the researchers' studies. The studies found that people are influenced by the situations around them. Specifically, Arndt \"et al.\" (2009) found in terms of their self-esteem and health, that participants who saw someone exercising were more likely to increase their intentions to exercise. In addition, the researchers found in study two that how participants reacted to an anti-smoking commercial was affected by their motivation for smoking and the situation which they were in. For instance, people who smoked for extrinsic reasons and were previously prompted with death reminders were more likely to be compelled by the anti-smoking message.\n\nAn individual's level of self-consciousness can affect their views on life and death. To a point, increasing self-consciousness is adaptive in that it helps prevent awareness of danger. However, research has demonstrated that there may be diminishing returns from this phenomenon. Individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness sometimes have increased death cognition, and a more negative outlook on life, than those with reduced self-consciousness.\n\nConversely, self-esteem can work in the opposite manner. Research has confirmed that individuals with higher self-esteem, particularly in regard to their behavior, have a more positive attitude towards their life. Specifically, death cognition in the form of anti-smoking warnings weren't effective for smokers and in fact, increased their already positive attitudes towards the behavior. The reasons behind individuals' optimistic attitudes towards smoking after mortality was made salient, indicate that people use positivity as a buffer against anxiety. Continuing to hold certain beliefs even after they are shown to be flawed creates cognitive dissonance regarding current information and past behavior, and the way to alleviate this is to simply reject new information. Therefore, anxiety buffers such as self-esteem allow individuals to cope with their fears more easily. Death cognition may in fact cause negative reinforcement that leads people to further engage in dangerous behaviors (smoking in this instance) because accepting the new information would lead to a loss of self-esteem, increasing vulnerability and awareness of mortality.\n\nThe mortality salience hypothesis (MS) states that if indeed one's cultural worldview, or one's self-esteem, serves a death-denying function, then threatening these constructs should produce defenses aimed at restoring psychological equanimity (i.e., returning the individual to a state of feeling invulnerable). In the MS paradigm, these \"threats\" are simply experiential reminders of one's own death. This can, and has, taken many different forms in a variety of study paradigms (e.g., asking participants to write about their own death; conducting the experiment near funeral homes or cemeteries; having participants watch graphic depictions of death, etc.). Like the other TMT hypotheses, the literature supporting the MS hypothesis is vast and diverse. For a meta analysis of MS research, see Burke \"et al.\" (2010).\n\nExperimentally, the MS hypothesis has been tested in close to 200 empirical articles. After participants in an experiment are asked to write about their own death (vs. a neutral, non-death control topic, such as dental pain), and then following a brief delay (distal, worldview/self-esteem defenses work the best after a delay; see Greenberg \"et al.\" (1994) for a discussion), the participants' defenses are measured. In one early TMT study assessing the MS hypothesis, Greenberg \"et al.\" (1990) had Christian participants evaluate other Christian and Jewish students that were similar demographically, but differed in their religious affiliation. After being reminded of their death (experimental MS induction), Christian participants evaluated fellow Christians more positively, and Jewish participants more negatively, relative to the control condition. Conversely, bolstering self-esteem in these scenarios leads to less worldview defense and derogation of dissimilar others.\n\nMortality salience has an influence on individuals and their decisions regarding their health. Cox \"et al.\" (2009) discuss mortality salience in terms of suntanning. Specifically, the researchers found that participants who were prompted with the idea that pale was more socially attractive along with mortality reminders, tended to lean towards decisions that resulted in more protective measures from the sun. The participants were placed in two different conditions; one group of participants were given an article relating to the fear of death, while the control group received an article unrelated to death dealing with the fear of public speaking. Additionally, they gave one group an article pertaining to the message that \"bronze is beautiful,\" one relating to the idea that \"pale is pretty,\" and one neutral article that did not speak of tan or pale skin tones. Finally, after introducing a delay activity, the researchers gave the participants a five-item questionnaire asking them about their future sun-tanning behaviors. The study illustrated that when tan skin was associated with attractiveness, mortality salience positively affected people's intentions to suntan; however, when pale skin was associated with attractiveness people's intentions to tan decreased.\n\nStudies have shown that mortality and self-esteem are important factors of the terror management theory. Jessop \"et al.\" (2008) study this relationship within four studies that all examine how people react when they are given information on risks, specifically, in terms of the mortality related to the risks of driving. More specifically, the researchers were exploring how participants acted in terms of self-esteem, and its impact on how mortality-related health-risk information would be received. Overall, Jessop \"et al.\" (2008) found that even when mortality is prominent, people who engage in certain behaviors to improve their self-esteem have a greater chance of continuing with these activities. Mortality and self-esteem are both factors that influence people's behaviors and decision-making regarding their health. Furthermore, individuals who are involved in behaviors and possess motivation to enhance their self-worth are less likely to be affected by the importance placed on health risks, in terms of mortality.\n\nSelf-esteem is important when mortality is made salient. It can allow people a coping mechanism, one that can cushion individuals' fears; and thus, impacting one's attitudes towards a given behavior. Individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem regarding their behavior(s) are less likely to have their attitudes, and thus their behaviors changed regardless of mortality salient or death messages. People will use their self-esteem to hide behind their fears of dying. In terms of smoking behaviors, people with higher smoking-based self-esteem are less susceptible to anti-smoking messages that relate to death; therefore, mortality salience and death warnings afford them with an even more positive outlook on their behavior, or in this instance their smoking.\n\nIn the Hansen \"et al.\" (2010) experiment the researchers manipulated mortality salience. In the experiment, Hansen \"et al.\" (2010) examined smokers' attitudes towards the behavior of smoking. Actual warning labels were utilized to create mortality salience in this specific experiment. The researchers first gave participants a questionnaire to measure their smoking-based self-esteem. Following the questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to two different conditions; the first were given anti-smoking warning labels about death and the second control group were exposed to anti-smoking warning labels not dealing with death. Before the participants' attitudes towards smoking were taken the researchers introduced an unrelated question to provide a delay. Further research has demonstrated that delays allow mortality salience to emerge because thoughts of death become non-conscious. Finally, participants were asked questions regarding their intended future smoking behavior. However, one weakness in their conduction was that the final questionnaire addressed opinions and behavioral questions, as opposed to the participants level of persuasion regarding the different anti-smoking warning labels.\n\nMany people are more motivated by social pressures, rather than health risks. Specifically for younger people, mortality salience is stronger in eliciting changes of one's behavior when it brings awareness to the immediate loss of social status or position, rather than a loss, such as death that one can not imagine and feels far off. However, there are many different factors to take into consideration, such as how strongly an individual feels toward a decision, his or her level of self-esteem, and the situation around the individual. Particularly with people's smoking behaviors, self-esteem and mortality salience have different effects on individuals' decisions. In terms of the longevity of their smoking decisions, it has been seen that individuals' smoking habits are affected, in the short-term sense, when they are exposed to mortality salience that interrelates with their own self-esteem. Moreover, people who viewed social exclusion prompts were more likely to quit smoking in the long run than those who were simply shown health-effects of smoking. More specifically, it was demonstrated that when individuals had high levels of self-esteem they were more likely to quit smoking following the social pressure messages, rather than the health risk messages. In this specific instance, terror management, and specifically mortality salience is showing how people are more motivated by the social pressures and consequences in their environment, rather than consequences relating to their health. This is mostly seen in young adult smokers with higher smoking-based self-esteems who are not thinking of their future health and the less-immediate effects of smoking on their health.\n\nAnother paradigm that TMT researchers use to get at unconscious concerns about death is what is known as the death thought accessibility (DTA) hypothesis. Essentially, the DTA hypothesis states that if individuals are motivated to avoid cognitions about death, and they avoid these cognitions by espousing a worldview or by buffering their self-esteem, then when threatened, an individual should possess more death-related cognitions (e.g., thoughts about death, and death-related stimuli) than they would when not threatened.\n\nThe DTA hypothesis has its origins in work by Greenberg \"et al.\" (1994) as an extension of their earlier terror management hypotheses (i.e., the anxiety buffer hypothesis and the mortality salience hypothesis). The researchers reasoned that if, as indicated by Wegner's research on thought suppression (1994; 1997), thoughts that are purposely suppressed from conscious awareness are often brought back with ease, then following a delay death-thought cognitions should be more available to consciousness than (a) those who keep the death-thoughts in their consciousness the whole time, and (b) those who suppress the death-thoughts but are not provided a delay. That is precisely what they found. However, other psychologists have failed to replicate these findings.\n\nIn these initial studies (i.e., Greenberg \"et al.\" (2004); Arndt \"et al.\" (1997)), and in numerous subsequent DTA studies, the main measure of DTA is a word fragment task, whereby participants can complete word fragments in distinctly death-related ways (e.g., coff_ _ as coffin, not coffee) or in non death-related ways (e.g., sk_ _l as skill, not skull). If death-thoughts are indeed more available to consciousness, then it stands to reason that the word fragments should be completed in a way that is semantically related to death.\n\nThe introduction of this hypothesis has refined TMT, and led to new avenues of research that formerly could not be assessed due to the lack of an empirically validated way of measuring death-related cognitions. Also, the differentiation between proximal (conscious, near, and threat-focused) and distal (unconscious, distant, symbolic) defenses that have been derived from DTA studies have been extremely important in understanding how people deal with their terror.\n\nIt is important to note how the DTA paradigm subtly alters, and expands, TMT as a motivational theory. Instead of solely manipulating mortality and witnessing its effects (e.g., nationalism, increased prejudice, risky sexual behavior, etc.), the DTA paradigm allows a measure of the death-related cognitions that result from various affronts to the self. Examples include threats to self-esteem and to one's worldview; the DTA paradigm can therefore assess the role of death-thoughts in self-esteem and worldview defenses. Furthermore, the DTA hypothesis lends support to TMT in that it corroborates its central hypothesis that death is uniquely problematic for human beings, and that it is fundamentally different in its effects than meaning threats, (i.e., Heine \"et al.\", 2006) and that is death itself, and not uncertainty and lack of control associated with death; Fritsche \"et al.\" (2008) explore this idea.\n\nSince its inception, the DTA hypothesis had been rapidly gaining ground in TMT investigations, and as of 2009, has been employed in over 60 published papers, with a total of more than 90 empirical studies.\n\nHow people respond to their fears and anxiety of death is investigated in TMT. Moreover, Taubman-Ben-Ari and Noy (2010) examine the idea that a person's level of self-awareness and self-consciousness should be considered in relation to their responses to their anxiety and death cognitions. The more an individual is presented with their death or death cognitions in general, the more fear and anxiety one may have; therefore, to combat said anxiety one may implement anxiety buffers.\n\nDue to a change in people's lifestyles, in the direction of more unhealthy behaviors, the leading causes of death now, being cancer and heart disease, most definitely are related to individuals' unhealthy behaviors (though the statement is over-generalising and certainly cannot be applied to every case). Age and death anxiety both are factors that should be considered in the terror management theory, in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Age undoubtedly plays some kind of role in people's health-promoting behaviors; however, an actual age related effect on death anxiety and health-promoting behaviors has yet to be seen. Although, research has demonstrated that for young adults only, when they were prompted with death related scenarios, they yielded more health-promoting behaviors, compared to those participants in their sixties. In addition, death anxiety has been found to have an effect for young adults, on their behaviors of health promotion.\n\nThe terror management health model (TMHM) explores the role that death plays on one's health and behavior. Goldenberg and Arndt (2008) state that the TMHM proposes the idea that death, despite its threatening nature, is in fact instrumental and purposeful in the conditioning of one's behavior towards the direction of a longer life.\n\nAccording to Goldenberg and Arndt (2008), certain health behaviors such as breast self-exams (BSEs) can consciously activate and facilitate people to think of death, especially their own death. While death can be instrumental for individuals, in some cases, when breast self-exams activate people's death thoughts an obstacle can present itself, in terms of health promotion, because of the experience of fear and threat. Abel and Kruger (2009) have suggested that the stress caused by increased awareness of mortality when celebrating one's birthday might explain the birthday effect, where mortality rates seem to spike around these days.\n\nOn the other hand, death and thoughts of death can serve as a way of empowering the self, not as threats. Researchers, Cooper \"et al.\" (2011) explored TMHM in terms of empowerment, specifically using BSEs under two conditions; when death thoughts were prompted, and when thoughts of death were non-conscious. According to TMHM, people's health decisions, when death thoughts are not conscious, should be based on their motivations to act appropriately, in terms of the self and identity. Cooper \"et al.\" (2011) found that when mortality and death thoughts were primed, women reported more empowerment feelings than those who were not prompted before performing a BSE.\n\nAdditionally, TMHM suggests that mortality awareness and self-esteem are important factors in individuals' decision making and behaviors relating to their health. TMHM explores how people will engage in behaviors, whether positive or negative, even with the heightened awareness of mortality, in the attempt to conform to society's expectations and improve their self-esteem. The TMHM is useful in understanding what motivates individuals regarding their health decisions and behaviors.\n\nIn terms of smoking behaviors and attitudes, the impact of warnings with death messages depends on:\n\nPeople with low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, have more negative emotions when reminded of death. This is believed to be because these individuals lack the very defenses that TMT argues protect people from mortality concerns (e.g., solid worldviews). In contrast, positive mood states are not impacted by death thoughts for people of low or high self-esteem.\n\nIt has been suggested that culture provides meaning, organization, and a coherent world view that diminishes the psychological terror caused by the knowledge of eventual death. The terror management theory can help to explain why a leader's popularity can grow substantially during times of crisis. When a follower's mortality is made prominent they will tend to show a strong preference for iconic leaders. An example of this occurred when George W. Bush's approval rating jumped almost 50 percent following the September 11 attacks in the United States. As Forsyth (2009) posits, this tragedy made U.S. citizens aware of their mortality, and Bush provided an antidote to these existential concerns by promising to bring justice to the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.\n\nResearchers Cohen \"et al.\" (2004), in their particular study on TMT, tested the preferences for different types of leaders, while reminding people of their mortality. Three different candidates were presented to participants. The three leaders were of three different types: task-oriented (emphasized setting goals, strategic planning, and structure), relationship-oriented (emphasized compassion, trust, and confidence in others), and charismatic. The participants were then placed in one of two conditions: mortality salient or control group. In the former condition the participants were asked to describe the emotions surrounding their own death, as well as the physical act of the death itself, whereas the control group were asked similar questions about an upcoming exam. The results of the study were that the charismatic leader was favored more, and the relationship-oriented leader was favored less, in the mortality-salient condition. Further research has shown that mortality salient individuals also prefer leaders who are members of the same group, as well as men rather than women (Hoyt \"et al.\" 2010). This has links to social role theory.\n\nTMT posits that religion was created as a means for humans to cope with their own mortality. Supporting this, arguments in favor of life after death, and simply being religious, reduce the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Thoughts of death have also been found to increase religious beliefs. At an implicit, subconscious level, this is the case even for people who claim to be nonreligious.\n\nPsychologists, especially evolutionary psychologists, have argued against terror management theory. One scholar commented that the field of psychology would be advanced by a study of paralyzed states caused by anxiety that would only be alleviated with the reworking of a person's mental state. These authors instead explain human behavior is selected to urge people to avoid situations likely to lead to death. This suggests that mortality salience effects reflect adaptive responses to solve specific life-threats rather than an unconscious attempt to avoid this realization.\n\nSince findings on mortality salience and worldview defense were first published, other researchers have claimed that the effects may have been obtained due to reasons other than death itself, such as anxiety, fear, or other aversive stimuli such as pain. Other studies have found effects similar to those that MS results in – for example, thinking about difficult personal choices to be made, being made to respond to open-ended questions regarding uncertainty, thinking about being robbed, thinking about being socially isolated, and being told that one's life lacks meaning. While these cases exist, thoughts of death have since been compared to various aversive experimental controls, such as (but not limited to) thinking about: failure, writing a critical exam, public speaking with a considerable audience, being excluded, paralysis, dental pain, intense physical pain, etc.\n\nWith regards to the studies that found similar effects, TMT theorists have argued that in the previously mentioned studies where death was not the subject thought about, the subjects would quite easily be related to death in an individual's mind due to \"linguistic or experiential connection with mortality\" (p. 332) For example, being robbed invokes thoughts of violence and being unsafe in one's own home – many people have died trying to protect their property and family. A second possible explanation for these results involves the death-thought accessibility hypothesis: these threats somehow sabotage crucial anxiety-buffering aspects of an individual's worldview or self-esteem, which increases their DTA. For example, one study found increased DTA in response to thoughts of antagonistic relations with attachment figures.\n\nThe meaning maintenance model (MMM) was initially introduced as a comprehensive motivational theory that claimed to subsume TMT, with alternative explanations for TMT findings. Essentially, it posits that people automatically give meaning to things, and when those meanings are somehow disrupted, it causes anxiety. In response, people concentrate on \"meaning maintenance to reestablish their sense of symbolic unity\" and that such \"meaning maintenance often involves the compensatory reaffirmation of alternative meaning structures\". These meanings, among other things, should \"provide a basis for prediction and control of our...environments, help [one] to cope with tragedy and trauma...and the symbolic cheating of death via adherence to the enduring values that these cultures provide\".\n\nTMT theorists argue that MMM cannot describe why different sets of meaning are preferred for a symbol by different people, and that while they may exist, \"different [(i.e., more concrete)] types of meaning have different psychological functions\". For example, MMM theorists argue that all types of meaning are basically equal, and yet one could not compare the likelihood of defensive responses resulting from exposure to a deck of cards containing black hearts with something like the September 11 attacks. TMT theorists argue, essentially, that unless something is an important element of a person's anxiety-buffering worldview or self-esteem, it will not require broad meaning maintenance.\n\nIn sum, TMT theorists believe that MMM cannot accurately claim to be an alternative to TMT because it does not seem to be able to explain the current breadth of TMT evidence. As an example, TMT theorists assert that mortality salience would not be a threat to meaning, since our eventual demise is a necessary condition of life. Therefore, it should not cause an individual to engage in general meaning maintenance. MMM also makes no attempt to explain why threatening meaning increases DTA.\n\nSome theorists have argued that it is not the idea of death and nonexistence that is unsettling to people, but the fact that uncertainty is involved. For example, these researchers posited that people defend themselves by altering their fear responses from uncertainty to an enthusiasm approach. Other researchers argue for distinguishing fear of death from fear of dying and, therein, posit that ultimately the fear of death has more to do with some other fear (e.g., fear of pain) or reflects fear of the unknown.\n\nTMT theorists agree that uncertainty can be disconcerting in some cases and it may even result in defense responses, but note that they believe the inescapability of death and the possibility of its finality regarding one's existence is most unsettling. They ask, \"'Would death be any less frightening if you knew for certain that it would come next Tuesday at 5:15 p.m., and that your hopes for an afterlife were illusory?'...Would you rather be certain that death is the end, or live with the uncertainty that it might not be?\" They also note that people actually seek out some types of uncertainty, and that being uncertain is not always very unpleasant. In contrast, there is substantial evidence that, all things being equal, uncertainty and the unknown represent fundamental fears and are only experienced as pleasant when there is sufficient contextual certainty. For example, a surprise involves uncertainty, but is only perceived as pleasant if there is sufficient certainty that the surprise will be pleasant. Consider a box received on a birthday from a trusted family member as compared to the box received at the end of the film \"Seven\" (which contains a severed head).\n\nThough TMT theorists acknowledge that many responses to mortality salience involve greater approaches (zealousness) towards important worldviews, they also note examples of mortality salience which resulted in the opposite, which offensive defensiveness cannot account for: when negative features of a group to which participants belong were made salient, people actively distanced themselves from that group under mortality salience.\n\nSeveral critiques have been proposed against TMT from evolutionary psychologists – for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations. Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety. In response, TMT theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually. TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the \"future\". While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases. For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau \"et al.\", 2007. Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,).\n\nCoalitional psychology (CP) is presented as another alternative to TMT, which proposes that there is an evolutionary tendency to seek safety in groups (coalitions) as a reaction to adaptive threats. People already a part of coalitional groups seek to protect their membership by exhibiting their value to the group. TMT theorists answer by arguing that CP 1) cannot account for the fact that virtually all cultures have a supernatural dimension; 2) it does not explain why cultural worldview defense is symbolic, involving allegiance to both specific and general systems of abstract meaning unrelated to specific threats, rather than focused on the specific adaptive threats it supposedly evolved to deal with; 3) it dismisses TMT's dual process account of the underlying processes that generate MS effects without providing an alternative of any kind or attempting to account for the data relevant to this aspect of the TMT analysis and 4) the experiments testing hypotheses derived from CP do not provide compelling or unique support for CP, 5) it cannot account for a host of empirical findings supporting hypotheses derived from TMT that could never be deduced from CP.\n\nIn addition to the criticisms from alternative theoretical perspectives, Many Labs 4 failed to replicate the mortality salience results. A large scale effort to test the theory failed to obtain support for the mortality salience effect on worldview defense, i.e. a greater preference for an essay writer adopting a pro-U.S. argument than an essay writer adopting an anti-U.S. argument. The test is a multi-lab replication of Study 1 of Greenberg et al. (1994). Psychologists in 21 labs across the U.S. re-executed the original experiment, among a total of 2,200 participants. In response to the Many Labs 4 paper, Tom Pyszczynski (one of the founding phycologists of TMT), stated ML4 \"deviated from their pre-registered protocol and failed to mention these deviations\" and further \"failure to follow their (highly justified) preregistered protocol has led to incorrect conclusions that have become widely publicized and have inadvertently done more damage than good to our common goal of improving psychological science.\"\n\n\n\n\nDiscusses TMT at length\n\nTMT and self-esteem\n"}

The English family feuded with the Durbin family for years, which led to three of Buck's brothers dying. When Buck was thirteen, he became obligated to take revenge on the Durbin family. Unlike Black Bart, Lake County's other notorious thief, Buck was rash and openly flaunted his overconfident capacity.\n\nHe was only 22 years old when he and a companion held up the Lower Lake stage coach and took the Wells Fargo strongbox from the driver. Instead of the usual gold or silver for the miners, the box yielded only two brass castings. The local newspaper later said, \"Shortly before this robbery, he and his companion met four Chinese miners coming down from the Great Western Mine (near Middletown), and robbed them of their watches and money.\"\n\nWells Fargo strongboxes were often the target of stagecoach robbers in Middletown. After the mid-19th century, the payroll money was brought in on the stagecoach with an armed guard beside the driver. Not all of the holdups in the area were the doing of Buck and his gang, although he was a scourge to the local vicinity for a number of years. Buck worked the road near Mountain Hill House, south of Middletown, or near the double bridge north of Middletown near Lower Lake. For 20 years, Buck roamed the countryside, making little effort to hide his identity or his disreputable enterprise.\n\nBuck walked the streets of Middletown with a six-shooter strapped to his side, daring any who insulted his authority to a contest. One day, he ran into Captain Good on the main street, and harsh words were exchanged. Later in the day, they met again, and this time it was a shooting affair, with Buck emerging unscathed. The captain was seriously wounded in the arm and legs. In another unrelated incident, Buck shot and killed a man in the Middletown skating rink, turning the arena into a scene of pandemonium.\n\nAfter his release from San Quentin in 1882, Buck returned to Middletown. Soon after his arrival, the Lebree store in town was robbed of some watches and jewelry.\n\nBuck left Middletown for a few years, but upon his return, he showed he had not changed. It was not long before he held up the stage at the foot of Mount Saint Helena, near the summer home of the mayor of San Francisco. The six passengers were ordered out of the stage, and stripped of their possessions. Buck made no effort to hide his identity. He greeted the driver of a passing wagon, who quickly drove on when he realized a robbery was in progress.\n\nThis occurred on May 7, 1895. A posse was formed and they set off to capture Buck. They discovered him on a stagecoach going from Monticello to Napa, and a wild chase ensued. The \"San Francisco Examiner\" reported the next day:\n\nOne of the robbers jumped to the horses ahead and leveled his guns. He waved weapons and spouted profanity, all the while threatening to \"blow\" the driver off of the seat. The two robbers were armed with old style Colt revolvers, and he cursed at everyone, especially the Chinamen\n\nThe capture of Buck by Sheriff Bell reads like a Wild West novel. He was so badly wounded and had lost so much blood that many thought he would not survive. He did recover, however, and returned to San Quentin to serve yet another sentence.\n\nBuck was not as well known as Black Bart and other Western gunmen of the time, but he created fear wherever he went. Although he was arrested for his robberies and attacks on the general population, Buck had his hands in many other criminal activities, including cattle rustling, which he served less than a year in jail for.\n\nBuck ended up living long enough to enjoy freedom again after his release from prison. He died in San Francisco on January 15, 1915 of natural causes, unlike his brothers, all of whom all died violent deaths.\n\n"}

The workstation/ROMpler was based on AI², an improved version of the AI (Advanced Integrated) Synthesis technology found in the M1. The success of the AI² architecture ensured it was used in the majority of subsequent Korg synths of the 1990s.\n\n\nThere was also the subsequent Korg 05R/W half size 1U rack unit released in 1993. In spite of its name it was actually based on the Korg X3 and essentially served as a prelude to the X3's successor, the original Korg X5 keyboard that was released the following year. It was GM compliant and, while it didn't include a sequencer and had only half as many patches, it did include a serial interface for Mac/PC.\n\n\nThe 01/W only had a few of the M1's samples. Particularly missing were the M1 Acoustic Piano, and some of the M1 Electric Piano sounds. These were replaced by more realistic versions (the Acoustic Piano in the 01/W was radically different and sounded more oriented for classical music). The 01/Wpro even went a step further and added another even more realistic Acoustic Piano.\n\nThe M1's piano was so bright and metallic sounding that it found its niche in Dance/Electronica and some Latin Music where it could cut through the mix easily. Korg acknowledged this fact by integrating their M1 piano back on later incarnations of the X range, such as in the X5D synth and N264/364 workstations.\n\nThe 01/W also added more electric piano sounds, having at least 5 times as many, therefore becoming one of the standard keyboards used in smooth jazz, which often uses electric piano sounds.\n\nThe 01/W introduced a feature called \"Waveshaping\". This was a feature where each sample value was run through a non-linear function, and thereby producing new harmonics. This is similar to the way a tube amp distorts sound. It was possible to select from 59 different waveshapes having names like \"Rezzy\", \"Parabola\" & \"Comb\", to transform/distort the sound. Waveshaping would add different harmonics to the sound depending on the selected waveshape, but the added harmonics depended also heavily on what kind of sample that was fed into the waveshaping function. The waveshaping feature could make some very interesting sonic textures as it would literally reshape the sound to fit that specific waveshape. However, the feature was discontinued on subsequent models. Original sounds were achievable but required significant experimentation, as using waveshaping on stock samples often only seemed to add distortion.\n\nThe 0 series took a step backward from the T series in one area: the 1-megabyte sample RAM, on which users could load their own multisamples, was removed. More current workstations almost invariably have integrated samplers or user sample playback features.\n\nThe 01/W is also known for its \"warmth\". It has been suggested the 01/W sounded richer than the Korg synths that came afterward. The two most probable reasons for that are:\n\nThe fact that the 01/W's samples were recorded at a slightly lower sampling rate, therefore reducing sample size, plus the advantage of having more ROM memory meant that longer samples could be stored, possibly adding more realism to sustained sounds and so forth. The 32 kHz frequency might give the illusion of a more acoustic instrument, because it might be perceived as reducing the amount of high frequencies, which tend to be attenuated in physical/analogue instruments when compared to digital ones.\n\n\nReportedly, the 01/W was originally intended to be named the M10, but the marketing department read the name upside down.\n\nJun Senoue sampled one of the snare sounds from the 01/w while scoring the soundtrack to the video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3. this sample would later be used in Sonic and Knuckles and the genesis version of Sonic 3d blast.\nThe acoustic snare sound is part of the standard drum kit of the fpd98 software midi synthesiser for pc.\n\n\n"}

NGES had originally been created by Northrop Grumman's acquisition of Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group in 1996. The Electronic Systems sector was a leading designer, developer, and manufacturer of a wide variety of advanced defense electronics and systems. The division had 120 locations worldwide, including 72 international offices, and approximately 24,000 employees. Accounting for 20% of company sales in 2005, it was the single largest sector (business unit) in the corporation.\n\nHeadquartered in Linthicum, Maryland (about a mile away from BWI Airport, near Baltimore), Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems was organized thus:\n\nNorthrop Grumman Electronic Systems provided airborne radar systems, secondary surveillance systems, inertial navigation systems and sensors, electronic warfare systems, precision weapons, air traffic control systems, air defense systems, communications systems, space systems, marine systems, naval systems, integrated avionics systems, and postal automation and information systems. \n\nKey products included Active electronically scanned array fire control radars for the F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, as well as the Longbow Fire Control Radar for the AH-64 Apache helicopter. Other principal products included the AWACS radar, the Boeing 737-based Wedgetail MESA airborne early warning and control system, E-8 Joint STARS air-to-ground surveillance radar sensor, the Longbow Hellfire missile, the ALQ-135 radar jammer for the F-15 Eagle, ALQ-218 Tactical Jamming Receiver for the EA-18G Growler and EA-6B ICAP III Prowler, tactical military radars, countrywide air defense systems, Directional Infrared Counter Measures, sophisticated undersea warfare systems, and naval propulsion and power generation systems.\n\nElectronic Systems' direct roots date to 1938, when Westinghouse Electric Corporation’s Radio Division moved to Baltimore, Maryland from Massachusetts and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1939, Westinghouse more than doubled its manufacturing area in its Baltimore location to accommodate production of the then highly-secret SCR-270 aircraft warning radar. In 1941, an SCR-270 radar detected the December 7 attack on Pearl Harbor; its warnings went unheeded because of high-level uncertainty about the new technology's reliability. The first ground-based radar built for the Army Signal Corps, the SCR-270 proved to be the only model to stay in action throughout all of World War II. From 1941–1945 the Westinghouse Radio Division manufactured approximately 50 products during the war. Until 1942, most of this was radio equipment; later production shifted to radar products. Wartime production included ground-based and naval radio and radar, electronic fuses, and torpedoes.\n\nIn 1953, the unit patented key technologies for Pulse-Doppler radar, making possible airborne systems that can detect both stationary and moving targets, determine range, and distinguish targets from background \"clutter.\" Pulse-Doppler is the basis for all airborne radars in use today. By 1966, the division designed and developed a miniaturized black-and-white camera that captured images from the Project Apollo Lunar Module that landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. In 1967, The world's first solid-state radar, the AN/APQ-120 for the F-4 Phantom II fighter, was produced by the division. In 1947, Westinghouse acquired Joshua Hendy Iron Works.\n\nIn 1974, the division began development of the AN/APG-66 radar for the F-16; to date the unit has produced over 6,000 radars for various versions of the F-16. In 1976, Westinghouse Electronic Systems delivered the first E-3 Sentry AWACS long-range airborne surveillance radar. In 1996, Westinghouse was selected to design, build and test the radar for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, what became the AN/APG-81.\n\nElectronic Systems has been central to Northrop Grumman's aggressive merger and acquisition strategy since its own acquisition in 1996. Parts or all of the following companies or organizations were part of the sector: Westinghouse Electronic Systems, California Microwave, Litton Industries Advanced Electronics division, Solystic SA, Xetron Corporation, Aerojet Corporation Electronics & Information Systems, and Fibersense Technology Corp. During the period from 1996 to 2005, Electronic Systems' annual sales increased from US$2.3B to US$6.6B through organic growth as well as acquisitions.\n\n"}

When you've spent that length of time acquiring history, building something up to where it had international prestige, then see it all disappear in a couple of hours, what else can it be?\"\n\nBefore the fire, plans had already been under way to move the museum to the larger Ford Building, also in Balboa Park, which had been built for the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition. Even though several important historic aircraft were lost in the fire, much of the collection on display was dated or insignificant. The museum was already accumulating new aircraft that were in storage awaiting space in the new building and so were spared from the fire. In addition, the community rallied, raising funds and donating items from private collections. The museum reopened, with a smaller but growing collection, in its current home in the former Ford Building on June 28, 1980. A new reproduction of the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" was built for the new museum. Because of its historical significance, a reproduction of the Wee Bee was also built.\n\nIn 2005 the museum became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. It is one of only ten aerospace museums in the country to have such an affiliation, and one of only two affiliated museums in San Diego.\n\nThe museum is divided into many galleries with exhibits emphasizing the contributions San Diego has made to aviation. Sections include the Theodore Gildred Rotunda, Special Exhibit area, World War I Gallery, Golden Age of Flight Gallery, World War II Gallery, and Modern Jet & Space Age Gallery, and the Edwin D. McKeller Pavilion of Flight. Admission is required and there is an additional cost to see the Special Exhibit.\n\nThe restoration shop on site is available for tours when work is being done.\n\nIn addition to the Apollo 9 Command Module \"Gumdrop\", the main entrance to the museum contains examples of aircraft from local San Diego companies. It also features the different types of exhibits throughout the museum. This includes originals, like the Montgomery 1911 Evergreen glider, models, like the 1/2 scale model of the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk, flyable reproductions, like the Curtiss A-1 amphibious aircraft, replicas, like the Ryan Aeronautical NYP (aka \"Spirit of St. Louis\"), and flight vehicles, like the Ryan Firebee and General Atomics MQ-1 Predator.\n\nIn addition to the changing special exhibits at the front of the museum, there are a number of early aviation exhibits hanging from the ceiling. Visitors are encouraged to look up while making their way through the special exhibit. Guests who do not pay to see the special exhibit pass through the Hall of Fame hallway where portraits of aviation pioneers are displayed. Also along this hallway are exhibits about Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Cochran and the Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nHanging above this area are exhibits of the Leonardo da Vinci Ornithopter (mock-up), Cayley Glider (reproduction), Lilienthal Glider (reproduction), Chanute Glider (reproduction), 1901 Wright Glider (reproduction), 1902 Wright Glider (reproduction), Deperdussin 1911 Type Militaire, Beachey \"Little Looper\" (reproduction), and Wright EX Vin Fiz Flyer.\n\nThe museum also has the California lunar sample displays.\n\nIn addition to the boardwalk and era-style tent similar to those used by the Lafayette Escadrille, the gallery has reproductions of an Albatros D.Va, a Fokker Dr.I and Fokker E.III Eindecker, and authentic examples of a SPAD VII.c.1, Nieuport 28, and Sopwith Pup. The fabric skin of the Sopwith Pup was left off to make visible the complex structure and craftsmanship that went into the original aircraft, as well as these museum reproductions. Among the many displays is a model of the synchronization gear first developed for the Fokker Eindecker. With the press of a button, guests can see how the propeller and rotary engine would move and coordinate the trigger action so pilots wouldn't shoot off their own propellers in combat.\n\nAlong the long back stretch of this gallery are many aircraft both on the deck and hanging from the ceiling. Aircraft in this section include a Lincoln Standard J-1, Consolidated PT-1 Trusty, Aeronca C-3 Collegian, Ryan M-1 (replica), Fleet Model 2, Curtiss B-1 Robin, Gee Bee R-1, Bowlus SP-1 Albatross (reproduction), Ryan B-5 Brougham, Ryan STA, Piper J-3 Cub, and Pitts Special.\n\nThe museum also has a number of aircraft engines on display. This gallery contains a Curtis OX-5, Aeronca E-107, Liberty L12-A, Wright J-3 Whirlwind, Curtiss Conqueror V-1570, Jacobs L-4MB (cutaway), Menasco 4A, and Continental A-40.\n\nThe Curtiss JN-4D \"Jenny\" was returned to the restoration shop to reskin the wings.\n\nAccess to the Edwin D. McKeller Pavilion of Flight is from this portion of the museum. This is also where the Education Center is which hosts monthly Family Day activities. Guests will also locate the restrooms for the museum in this section of the building. On some days lunch is available on the outer patio outside of this portion of the museum.\n\nThere is an exhibit of the Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), also known as the Poor Sailor's Airline, in the museum. A replica of the airline's first ticket office has displays about the airline with a smile and includes stewardess uniforms from the 1950s through 1980s, including the hot pants worn during the 1970s.\n\nPSA Flight 182, registration N533PS, a Boeing 727-214 commercial airliner collided with a private Cessna 172 over San Diego on September 25, 1978. A memorial plaque honoring those who died on Flight 182 and on the ground is located at the museum, near the Theodore Gildred Flight Rotunda. On the 20th anniversary of the tragedy, a tree was planted next to the North Park branch library, and a memorial plaque was dedicated to those who lost their lives.\n\nThe latest addition to the museum is the Horton 229 flying wing which was put on display July 2009. This was donated to the museum's permanent collection by Northrop Grumman (owners of Ryan Aeronautical) following radar testing at the same test site which was used for the B-2 stealth bomber. Details of the work on the model and the history of the aircraft were featured on the National Geographic Channel's documentary, Hitler's Stealth Fighter. This is the only Horten wing on public display.\n\nOther aircraft in this portion of the museum include a Stearman N2S-3 Kaydet, Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, North American P-51D Mustang, Douglas C-47 (CD-3) Nose and Cockpit section, Messerschmitt Bf 109G-14 (mock-up), Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XVI.\n\nThis section of the museum is also where a mock-up of the USS Yorktown (CV-10) was built. This Essex Class aircraft carrier has many of the Navy aircraft on display, including a Douglas SBD-4 Dauntless, Grumman F6F-3 Hellcat, and Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat. Racing just feet over the deck, guests will see a Mitsubishi A6M7 Zero-sen.\n\nThroughout the gallery are many of the aircraft engines which were used during this period. On display are a Junkers Jumo 004B-1, Allison V-1710-39, Walter RI-202B, Rolls-Royce Merlin 62, Pratt & Whitney R-2800, Pratt & Whitney R-1830-17, Wright Cyclone 1820, Ranger 6-440C-2, and Ranger SGV-770C-1.\n\nThis gallery contains a Bee Aviation Wee Bee (replica), Douglas A-4B Skyhawk, F/A-18 A Hornet \"Blue Angel 1\", Gemini spacecraft (replica), and the a Apollo Command and Service Module mock-up.\n\nAt the far end of the gallery is the Boeing GPS-12 Satellite. This was an operational ground spare. Launched into space for the original GPS constellation were 23 operational spacecraft and two on orbit spares. A number of spares were flight ready on the ground in case there were malfunctions on orbit, these spacecraft could be launched as replacements. When the next generation of spacecraft were developed, the ground spares were no longer needed and one was donated to the museum. On display is a flight-ready GPS satellite.\n\nAlong the inside wall of this gallery is the cockpit canopy of the North American X-15. This supersonic rocket plane first flew on June 8, 1959 with Scott Crossfield at the controls. Also in the display case near the canopy is Crossfield's flight suit from the X-15 and the air conditional case used by Neil Armstrong when he was an X-15 pilot. Eight of the X-15 pilots flew into space (above 60 miles) to earn their astronaut wings.\n\nThe many astronauts who grew up and lived in the San Diego area include Wally Schirra, the only astronaut to command missions in Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.\n\nThe original courtyard of the Ford Building was used like a showroom during the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition. Now it houses many of the larger aircraft in the museum's collection. These aircraft include the Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17, Mercury spacecraft (mock-up), Bell AH-1E Cobra, and Ford 5-AT-B Trimotor.\n\nThe McDonnell Douglas F-4J/S Phantom II on display in the pavilion was the aircraft flown by Duke Cunningham and William P. Driscoll in Vietnam from the USS \"Constellation\" (CV-64). Cunningham was the first ace to get all of his kills with missiles. The aircraft here has both radar guided Sparrow missiles along the belly and infrared heat seeking Sidewinder missiles loaded on the wings.\n\nThe museum also rents the pavilion to special events from lectures to dinners. Upon request volunteer museum docents can be available to provide additional information about the exhibits during these events.\n\nOn display outside the museum are the Lockheed A-12 and Convair YF2Y-1 Sea Dart.\n\nThe museum hosts a number of lectures, student programs, and other special events. Groups can rent the Pavilion of Flight for their own event or dinner.\n\n\n"}

Hume (January 23, 1827–May 18, 1904) was one of the American West's premier lawmen.\n\nBorn in Stamford Township, Delaware County, New York, he left home in 1850 headed for the gold fields of California with his brother John. Hume panned gold and mined for a number of years in addition to operating a trade store off and on. In 1860 he began his career as a peace officer serving as deputy tax collector for El Dorado County, California. In 1864 he was elected City Marshal of Placerville, California, and in 1864 hired as Undersheriff of El Dorado County. He ran for Sheriff in 1865 and remained in office until 1870. In 1871 Wells, Fargo & Company hired him as a detective, but gave him a year's leave in 1872 to serve as deputy warden of the Nevada State Prison. He became one of the most prominent detectives of the times. He married Lida Munson on April 28, 1884, and had a son, Samuel James Hume. He never retired from the company, but after an illness in 1897 he slowed down and began working fewer road trips. He died at his home in Berkeley, California.\n\nOne of Hume's most famous cases was that of Black Bart. Black Bart may have been a cunning and intelligent stage coach robber, but detective Hume was an equally skilled lawman who eventually brought Bart to justice. James B. Hume had an impressive record as a California and Nevada lawman before he joined the Wells Fargo freight company in 1873. In both appearances and actions he had all the characteristics of a model western lawman: he was tall, handsome, modest, reticent, quietly efficient, and resourceful in his use of modern detection methods, including the science of ballistics.\n\nHume had been trailing Black Bart almost from the beginning of the thief’s career. He visited the sites of all the robberies and patiently put together a valuable list of information. Witnesses in settlements near the scenes of the robberies described seeing a polite, friendly man in his fifties, about five foot eight or ten in height with brownish gray hair, a fierce gray mustache and matching goatee, carrying a bedroll (which Hume correctly inferred carried his duster, sack disguise, shotgun and loot), passing through on foot and quickly disappearing. Hume made special note of the reports by several witnesses that the man’s boots were neatly slit at the toes as if to relieve corns – small wonder, given the territory Bart covered on foot (he never traveled by horse). Hume was well aware that this figure the locals had reported was likely to be the culprit.\n\nHume’s major break occurred on November 3, 1883, when Bart robbed a Wells Fargo coach headed from the town of Sonora to Milton, in Calaveras County. One of the drivers fired a shot at Bart, and forced him to promptly flee. Within the nearby brush, local officers found a cache of rations and correctly assumed that the goods were the bandit's. More importantly however, a blood-stained handkerchief bearing the laundry mark \"F.X.0.7\" was recovered. Hume had previous engaged as a special detective Harry Morse, former sheriff of Alameda County, who now spent a week visiting every laundry in San Francisco – nearly a hundred of them, to track down where the mark originated. Eventually Morse inquired its origin at a laundry on Bush Street in San Francisco. The proprietor identified the F.X.0.7 handkerchief mark as that assigned to C.E. Bolton, a man who lived in a hotel on Second Street. The arrest of Black Bart was at hand. Morse got Bart to accompany him to Hume's office in the nearby Wells Fargo building, and after a thorough grilling, Bart eventually confessed and receive a term in San Quentin prison.\n\nHume and Morse were real detectives in a time when law work, outside of the Pinkerton Agency and Wells Fargo Operations, consisted principally of forming posses, serving warrants with a gun, and preventing mobs from lynching the miscreants. Few lawmen in 1883 put their noses on the carpet and searched for clues in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes (Holmes had not yet surfaced – his first adventure was published in 1887) and not many did the legwork that ended Black Bart’s escapades.\n\nHume's sister Mary married Mathew McClaughry in Kortwright, New York. Their oldest son Robert W. McClaughry served as a major in the 118th Illinois Infantry during the American Civil War. R.W. McClaughry would later serve as the Chicago Chief of Police, Warden of Joliet Prison and was the second warden of the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, KS.\n\nIn \"The Bandits of Panamint,\" the fifteenth episode of the first season of the syndicated television series \"Death Valley Days\", George Sherwood plays \"Detective Hume\" in a dramatization of Hume's pursuit of some stage robbers who, while on the run, have discovered a rich silver mine and devise a way to figure out how to register their claim without going to jail.\n\nIn \"Black Bart,\" the sixteenth episode of the first season of \"Stories of the Century\", the show's protagonist, Railroad Detective Matt Clark (Jim Davis) portrays the role that Hume played in real life.\n\nIn \"Black Bart,\" the fourth episode from the third season of \"Death Valley Days\", the battle of wits between Hume, played by John Damler, and a wily stage robber is dramatized.\n\n\"Temporary Warden,\" the first episode of the fourteenth season of \"Death Valley Days\", dramatizes an incident from the career of Hume, played by Ronald Reagan, in which, after accepting a temporary appointment as warden of the Nevada State Prison in Carson City, he tracks down a trio of escaped convicts who had been terrorizing the state.\n\n"}
{"id": "2289967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2289967", "title": "Comedo", "text": "Comedo\n\nA comedo is a clogged hair follicle (pore) in the skin. Keratin (skin debris) combines with oil to block the follicle. A comedo can be open (blackhead) or closed by skin (whitehead) and occur with or without acne. The word \"comedo\" comes from the Latin \"comedere\", meaning 'to eat up', and was historically used to describe parasitic worms; in modern medical terminology, it is used to suggest the worm-like appearance of the expressed material.\n\nThe chronic inflammatory condition that usually includes both comedones, inflamed papules and pustules (pimples), is called acne. Infection causes inflammation and the development of pus. Whether a skin condition classifies as acne depends on the amount of comedones and infection. Comedones should not be confused with sebaceous filaments.\n\nComedo-type ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not related to the skin conditions discussed here. DCIS is a non-invasive form of breast cancer, but comedo-type DCIS may be more aggressive and so may be more likely to become invasive.\n\nOil production in the sebaceous glands increases during puberty, causing comedones and acne to be common in adolescents. Acne is also found premenstrually and in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Smoking may worsen acne.\n\nOxidation rather than poor hygiene or dirt causes blackheads to be black. Washing or scrubbing the skin too much could make it worse, by irritating the skin. Touching and picking at comedones might cause irritation and spread infection. It is not clear what effect shaving has on the development of comedones or acne.\n\nSome, but not all, skin products might increase comedones by blocking pores, and greasy hair products (like pomades) can worsen acne. Skin products that claim to not clog pores may be labeled noncomedogenic or non-acnegenic. Make-up and skin products that are oil-free and water-based may be less likely to cause acne. It is not known whether dietary factors or sun exposure make comedones better, worse or have no effect.\n\nA hair that does not emerge normally, an ingrown hair, can also block the pore and cause a bulge or lead to infection (causing inflammation and pus).\n\nGenes may play a role in the chances of developing acne. Comedones may be more common in some ethnic groups. People of Latino and recent African descent may experience more inflammation in comedones, more comedonal acne, and earlier onset of inflammation.\n\nComedones are associated with the pilosebaceous unit, which includes a hair follicle and sebaceous gland. These units are mostly on the face, neck, upper chest, shoulders and back. Excess keratin combined with sebum can plug the opening of the follicle. This small plug is called a microcomedo. Androgens increase sebum (oil) production. If sebum continues to build up behind the plug, it can enlarge and form a visible comedo.\n\nA comedone may be open to the air (\"blackhead\") or closed by skin (\"whitehead\"). Being open to the air causes oxidation, which turns it black. \"Cutibacterium acnes\" is the suspected infectious agent in acne. It can proliferate in sebum and cause inflamed pustules (pimples) characteristic of acne. Nodules are inflamed, painful deep bumps under the skin.\n\nComedones that are 1 mm or larger are called macrocomedones. They are closed comedones and are more frequent on the face than neck.\n\nSolar comedones (sometimes called senile comedones) are related to many years of exposure to the sun, usually on the cheeks, not to acne-related pathophysiology.\n\nUsing non-oily cleansers and mild soap may not cause as much irritation to the skin as regular soap. Blackheads can be removed across an area with commercially available pore-cleansing strips (which can still damage the skin by leaving the pores wide open and ripping excess skin) or the more aggressive cyanoacrylate method used by dermatologists.\n\nSqueezing blackheads and whiteheads can remove them, but it can also damage the skin. Doing so increases the risk of causing or transmitting infection and scarring, as well as potentially pushing any infection deeper into the skin. Comedo extractors are used with careful hygiene in beauty salons and by dermatologists, usually after using steam or warm water.\n\nComplementary medicine options for acne in general have not been shown to be effective in trials. These include aloe vera, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), fruit-derived acids, kampo (Japanese herbal medicine), ayurvedic herbal treatments and acupuncture.\n\nSome acne treatments target infection specifically, but there are treatments that are aimed at the formation of comedones as well. Others remove the dead layers of the skin and may help clear blocked pores.\n\nDermatologists can often extract open comedones with minimal skin trauma, but closed comedones are more difficult. Laser treatment for acne might reduce comedones, but dermabrasion and laser therapy have also been known to cause scarring.\n\nMacrocomedones (1 mm or larger) can be removed by a dermatologist using surgical instruments or cauterized with a device that uses light. The acne drug isotretinoin can cause severe flare-ups of macrocomedones, so dermatologists recommend removal before starting the drug and during treatment.\n\nSome research suggests that the common acne medications retinoids and azelaic acid are beneficial and do not cause increased pigmentation of the skin. If using a retinoid, sunscreen is recommended.\n\nFavre–Racouchot syndrome occurs in sun-damaged skin and includes open and closed comedones.\n\nNevus comedonicus or comedo nevus is a benign hamartoma (birthmark) of the pilosebaceous unit around the oil-producing gland in the skin. It has widened open hair follicles with dark keratin plugs that resemble comedones, but they are not actually comedones.\n\nDowling-Degos disease is a genetic pigment disorder that includes comedo-like lesions and scars.\n\nFamilial dyskeratotic comedones is a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition, with keratotic (tough) papules and comedo-like lesions.\n\n"}

He played in seven other Mexican clubs: León, Necaxa, Puebla, Querétaro, Cruz Azul, Atlante, and Veracruz. He was a left footed player with a great talent for free kicks as well as an extraordinary playmaker. His best times were in León and Atlante.\n\nHe retired as a player at Atlante after the 1994-1995 season and scored 2 goals in his last game (Atlante 6-6 Puebla). In total, Romano scored 102 goals in the Mexican Football League.

Peterson was a southpaw starting pitcher who enjoyed his best success in 1970 with the Yankees when he went 20–11 and pitched in the All-Star game. He is widely known for trading families with teammate Mike Kekich in the early 1970s. He had a career record of 133–131.\n\nFritz Peterson has the lowest ratio of base on balls per innings pitched for any left-handed pitcher to pitch in the major leagues since the 1920s.\n\nPeterson attended Arlington High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He was the number two pitcher on his high school team, behind Gene Dahlquist, who went on to play college football at the University of Arizona and professionally for the Norfolk Neptunes in the Continental Football League. Arlington High School produced several major league baseball players, including Paul Splittorff, Dick Bokelmann, and George Vukovich. He attended college at Northern Illinois University. He was viewed as a promising hockey player and gave up playing hockey to concentrate on baseball. He was signed by the New York Yankees in 1963 as an amateur free agent by Yankee scout Lou Maguolo.\n\nPeterson and Splittorff pitched against each other twice during their careers, with Peterson winning both matchups. On August 17, 1971, the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 2–0 at Yankee Stadium (in the days before the Designated Hitter, both pitchers went 0–2 at the plate), and on August 22, 1975 at the old Royals Stadium, the Indians beat the Royals, 9–5.\n\nAfter signing with the Yankees, Peterson was assigned to the Rookie Appalachian League team in Harlan, Kentucky. In twelve games (ten starts), he went 4–3, with a 4.43 ERA; he struck out 80 batters in 61 innings pitched. He also hit .273 with one Home Run. His first professional baseball manager was Gary Blaylock. He played Winter Ball in the 1964 Florida East Coast Instructional League; he had a 7–2 record with a 1.68 ERA, striking out 45 batters in 59 innings.\n\nIn 1964, he played for the Yankees Class A Western Carolinas League farm team in Shelby, North Carolina. In 21 starts, Peterson amassed a 10–7 record, with a 2.73 ERA; he struck out a team-leading 194 batters in 155 innings. He also hit .345 with four Home Runs.\n\nPeterson was even more impressive in his third season. Assigned to the Class A Carolinas League farm team in Greensboro, North Carolina, Peterson had an 11–1 record in fourteen starts, with a 1.50 ERA, and 83 strikeouts in 108 innings. He was later moved up to the Confederate Yankees in the Class AA Southern League in Columbus, Georgia. He went 5–5 with a 2.18 ERA in twelve starts with 62 Strikeouts in 91 innings. His teammates in Columbus included future Yankees Steve Whitaker, Stan Bahnsen, Mike Hegan, Mike Ferraro, and Roy White.\n\nYankees minor league pitching coach Cloyd Boyer is credited with helping Peterson become a star pitcher.\n\nPeterson was invited to spring training with the Yankees in 1966. Yankees manager Johnny Keane was high on Peterson, telling reporters that he averaged three strikeouts for every walk in the minors. At age 24, he became the number two starter on the Yankees pitching staff.\n\nHe made his major league debut on Friday, April 15, 1966 against the Baltimore Orioles. Before a crowd of 35,624 at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Peterson pitched a complete game, striking out three batters and walking none. The Yankees won 3–2, giving Peterson his first major league victory. Future Hall of Famer Frank Robinson hit a solo home run off of Peterson in the ninth inning, but he got Brooks Robinson to fly out to left and Boog Powell grounded out to first to give the Yankees the win. The losing pitcher was Wally Bunker. His first major league strikeouts were Paul Blair, Andy Etchebarren, and Bunker.\n\n\"Where the vintage pitchers like Whitey Ford, Pedro Ramos and Bob Friend had failed, Frederick (Fritz) Peterson succeeded yesterday for the New York Yankees. In his first major league game, the 24-year-old left-hander beat the Baltimore Orioles, 3–2, and drew an accolade from his manager, Johnny Keane,\" the New York Times wrote of his debut. Keane said: \"Not many young pitchers have his control. That's his strength, that and his fastball.\"\nThe Yankees starting lineup for Peterson's first game was: Bobby Richardson at 2B, Roy White in CF, Roger Maris in RF, Tom Tresh in LF, Joe Pepitone at 1B, Clete Boyer at 3B, Elston Howard at C, and Bobby Murcer at SS.\n\nIn his rookie season, Peterson went 12–11 in 32 starts for the Yankees. He had a 3.31 ERA with 96 strikeouts in 215 innings. He tied Mel Stottlemyre (12–20) as the team leader in wins. The Yankees finished last in the American League that season with a 70–89 (.440) record. Keane was replaced during the season with a new manager, Ralph Houk.\n\nPeterson wore #52 on his uniform during his rookie season, and switched to #19 in 1967 after Bob Friend was traded to the New York Mets.\n\nPeterson went 8–14 in 1967 (3.47 ERA, 102 strikeouts), 12–11 in 1968 (2.63 ERA, 115 strikeouts), and 17–16 in 1969 (2.55 ERA, 150 strikeouts). He had the best season of his career in 1970, with a 20–11 record (2.90 ERA, 127 strikeouts). He went 15–13 in 1971 (3.05 ERA, 130 strikeouts), 17–15 in 1972 (3.24 ERA, 100 strikeouts), and 8–15 in 1973 (3.95 ERA, 59 strikeouts). In 1969 and 1970, Peterson had the best strikeout-to-walk ratios in the AL. Peterson also led the league in fewest walks per 9 innings pitched 5 years in a row, 1968–1972. The last pitcher who did that 5 years in a row was Cy Young. In 1970 and 1975, he had the 10th-best win-loss percentages in the league.\n\nDuring the final game at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, September 21, 2008, ESPN Sports announced that Fritz Peterson had the all-time lowest earned run average at Yankee Stadium, with a 2.52 ERA. Whitey Ford was second with a 2.55 ERA. The honor is permanent since Yankee Stadium has been demolished. Peterson was the starting pitcher for the Yankees in the last game played at the original Yankee Stadium, which was completely renovated after the final game of the 1973 season.\n\nIn his nine years as a Yankees pitcher, Peterson had a 109–106 record, with a 3.10 ERA and 893 strikeouts. Between 1969 and 1972, Peterson was one of the most successful left handed pitchers in baseball; only Mike Cuellar, Mickey Lolich and Dave McNally won more games in the American League than Peterson did during those four years. He is ninth on the Yankees All-Time Games Started list, and tenth on the All-Time Yankees Innings Pitched list.\n\nPeterson never played in a post-season game with the Yankees. “Mediocre at best,” Peterson said of the Yankee teams that followed the Mantle-Maris era of the mid to late 1960's. “Pathetic at worst.”\n\nHe was named to the 1970 AL All-Star team. The American League team was leading 4–1 in the bottom of the ninth inning when Catfish Hunter gave up a Home Run and two singles. With runners at first and second, Peterson was called in by AL Manager Earl Weaver to replace Hunter. Future Hall of Famer Willie McCovey singled tor right, driving in Bud Harrelson, with future HOF'er Joe Morgan moving to third. Fellow Yankee Stottlemyre then replaced Peterson.\n\nPeterson is probably best remembered today for swapping wives and children with fellow Yankee pitcher Mike Kekich, an arrangement the pair announced at spring training in March 1973. The Peterson and Kekich families had been friends since 1969. Peterson and the former Susanne Kekich are still married, but the relationship between Kekich and Marilyn Peterson did not last very long. By June, the Yankees traded Kekich. “It’s a love story. It wasn’t anything dirty,” Peterson told a reporter in 2013. “I could not be happier with anybody in the world. ‘My girl' and I go out and party every night. We’re still on the honeymoon and it has been a real blessing.\"\n\nPeterson's pitching seemed to suffer in 1973 and 1974 after the swap, and he was roundly booed in nearly every American League ballpark afterwards. He was traded along with Steve Kline, Fred Beene and Tom Buskey by the Yankees to the Cleveland Indians for Chris Chambliss, Dick Tidrow and Cecil Upshaw on April 26, 1974. Peterson went 9–14 for the Indians in 1974, and 14–8 in 1975.\n\nPeterson wore #30 during the 1974 season, and switched to #16 in 1975 and 1976.\n\nAfter starting the 1976 season with an 0–3 record, Cleveland traded Peterson to the Texas Rangers on May 28 for Stan Perzanowski and cash. He started two games for the Rangers and had a 1–0 record when a shoulder injury ended his season. The Rangers released him on February 2, 1977. Two weeks later, he signed as a Free Agent with the Chicago White Sox. After his second shoulder surgery, Peterson announced his retirement from baseball on May 4, 1977.\n\nPeterson provided color commentary for the New York Raiders of the World Hockey Association during the 1972–73 season. Later, Peterson and Susanne Kekich lived outside Chicago, where he worked as a blackjack dealer at the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Illinois. Peterson is also notable for his appearances in Jim Bouton's bestselling 1970 non-fiction book \"Ball Four\", where he is generally portrayed as one of the few major leaguers and former Yankees who had a positive view of Bouton.\n\nFritz Peterson released his first book, \"Mickey Mantle Is Going to Heaven\" in July 2009. Eventually, Peterson says, \"he plans to meet Mantle there and talk about old times.\" Sports author Maury Allen is quoted as saying, \"Fritz's book is even better than Bouton's \"Ball Four\".\"\n\nHe is the author of \"The Art of De-Conditioning: Eating Your Way to Heaven\", where he writes about his decision to \"accept his own eating habits and no longer worry about his weight affecting him on the field.\"\n\nHis third book, \"When the Yankees Were on the Fritz: Revisiting the Horace Clarke Era\", looks at a low-point in Yankee history when the team could not win a pennant despite the pitching combination of Peterson and Stottlemyre.\n\nPeterson is a cancer survivor, having battled prostate cancer twice. He is an \"intensively religious\" man, an \"evangelical Christian who used to work with Baseball Chapel.\"\n\nA known practical joker, Peterson was reportedly popular with this teammates, entertaining them with his elaborate jokes. He once used fake Baseball Hall of Fame letterhead to ask Moose Skowron to donate his pacemaker after he died, and used fake Yankees letterhead to ask Clete Boyer to participate in an \"official drinking contest\" against Don Larsen and Graig Nettles.\n\nPeterson is a regular attendee at the Yankees Fantasy Camp in Florida, and the Yankees Old-Timers' Day game at Yankee Stadium.\n\nOn July 23, 2018, Peterson announced on his Facebook page that he was diagnosed \"with Alzheimer's several months ago after falling apart very quickly.\"\n\nAs of 2015, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were developing a movie based on Peterson and Kekich, and owned the rights to \"The Trade,\" based on a book by Allen. Jay Roach was attached as director. Peterson will serve as a consultant to Warner Bros.\n\n"}

Aside from electrospray ionization in mass spectrometry, the Taylor cone is important in field-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) and colloid thrusters used in fine control and high efficiency (low power) thrust of spacecraft.\n\nThis cone was described by Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor in 1964 before electrospray was \"discovered\". This work followed on the work of Zeleny who photographed a cone-jet of glycerine in a strong electric field and the work of several others: Wilson and Taylor (1925), Nolan (1926) and Macky (1931). Taylor was primarily interested in the behavior of water droplets in strong electric fields, such as in thunderstorms.\n\nWhen a small volume of electrically conductive liquid is exposed to an electric field, the shape of liquid starts to deform from the shape caused by surface tension alone. As the voltage is increased the effect of the electric field becomes more prominent. As this effect of the electric field begins to exert a similar magnitude of force on the droplet as the surface tension does, a cone shape begins to form with convex sides and a rounded tip. This approaches the shape of a cone with a whole angle (width) of 98.6°. When a certain threshold voltage has been reached the slightly rounded tip inverts and emits a jet of liquid. This is called a cone-jet and is the beginning of the electrospraying process in which ions may be transferred to the gas phase. It is generally found that in order to achieve a stable cone-jet a slightly higher than threshold voltage must be used. As the voltage is increased even more, other modes of droplet disintegration are found. The term Taylor cone can specifically refer to the theoretical limit of a perfect cone of exactly the predicted angle or generally refer to the approximately conical portion of a cone-jet after the electrospraying process has begun.\n\nSir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor in 1964 described this phenomenon, theoretically derived based on general assumptions that the requirements to form a perfect cone under such conditions required a semi-vertical angle of 49.3° (a whole angle of 98.6°) and demonstrated that the shape of such a cone approached the theoretical shape just before jet formation. This angle is known as the Taylor angle. This angle is more precisely formula_1 where formula_2 is the first zero of formula_3 (the Legendre polynomial of order 1/2).\n\nTaylor's derivation is based on two assumptions: (1) that the surface of the cone is an equipotential surface and (2) that the cone exists in a steady state equilibrium. To meet both of these criteria the electric field must have azimuthal symmetry and have formula_4 dependence to counter the surface tension to produce the cone. The solution to this problem is:\n\nwhere formula_6 (equipotential surface) exists at a value of formula_7 (regardless of R) producing an equipotential cone. The angle necessary for formula_6 for all R is a zero of formula_3 between 0 and formula_10 which there is only one at 130.7099°. The complement of this angle is the Taylor angle.\n"}

As an example, someone could use blackmail to induce a contractor into breaking a contract, or they could obstruct someone's ability to honor a contract with a client by deliberately refusing to deliver necessary goods.\n\nA tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's negligence damages the contractual or business relationship between others, causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout that prevents the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.\n\nTortious interference with contract rights can occur when one party convinces another to breach its contract with a third party (e.g., using blackmail, threats, influence, etc.) or where someone knowingly interferes with a contractor's ability to perform his contractual obligations, preventing the client from receiving the services or goods promised (e.g., by refusing to deliver goods). The tortfeasor is the person who interferes with the contractual relationship between others. When a tortfeasor is aware of an existing contract and deliberately induces a breach by one of the contract holders, it is termed, \"tortious inducement of breach of contract\".\n\nTortious interference with business relationships occurs where the tortfeasor intentionally acts to prevent someone from successfully establishing or maintaining business relationships with others. This tort may occur when one party knowingly takes an action that causes a second party not to enter into a business relationship with a third party that otherwise would probably have occurred. An example is when a tortfeasor offers to sell a property to someone below market value knowing they were in the final stages of a sale with a third party pending the upcoming settlement date to formalize the sale writing. Such conduct is termed \"tortious interference with a business expectancy\".\n\nThe above situation are actionable only if someone with actual knowledge of, and intent to interfere with, an existing contract or expectancy between other parties, acts improperly with malicious intent and actually interferes with the contract/expectancy, causing economic harm. Historically, there has not been actionable cause if the interference was merely . However, for some jurisdictions recognize such claims, although many do not. A tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's negligence damages the contractual or business relationship between others causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout preventing the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.\n\nAn early, perhaps the earliest, instance of recognition of this tort occurred in \"Garret v Taylor\", 79 Eng. Rep. 485 (K.B. 1620). In that case, the defendant drove customers away from the plaintiff's quarry by threatening them with mayhem and also threatening to “vex [them] with suits.” The King's Bench court said that “the defendant threatened violence to the extent of committing an assault upon ... customers of the plaintiff ... whereupon ‘they all desisted from buying.’’ The court therefore upheld a judgment for the plaintiff.\n\nIn a similar case, \"Tarleton v McGawley\", 170 Eng. Rep. 153 (K.B. 1793), the defendant shot from its ship, \"Othello\", off the coast of Africa upon natives while “contriving and maliciously intending to hinder and deter the natives from trading with” plaintiff's rival trading ship, \"Bannister\". This action caused the natives (plaintiff's prospective customers) to flee the scene, depriving the plaintiff of their potential business. The King's Bench court held the conduct actionable. The defendant claimed, by way of justification, that the local native ruler had given it an exclusive franchise to trade with his subjects, but the court rejected this defense.\n\nThe tort was described in the case of \"Keeble v Hickeringill\", (1707) 103 Eng. Rep. 1127, styled as a \"trespass on the case\". In that case, the defendant had used a shotgun to drive ducks away from a pond that the plaintiff had built for the purpose of capturing ducks. Thus, unlike the foregoing cases, here the actionable conduct was not directly driving the prospective customers away, but rather eliminating the subject matter of the prospective business. Although the ducks had not yet been captured, the Justice Holt wrote for the court that \"where a violent or malicious act is done to a man's occupation, profession, or way of getting a livelihood, there an action lies in all cases.\" The court noted that the defendant would have the right to draw away ducks to a pond of his own, raising as a comparison a 1410 case in which the court deemed that no cause of action would lie where a schoolmaster opened a new school that drew students away from an old school.\n\nThe application of the above has since been modified in UK law. In \"OBG v Allan\" [2008] 1 AC 1.\nWrongful interference: the unified theory which treated causing loss by unlawful means as an extension of the tort of inducing a breach of contract was abandoned; inducing breach of contract and causing loss by unlawful means were two separate torts.\ninducing a breach of contract was a tort of accessory liability, and an intention to cause a breach of contract was a necessary and sufficient requirement for liability; a person had to know that he was inducing a breach of contract and to intend to do; that a conscious decision not to inquire into the existence of a fact could be treated as knowledge for the purposes of the tort; that a person who knowingly induced a breach of contract as a means to an end had the necessary intent even if he was not motivated by malice but had acted with the motive of securing an economic advantage for himself; that, however, a breach of contract which was neither an end in itself nor a means to an end but was merely a foreseeable consequence of a person's acts did not give rise to liability; and that there could be no secondary liability without primary liability, and therefore a person could not be liable for inducing a breach of contract unless there had in fact been a breach by the contracting party.\n\nCausing loss by unlawful means: acts against a third party counted as unlawful means only if they were actionable by that third party if he had suffered loss; that unlawful means consisted of acts intended to cause loss to the claimant by interfering with the freedom of a third party in a way which was unlawful as against that third party and which was intended to cause loss to the claimant, but did not include acts which might be unlawful against a third party but which did not affect his freedom to deal with the claimant. Strict liability for conversion applied only to an interest in chattels and not to chooses in action; this was too radical to impose liability for pure economic loss on receivers who had been appointed and had acted in good faith. This also left open the position where they breached the duty of good faith.\n\n\nAlthough the specific elements required to prove a claim of tortious interference vary from one jurisdiction to another, they typically include the following:\n\n\nThe first element may, in employment-at-will jurisdictions, be held fulfilled in regards to a previously unterminated employer/employee relationship.\n\nIn California, these are the elements of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, which the plaintiff must establish:\n\n\nSome cases add that a defendant acts negligently only if \"the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.\"\n\nCalifornia and most jurisdictions hold that there is a privilege to compete for business. “Under the privilege of free competition, a competitor is free to divert business to himself as long as he uses fair and reasonable means. Thus, the plaintiff must present facts indicating the defendant’s interference is somehow wrongful—i.e., based on facts that take the defendant’s actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.” \"[T]he competition privilege is defeated only where the defendant engages in unlawful or illegitimate means.\" \"\n\"Wrongful\" in this context means “independently wrongful”—that is, \"blameworthy\" or \" independently wrongful apart from the interference itself.\" This may be termed use of improper means. “Commonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, trade libel or trade mark infringement.” Other examples of \"wrongful conduct\" are \"fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation, coercion, obstruction or molestation of the rival or his servants or workmen.\"\n\nTypical legal damages for tortious interference include economic losses, if they can be proven with certainty, and mental distress. Additionally punitive damages may be awarded if malice on the part of the wrongdoer can be established.\n\nEquitable remedies may include injunctive relief in the form of a negative injunction that would be used to prevent the wrongdoer from benefiting from any contractual relationship that may arise out of the interference, i.e., the performance of a singer who was originally contracted with the plaintiff to perform at the same time.\n\nTortious interference with an expected inheritance - One who, by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received, is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.\n\n\n"}

The episodes for the top two athletes, Michael Jordan and Babe Ruth, appeared on a special combined edition broadcast on Christmas Day on ABC. The top two names were announced in no particular order, and the final positioning was announced at the conclusion of the two episodes. An additional list of numbers 51-100 were announced on the ESPN \"SportsCentury\" website. Themed specials such as \"Greatest Games\", \"Greatest Coaches\", \"Greatest Dynasties\", and \"Most Influential Individuals\" were premiered throughout the year, as well as six \"SportsCenter of the Decade\" programs.\n\nAfter the initial run was complete, the episodes were rerun at various times on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Classic. The original plan for the series was to expand to include #51 through #100. Ultimately, the series featured just over half of the athletes from #51 to #100, and instead expanded to include over 150 other athletes, coaches, owners, personalities, and notable moments in sports history. Acknowledgements were given to athletes that were notable for more recent accomplishments, even if they spent only a small part of their career in the 20th century (e.g., Tiger Woods, Tom Brady), or were recently deceased (e.g. Pat Tillman, Dale Earnhardt). Special subsets of episodes were created revolving around a particular event, including athletes associated with the particular sport. They would typically air in the days leading up to those events. (e.g., Winter Olympics, golf majors, Indianapolis 500, etc.)\n\nESPN Classic began to feature the program with host, Chris Fowler, as the highlight of its weeknight prime-time programing, airing five nights a week. After cycling through the entire series several times, and after debuting several new episodes, it was removed as a nightly program. , reruns of the documentary series airs Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. Eastern time. The last original program was that of Shaquille O'Neal, which aired in November 2007.\n\nThe final order of choices led to debate, some of which came from the \"SportsCentury\" camp. Bob Costas, one of the series' voters, said, \"I had Babe Ruth as my number one, but I think the list they came up with was a good one. Everybody more or less deserved to be there.\" ESPN writer Bud Morgan conceded that the Secretariat pick \"was kind of controversial because a lot of people took the attitude 'What is a four-legged animal doing on this list?'\"\n\nTony Kornheiser, whose ballot was topped by Ruth, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, said, \"I can't conceive of how Ruth didn't finish number one. He had the greatest impact of anybody on a sport by far... Michael Jordan didn't have as many championships as Bill Russell and didn't score as many points as Wilt Chamberlain, and really didn't do anything to advance his sport, so maybe in retrospect I upgraded him a bit too much because the way he performed was so spectacular, and because of television I got to see highlights. They may have overpersuaded a lot of us... Did Jim Thorpe get the praise he deserved? Probably not, because there weren't enough people old enough to really remember him.\"\n\nESPN anchor Charley Steiner said \"I think picking [Jordan] number one was a generational decision, not a historical one. Babe Ruth deserved it more.\"\n\nSportsCentury won a Peabody Award in 1999 \"for overall excellence in sports broadcasting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Greatest Games\" was a top ten countdown of the best games/matches voted on from a wide variety of team and individual sports.\n\n\"Greatest Coaches\" was a top ten countdown of the best coaches voted on from a wide variety of team sports\n\n\nAnother top ten countdown special, focusing on influential figures in sports during the twentieth century, namely off-the-field contributors.\n\n\n\n\nAlso included in the overall production was \"SportsCenter of the Decade\", a series of six two-hour programs (1900-1949, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s).

His father was elected as US senator in 1910. As an attorney and planter with 20,000 acres under cultivation for cotton, he was very influential at the Episcopal university, in Sewanee, Tennessee, a postbellum tradition in his family.\n\nHe spent a year in Paris before going to Harvard for a law degree. After returning to Greenville, Percy joined his father's firm in the practice of law.\n\nDuring World War I, Percy joined the Commission for Relief in Belgium in November 1916. He served in Belgium as a delegate until the withdrawal of American personnel upon the US declaration of war in April 1917. He served in the US Army in World War I, earning the rank of Captain and the \"Croix de Guerre\".\n\nFrom 1925 to 1932, Percy edited the \"Yale Younger Poets\" series, the first of its kind in the country. He also published four volumes of poetry with the Yale University Press. A Southern man of letters, Percy befriended many fellow writers, Southern, Northern and European, including William Faulkner. He socialized with Langston Hughes and other people in and about the Harlem Renaissance. Percy was a sort of godfather to the Fugitives at Vanderbilt, or Southern Agrarians, as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren were often called.\n\nPercy's family was plagued with suicides, including that of his first cousin LeRoy Pratt Percy and possibly his wife, Martha Susan (Mattie Sue) Phinizy Percy, who died in a car accident. William adopted his cousin's children, Walker, LeRoy (Roy) and Phinizy (Phin) Percy, after they were orphaned. As adults, all three prospered. Walker became a medical doctor and a best-selling author. Roy married Sarah Hunt Farish, the daughter of Will Percy's law partner, Hazlewood Power Farish. He took charge of the Percy family plantation, Trail Lake. Phin married and moved to New Orleans to practice law.\n\nPercy's most well-known work is his memoir, \"Lanterns on the Levee: Recollections of a Planter's Son\" (Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1941). His other works include the text of \"They Cast Their Nets in Galilee,\" which is included in the \"Episcopal Hymnal\" (1982) (Hymn 661), and the \"Collected Poems\" (Knopf 1943). One of his pieces was published under the name A. W. Percy in \"Men and Boys\", an anonymous anthology of Uranian poetry (New York, 1934).\n\nPercy was the playwright behind a one-act scene in a volume of poetry, \"In April Once\" (1920).\n\nA friend of Herbert Hoover from the Belgium Relief Effort during the early years of World War I, Percy was put in charge of relief during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when an area larger than all New England minus Maine was flooded in the spring. During the flood, thousands of blacks, fleeing farms and plantations under water, sought refuge on the levee in Greenville. Percy believed that the refugees needed to be evacuated to Vicksburg to receive better care and food, and he arranged for ships to prepare to remove them.\n\n\n"}

Again!) is a British sitcom and a spin-off of \"Are You Being Served?\" that aired on BBC1 for two series from 1992 to 1993 and marked the return of \"Are You Being Served?\" creators and writers Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft.\n\nThe idea of a spin-off was suggested by the cast of \"Are You Being Served?\" almost immediately after the original series ended in 1985. Lloyd and Croft liked the idea, but agreed that the department store format was exhausted and that any spin-off would require a change of location. Despite the enthusiasm of the original cast, it was almost seven years before Lloyd and Croft brought them back to television.\n\nThe plot line that brought the cast from the store to the manor was considered remarkably topical, since it aired just a few months after the death of British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, who was revealed to have borrowed heavily against his own employees' pensions.\n\n\"Grace and Favour\" is different from \"Are You Being Served?\" in that it involves a continuous story arc, with certain plot elements, such as the relationship between Mr Humphries and Mavis Moulterd, unfolding throughout each episode. This in turn allowed the series to involve more complex storylines and subplots, making it possible to include returning guest stars and location shooting, neither of which was ever done on \"Are You Being Served?\"\n\nThe title of the series is a double play on words. A \"grace and favour\" is a home or other property owned by a monarch but given to the use of a faithful retainer upon his retirement, as with the retired characters in this series. Grace is also the surname of the owner of Grace Brothers, the fictional department store where the characters previously worked and was also the previous owner of Millstone Manor.\n\nIn the United States the show was broadcast on PBS as \"Are You Being Served? Again!\" in 1992. In Australia the show was broadcast on Network Ten in 1994.\n\n\"Are You Being Served?\" cast member Mike Berry (Mr Spooner) chose not to return. Arthur English (Mr Harman) was also not brought in due to his retirement. Wendy Richard took time off from filming for \"EastEnders\" to film. Also returning to their roles were John Inman, who played menswear assistant Mr Humphries; Mollie Sugden, as former head of ladieswear Mrs Slocombe; Frank Thornton, who played the floorwalker Captain Peacock; and Nicholas Smith as the former head of the department, Cuthbert Rumbold. These were also the only five actors to have appeared in every episode of \"Are You Being Served?\"\n\nOther cast members, such as Trevor Bannister (Mr Lucas), Milo Sperber (Mr Grossman), Benny Lee (Mr Klein) and Larry Martyn (Mr Mash), were not asked to reprise their roles.\n\nSeveral new recurring characters were added to the show. Joanne Heywood as Miss Lovelock, Billy Burden as farmer Morris Moulterd, and Fleur Bennett as his daughter, Mavis, appeared in all 12 episodes. Michael Bilton, as Mr Grace's solicitor, Mr Thorpe, and his assistant, Miss Prescott, played by Shirley Cheriton, also played key roles in both series.\n\n\nThe new series has the elderly and womanising \"Young Mr Grace\", head of Grace Brothers department store, recently deceased while scuba-diving on holiday in the Caribbean with his personal secretary, Miss Jessica Lovelock. As per the instructions in his will, the remaining workers in each department at Grace Brothers' closing sale find their pensions invested in different things. The members of the Men's and Ladies' Departments, along with Ms Lovelock, inherit the estate that is the locale of the show.\nYoung Mr Grace had invested their pension funds in a multitude of antiquated businesses, the largest of which is a country manor house called Millstone Manor. The will stipulates that they cannot sell the house and split the profits, but can use the property in the manner of their choosing. After a trip to Millstone Manor to view the property, where they also learn their pensions are minuscule, they decide to live in the manor in order to run it as an inn and live off the proceeds. Miss Lovelock, given accommodation in the grooms' quarters and charge of the horses, also lives at the manor much to the distress of Mrs Slocombe and Miss Brahms. Captain Peacock is not so bothered, however.\n\nThe series begins just after the funeral of Mr Grace, and quickly brings the cast to Millstone Manor. There they find Mr Rumbold having trouble trying to find new staff after telling the previous staff \"in no uncertain terms\" that if they did not straighten up they could leaveand they left. With time running out, the old Grace Brothers employees are obliged to \"stand in\" for the staff in order to have their picture taken as the inn staff for a travel brochure. Soon they find that they are running the inn themselves with the help of Mr Moulterd, who manages the manor's farm, and his daughter Mavis, who helps out at the manor.\n\nWith Mr Humphries forced by circumstance to share a bed with Mavis, he finds that she develops a bit of a crush on him. This series of events leads all of the cast to assume they are having an affair, which flatters Mr Humphries, though he denies any such goings-on. Despite these events, Mr Humphries continues to be rather ambivalent to the idea of a relationship with anyone. A young man from the village vies with Humphries for Mavis' affection, and frequently attempts to intimidate him by threatening him with violence.\n\nOn her first day in the country, Mrs Slocombe tries to move a gypsy's wagon that blocked the road and ends up charged with wagon theft, narrowly avoiding a charge of indecent exposure since there was \"just a flash\" as the out-of-control wagon raced past the post office. At her trial, all of her colleagues are called as witnesses, but it is Mr Moulterd who ends up winning the case for her. Mrs Slocombe is grateful, despite her irritation that he brings up their sexual relationship during the War, which she insists never happened. Also notable is the unexpected appearance of the oft alluded to, but never-before-seen Mr Slocombe, from whom Mrs Slocombe seeks to hide her identity.\n\nOther events include the staff putting on a traditional harvest festival dance for octogenarian American visitors and putting on a showcase of British arts and culture for a tour group from Mongolia.\n\nEpisode 1 of Series 2 contains a number of satirical references to the wrongful conviction and hanging of Derek Bentley for the murder of a policeman. The case revolved around the issue of whether Bentley's words \"Let him have it, Chris\" to his associate Christopher Craig were meant literally (\"Let him have the gun\") or figuratively (\"Open fire!\"). The case had been widely publicised and was the subject of a film titled \"Let Him Have It\" starring Christopher Eccleston a few years before the show was made.\n\nAll regions released contain both series of \"Grace & Favour\" in one set.\nAll external filming for the series was undertaken in and around Tetbury in Gloucestershire. Primary filming was at Chavenage House, which was used for Millstone Manor, just outside Tetbury.\n\n"}

The pageant was conceived by Metromedia Singapore and Procon Leisure International.\n\nManhunt International wears the crown as the World’s first and without doubt the most prestigious of all pageants & competitions for men. It started life in 1988 when Alex Liu, pageant director of Metromedia Singapore, decided to stage the first male model contest in Singapore announcing a “Manhunt.”\n\nIt became Manhunt International in 1993 when Rosko Dickinson (Australia) and Alex Liu (Singapore) joined forces with a dream to offer the men of the World a platform to showcase their talents. The first ever Manhunt International World Final was held in Australia in 1993 with 25 contestants. In 1994, the pageant remained in Australia's Gold Coast when Nikos Papadakis of Greece won. Rosko Dickinson & Alex Liu remained Co-owners and partners of Manhunt International for 25 years until Alex Liu died in January 2018.\n\nManhunt International is organized in a macho way with outdoor activities, thrilling events, public presentations, talent competition, fun routines, and even a chance to meet and impress ladies. Contestants are judged on their catwalk and runway skills, photogenic ability, personality, and physical attributes.\n\nManhunt International is organized to promote new faces for the male modeling and fashion industry. The men that enter Manhunt International are also encouraged to become role models and good corporate citizens for younger people to look up to. \n\nToday, Manhunt International is easily the World's most recognised and longest running international male model contest. It is the worldwide search for the best male models with the highest number contestants happening in 2006 (held in Jinjiang, China) and in 2012 (held in Bangkok, Thailand)\n\nSeveral countries have hosted this international male model pageant including—Australia (1993, 1994, 1998), Singapore (1995, 1997, 2000), Philippines (1999), China (2001, 2002, 2006, 2016), Korea (2005, 2007, 2008, 2011), Taiwan (2010), and Thailand (2012, 2017).\n\nWinners have come from many different countries, namely, Germany (1993), Greece (1994) South Africa (1995), New Zealand (1997), Sweden (1998 & 2016), Venezuela (1999), Australia (2000), India (2001), France (2002), Turkey (2005), USA (2006), China (2007 & 2011), Morocco (2008), Slovak Republic (2010), Philippines (2012), Vietnam (2017), and Spain (2018).\n\nThe Manhunt competition is staged in two rounds, preliminary and final. During the preliminary round, the contestants are judged in national costume, swimwear, evening wear and fashion wear. The contestants with highest scores are named as finalists, from which the judges determine the winner and the runners up.\n\nDuring the pageant final, several other awards also given beside the ultimate title of Manhunt International: Best in National Costume, Best Runway Model, Mister Photogenic, Mister Friendship, Mister Personality, Mister Physique and Mister Popularity (voted by the public via social media).

It consists of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marines Reserve and Naval Careers Service. The term Naval Service should be distinguished from the \"UK Naval Services\", which consist of the Naval Service and the Merchant Navy. The Naval Service as a whole falls under the command of the Navy Board, which is headed by the First Sea Lord. This position is currently held by Admiral Tony Radakin (appointed June 2019). The Defence Council delegates administration of the Naval Service to the Admiralty Board, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence.\n\nThe Naval Service is dominated by the Royal Navy, and operates primarily from three bases in the United Kingdom where commissioned ships are based; Portsmouth, Clyde and Devonport, the last being the largest operational naval base in Western Europe. As of 2019, there are over 184 vessels in service with the various branches of the Naval Service and supporting organisations, including; 75 commissioned ships of the Royal Navy, 33 landing craft of the Royal Marines, 63 auxiliary vessels of Marine Services and 13 auxiliary ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. As of March 2019, Her Majesty's Naval Service employed a total of 40,600 personnel.\n\nThe total displacement of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is as of December 2019 in excess of 815,200 tonnes.\n\nAccording to the \"Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy\" the Naval Service consists of:\n\nThe Naval Service is also supported by Marine Services (currently provided under a private finance initiative) and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary which both operate a fleet of auxiliaries in support of the Royal Navy. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary is considered part of the Ministry of Defence Civil Service.\n\nThe following services were formerly also components of the Naval Service:\n\nNaval Reserve Forces:\n\nFormerly the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service, the Fleet Reserve, and the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors were also considered part of the Naval Service.\n\nReferred to as the \"Senior Service\" by virtue of it being the oldest service within the British Armed Forces, the Royal Navy is a technologically sophisticated naval force and forms the core structure of the Naval Service. Command of deployable assets is exercised by the Fleet Commander. The United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent is carried aboard the navy's of four nuclear ballistic-missile submarines. The surface fleet consists of destroyers, frigates, amphibious assault ships, patrol ships, mine-countermeasures, and miscellaneous vessels. The submarine service has existed within the Royal Navy for more than 100 years. The service possessed a combined fleet of diesel-electric and nuclear-powered submarines until the early 1990s. Following the Options for Change defence review, the \"Upholder\"-class diesel-electric submarines were withdrawn and the attack submarine flotilla is now exclusively nuclear-powered.\n\nThe infantry component of the Naval Service is the Corps of Royal Marines. Consisting of a single manoeuvre brigade (3 Commando Brigade) and various independent units, the Royal Marines specialise in amphibious, arctic, and mountain warfare. Contained within 3 Commando Brigade are three attached army units; 1st Battalion, The Rifles, an infantry battalion based at Beachley Barracks near Chepstow (from April 2008), 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, an artillery regiment based in Plymouth, and 24 Commando Regiment Royal Engineers. The Commando Logistic Regiment consists of personnel from the Army, Royal Marines, and Royal Navy.\n\nThe Naval Careers Service is the recruiting arm of the Naval Service. It is manned by former Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel who are typically based at Armed Forces Careers Offices. It is the smallest component of the Naval Service comprising fewer than 200 personnel.\n\nThe Royal Fleet Auxiliary is a civilian-manned fleet owned by the British Ministry of Defence. The RFA enables ships of the Royal Navy to maintain operations around the world. Its primary role is to supply the Royal Navy with fuel, ammunition and supplies, normally by replenishment at sea (RAS). It also transports Army and Royal Marine personnel, as well as supporting training exercises. RFA personnel are members of the Ministry of Defence civil service who wear Merchant Navy rank insignia with naval uniforms and are under naval discipline when the vessel is engaged on warlike operations. RFA vessels are commanded and crewed by these civilians, augmented with regular and reserve Royal Navy personnel to perform specialised military functions such as operating and maintaining helicopters or providing hospital facilities. The RFA is funded out of the UK defence budget and the Commodore commanding the RFA is directly responsible to the Royal Navy Fleet Commander.\n\nThe Royal Fleet Auxiliary also augments the Royal Navy's amphibious warfare capabilities through its three vessels. The service is manned by around 1,850 civilian personnel.\n\nMarine Services enables Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary Ships, including the United Kingdom's Strategic Nuclear Deterrent, to either move in or out of port for operational deployment and training exercises around the world. The service operates a large assortment of vessels including tugs and pilot boats as well as transporting stores, liquid and munitions and providing passenger transfer services to and from ships for officers and crew. Serco Denholm took over Marine Services to the Naval Service from the now disbanded Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service in 2008. In late 2009 Serco bought out Denholm's share, with the service now being known as Serco Marine Services.\n\nSee the articles below for lists of vessels operated by or in support of Her Majesty's Naval Service:\n\n\n"}

Written and composed by its lead singer, Ray Dorset, it celebrates the carefree days of summer. In 1970, it reached number one in charts around the world, including seven weeks on the UK Singles Chart, two weeks on one of the Canadian charts, and number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart in the US. It became one of the best-selling singles of all-time, eventually selling 30 million copies.\n\nDorset has said that the song only took ten minutes to write, which he did using a second-hand Fender Stratocaster while he was taking time off from his regular job, working in a lab for Timex.\n\nThe initial UK release was on Dawn Records, a new label launched by Pye. It was unusual in that it was a maxi single, playing at 33-1/3 rpm, whereas singles generally played at 45 rpm. It included an additional song also written and composed by Dorset, \"Mighty Man,\" on the A-side, and a much longer track, the Woody Guthrie song \"Dust Pneumonia Blues,\" on the B-side. As the record was sold in a picture sleeve, also not standard at the time, and only sold at a few pence more than the normal 45 rpm two-track single, it was considered value for money. A small quantity of 45 rpm discs on the Pye record label, with \"Mighty Man\" on the B-side, and without a picture sleeve, were pressed for use in jukeboxes. These are now rare collector's items.\n\nIn 2012, Dorset sued his former management company Associated Music International, run by his former friend and business manager Eliot Cohen, claiming over £2 million in royalties from the song that he believed had been withheld from him.\n\nIn an interview with Gary James, Dorset explained the origin of the \"motorcycle\" sound towards the false ending in the middle of the song: \"I said, 'We'll just get a recording of a motorcycle, stick it on the end of the song and then re-edit the front and then put the front off to the motorcycle so it starts up again.' But I couldn't find a motorcycle. Howard Barry, the engineer had an old, well, it wasn't old then, a Triumph sports car, which he drove past the studio while Barry Marrit was holding the microphone. So, he got the stereo effects from left to right or right to left, whatever. And that was it.\"\n\nCredits adapted from the single liner notes for \"In the Summertime\".\n\nIn 1995, Jamaican-American rapper Shaggy covered the song, and released it as the lead single from his third studio album, \"Boombastic\". Aside from the addition of rap lyrics, Shaggy's version also substitutes other lyrics for the song's original line containing \"have a drink, have a drive.\" Shaggy also performed the song on an episode of \"Baywatch\". A year after its release, the song was re-recorded and released specifically for the film \"Flipper\" under the title \"In the Summertime\" ('96 Version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe song's lyric \"have a drink, have a drive, go out and see what you can find\" led to its use in a UK advert for the campaign Drinking and Driving Wrecks Lives. It featured the first verse against people enjoying drinks in a pub during summer, then stopped to show a fatal car accident caused by drink driving.\n\n\n"}

He was the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States, serving more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. He was succeeded by Cathie Black in January 2011.\n\n\"New York\" magazine ranked Klein as one of the most influential people in public education. Klein had never obtained the common formal credentials that one would have to take a leadership role in a public school system, and Klein had a short duration of teaching experience.\n\nKlein grew up in New York City and attended public schools, graduating from William Cullen Bryant High School in Queens in 1963. He attended Columbia University, graduating \"magna cum laude\" and Phi Beta Kappa. He received his law degree from Harvard Law School, again graduating \"magna cum laude\", in 1971. He then clerked for Chief Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1973 until 1974, before then clerking for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.\n\nIn 1975, Klein joined the legal team of the Washington, DC, non-profit Mental Health Law Project. The MHLP was an independent non-profit organization that brought class-action suits to establish rights for mentally and developmentally disabled clients. In that capacity, Klein specialized in constitutional and health-care. After working there for a year, he went into private practice, working for five years before founding a law firm with several partners. In the 1990s, Klein served in the White House Counsel's office under President Bill Clinton, before being appointed to the United States Department of Justice. There, he was appointed United States Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, and in this capacity he was the lead prosecutor in the antitrust case \"United States v. Microsoft\".\nPrior to his appointment to chancellor in 2002 by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Klein was counsel to Bertelsmann, an international media group.\n\nKlein was rumored to be one of Barack Obama's candidates for Secretary of Education. Ultimately, the position went to the chief executive officer of Chicago Public Schools, Arne Duncan, then to New York State Education Commissioner John King Jr.\n\nIn 1998, before Klein became Chancellor, the New York City Board of Education transferred responsibility for school safety to the New York City Police Department. Klein has been criticized for not seeking to alter this arrangement or to curb the conduct of the Police Department's school safety agents in the face of allegations of abuse. Klein has praised the work of the school-safety agents in contributing to a decrease in crime in the public schools.\n\nDespite their opposing positions in the Justice Department antitrust case against Microsoft, Klein was able to work with the Gates Foundation to fund the creation of smaller schools in New York City. At the 43 small high schools funded by the Gates Foundation graduation rates are 73% compared to 53% at the schools they replaced. The researchers only examined schools selectively; for example, 33 small schools were omitted from the analysis. According to Bob Herbert, Bill Gates later admitted that the idea of breaking up schools was a failure.\n\nIn 2004, a controversy beset Klein's administration, as two members of his staff -- deputy chancellor Diana Lam and lawyer Chad Vignola -- both resigned amid accusations of nepotism; she was accused of helping her husband gain employment in the system without following conflicts of interest procedures, and Vignola was accused of trying to cover it up. A report by Schools Investigator Richard Condon found Lam helped her husband get two jobs improperly, and criticized Vignola for falsely claiming that the husband was a volunteer rather than a hired employee.\n\nIn 2005, Klein fired Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi from the teacher training program, reportedly because of Khalidi's political views. After the controversial decision, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: \"The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts.\" The program's creator Mark Willner stated that (Khalidi) \"spoke on geography and demography,\" and that \"There was nothing controversial, nothing political.\"\n\nIn 2007, Klein installed a computer system called The Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS), at a cost of $95 million, with records on 1 million current and former students. Teachers and parents were able to track student progress with the system. After Klein left his job as chancellor to work at the News Corp., a company owned by the News Corp. got a contract for nearly $10 million to manage the system in 2012. Subsequent News Corp. contracts were worth millions more. Klein denied a conflict of interest. Finally, in 2014, the Education Department decided to abandon the system, due to its high cost, limited functionality, and little use by parents and staff.\n\nOn November 9, 2010, Bloomberg announced that Klein would resign as chancellor and would take a position as an executive vice president for News Corporation. Klein's date of departure was not immediately clear but it was later announced that he would be gone at the end of the year. He was replaced by Cathie Black, chairman of Hearst Magazines and former president of \"USA Today\", on January 3, 2011.\n\nOn July 6, 2011, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation and the company's CEO, announced that Joel Klein would \"provide important oversight and guidance\" in the internal investigation of phone hacking at \"News of the World\". Klein and fellow director Viet D. Dinh took over the investigation from News International UK Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks, whose own involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator.\n\nSince joining News Corp, Klein has recruited at least two other executives from the New York City Department of Education. In February 2011, NYCDoE Communications Director Natalie Ravitz announced that she would be joining News Corp as Klein's chief of staff. According to GothamSchools, a nonprofit, non-partisan news website that reports on the New York City schools, \"Ravitz is following a well-worn path from the department to NewsCorp: Ex-schools chief Joel Klein, who was chancellor when Ravitz was hired, now heads the company's growing education division. Last summer, Klein picked Kristen Kane, the department's former chief operating officer, to become the division's COO. He also acquired Wireless Generation, the technology company that developed and managed ARIS, the city's school data warehouse.\"\n\nIn 2016, Klein became a “top executive” with New York health insurance start-up Oscar, which has a focus on technology.\n\nKlein is married to Nicole Seligman, general counsel to Howard Stringer of Sony Corp. Seligman was on the legal team of then-President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate.\n\n"}

It has survived from the 1970s until today in various forms and presentations. It has slowly evolved into a concept that recognises and accepts large scale plate motions such as envisaged by plate tectonics, but placing them in a framework where large mantle plumes are the major driving force of the system.\nThe initial followers of the concept during the first half of the 20th Century are scientists like Beloussov and van Bemmelen, and recently the concept has gained interest especially in Japan, through new compiled work on palaeomagnetism, and is still advocaded by the group of scientists elaboration upon Earth expansion. It is nowadays generally not accepted as the main theory to explain the driving forces of tectonic plate movements, although numerous modulations on the concept have been proposed.\n\nThe theory focuses on the movements of mantle plumes under tectonic plates, viewing them as the major driving force of movements of (parts of) the Earth's crust. In its more modern form, conceived in the 1970s, it tries to reconcile in one single geodynamic model the horizontalistic concept of Plate tectonics, and the verticalistic concepts of mantle plumes, by the gravitational movement of plates away from major domes of the Earth's crust. The existence of various supercontinents in Earth history and their break-up has been associated recently with major upwellings of the mantle.\n\nIt is classified together with mantle convection as one of the mechanism that are used to explain the movements of tectonic plates. It also shows affinity with the concept of hot spots which is used in modern-day plate teconics to generate a framework of specific mantle upwelling points that are relatively stable throughout time and are used to calibrate the plate movements using their location together with paleomagnetic data. Another affinity is the concept of surge tectonics which envisage flows through the mantle as major driving forces of Plate Tectonics.\n\n"}

In 1963 he was part of the breakaway group of Central staff and students who formed Drama Centre London. After several small parts as actor he began his collaboration with British television director Alan Clarke in 1981. Their film \"Made in Britain\" was critically acclaimed and marked the beginning of the career of actor Tim Roth. \"Made in Britain\" won the Prix Italia (an international Television award) in 1984. In 1986 he wrote the screenplay for the thriller-drama \"Mona Lisa\", featuring Bob Hoskins. This film was critically acclaimed and Leland earned nominations for the Golden Globe and the Writers Guild of America.\n\nHe then wrote \"Personal Services\" in 1986. It was directed by Terry Jones and was about Cynthia Payne, a real-life British madam who ran a private brothel. Julie Walters took the leading role. While \"Personal Services\" dealt with the adult life of Cynthia Payne, Leland's next film, \"Wish You Were Here\", concerned her teenage years. This film was a success at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and it made the young British actress Emily Lloyd a star. It was awarded the FIPRESCI-Award at Cannes and the BAFTA for best screenplay.\n\nIn 1991, Leland directed the very successful stage musical \"A Tribute to the Blues Brothers\", which played on the West End and then toured for ten years in the UK and Australia.\n\nLeland's next two films, \"Checking Out\" (with Jeff Daniels) and \"The Big Man\" (with Liam Neeson), failed at the box office and with the critics but have since been successful in the private market. In 1997, Leland co-wrote and directed \"The Land Girls\" starring Rachel Weisz and Anna Friel and, in 2000, wrote and directed Episode 6 of the enormously successful HBO Miniseries \"Band of Brothers\".\n\nIn 2012, Leland joined the Showtime series \"The Borgias\" as co-showrunner and executive producer (alongside Neil Jordan, whom he had worked with on 1986's \"Mona Lisa\"), writing the last five episodes of its second season and directing its last two episodes. He described his stint as co-showrunner and executive producer as a \"hands-on\" experience and having to commit to extensive research on the Renaissance.\n\nAfter the death of his friend George Harrison, Leland was closely involved in the former Beatle's memorial, Concert for George, and directed a cinematic documentary of the night to be put on general release, the DVD of which went platinum.

It was authorized by the United States Congress under the Internal Revenue Code, section 402A, and represents a unique combination of features of the Roth IRA and a traditional 401(k) plan. Since January 1, 2006, U.S. employers have been allowed to amend their 401(k) plan document to allow employees to elect Roth IRA type tax treatment for a portion or all of their retirement plan contributions. The same change in law allowed Roth IRA type contributions to 403(b) retirement plans. The Roth retirement plan provision was enacted as a provision of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA 2001).\n\nIn a traditional 401(k) plan, introduced by Congress in 1978, employees contribute pre-tax earnings to their retirement plan, also called \"elective deferrals\". That is, an employee's elective deferral funds are set aside by the employer in a special account where the funds are allowed to be invested in various options made available in the plan. The IRS sets a limit on the amount of funds deferred in this way, and includes a \"catch up\" provision intended to allow older workers to save for their approaching retirement. These limits are adjusted each year to reflect changes in the cost of living due to inflation. For tax-year 2019, this limit is $19,000 for those under age 50, and $25,000 for those 50 and over.(IRS)\n\nEmployers may also add funds to the account by contributing matching funds on a fractional formula basis (e.g., matching funds might be added at the rate of 50% of employees' elective deferrals), or on a set percentage basis. Funds within the 401(k) account grow on a tax deferred basis. When the account owner reaches the age of 59½, he or she may begin to receive \"qualified distributions\" from the funds in the account; these distributions are then taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Exceptions exist to allow distribution of funds before 59½, such as \"substantially equal periodic payments\", disability, and separation from service after the age of 55, as outlined under IRS Code section 72(t).\n\nUnder a Roth IRA, first enacted in 1998, individuals, whether employees or self-employed, voluntarily contribute \"post-tax\" funds to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA). In contrast to the 401(k) plan, the Roth plan requires post-tax contributions, but allows for tax free growth \"and distribution\", provided the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years \"and\" the account owner has reached age 59½. Roth IRA contribution limits are significantly lower than 401(k) contribution limits. For tax-years 2016 and 2017, individuals may contribute no more than $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA if under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older. And 2019 allows contributions up to $7,000 under age 50. Additionally, Roth IRA contribution limits are reduced for taxpayers with a Modified Adjusted Gross Income (modified AGI) greater than $117,000 ($184,000 for married filing jointly), phasing out entirely for individuals with a modified AGI of $132,000 ($194,000 for married filing jointly), for 2016. See 401(k) versus IRA matrix that compares various types of IRAs with various types of 401(k)s.\n\nThe Roth 401(k) combines some of the most advantageous aspects of both the 401(k) and the Roth IRA. Under the Roth 401(k), employees may contribute funds on a post-tax elective deferral basis, in addition to or instead of pre-tax elective deferrals under their traditional 401(k) plans. An employee's combined elective deferrals whether to a traditional 401(k), a Roth 401(k), or both cannot exceed the IRS limits for deferral of the traditional 401(k). Employers' matching funds are not included in the elective deferral cap\nbut are considered for the maximum section 415 limit, which is $53,000 for 2015 and 2016, or $59,000 for those age 50 and older. The higher section 415 limit also applies to after tax contributions, which, depending on the specific 401(k), might be convertible into a Roth 401(k) later.\n\nEmployers are permitted to make matching contributions on employees' designated Roth contributions. However, employers' contributions cannot receive the Roth tax treatment. The matching contributions made on account of designated Roth contributions must be allocated to a pre-tax account, just as matching contributions are on traditional, pre-tax elective contributions. (Pub 4530)\n\nIn general, the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) is that income contributed to the Roth version is taxable in the year it is earned, but income contributed to the traditional version is taxable in the year in which it is distributed from the account. Furthermore, earnings on the traditional version are taxable income in the year they are distributed, but earnings on the Roth version are never taxable.\n\nThere are restrictions on the nontaxability of Roth earnings: typically, the distribution must be made at least 5 years after the first Roth contribution and after the recipient is age 59 ½.\n\nA Roth 401(k) plan is probably most advantageous to those who might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets is the future of income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.\n\nAdoption of Roth 401(k) plans has been relatively slow, partly because they require additional administrative recordkeeping and payroll processing. However some larger firms have now adopted Roth 401(k) plans, which is expected to spur their adoption by other firms including smaller ones.\n\n\n\n"}

The city is located on the coast, 17 km southwest of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The population is 25,140 (2010), and the area is 49.18 km².\n\nThe town is noted by Catholics in Spain and Latin America as a place of veneration of the Virgin of Candelaria, the patron of the Canary Islands. The most prominent building is the Basilica of Candelaria, which includes the sculpture of the Virgin Mary (Virgin of Candelaria) and mural paintings. Also highlighted in the square, statues of the nine aboriginal kings of Tenerife.\n\nIn the times of the Guanches, the region was part of the \"menceyato\", or kingdom, of Güímar. A cave is situated around Candelaria. The famous \"Festival de la Canción de Candelaria\" is one of the most important festivities on the island. It celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2005.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic epochs this zone pertained to Güímar's aboriginal Menceyato. It was accepted that the aboriginal name of the zone was simply \"Güímar\" as the whole menceyato. After the conquest, this zone was called \"Candelaria\", in honor to the virgin patron of the archipelago, the Virgin of Candelaria.\n\nThe town of Candelaria is surrounded by several prehistoric caves, where burials have been found containing mummies of the Guanches, whose burial process is very similar to the treatment of the pharaohs in Egypt.\n\nIn 1390, the current Candelaria was a solitary and deserted place where the shepherds would frenguent the Guanches of Güimar's menceyato (Güímar's pre-Hispanic kingdom). One evening, two natives who were leading his cattle, saw some goats come to the mouth of the ravine. The natives found, on a rock, the Holy Image of the Virgin of Candelaria (declared principal patron saint of the Canary Islands with posteriority).\n\nThe image was found in a beach near to Candelaria, initially the image was moved to the Cave of Chinguaro, which was the palace of the King of Güímar.\n\nBut later, the same guanches moved her to Cueva de Achbinico in Candelaria, and there it has been venerated since then. The aboriginals identified her with the appearance of their goddess Chaxiraxi (the mother of the gods), but the Christian conquerors insisted that the image was the Virgin Mary. Later a hermitage was constructed and later the Basilica was constructed to Santa Maria.\n\nNowadays Candelaria is the principal Catholic center of pilgrimage of the Canaries and one of the principal ones of Spain.\n\nThe current image of the Virgin of Candelaria is to dress. The image always turns out to be covered by mantles and jeweler's shop, also she is curiously very venerated by the Hindu community of the Canaries, they refer to her as the black virgin. The image goes out in procession every February 2 (day of Candelaria) and August 15 (day of the Patron of Canaries). The latter date is linked to a former aboriginal celebration (Beñesmen, the crop). It is believed that the Virgin Mary appeared on these dates.\n\nNowadays, the municipality is visited by thousands of people, not only devout to the Virgin of Candelaria, but tourists exploring the Canary culture.\n\nThe municipality has a beach located to the east and is famous for tourism. Candelaria's municipality receives the annual peregrination of Candelaria (on February 2 and on August 15, the latter is the most important), as well as to the pilgrims who visit the municipality in all other epochs of the year. The principal stops of any visit are the Basilica of Candelaria and Cueva de Achbinico, but there are other places of interest in the village:\n\nThe current basilica dates back of 1959, it was constructed on a former hermitage. When you leave the basilica you stand out on the belfry coast, to your feet one finds the Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias. Since the image of the Virgin was appearing on the beach of Chimisay, around 1392, the first great Sanctuary to the Virgin of Candelaria was constructed in 1668. Later with the increase of the peregrinations of the devout ones, there was created the need to construct a bigger temple (the current basilica), which has capacity for 5,000 persons.\n\nThe basilica is in the south part of the city, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. Close to the Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias they find the bronze statues of 9 aboriginal kings. Next to the basilica is the Dominican convent religious order in charge of the sanctuary. The basilic also has a large collection of wall paintings. The temple and Royal Basilica Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Candelaria, is considered the main temple dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the Canary Islands.\n\nAlso so called Cave of San Blas, it was the first Christian temple of Canary Islands, in this place the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands produced worship to the Virgin of Candelaria. According to recent archaeological layers of ash found and submitted for consideration are carbon-14 dating back over three thousand years. In this cave a fire was kept on permanently, something like the temple of the Vestal Virgins of ancient Rome.\n\nThe Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias (\"Square of the Saint Patron of the Canary Islands\") his a large square in Candelaria. It is next to the Basilica of Candelaria, a meeting place of pilgrims and festivities celebrating the most important of the municipality. In this square there are also various bars and cafes. On one side of the square are statues of the nine kings who ruled the nine aboriginal guanches menceyatos (pre-Hispanic kingdoms) of Tenerife.\n\nIt is the shopping street of the town par excellence where you can find different souvenir stores, religious imagery and crafts. The street runs parallel to the coast and the promenade of the city to the Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias and the Basilica of Candelaria.\n\nIt is a church dedicated to St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary and is the parish in the municipality of Candelaria. The church is the mid-eighteenth century, but was built on a sixteenth-century chapel. The temple has many religious images of great religious and artistic intervals.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2290191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290191", "title": "Shasta people", "text": "Shasta people\n\nThe Shastan peoples are a group of linguistically related indigenous peoples from the Klamath Mountains. They traditionally inhabited portions of several regional waterways, including the Klamath, Salmon, Sacramento and McCloud rivers. Shastan lands presently form portions of the Siskiyou, Klamath and Jackson counties. Scholars have generally divided the Shastan peoples into four languages, although arguments in favor of more or less existing have been made. Speakers of Shasta proper-Kahosadi, Konomihu, Okwanuchu, and Tlohomtah’hoi \"New River\" Shasta resided in settlements typically near a water source. Their villages often had only either one or two families. Larger villages had more families and additional buildings utilised by the community.\n\nThe California Gold Rush drew in an influx of outsiders into California in the late 1840s eager to gain mineral wealth. For the Shasta, this was a devastating process as their lands soon had thousands of miners operating along various waterways. Conflicts arose as the outsiders didn't respect the Shasta or their homeland. Introduction to new diseases and fighting against invading Americans rapidly reduced the number of Shasta. The Shasta residents of Bear Creek were active in Rogue River Wars and assisted the Takelma until they were forcibly removed to the Grande Ronde and Siletz Reservations in Oregon. In the late 1850s the Shastan peoples of California were forcibly removed from their territories and also sent to the same two distant reservations. By the early years of the 20th century perhaps only 100 Shasta individual existed. Some Shasta descendants still reside at the Grand Ronde and Siletz Reservations, while others are in Siskiyou county at the Quartz Valley Indian Reservation or Yreka. Many former members of the Shasta tribe have also been inducted into the Karuk and Alturas tribes.\n\nPrior to contact with European descendants the term Shasta likely wasn't used by the Shastan peoples themselves. Among the Shasta proper they called themselves \"Kahosadi\" or \"plain speakers\". Variations of Shasta used by whites include Chasta, Shasty, Tsashtl, Sasti, and Saste. Dixon noted that the Shastan peoples didn't use \"Shasta\" as a place name and likely wasn't a word at all in their languages. In interviews with Shasta informants Dixon was informed of a prominent man of Scott Valley that lived up until the 1850s with the name of Susti or Sustika. This was the probable origin of the term according to Dixon, an interpretation that Kroeber agreed with. Merriam reviewed information from Albert Samuel Gatschet and fur trader Peter Skene Ogden, concluding that while the Shastan peoples didn't refer to themselves as Shasta traditionally; the nearby Klamath likely did. Scholars have largely accepted Dixon's etymology for Shasta. Renfro questions its validity however as Ogden used a variation of the term before Sustika was likely prominent.\n\nIn 1814, near the Willamette Trading Post a meeting occurred between North West Company officer Alexander Henry and an assembled Sahaptin congregation of Cayuse and Walla Walla, in addition to a third group of people that was named Shatasla. Maloney argued that Shatasla was an archaic variant of Shasta. something Garth later conjectured as well. This interpretation has been contested by other scholars based on linguistic and historical evidence. Previous to Maloney's assertion, Frederick Hodge in 1910 noted the word Shatalsa as being related to word Sahaptin. This older etymology was defended by Stern against Maloney's interpretation, in addition to recently being accepted by Clark as well.\n\nThe Shasta were the numerically largest of the Shastan speakers. Their territories spread from around modern Ashland in the north, Jenny Creek and Mt. Shasta to the east, southward to the Scott Mountains, and westward to modern Seiad Valley and the Salmon and Marble Mountains. This area had four important waterways, each of which had a distinct group of resident Shasta. These were the Klamath River and two of its tributaries, the Shasta River and Scott River, along with the Bear Creek in the Rogue Valley. Four bands of Shasta existed with variations in custom and differing dialects. Each band had names derived from nearby waterways. In this way people from Shasta River or Ahotidae were the \"Ahotireitsu\", those from the Upper Rogue Valley or Ikiruk were the \"Ikirukatsu\", and inhabitants of Scott River or Iraui were the \"Irauitsu\". Shasta families located directly along the Klamath River were referred to by the Ikirukatsu as \"Wasudigwatsu\" after their particular words for the Klamath River and gulch. The Irauistu knew them as \"Wiruwhikwatsu\" and the Ahotireitsu called them \"Wiruwhitsu\", terms derived from \"down river\" and \"up river\" respectively.\n\nShasta settlements often only contained a single family. In larger villages headmen held sway. The responsibilities of this position were varied. They were expected \"to exhort the people to live in peace, do good, have kind hearts, and be industrious.\" A common requirement to hold the position was that the individual had to be materially wealthy. This came from the expectation for them to use their property in negotiations to settles disputes between members of their village or with other settlements. In raids on enemies the headman did not participate but negotiated with enemy headmen to establish peaceable relations. Each of the four Shasta bands had individual headmen as well. While only the Ikirukatsu were reported to have had hereditary succession to the position it is thought the other three bands had some form hereditarian succession as well. While each of the four band headmen were considered equal, in particularly trying disputes the Ikirukatsu headman would negotiate an end to the issue.\n\nThree related groups of Shastan speakers resided adjacent to the Shasta proper. These were the Okwanuchu of the upper Sacramento and McCloud rivers, and the Salmon River based Konomihu and Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta. There is little recorded information on the Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta, Konomihu and Okwanuchu. Merriam concluded that \"any extended discussion of their culture, customs, beliefs, and ceremonies is out of the question...\" Each group had particularly small territories. The Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta held , the Okwanuchu had , and the Konomihu only occupied .\n\nThe Shasta called the Konomihu \"Iwáppi\", related to the term used for the Karuk. The Konomihu referred to themselves as \"Ḱunummíhiwu\". They inhabited portions of the north and south forks of the Salmon River, in addition to part of the combined waterway. Seventeen settlements are recorded to have existed within Konomihu territory. Political authority was more fragmented than the Shasta, reportedly there being no form of appointed or hereditary village headmen. Most knowledge of Konomihu interactions with neighboring peoples has been lost. It is known that despite occasional disputes with the Irauitsu Shasta, intermarriage was common. The Irauitsu appear to have been important trading partners as well. In return for their buckskin garments the Konomihu received abalone beads.\n\nIt is not known what the autonym of the Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta was. However it is known that the Shasta likely referred to them as \"tax·a·ʔáycu\", the Hupa called them \"Yɨdahčɨn\" or \"those from upcountry (away from the stream)\", while the Karok called them \"Kà·sahʔára·ra\" or \"person of ka·sah\". The Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta largely lived in the Salmon River basin despite the scholarly appellation, though they did reside on the forks of the New River. There were at least five reported settlements inhabited by Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta according to information gained from particular informants. Residents of the New River forks were proposed by Merriam to speak a distinct language from the Salmon River inhabitants. Dixon criticized the idea and presented evidence for the linguistic unity of the cultural group. Merriam's conclusion of there being two differing languages between the Tlohomtah’hoi Shasta group has not been adopted by other scholars.\n\nWhat information has been preserved about the Okwanuchu amounts to little. The origin of the word Okwanuchu is unknown. They were called \"ye·tatwa\" and \"Ikusadewi\" by the Achomawi. Intermarriage between Okwanuchu and Achomawi speakers was apparently common.\n\nEstimates for historic Shasta, Okwanuchu, New River Shasta, and Konomihu population figures have substantially varied, as is true for most native groups in California. In the 1990s some Shasta stated upwards of 10,000 Shastan peoples lived in the 1840s. Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Shasta proper as 2,000 and the New River, Konomihu, and Okwanuchu groups, along with the Chimariko, as 1,000. Using population information on a nearby culture, Sherburne F. Cook largely agreed with Kroeber and concluded there were about 2,210 Shasta proper and another 1,000 related peoples. Subsequently, however Cook raised the figure to 5,900 total Shasta, inclusive of the smaller related cultures. Kroeber estimated the population of the Shasta proper in 1910 as 100.\n\nThe Shastan peoples had a diet based around locally available food sources. Many plant and animal species that existed in Shasta territories were located in adjacent areas. These food sources were commonly gathered and used by the Shasta and other regional cultures. The large populations of game animals in the Shasta territories led to many confrontation from other California Natives keen on gaining animal meat and pelts. Strategies to procure and later store these foodstuffs shared similarities with adjoining cultures. Undergrowth in forests was removed with controlled fires to promote advantageous plant species that were often food sources.\n\nFishing runs began in the spring and continued throughout the summer and autumn. The White Deerskin dance by the Karuk determined the appropriate time for the Shasta to eat fish. Held sometime in July, the dance was an important event for Shasta to witness and known as \"kuwarik\". Prior to the event Coho salmon could be caught and dried, but not consumed. Rainbow trout had to be released before the Karuk dance. Not doing so was seen as particularly egregious and made one liable to be killed. Spears were reportedly uncommon for use in fishing among the Shasta. Fires were created and maintained at weirs to enable efficient night fishing. Fishing nets designs were near identical to those created by Karuk and Yurok. Catfish and crawfish were caught with bait tied to lines. Once stuck on the line, the prey would be captured with a thin basket.\n\nCalifornia mule deer were hunted according to one of several strategies employed by the Shasta. In the autumn at mineral licks deer were forced by controlled burning of oak leaves into gaps between the flames where hunters would wait. Shasta also chased deer into nooses that were tied to trees. Alternatively dogs were trained to chase deer into creeks. Hidden until their prey was in the water, Shasta hunters would then kill the deer with arrows. There were a number of societal conventions related to the ownership of the deer. For example, whoever killed the prey had right to its pelt and hind legs. Other reported conventions regulated the divisions of meat in a fair manner and when Shasta were allowed to hunt.\n\nAdditional nutritional sources included several smaller animal species. Mussels were collected from the Klamath River by women and children that dived for the organisms. During the autumn the river shrunk in size, leaving exposed populations of mussels along the river banks. Once gathered in a sufficient quantity the mussels steamed in earthen ovens. Then the shells were opened and the meat dried through sunlight for future use. Grasshoppers and crickets were consumed by both the Ahotireitsu and Ikirukatsu Shasta. Parcels of grasslands were set ablaze by Shasta men. After the fires had died down the cooked grasshoppers were collected and dried. When grasshoppers were served with particular grass seeds the insects were pounded into a fine powder. Visitors to Shasta Valley would join Ahotireitsu during periods of abundant insect populations to collect their own food stores.\n\nAcorns were a valuable foodstuff in Shasta cuisine. Local sources of the nut included the Canyon Oak, California Black Oak and the Oregon White Oak. After leeching the acorns of tannins the nuts were turned into a dough. Black Oak meal was preferred compared to the slimier and less popular White Oak meal for both consumption and trade. Canyon Oak acorns were often buried and allowed to turn black before being cooked. Often nuts from Sugar pines were steamed, dried and stored for future consumption. Pitch from the Ponderosa pine was pounded into a fine dust and consumed or used as a chewing gum. Many fruits were harvested once ripe and often dried. This included Chokecherries, Whiteleaf manzanita berries, Pacific blackberries, San Diego raspberries, and Blue elderberries.\n\nFlower bulbs were gathered seasonally to supplement other food stores. Camas roots were commonly collected. Members of the calochortus genus were known as \"ipos\" to the Shasta who relished them. Once the bulb was husked ipos roots were consumed raw or dried in sunlight and later stored. Shastan cuisine had many meals that included dried ipos. Guests were often given small servings of serviceberries and dried ipos while the main meal cooked. One particularly popular dish was powdered ipos root mixed into manzanita cider. Another consumed flowering plant species was Fritillaria recurva. Commonly called \"chwau\", the bulbs were prepared by either roasting or boiling.\n\nShasta architecture appears to have large been derived from the downriver Hupa, Karuk and Yurok peoples. Permanent houses were constructed by the Shasta for the winter. These dwellings were built in the same locations annually, commonly near a creek. Klamath River Shasta winter villages commonly had only 3 families, while Dixon has suggested that both Irauitsu and Ahotireitsu villages usually had more families. The beginning of a winter house started with excavating a pit. Common dimensions rectangular or oval shaped excavation were by , with a depth of . Once the area was cleared load bearing wooden poles were placed in the excavated corners. Additional wooden supports and posts placed throughout the structure. After the pit walls were covered with cedar-bark, the sugar-pine or cedar wooden roof was finally put into place.\n\nThe okwá'ŭmma (\"big house\") was a structure maintained in populous Shasta villages. A pit up to wide, wide and deep was dug, with a building process similar to winter dwellings employed. Their functionality was primarily for assemblies, such as seasonal religious ceremonies and dances. Dixon incorrectly reported that okwá'ŭmma were used as sweat houses. If a villager had too many guests for their house, permission would be secured to use the okwá'ŭmma instead. Okwá'ŭmma were owned by a prominent individual, often the headman, and constructed with communal labor. They were uncommon buildings, as along the Klamath River perhaps only three existed. Male relatives of the owner inherited the structure, if only female relatives remained it was burnt down.\n\nDwellings utilized by the Konomihu varied according to season like the Shasta. During the salmon runs of spring and summer huts created from plant brush were used. These were abandoned in the autumn in favor of bark houses while deer were hunted. These winter houses were markedly different from the Shasta, Karuk and Yurok. While partially underground their houses were built in 15 to 18 foot wide circles with sloped conical roofs.\n\nAn important item for Shasta households were baskets which principally came from the Karuk. The Konomihu likewise largely imported their baskets from abroad. Baskets made by Shasta were generally a composite of plant materials gathered from the Ponderosa pine, California hazelnut, several species of Willow, Bear grass, and the Five-fingered fern. Their designs took influences from the nearby Hupa, Karuk and Yurok peoples. Pigments were made by the Shasta for the beautification of baskets and other personal possessions. Red and black dyes were the most commonly used and come from acorns and alder bark respectively.\n\nRopes, cordage and manufactured goods such as mats, nets and clothing were largely derived from Indian hemp. During the winter snow shoes were often necessary to traverse their homeland. These were made primarily from deer hide with the fur left on. Dentalium shells were an important possession for the Shasta. Principally they were used for ornamentation through being sown into clothing, in addition to usage as a bartering medium. Konomihu produced buckskin leggings, robes and skirts that were painted with black, red and white patterns and adorned with dentalia and abalone beads. Okwanuchu crafted tubular wooden pipes similar in design to those made by Wintu. Raccoon and fox pelts were used for protection against the harsh mountain winters. Moccasins were kept waterproof and soft with oils derived from either deer, fish, cougars or bears.\n\nCharles Wilkes described Shasta made weaponry in 1845:\"Their bows and arrows are beautifully made: the former are of yew and about three feet long; they are flat, and an inch and a half to two inches wide: these are backed very neatly with sinew, and painted. The arrows are upwards of thirty inches long; some of them were made of a close-grained wood, a species of spiraea, while others were of reed; they were feathered for a length of from five to eight inches, and the barbed heads were beautifully wrought from obsidian... Their quivers are made of deer, raccoon, or wild-cat skin; these skins are generally whole, being left open at the tail end.\"\n\nBody decoration and modification were common practices among the Shasta. For example, they employed dyes of red, yellow, blue, black and white in their artwork. These dyes were created from plant matter and natural clay deposits. Reportedly body painting was largely used by shamans and those preparing for warfare. The latter group generally used white and black colors during their war preparations. Red was applied by shamans upon their buckskins in geometric patterns.\n\nPermanent tattooing was performed by elder women who used small obsidian flakes. Tattoos for women were generally several vertical marks on the chin that occasionally were prolonged to the edges of the mouth. Women without chin tattoos were seen as unattractive and targets of ridicule. For men tattoos had an important functionality in bartering and exchanges. Applied in lines on their hands or arms, these lines were used to measure dentalia and beads. Septum piercings were made to hold either a long dentalia shell or ornate feathers, while ear piercings held an assembled group of dentalia.\n\nWarfare was principally performed in asymmetrical small raids. Leaders of these attacks were determined by raiding party members. An armed group was organized usually to redress aggression and violence against village members. Prisoners gained in raids were not often killed and instead were allowed to live as a slave. Slavery was reportedly not widespread among the Shasta and wasn't seen as a favorable practice. Dixon stated that \"persons owning slaves were said to be, in a way, looked down upon.\"\n\nShasta warriors wore protective adornments when headed into a conflict. Stick armor was preferred over the alternative elkhide. Materials for stick armor were largely sourced from serviceberry trees and woven together tightly with twine. As a rule head coverings were made from elk hide, sometimes placed in several layers thick. Notably Shasta women could join in both preparations for an upcoming attack and as active participants in the battle itself. Dixon recorded in such instances women would be armed with obsidian knives and attempt to disarm or destroy the weapons of enemy combatants.\n\nArmed warriors came largely from the Klamath River and Ahotireitsu Shasta in conflicts with the Modoc. These clashes have been speculated to have been the most violent for the Shasta by scholars. While disputes and raids occurred with the Wintu, they were apparently not as destructive as warfare with the Modoc. Attacks on Wintu and Modoc villages included torching the settlement. This was not practiced in raids between Shasta villages.\n\nThe Shasta were located at the crossroads of several major cultural regions. This was reflected in their neighbors, each with distinct material and cultural conditions. To the southwest on the lower Klamath River were the Karuk, Yurok and Hupa. Past the southern borders of Shasta territory resided the Wintu. They were the northernmost extension of a central Californian culture focused on the Russian River Pomo and the Patwin. To the east and southeast were the Achomawi and Atsugewi, with whom the Shasta have some linguistic affiliations. Kroeber placed the Achomawi and Atsugewi with the northeastern Modoc and Klamath into the \"Northeast\" cultural group. They received cultural influences from the Columbia Plateau and Columbia River Sahaptins, far more than the Shasta did.\n\nComing from the Shasta word for \"down the river\" the Karuk were known as \"Iwampi\". Along with the Yurok, both nations inspired many facets of Shasta society and were their principal trading partners. These peoples were particularly similar to the Shasta and these ethnicities formed the southern terminus \"of that great and distinctive culture [...] common to all peoples of the Pacific coast from Oregon to Alaska.\" Additional members of this grouping included the Tolowa further to the west and the Takelma located to the north.\n\nThe Karuk culture was held in a favorable regard by most Shasta, particularly for their manufactured items. Shasta merchants would bring stockpiles of trade goods in demand down river, which included a variety of preserved foodstuffs, animal pelts, and obsidian blades. Merchandise found desirable by the Shasta included Tan Oak acorns, Yurok produced redwood canoes, a gamut of baskets of varying designs, seaweed, dentalia and abalone beads. The Karuk also were the primary source of dentalia for the Konomihu as well. Baskets and hats used by the Shasta were acquired primarily with these Klamath River nations.\n\nThe delimitation of territory with the Takelma to the north has been a matter of controversy between scholars. Shasta informants told Roland B. Dixon that they previously occupied the Bear Creek Valley southward and eastward of the Table Rocks. He was additionally given Shasta place names of this area. This information was forwarded to Edward Sapir who suggested that the Shasta and Takelma both utilized this disputed region of the Rogue Valley. Alfred Kroeber would in turn claim that Shasta territories extended as far north as modern Trail, Oregon.\n\nBased on a review on accounts by Takelma and Shasta informants and the journal of Ogden, Gray has determined and proposed a revised cultural boundary. During the early 19th century the southern Bear Creek valley was used by both the Shasta and Takelma peoples as Sapir had speculated. The higher portions of the local Neil and Emigrant Creeks, in addition to the northern Siskiyou slopes close to Siskiyou Summit were Shasta areas. Regardless of their conflicts over the Bear Creek Valley, the Takelma were active trading partners with the Shasta and were a major source of dentalia.\n\nKnown as the \"Ipaxanai\" from the Shasta word for \"lake\", the Modoc were traditionally held in low regard and were seen as without much material wealth by the Shasta. For example, a Shasta informant reported that \"How could you settle anything with them? They didn't have any money.\" There was an amount of commercial transactions between the Shasta and the Klamath but these were apparently rare occurrences. Spier reported that Shasta manufactured beads were exchanged for animal pelts and blankets. Outside of trading with the Modoc, this was some of the only trading done between the Klamath and the Indigenous peoples of California. Both the Modoc and their Klamath relatives gained horses in the 1820s. This greatly enhanced their military capabilities which began a period of attacks on their southern and western neighbors. Both the Ahotireitsu and Klamath River Shasta bands were targets of Modoc slave raiding.\n\nThe Achomawi and Atsugewi speakers resided to the east in the Pit River basin. Not much has been recorded on interactions the Shasta had with them. It is known that the Shasta were the principal source of dentalia for both peoples. There was some direct contact with the Atsugewi though it was probably minimal. Atsugewi informants agreed that they traditionally had many shared cultural traits with the Shasta especially their similar \"religion, mythology, social organization, political organization, puberty customs, and paucity of ceremonial.\" The Madhesi band of Achomawi were known to have had occasional disputes. Villages in the vicinity of modern Big Bend were liable to be raided by Shasta warriors.\n\nBands of Wintu located around modern McCloud, California and in the Upper Sacramento Valley had the majority of interactions with the Shasta. While clashes did occur with Wintu speakers, it wasn't nearly as common as conflict with the Modoc. These conflicts earned the Shasta the Wintun name of \"yuki\" or \"enemy\". Despite the occasional skirmish there was some commercial and cultural exchanges between the peoples. The Wintu were an active source of Tan oak acorns and abalone beads. The Shasta were the primary distributors of dentalia to the Wintu, along with some obsidian and buckskin. A drink made by both the Shasta and the Wintu was a cider created from Manzanita berries. Members of both cultures were inspired by the manufactured goods created by the other nation. Ahotireitsu Shasta considered clothing made by Wintu fashionable and made hats from Indian hemp after their style. Upper Sacramento Valley and McCloud Wintu admired the smooth headgear used by the Shasta. These twine hats were copied by the Wintu, who used material from Woodwardia ferns in their reproductions more often than among their own designs.\n\nOriginating from the Chinook Jargon word for an American, \"Boston,\" the Shasta word for whites is \"pastin.\" The Shasta were isolated from the Spanish to the south and their Californian colonies. When the Mexican War of Independence erupted Mexican officials assumed control of the Spanish settlements and missions by forming the Alta California territory. This didn't change matters for the natives north of the Californian Ranchos as they maintained their territorial autonomy and protected position against European descendants. Sometime around the 1820s the Modoc and Klamath adopted horses from the Sahaptin peoples to the north. With their new equestrian rides they began to attack the Shasta, Achomawi and Atsugewi for property, food stores and slaves to be sold at the Dalles. The Shasta actively fought against the invaders although they didn't gain sizable numbers of horses.\n\nThe first recorded encounter with European descendants for the Shasta came in 1826. A Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) expedition under Peter Skene Ogden departed from Fort Vancouver to trap beavers in the Klamath Mountains. Arriving from the east, Ogden's party was favorably received by Shasta. Ogden was disappointed by the small number of beaver in the mountainous region and shifted the party north to the Rogue Valley across the Siskiyous. Shasta guides accompanied them until shortly before modern Talent. The HBC continued to send expeditions southward through the Klamath Mountains to harvest beaver populations in Alta California. These groups of fur trappers and their families traveled along the Siskiyou Trail which traversed portions of the Shasta homelands.\n\nThe following known interaction with whites wasn't peaceable as Ogden's visit had been. A group of Willamette Valley colonists traversed Shasta territories in the autumn of 1837. With them were several hundred cattle purchased from Alta California Governor Alvarado. Driving their herd north along the Siskiyou Trail, they encountered several Shasta settlements. The Shasta were welcoming to the outsiders despite difficulties in communication. Philip Leget Edwards recorded that the cattle drivers were \"at their mercy, but they have offered no injury to ourselves or property.\" A Shasta boy estimated by Edwards to be the age of ten accompanied the settlers for some time. As the group continued north some of the cattle men began to discuss killing natives of the area. William J. Bailey and George K. Gay had previously had fought against a group of Takelma of the Rogue Valley, getting injured and losing several companions. They considered the Shasta to be acceptable targets to attack for revenge. A Shasta man was found and shot to death by Gay and Bailey. They also attempted to murder the Shasta youth that had joined the cattle herders but he escaped. While officer Ewing Young was furious at the murder, the majority of the party condoned the murder. Bailey and Gay faced no punishment for their actions and the party continued toward the Willamette Valley.\n\nSeveral years later a portion of the United States Exploring Expedition under the command of Lieutenant George F. Emmons (1838-1842) visited the Klamath Mountains. Emmons had been given instructions by Charles Wilkes to explore the headwaters of the Klamath, Sacramento, and Umpqua rivers. The assembled men had departed from Fort Vancouver to Fort Umpqua during the summer of 1841. During September and October they traveled through Shasta territories by generally following the Siskiyou Trail. On 1 October the party crossed the Klamath River. The explorers visited a Shasta village where inhabitants gave them salmon and sold several yew bows and arrows in exchange for trade goods. Inhabitants of the village demonstrated their archery skills by repeatedly shooting a button from distant. At this demonstration was an elder Shasta man who was a father-in-law to Michel Laframboise. Shortly after this peaceable dialogue and trade Emmons ordered the party to depart for \"Destruction river\" (the Upper Sacramento River) exiting Shasta lands for those of the Okwanuchu and later the Wintu.\n\nThe irregular contact with European descendants became far more frequent by the 1840s. Military forces of the United States conquered Alta California during the Mexican–American War. American control was initially limited to areas that had been administered by the Mexican government. The California Territory was established in 1849 although much of the claimed land still remained in indigenous hands. The California State Legislature organized Shasta County in 1850. Once it was firmly in control by American colonists it was speculated to become an important region for its agricultural and mineral potential. In 1852 Siskiyou County was formed from the northern portions of Shasta County. This new American division contained the Shasta homelands of California.\n\nThe lure of achieving material wealth created the California Gold Rush and drew in outsiders by the hundreds of thousands. The newly arriving miners and colonists had little respect for California Natives and frequently spread violence against indigenous peoples. Miners progressively went north from Sutter's Mill in search of more gold. During 1850 discoveries of gold were made on the Trinity and Klamath rivers. In the Shasta heartland along the banks of the Salmon, Scott and upper Klamath gold was found during the following two years. Incoming miners founded the towns of Scott Bar and Yreka near these newer sources. The Shasta weren't seen favorably by incoming miners, being considered to have \"inherited a spirit of warfare, and delight in [...] perilous incidents of daring thefts or bold fighting. This image of native aggression was repeatedly mentioned in contemporary newspapers. The Shasta and other natives in the north were apparently found to be \"more warlike than those of any other section of the State, and bear the most implacable hatred towards all pale faces.\"\n\nBy August 1850 there were over 2,000 miners prospecting on Klamath and Salmon rivers. Over a hundred miles of the Klamath River had been searched for gold deposits and portions were occupied by mining operations. While the Shasta River hadn't yet been exploited it was considered by miners to contain rich gold deposits. In the winter of 1850 advertisements appeared in the \"Daily Alta California\" promoting the mineral potential of the Klamath River basin. These notices appealed for Americans to venture north where opportunities for acquiring wealth abound. In addition to maintaining extensive mining operations, whites began to cut forests down for sale in Sacramento. A thousand acres of Shasta river had been prospected to varying amounts by April 1851. Scott River became touted as having \"the richest mines in all California.\" Contemporaries described an influx of miners into the northern region. \"The tide of emigration to Scott's River [...] flows due north, sweeping everything in its way...\" Redick McKee visited the Scott River in October 1851. He reported that \"squatter' tents and cabins may be seen on almost every little patch or strip where the soil promises a reward to cultivation.\" Additionally he noted the Scott River was under heavy modification by miners. \"Every yard almost for three or four miles is either dam or race work.\"\n\nAs the population of non-natives rose in the north genocide of the indigenous was considered. Miners argued that natives along the Klamath River and its tributaries impeded access to gold deposits. They were deemed \"the only obstacle to complete success in those mines.\" The Sacramento Daily Union argued that \"the Indians must soon be removed by the Government Agents, or be exterminated by the sword of the whites.\" Violence and murder against natives were often promoted as the only way to end their \"thieving and other annoying propensities.\" Violence began to erupt across the Klamath River in the summer of 1850. In August it was reported that miners had killed fifty to sixty Hupa and burnt down three of their villages around the juncture of the Klamath and Trinity rivers. At the junction of the Shasta and Klamath rivers in October a confrontation erupted in which miners killed six Shasta.\n\nThe Indian Superintendency gave a report to Congress in November 1848. It was an overview on native population figures in the recently gained Pacific Coast and Southwest. Congress was advised to fund and hire new Indian agents in these new territories. A report presented to Congress in 1850 by William Carey Jones surmised information he gathered on land title in California. Jones concluded that Spanish and Mexican law didn't recognize the right of natives to owning their homelands. After the admission of California as an American state the topic of relations with its indigenous peoples was raised in the Senate once more. Charles Fremont presented legislation that promoted the forced seizure of their lands for resale to American colonists. He however felt that the natives had legal right to their own territories and had to be compensated for their territorial losses. This was far from a universal opinion in the Senate as some legislators felt California Indigenous had no legal right to their own homelands.\n\nIn September the Senate passed two bills that formulated Federal policy with Californian Natives. Three commissioners were authorized to draft treaties with California Natives. Redick McKee, O. M. Wozencraft, and George W. Barbour were appointed and began negotiations in 1851. However they collectively lacked expertise and familiarity with either California natives or how their societies utilized their territories. The Commissioners eventually divided California into three areas to cover the large amount of travelling necessary to create treaties with every native group. This meant they were operating independent of each other. McKee was assigned the task of creating treaties with natives of Northern California. He and his entourage created agreements with natives in Humboldt Bay and the lower Klamath River. Later in September 1851 he arrived in Shasta territory.\n\nMcKee toured the Shasta territories; inspecting the Shasta and Scott vallies in particular. It was concluded that only the Scott could support a reservation and the agricultural work necessary to feed the Shasta. This assessment was due to the scarcity of agriculturally viable land in the Klamath Mountains. More promising areas did exist nearby but they were in Oregon. The Shasta wanted to retain the entirety of Scott Valley for their designated reservation. American colonists from Scott Bar and Shasta Butte City contended for possession of the valley as well. Federal officials consulted with them for what they desired in a treaty with the Shasta. They called for the removal of all Shasta to a reservation placed on the headwaters of the Shasta River.\n\nGeorge Gibbs was a member of McKee's delegation and left a record of its activities. There was a repeating cycle of violence and reprisals then ongoing in northern California. Local American militias were reported to be excessively violent in \"revenging outrages\" supposedly committed by natives. Gibbs argued for the establishment of US Army post at or near the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. He felt it was necessary to maintain peaceable relations between the colonists and various natives peoples in the Klamath Basin. The government was suggested to model its native policies in Northern California after those of employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in the Columbia Department. Select individuals would be given material patronage which would assist them in gaining prominence among their local settlements. This in turn would simplify interactions with various native cultures as power gradually centralized under amendable leadership. There wasn't a fort located in this vicinity until 1858, when Fort Gaston was established in modern Hoopa.\n\nThe terms drafted by McKee for an agreement were not particularly favored by the Shasta or American settlers. The reservation was placed in Scott Valley although the majority of the valley was to remain in colonist possession. The location of the Shasta reservation was apparently accepted, albeit grudgingly, by most American colonists of the area. Some had purchased expensive land grants from other Americans. A variation of the Donation Land Claim Act was expected to soon be enacted in California. Financial compensation from Congress or the Indian Department was expected by Americans with properties within the reservation boundaries.\n\nThe area specified in the treaty for the reservation was estimated by McKee to contain four or five square miles of arable land. The Shasta were promised to receive \"free of charge\" 20,000 pounds of flour, 200 cattle, a large inventory of garments, and a multitude of household goods from the Federal government throughout 1852 and 1853. Funding was to be appropriated in Congress for employing a carpenter, a group of farmers and several teachers on the reservation. Prospecting along the Scott river was to be allowed for two additional years. Any additional mining operations within the reservation had a single year to continue.\n\nAt the end of the discussions a bull was presented to the Shasta. A celebration was held which lasted late into the evening. Gibbs recorded the day assigned for the formal signing of the treaty:\"In the morning, November 4th, the treaty was explained carefully as drawn up and the bounds of the reservation pointed out on a plat. In the afternoon it was signed in the presence of a large concourse of whites and Indians, with great formality.\"\n\nSome ethnographic informants gave accounts of three thousand Shasta being present at the ceremony. They were reportedly served beef poisoned with strychnine by American officials. Survivors told of spending weeks locating the deceased. Only around 150 Shasta were said to have survived.\n\nThe treaties negotiated by McKee, Barbour, and Wozencraft amounted to 18. McKee pressed for the California legislature to accept the treaties. He argued the reservations were designed to allocate natives to keep portions of their traditional lands while keeping open the many areas bearing gold. The commissioners were stated to have always consulted with local American colonists and miners in establishing the borders of each reservation. Pointedly he went on to argue that unless if someone were to \"propose a more humane and available system\" the reservations had to be acknowledged by the California Government. The state rejected all treaties and instructed its representatives in Washington, D.C. to lobby against them as well.\n\nThe treaties were endorsed by President Millard Fillmore, commissioner of Indian affairs Luke Lea and the recently appointed superintendent of Indian affairs for California Edward Fitzgerald Beale. The treaties were sent the Committee on Indian Affairs in June 1852. After a closed session the treaties were rejected. Ellison suggested that the vast amount of land set aside by the treaties and the expenditures allocated by the commissioners made the agreements unpopular in Congress. In total about or about 7% of the total land area of California was to contain the 18 reservations. Heizer concluded that the process of drafting treaties made by the Commissioners and their eventual rejection in the U.S. Congress \"was a farce from beginning to end...\"\n\nViolence against the Shasta continued after the agreement with McKee. On 18 January 1852 three American men attacked and killed a Shasta individual without provocation on Humbug Creek. A panic arose among the local Shasta who fled into the nearby mountains. This senseless killing caused a panic among the miners. They feared that this breach of the new treaty would provoke conflict with the Shasta. McKee was requested to return to the area and mediate a solution. Although one of the murderers escaped two of the men were captured by the miners. The slain man's familial relations were given six blankets as compensation pending a ruling of the three murderers.\n\nIn July 1852 a party of miners found and killed fourteen Shasta people in Shasta Valley in revenge for the murder of a white man. This escalation of violence continued to deplete the number of Shasta. Their reprisals against white violence were to protect \"their communities from assault, abduction, unfree labor, rape, murder, massacre, and, ultimately, obliteration.\"\n\nAmericans in Cottonwood organized the \"Squaw Hunters\" in January 1854. It was an armed group made to \"get squaws, by force, if necessary…\" That month they went to a nearby cave where over 50 Shasta were residing. The Squaw Hunters attacked the Shasta there and killed 3 children, 2 women and 3 men. Afterwards they claimed the Shasta were preparing for an attack on Americans. This false rumor created a panic among settlers. 28 men gathered to attack the cave. In the skirmish four Americans and one Shasta died. Federal troops from Fort Jones and local volunteers assembled on the Klamath River five miles away from the cave. In total about fifty armed Americans were present. Additional forces from Fort Lane arrived with a howitzer. It was fired at the cave multiple times. Representatives of the headman known to settlers as \"Bill\" pressed for peace and of their innocence. Military officials concluded that this was the case. American colonists were held accountable for the outbreak of violence. Smith's decision to cease hostilities with Bill's people was unpopular with local American settlers. He was claimed to have left Americans \"wholly unprotected from the ruthless and murderous incursions of these savages...\"\n\nIn late April 1854 a group of miners found and killed 15 Shasta. These murders were committed in retaliation for some cattle having been stolen.\n\nIn May 1854 a Shasta man was accused of attempting to rape an American woman. A directive issued from Fort Jones called for the man to be captured and eventually presented to civil authorities in Yreka. Indian agent Rosborough informed representatives of Bill of the military order. The man accused of the rape attempt wasn't from Bill's band. Despite this Bill pushed for a guarantee that the man wouldn't be hanged. Fort Jones command insisted this wasn't possible. The commanding officer declared that if the man wasn't delivered soon all Shasta would be held responsible for his actions. A large party of \"De Chute\" natives (likely the Tenino) visiting the area were threatened to be employed in military reprisals against the Shasta. Dignitaries from the Irauitsu expressed support in capturing the man though they also didn't want him to be hung.\n\nThe accused Shasta was eventually presented to authorities in Yreka. As Fort Jones' commanding officer was absent from the area he was allowed to temporarily depart the town on the condition he remain in the area. A captain was eventually ordered to visit the nearby Shasta settlement where the man was then residing. Headman Bill and several Shasta accompanied the American officer. Upon reaching the village the man was collected. On 24 May while returning to Yreka the Shasta group was attacked on the Klamath River by a group of American settlers and \"De Chutes\". The American officer told the Shasta to flee while he attempted to talk the party down. The armed men refused to allow the Shasta to leave peaceably and shot at them. Two Shasta were killed instantly and three seriously injured. Headman Bill was among those wounded and struggled against being scalped by Americans. Eventually they succeeded in removing his scalp and threw him into the Klamath River while he remained alive. Lt. Bonnycastle decried the \"cowardly and brutal murder\" committed by the American settlers who apparently escaped unpunished for their actions.\n\nOn 17 May 1854 some Shasta warriors attacked a mule train in the Siskiyou Mountains. Two Americans were leading the mules. One was killed in the skirmish while the other man escaped to Cottonwood. Five horses and a mule taken by the Shasta.\n\nThe Irkirukatsu Shasta joined their Takelma neighbors in militarily resisting American territorial encroachment during the Rogue River Wars. Incoming colonists implemented agricultural operations across the Rogue Valley in 1852 and 1853. Open meadows became plowed and fenced into private farms. Oak forests were timbered for building supplies and additional agricultural land. Livestock such as pigs dug and ate the bulbs and roots to important flowering species.These practices quickly ruined many food sources for the indigenous of the region, including camas, acorns and seeds from a variety of grass species.\n\nA group of 150 to 300 Shasta gathered in the upper Rogue River basin in the winter of 1851 to 1852. Reportedly they had congregated to settle a dispute over a woman and were close to finishing negotiations. The American witness to the proceedings considered it largely a \"war expedition\". However the peaceable conclusion to the matter through material compensation followed traditional Shasta means of dispute resolution.\n\nIn early August 1853 a settler named Edwards residing near modern-day Phoenix was found slain in his cabin. Edwards' death incited a harsh response from American settlers. Militias were organized to begin indiscriminately attacking any natives in the Rogue River basin. About a month prior he had visited an Dakubetede settlement in the Applegate Valley and stole a Shasta slave. The abduction was tolerated by Americans and claims for compensation from the former slave owner were ignored. Contemporaries in Jacksonville considered this dispute to the cause of the murder. The Irkirukatsu Shasta were targeted in particular as they were considered particularly unwelcoming and aggressive against American colonists. They received help from some Klamath River Shasta who were expelled from their home territories by miners.\n\nEventually the Shasta and Takelma were pressed into accepting deportation from the Rogue Valley. American officials under Joel Palmer met with the leadership of the Irkirukatsu Shasta, \"Grave Creek Umpqua\" and the unrelated Shasta Costa on 18 November 1854. The \"Chasta Treaty\" was signed between the groups, although its terms were far from clear to the indigenous leaders. The fifth article stipulated that the Federal government was to fund and staff several facilities on the eventual reservation the Oregon Shasta and their neighbors were to be relocated to. This included a hospital, a schoolhouse, and two blacksmith shops.\n\nLife on the reservations was a challenging adjustment for the Shasta. The Grand Ronde in November 1856 had an estimated population of 1,025 natives, with 909 either Takelma or Shasta although this perhaps including some Shasta Costa or other natives of Southern Oregon. On 21 September 1857 a federal government official visited the Siletz Reservation. He estimated the Shasta and Takelma to number 544 there. The Superintendent Newsmith reported that some of the terms of the 1854 \"Chasta Treaty\" had yet to be implemented by 1858. Once relocated to the Siletz Reservation the promised blacksmiths, \"school teachers and medical officials had to be shared among all natives residing there, rather than just the signatories of the \"Chasta Treaty\".\n\n"}

Ellis began his diary in 1927 as a teenager and wrote for more than 70 years, nearly every day totaling a volume for each year.\n\nHe was believed to be the most prolific known diarist in the history of American letters; his diary is estimated to total 22 million words. He was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as having the world's longest diary, until the journals of Rev. Robert Shields, crammed with minutiae of daily living to the tune of 37.5 million words, were revealed in 1994.\n\nEllis authored books on the Great Depression and New York City, as well as a study of suicide. According to his book \"A Diary of the Century\", his diaries were bequeathed to the Fales Library at New York University after his death.\n\nEdward Robb Ellis was born in 1911 in Kewanee, Illinois. He began writing his diary in 1927 as part of a bet with two other young men as to who could keep up a journal the longest. He continued writing until his death in 1998.\n\nDetermined to be a reporter, Ellis attended the journalism program at the University of Missouri and in 1934 took his first job as a professional reporter for the New Orleans Associated Press office. In this position he covered the events of the Great Depression and the political career of Huey Long. After two years in New Orleans, he moved to Oklahoma City and became a journalist for the \"Oklahoma City Times\" covering New Deal offices and programs. As part of this position he reported on the Oklahoma Federal Symphony Orchestra, which was funded by the Works Progress Administration. Through this assignment Eddie met and fell in love with the principal violinist, Leatha Sparlin. They married in 1939 and moved to Peoria, Illinois where he worked for the \"Journal-Transcript\". The couple then moved to Chicago where Eddie worked for the \"Daily News\". Their daughter Sandra Gail Ellis was born on December 28, 1942.\n\nShortly after Sandra's birth, Ellis became aware that a previous diagnosis of a hernia was incorrect. He anticipated being drafted and consequently sought a commission in the navy. He was unable to receive one due to his low weight. As a result, he joined the navy and reported to training on November 7, 1942. Because diary keeping was prohibited in the armed forces he changed the format of the diary from private entries to letters to his wife and daughter. Ellis detested boot camp, upon finishing he was appointed editor of the navy hospital newspaper called \"The Bedside Examiner\". He used his position to publish editorials promoting enlisted people's rights as well as critiques of war. After basic training he was stationed in Okinawa where he continued to publish a newspaper, this time explicitly to improve the sailors' morale. Four months later the war ended and he returned to the United States. His wife requested a divorce, which he granted the following month and returned to work at the \"Daily News\" in Chicago.\n\nEllis did not fit in under the new management at the newspaper in Chicago however, and he soon left for New York to work at the \"World Telegram\". Ellis loved New York City deeply and would remain in the City for the rest of his life. There he met and married Ruth Kraus. They had an exceptionally happy marriage. After 15 years at the \"World Telegram\" Ellis quit after a disagreement with a city editor. He used his time unemployed to write several books, often with Ruth's help. Four of these books were published in his lifetime.\n\nRuth died suddenly of a heart attack in 1965. Eddie Ellis went on to have several extended romances, one with June Morgan and another with Selma Pezaro. Although Eddie was not a strong presence in his daughter's childhood, he and Sandy became close in her adulthood, writing numerous letters and challenging each other intellectually. He also forged mentoring relationships with other diarists, usually as a result of interviews and through the publication of parts of the diary in \"A Diary of the Century\".\n\nEllis was a contributor to \"Diarist's Journal\", a quarterly newspaper by, for and about diarists, published by Ed Gildea of Lansford, Pennsylvania. His reputation as a diarist led Letts of London to hire him as a consultant, and to create a diary modeled on his recommendations called \"The Ellis Diary.\"\n\nEllis' apartment on the third floor on W. 21st St. in Manhattan was filled with words—both his own and from other collected books and articles. It was difficult to move about, with books stacked randomly in high piles. That made Ellis laugh about his own lack of organizing skills, though he was happy to serve you a cup of tea and talk about whatever subject was in the air.\n\nThroughout his career as a reporter, Eddie Ellis interviewed numerous political and cultural celebrities including Eleanor Roosevelt, Irving Berlin, Grace Kelley and Herbert Hoover. The diary records his impressions of these famous personalities. Ellis was equally fascinated by the experiences and perceptions of ordinary people. He prided himself on his curiosity and eagerness to learn and considered himself what Shakespeare called \"a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\" The diary is a collection of those trifles and Eddie Ellis's attempt, as Pete Hamill writes in the introduction to \"A Diary of the Century\", \"to freeze time\" and reflect on himself and humanity.\n\nEdward Robb Ellis died in 1998 of emphysema.\n\n\n"}

Both primarily consisted of traditional songs and tunes and were later re-issued on a single CD under the title \"The Complete Brass Monkey\" (1993). They also guested on Loudon Wainwright III's 1986 album More Love Songs. Unable to reconcile the schedules of its various members, the band reluctantly broke up in 1987.\n\nIn 1997, the group reunited for a tour, and soon recorded a third album, \"Sound and Rumour\". This was followed by \"Going and Staying\" in 2001 on which both Williams and Cheetham appeared and \"Flame of Fire\" in 2004, which reverted to the original line-up.\n\nDespite Evans' death, in 2006 the band decided to continue, initially with a four-piece line-up who debuted with a short set at a Watersons family show at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 May 2007 before a short UK tour later in the same year and sporadic live shows during 2008. Later in 2008, the band recruited Paul Archibald to as their new trumpet player and debuted their new lineup at the Electric Theatre in Guildford on 15 March 2009. This line-up released a new CD \"Head of Steam\" on 20 April 2009.\n\nAll released on Topic Records unless otherwise noted.\n\n"}

It is within the boundaries of the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council area. Wauchope is inland on the Hastings River and the Oxley Highway west of Port Macquarie. The town is north of the state capital Sydney.\n\nWauchope is the location of Timbertown, a popular heritage theme park inspired by the logging industry that formed the basis for Wauchope's early economy and prosperity. The town has a population of approximately 7,500 (as of 2006 - including King Creek & Redbank). It has also played an important role in the Hastings Valley dairy industry.\n\nBy 1828 a number of land grants had been made along the Hastings River. It was not until 1836 that the village of Wauchope first came into existence. In that year Captain Robert Andrew Wauch (whose father dropped the 'ope' from the end of his name as a result of a family dispute) paid a deposit on on King Creek. He bought more property and built Wauch House.\n\nRobert Wauch died in the Macleay area in 1866, and the Government Gazette published the deeds of his properties, specifying that they should be called Wauchope. When the post office opened in a nearby settlement in 1881, it was named Wauchope, although the Government Gazette misprinted the name Wanghope, an error that was not corrected until 1889.\n\nIt is pronounced 'war-hope', although the family pronounced their name 'walk-op'. This is similar to the Canadian town which is pronounced 'walk-up'.\n\nThe largest recorded flood in the Hastings River at Wauchope occurred on 13 January 1968 and reached a peak level of above the Australian height datum (m AHD). The 1968 flood was estimated to be slightly rarer than a 100-year event.\nThe next largest flood was determined to be the flood of 5 to 7 March 1894. This flood reached a peak flood level of 8.9 m AHD at Wauchope.\n\nOther major floods occurred at Wauchope in February 1950 (8.45 m AHD), February 1929 (8.3 m AHD), August 1864 (8.2 m AHD), and June 1950 (8.1 m AHD).\n\nThe 1963 flood, which is notorious for the damage it caused in the lower reaches of the river, is only ranked as the eighth highest flood at Wauchope. It reached a peak level at Wauchope of 7.75 m AHD and was considered to be a 1 in 15-year event at Wauchope.\n\nOn 23 February 2013 floodwaters peaked at 7.22 m AHD at 7.30pm after heavy rainfall in the upper catchment area.\n\nWauchope's economy was traditionally based on the timber industry. At different stages in its history, more timber was transported out of Wauchope than out of any other town in Australia (via Wauchope railway station). Timber from Wauchope was used in the construction of the Sydney Opera House.\n\nIndustry in and around Wauchope has transformed primarily into farming and tourism. Increasingly, Wauchope and its surrounding villages and farms are becoming known for gourmet produce, including cheeses, wines and organic fruits and vegetables. The Hastings Farmers Markets are held at the Wauchope Showground on the 4th Saturday of every month and showcase a wide variety of local produce.\n\nTimbertown, the town's best-known tourist attraction, is a colonial-era themed village, which is located on the outskirts of Wauchope. It features static displays and attractions such as a working steam train, bullock team, and a Cobb and Co stage coach.\nThe Big Bull was a notable tourist attraction between Wauchope and Port Macquarie for twenty years, but was removed in 2007.\n\nOther important attractions include the historical society, historic buildings, Broken Bago vineyards and natural attractions including state forests and Bago Bluff National Park.\n\nWauchope railway station serves as an interchange for passengers travelling to nearby coastal centres such as Port Macquarie.\n\nThe township is set out along the southern bank of the Hastings River with the back drop of Bago Mountain further south.\n\nThe main street is High Street (a small section of the Oxley Highway), running generally westward through the town after coming east from Port Macquarie and across the North Coast railway line. The main street includes the Co-op general store (previously Parkers) and a number of smaller businesses and local bank branches. At the corner of Hastings Street is the local post office. Further up the main street is the town clock, a legacy of the days the town was the centre of the Hastings Shire local government area. Back along Hastings Street is the Co-op supermarket as well as the court house. In 2009 work commenced on the rebuilding of this supermarket. The old building was completely demolished and a much larger and more modern structure was completed and opened in 2010.\n\nThe main cross street is Cameron Street. The Hastings Hotel is on the south-east corner of Cameron and High and the Star Hotel is a short distance north. The RSL club is another north. Cameron Street leads to the Hastings River. A wharf was built at the northern end of Cameron Street for shipping produce downstream to Port Macquarie, but this no longer exists.\n\nTo the south of the main shopping area is the Wauchope Golf Course and Country Club, which occupies a premium site within the middle of the town. Further west is Timbertown, on the edge of large tracts of forestry land leading into the Bago Mountain area.\n\nTo the east of the main shopping area is the railway line from Sydney. The Hastings dairy and milk factory is located close to the point where the railway line crosses the Hastings River.\n\n\nWauchope has its own railway station on the North Coast Line of New South Wales. It is serviced by six NSW TrainLink trains per day 3 heading South (to Sydney), 3 heading further north to Grafton, Casino, and Brisbane. Passengers can alight at this station for connecting coaches to the nearby Port Macquarie.\n\n\nThe following city has been identified as a sister city of Wauchope by Sister Cities International:\n\n"}

They are the oldest and largest Dark Ages society in the UK. They are a founding member of the National Association of Re-enactment Societies. In its N.F.P.S days, the society consisted of some thirty core members, including the 'Odin Guard' an elite combat group maintaining Norse Heathen religious practices and values, but which eventually left the society during the leadership of Gerry East, whose recruitment tactics eventually took the membership into the three hundred plus bracket. The Society now has over 1100 members throughout Britain, Europe and North America. While the Society concentrates mainly on the 10th Century, events are often set in the wider period from 790 to 1066, with the appropriate modifications to dress and equipment used.\n\nDespite the 'Vikings!' title of the Society, the groups within it portray Saxon, Norman, Celtic, and Viking cultures.\n\nThe Vikings' goal is to provide an accurate and educational portrayal of the Viking period, with equal emphasis on the daily life of the period and on the more warlike aspects of life in what was a formative period in European history. Events staged by The Vikings aim for a high standard of presentation, historical accuracy and attention to detail. For combat displays, which combine public entertainment with a historical background, the battle organisers strive to recreate an event local to the area. Aside from the combat, at each event there are extensive living history displays which present a cross-section of life in the tenth century.\n\nThe Vikings has local groups in the UK, mainland Europe and Northern America, each group usually numbers between 5 and 50 members depending on the region. The groups are each led by a Sturaesman (or woman) or Jarl, who deals with the administrative and organisational aspects, and when at large events each will usually fight as one unit.\n\nAside from the main events, in many regions of the UK the society offers school visits by experienced and knowledgeable personnel in full period dress and equipment. These visits include a variety of activities based around the UK National Curriculum framework of Key Stage Two's “Invaders and Settlers” topic. \n\nThe Society also provides resources for schools, including a teacher's resource book for KS2. In some cases, clothing and equipment can be loaned to schools for short periods to assist in classroom work.\n\nAll visitors hold either a CRB disclosure to a minimum of standard level, or one from Disclosure Scotland.\n\nFull membership of The Vikings is open to anyone over the age of 18. In the UK, children aged 16 and 17 are allowed to train and participate in the combat displays when accompanied by an adult. Due to safety regulations, children under 16 years old may not take part in combat displays, although correctly dressed and equipped 13-15 year olds are used as battlefield runners and/or waterbearers.\n\nSince 1995, The Vikings has been the primary organiser for the combat and living history portions of the Battle of Hastings reenactment events.\n\n\n"}

Cremorne is located 6 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of North Sydney Council.\n\nCremorne Point shares the postcode of 2090 with Cremorne, a separate suburb to the north. Cremorne Point sits on Sydney Harbour between Shell Cove and Mosman Bay. Cremorne Junction is a locality within the suburb of Cremorne.\n\nCremorne was named after the Cremorne Gardens in London, a popular pleasure ground in England, which derives from Gaelic words meaning 'boundary' and 'chieftain'. Robertsons Point was named after James Robertson who was granted 35 hectares there in 1820. He was the father of Premier Sir John Robertson.\n\nWooloorigang / Cremorne Point and Mosman Bay were both once Cammeraygal territory named Wul-warra-Jeung before European settlement in Sydney Cove to their south. Aborigines called the waters east of the point Goram-Bullagong. In early European settlement after 1788, it became known as Careening Point and Mosman Cove became known as Hungry Bay. Careening Point commemorates HMS Sirius, a ship from the First Fleet of 1788, which was refurbished, pushed upstream in Mosman Bay.\n\nIn January 1822 Scot James Robertson, a watch maker, arrived on the \"Providence\" with wife and six children to become Supervisor of Governor Brisbane's astronomical instruments and clocks at his observatory in the Parramatta Domain. Brisbane was named \"founder\" of Australian science by Sir William Herschel, himself a noted astronomer and botanist who spent some time in South Africa. Robertson was granted a large amount of land on the Upper Hunter River and later in 1823 a further of Cremorne headland, where he built a Georgian house with fine cedar joinery. In its grounds were some fine pear trees. One of his sons became Sir John Robertson, NSW's fifth Premier - and premier five times.\n\nJames Milson Jnr (1814-1903), son of James Milson (1785-1872) who had owned much land in nearby Milsons Point, was a merchant and a pastoralist in NSW and Queensland. He expanded the family's land holdings in the lower North Shore, including the 1853 purchase of the Cremorne peninsula. The sale of this land for residential blocks in the last years of the 19th and early years of the 20th centuries proved to be especially profitable. Much to Milson's disgust, the courts prevented him from selling building blocks running right to the water's edge and Cremorne is consequently one of the few Sydney Harbour peninsulas with a public, waterfront park running around its edges. The last of the family's holdings in the lower North Shore area were resumed in the early 1920s for the construction of the Harbour Bridge and associated roadways.\n\nThe Rev. W. B. Clarke identified a coal seam running under much of Sydney and proposed it be mined. An experimental copper smelting industry was established in the mid-1840s on the eastern shore but was not successful and was removed by 1849.\n\nIn 1853 North Shore pioneer James Milson bought the land - Robertson's house became the Cremorne Hotel, later Cremorne House - and three years later leased to J. R. Clarke and Charles H. Woolcott, who planned Cremorne Gardens, named for the rather notorious Regency Pleasure Gardens in London. These opened in 1856 with and amusements galore. Steamers plied from Circular Quay and Woolloomooloo Bay every half hour until late. There were scenic walks - the Serpentine Walk and Italian Walk. Papers advertised \"a monster dancing stage, in circumference', an \"excellent (German) band, carousel, archery, quoits, rifle shooting, skittles, gymnastics, rifle gallery and refreshments\" at Sydney prices. Even a masked ball. At 8pm, magnificent fireworks, a la Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens (London) and splendid pyrotechny as in Cremorne Gardens, London. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" declared Cremorne to \"be ranked among the best of those places of holiday resort of a superior order which have recently sprung into existence in the neighbourhood of Sydney\". Anyone missing the last boat was compelled to remain behind overnight, as the bush was too thick to penetrate and few cared to swim back. By 1862 the place had an unsavoury reputation and the \"Gardens\" were in ruins.\n\nAround 1875 a white cask was moored just off Cremorne Point and used for target practice from Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Balls from the cannon would skim across the harbour ending up near Whiting Beach, near Taronga Zoo. The barrage would stop for the hourly steam ferry. In the 1880s and 1890s Cremorne Point was a more genteel Victorian Sunday destination.\n\nIn 1891 and 1893 Sydney Harbour Collieries Ltd. sank exploratory bores and discovered coal ten feet thick. Despite support from the Mines Department, the Lands Department refused permission to build coal wharves and the company found an alternative base in Balmain.\n\nIn 1905 a Harbour Foreshores Vigilance Committee formed and Cremorne Reserve was proclaimed later that year, with North Sydney Council as trustee. This was the culmination of a ten-year campaign to secure the area as public land. It reflected other campaigns for harbour foreshore reserves and conservation of that time. Magnificent harbour and city views were and remain available from here.\n\nThe McCallum Pool west of Cremorne Point was built in the 1920s as a pleasure pool for residents. As the threat of industrialisation subsided, others arose. Subdivision of the peninsula followed land reservation. By 1925 residential development encroached. While private gardens flourished, weeds and rubbish choked the foreshore reserve. Reports that \"respectable people\" didn't go there at night suggest it was sheltering the homeless or carousing couples after dark. North Sydney Council started a beautification campaign in the 1920s with local residents helping, transforming it by the 1930s. Several elements of that era survive - a concrete and chicken wire sign, archway etc. Then, perhaps due to the 1930s depression and World War 2, it sunk into neglect again.\n\nThe area attracted various architects including J. Burcham Clamp: his house \"The Laurels\" (1907, extended 1920) is a striking Arts & Crafts example. A 1927 issue of \"The Home\" magazine featured an Italian (Mediterranean revival) example - a house belonging to Mr F. C. Lane.\n\nInitially, access across the harbour was largely by being rowed by a privately hired watermen. Cremorne Point was included as a stop by privately operated ferry services to Mosman in the 1850s, however, these were discontinued due to lack of local residents. Old Cremorne Wharf on the east side of the point was included in regular services to Mosman and Neutral Bay that recommenced in 1872. Sydney Ferries Limited built a new wharf at Robertson Point in 1911 and added ferry services from Circular Quay on 18 December 1911 to meet a new tram service that also commenced that year. The Edwardian style wharf building burnt down in 1975. \n\nThe foreshore path from Neutral Bay to Cremorne Point wharf dates to 1830 when the reserve was retained by the Crown. Cremorne Point Reserve is the most substantial example in North Sydney of imposition of the (Harbour Foreshore) Reservation, applied from 1828.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census , there were 2,409 residents in Cremorne Point.\n\nCremorne Point ferry wharf is served by Mosman Bay services located on the peninsula's south-west. It was partially sunk in storms on 9 June 2007 and operational again on 15 September 2007.\n\nAt the 2016 Census, 33.8% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 46.2% by car (either as driver or as passenger).\n\n"}

A member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Sibylla became a Swedish princess by marrying Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, who did not live to ascend the Swedish throne.\n\nSibylla (then Sibylle) was born at Schloss Friedenstein on 18 January 1908 as the elder daughter and second child of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein, a daughter of Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, and descended from an older Scandinavian royal house. Through her father, she was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Her paternal grandfather was Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\nIn November 1931, Sibylla was in London to attend the wedding of her paternal first cousin Lady May Abel Smith as a bridesmaid. One of the other bridesmaids was her second cousin Princess Ingrid of Sweden, who introduced Sibylla to her brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten. Their engagement was announced at Callenberg Castle in Coburg 16 June 1932.\n\nThe wedding was celebrated in an official manner in Coburg, as President Hindenburg had ordered that no honours should be spared. However, as the city of Coburg was dominated by the Nazi party at the time, the celebrations there were Nazi influenced, which made a very bad impression in Sweden. The ceremony took place at St. Moriz. The couple spent their honeymoon in Italy before arriving in Stockholm on 25 November 1932.\n\nThe couple had five children:\n\n\nThe couple settled at Haga Palace, and their four daughters were to be commonly known during their childhood as the \"Hagaprinsessorna\" (English: \"The Haga Princesses\"). Sibylla shared her husband's enthusiasm for sport and outdoor activities, and the couple owned a cottage in Ingarö and another one in Storlien. Sibylla was also a keen supporter of the Swedish Girl Guides movement.\n\nDuring her lifetime, she was appointed chairman of various organisations such as Sällskapet Barnavård (English: \"The Childcare Society\") in 1948 and the honorary chairmanship of the Hörselfrämjandet (English: \"The Hearing Society\") in 1935; the Sveriges flickscoutråd (English: \"The Swedish Girls Scouts\") in 1939; Kvinnliga bilkåren (English: \"The Women's Automobile Force\") in 1939; the Stiftelsen Solstickan (English: \"The Solstickan Society\") in 1941; and the Stiftelsen Drottning Victorias Vilohem på Öland (English: \"The Queen Victoria Resting Home in Öland\") in 1951. In 1938, she founded the Prinsessan Sibyllas S:t Martin-stiftelse (English: \"The Princess Sibylla Foundation of St Martin\").\n\nSibylla became a widow in 1947 when Gustaf Adolf died in an airplane crash at the Copenhagen Airport in Denmark. Their only son, Carl Gustaf, became second-in-line to the throne at the age of nine months and, later, Crown Prince at the age of four. In 1950, Sibylla moved from Haga to the Royal Palace of Stockholm. During the summers, she stayed at Solliden. During these years, she developed an interest in environmental issues.\n\nAfter her stepmother-in-law, Queen Louise, died in 1965, Princess Sibylla became the highest ranking woman in the royal family. She took over her duties in support of her father-in-law, King Gustaf VI Adolf. During these years, she enjoyed somewhat more popularity, as she was more exposed, and as her humour and sense of self-irony became more known and appreciated. She continued with the so-called \"Democratic ladies lunches\" for career women instigated by Queen Louise in 1962 as a replacement for the court presentation.\n\nSibylla died in Stockholm of cancer less than a year before her son ascended to the throne.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2290281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290281", "title": "Ghost net", "text": "Ghost net\n\nGhost nets are fishing nets that have been left or lost in the ocean by fishermen. These nets, often nearly invisible in the dim light, can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open sea. They can entangle fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver. Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe.\n\nSome commercial fisherman use gillnets. These are suspended in the sea by flotation buoys, such as glass floats, along one edge. In this way they can form a vertical wall hundreds of metres long, where any fish within a certain size range can be caught. Normally these nets are collected by fishermen and the catch removed. \n\nIf this is not done, the net can continue to catch fish until the weight of the catch exceeds the buoyancy of the floats. The net then sinks, and the fish are devoured by bottom-dwelling crustaceans and other fish. Then the floats pull the net up again and the cycle continues. Given the high-quality synthetics that are used today, the destruction can continue for a long time.\n\nThe problem is not just nets but ghost gear in general; old-fashioned crab traps, without the required \"rot-out panel\", also sit on the bottom, where they become self-baiting traps that go on catching crabs year after year. Even balled-up fishing line can be deadly for a variety of creatures, including birds and marine mammals. Over time the nets become more and more tangled. In general, fish are less likely to be trapped in gear that has been down a long time.\n\nFishermen sometimes abandon worn-out nets because it is often the easiest way to get rid of them.\n\nThe French government offered a reward for ghost nets handed in to local coastguards along sections of the Normandy coast between 1980 and 1981. The project was abandoned when people vandalized nets to claim rewards, without retrieving anything at all from the shoreline or ocean.\n\nIn September 2015, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) was created by the World Animal Protection to give a unique and stronger voice to the cause.\n\nThe term ALDFG means \"abandoned or lost or discarded fishing gear\".\n\nFrom 2000 to 2012, the National Marine Fisheries Service reported an average of 11 large whales entangled in ghost nets every year along the US west coast. From 2002 to 2010, 870 nets were recovered in Washington (state) with over 32,000 marine animals trapped inside. Ghost gear is estimated to account for 10% (640,000 tonnes) of all marine litter.\n\nAn estimated 46% of the Great Pacific garbage patch consists of fishing related plastics.\n\nAccording to the SeaDoc Society, each ghost net kills $20,000 worth of Dungeness crab over 10 years. The Virginia Institute of Marine Science calculated that ghost crab pots capture 1.25 million blue crabs each year in the Chesapeake Bay alone.\n\nIn May 2016, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) recovered 10 tonnes of abandoned nets within the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone and Torres Strait protected zone perimeters. One protected turtle was rescued.\n\nUnlike synthetic fishing nets, biodegradable fishing nets decompose naturally under water after a certain period of time. Coconut fibre (coir) fishing nets are commercially made and are hence a practical solution that can be taken by fishermen.\n\nTechnology systems, for marking and tracking fishing gear, including GPS tracking, are being trailed to promote greater accountability and transparency.\n\nLegalizing gear retrievals and establishing waste management systems is required to manage and mitigate abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear at-sea. The company Net-works worked out a solution to turn discarded fishing nets into carpet tiles.\n\nSince 2008, the US Fishing for Energy initiative collected 2.8 million pounds of fishing gear, and in partnership with Covanta Energy turned this into enough electricity to power 182 homes for one year by incineration.\n\nA plan to protect UK seas from ghost fishing was backed by the European Parliament Fisheries Committee in 2018. Mr. Flack, who led the committee, said: \"Abandoned fishing nets are polluting our seas, wasting fishing stocks and indiscriminately killing whales, sea lions or even dolphins. The tragedy of ghost fishing must end.\n\nNet amnesty schemes such as Fishing for Litter incentivise the collection and responsible disposal of end of life fishing gear. These schemes address the root cause for many net abandonments which is the financial cost of their disposal.\n\nFishing nets are often made from extremely high quality plastics to ensure suitable strength, which makes them desirable for recycling. Initiatives like Healthy Seas are connecting environmental cleanup projects to manufacturers to re-use these materials. Brands such as Waterhaul and Econyl recycled waste nets into yarn and consumer products.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

He also served as a member of the Swedish parliament from 1967 to 1978.\n\nAhlmark was born in Stockholm, Sweden, as the son of the professor in medicine Axel Ahlmark and the dentist Gunvor Berglund. He completed upper secondary education at Södra Latin in Stockholm and earned a BA in political science from Stockholm University in 1964.\n\nAhlmark joined the Liberal Youth of Sweden in 1960 and was elected chairman of the organization the same year. He served as chairman of the Liberal Youth until 1962 and as a member of the board of the Liberal People's Party from 1960 to 1978. He was elected a member of the upper house of the Swedish parliament from 1967 to 1969 (representing the constituency of Örebro County) and as a member of the lower house from 1969 to 1970 (representing the constituency of Stockholm Municipality). Following the unicameral reform in Sweden in 1970/1971, Ahlmark served as a member of the unicameral parliament until 1978. He also served as a member of the Council of Europe from 1971 to 1976, and as deputy chairman of the Martin Luther King Fund from 1968 to 1973.\n\nOn 7 November 1975, Ahlmark succeeded Gunnar Helén as leader of the Liberal People's Party. from 1975 to 1978. From 1976 to 1978, in the first non-socialist government in Sweden in forty years, Ahlmark served as Minister for Employment and Deputy Prime Minister. On 7 March 1978, Ahlmark retired from party politics due to personal reasons. From 1978 to 1981 he served as chairman of the board of the Swedish Film Institute.\n\nAhlmark published several political books and many hundreds of articles about politics, literature and international conflicts. During the 1980s he published three books of poetry, one novel and two books of essays. He was a columnist for \"Expressen\", then the largest daily newspaper in Scandinavia, from 1961 to 1995. From 1997 to 2018 he was a columnist for \"Dagens Nyheter\", the largest Swedish morning paper, and a contributor to \"Göteborgs-Posten\". In his writings he accuses the political left in Sweden of being uncritical towards the totalitarian communist regimes especially after 1968.\n\nHe was a strong supporter of the state of Israel.

Eighty-eight people were killed as a result of the attacks, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were injured, making the attack the deadliest terrorist action in Egypt's history, until it was surpassed by the 2017 Sinai attack.\n\nThe attack took place on Egypt's Revolution Day, a public holiday in Egypt, and was part of a strategy of hurting Egypt's economy by disrupting tourism, a major industry.\n\nAfter the attacks, many arrests took place, especially of the Bedouin in the Sinai, who allegedly aided the attack, and Egypt started erecting a separation barrier around the city, cutting it off from possible attacks and the nearby Bedouin community.\n\nHistorically, foreign tourists have been a common target of attacks since the early 1990s. Militants have typically been motivated by a combination of Qutbism and opposition to the Mubarak government, and attacking foreigners including non-Muslims while hurting Egypt's tourist trade was seen as serving both goals.\n\nThe most bloody attack prior to the Sharm El Sheikh attacks was the November 1997 Luxor massacre, in which 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians died. The 2004 Sinai bombings killed 34 people in October in Taba, also on the Sinai Peninsula. In the April 2005 Cairo terrorist attacks three foreign tourists were killed.\n\nUnlike the October 2004 Taba attacks, the Sharm El Sheikh attack does not appear to have been directed in particular against Israelis, for whom Sharm is a popular destination. However, one Israeli Arab was killed and another was injured.\n\nThe attacks took place in the early morning, at a time when many tourists and locals were still out at restaurants, cafés and bars. The first bomb blast took place at 1:15 am Egypt summer time (22:15 UTC) at the Old Market bazaar in downtown Sharm El Sheikh, killing 17 people, mostly Egyptians. The bomber had to abandon his truck bomb in the market because of a police roadblock. The second bomb was a truck bomb that was driven into the lobby of the Ghazala Gardens hotel, a 176-room four-star establishment in the Naama Bay area, a strip of beachfront hotels some 6 km from the town centre. About 45 people died in the blast. The final bomb was hidden in a suitcase and exploded outside the Moevenpick Hotel, killing six tourists.\n\nThe blasts were powerful, shaking windows miles away. Fire and smoke could be seen rising from the explosion sites.\n\nThe official government toll a few days after the attacks was put at 64, but hospitals reported that 88 people had been killed. The majority of dead and injured were Egyptians. Among those killed were 11 Britons, two Germans, six Italians, four Turks, one Czech, one Israeli, and one American. Other casualties, dead and injured, included foreign visitors from France, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Qatar, Russia, and Spain. Dr. François Boureau, a medical doctor from Paris, who was a world-famous pioneering expert in providing relief to chronic pain patients, also died on 23 July 2005 in the Sharm El Sheik area, presumably in these terrible attacks.\n\nA group calling itself the Abdullah Azzam Brigades was the first to claim responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that \"holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm El Sheikh\" and claimed it has ties to Al-Qaeda.\n\nThe Egyptian government said that the bombers were Bedouin militants from the same group that carried out the 2004 Sinai bombings in Taba. Arrested suspects claimed to have been motivated by the War in Iraq.\n\nOn 5 March 2011, Egyptian protesters stormed the headquarters of the secret police in Cairo. On 7 March 2011, Kuwaiti paper Al-Jarida reported former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak' son Gamal and Egypt's former interior minister Habib el-Adly ordered the deadly bombings of the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh citing classified documents from the raid.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2290309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290309", "title": "Gofio", "text": "Gofio\n\nGofio is a sort of Canarian flour made from roasted grains (typically wheat or certain varieties of maize) or other starchy plants (e.g. beans and, historically, fern root), some varieties containing a little added salt. Gofio has been an important ingredient in Canarian cooking for some time, and Canarian emigrants have spread its use to the Caribbean (notably in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela) and the Western Sahara. It is also found in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, where it is known as \"harina tostada\" and is employed in a wide variety of recipes. The gofio commercially available in the Canary Islands is always finely ground, like ordinary flour, despite the definition given in the Spanish \"Dictionary of the Royal Academy\".\n\nGofio is thought to have been the main staple of the diet of the Guanches, the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands, who produced it from barley and the rhizome of certain ferns. The latter is also known to have been used in historical times, especially in famine, even up until the 20th century. Gofio derives from the name for the product in the aboriginal language of Gran Canaria, while in neighbouring Tenerife it was known as \"ahoren\". Among the Berbers of North Africa, from whom the Guanche population largely derived, there existed a toasted barley flour with similar usage as a food, called \"arkul\". In Morocco, toasted flour is also mixed with, among other ingredients, almond paste, honey, argan oil, anise, fennel, and sesame seeds to make \"sellou\" (also called \"zamita\" or \"slilou\" in some regions), a sweet paste known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value. It was amongst the provisions of the crew of Thor Heyerdahl's \"Ra II\" expedition to cross the Atlantic aboard a papyrus ship using the Canary Current in 1970.\n\nFlours made from toasted grains are also known in other gastronomies worldwide, notably Tibetan \"tsampa\". Roasting the grain before milling has the advantage of destroying mold and mold toxins, allowing poorly stored grain to be used, as well as improving flavour by producing more complex sugars. The traditional roasting process, at temperatures typically much higher than those used for malt barley in the brewing industry, for example, also has the effect of partly breaking down the starch and proteins, making them more digestible. \nGofio with milk, sugar and water is a very popular beverage in Western Sahara, due to Spanish influence and the proximity of the Canary Islands.\n\nGofio in the Canary Islands is currently produced from cereals of several types, as well as pulses. Maize and wheat are the most common cereals used, but various mixes of these with rye, barley, etc., are also readily available in shops. Gofios of chickpeas and lupin beans are also produced in Fuerteventura, as well as from other wild plants occurring there.\n\nGofio is a highly versatile product which can be added to soups, stews, desserts, ice cream, sauces, and more. It is very rich in vitamins, proteins, fibre, and minerals. It was favoured by Canarian mariners as it can be stored for long periods while retaining its goodness. It was a vitally important part of the Canarian diet during the lean years after the Spanish Civil War. Mixed with a little water and sugar and kneaded (traditionally inside a goatskin bag) it produces a dough-like mixture that can be eaten as it is and was traditionally used in this way by peasant workers in the fields. Perhaps the most common use today is to add to a small amount to milk, to produce a wholesome and convenient breakfast food, or to thicken soups or stews at the table. Another popular form is \"gofio escaldado\" (\"scalded gofio\") or \"escaldón\", a kind of thick porridge made by mixing it with the stock from a stew or soup, which is then served alongside the same. Modern products incorporating gofio include ice cream, mousses, other milk desserts and even a beer, Volcan, which was marketed for only a short time around the year 2000.\n\nIn the Caribbean, gofio is a snack eaten as it is. In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, gofio is sold with sugar added, as a candy, sometimes served in a paper cone.\n\nAboriginals of Argentina and Chile have used a preparation of maize made by the same method of making gofio since before the arrival of the Spaniards. The preparation of gofio in other regions of South America and the Caribbean has come due to Canarian arrival. Gofio is consumed dry with sugar or with milk in Argentina, Chile, Panama, Venezuela, Uruguay and many other countries.\n\n"}

Its scenario was written by Nagihiro Asama, based on the concept by Yoshio Sakamoto. Kenji Yamamoto composed the game music. The popularity of \"Part I: Kieta Kōkeisha\" prompted the release of this sequel, which employed the similar graphic-adventure gameplay. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Power cartridge rewriting service in 1998 with improved graphics and sound, and the Disk System version was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini series. The murder and smoking scenes resulted in a CERO (ages 15+) rating for the GBA release, making it the first Nintendo title to receive a parental advisory rating.\n\nThe objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.\n\nThe game's narrative presumably takes place in modern day Japan. Most of the story takes place in a suburban town, where Ushimitsu High School is located. Nearby is a downtown galleria, housing a subway station, a nightclub, and a bar; the player will also reach the \"Sambora Bar & Saloon\" at a nearby town, contactable in the game by the phone number \"007-1234\". Ryoko's house is in this same town. Yoko's house and Tazaki's and Goro's apartments are also visited as well. The past Kaneda residence and snack bar were in this same town as well. When the protagonist needs to search for Ayumi, he will need to visit Tazaki's mother's small fishing village of Marufuku.\n\nThe prologue scene depicts an autumn night \"3 years ago\"—a 15-year-old boy (the protagonist of the game) on the run from two police officers. A man, respected by the police, decides to care of the situation by himself. The man takes the boy to a coffeehouse; the boy ran away from his orphanage to find his parents' whereabouts. The man, a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, convinces him to become his assistant.\n\nA cutscene tells that \"a few months later\", Utsugi and the protagonist receive a phone call to check over a crime scene; this starts Chapter 1. The victim is a freshman schoolgirl named Yoko Kojima. Her time of death is estimated to be around 9-10 PM on October 10. Throughout Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3, the protagonist will need to gather information from Ushimitsu High School to solve the Yoko case, and connect it with the Genjiro Kaneda case. Yoko was deep into an investigation of \"The Tale of the Girl in Back\"; this rumor involves a ghost of a blood-soaked girl that stands behind a student.\n\nThe \"Girl in Back\" story originated 15 years ago, when a schoolgirl of Ushimitsu, Shinobu Asakawa went missing. This was around the same time of the murder of Genjiro Kaneda; that case's statute of limitations was going to expire soon. In Chapter 4, the player will learn more background about the ghost story. Ms. Hayama, a teacher at the school, admits to the protagonist that she started the rumor. On the night of the Kaneda murder, the then sophomore went to the school to get some forgotten homework, but saw the \"Girl in Back\".\n\nIn Chapter 5, Hayama confirms passing by the old school building during the night she saw the \"Girl in Back\", but the wall was unfinished. During the conversation, the protagonist catches Tazaki eavesdropping. He tries to chase him down, but fails. After he returns to the detective agency, Ayumi gives him a cup of coffee that makes him go unconscious. As this happens, the game flashes back to the previous events.\n\nWhen he gains his consciousness in Chapter 6, he realizes Ayumi drugged his coffee; a letter from Ayumi says she went to track down Tazaki herself. The game then depicts him searching through a town, and ending up in a downtown galleria. Eventually, he ends up from Tazaki's apartment, to his mother's village, and finally down a cliff, where Ayumi is kept hostage by an unstable Tazaki. He threatens to kill her, but gives up afterward. He confesses about his false alibi and talks of his past. In Chapter 7, the protagonist has the altruistic Urabe admit he lied about Tazaki's alibi, but he showed no regrets. The protagonist will find that many students and teachers - particularly Mr. Hibino - respect Urabe as a fine educator.\n\nChapter 8 and Chapter 9 provide background information for Shinobu, Urabe, and Goro. The protagonist notices a portrait of Shinobu in the school; the painter, Ryoko Katsuragi, tells the protagonist about Shinobu's personality. Yoko and Shinobu were also cousins. When the protagonist arrives at Goro's apartment, the game presents a scene of Goro getting murdered. The protagonist realizes that Goro was the man Urabe hanged out with at the galleria. He was holding a pen with the initials \"T.U.\"; these match the initials of Teruhiko Uchida and Tadashi Urabe.\n\nChapter 10 elaborates more on Shinobu's friend, whose last name was Uchida. Sayaka Ishibashi tells the protagonist that the Uchida boy was indeed Teruhiko's son, Tatsuya. This boy later turns out to be Tatsuya Hibino. Hibino tells the protagonist about how he developed his father-son relationship with Urabe. He also shows his extreme resentment towards the Kanedas. He has no alibi for the Goro murder, but throws a temper tantrum when the protagonist considers Urabe a suspect.\n\nChapter 11 makes up the final chapter of the game's narrative. Conversing with Hayama, the protagonist realizes Urabe was never on any business trip, as he claimed before. When she went to school on the night of the Kaneda murder, through the window of the old school building did she see the bloody girl - this was likely Shinobu. Tazaki reveals that on that night he was indeed plastering the wall of the old school building, but he took a break. The next morning, it looked like someone had used his tools.\n\nBack at the detective agency, a resentful tipster calls to tell that the \"lowlife\" was at the school. Ayumi was taking a make-up test for Hibino before they went outside to meet the protagonist. The three break through the door into Urabe's office, and the player is shown a visual of the suicided Urabe. Urabe had left a suicide letter; on it, he shamefully confesses as the serial killer.\n\nThe next scene reveals the shattered Hibino as the serial killer. During flashback cutscenes, Hibino makes detailed confessions of his murders. After confessing about Genjiro, Shinobu, Goro, and Yoko, he tries to slash the cornered protagonist and Ayumi in the hallway with the giant mirror. Instead, he ends up stabbing the mirror and shattering it into pieces. It reveals the corpse of Shinobu; as police, Maruyama, and Utsugi arrive, Ayumi faints.\n\nAfter the climactic revelations, the game cuts back to the agency; Utsugi and the protagonist discuss their findings. Afterwards, Utsugi introduces Ayumi as an official assistant of his. When the protagonist asks Utsugi about the \"T.U.\" pen, he does not answer why it didn't read \"T.H.\" instead - but he and Ayumi go out to eat, leaving the protagonist behind. The screen cuts to black, and it is revealed that Hibino was Urabe's son all along - having lost his wife after she gave birth to Hibino, Urabe entrusted his son to his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Uchida. The \"T.U.\" initials on the pen are then revealed to be directed not to Tatsuya Hibino, but to Tatsuya Urabe, his son.\n\nAfter the credits roll, the game goes into its epilogue, \"two years later.\" Zenzou Tanabe calls the Utsugi Detective Agency over to his Myojin Village. The protagonist goes out to the village, while leaving behind Ayumi. The game's plot would continue into ; this game is chronologically a prequel to the first game in the series.\n\nThis ghost story circulates in Ushimitsu High School; it serves as the primary plot device in the game (along with the two cases investigated), and the game's subtitle derives from this. It originates \"15 years ago\", when the then schoolgirl Hayama saw a bloody girl - Shinobu Asakawa - through a window of the old schoolhouse. The Girl in Back haunts a student by calling him/her from behind, presenting herself to the haunting victim as a girl completely covered in blood. A variation of this story tells that she first calls a student behind; after the victim searches, he/she will find the Girl in Back in front of him/her. One version of the story says she appears in hallways; another version says she appears in bathrooms.\n\nThe original Disk System version was released in two separate Disk Cards, released separately from each other. Its music was composed by Kenji Yamamoto, who composed sound and music for \"Super Metroid\" and for \"\". It utilizes the FDS's extra sound channel for the music.\n\nThe SFC remake had improved graphics - directed by Tomoyoshi Yamane, object and Samus designer for \"Super Metroid\" and designer for \"Wario Land 4\" and \"\"; the remake's music was yet again composed by Kenji Yamamoto. Since the SFC version is on a cartridge instead of a Disk Card, it avoids the load times when saving games and switching between scenes. The SFC version utilized the SFC's 8-channel Sony SPC700, which had more channels than the Famicom's 5-channel Ricoh 2A03 and the FDS's channel together. The SFC version generally had extended remixes all of the original version's songs, and a few extra songs. The game uses either waveforms or white noise to \"voice\" the characters. The FDS version's voice waveforms are all the same frequency square waves, but in the SFC version, each character is designated to one of a number of different voice waveforms. In the original FDS version, for the protagonist's search for Ayumi, the game required the player to manually go through the town as a pseudo-3D maze; the SFC version had this trimmed down to just text and visual descriptions.\n\nThe SFC version adds a \"memo\" interface that the player can access throughout most of the game. It can be used to look up information on most of the characters (except the protagonist himself, Utsugi, Maruyama, Fumi Tazaki, and all unnamed characters). At some points, the memo's interface is used to fill in question blanks with the names of the correct characters. The memo is also utilized during most \"Review\" sessions, where the protagonist reviews on what new information he discovered so far. This version also has a \"logbook\" feature, which summarizes all story and information gathered so far in a save file.\n\nThe SFC remake adds an extra, final part to the ending - a personality assessment for the entertainment of the player, based on the player's actions and patterns. For example, analyzing or touching Yoko's skirt could have the game assume a flirtatious personality. In addition, based on how the character treats Ayumi, the game will determine the protagonist's \"compatibility\" with Ayumi, out of 20 hearts. Actions with Ayumi and other schoolgirl characters would be used to select whom to match with the protagonist - this includes the art club member, a flirtatious schoolgirl, and Ayumi herself.\n\nFor the SFC version, all of the scenes were redrawn, and some were extended into multiple drawings. Unlike the FDS version's art, directed by Tetsuji Tanaka, the remake uses the SFC's graphical capabilities to execute cinematic techniques, including scrolling, transparency, stylistic, and fading effects. In addition, the SFC versions adds close-ups of characters during specific scenes; examples of this enhancement include Tazaki's holding Ayumi hostage and Hibino's temper tantrum. Flashback sequences are given more detail - for example, the cutscene of Hayama's account of the Girl in Back shows a younger Hayama and the background of the school behind her. Other stylistic changes in the artwork include a blue silhouette of the Girl in Back during a cutscene about the ghost and the sketched style of one of the ending screens. In the original FDS version, some of the anonymous characters cannot be seen; however, the SFC version provides visuals of nearly all anonymous characters the protagonist encounters.\n\n\"Ayumi Tachibana\" appears as a collectible trophy in the GameCube title, \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\". The game includes a short paragraph explaining that she first appeared in \"Famicom Tantei Club Part II\", which her first appearance was actually in \"\". It also claims that she solved the murder of \"one of her friends\" (Yoko) in the first installment, but that was in the \"second\" installment, not the first. Contrary to what the description says, Ayumi never opened her own detective agency; at the most, her backstory tells that she opened a school detective club with Yoko, and she becomes an assistant of Utsugi's agency.\n\nIn September 2019, a remake was announced for a 2020 release on the Nintendo Switch, with Mages developing it.\n\n"}

It is regarded as the best game on the Virtual Boy, with some critics wanting to see it re-released for other systems to allow more people to play. It served as an inspiration for multiple games due to its background gimmick, including \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\" and \"Mutant Mudds\".\n\n\"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" stars Wario on a quest to find treasure in the Awazon. Gameplay involves techniques such as jumping, charging, and throwing enemies and objects. The levels he explores are viewed from a sidescrolling perspective He has the ability to jump into the background at special blocks. Similarly to \"\", featuring the ability to equip hats to gain new powers, which he loses if he takes damage or dies. These hats include an eagle hat that allows Wario to charge horizontally in mid-air, a dragon hat that breathes fire, and a bull hat that increases his power and adds horns. He can obtain a hat with all three abilities called the King Dragon Hat. In each stage, Wario must collect treasure and find a key to unlock the elevator to the next stage. Players can find different treasures hidden around the stages to increase their overall score. There are also mini-games in between stages in which Wario can gamble with the loot he has collected so far. Players fight bosses on occasion, which make use of the game's background gimmick.\n\n\"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and published by Nintendo. The game was originally named \"Wario Cruise\", appearing with the name on the Virtual Boy system's box and in a \"Nintendo Power\" issue. Its development had a large allocation of R&D1's staff involved. The music and sound effects were composed by Kazumi Totaka, who ended his work with R&D1 with it. Totaka includes a song called \"Totaka's Song\", which he hides in most video games he composes. Like all other Virtual Boy games, \"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick used to simulate 3D. It was released on December 1, 1995 in Japan and November 27, 1995 in North America.\n\nUpon release, \"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" had mixed reviews. \"Next Generation\" felt that while it had appeal to more \"hardcore\" \"Mario\" fans, it was not very advanced in comparison to older \"Mario\" games, particularly noting that the 3D mechanics did not affect gameplay much. \"Rocky Mountain News\" felt that its use of 3D demonstrated the Virtual Boy's possibilities. \"Los Angeles Times\" found the game enjoyable, but did not like the Virtual Boy's visual style. \"GamePro\" praised it for its sound effects and character sprite quality, calling it the best of the platform.\n\nRetrospective criticism for \"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" has been more favorable. It has been named as one of the best games on the Virtual Boy by \"Nintendo Power\", GamesRadar, and Retronauts, the latter which noted that it should be remade for a different platform. Websites such as Destructoid and IGN hoped that it would be re-released on the Nintendo 3DS, while Kotaku felt that it was unappreciated back when it was released due to its platform. AllGame felt that it was a good demonstration of the Virtual Boy's gimmicks and enjoyed its gameplay, while \"Retrogamer\" felt that the background gimmick helped enhance an otherwise \"traditional\" platformer. While Nintendo World Report enjoyed the background gimmick, they felt it did not do as well as it could to explore the concept. ABC Good Game also felt that it could have done more with its visuals, nonetheless calling it the best Virtual Boy game. 1UP.com felt that it served as a demonstration of what a \"traditional\" game could look like with the 3D gimmicks. GameZone felt that its cavernous setting helped the Virtual Boy emphasize subtle visual details, considering it worth buying a Virtual Boy for this game. \"Play Magazine\" returned to play \"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" often, praising it for not getting tiresome to play.\n\nThe background gimmick served as inspiration for multiple developers, including Retro Studios in the 2010 Wii game \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\" and Jool Watsham in the 2011 3DS game \"Mutant Mudds\".\n\n"}

Raika, who has suffered a broken nose and an eye socket fracture in fights, shrugs off the possibility of injuries.\n\"When I told friends that I want to become a boxer, they were surprised and put down my decision because I am a woman,\" said Raika. \"But I had to resist. I like boxing and I wanted to do it. In fact, I am expressing myself through boxing. I am fighting not to beat the opponent, but for myself.\"\n\nRaika lived with her grandmother until she was three. After her grandmother died, she spent the next 15 years in the Karyo-en children's home in Kyoto. Raika was a good student, among the top of her high school graduating class. She studied at Ogaki Women's College and became a licensed dental hygienist, later working at a dental clinic. She quit the job after a month, because she did not like the uniform. She tried other jobs, but they did not make her happy.\n\n\"I felt as if I were not living and felt myself destroying.\" said Raika, \"I was very weak mentally. I could choose to have an ordinary life, but I wanted more than just that - to become strong.\"\n\nAlways enjoying rough sports such as wrestling and rugby, Raika joined a local boxing gym that she found while commuting to work at a battery manufacture, and trained to compete as an amateur boxer.\n\nRaika had three wins in three amateur fights, and was named the most outstanding woman in a local amateur tournament, where she was spotted by Toshihiro Yamaki, a Tokyo gym owner.\n\nWith a growing number of Japanese women becoming interested in boxing, a group of gym owners had organized a women's boxing association in 1999, with Yamaki as its secretary general, called the Japanese Women's Boxing Commission (JWBC).\n\nYamaki was impressed by Raika, and asked her to join his gym and turn professional. She now devotes full-time to boxing.\n\nRaika won the WIBA Featherweight World title from Australian Sharon Anyos in 2001, and successfully defended the title in a 2002 rematch. After destroying an overmatched Shelby Walker in two rounds for her second title defence on May 23, 2004, Raika made her 3rd title defence against the rugged (and undefeated) brawler Melissa Fiorentino on September 18, 2004, in Kyoto, Japan. It was called the WIBA 2004 Fight of the Year, Raika again successfully defended her crown via 10 round decision in a brutal toe-to-toe slugfest.\n\nRaika then vacated her world title at featherweight (126 pounds) to move up in weight to the super featherweight division (130 pounds).\n\nOn March 13, 2005, in Tokyo, Japan, Raika lost a 10 round decision to Chevelle Hallback for the vacant WIBA Super Featherweight World Title.\n\nOn October 1, 2005, in Tokyo, Japan, Raika won an 8 round decision over Belinda Laracuente.\n\nOn May 20, 2006, in Cholla Province, Korea, Raika moved up another 2 weight classes, to 140 pounds, where she won a 10 round unanimous decision over Won Mi Chung, for the IFBA Light Welterweight World Title.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, in Tokyo, Japan, Raika knocked out Yoko Takahashi in the 4th round with a body shot.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, in Tokyo, Japan, Raika won a 10 round unanimous decision over Terri Blair to win the vacant WIBA Lightweight World Title.\n\n"}

Streleski was in his 19th year pursuing his doctorate in the mathematics department, alternating with low-paying jobs to support himself.\n\nDuring his trial Streleski told the court he felt the murder was \"logically and morally correct\" and \"a political statement\" about the department's treatment of its graduate students, and he forced his court-appointed lawyer to enter a plea of \"not guilty\" rather than \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" as the lawyer had urged.

{"id": "2290374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290374", "title": "Tatjana Patitz", "text": "Tatjana Patitz\n\nTatjana Patitz (born 25 May 1966) is a German model and actress who achieved international prominence in the 1980s and 1990s representing fashion designers on runways and in magazines such as \"Elle\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and \"Vogue\". Patitz is one of the \"big five\" supermodels who appeared in the 1990 music video \"Freedom! '90\" by George Michael, and is associated with the editorial, advertising, and fine-art works of photographers Herb Ritts and Peter Lindbergh.\n\nIn his 2015 book \"Models of Influence: 50 Women Who Reset The Course of Fashion\", Nigel Barker reflected on Patitz's modeling career during the height of the supermodel era in the 1980s and 1990s, writing that Patitz possessed an exoticism and broad emotional range that set her apart from her peers. In her 2012 memoir, creative director of \"Vogue\" Grace Coddington regarded Patitz as one of the original supermodels and a must in photographs and on the catwalk. \"Harper's Bazaar\" wrote, \"Indeed, Patitz's features almost confuse. Like Garbo or the Mona Lisa, the inexplicable gifts of line and luminescence defy definition.\" \"Vogue\" editor-in-chief Anna Wintour stated that Patitz had always been one of her favorite models. Patitz's work bridged the eras of the exhibitionist 1980s and the minimalist 1990s in an enduring way, as Barker concluded, \"The most lasting images of her are when she was really looking like herself.\"\n\nToday, Patitz is an avid horsewoman who continues her lifelong passion for animals and the environment by campaigning for ecological causes and animal rights. Her self-described eclectic and bohemian design aesthetic for residential architecture and home design in her adoptive home state of California has been recognized internationally.\n\nPatitz was born in Hamburg, Germany and raised in Skanör, Sweden. She learned to ride horses at the age of seven. During the summers, she found respite at her family's summer vacation home in Mallorca, where she participated in horse camps.\n\nIn 1983 at the age of 17, Patitz entered and became a finalist in the Elite Model Look (formerly known as Elite Models' \"Look of the Year\" contest), and based on a Polaroid, she was placed third by Elite Model Management founder John Casablancas. Patitz won a contract and moved to Paris to begin working as a model. Though not an immediate success, by 1985, Patitz worked regularly and at the end of that year, she modelled for the cover of British \"Vogue\", her first major cover.\n\nThat year she began to work with photographer Peter Lindbergh with whom she cultivated a 30-year collaborative relationship which contributed to the launch of the supermodel era. In his book, \"10 Women\", Lindbergh wrote, \"I admire Tatjana because she always stays herself. She's very soft, but at the same time she's very strong and knows how to stand up for what she thinks, and it's always very enriching to be with her. It's impossible not to admire her and over the years not to be just a little bit in love with her.\n\nPatitz's work in Europe led her to New York where she worked for \"Vogue\" and such photographers as Irving Penn, Helmut Newton, Steven Meisel, Denis Piel, Sheila Metzner, and Wayne Maser. She also worked with Gilles Bensimon at \"Elle\" and Francesco Scavullo at \"Cosmopolitan\".\n\nThe December 1985 issue of \"Vogue\" featured Irving Penn's photograph, \"Colored Contact Lenses\", showing Patitz wearing contact lenses over closed eyelids. The image would later be featured in the 1992 book \"On The Edge: Images from 100 Years of Vogue\" as one of the iconic photographs of the era.\n\nIn 1986, she appeared on two covers of the Italian edition of \"Vogue\" and continued to be featured in editorials in the American and British editions of \"Vogue\". Patitz appeared in campaigns for Calvin Klein photographed by Bruce Weber, and in 1987 for Revlon's \"The Most Unforgettable Women in the World\" campaign photographed by Richard Avedon. Avedon also photographed Patitz for her first cover of American \"Vogue\" (May 1987), which is regarded as one of the definitive covers of the 1980s. \"Vogue\" began regularly including Patitz's name on the pages of fashion editorials as early as 1987, familiarizing readers not only with her face, but also with her personality.\n\nDuring this period, Patitz met Los Angeles-based photographer Herb Ritts, with whom she shared another significant and enduring collaboration in fashion, fine art, and commercial work, like a muse playing any role he suggested - mermaid, sprite, surfer girl, plainswoman, movie star. Ritts said of Patitz, \"Her features are a bit off; she's not a typical, commercial beauty, but when I shoot her, I'm never bored. Her looks have power, strength, intensity.\" Patitz was the subject of his work Tatjana Veiled Head (Tight View), Joshua Tree 1988.\n\nAs the decade progressed, Patitz's career escalated and she was credited with expanding ideals of female beauty. Patitz and a select group of individual-looking, business-minded, high-profile fashion models emerged and came to be known as the original supermodels. A photograph showing Patitz with them laughing on the beach was taken by Peter Lindbergh for \"Vogue\" during this period. Simply titled \"White Cotton Shirts\", the image, now regarded as an iconic fashion photograph, was accompanied by an article that singled out Patitz for her \"astonishing presence\", praising her \"uncosmeticised womanliness, new and important in the 1980s.\"\n\nIn another 1988 \"Vogue\" article titled \"Tatjana: Million Dollar Beauty\", Patitz's creative team shared their impressions of her: \"In pictures, her sensitivity is what comes through; something delicate, fragile, exciting. It's a strange mixture of lazy sensuality and moments of intense emotion,\" said John Casablancas, president of Elite Model Management. \"It's hard to get a bad picture of Tatjana. She's very photogenic, which is very rare, and she looks different in every light,\" added photographer Patrick Demarchelier. \"While some models develop one look, she has many.\"\n\nHer versatility was exemplified by the changing of her hair color and style with each passing year during the late 1980s, from short-haired brunette to tawny mane to long and blond. For an April 1989 editorial titled \"Earthly Powers\" in British \"Vogue\", hair stylist Didier Malige cut and restyled Patitz's foot-long blonde hair into a cropped shag just above her shoulders. \"Once I cut my hair - I cried for two months,\" Patitz told Esquire magazine. \"People said, 'We can't believe she cut her hair.'\" But the move won Patitz covers of British and French editions of Vogue featuring her new look. The pinnacle of that year came in July and August when Patitz was awarded with consecutive covers of US Vogue - two months in a row. It was an unprecedented achievement for a model of that time and an innovation for the recently revamped Vogue under the leadership of new editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. This period was the zenith of Patitz's career, known as \"the era of Tatjana\" in the fashion industry - a whirlwind time when she seemed destined to walk away with the title of supermodel herself.\n\nDuring this period, in an effort to live a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, Patitz began slowing down her modeling career to focus on other creative pursuits such as writing, acting, and meditation. She relocated to California and made Los Angeles her homebase. The move afforded Patitz, who had always searched for creative and spiritual growth, the time and space to develop other aspects of her life.\n\nIn the final months of 1989, Patitz was photographed with other top models in two portraits that would become key images of the supermodel era of the 1990s: \"Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood, 1989\" by Herb Ritts; and Peter Lindbergh's cover of the January 1990 issue of British \"Vogue\".\n\nThe decade began with Patitz on the January covers of both the American and British editions of\" Vogue\". She shared the British \"Vogue\" cover with Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington; the portrait of the five women is regarded as the cover that sparked the supermodel phenomenon of the 1990s, helping each woman attain global appeal. Photographed by Peter Lindbergh, the cover inspired pop star George Michael to cast Patitz, Crawford, Evangelista, Turlington and Campbell in his music video for the song \"Freedom! '90\" which was directed by David Fincher. Michael did not appear in the video; instead, each woman would lip-synch the song in Michael's place. Patitz and her co-stars were already top stars in the fashion world but were now gaining major recognition for their beauty and charisma outside of it too. The music video was programmed into heavy rotation on MTV, going on to transcend the worlds of pop culture, music, and fashion in the 1990s and remaining influential in the decades to come.\n\nSettled in Los Angeles, Patitz continued to manage her modeling career while studying acting. She work mostly with Ritts, Lindbergh and Maser but was sought after by the industry's leading female photographers such as Peggy Sirota, Ellen Von Unwerth, Pamela Hanson and Sheila Metzner as well as new photographers such as Mario Sorrenti and Juergen Teller. Los Angeles-based photographers Phillip Dixon and Matthew Rolston also frequently photographed Patitz for Harper's Bazaar. Rolston said of Patitz: \"I look for more than beauty. There must be a memorable quality. Tatjana has it more than anyone else. She sticks in your mind. There's a depth, an emotional quality to her that's truly extraordinary. She's very dear, charming and extremely feminine. She's very open and her priorities are natural things - animals, the sea, the environment. That's what's so interesting about her. She's not what she seems.\"\n\nAs the decade progressed, Patitz continued to work in advertising campaigns and on runways for such top fashion houses as Chanel, Versace, Salvatore Ferragamo, Valentino (fashion designer), Karl Lagerfeld, Helmut Lang (fashion brand), Donna Karan, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Vivienne Westwood. Most notably, Patitz was the long-standing face of Jil Sander, representing the designer's minimalist style for a generation of fashion readers in era-defining ad campaigns photographed by Nick Knight.\nPatitz also shared another cover with the supermodels of the era for the centennial issue of American Vogue (April 1992) photographed by Patrick Demarchelier.\n\nPatitz appeared on over 200 magazine covers worldwide, including seven covers of American \"Vogue\" and thirteen covers of British \"Vogue\". French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Australian editions of \"Vogue\" have also featured Patitz on their covers and in editorials photographed by photographers such as Max Vadukul, Sante D'Orazio, Mikael Jannson, Arthur Elgort, Hans Feurer, Walter Chin, and Javier Vallhonrat. In advertising, Patitz won an exclusive cosmetic contract with Germaine Monteil makeup and perfumes.\n\nRegarded as one of the \"Original Supermodels\", she remains in demand periodically returning to the runway for select designers, such as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Chanel.\n\nPatitz has appeared in international television commercials for Cartier, L'Oréal, Revlon, Levi (jeans), Corsa, Dupont, Pantene, Dockers, and Ralph Lauren.\n\nIn 1987, she appeared in the Duran Duran music video for the song \"Skin Trade\". She then moved to California to begin a career as an actress. In 1988 she appeared in the Nick Kamen music video for \"Tell Me\". Her first appearance was a brief one as a murder victim in \"Rising Sun\" (1993). Following this, Patitz made several appearances on television series, music videos, and films. Her largest role was in the 1999 thriller \"Restraining Order\".\n\nIn 1990, Patitz was featured in George Michael's \"Freedom! '90\" music video, along with Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, and Naomi Campbell.\n\nIn 2000, she appeared in the Korn music video for the song \"Make Me Bad\".\n\nAlong with Michael J. Fox, she appears in the 2011 Carl Zeiss AG calendar, photographed by Bryan Adams in New York City in the summer of 2010.\n\nIn 1989, Patitz went to live on a ranch in Malibu, California where in 2009 she was reported to have four horses, four dogs and two cats, commenting \"I needed nature around me\".

{"id": "2290390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290390", "title": "Charlie McMahon", "text": "Charlie McMahon\n\nCharlie McMahon (born in the Blue Mountains outside Sydney, 1951) is an Australian didgeridoo player. The founder of the group Gondwanaland, McMahon was one of the first non-Aboriginal musicians to gain fame as a professional player of the instrument.\n\nHe is also the inventor of the didjeribone, a sliding didgeridoo made from two lengths of plastic tubing and played somewhat in the manner of a trombone (hence its name).\n\nIn 1955, \"Jedda\", the first Australian feature movie filmed in colour, was released, and the McMahons, living in the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney, were just one Australian family among many who went to see it. The film was notable for being the first mainstream Australian movie to have Aboriginal actors in the lead roles and characters that acknowledged the existence of, and identification with, an indigenous culture.\n\nJedda, in the screenplay, is an Aboriginal girl adopted by a white station owner's wife to replace her own child who had died (coincidentally, the station owner's surname, McMann, is a variation of the Irish surname McMahon). Deliberately isolated from all contact with her birth family and relations, Jedda, is unsure of her identity until she meets Marbuck, a tribal Aboriginal man in trouble with the European system of justice. She is seduced by his intense didgeridoo playing but their elopement into the wilderness ends in tragedy when Marbuck's tribe rejects him for having broken its own laws regarding marriage. Marbuck, spurned by both the old and the new cultures, jumps off a cliff and takes Jedda with him.\n\nThe movie was also significant for its presentation of panoramic outback scenery and its mixture of documentary and fiction (curiously, the destruction of the last reel of the film in a plane crash meant the movie's dramatic climax had to be refilmed in McMahon's home environment, the Blue Mountains).\n\nAfter the show young Charlie McMahon had been so absorbed by his cinema experience he tried to imitate the gut-stirring didge sound he heard in the movie by blowing into a garden hose and various hollow household objects like vacuum cleaner nozzles. He also developed an ongoing fascination with Aboriginals and their lives an unlikely interest for a four-year-old as \"there weren't any black fellas living near us\". He also took to running away and wandering in the scrub for comparatively long periods. Later, when he got older, he used to live off the land for a night and generally \"went native\" whenever he could.\n\nDuring 1958, when he was 7 years old, the McMahon family relocated from the Blue Mountains to the tough outer western suburb of Blacktown near Sydney, but McMahon still managed to find ways to \"go bush\" regularly.\n\nIn 1967, McMahon blew off his right arm experimenting with a homemade rocket in a friend's backyard at Seven Hills, a neighbouring suburb of Blacktown. The \"Sydney Morning Herald\" newspaper report of the incident stated that the friend, Ron Carley, had some of his fingers amputated so presumably both boys were holding the cylinder at the time it exploded.\n\nDuring a lengthy recuperation period getting used to his new metal arm (which, true to character, he wrapped in goanna hide) McMahon reactivated his earlier interest in didgeridoo playing, this time as therapy. At the same time he concentrated on previously neglected school work. During study breaks McMahon used to relax by going off to the sand flats of the Windsor River with his bongo playing brother Phil and some mates and the \"westie tribe\" would dress up in loincloths, paint their faces and have a corroboree .\n\nWith the wild side of his nature given an occasional outlet McMahon settled into study and won a university scholarship, achieving an honorary degree in Arts and Town Planning which led to him becoming, for a year, a lecturer and tutor in Town Planning at The University of Sydney. McMahon has said he became interested in studying town planning as a possible future way of correcting the all too obvious mistakes he found in the running of Blacktown. He wrote a treatise on the subject but became disillusioned when he realised the many political and vested interests trying to prevent the ideal becoming a reality.\n\nOne fateful weekend at Australia's equivalent of Woodstock, the 1973 Nimbin Aquarius Festival, McMahon found himself intrigued by the performance of The White Company an experimental Theatre Troupe featuring a number of alternative culture artists including one Peter Carolan, a 25-year-old actor with roles in Australian TV's \"Skippy the Bush Kangaroo\", \"The Rovers\", and stage productions such as \"Servant of Two Masters\", and Graham Bond's Drip Dry Dreams. Carolan came from a musical family. His mother played classical piano; his father was a professional jazz musician who performed on accordion, piano, organ, and synthesiser; and his paternal grandfather, Bart Carolan, was a composer and arranger who worked for a time at the BBC. The Carolan family had immigrated to Australia from England when Peter was 18. At the time his gift for creating flowing melodies \"with spine\" was noticed by McMahon, Carolan was playing lap dulcimer, an instrument to which he was attracted because of its simplicity – \"a primal drone, a strummed rhythm and a monophonic melody that could change mode by tuning\". No direct communication between the two musicians was made at the festival but they had both noticed each other's presence.\n\nIn 1974 a three-day arts festival season by the White Company at Sydney's Arts Castle venue included a performance by McMahon. After a productive post-show dulcimer and didgeridoo improvisation session in a dome on the roof of the venue the two players realised they had many attitudes towards music in common: McMahon was attracted to music with \"atmosphere\" while Peter had become interested in composing music that evoked a sense of \"place\" after hearing Maurice Jarre's 1962 score for the film \"Lawrence of Arabia\". The two players made a vague promise to \"do something in music together sometime in the future.\n\nIn 1974, back at his day job, McMahon was growing increasingly disillusioned with what he later described as the \"too much talk\" atmosphere of campus academic life. During one particularly stifling lecture in a dungeon-like library basement with no windows and bare walls McMahon and his assistant interrupted their discussion of map interpretation with the impulsive act of encouraging the students to join them in painting the walls. This behaviour was seen by the University Chancellor as the ultimate act of confrontation and defiance of authority by an untameable teacher and McMahon was dismissed.\n\nHe decided to do something more practical so he bought a property in a thickly forested valley on the south coast of New South Wales with two of his brothers and settled down to building a house the hard way by hand (and hook), all the time learning more about bush craft and living in a natural environment—skills that would come in handy for his next cycle of experience in the desert regions of Central Australia.\n\nIn early 1978, McMahon jumped on stage during a Midnight Oil performance at French's Tavern in Sydney and added his didge sounds to their song \"Stand in Line.\" This marked the beginning of a friendship that was to last throughout both their music careers (in 1978 Midnight Oil had only played a half dozen or so gigs under that name).\n\nAfter two and a half years of labouring and living on his diminishing savings he finished his bush retreat and was fortunate to be offered a job working for the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the position of a Development Coordinator in the Northern Territory, supervising outstation work grants to tribal people living hundreds of kilometres west of Alice Springs at the settlements of Kintore, Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia, and Papunya (the 1971 birthplace of the Australian Aboriginal dot painting revival).\n\nAn important part of McMahon's initial work program to supervise the building of a store and meeting place for the local people as the levelling of an air strip for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. He also helped construct a 400 km chain of windmills and water bores in the Great Sandy Desert area, many times driving a three-ton water truck with only a thrown right hook to stabilise the steering wheel in rough country. Because of his obvious sincerity and work for the tribal communities McMahon was sometimes invited to observe traditional ceremonies held under the resplendent starlight of nighttime Central Australia.\n\nAfter 18 months he took some time off to gig with Midnight Oil, where he learned set dynamics and the art of talking to an audience from watching frontman Peter Garrett.\n\nIn 1980, encouraged by Tony Walker, an announcer from Triple J (an Australian alternative music radio station), McMahon sold his Toyota Land Cruiser work truck and embarked on a two-month exploratory holiday to the United States starting in San Francisco, then going on to Los Angeles and Fresno. Some soundtrack work beckoned in Hollywood on a 1981 horror film called \"Wolfen\" but a musician's strike delayed the recording and, returning to San Francisco, McMahon, in the same week, missed his plane flight home and had his wallet, containing all his money, stolen creating the urgent need to find some way to earn a living wage and save for the air trip back to Australia.\n\nHe found gigs on the daunting (and taunting) San Francisco punk club circuit and survived spectacularly with an improvised solo act alternating original didgeridoo compositions with stories based on memories of his desert experiences. He also involved himself musically on stage with whoever else was performing at the same venue. One such partnership resulted when McMahon was invited to join Timothy Leary's 1980 lecture tour for a few gigs. McMahon formed a band with some musicians he met in San Francisco: Mark Isham, Kurt Wortman, and Pat Cooley. They performed under the name The Yidaki Brothers and they did their own improvised acid rock take on the subjects of some of McMahon's stories. Another notable combination was with punk electronics group Indoor Life whose songs of urban frustration \"buried in cement\" were dominated by the sound of a trombone fed through a synthesizer.\n\nAfter five months of work he found himself earning about 500 dollars a week and quickly developing a fan base but, having reached one goal, financial, it was time to aim for the next one, creative, which for McMahon meant the recording of an album which he felt could only be done in Australia, the source of his musical inspiration.\n\nMcMahon returned to Sydney and, in 1981, received his first major Australia-wide publicity when the Adelaide music paper \"Roadrunner\" published a lengthy article with the intriguing heading \"This Years Thing? One Armed Didgerdu Players? It's No Joke! Says Miranda Brown.\" \n\nAs McMahon later stated, \"I realised what I wanted to do was work with a good synth player – a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then I remembered hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when I heard he was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanaland.\" They worked on their first composition, \"Pulse,\" inspired by the sound of a heartbeat.\n\nIn the following months Carolan continued to create ideal music settings for McMahon's didgeridoo and expanded on his key image ideas such as an emu running, a drought, an eagle flying, and a landscape stretching beyond the horizon. Carolan's use of simple but powerful melodies linked to intelligently emotional arrangements openly conveyed in sound those poetic moments \"when time stops and the joys, and mysteries of life are felt.\"[19] \n\nIn 1984 McMahon and Carolan assembled a small studio band of musician friends and recorded the first Gondwanaland album under the title \"Terra Incognita\". When released on the small independent Hot label it was a critical and popular success.\n\nIn October 1984, shortly after the debut of the first album, McMahon went \"on the swag\" again, only to be caught up in a sensationalist media drama when a group of nine Aboriginals, known as the Pintupi Nine, were encountered near the last of a chain of water bores he had been overseeing between Kintore and \"the remotest outpost in Australia\"—Kiwirrkurra. A visiting journalist hyped the incident into a biblical \"finding of the lost tribe\" but the people concerned were not \"lost\" but had instead \"gone walkabout\" after rejecting attempts by 1950s Woomera rocket range personnel to resettle them at Papuna. The small tribal group managed to go through their usual birth, initiation, marriage, and death rituals for decades, living off the natural resources of their desert environment before \"coming in\" to face the anger, and relief, of their relatives. McMahon's diary at the time noted \"Tomorrow [16 Oct 1984] we will find the two men's tracks and maybe they will spend their last night free of the modern world\".\n\nIn April 1985 McMahon was flown to London to perform with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on the recording of Maurice Jarre's \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" soundtrack.\n\nWhen he returned a month later an advertisement was placed in a music paper \"Gondwana Wana Drummer.\" Only one reply was received – from an energetic multi – format percussionist called Eddy Duquemin as equally at home on electric pad drums as he was on acoustic \"skins'. He joined the live Gondwanaland band and McMahon decided to make the group his full time occupation. Because of his restless stage presence, Duquemin was soon given the nickname \"Brolga\" by McMahon—the brolga being an Australian outback bird that is renowned for its dancing; Carolan had already been dubbed \"Lizard,\" although this was later changed to \"Professor.\nIn November 1985, Midnight Oil commenced a 26-date local tour starting in Dubbo with Gondwanaland supporting. As well as feeding them to the mosh pit, this gave the newly constituted three piece some \"tour of duty\" exposure [if not exactly the type of audience they were hoping to attract].\n\nIn 1986, \"Let the Dog Out\", Gondwanaland's second album, was released. It contained a bracket of aggressive, up-tempo numbers followed by two extended compositions, the first of which, \"Ephemeral Lakes,\" later became a regular choice for meditative ambient music compilations.\n\nMidnight Oil's Black Fella/White Fella tour of remote Northern Territory Aboriginal settlements in July 1986 recruited McMahon with the task of \"co-ordinating the tour group's camping and guiding requirements and [contributing] plenty of common sense and a touch of sanity as well\" A tour book entitled \"Strict Rules\", by Andrew McMillan, and a video: \"Black Fella White Fella,\" were subsequently released and McMahon features in both.\n\nIn 1987, after a year of extensive live work in Sydney and an Arts Council sponsored four-week tour of the Northern Territory, the third album, self-titled \"Gondwanaland\" was released. It had taken many months to record and while the prolonged touring helped tighten the arrangements some of the groups intense live energy was diluted by the usual studio technique of making a separate recording of each member's instrumental part before a final mix. Despite this limitation the album won the Australian music industry's ARIA Award for best indigenous album of 1988. One track from this collection, the outstanding \"Landmark,\" features a dramatic use of McMahon's re-invention of an instrument first made in the 1970s in the UK by Dr Peter Holmes, the multi-tone, slide didgeridoo called \"didjeribone.\"\n\nIn November 1988 Gondwanaland performed during the \"Tomita Sound Cloud in Sydney – Hymn To Mankind,\" a A$3 million, Japanese government sponsored, light and sound, opera spectacular held on Sydney Harbour as part of the Australian Bicentennial celebrations. The concert attracted an audience of over 120,000 an Australian record for a live music event.\n\nIn 1991, Gondwanaland's \"Wide Skies\" was released and even long time followers of the band were surprised at the progression of Carolan's compositions. Gone were the earthy good time romps and quiet moments of reflection. Now complex panoramic chord clusters enveloped the arrangements in an almost overwhelming evocation of the sky and all that happens in and under it. This album's multi-layered textures and moods earned the band even greater critical respect.\n\nIn 1994, after the great leap forward of \"Wide Skies\", McMahon formed a second band, Gondwana, with an emphasis on rhythm and increasingly dominant bass and experimental didge sounds. The band released three albums: \"Travelling\", \"Xenophon\", and \"Bone Man\", with the last two featuring another McMahon innovation: the mouth-held use of a geologist's seismic microphone to amplify the growling subsonic didge dynamics. This approach to music gave McMahon a new audience: the trance/dance crowd. A success evidenced by the placing of a Gondwana tune in the all important opening track position on each of the two volumes of highly successful Australian trance/dance compilation series.\n\nIn 2005 McMahon experienced a bizarre case of déjà vu when he found himself, 20 years after his 1985 London \"Mad Max\" soundtrack work, in Russia with a new manager associated with a Mad Max Smash and Crash \"theme park.\" The episode was made the subject of a quirky \"Foreign Correspondent\" report in March 2006.\n\nIn 2006 Peter Carolan released a sampler CD called \"Overland\", collecting examples, old and new, of his various music explorations. Two of the new tracks, \"Airwaves\" and \"Dragonflies,\" have a strong Gondwanaland feel to them, and even though only samples of McMahon's didgeridoo are used, Carolan's Gondwanaland composing style, abandoned when McMahon left Australia and took to touring international big city venues 12 years ago, now appeared to be reactivated and continuing where it left off, this time influenced by the McMahons recent Gondwana albums.\n\nFor over 20 years McMahon's assertive didgeridoo playing style has remained an obvious (and usually unacknowledged) influence for many well known didgeridoo players, both black and white. Currently he can be seen performing, mainly solo, on the world music festival circuit in Europe, Japan, Russia, the United States, and Australia. He has two acts: one set featuring the seismic sensor he calls The Face Bass the other is a playful exploration of the musical and experimental tone possibilities of the didjeribone. In August 2008 McMahon released a DVD storage disc library of over 800 didge samples under the title \"Rhythm Organism\".\n\nOn 24 April 2012 McMahon released a subdued and mellow Gondwana album called \"Didge Heart\". On 28 July 2012 Peter Carolan died at the age of 64 from the effects of a respiratory illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished information on McMahon's early life is elusive. Many of the press clippings cited are obscure and could only be found as a single copy in a casually collected fan archive. Most of these fan cuttings did not record full or part origin details but these will be added when they are known. If a date is missing the year the article was written is worked out from other references in the text.\n\n"}

It replaced the Archbishopric of Magdeburg after its secularization by Brandenburg. The duchy's capitals were Magdeburg and Halle, while Burg was another important town. Dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807, its territory was made part of the Province of Saxony in 1815.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishopric of Magdeburg began to be administered by secular princes, mostly Lutheran, in 1545 during the Protestant Reformation. In the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, the archbishopric was promised to the House of Hohenzollern of the Margraviate of Brandenburg upon the death of its incumbent administrator, August, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. The city of Magdeburg was also required to pay homage to the prince-electors of Brandenburg. In 1666, Elector Frederick William used his developing army to install a permanent Brandenburger garrison in the city.\n\nBrandenburg-Prussia inherited the Archbishopric of Magdeburg upon the death of August of Saxe-Weissenfels in 1680 and reorganized the secularized territory as the Duchy of Magdeburg, with the electors of Brandenburg as hereditary dukes. The Halle region (Saalkreis), an exclave of the province, was surrounded by the Principality of Anhalt, the County of Mansfeld (acquired by Prussia in 1790), and the Electorate of Saxony. Against the wishes of the duchy's Lutheran nobility, a Calvinist chancellor was appointed to govern the duchy. Through the leadership of August Hermann Francke, Halle became the center of Pietism in Brandenburg-Prussia.\n\nWhen Elector Frederick III crowned himself Frederick I, King in Prussia, in 1701, the Duchy of Magdeburg became part of the new Kingdom of Prussia. King Frederick William I's 'allodification of the fiefs', or efforts to modernize feudal land ownership laws, was opposed by the duchy's Junker nobility, which feared losing their tax-exempt status. The nobles received judgements from the imperial court in Vienna protecting their rights in 1718 and 1725. Justus Henning Böhmer became chancellor of the province in 1743.\n\nWith the creation of the General Directory in 1723 by Frederick William I, the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Principality of Halberstadt, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg were administered by the second department of the General Directory. A state-capitalized agricultural credit union (\"Landschaft\") was created in the duchy in 1780 for the exclusive use of the nobility. Control over the Magdeburg lands gave the monarchy a lucrative monopoly over the Stassfurt and Halle salt deposits.\n\nThe estates of Pomerania voluntarily raised 5,000 troops for the Prussian Army during the Seven Years' War; their initiative was duplicated by the nobility of Magdeburg and neighboring provinces.\n\nIn the War of the Fourth Coalition, Prussia was defeated by Napoleon in 1806. In the Treaty of Tilsit the following year, the Duchy of Magdeburg was dissolved. The ducal territory west of the Elbe River, including the cities Magdeburg and Halle, were made part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, a client state of the First French Empire. The ducal territory east of the Elbe remained in a drastically reduced Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nPrussia reacquired the Magdeburg and Halle territories during the War of the Sixth Coalition. In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, the territories of the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Altmark, and part of the Kingdom of Saxony were coalesced to create the new Prussian Province of Saxony.\n\n\n"}

He invented a gull-wing aircraft design, also known as \"Puławski wing\" and constructed a series of Polish PZL fighters.\n\nHe was born in Lublin. In the summer of 1920, during the Soviet offensive in the Polish-Soviet War, he volunteered for a Boy Scout battalion. In late 1920 he commenced studies at Warsaw University of Technology. He was a member of the Aviation Section of the Students' Mechanical Club, where he constructed some gliders. He distinguished himself as a thorough and able student. In 1925 he graduated from the University, receiving the Engineer title, and left for practice in the Breguet works in France. After his return, he served in the national service, completing military aviation school in Bydgoszcz and becoming a pilot. From 1927 he became a main designer of the Central Aviation Workshops (CWL) at Słupecka Street in Warsaw, soon reorganized into the PZL (\"Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze\" - State Aviation Works).\n\nTo meet a requirement of the Polish military department, in 1928 Puławski designed a modern all-metal high-wing fighter with an inline engine, PZL P.1. For the P.1, he invented a gull-wing design, giving the pilot an excellent view from his cockpit. The P.1 was flown in 1929 and met with great interest in the world. Its wing design became also known as \"Puławski wing\" or \"Polish wing\", and was later copied in some other designs in the world. The P.1 was not produced, in a favour of Puławski's next designs with a radial engine, preferred by the Polish Air Force. A development of the P/1 was the PZL P.6 with a radial engine, first flown in 1930. With a pilot Bolesław Orliński, it won a National Air Races in the USA. It was named the best fighter in the world by some of military press at that time. Its improved variant, PZL P.7, was produced for the Polish Air Force (150 made). In early 1931 Puławski designed another fighter development PZL P.8, returning to his favourite inline engine. In 1930, he was also ordered to start working upon the P.7 development, with a stronger engine and begun design work upon the PZL P.11 then.\n\nPuławski also flew aircraft in the Warsaw Aeroclub. He died on March 21, 1931 in a crash of his newest amphibious flying boat PZL.12 in Warsaw, at the age of 29 (the plane fell due to strong wind, after take-off). After his death, the PZL P.11 project was finished by Wsiewołod Jakimiuk, becoming the main Polish fighter during the Invasion of Poland 1939. Additionally, a faster export model PZL P.24, based entirely on Puławski's construction features, was developed and sold to some countries.\n\nPuławski was one of the most talented Polish designers. Partly due to his death, Puławski's fighters, most modern in the early 1930s, had not been replaced with modern successors before 1939, when they were already obsolete.\n\n"}

Along with Pilot Corporation and Berkshire Hathaway, it is a joint-owner of Pilot Flying J (the largest truck stop chain in the United States), and Maverik convenience stores.\n\nThe company was founded in 1968 by O. Jay Call and headquartered in Ogden, Utah. A lifelong fan of aviation, Call named it Flying J in honor of the aviation industry. Mr. Call, his wife, Irene, and Richard \"Buzz\" Germer died while piloting a Cessna Citation en route to Sun Valley in March 2003.\n\nIt sought Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy protection in December 2008, blaming its financial woes on the collapse in oil prices and tighter credit markets. Pre-bankruptcy, Flying J was the largest retailer of diesel fuel in North America with approximately 220 locations in the United States and Canada and 15,000 employees. The company produces and refines petroleum products for its truck stops. The company also offers vehicle maintenance, banking, insurance and telecommunications services for the trucking industry, and a number of restaurants at its locations.\n\nThe company had record sales for a privately held company in the industry of $18.0 billion in 2008, but later climbing prices for crude oil and a crumbling demand for gasoline eroded margins and affected cash flow. Flying J is cited by the Terror-Free Oil Initiative as a company that does not purchase oil from terrorism-sponsoring nations. The company's plans for travel plazas have occasionally met opposition from local residents concerned about traffic safety and other issues. In 2006 Flying J associated with Shell Canada to improve highway services in Canada.\n\nIn July 2009, Pilot Travel Centers agreed to acquire Flying J's travel stops. As part of the deal, Pilot will keep the Flying J name on existing locations as opposed to converting them to the Pilot brand, while the in-house Flying J restaurants will be replaced by national chains like Denny's. The merged entity will be called Pilot Flying J.\nIn June 2010, Flying J put forth a Chapter 11 plan to repay all creditors in full from the proceeds of the sale of its 250 travel plazas to Pilot, for a combination of cash and stock valued at $1.6 billion. Under Flying J's plan, its lenders and creditors will be paid in cash, and its owners, whose numbers include members of the company's founding Call family, will retain all the equity in a scaled-down Flying J. As of July 2010, hearings on the plan continue under Judge Mary F. Walrath of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.

There are two main types of security parameter: \"computational\" and \"statistical\", often denoted by formula_1 and formula_2, respectively. Roughly speaking, the computational security parameter is a measure for the input size of the computational problem on which the cryptographic scheme is based, which determines its computational complexity, whereas the statistical security parameter is a measure of the probability with which an adversary can break the scheme (whatever that means for the protocol).\n\nSecurity parameters are usually expressed in unary representation - i.e. formula_1 is expressed as a string of formula_1 formula_5s, formula_6, conventionally written as formula_7 - so that the time complexity of the cryptographic algorithm is polynomial in the size of the input.\n\nThe security of cryptographic primitives relies on the hardness of some hard problem. One sets the computational security parameter formula_1 such that formula_9 computation is considered intractable.\n\n\nSecurity in cryptography often relies on the fact that statistical distance between\nis small. We formalise this using the statistical security parameter by saying that the distributions are \"statistically close\" if the statistical distance between distributions can be expressed as a negligible function in the security parameter. One sets the computational security parameter formula_13 such that formula_14 is considered a \"small enough\" chance of the adversary winning.\n\nConsider the following two broad categories of attack of adversaries on a given cryptographic scheme: attacks in which the adversary tries to learn secret information, and attacks in which the adversary tries to convince an honest party to accept a false statement as true (or vice versa). In the first case, for example a public-key encryption scheme, an adversary may be able to obtain a large amount of information from which he can attempt to learn secret information, e.g. by examining the distribution of ciphertexts for a fixed plaintext encrypted under different randomness. In the second case, it may be that the adversary must guess a challenge or a secret and can do so with some fixed probability; in this we can talk about distributions by considering the algorithm for sampling the challenge in the protocol. In both cases, we can talk about the chance of the adversary \"winning\" in a loose sense, and can parameterise the statistical security by requiring the distributions to be statistically close in the first case or defining a challenge space dependent on the statistical security parameter in the second case.\n\n\n"}

She made numerous television appearances in guest starring roles on such programs as \"The Fugitive\", \"Kojak\", and \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\". She was also a regular cast member on TV's \"Bracken's World\", \"The Paul Lynde Show\", \"C.P.O. Sharkey\", \"Another World\" and its spin-off, \"Texas\". Her television, film and stage career spanned three decades.\n\nShe was featured with William Shatner in \"The Hungry Glass\", the 16th episode in the first season of \"Boris Karloff's Thriller\" in 1961. In 1962, she played a leading role in the first season of \"Combat!\", in the episode \"No Hallelujahs for Glory\" as a persistent war correspondent.\n\nAllen is perhaps best known on TV for her role as the creepy saleslady in the first-season episode of Rod Serling's original version of \"The Twilight Zone\", entitled \"The After Hours\", where actress Anne Francis (playing 'Miss Marsha White') finally realizes that she is a mannequin and that her month of freedom and living among the humans is over. Allen's saleslady character (seen by no one but Marsha) is the mannequin whose turn in the outside world is up next and has already been delayed by one full day, thus explaining her slightly peeved attitude.\n\nIn 1963, Allen starred with John Wayne, Dorothy Lamour and Lee Marvin in the John Ford film \"Donovan's Reef\". She also starred in \"Diamond Head\" with Charlton Heston and Yvette Mimieux. Both movies were filmed on location in Hawaii. Allen also appeared with James Stewart in \"Cheyenne Autumn\" and won a Laurel Award in 1963 as the year's most promising film actress.\n\nAllen honed her stage skills by joining and performing with the Helen Hayes Repertory Group before expanding into the big and small screens. Allen was twice nominated for Tony Awards for her performances on Broadway in \"The Gay Life\", as Actress, Supporting or Featured (Musical) (1962) and \"Do I Hear a Waltz?\", as Best Actress in a Musical (1965). She can be heard singing throughout the original cast album of \"Waltz\", available on CD.\n\nHer other notable stage productions on the Great White Way and beyond included \"Romanoff and Juliet\", \"Lend an Ear\", \"Sherry!\", \"California Suite\", \"The Pajama Game\", \"The Tender Trap\", \"Show Boat\", \"South Pacific\", and culminating in the 1980s Broadway musical \"42nd Street\", as fading star Dorothy Brock. In 1983 she appeared as Dr. Gwen Harding on the CBS soap opera \"Guiding Light\".\n\nAllen quietly retired from show business in 1996, after touring numerous cities throughout the world for over a decade with her \"42nd Street\" role from Broadway. This was her last, significant acting job after appearing in the 1980s TV series \"Texas\" for two seasons.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Allen ventured into retail business as she operated a dress store in a San Fernando Valley shopping mall. Entertainment columnist Dick Kleiner reported: \"She found a vacant store, rented it, decorated it. She does all her own buying and delivering ... and a lot of the selling.\" She told Kleiner that she thought it wise \"for an actress to have something going for her when there is nothing doing on the acting front.\"\n\nShe was married briefly to Baron Karl von Vietinghoff-Scheel, but they divorced and she never remarried.\n\nAllen died from kidney disease, aged 77, in Fishkill, New York. She was predeceased by her only sibling, brother Joseph L. Gillease, and survived by her sister-in-law, Marion Gillease, her nephew and godson, Patrick J. Gillease, her niece, Erin Gillease Phelan, and two grand-nieces, Alicia Phelan and Alexandria Phelan.\n\n\n\n"}

Because of the mountain's importance and location, it came to metonymously signify \"north\" in Hebrew; the name is therefore sometimes mistakenly given in translation as . He was equated with the Greek god Zeus in his form and later with the Roman .\n\nBecause Baʿal Zaphon was considered a protector of maritime trade, sanctuaries were constructed in his honor around the Mediterranean by his Canaanite and Phoenician devotees. \"Baal-zephon\" thereby also became a placename, most notably a location mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures' Book of Exodus as the location where the Israelites miraculously crossed the Red Sea during their exodus from Egypt.\n\nThe name Baʿal Zaphon never appears in the mythological texts discovered at Ugarit. Instead, it occurs in guides to ritual and in letters, where it is used to differentiate this form of Baʿal from others such as Baʿal Ugarit. The earliest discovered depiction of the god—where he stands astride two mountains in a smiting posture—dates to the 18th century . Other depictions show him crowned and bearing a scepter. As a protector of maritime trade, his temples also received votive stone anchors. The treaty between Asarhaddon and King Baʿal of Tyre ranks Baʿal Zaphon third behind Baʿal Shamem and Baʿal Malage. In addition to his temple at Jebel Aqra and Ugarit, Baʿal Zaphon is known to have been worshipped at Tyre and Carthage and served as the chief god of the colony at Tahpanes.\n\nA 14th-century letter from the king of Ugarit to the Egyptian pharaoh places Baʿal Zaphon as equivalent to Amun. Temples to Zeus Kasios are attested in Egypt, Athens, Epidauros, Delos, Corfu, Sicily, and Spain, with the last mention occurring on Rome's German border in the 3rd century.\n\n1st-millennium  Assyrian texts mention Baʿal Zaphon as the name of the mountain itself. (Locally as well, the mountain was worshipped in its own right.)\n\nThe books of Exodus and Numbers in the Hebrew Scriptures records that the Israelites were instructed by YHWH to camp across from a place named \"Baʿal Zaphon\" in order to appear trapped and thereby entice the Pharaoh to pursue them:\nGmirkin identified this as Arsinoe on the Gulf of Suez. A Ptolemaic-era geographical text at the Cairo Museum lists four border fortresses, the third being \"Midgol and Baʿal Zaphon\". In context, it appears to have been located on a route to the Red Sea coast, perhaps on the canal from Pithom to a location near Arsinoe.\n\nAccording to Herodotus (who considered it to mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria), at Ras Kouroun, a small mountain near the marshy Lake Bardawil, the \"Serbonian Bog\" of Herodotus, where Zeus' ancient opponent Typhon was \"said to be hidden\". Here, Greeks knew, Baal Sephon was worshipped\n\n\n\n"}

It was filmed in locations in the U.S. and Canada including the small town of Delia, Alberta.\n\nMatty Demaret (Barry Pepper) is the son of a mob boss, but he is used as little more than an errand boy. His relative and friend Chris (Andy Davoli) shares this urge to be part of something bigger, and Matty finally convinces his father to give him a job, with the help of his father's right-hand man Teddy (John Malkovich). Matty and Chris get their friend Johnny Marbles (Seth Green) to fly up to retrieve a bag full of money for Matty's father Benny \"Chains\" Demaret (Dennis Hopper), as there have been mysterious shortages in their money lately.\n\nOn the way back with the cash, Marbles stops in a small Montana town to refuel his personal plane. He has been instructed to guard the bag with his life so he takes the bag with him as he goes to pay for the fuel. However, Marbles sees the sheriff and his deputy and is paranoid that they may question him about the bag's contents. Marbles is also in possession of cocaine which he dumps on the runway. He drops the bag amongst a pile of luggage waiting to be loaded onto another flight, and despite telling the cashier to keep the change, the other flight takes off before he can retrieve his bag. Unknown to him, the bag of money was taken by two local teenage pothead skateboarders who work as baggage handlers at the airport. (He learns the money's location later.)\n\nHe calls Matty and tells him the news. Matty, though upset, knows that he must fix the situation quickly and quietly if he ever wants to work for his father. Matty, Chris, and their friend Taylor (Vin Diesel) fly to the small town of Wibaux, Montana to help Marbles search for the missing money.\n\nWhile in town, Matty and the other guys attract the attention of two local law-enforcement officers (Tom Noonan and Shawn Doyle) who find out about the money and want to keep it for themselves. The mob guys then try to negotiate with the officers to get the money back but are turned away. Matty calls Teddy and Teddy arrives in Wibaux with two other mob henchmen. Chris decides to leave for home and disappears. Marbles hangs around in a bar with the two mob henchmen who secretly hate him, while Taylor and Matty wait in their hotel for word from the Sheriff. After taking him outside in a friendly manner, the two mob men throw Marbles to the ground and ask where Chris is. Marbles, defending his friend, tells them he doesn't know and one of the men shoots him dead and puts his body in a trunk.\n\nLater that night, a deal is arranged for the Sheriff and Deputy to meet Matty and Taylor in an abandoned abattoir. When they arrive, the lawmen are planning to kill Matty and the others and keep the money, but Teddy and the two mob men show up when Matty and Taylor do and the entire thing turns into a Mexican standoff. Chris arrives and shoots the Sheriff's cousin who came to help the Sheriff, and Matty and Taylor inquire about Marbles. Chris says that he thought he was with them. Teddy gives a signal to the two henchmen and they all fire on Chris who is killed. The Sheriff and Deputy, in the chaos, shoot the two mob men. Taylor then kills both of the lawmen. As Teddy prepares to shoot Matty, Taylor is shot instead in the arm when about to defend his friend from the bullet. Teddy's gun is out and Matty holds him at gunpoint. Matty says that it is Teddy that has been stealing and causing shortages from his father all along. Teddy tries to reload and shoot Matty claiming that Matty doesn't have the guts to shoot him. Teddy turns around and attempts to shoot Matty but Matty quickly shoots Teddy in the chest several times, killing him. Matty and Taylor get the money and return home. Matty hands the bag of money to his father and quits the family business. Matty and Taylor then drive off as the credits begin to roll.\n\n\nThe film premiered on September 8, 2001 at Oldenburg International Film Festival in Northwest Germany, three days before the September 11th attacks. The shots of the World Trade Center towers were kept in the film and never edited out.

In the 2001 National Census it had a population of 2,138.\n\nRenton is particularly famous for the village's association football side. Renton was one of the 11 founder members of the Scottish Football League and winners of the 1885 and 1888 Scottish Cup, producing many famous players.\n\nThe Renton takes its name from Cecilia Renton (daughter-in-law of Tobias Smollett) after whom the modern sandstone, 'model' village was named in 1762. Dalquhurn Bleachworks in 1715 and Cordale Printworks in 1770 were responsible for attracting new industrial workers. At the north of the village stood the Place of Bonhill, a residence from 1642, to the South was Dalquhurn House. Two parallel north-south streets, Main Street and Back Street were first joined by Station Street, Stirling Street, Burns Street, Thimble Street, Market Street and Red Row. In late Victorian times, the village extended southwards to Leven Street, Alexander Street and John Street. Further expansion occurred in the 1930s as housing was built in the grounds of Cordale House. In the early 1960s the majority of the sandstone properties in the village were compulsory purchased by Dumbarton County Council, demolished and replaced by Dumbarton County Council with 1960s Brutalist-style concrete houses and flats; the majority of which have been replaced by proper houses, own front & back door, by the Cordale Housing Association.\n\nIt has traditionally been a stronghold of radical left-wing politics; during the 1930s it had Communist councillors, Bunger Lamont, never toed the Labour Party line and independent councillors such as Jimmy McKenzie (1960/70s), and since 1999 it has been represented on West Dunbartonshire council by Jim Bollan, at present the Scottish Socialist Party's only councillor.\n\nIt lies on the main road, A82 as was, between Alexandria and Dumbarton. Renton railway station is on the line from Glasgow to Balloch. It has a footbridge across the River Leven to the Strathleven Industrial Estate (once a major source of employment), and a minor road, with a steep 33% hill, across Carman Hill to Cardross.\n\nDespite a report that appeared in The Observer on Sunday 22 February 2009(1) stating that the buried ruins of the manor house of Robert the Bruce had been found in the Pillanflatt area of Renton, this interpretation has yet to be confirmed. While there is strong Charter evidence to indicate the presence of a manor or hunting lodge belonging to Bruce in the area, this is more likely to have been located in the vicinity of Mains of Cardross, to the south of the Pillanflat, rather than in the area to the north of it. Stone, plaster and mortar are not generally susceptible to scientific dating techniques, and lime mortar was used from the Roman period up to the late 19th or early 20th centuries.\n\nAccording to Bruce Historian Stuart Smith, a charter dating from 1362 charter states that Robert the Bruce resided between Kings Park of Cardross and the lands of Pillanflatt, bounding the lands of Dalquhurn. This would suggest a site to the south of the Pillanflat, but to the north of Castle Park, in the vicinity of what is now Mains of Cardross.\n\nIn recent times, Renton has seen some major social regeneration most notably, although not restricted to, housing. \n\nBefore Renton existed in its current form Robert the Bruce lived and died at the Manor of Cardross, the exact location of which is uncertain, but may have been near or in what is now Renton, although it was probably in Cardross Parish. The writer Tobias Smollett was born in Dalquhurn House in what is now Renton in 1721 and is commemorated by Smollett Monument in the village', erected by his cousin three years after the author's death in Italy in 1771.\n\nMP and Lord Provost Duncan McLaren was born in Renton, as was MP in, and speaker of, the Canadian House of Commons, James Allison Glen and author Jane Duncan. Professional footballers Alex Jackson, Andy Duncan, John O'Hare, Jack Ashurst, and James Kelly all originated in Renton, as did boxer Skeets Gallacher, after whom Gallacher Way is named.\n\nWhen Renton F.C. won the World Cup, the footballing world was in its infancy in 1888, almost exclusively played by Scottish and English clubs. It was a World Cup Championship by default – nevertheless Renton's claim is undisputed. They won the Scottish Cup with a 6-1 thrashing of Cambuslang F.C. Then they humbled English Cup holders West Bromwich Albion, who had prepared in Scotland for two weeks. The score was 4-1 in front of a record 10,000 fans at Hampden Park. Renton endorsed their title with an away win against \"The Invincibles\" of Preston North End. A \"Champion of the World\" sign was proudly displayed on the pavilion at Tontine Park. They were ahead of their time in training for stamina and strength. Their weapon was Renton's own famous \"chicken bree\", the ingredients never disclosed but it was probably port wine switched with a couple of eggs administered daily.\n\nQuoiting (pronounced \"kiteing\") was a popular sport amongst the male villagers. Quoiting greens were found in Renton, Alexandria, Hardgate and many Ayrshire villages. Quoits were heavy iron rings, rounded on one side, flat on the other and weighed 8-12 pounds but could be up to 23 pounds. They were hurled at a steel pin driven into a three-foot square clay bed, with the common length of the green being 18 yards. Renton were Scottish Champions in 1949 and 1986. There is a photograph of the victorious 1949 team in Renton Railway Station.\n\nThere are several recreational and consumer related facilities in Renton. Such as a new mini supermarket and healthy living centre, and of course Tom Swans Sweet Shop along with a bakery, And once a pub that closed in June 2019, bowling green, freemasons lodge. Wylie Park (known locally as Tontine Park ) is also used most Saturdays and Sundays for football games. It is home to local youth football team Renton Craigandro. A newly opened Youth Club at the Autism and Aspergers Centre (old nursery). Offering a youth club every Wednesday, 6pm-7:30pm for Primary 1 to 6 and 7:30pm-9pm for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Years at High School.\n\n"}

{"id": "2290495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290495", "title": "Combat reenactment", "text": "Combat reenactment\n\nCombat reenactment is a side of historical reenactment which aims to depict historical forms of combat. This may refer to either single combat, melees involving small groups, or nearly full-scale battles with hundreds of participants.\n\nDepending on the intended effect, performances may have the aim of presenting historical martial arts reconstruction, or just offer entertainment, and different groups have different standards of authenticity.\n\nDemonstration of historical fencing begins with Alfred Hutton in the 1890s.\n\nThe Association for Renaissance Martial Arts distinguishes the following modes of historical martial arts demonstrations:\n\nIn the 2000s, several competition events for choreographed historical martial arts demonstrations were originated, combining the judgement of aspects of historical fencing techniques, stage combat qualities like acting and entertainment value, as well as historical accuracy of costumes and equipment.\n\nToday, tent pegging is the only form of jousting officially recognized by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports. Ring jousting became the official state sport of Maryland in 1962 and was the first official sport of any American state.\nThe Italian town of Arezzo continues to hold an annual jousting tournament, which dates to the Crusades.. Modern theatrical medieval-style jousting competitions are popular at American Renaissance fairs and similar festivals, and feature riders on horseback attempting various feats of skill with the lance, which may not always have a basis in history.\n\nReenactment of battles is a major and popular component of historical reenactment.\n\nDue to the number of participants involved, most reenacted battles cannot be choreographed in any detail, and safety guidelines or \"combat rules\" are imposed on participants instead, prohibiting most realistic actions. Some reenactment battles take the form of a competition, where the two \"armies\" try to defeat each other within the actions permitted by the combat rules.\n\nBattles in film are not inhibited by such restrictions, due to the possibilities of cutting and closeup. They are fully choreographed, and are not performed in a single go but divided into individual sequences.\n\nThe Society for Creative Anachronism fighting is based on Medieval fighting on foot, in the spirit of tournament fighting with wooden swords. The armor is handmade and based on historical artifacts. Unlike most reenactment events, the events are not pre-determined. It's a participatory sport; the fighters win or lose a bout, much like Karate or Judo.\n\n\nSince the 1990s, an increasing number of companies offers replicas of historical arms and armour. Blade weapons used for combat reenactment are unsharpened, and specialized sparring weapons (e.g. Albion's \"Maestro Line\") also have rounded points. Blunt, flail and staff weapons are more problematic since the replica essentially has the same effectiveness as the \"serious\" version, unless rattan or latex weapons are employed, which in turn lack the characteristics of the originals and induce handling techniques inconsistent with the weapons they are supposed to represent.\n\n"}
{"id": "2290497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290497", "title": "Authenticity (reenactment)", "text": "Authenticity (reenactment)\n\nIn historical reenactment, authenticity (sometimes referred to as the A-factor or simply A) is a measure of how close an item, prop, action, weapon, tactic, or custom is to what would actually have been used or done in the time period being depicted. For example, in most northern European medieval reenactment cotton is an \"inauthentic\" material—as opposed to wool or linen—though it would be \"authentic\" in more modern periods and events, such as American Civil War reenactment or World War II reenactment. Likewise, pop culture references and talking about modern events or objects (e.g., wrist watches, mobile phones, or contemporary politicians) is inauthentic.\n\nGenerally, the ratio of events and groups enforcing strict authenticity to those permitting (limited) in authenticity among the participating reenactors is estimated to be half-and-half, i.e., there are approximately as many groups enforcing historical accuracy as there are permitting a more liberal use of the term \"authentic\". This does, however, vary from country to country.\n\nIn the US, reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into three categories, based on the level of concern for authenticity.\n\nSome, called \"farbs\" or \"polyester soldiers\" are reenactors who spend relatively little of their time or money maintaining authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or even period behavior. A \"good enough\" attitude is pervasive among farbs, although even casual observers may be able to point out flaws. \nThe origin of the word \"farb\" (and the derivative adjective \"farby\") is unknown, though it appears to date to early centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961. Some think that the origin of the word is a truncated version of \"far be it from authentic.\" An alternative definition is \"far be it for me to question/criticise\", or \"fast and researchless buying\". Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German \"farbe\", color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined, or the German \"farbische\", manufactured, indicating obviously modern items. According to Mr. Burton K. Kummerow, a member of \"The Black Hats, CSA\" reenactment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors ever since.\nMany of the early Italian replica rifles were marked with what looked like \"F.A.R.B\" among the proofmarks. Removal of this would be to defarb, and the term came to cover other objects.\n\nAnother group of reenactors often is called \"Mainstream\". These reenactors are somewhere between farb and authentic. They are more common than either farbs or authentics.\n\nMost mainstream reenactors make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the time-period, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items, such as air mattresses and sleeping bags, are sometimes used \"after hours\" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see.\n\nAt the other extreme from farbs are \"hard-core authentics\" or \"progressives,\" as they prefer to be called, sometimes derisively called \"stitch counters\". Hard-cores generally seek an \"immersive\" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of their chosen time period might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event.\nHard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate \"reenactorisms\".\n\nTo make their equipment authentic, a reenactor must first decide on the time period, geographic location, and social status they wish to portray. The collection of clothing and equipment is typically called a \"kit\" and the fictional alter ego is called a \"persona\".\nSometimes when a person has interests that a single persona can't reasonably encompass, for the sake of being authentic, they might create more than one persona. For example, someone might be interested in Norse (\"Viking\") cultures but also be interested in economics and social history that led to the Landsknecht, and might create two separate personae and kits. They can then choose the persona they will portray according to which hobby they want to do, the location of the reenactment, or the weather (cultures that wore a lot of wool and fur are more popular to reenact in winter than summer).\n\nSince authenticity of certain equipment vary between periods and regions, it can be difficult to ensure an entire set or \"kit\" of clothing and gear is authentic for a particular historical persona. Most organized societies have recognized norms for kit and garb for their historic and regional specialty. A key philosophy is to research items in advance, vs. buying things and then trying to \"fit them in\" to the time and place being reenacted. For example, the Vikings are not known to have used plate armour, but some would try to justify it because the earlier Roman Army did. A person might try to pass off an interesting Polish hat by claiming their French persona had traveled to Poland. Such tactics serve to confuse an uneducated audience, however, since many will simply assume that if everyone is portraying Vikings, French pikemen, Prussians grenadiers, etc. that they are also wearing and using items common to that era and people. Authenticity can apply to other things. For example, a card game, song, or military tactic is authentic if known to be used during the period.\n\nThe quest for authentic clothes and equipment often requires archaeological evidence, archival research, and other historical sources that reveal what was used at the time. A reenactor may become an amateur historian (or even a professional historian) in pursuit of evidence and sources to create an accurate persona. Many time periods of reenactment have online discussion boards where reenactors and historians discuss the merits of various items, how to make them, or where to purchase them.\n\nSeveral factors commonly limit the attainable level of authenticity. These include:\n\n\nThe German approach of authenticity (reenactment) is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain era. Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities. Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but as mere staffage for the immersion experience.\n\nThe strictness with which authenticity is enforced varies widely with different events and groups. While some consider only documented historical use to be authentic, and ban all inauthentic gear and behaviour from reenactment activities, others permit materials that plausibly could have existed, others permit inauthentic materials that can't be seen by the public, and still others only require that \"it has to look authentic from 10 meters away\" (i.e. from a distant audience's perspective).\n\nSimilarly, many groups permit equipment combined from a wider range of centuries than what could be considered historically accurate (e.g. 12th century soldiers wearing barbute helmets). This sometimes results from safety rules that require protective gauntlets and helmets, even when this interferes with historical accuracy.\n\nIn addition to mixing multiple centuries of a general period in a single event (usually to ensure a larger number of participants), some events feature more than a single period, especially if the event strongly focuses on combat displays or battles. In such cases, it is not unusual that the same reenactor participates in more than one show, sometimes with only slightly altered gear (depending on how strictly authenticity is enforced).\nA typical example is a \"clankie\" (a reenactor in full plate armour) removing his armour, picking up a round shield and participating in a Dark Age battle.\n\nMany groups, especially in medieval reenactment, heavily promote the use of \"market speech\", i.e., talking in a way that \"sounds\" appropriate for the period. Inauthentic equipment and behaviour is often referred to via descriptive phrases like \"pocket dragon\" (for a lighter or box of matches) and \"horseless carriage\" (for a car or other engine-powered vehicle) to circumvent strict enforcement of authentic speech. Other groups expect reenactors to stay fully in-character throughout an event, and refrain from commenting on non-period items. To adequately explain activities to an audience, many such groups designate one or two people as \"interpreters\" who can step out of character to discuss things from a modern perspective.\n\nOther ways to circumvent the need for authentic equipment include \"hiding\" plastic bottles (usually by wrapping them in cloths or furs), using \"bindings\" (long straps of cloth or fur) to make inauthentic footgear look more adequate, or simply hiding coolboxes inside wooden chests.\n\nFor safety and comfort, authenticity is usually restricted to designated public areas, thus allowing for the use of portable toilets and inauthentic tenting by reenactors outside these areas.\n\nA typical issue among strictly authentic reenactors is the inclusion of female combatants, as this is a clash between authenticity (there were no female combatants in most reenacted periods) and modern concepts of sexual equality.\n\nSimilarly, some groups enforce authentic hairstyles (e.g., 20th century soldiers are usually not expected to wear long hair or beards) and often (inauthentic) jewelry is not permitted — although in combat reenactment this is often more of a safety issue than a question of authenticity.\n\n"}

{"id": "2290517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290517", "title": "WPBN-TV", "text": "WPBN-TV\n\nWPBN-TV, virtual channel 7 (UHF digital channel 35), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Traverse City, Michigan, United States, serving the northern Lower and eastern Upper peninsulas of Michigan. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which also operates Traverse City-licensed ABC affiliate WGTU (channel 29) and Sault Ste. Marie-licensed full-time satellite WGTQ (channel 8) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with owner Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WGTU/WGTQ as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on M-72 just west of Traverse City and transmitter facilities east of Kalkaska, Michigan. WPBN also operates a low-powered digital fill-in translator on UHF channel 50 from a transmitter south of Harrietta in the Manistee National Forest.\n\nLike other network affiliates in this vast and mainly rural area, it operates a full-time, full power satellite in Cheboygan, WTOM-TV (virtual channel 4, UHF digital channel 16), whose transmitter is located on US 23 east of the city. Aside from its transmitter, WTOM does not maintain any physical presence in Cheboygan. WTOM's signal reaches as far as Petoskey, Cedarville, Indian River, and Brevort. It was originally intended to serve Sault Ste. Marie and the Eastern Upper Peninsula as well, but the current digital signal does not cover this area. To make up for this shortfall in coverage, WPBN/WTOM is simulcast in high definition on the second digital subchannel of WGTU/WGTQ.\n\nTogether, the two stations are known on-air as TV 7&4 and serve the largest television market by land area east of the Mississippi River: 23 counties in the Northern Lower Peninsula, three counties in the Eastern Upper Peninsula, and portions of Northern Ontario including Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. However, WTOM has not been available in Canada on cable since the early 2000s when Shaw Communications replaced it with Detroit's WDIV-TV (channel 4). WTOM also serves as the default NBC affiliate for Alpena as that area does not have an affiliate of its own.\n\nWPBN-TV began broadcasting on February 13, 1954 airing an analog signal on VHF channel 7. It was owned by the Biederman family and their company, Midwest Broadcasting, along with WTCM-AM 1400 (now 580). Company president Les Biederman had signed on WTCM, Northern Michigan's oldest radio station, in 1940. Over the next decade, he bought or signed-on several other AM stations throughout the area. These were known as the \"Paul Bunyan Network,\" with WTCM as the flagship station. Since channel 7 covered much of the territory covered by the radio stations, Biederman decided not to call his new station WTCM-TV (for Traverse City, Michigan) but rather WPBN-TV (for Paul Bunyan Network). \n\nIn the 1950s, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collapsed the eastern half of the Upper Peninsula into the Traverse City–Cadillac market. At the time, the only television station in that area had been private CBC affiliate CJIC-TV. Since WPBN was already operating at the maximum power allowed, Biederman signed-on WTOM-TV in Cheboygan on May 16, 1959. WTOM was the first American television station that could be received in the Eastern Upper Peninsula, although Cheboygan is actually in the northernmost part of the Lower Peninsula. Since then, the two stations have been known collectively as 7&4. \n\nUntil 1971, it shared ABC programming with CBS affiliates WWTV/WWUP. WPBN aired ABC's sports programming on the weekends while WWTV aired some of the network's game shows and soap operas. In 1971, WGTU signed-on and took the ABC affiliation. In 1980, Midwest Broadcasting wanted to expand its broadcast operations in Northern Michigan. However, the FCC told the family that they could do so only if they sold some stations to stay under ownership limits. One of the stations sold off was WPBN/WTOM (which count as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes), which went to U.S. Tobacco.\n\nU.S. Tobacco owned the station until 1986, at which time sold to Beam Communications. Beam owned the station until 1990, and then sold to Federal Broadcasting Company.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2005, it was owned by Raycom Media. In late 2005, following that company's purchase of the Liberty Corporation, Raycom announced that WPBN would be sold along with another NBC affiliate in the Upper Peninsula, WLUC-TV in Marquette. The sale was necessary to help meet FCC restrictions on station ownership. On March 27, 2006, Raycom announced that Barrington Broadcasting would acquire twelve Raycom stations, including WPBN. The FCC approved the deal in June 2006 and the finalization took place on August 12. At that point, the station joined WLUC, Saginaw's NBC affiliate WEYI-TV and (to a degree) Toledo, Ohio's NBC affiliate WNWO-TV as part of Barrington's family of stations in and around Michigan. \n\nOn September 19, 2007, an application was filed to the FCC by Max Media to sell WGTU, its full-time satellite WGTQ, and CW cable station to Tucker Broadcasting for $10 million. After approval, that company entered into a shared services agreement with Barrington. According to the FCC filing, WPBN would sell advertising time and provides other programming for Tucker's stations. The combined operation was based at WPBN's studios, which were renovated over the summer to accommodate the change. WPBN and WGTU began to share a website as well. For the digital transition on June 12, 2009, WPBN filed a petition with the FCC move its Traverse City digital signal on UHF channel 50 to the analog tower in Harrietta to maintain coverage in that area. It then signed-on a new digital signal on UHF channel 47 from WGTU's tower in Kalkaska. \n\nUnlike WPBN, WTOM-DT on UHF channel 35 did not initially offer NBC programming in full high definition. Instead, the signal was transmitted in an unconverted format. A true high definition signal for that station was included once WTOM shut down its analog signal on the transition date. Its new digital signal covers a fraction of the area once served by the VHF analog signal due to the rather low-powered 78 kW digital signal on UHF. To make up for this shortfall in coverage, standard definition feeds of WPBN and WTOM were added to the digital subcarriers of WGTU and WGTQ respectively; these were later upgraded to high definition.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Barrington Broadcasting announced the sale of its entire group, including WPBN/WTOM, to Sinclair Broadcast Group. Sinclair also acquired the LMA for WGTU/WGTQ, which was sold to Cunningham Broadcasting. The sale was completed on November 25. Nearly all of Cunningham's stock is held by trusts for the Smith family, founders and owners of Sinclair. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Sinclair owns both stations. Cunningham, previously known as Glencairn, has long been used as a shell corporation to allow Sinclair to operate duopolies where Sinclair cannot legally own them. The Traverse City–Cadillac/Sault Ste. Marie market has only seven full-power stations, too few to legally permit a duopoly. Also, even if the market had enough full-power stations to allow a duopoly, a WPBN/WGTU duopoly still wouldn't be legal as both stations are among the top four stations in the market.\n\nThe stations' digital signals are multiplexed:\n\nWPBN-TV presently broadcasts 37 hours, 10 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 5 minutes each weekday, one hour on Saturdays and 1 hour, 5 minutes on Sundays).\n\nWhen WTOM first began broadcasting, it had its own studio on US 23 east of Cheboygan, and broke off from WPBN's signal to air its own newscasts. However, by the early 1980s, this operation had been eliminated, and WTOM is now a full-time satellite of WPBN.\n\nWPBN's owners have traditionally poured significant resources into its news operation, resulting in a much higher-quality product than conventional wisdom would suggest for such a small market. Currently, the station produces and airs 27 hours of news a week, a considerable amount for a station in the 120th market. In terms of viewership, WPBN has long been a distant runner-up in the news ratings behind market leader WWTV, according to Nielsen Media Research. WPBN has traditionally had more of a Traverse City focus, while WWTV focuses on the entire Northern Michigan region. \n\nStation alumni include Christa Quinn and the immortal \"Deputy\" Don Melvoin who first hosted the \"Deputy Don\" kids' show in the 1950s. After a stint in Hollywood that included roles on \"The Twilight Zone\" and a movie filmed on Mackinac Island called \"Somewhere in Time\", Melvoin came back to WPBN to host \"Deputy Don Rides Again\" and the horror flick \"Count Zappula\". Don Melvoin died in 2002. In addition to its main studios, there is a bureau in Gaylord on West Main Street, and in Manistee at the Vogue Theater on River Street. In the past, the station had also maintained newsrooms in Petoskey, Cadillac, and at the former WTOM studio in Cheboygan.\n\nOn September 10, 2007, it began airing a midday broadcast weekdays at 11 after \"Today\" expanded to four hours. In January 2009, the station laid off nine employees and canceled the weekday midday show. After WGTU consolidated its operations with WPBN, it became possible full newscasts would return to WGTU for the first time since 1984. On September 13, 2010, WPBN began producing a weeknight newscast at 6:30 on WGTU, \"UpNorthLive Tonight\". It originates from a secondary set at WPBN's studios, and features local news and weather but also goes into detail covering community events and various businesses. There is no sports report given in this broadcast. The only other newscast on the station is a pre-recorded 10-minute weeknight update at 11. \n\n\n"}

The band's music blends 1980s dub and reggae with 1990s punk and indie rock. The band's members include Ben Brewer on lead guitar and vocals, and Gunnar Olsen on drums. Jeff DaRosa was formerly the band's lead vocals and bass player.\n\nBen Brewer, a.k.a. Benjamin Bronfman, son of billionaire Edgar Bronfman Jr., met Olsen in high school. The two have played in several bands together. One of these bands turned into an early incarnation of The Exit. In 2000 Brewer met Jeff DaRosa while attending Emerson College in Boston. DaRosa grew up in Watertown, Massachusetts and was the bassist of the local punk band The Vigilantes. Brewer convinced DaRosa to join the group, and they started practicing in basements around Boston. The band made a demo tape which made its way into the hands of Daniel Rey known for his work with The Ramones. Rey produces the band's first record, \"New Beat\", which came out on Some Records, a label started by Walter Schreifels. \n\nThe band started touring in early 2001, booking their own shows. \"New Beat\" received favorable reviews, many of which likened the band to The Clash, The Police and U2. The artwork was done by Damian Genuardi of the Explosion.\n\nThe Exit then entered the studio with producer Ron Saint Germain (Bad Brains, Tool, Sonic Youth) to produce a follow up, \"Home For An Island\". The album featured Brewer singing lead for the first time, tribal rhythms, dubbed out guitars, and psychedelic bridges. The album was a political response to life in post-9/11 New York City. Songs include \"Soldier,\" \"Home For an Island,\" \"Let's Go to Haiti\" and \"Back to the Rebels.\" The album was originally released in 2004 on Some Records, but in 2005 The Exit signed to Wind-Up Records and re-released \"Home for an Island\", adding three new songs \"Sun Will Rise in Queens,\" \"Pressure Cooker\" and \"Warm Summer Days.\" Reviews were good. The Exit supported Muse on two different US tours.\n\nOn August 15, 2006, through a post on their MySpace blog, the band announced the departure of Jeff DaRosa. Olsen and Brewer noted the band will continue with a yet-to-be-announced lineup. The band was officially disbanded in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Vatakara is located between Thalassery and Koyilandy. The municipality of Vadakara covers an area of 23.33 km and is bordered by Mahé to the north and Payyoli to the south. It is the headquarters of Vatakara taluk, which consists of 22 panchayats. During the reign of the Kolathiris and Zamorins, Vatakara was known as Kadathanadu. During the British Raj, it was part of the North Malabar region of Malabar District in the state of Madras. The historic Lokanarkavu temple, made famous by the Vadakkan Pattukal (ballads of North Malabar), is situated in Vatakara.\n\nVatakara is located at and has an average elevation of It is situated about 49 km to the north of Kozhikode City, approximately 44 km to the south of Kannur City, and adjacent to Mahé. The town lies by the side of a river variously called the Moorad river, the Kuttiady river, or Kottakkal river. The town's position relative to this river led to it being called Vadakkekara (north bank), later contracted to Vatakara. Towards the east, near the panchayats of Nadapuram and Kuttiady, Vadakara borders the Wayanad district along the Western Ghats section. In the west, like many of the towns in Kerala, Vatakara is flanked by the Arabian Sea. The Kuttiyadi river meets the sea to the south of Vatakara, forming small islands and sandbars near the river mouth. \n\nVatakara was the capital of the historical region called Kurumba Nadu, home of the Kurumbar people. In the pre-British era, a major part of the current Vatakara taluk, including the area currently constituting the Vatakara municipality, was ruled by a chieftain as a feudatory to the Kolathiri kingdom. The remaining part of the taluk was initially part of the Polathiri kingdom and later ruled by the Zamorins of Calicut. The boundary between these kingdoms is believed to have been in the region in Vatakara known as Puduppanam, with the Moorad river forming a geographical boundary. The Kadathanad dynasty was established when a Polathiri royal was forced to cross over to Kolathunadu after an unsuccessful battle with the Zamorins, settled in the region, and married a Kolathiri princess. A town leader before the government took over, Bala Kurup, still has documented descendants in Vatakara.\n\nVatakara became an important trade center in the region by the early 18th century, exporting agricultural products such as coffee, pepper and coconut. Together with smaller nearby ports at Chombal, Muttungal and Kottakkal, Vatakara became one of the major centers of trade at a level with those at Cannanore, Tellicherri and Calicut. Building on a thriving economy led by a strong sea trade, the Kadathanad rulers established a strong naval force which became known as the \"Lord of the Seas\", since it was the strongest naval force from the Malayalam-speaking region.\n\nA significant factor in the rise of Vatakara as a trade center was the rise and subsequent fall of the Kunjali Marakkars of Kottakkal. During the 16th century CE, Kunjali Marakkars were the admirals of the Zamorin's naval fleet and were famous for their valor and sea battle tactics. The Marakkars established their stronghold in Kottakkal and built a fort there. The last Marakkar, Kunjali IV, was defeated at the beginning of the 17th century by the combined forces of the Zamorin, with whom he had fallen out, and the Portuguese, who resented the interference of Kunjali and his followers in their trade route. The fort was completely destroyed by a bombardment from the sea. However, the Marakkars' knowledge of ship handling and tactics continued to be passed down in the community of seafarers in this area of Vatakara, later allowing the ruler of Kadathanad to establish his supremacy in the sea and to enforce a 'pass' system for trade ships.\n\nThe region became a separate kingdom around 1750, when the then chieftain took the title of Kadathanad Rajah. During this period, there are records of frequent skirmishes between Kadathanad and the ruler of Kottayam as well as the foreign colonial powers of the British, based in Thalassery, and the French, based in Mahé.\n\nIn legend, Vatakara is the birthplace of Unniyarcha, Aromal Chekavar, and Thacholi Othenan, the heroes of the Vadakkanpattu (ballads of North Malabar). The Thacholi family home, Thacholi Tharavadu, is still preserved and the anniversary of Thacholi Othenan's birth is celebrated in the Thacholi Manikkothu Kavu temple.\n\nNotable temples in the area include Lokanarkavu and Kottakkal Bhagavathi Temple, the second richest temple in North Malabar. Kalari Ullathil Temple is also situated near Vatakara town. \n\nThe martial art Kalaripayattu originated in Vatakara. \n\nMost of Vatakara's inhabitants are labourers and farmers, while some are government employees. A large number of expatriates from Vatakara work in Middle Eastern countries, and their remittances have a strong influence on the local economy. Some emigrants work in nearby states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.\n\nAs of the 2011 Census of India, Vatakara had a population of 75,740, with males constituting 48% of the population and females 52%. Vatakara has an average literacy rate of 83%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 80%. 11% of the population was under 6 years old.\n\nFishing is one of Vatakara's main commercial activities. The Moorad River flows into the Arabian Sea at a point close to the town. \n\nVatakara is organized around two commercial hubs, the old and new bus depots. The area around the old bus depot contains commercial establishments as old as 100 years. Recently, commerce has shifted to the area around the new bus depot and the road towards Kannur, with many new buildings, including hospitals and flats being built or planned. \n\nNut Street is the distribution center for nuts, including coconuts and areca nuts. Produce flows to collection outlets and is dried, packed, and transported to other states. Northern Kerala is well known for the production of coconuts.\n\nHospitals include the CO-OP Hospital, Asha Hospital, Janatha Hospital, Ceeyam Hospital and the Parco specialty hospital.\n\nThe Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society is a unique labour cooperative initiative centered in Madappally that was inspired by the Indian sage Vagbhatananda. The society was registered in 1925.\n\n\n\nAdditional temples in the region include Kizhakkedathu temple, Sivapuram Sree Mahadeva Kshethram, Arathil Bhagavathi Kottakkal temple, Thuneri Sree Vettakkorumakan Kshethram, Ponmeri Shiva temple, Kalleri Kuttichathan temple, Kaliyampalli temple and Nagath Sri Muchilottu Bhagavathi temple.\n\nThacholi Meppayil Kunjhu Othenan or Mepayil Tacholi Manikoth Kovilakathu Kunji Othena Kurup (Udayana Kurup of Thacholi Manikoth House) or more popularly Thacholi Othenan was a legendary hero who is believed to have lived during 16th century in North Malabar region of Kerala, India. He is praised in the Vadakkan Pattukal (ballads of North Malabar).[6][7] Thacholi Ambadi, another renowned martial arts expert, was Othenan's son\n\nThe location of the Marakkar fort on the southern bank of the Moorad river, 46 km south of Kozhikode, is now known as Kottakkal. A building in Kottakkal that belonged to Kunjali Marakkar serves as a small museum, with collections of ancient swords, cannonballs and knives.\n\nThe Sandbanks recreation area is located on a small peninsula with the Moorad river on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west, approximately 3 km towards the south of Vatakara town. The Sandbanks Bungalow, which was built by Mr Wilfred Vincent Reilly in 1946, stands on this peninsula. The area is owned by the Aditya Birla Management Corporation Ltd and managed by Vadakara Municipality. A coastal Police Station is being built on the peninsula.\n\nSargaalaya village was established in 2011 as an arts and crafts village by the Department of Tourism of the government of Kerala. The village is located on the banks of the Moorad River and provides cottages for local artisans. It is managed by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society Ltd. \n\n\nThere are many schools, colleges and tuition centers in Vatakara.\nRani Public School's Official Website\n\nRani Public School, Chorode (ranischool.com) and Gokulam Public School are the 2 main private schools in Vadakara. \n\nGovernment College, Madappally is a post-graduate campus affiliated with the University of Calicut.\n\nThe 62nd Regional Centre of the Indira Gandhi National Open University was established at Vatakara in January 2011, serving students from the Malabar region, including the Kasargod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, and Malappuram districts.\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1157 as the Margraviate of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear, Margrave of the Northern March. In 1356, by the terms of the Golden Bull of Charles IV, the Margrave of Brandenburg was given the permanent right to participate in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor with the title of Elector ().\n\nThe early rulers came from several different dynasties, but from 1415 Brandenburg and its successor states were ruled by the House of Hohenzollern for over 500 years. From 1618 onward, Brandenburg was ruled in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. The Hohenzollerns raised Prussia to a kingdom as the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, and from then on Brandenburg was \"de facto\" treated as part of the kingdom even though it was legally still part of the Holy Roman Empire. The titles of Margrave of Brandenburg and Elector of Brandenburg were abolished along with the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and Brandenburg was formally integrated into Prussia. Despite this, the Prussian kings still included the title \"Margrave of Brandenburg\" in their royal style. From 1871 to 1918 the Hohenzollerns were also German Emperors.\n\nThis includes Kings of Prussia with the title of Margrave of Brandenburg (1806–1918) and pretenders to the throne of Prussia (1918–present)\nIn 1815 Brandenburg was constituted as the Prussian Province of Brandenburg without a sovereign ruler, but with Upper Presidents appointed by the central Prussian government. The upper president carried out central prerogatives on the provincial level and supervised the implementation of central policy on the lower levels of administration. \n\n\nSince 1875, with the strengthening of self-rule within the provinces, the urban and rural counties elected representatives for the provincial diets (Provinziallandtage). These parliaments legislated within the competences transferred to the provinces. The provincial diet of Brandenburg elected a provincial executive body (government), the provincial committee (Provinzialausschuss), and a head of province, the land director (Landesdirektor). Self-rule was abolished under the Nazi dictatorship.\n\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War, Brandenburg, which had previously been merely a province of Prussia, re-emerged as a German \"Land\".\n\n\nAfter being abolished in a reorganization of the territories administered by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the \"Land\" Brandenburg was restored in the prelude to German unification in 1990.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2290542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290542", "title": "Christian amendment", "text": "Christian amendment\n\nChristian amendment describes any of several attempts to amend the United States Constitution by inserting explicitly Christian ideas and language. The most significant such attempt began during the American Civil War and was spearheaded by the National Reform Association.\n\nIn February 1863, during the American Civil War, a coalition of eleven Protestant denominations from seven northern states gathered to discuss the state of the nation. Seeing the Civil War as God's punishment for the omission of God from the Constitution, they discussed a proposed amendment to alter the wording of the Preamble to acknowledge God. The idea that civil governments derive their legitimacy from God, and Jesus in particular, was alleged to be based on Biblical passages such as Psalm 2 and . The original draft of the amendment, by Pennsylvania attorney John Alexander, read:\nThe Christian Amendment Movement was founded the next year and quickly renamed the \"National Reform Association\" with Alexander as its first president. They sent a memorial to Congress formally proposing the following amendment:\nA delegation from the National Reform Association sought to meet with Abraham Lincoln on February 11, 1864, to solicit his endorsement of the amendment. Lincoln's pastor, Rev. Phineas Gurley, arranged for Lincoln to meet the delegation. After hearing their petition, Lincoln responded:\nThe proposal was supported by Senators Charles Sumner, B. Gratz Brown and John Sherman, but did not come to a vote in Congress. One member of the National Reform Association, James Pollock, played a role in getting the phrase \"In God We Trust\" on the two-cent coin in 1864.\n\nAnother version of the amendment read:\nSimilar proposals were considered by Congress in 1874, 1895, 1896, 1910, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967, and 1969 but none passed.\n\nWith the growing backlash in American society against communism in the 1940s and 1950s, new efforts were made to introduce Christianity into the Constitution, although these efforts were now in the form of standard constitutional amendments. In 1954 Vermont Senator Ralph Flanders proposed:\n\nNone of the proposals came to a Congressional vote.\n\nThere were calls for similar amendments in the wake of the 1962 Supreme Court case \"Engel v. Vitale\", which ruled school-sponsored and dictated prayer in schools unconstitutional. Over 200 similar amendment proposals were introduced to Congress between 1894 and 1984.\n\n\n"}

She traveled the Middle East and Europe with her family before the age of ten, when she moved with her mother and brother to the United States. Along with her four sisters, she formed a band and developed a talent for harmonies. Her first exposure to music was Middle Eastern music combined with the late 1970s American influences of Alice Cooper, Elton John, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and The Beatles.\n\nAfter moving to the US, she lived in Poughkeepsie, NY until moving to Great Falls, Virginia for high school. She later attended the Corcoran School of Art in Georgetown and then transferred to The Catholic University of America to study drama and music, while pursuing a career in hairstyling. She dropped out of college to work as a runway model with designers such as Jacques Fath, Nina Ricci, Oscar de la Renta, Alberta Ferretti, Badgley Mischka, Chloe and Bill Blass. She traveled to Paris and Germany and modeled for London designer Zandra Rhodes in the UK. Afterward, she returned to the US to live in Miami, Florida. In Miami, she met musician/songwriter Shane Soloski in the late 1990s and decided to move to Los Angeles to form a band with him.\n\nTheir first gig was an open mic at Molly Malone's where she met and played with Todd Sucherman (drummer for Styx).

Its seat is Magdeburg; it is suffragan to the Archdiocese of Paderborn.\n\nThe Diocese was erected out of Paderborn territories in 1994. Its history dates back to the medieval Archbishopric of Magdeburg established in 968 AD.\n\nAt the 967 synod of Ravenna, Emperor Otto I obtained the consent of Pope John XIII to elevate Magdeburg to the see of an archbishop. The next year, against the valiant resistance by the Archbishop of Mainz and the Halberstadt bishop, Otto created the new archbishopric dedicated to Saint Maurice. It then headed an ecclesiastical province comprising the dioceses of Brandenburg, Havelberg, Zeitz, Merseburg, and Meissen, all located in the Saxon Eastern March. The first metropolitan was Archbishop Adalbert of Magdeburg (c. 910 - 981), a missionary to the Polabian Slavs, who also held the title of \"Primas Germaniae\".\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards, the Magdeburg metropolitans ruled as prince-archbishops over extended territories along the Elbe river. From 1207 onwards, Archbishop Albert had Magdeburg Cathedral rebuilt in a Gothic style that reflected his power position among the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. At the beginning of the modern era, Magdeburg had to cope with the claims of the neighbouring Saxon and Brandenburg electorates. In 1476 Ernst II of Saxony, son of the Wettin elector Ernest, was elected archbishop; he occupied the city of Halle, where he had the Moritzburg residence erected between 1484 and 1503.\n\nDuring the Protestant Reformation, large parts of the population within the prince-archbishopric turned Lutheran and from 1566 Magdeburg was ruled by a diocesan administrator. The estates were devastated in the Thirty Years' War. According to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the archiepiscopal territories were to be secularised and adjudicated to the Hohenzollern electors of Brandenburg. These provisions were implemented upon the death of the last administrator Duke Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels in 1680, whereafter the secular Duchy of Magdeburg passed under the rule of the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg.\n\nFrom 1670 the former Catholic archdiocese was under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany. After the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the territories, now part of the Prussian Province of Saxony, were administrated by the Archbishops of Paderborn. The Magdeburg provosts at St. Sebastian's Church were also appointed episcopal commissioners. The Catholic church structure persisted even after the division of Germany from 1949 when Magdeburg, then part of East Germany, remained the see of auxiliary bishops sent from Paderborn in West Germany. In 1973 Bishop Johannes Braun was appointed Apostolic Administrator, who, though officially still subordinated to Paderborn, ruled over Magdeburg as a \"de facto\" diocese.\n\nAfter German reunification, Braun's successor Leo Nowak was elevated to a bishop according to an Apostolic constitution issued on 27 June 1994 by Pope John Paul II. Magdeburg thereby was separated from Paderborn and restored as an autonomous suffragan diocese of the ecclesiastical province, dedicated to Saint Norbert of Xanten, with Saints Maurice and Gertrude of Helfta as secondary patrons.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2009 it became the Christmas number one, due to a campaign to prevent \"The X Factor\" winner's song from gaining the Christmas number one in the United Kingdom for a fifth successive year.\n\n\"Killing in the Name\" has been described as \"a howling, expletive-driven tirade against the ills of American society.\" The uncensored version contains the word \"fuck\" 17 times. The song builds in intensity, as Zack de la Rocha chants the line \"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me\", murmuring the line the first four times, building in a crescendo the next four times and screaming angrily the line the final eight times culminating with De La Rocha's screaming \"Motherfucker!\" The song alludes to the history of US police forces being a white supremacist organization such as the Ku Klux Klan, whose symbol is the burning cross. The BBC News website refers to it as railing against \"the military–industrial complex, justifying killing for the benefit of, as the song puts it, the chosen whites.\" The song reflects the racial tensions that exist in the United States; it was released six months after the Los Angeles Riots, which were triggered by the acquittal of four white police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King.\n\nTom Morello created the heavier guitar riffs while teaching a student drop D tuning; he briefly paused the lesson to record the riff.\nThe next day the band met in a studio and according to Morello, \"Killing in the Name\" was created in a collaborative effort, combining his riff with \"Timmy C.'s magmalike bass, Brad Wilk's funky, brutal drumming and Zack's conviction\". Like all Rage Against the Machine songs tuned to Drop D, it was recorded on a Fender Telecaster.\n\n\"Killing in the Name\" was originally written and recorded shortly after Rage Against the Machine formed as part of a 12-song self-released cassette. The band's first video for \"Killing in the Name\" did not receive heavy airplay in the United States due to the explicit lyrics. The song received substantial airplay in Europe and drove the band's popularity outside its home country.\n\nAfter signing with Epic Records, the band released their self-titled debut album in November 12, 1992. It reached triple platinum status, driven by heavy radio play of \"Killing in the Name\". The album also included the singles \"Freedom\" and \"Take the Power Back\".\n\nOn February 21, 1993, when BBC Radio 1 DJ Bruno Brookes accidentally played the full uncensored version of the song on his Top 40 Countdown, leading to 138 complaints. Brookes was recording an advertisement for next week's Top 40 Countdown while the song played. The incident has subsequently been referred to by numerous British rock media.\n\nThe song drew controversy again in Britain in November 2008, when it was played over the speakers in an Asda supermarket in Preston, Lancashire, prompting numerous complaints from customers.\n\nIn 2012, Tom Morello criticized the UK Independence Party (UKIP) for using \"Killing in the Name\" in rallies; Morello wrote on Twitter: \nHey UKIP and Nigel Farage: Stop using 'KILLING IN THE NAME' for your racist/rightwing rallies. We are against everything you stand for. STOP. IT.\nIn early December 2009, English DJ Jon Morter and his wife Tracy launched a group on the social networking site Facebook encouraging people to buy the song in the week before Christmas to prevent the winner of the \"X Factor\" television show from achieving the Christmas number one slot in the United Kingdom for the fifth year running. On December 15, the BBC reported the group had more than 750,000 members.\n\nAs the \"X Factor\" song was donating some of the profits to charity the \"Rage against X Factor\" campaign encouraged supporters also to give to charity. Alongside the group, a Justgiving page was created to raise money for homeless charity Shelter which, as of 20 December, was reported to have raised over £70,000 (approximately $110,000).\n\nAfter the creator of \"The X Factor\", Simon Cowell, publicly denounced the campaign as \"stupid\" and \"cynical,\" the group gained more attention and was mentioned on various UK news channels, radio stations and websites. Rage Against the Machine added their support to the campaign. Guitarist Tom Morello said that achieving the Christmas number one would be \"a wonderful dose of anarchy\" and that he planned to donate the unexpected windfall to charity. Dave Grohl, Muse, Them Crooked Vultures, Liam Howlett and The Prodigy were among many musicians and celebrities supporting the campaign. The campaign received support from Paul McCartney, who had appeared on \"the X Factor\" with the finalists, and \"X Factor\" contestants Jedward also added their support. Critics noted that both \"The X Factor\" and Rage Against the Machine are signed to labels that are part of Sony BMG; Morello dismissed conspiracy claims as ridiculous. Kasabian's Tom Meighan and Sergio Pizzorno expressed their happiness at the campaign's success in an NME interview, where they also heavily criticised \"The X Factor\".\n\nRage Against the Machine attracted controversy when they performed an uncensored rendition of the song on BBC Radio 5Live in mid-December 2009, despite the hosts asking them to censor the expletive end. During the crescendo of their performance, frontman Zack De La Rocha started out only singing \"I won't do what you tell me\", with a pause where he normally sings \"fuck you\", but after a few lines, he screamed the lyrics, \"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me\" repeatedly. Hosts Nicky Campbell and Shelagh Fogarty apologized afterward.\n\nOn December 20, 2009, BBC Radio 1 revealed the song had successfully reached the number one spot, selling more than 500,000 copies and being the first exclusively download-only single to be Christmas number one in the process. The following week Joe McElderry's cover of the song \"The Climb\" became the last British number one single of 2009. \"Killing In The Name\" dropped to number two, falling 38 places to number 40 the week after, and dropping out of the top 75 the following week, falling to number 100.\n\nThe campaign to get the song to Christmas number one also spread to Ireland, where, like the UK, the Christmas number one had been dominated by \"X Factor\" finalists for the previous five years. The campaign was less successful in Ireland and McElderry beat Rage Against the Machine to Christmas number one, with Rage Against The Machine taking the number-two spot.\n\nOn June 6, 2010, Rage Against The Machine performed at a free 'thank you' gig for 40,000 fans in Finsbury Park. On stage Tracy and Jon Morter were handed a representative cheque in the amount of £162,713.03, representing the proceeds from donations to JustGiving and royalties from sales of the single.\n\nAs a result of the campaign, the song is featured in the 2011 UK edition of the Guinness World Records under the category of 'Fastest-selling digital track (UK)', after recording 502,672 downloads in its first week.\n\nThe video, produced and directed by Peter Gideon, a guitar student of Tom Morello who had a video camera, was filmed during two shows in small Los Angeles venues, the Whisky a Go Go and the Club With No Name. Released in December 1992, the uncensored version of the video clip was shown on European MTV but was banned on American MTV because of the explicit lyrics. As a result, the video's existence was in doubt until its release on \"Rage Against the Machine: The Video\".\n\nThe cover of the CD-single is Malcolm Browne's Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of Thích Quảng Đức's self-immolation in Saigon in 1963 in protest of the murder of Buddhists by the US-backed Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's regime. This photograph is also used as the cover of the eponymous \"Rage Against the Machine\" album.\n\nThe cover of the Australian version of the CD-single has the words \"killing in the name\", in large, red block capitals, and a much smaller and tightly-cropped version of the photograph in the bottom right-hand corner.\n\nIn July 2009, \"Killing in the Name\" was voted at number two in the Hottest 100 of all time countdown poll, conducted by Australian radio station, Triple J. More than half a million votes were cast in. The song was also voted at number 17 in the 1998 edition of Hottest 100 of All Time and was voted number 6 on the Hottest 100 list in 1993.\n\nIn 2007, \"Killing in the Name\" earned a spot on \"Guitar World\"s list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" at number 89.\n\nIn 2002, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine listed \"Killing in the Name\" as the 24th in its 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.\n\nIn 2010, the \"New Statesman\" listed it as number 12 on their list of the \"Top 20 Political Songs\" as voted for by the Political Studies Association.\n\nIn 2010, 2011 and 2012, The Rock radio station in New Zealand have held the Rock 1000 countdown which counts down the top 1000 rock songs of all time, as voted by the public; in 2010 and 2011, the song was in the top five, while in 2012, the song featured at number seven. In 2011 and 2012, \"Killing in the Name\" was played uncensored, with a preceding message from the Prime minister, John Key, approving the playing of the uncensored version of the song due to the large number of complaints received by MediaWorks New Zealand regarding the 2010 countdown not giving any warning that the song was uncensored. In 2017, Killing In The Name made it to number 1 in the Rock 1500 and was presented by long serving broadcaster, Roger Farrelly.\n\nThe song was performed as an extended instrumental at their first public performance at Cal State in the Quad, on October 23, 1991. Bassist Tim Commerford is known to chant the backing vocals of \"now you do what they told ya\" of the chorus during most live performances.\n\nZack de la Rocha sometimes changes the lyrics in the second verse from \"Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses\" to \"Some of those that burn crosses are the same that hold office\" when playing live.\n\nAs part of supergroup Audioslave, guitarist Tom Morello incorporated instrumentals from Rage Against the Machine and cover versions of \"Killing in the Name\" into their performances.\n\nRage Against the Machine performed the song live in 1999 at the Woodstock '99 festival, burning the American flag during the song. In this performance, de la Rocha changed the lyrics to \"Some of those that work forces are the same that burn churches\".\n\n\"Darkness of Greed\" and \"Clear the Lane\" were re-mastered versions of the respective demo tracks. Another version of \"Darkness of Greed\", titled merely \"Darkness\", was included on the for \"The Crow\". The previously unreleased demo appeared on the XX 20th Anniversary Edition of their debut album, which was released on November 27, 2012.\n\n\nDuring one of his last performances before he died, American comedian Bill Hicks ended a set by smashing his microphone against a stool while singing along to \"Killing in the Name\" playing over the loudspeakers.\n\nAs part of the US War on Terror, the song was used by military interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Music was played at painfully high volume levels for hours on end, as a form of psychological torture. \"The fact that music I helped create was used in crimes against humanity sickens me,\" noted Morello.\n\nDuring the 2019–20 Chilean protests, the song was covered with some of the lyrics modified alluding to the Chilean police force's misuse of violence in repressing peaceful protestors.\n\nIn the \"Daria\" episode \"The Big House\", the opening guitar riffs from \"Killing in the Name\" can be heard in the background in the scene where Daria Morgendorffer is reading a book while her sister Quinn is pacing back and forth.\n\nThe song featured in the British television series Skins. Metal music fan Rich Hardbeck tells ballerina Grace Blood to stick up for herself, he encourages her using the song as an example, and has her chant the chorus.\n\nThe song also plays in the \"South Park\" episode \"Guitar Queer-O\".\n\n\"Killing in the Name\" is featured on fictional alternative rock station in the video game \"\".\n\nA cover version of \"Killing in the Name\" is a playable song in the \"Guitar Hero II\" video game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. The song reappears in \"\", also for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 as well as the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 3, where it is a master recording. The song's lyrics are altered in both games to remove the expletives.\n\nThe song is offered as downloadable content for the guitar games \"Rock Band 3\", released in March 2012, and \"Rocksmith 2014\", released in December 2014.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2290611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290611", "title": "Häme Castle", "text": "Häme Castle\n\nTavastia Castle (, ) is a medieval castle in Hämeenlinna, Finland. Originally located on an island, the castle now sits on the coast of lake Vanajavesi. The castle consists of a central keep and surrounding curtain walls, enclosed by a moat. The keep originally had five turrets, but only two are apparent today. The curtain wall has a gatehouse, battlements, an octagonal brick corner turret, and a round gun turret. The lower tiers of the keep and curtain wall are of masoned granite and the upper tiers are red brickwork.\n\nAlthough the exact date is disputed, the castle is generally considered to have been constructed in the 13th century. In addition to its status as a military fortress and home for Swedish nobility, the castle has seen use as a prison, and is currently a museum operated by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. The castle is one of the main tourist attractions of southern Finland, being the centerpiece of the city and a popular venue for events, including renaissance fairs.\n\nThe castle's age is disputed. Traditionally, the construction of the castle has been connected to Birger Jarl's Second Swedish Crusade, which would date the castle in the mid-13th century. However, there are no archeological finds from the castle that can be firmly dated to a period earlier than the 1320s. An earlier fortification from the early 1300s only some away in Hakoinen also contests Tavastia Castle's age, as only one castle (\"Tauestahus\") is listed in Tavastia in a royal document from 1308. Also, the Russian Novgorod First Chronicle only mentions one castle during their plundering of Tavastia in 1311, its description also matching with the castle in Hakoinen.\n\nIn the mid-1500s, under Gustav I, the castle lost much of its military importance. Some restoration was conducted in the early 1600s, and in 1639, the castle's nearby settlements gained official city status as Hämeenlinna. The castle continued to be neglected by Swedish rule throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, as its military interests shifted to the southern Baltic sea. Tavastia Castle was briefly ceded to the Russian army during the Great Northern War, after which the castle's defensive systems were upgraded with bastions. After the Finnish War, when Finland became the Grand Duchy of Finland under Russian rule, the castle was turned into a prison. It served as such until 1953, when massive restoration work started. The castle has been a public museum since 1979, the facilities of which can also be rented for private events.\n\n"}
{"id": "2290621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290621", "title": "Continental Illinois", "text": "Continental Illinois\n\nThe Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company was at one time the seventh-largest commercial bank in the United States as measured by deposits, with approximately $40 billion in assets. In 1984, Continental Illinois became the largest ever bank failure in U.S. history, when a run on the bank led to its seizure by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Continental Illinois retained this dubious distinction until the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 during the financial crisis of 2008, which ended up being over seven times larger than the failure of Continental Illinois.\n\nContinental Illinois can be traced back to two Chicago banks, the Commercial National Bank, founded during the American Civil War, and the Continental National Bank, founded in 1883.\n\nIn 1910 the two banks merged to form the Continental & Commercial National Bank of Chicago with $175 million in deposits – a large bank at the time. In 1932 the name was changed to the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.\n\nIn May 1984, Continental Illinois became insolvent due, in part, to bad loans purchased from the failed Penn Square Bank N.A. of Oklahoma—loans for oil and gas producers and service companies and investors in the Oklahoma and Texas oil and gas boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Due diligence was not properly conducted by John Lytle, an executive in the Mid-Continent Division of oil lending, and other leading officers of the bank. Lytle later pleaded guilty to a count of defrauding Continental of $2.25 million and receiving $585,000 in kickbacks for approving risky loan applications. Lytle was sentenced to three and a half years in a federal prison. The Penn Square failure eventually caused a substantial run on the bank's deposits once it became clear Continental Illinois was headed for failure. Large depositors withdrew over $10 billion of deposits in early May 1984. In addition, the bank was destabilized by massive losses from an options firm it had just acquired, First Options Chicago (FOC), a leading clearinghouse operation. FOC guaranteed that trades will settle, but found during the market's crash in October 1987 that many customers could not meet their margin calls, forcing FOC to step in to settle with cash or the underlying securities to complete the trade. This meant Continental absorbed massive risks on behalf of FOC customers, in the period leading up to a major stock market crash. Nassim Nicholas Taleb summarized the practice \"...(FOC) were so incompetent... they netted exposure by traders, not realizing that the (sic) trader that goes bust, the trader making money isn't going to write (FOC) a check\". Ultimately, this meant that Continental Illinois had to infuse $625M in emergency cash to keep its $135M FOC investment afloat. The FOC crisis, and the extent to which it may have jeopardized Continental Illinois; the banking system; and the financial markets as a whole, was the subject of a hearing by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), in 1988.\n\nDue to Continental Illinois' size, regulators were not willing to let it fail. The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) feared a failure could cause widespread financial trouble and instability. To avert this, regulators prevented the loss of virtually all deposit accounts and even bondholders. The FDIC infused $4.5 billion to rescue the bank. According to Daniel Yergin in \"\" (1991), \"The Federal Government intervened, with a huge bail-out—$5.5 billion of new capital, $8 billion in emergency loans, and, of course, new management.\" A willing merger partner had been sought for two months but could not be found. Eventually, the board of directors and top management were removed. Bank shareholders were substantially wiped out, although holding-company bondholders were protected. Until the seizure of Washington Mutual in 2008, the bailout of Continental Illinois under Ronald Reagan was the largest bank failure in American history.\n\nThe term \"too big to fail\" was popularized by Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the FDIC's intervention with Continental Illinois. The term had previously been used occasionally in the press.\n\nContinental Illinois was renamed Continental Bank. It continued to exist, with the federal government effectively owning 80% of the company's shares and having the right to obtain the remainder (ultimately exercised in 1989) if losses in the rescue exceeded certain thresholds. The federal government gradually disposed of its ownership interests in Continental Bank, completing the process on June 6, 1991. In 1994, Continental Bank was acquired by BankAmerica in order to broaden the latter's midwestern presence. In 2007, successor bank firm Bank of America has a retail branch and hundreds of back-office employees at Continental's former headquarters on South LaSalle Street in Chicago. Bank of America operates dozens of retail branches in the Chicago area and purchased LaSalle Bank in 2007 to expand its Chicago business and several lines of corporate and investment banking business.\nIn 1984 the Town and Country Mastercard, issued by Continental Illinois Bank, assets were sold to Chemical Bank of New York including the remote credit card servicing centers in Hoffman Estates and Matteson Illinois. After moving the credit card staff out of the Continental facility, the operations were reopened at a new facility and rebranded Chem Credit Services later in 1984.\n\nContinental Illinois Venture Corporation, an investment subsidiary of the bank, formed a semi-independent private equity firm, CIVC Partners, with backing from Bank of America.\n\nPart of the bank's required reserves were held in silver dollars, which provided the opportunity to profit from a rise in silver prices. The holdings, estimated to be 1.5 million silver dollars, was sold to a coin dealer to raise money in the early 1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "2290624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290624", "title": "Bowland College, Lancaster", "text": "Bowland College, Lancaster\n\nBowland College is the oldest and fourth largest constituent college of Lancaster University. The College was named after the Forest of Bowland, to the east of Lancaster. Members of the College are informally referred to as \"Bowlanders\".\n\nBowland was founded alongside Lonsdale College as the first two colleges of the University in 1964. The Bowland and Lonsdale buildings were built as mirror images of each other, but Lonsdale's building was not completed until a year after Bowland's, making Bowland the oldest college on campus .\nAfter Lonsdale's move to south-west campus in 2004, the original Lonsdale building was taken over by Bowland and is today known as \"Bowland North\".\n\nSince 2004 the two colleges have competed in the annual Founders Series, consisting of nineteen sports contested over four days.\n\nThe lady in the College logo, The Bowland Lady, represents the personification of Bowland Forest, and is from a Lancashire map drawn by William Hole for the 1622 edition of a poem \"\"Poly-Olbion, or a Chorographical Description of ... The Renowned Isle of Great Britain\"\", the lifetime's work of Michael Drayton, a friend of Shakespeare. The poem is in the University Library; a copy of the map is in the College bar.\nThe college magazine is also named after \"The Bowland Lady\". The Forest of Bowland was originally called \"Bolland\" and this pronunciation remains common amongst local people living in the forest.\n\nThe JCR motto is \"Bowland Til I Die\".\n\nThe College has 641 study bedrooms overall, over two-fifths of which are en-suite. The standard residences in \"Bowland Main\" and \"Bowland North\", along the North Spine, accommodate sociable kitchens shared between 16 and 26 people, and are situated around the College's main quadrangles. In contrast, \"Bowland Hall\" offers en-suite residences in a tranquil location by the tree-lined perimeter road; just four students share each flat.\n\nUntil 1995 the College occupied its main building, centred on its main quad, \"Bowland Tower\" and also \"Bowland Annexe\" which consisted of two wings overlooking Alexandra Square. In 1995 \"Slaidburn House\" was completed providing extra accommodation for the College to the south of \"Alexandra Square\".\n\nIn 2004 the College named its main building \"Bowland Main\" and took over the space to its immediate north, which had been vacated by Lonsdale College. This was renamed \"Bowland North\". In the same year the College gained the upper floors of \"Assistant Staff House\" and \"Graduate Hall\", which was renamed \"Bowland Hall\".\n\"Bowland Annexe\" was renamed \"Bowland Tower East\" and \"Bowland Tower North\"; the College also acquired the Art Department building, which was subsequently renamed \"Bowland Annexe\".\n\nBowland Annexe has 35 rooms on C floor, with two kitchens, one female bathroom and one male bathroom to share among the residents. \nThere are three shower spaces and three toilets in the female bathroom.\n\nHeater is present in all the rooms and in the bathrooms. There are approximately seven fire doors on the floor in the hallway and a fire drill takes place once a week. Residents with rooms overlooking Lancaster Square and Country Main can also enjoy the wind turbine view from their rooms.\n\nThe ground floor and first floor of Bowland Annexe belongs to the Arts Department, chemical smells should be expected upon entering the entrance. There is only one elevator that goes to the first floor, individuals should be prepared to move their luggage and belongings up the stairs. The third floor, also known as C floor, and the fourth floor, known as D floor are the main residency area. Each room has their own washing basins.\n\nParts of this estate were lent to other Colleges during building projects, but Bowland regained Slaidburn House in 2007, which is the accommodation above the campus Spar.\n\nBowland Tower will be officially opened during Lent Term, January 2014 to students who now reside in Ash House. \nBowland Bar, known as the \"Trough Of Bowland\" and Bowland Main received makeovers in October 2011 and are now fully modernised, in keeping with most of the accommodation and bars on campus.\n\nBowland College regularly competes in weekly inter-collegiate sports against the other 8 colleges of Lancaster University. This comes in the form of their 4 men's football teams, 4 lady's netball teams and various bar sports including table tennis, pool and darts.\n\nBowland College won the inter-college trophy, the \"Carter Shield\", in 2006, 2007, 2008 and more recently in 2016. It is also the overall winner of the Founders Trophy, an annual competition between Bowland and Lonsdale, the two founding colleges of Lancaster University. The competition usually takes place during the final term of the academic year, over a four day period. The two colleges compete in various sports including conventional college sports and also sports not usually competed by colleges such as, hockey, basketball, cricket, etc. Bowland has dominated the Founders Trophy since its conception; however, in recent years Lonsdale have found more success in the competition, closing the gap in terms of overall victories.\n\nBowland College has continued to be a main competitor in the Carter Shield and George Wyatt Trophy, in inter-collegiate sports.\n\nEach year, Bowland College takes part in an Intercollegiate quiz along with the other nine colleges at Lancaster University, inspired by University Challenge. In 2018, Bowland College made it through to the final, along with Cartmel College and subsequently won scoring 195-95. \n\nThe University Statutes require the College Syndicate to be formally responsible for the strategic governance of the College. The Syndicate is chaired by the College Principal. Membership comprises all senior members of the College plus the current JCR Executive Officers. An additional 10 junior members may be appointed at the discretion of the Syndicate.\n\nMeeting at least once a year, the Syndicate has overall responsibility for the strategic development and governance of the College, including the welfare of the student members and disciplinary matters. It may also discuss general matters relating to Colleges and the University as they arise, and report College views to University Senate, the governing academic body of the University.\n\nIn practice, most decisions relating to the day-to-day running of the College are discussed and determined at Management Committee meetings. The Management Committee reports to the Syndicate. \nMembership consists of several senior officers, plus the JCR President and Vice-President.\n\nThe Junior Common Room Executive, a standing committee of the Students' Union, consists of 15 students and is elected by the undergraduate population of the college. The JCR Exec exists to represent students' views, organise socials and campaigns and provide opportunities for students to get involved in events and activities taking place in the College.\n\nThe precise structure of JCR Executives varies between Lancaster's colleges, but Bowland is unique in having one Vice-President where most colleges have two, and in being the only college with an equality officer. In addition, members of the Executive are officially titled \"representatives\" rather than \"officers\" (though the two are commonly used interchangeably).\n\nThere is a Management Board which oversees the financial management and expenditure of funds received from benefactors: \"The Bowland College Trust Fund\". The Board reports directly to Syndicate.\n"}

An unofficial region, Brewerytown runs approximately between the Schuylkill River's eastern bank and 25th Street, bounded by Cecil B. Moore Avenue to the north and Parrish Street to the south. Brewerytown got its name because of the numerous breweries that were located along the Schuylkill during the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is now primarily a residential neighborhood, with a growing and active commercial sector along Girard Avenue.\n\nThe earliest indications of this legacy can be seen on maps from the 1860s, which list several minor German brewers and distillation facilities in this region. Proximity to the river and nearby farmland allowed these establishments to flourish, and as demands increased, so did development in Brewerytown. By the early 20th century it was a thriving German settlement. Much of the expansion into the early 20th century was handled by architect Otto Wolf, who oversaw the construction of over 60 buildings in the area, bringing a distinct German texture to the houses, saloons, and breweries of the area. Some of his buildings are still standing, including the Bergdoll Brewing complex, and F.A. Poth Brewing. Jefferson Street Grounds, the first home of the Philadelphia Athletics major league baseball team and site of the first ever Major League Baseball game, is located at 27th and Jefferson Streets in the neighborhood. It was also home to famed Columbia Park.\n\nAt its peak, 700 breweries operated across Philadelphia, several in a ten-block area of Brewerytown. Unfortunately, with the collapse of local industry later in the 20th century, originally started by the implementation of Prohibition in the United States, and beer production moving primarily to the Midwest, every single brewer had vanished by 1987. The industry has slowly returned to the city, but at nowhere near the capacity of its heyday. As of 2016, the only active brewery in Brewerytown is Crime & Punishment Brewing, which opened in 2015. During this late 20th-century slump, the entirety of North Philadelphia, Brewerytown included, was hit hard by economic depressions. Much of the area was deemed blighted by the city government. \nIn 1991, the Brewerytown Historic District was certified by the National Register of Historic Places. The district contains 380 buildings and is roughly bounded by Cecil B Moore Ave., Pennsylvania Ave., 25th. and N. 33rd.\n\nBreweries that operated in the neighborhood included: \n\nSEPTA Route 15, a heritage streetcar line, runs through the neighborhood and connects to Girard Station on the Broad Street Line as well as the Market Frankford Line further east at Front Street. Bus Routes 48 and 49 also serve the area, traveling along North 29th Street between the Strawberry Mansion and Fairmount neighborhoods and crossing the Benjamin Franklin Parkway to and from Center City\n\n\n"}

USI is the only university in Switzerland where the official language is Italian. It counts four Faculties at the Lugano campus (Communication Sciences, Economics, Informatics, and Biomedical Sciences), and the Academy of Architecture at the Mendrisio campus. Affiliated to USI, since 2010, are the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) and, from 2017, the Institute of Oncology Research (IOR), both located in the Bellinzona. As of 2019, USI is ranked 301-350 in the THE World University Rankings 2020.\n\nUSI is active in several studies and research areas: architecture, communication sciences, computational science, data science, economics, health studies, humanities, informatics, law, medicine and biomedicine. The university is organised in five Departments (Faculties), located on three campuses. The Faculties of Economics, Communication Sciences, Informatics and Biomedical Sciences are located on the Lugano campus, home also to the Facoltà di Teologia di Lugano, a private institution affiliated with the Diocese of the Catholic Church in Lugano. The Accademia di architettura is located on the Mendrisio campus. The affiliated Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) and the Institute of Oncology Research (IOR) are both located in Bellinzona.\n\nThe Academy of Architecture, founded by acclaimed Swiss architect Mario Botta, is currently headed by Director Riccardo Blumer. With forty lecturers and twenty-five design studios (including Mario Botta, Massimo Carmassi, Valerio Olgiati), the Accademia di architettura trains an overall of 764 students for 3-year Bachelor and 2-year master's degrees (2013).\n\nThe Faculty of Economics is headed by dean Gianluca Colombo. 856 students (2018). Main research and teaching topics include: Banking, Finance, Management, Economics and International Policies, Financial Communication, Marketing.\n\nThe Faculty of Communication Sciences is headed by dean Andrea Rocci. It is the third largest faculty of USI with 763 students enrolled in the autumn semester 2018-2019. Topics of research and teaching include Media, new media and journalism, Marketing, Corporate Communication, Public communication, Healthcare communication, Information and communication technologies, Education and Tourism.\n\nThe Faculty of Informatics was founded by Mehdi Jazayeri and established in 2004. The current dean is Professor Antonio Carzaniga. It is ranked first in Europe for software engineering, according to CSrankings.\n\nFirst year students cover mathematical topics, computer architecture, networking, and fundamental concepts of programming. A further course persists throughout the 3-year undergraduate curriculum.\n\nStudents are expected to learn about a wide variety of topics, from big O notation and calculus, through networking protocols and layers, to computer architecture. A variety of programming languages are used. Programming is introduced through Scheme and functional programming throughout the first semester, in parallel with the computer architecture course (which uses MIPS assembly). Later on, C, Java, and JavaScript are used. The curriculum puts a strong emphasis on teamwork, with a major group project happening at the end of every semester.\n\nMaster topics include Software Design, Software Architecture, Dependable Distributed Systems, Embedded System Design (\"see ALaRI\"), Intelligent Systems (\"with IDSIA\"), Applied Informatics..\n\nThe Institute of Computational Science (ICS), a research unit of the Faculty, was founded in 2008 and is directed by Professor Rolf Krause. The Institute is the result of the vision of USI to become a new scientific and educational centre for Computational Science in Switzerland. The Institute offers research and teaching in Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Simulation, and High Performance Computing. The ICS hosts seven research groups which focus on advanced computing in computational science, high-performance methods for numerical simulation in science, medicine and engineering, computational time series analysis, computational shape analysis, multiscale and multiphysics models in computational biology, computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology, and the simulation of biological and physical systems. The Computational Science Master of Science graduate program at the ICS emphasizes a mathematical and methodological framework as well as an application-oriented education in Informatics and Software Engineering.\n\nThe Faculty of Biomedical Sciences at USI was established in 2014, with the purpose to make a contribution towards the solution of an important problem in Switzerland: the dearth of physicians trained in Switzerland. The new Faculty offers a master's degree in Medicine (3-year curriculum), starting in 2020, in close collaboration with ETH Zurich, University of Basel and University of Zurich on the academic side, and with the \"Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale\" (EOC) and private clinics in Ticino for bedside teaching.\n\n\nUSI adheres to the education system established with the Bologna Process, offering three-year undergraduate programmes (Bachelor) and two-year graduate programmes (Master). In addition, USI organises a selection of doctoral schools and, in the field of continuing education, a number of Executive Master programmes.\n\nBachelor study curricula are offered in five disciplines: Architecture, Communication Sciences, Economics, Informatics and Italian Language, Literature and Civilisation.\n\nTwenty three Master study curricula are offered in fields of specialisation related to the research institutes of the USI Faculties: Architecture, Italian Literature, Finance, Management, Political Economics, International Policies, Health Communication and Management, Corporate Communication, Marketing, International Tourism, Financial Communication, Public Management, Computational Science, Embedded and Cyberphysical Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Software and Data Engineering, and Financial Technology and Computing.\n\nDoctoral schools are at the heart of research conducted at USI and are offered in Finance, Communication Sciences, Informatics, Architecture, Economics, Immunology, Drug design, and Cancer Biology and Oncology\n\nUniversità della Svizzera italiana confers, since 2003, honorary degrees to distinguished academics during its annual \"Dies academicus,\" including Robert F. Engle (Economics), Jimmy Wales (Communication Sciences), Barbara H. Liskov (Informatics), Mimmo Paladino (Architecture), and many others.\n\nThe first plan for a public university in Ticino dates to the founding of the Canton, when in 1801 the Cantonal Diet decided for the establishment in Lugano of either a University or an Academy. The project of an \"Accademia Cantonale\" was further developed in the 1840s by Stefano Franscini. Although in 1844 the Grand Council approved with an overwhelming majority the bill to establish the institution, the \"Accademia\" was never established due to financial problems and more urgent issues with other sections of public education.\n\nThe immediate predecessor to the current USI was the project that began in 1970 for an institute of higher-education focused on post-graduate continuing education and based on Regional Science and on the Humanities titled \"Centro Universitario della Svizzera Italiana\" (CUSI).\n\nCarlo Speziali, then Councilor of State, was the main promoter of CUSI. However, although a bill about CUSI was passed by the Grand Council on 11 December 1985, a committee led by Augusto Bolla and UDC deputy Giovanni Maria Staffieri launched a referendum against it. The committee formed in favor of CUSI drew on the earlier legacy of Franscini, to demonstrate the historical necessity of higher-education in Ticino.\n\nDespite the support that the project of CUSI had received by the Canton, on 20 April 1986 CUSI was turned down by the public vote: at a 41,5% turnout, voters rejected the bill with 47,011 votes, against 21,512 votes that went in favor of it. This controversial result was received by public institutions in Ticino as a threat to the hopes for the development of higher education outside of the German and French speaking regions.\n\nFollowing the defeat of CUSI, several new groups and institutions at different levels of government and civil society began formulating alternative proposals for a university based in Ticino.\n\nOn 27 October 1990 Swiss Federal Councilor Flavio Cotti gave a speech in Poschiavo on multilingualism where he clearly supported the idea of a public university in the Italian-speaking Switzerland, this time however as a full-fledged institute of higher-education supported by a favorable economic growth. Cotti's speech echoed the manifesto that a group of politicians, scholars, and professionals published on 30 May 1990 on \"Libera Stampa\", the newspaper of the Socialist Party. The group consisted of linguists Alessio Petralli and Stefano Vassere, economists Mauro Baranzini and Christian Marazzi, politician Rossano Bervini, Franco Cavalli, Mauro Martinoni, Silvano Toppi, Mauro Wolf.\n\nAt the Cantonal level, the Ticino Government appointed architect and scholar Pier Giorgio Gerosa as delegate for university problems. In the spring of 1990, from this institutional position and in a period of ongoing debates about the presence of multilingualism in the Swiss Federal Constitution, Gerosa asked the Swiss University Conference to contemplate the possibility of an academic institution in Italian-speaking Switzerland. Furthermore, beginning in December 1991 Gerosa drafted a series of reports to demonstrate the case for a university with as many as four departments.\n\nAt the Federal level, in 1992 the ETH Board commissioned architect Mario Botta to draft a project for a national academy of architecture, which however would not be approved. In response to this rejection, Botta brought the project to the attention of the Ticino Government, which reviewed it positively in May 1993. Consequentially this event brought about friction between the Government and Pier Giorgio Gerosa, which led eventually to Gerosa's dismissal.\n\nMeanwhile, between 1992 and 1993 the \"Istituto Accademico di Teologia di Lugano\" was established under the support of Catholic Bishop Eugenio Corecco. Although private institutions of higher education were already present at that point in Ticino - one example of which was the English-speaking Franklin University Switzerland - the initiative of the Catholic Church would be recognized as the first contribution towards a university in Italian-speaking Switzerland.\n\nIn the following years, the project for a university was further developed by dedicated parliamentary commissions. In 1994 a group of Mauro Baranzini, Sergio Cigada, and Lanfranco Senn drafted a project for the Departments of Economics and of Communication Sciences. In the same year the Council of State of the Canton Ticino approved dispatch n° 4308 pertaining the Bill for the \"Università della Svizzera italiana\", which in twelve articles outlined the structure of the future institution, to be built around the \"Accademia di Architettura\" and with the contribution of private financing. A pivotal role in building consensus for this bill was played by Counselor of State Giuseppe Buffi. On Tuesday 3 October 1995, at 19:11, the Grand Council of Ticino approved the bill that established USI, with seventy-three of eighty favorable votes.\n\nAfter twelve months of preparations, on 21 October 1996 USI opened its doors in Lugano and Mendrisio to the first class of students. Marco Baggiolini was appointed to serve as USI's first President. Mauro Dell'Ambrogio, who was the author of the bill, and who thus had previously played an important role on the side of Giuseppe Buffi - the Ticino Councilor of State at the head of the \"Dipartimento dell'Istruzione e della Cultura\" (Department of Education) - was appointed to serve as USI's first General Secretary. In 2000 USI granted its first degrees, concluding the first cycle of studies, thus meeting the acknowledgement of Federal authorities. In 2004 the Faculty of Informatics was established. In 2006, Marco Baggiolini was succeeded by Piero Martinoli. In 2014 the Government of the Canton Ticino approved the creation of the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences. In 2015, a new governance structure of USI was announced, with the position of President turned into a Rectorship. In 2016, Boas Erez was appointed Rector of USI, succeeding Piero Martinoli, and the new governance model was confirmed, including the appointment of two Pro-Rectors and the institution of an Academic Senate.\n\nThe Lugano campus developed around the existing city hospital circa 1996. Several state-of-the-art buildings have been added, most notably Informatics (2007), Aula Magna, Aule, Library, and LAB.\n\nThe main building consists of four floors containing: Communications and Economics offices (1-3), the Executive Centre, four computer labs (1), classrooms (1-3), the cafeteria (2)(Q1-2007), and third-floor auditorium (3)(Q3-2007). The library is four floors tall. The LAB has 5 floors, in great part occupied by the Institute of Computational Sciences, and the rest by other Communication Sciences and Informatics departments.\nThe \"Aule\" building, informally known as \"Palazzo Rosso\" (\"Red Building\"), hosts six classrooms on each of its three floors, and is commonly used for Economics and Communication Sciences courses. The modern-looking concrete and metal Informatics building finished in 2007 contains classrooms (1), offices and study areas reserved for CS students and mentors (2-3).The \"Aula Magna\" is the university's convention hall and capable of seating around 400 people; it is used to host university conferences, speeches, and other public or private events; solely the entrance to the hall is visible above ground. South of the main building, the Central Services offices houses the Rectorate (as of September 1, 2016, until then the Presidency), the Institute for Italian Studies, and core units of the university such as the Media and Communication Service (press office), and the Research Service. Adjacent to the Rectorate building is the so-called \"Blue building\", formerly home to the Cantonal laboratory, and today occupied by a number of research institutes of the Faculty of Economics, with offices for faculty, PhD students, assistants, and related administrative staff.\n\nUniversità della Svizzera italiana has 2815 students in 2018-2019; of these 981 (34,85%) are Swiss, and 1834 (65,15%) are foreign.\n\nOff-campus, students participate in city-sponsored tourism events, school-sponsored sporting activities, and student associations, despite the town's small population. Around twenty student associations have been established, with student clubs oriented around economics (AIESEC), informatics (EESTEC, IEEE student branch), and communications (L'universo student newspaper).\n\n\n"}

He was chosen by the Parliament of Singapore in 1970. Before becoming head-of-state, Yusof was a well-known journalist and co-founded \"Utusan Melayu\", which was in circulation till 9 October 2019. He started journalism after he graduated from Raffles Institution in 1929 and in 1932, he joined Warta Malaya, a well-known Malay newspaper company at that time. He left the company in 1938 and co-founded \"Utusan Melayu\".\n\nTun Yusof held many appointments within the Singaporean government. He served on the Film Appeal Committee from 1948 to 1950 and was also a member of both the Nature Reserves Committee and Malayanisation Commission for a year. In July 1959, he was appointed Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Singapore. He was sworn on 3 December 1959 as Singapore's \"Yang di-Pertuan Negara\" (head of state) after the PAP won the first election held in Singapore after Singapore's self-governance. Yusof then became the first President of Singapore after the country gained independence on 9 August 1965.\n\nHis portrait appears on the Singapore Portrait Series currency notes introduced in 1999.\n\nBorn on 12 August 1910 in Kampung Padang Gajah, Terong, Taiping, Perak Darul Ridzuan, which was then part of the Federated Malay States (present day Malaysia), Yusof was the eldest son in a family of nine. He was of Minangkabau descent from his father's side while his mother was a Malay from the Langkat region in Indonesia. His father, Ishak bin Ahmad, was also a civil servant and held the post of Acting Director of Fisheries, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States. His brother, Aziz Ishak, was a Malayan journalist and freedom fighter.\n\nYusof received his early education in a Malay school in Kuala Kurau, Perak and began his English studies in 1921 at King Edward VII School in Taiping, He was then admitted to Victoria Bridge School in 1923 when his father was posted to Singapore. In 1924, he was enrolled in Raffles Institution for his secondary education. During his time in Raffles Institution, he played various sports such as swimming, weight lifting, water-polo, boxing, hockey and cricket and had also represented the school in various sporting events. He was also part of the Singapore National Cadet Corps and was commissioned as the first ever cadet officer in the Corps due to his outstanding performance. Yusof received his Cambridge School Certificate with distinction in 1927, he was also awarded the Queen's Scholarship and decided to prolong his studies at Raffles Institution until 1929.\n\nAfter graduating from Raffles Institution in 1929, Yusof began his career as a journalist and went into partnership with two other friends to publish, \"Sportsman\", a sports magazine devoted entirely to sports. In 1932, Yusof joined \"Warta Malaya\", a well-known newspaper during that time. \"Warta Malaya\" was heavily influenced by developments in the Middle East and Yusof wanted a newspaper dedicated to Malay issues. He fulfilled his vision by establishing \"Utusan Melayu\" with several Malay leaders in Singapore in May 1939.\n\nDuring the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, \"Utusan Melayu\" had to stop circulation as machinery used to print the paper were requisitioned to publish the Japanese paper, \"Berita Malai\". Yusof then moved back to Taiping and with the remaining money he had, he opened a provision shop and lived there until the war ended in 1945 and \"Utusan Melayu\" resumed publication. In 1957, Yusof moved to Kuala Lumpur and in February 1958, the headquarters of \"Utusan Melayu\" was also relocated to the city. During the post-war period, many Malays wanted independence of Malaya from the British and Yusof, fanned this fervour through his publications which resulted in the formation of the United Malay Nationalist Organisation (UMNO) in 1946. However, his democratic ideals were different from UMNO's vision of reestablishing the monarchy of Malaya. This resulted in rising tensions within the \"Utusan Melayu\" and in 1959, Yusof had sold his shares he had in the company and resigned as UMNO had bought over almost all of the shares of \"Utusan Melayu\".\n\nYusof held several appointments within the Singaporean government, he had served on the Film Appeal Committee from 1948 to 1950 and was also a member of both the Nature Reserves Committee and Malayanisation Commission for a year. After his resignation from \"Utusan Melayu\", Yusof took the position of Chairman of the Public Service Commission of Singapore at the invitation of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nAfter PAP's victory from the 1959 Singaporean elections, Yusof was appointed as Yang di-Pertuan Negara and was sworn on 3 December 1959. During his time as Yang di-Pertuan Negara, Singapore was divided by racial conflicts. Yusof actively promoted multiculturalism and reached out to people of all races to help restore trust and confidence after the 1964 racial riots.\n\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore was expelled from Malaysia and became an independent nation. The position of Yang di-Pertuan Negara was abolished and Yusof then became the first President of Singapore. As president, Yusof reached out to the people to reassure citizens astonished by Singapore's expulsion and continued to promote multiculturalism and a national identity within the country by visiting constituencies and reached out to different racial and religious groups.\n\nYusof served for three terms in office before he died on 23 November 1970 due to heart failure.\n\nYusof is survived by his wife of twenty one years, Puan Noor Aishah, and their three children, Orkid Kamariah, Imran, and Zuriana. Puan Noor Aishah continued her husband's legacy of public service and was the first Asian to become president of the Singapore Girl Guides Association. She and her now adult children were interviewed for the Channel NewsAsia documentary \"Daughters of Singapore\", which screened in August 2015 as part of the SG50 celebrations and commemorated the spouses of Yusof Ishak and David Marshall, two pioneer leaders of Singapore.\n\nYusof participated in several sports in his youth. He won the Aw Boon Par Cup for boxing in 1932, and was the national lightweight champion in weightlifting in 1933. One of Yusof's hobbies was photography, and a collection of his photographs was donated to the National Archives of Singapore by his widow, Noor Aishah. He also cultivated orchids, and had the tennis courts at his residence on the Istana grounds, Sri Melati, converted into an orchid garden. He performed the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1963.\n\nThe following institutions bear Yusof Ishak's name:\n\n\nOther memorials include:\n\n\n\n"}

The area is roughly bounded by the edge of Luton to the north, Vauxhall Way and Turners Road North to the south, Bradgers Hill to the west, and Cannon Lane, Stapleford Road and Brays Road to the east.\n\nFrederick Davis, writing in 1965 believed the name of Stospley to come from Scrobbale, (in Saxon;) Scrapes or Scroppeslie, (in Norman;) Shrubsley, (in English.;) meaning a hill covered with scrobbes (shrubs or underwood.) Most modern etymologists consider the name to be made up of two elements 'Stopp' and 'ley'. dating between AD 750 and AD 950. The ending comes from the Old English 'leah' meaning a wood or clearing in a wood. 'Stopp' was a personal name and indicated ownership of the wood or clearing.\nIt appears as 'Stopeslegh in Soca de Luton' in a (Latin) law record, dated 1440.\n\nhaadihayat\n\nOriginally a hill-top village settlement, most of the urbanised part of the civil parish of Stopsley became part of Luton when the boundaries were extended in 1933, with the rural areas going to Hyde and Streatley.\n\nThe centre of Stopsley is made up of a series of local shops around a village church. From a distance the skyline is dominated by Jansel House, an office block built in 1961 which houses the Luton VAT office over a parade of shops at street level including a Greengrocer, Chemist, Charity Shop. Estate Agent, hairdresser and cafe. One of Luton's two cemeteries, The Vale, is located nearby on the Hitchin Road.\n\nThe centre of Stopsley Village contains many shops on either side of the road including a Barclays branch (now closed), Co-Operative supermarket, Henderson newsagents (now closed), Cafe, Tesco Express, Chemist, Hardware, charity shops, Sandwich stores and Off licences/Wine stores. There are also several takeaways and restaurants such as; Ashuka, Stopsley Surma, May Sek Oriental, Jay Raj Indian Cuisine, Pankaj Sor.

The species is endemic to Australia. Originally described by George Shaw in 1794 as a species new to science, it is one of eastern Australia's most commonly encountered snakes. Averaging around in length, it has glossy black upperparts, bright red or orange flanks, and a pink or dull red belly. It is not an aggressive species and generally retreats from encounters with people, but can attack if provoked. Although its venom is capable of causing significant illness, no deaths have been recorded from its bite, which is less venomous than other Australian elapid snakes. The venom contains neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants and has haemolytic properties; victims can also lose their sense of smell.\n\nCommon in woodlands, forests and swamplands, the red-bellied black snake often ventures into nearby urban areas. It forages in bodies of shallow water, commonly with tangles of water plants and logs, where it hunts its main prey item, frogs, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. The snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat fragmentation and decline of frog populations.\n\nThe red-bellied black snake was first described and named by English naturalist George Shaw in \"Zoology of New Holland\" (1794) as \"Coluber porphyriacus\". Incorrectly assuming it was harmless, he wrote, \"This beautiful snake, which appears to be unprovided with tubular teeth or fangs, and consequently not of a venomous nature, is three, sometimes four, feet in nature.\" The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek \"porphyreus\", which can mean \"dark purple\", \"red-purple\" or \"beauteous\". It was the first Australian elapid snake described. The syntype is presumed lost. French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède described it under the name \"Trimeresurus leptocephalus\" in 1804. His countryman René Lesson described it as \"Acanthophis tortor\" in 1826. German biologist Hermann Schlegel felt it was allied with cobras and called it \"Naja porphyrica\" in 1837.\nThe genus \"Pseudechis\" was created for it by German biologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1830, to which several more species have been added subsequently. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"pseudēs\" \"false\", and \"echis\" \"viper\". Snake expert Eric Worrell, in 1961, analysed the skulls of the genus and found that of the red-bellied black snake to be the most divergent. Its position as an early offshoot from the rest of the genus has been confirmed genetically in 2017.\n\nSnake handler Raymond Hoser described two extra subspecies in 2003: \"P. p. eipperi\" from the Atherton Tableland and surrounds in north-east Queensland, which he noted was smaller, rarely attaining 2 m (7 ft) and had a white or pale pink rather than red belly, and \"P. p. rentoni\" from southeastern South Australia, which has a variably coloured (often orange or even blueish-tinged) belly. He added that both were disjunct from the main red-bellied black snake population, and as the distinguishing traits of \"P. p. rentoni\" were not consistent, then location was the most reliable way of identifying it. These subspecies have not been recognized by other authors, and Hoser has been strongly criticized for identifying some taxa on location alone, and omitting, misinterpreting or inventing evidence of distinctness.\n\nIn addition to red-bellied black snake, the species has been called common black snake, redbelly, and RBBS. It was known as \"djirrabidi\" to the Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin.\n\nThe red-bellied black snake has a glossy black top body with a light-grey snout and brown mouth, and a completely black tail. It lacks a well-defined neck; its head merges seamlessly into the body. Its flanks are bright red or orange, fading to pink or dull red on the belly. All these scales have black margins. Snakes from northern populations tend to have lighter, more cream or pink bellies. The red-bellied black snake is on average around long, the largest individual recorded at . Males are generally slightly larger than females. A large specimen caught in Newcastle has been estimated to weigh around . The red-bellied black snake can have a strong smell, which some field experts have used to find the snakes in the wild.\n\nLike all elapid snakes, it is proteroglyphous (front-fanged). Juveniles are similar to the eastern small-eyed snake (\"Cryptophis nigrescens\"), with which it can be easily confused, although the latter species lacks the red flanks. Other similar species include the blue-bellied black snake (\"Pseudechis guttatus\") and copperheads of the genus \"Austrelaps\". An early misconception was that the red-bellied black snake was sexually dimorphic, and that the eastern brown snake (\"Pseudonaja textilis\") was the female form. This was recognised as such by Australian zoologist Gerard Krefft in his 1869 work \"Snakes of Australia\".\n\nThe number and arrangement of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The red-bellied black snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 180 to 215 ventral scales, 48 to 60 subcaudal scales (the anterior—and sometimes all—subcaudals are undivided), and a divided anal scale. There are two anterior and two posterior temporal scales, and the rostral shield is roughly square-shaped.\n\nThe red-bellied black snake is native to the east coast of Australia, where it is one of the most commonly encountered snakes. It can be found in the urban forest, woodland, plains, and bushland areas of the Blue Mountains, Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Cairns, and Adelaide. The Macquarie Marshes mark a western border to its distribution in New South Wales, and Gladstone in central Queensland marks the northern limit to the main population. To the south, it occurs across eastern and central Victoria, and extends along the Murray River into South Australia. Disjunct populations occur in the southern Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia and in North Queensland.\n\nThe red-bellied black snake is most commonly seen close to dams, streams, billabongs, and other bodies of water, although they can venture up to away,\nincluding into nearby backyards. In particular, the red-bellied black snake prefers areas of shallow water with tangles of water plants, logs, or debris.\n\nRed-bellied black snakes can hide in many places in their habitat, including logs, old mammal burrows, and grass tussocks. They can flee into water and hide there; one was reported as staying submerged for 23 minutes. When swimming, they may hold their full head or the nostrils above the water's surface. At times, they may float without moving on the water surface, thus looking like a stick. Within their habitat, red-bellied black snakes appear to have ranges or territories with which they are familiar and generally remain within. A 1987 field study in three New South Wales localities found that these areas vary widely, from in size. Within their territory, they may have some preferred places to reside.\n\nThe red-bellied black snake is generally not an aggressive species, typically withdrawing when approached. If provoked, it recoils into a striking stance as a threat, holding its head and front part of its body horizontally above the ground and widening and flattening its neck. It may bite as a last resort. It is generally active by day, though nighttime activity has occasionally been recorded. When not hunting or basking, it may be found beneath timber, rocks, and rubbish or down holes and burrows.\n\nSnakes are active when their body temperatures are between . They also thermoregulate by basking in warm, sunny spots in the cool, early morning and rest in shade in the middle of hot days, and may reduce their activity in hot, dry weather in late summer and autumn. Rather than entering true hibernation, red-bellied black snakes become relatively inactive over winter, retreating to cover and at times emerging on warm, sunny days. Their dark colour allows them to absorb heat from sunshine more quickly. In July 1949, six large individuals were found hibernating under a concrete slab in marshland in Woy Woy, New South Wales. Groups of up to six hibernating red-bellied black snakes have been recorded from under concrete slabs around Mount Druitt and Rooty Hill in western Sydney. Males are more active in the Southern Hemisphere spring (early October to November) as they roam looking for mates; one reportedly travelled in a day. In summer, both sexes are less active generally.\n\nIn spring, male red-bellied black snakes often engage in ritualised combat for 2 to 30 minutes, even attacking other males already mating with females. They wrestle vigorously, but rarely bite, and engage in head-pushing contests, where each snake tries to push his opponent's head downward with his chin.\n\nThe male seeks out a female and rubs his chin on her body, and may twitch, hiss, and rarely bite as he becomes aroused. The female indicates readiness to mate by straightening out and allowing their bodies to align. Pregnancy takes place any time from early spring to late summer. Females become much less active and band together in small groups in late pregnancy. They share the same retreat and bask in the sun together. The red-bellied black snake is ovoviviparous; that is, it gives birth to live young in individual membranous sacs, after 14 weeks' gestation, usually in February or March. The young, numbering between eight and 40, emerge from their sacs very shortly after birth, and have an average length around . Young snakes almost triple their length and increase their weight 18-fold in their first year of life, and are sexually mature when they reach SVL (snoutvent length) of for males or for females. Females can breed at around 31 months of age, while males can slightly earlier. Red-bellied black snakes can live up to 25 years.\n\nThe diet of red-bellied black snakes primarily consists of frogs, but they also prey on reptiles and small mammals. They also eat other snakes, including those of their own species. Fish are hunted in water. Red-bellied black snakes may hunt on or under the water surface, and prey can be eaten underwater or brought to the surface. They have been recorded stirring up substrate, possibly to disturb prey. As red-bellied black snakes grow and mature, they continue to eat the same size prey, but add larger animals, as well. Although they prefer live food, red-bellied black snakes have been reported eating frogs squashed by cars.\n\nThey are susceptible to cane toad (\"Rhinella marina\") toxins. The introduction of cane toads in Australia dates to 1935, when they were introduced in an attempt at biological control of native beetles, which were damaging sugarcane fields (a non-native plant). The intervention failed, mostly because the toads are on the ground, while the beetles feed on leaves at the top of the plant. One research study concluded that in less than 75 years, the red-bellied black snake had evolved in toad-inhabited regions of Australia to have increased resistance to toad toxin and decreased preference for toads as prey.\n\nEarly settlers feared the red-bellied black snake, though it turned out to be much less dangerous than many other species. The murine median lethal dose (LD) is 2.52 mg/kg when administered subcutaneously. A red-bellied black snake yields an average of 37 mg of venom when milked, with the maximum recorded being 94 mg. It accounted for 16% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, with no deaths recorded. Its venom contains neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants and also has haemolytic properties.\nBites from red-bellied black snakes can be very painful—needing analgesia—and result in local swelling, prolonged bleeding, and even local necrosis, particularly if the bite is on a finger. Severe local reactions may require surgical debridement or even amputation. Symptoms of systemic envenomation—including nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or excessive sweating—were thought to be rare, but a 2010 review found they occurred in most bite victims. Most people also go on to develop an anticoagulant coagulopathy in a few hours. This is characterised by a raised activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and subsides over 24 hours. It resolves quickly with antivenom. A few people go on to develop a myotoxicity and associated generalised muscle pain and occasionally weakness, which may last up to 7 days. Patients may suffer a loss of sense of smell (anosmia); this is unrelated to the severity of the envenoming and can be temporary or permanent. Although the venom contains the three-finger toxin α-elapitoxin-Ppr1, which acts as a neurotoxin in laboratory experiments, neurotoxic symptoms are generally absent in clinical cases.\n\nA biologically active agent—pseudexin—was isolated from red-bellied black snake venom in 1981. Making up 25% of the venom, it is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight around 16.5 kilodaltons. In 1989, it was found to be composed of three phospholipase A2 isoenzymes. If antivenom is indicated, red-bellied black snake bites are generally treated with tiger snake antivenom. While black snake antivenom can be used, tiger snake antivenom can be used at a lower volume and is a cheaper treatment.\n\nIt is the most commonly reported species responsible for envenomed dogs in New South Wales. In 2006, a 12-year-old golden retriever suffered rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury secondary to a red-bellied black snake bite. Laboratory testing has found that cats are relatively resistant to the venom, with a lethal dose as high as 7 mg/kg.\n\nThe red-bellied black snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Its preferred habitat has been particularly vulnerable to urban development and is highly fragmented, and a widespread decline in frogs, which are its preferred prey, has occurred. Snake numbers appear to have declined. Feral cats are known to prey on red-bellied black snakes, while young snakes presumably are taken by laughing kookaburras (\"Dacelo novaeguineae\"), brown falcons (\"Falco berigora\"), and other raptors.\n\nOne of the snakes commonly kept as pets in Australia, the red-bellied black snake adapts readily to captivity and lives on a supply of mice, though it can also survive on fish fillets, chicken, and dog food.\n\n"}

Since 1981, it has helped lower tariffs affecting radio stations and assisted new stations to launch, as well as to obtain operating funds. Core initiatives include GroundWire, \"Dig Your Roots\", \"!earshot\", Women’s Hands and Voices, the Community Radio Fund of Canada, sector-wide listservs, and an annual radio conference. \n\nThe head office of the NCRA/ANREC is located in Ottawa. A majority of English-language campus and community radio stations in Canada are members of the NCRA.\n\nIn February 1981, the first National Campus Radio Conference (NCRC) was held in Ottawa, hosted by CKCU. At that conference, the National Campus/Community Radio Organization (NCRO) was formed to promote campus radio across Canada. In August 1983, NCRC delegates voted to formalize the structure of the NCRO further and to establish a volunteer office to carry out a variety of services for member stations. The office initially operated from CKCU-FM, at Carleton University in Ottawa. That year the \"Alternative Radio News Service\", a regular mailout of alternative news and information to campus and community stations, was started at CKMS-FM at the University of Waterloo.\n\nIn the early years, the NCRO published a monthly newsletter and alternative album chart. It also made presentations to the CRTC on a number of issues relating to community radio in Canada, including efforts to reduce content restrictions the CRTC had placed on the limited form of commercial advertising allowed on campus and community stations at the time. The organization was also actively involved in assisting the growing number of campus-based radio groups applying for FM radio licenses in the early 1980s.\n\nIn July 1986 the NCRO was incorporated as the National Campus and Community Radio Association Inc./L'Association nationale de radios étudiantes et communautaires Inc. (NCRA/ANREC). In the early 1990s, there was a national office and executive director for a short period of time, but due to lack of stable funding, among other problems, the office closed after less than one year. In February 2002, a new office was formed in Montreal with a national coordinator, which moved to Ottawa in May 2005, where it currently operates.\n\nThe Canadian music magazine \"Chart\" was founded as an internal NCRA/ANREC publication; when it incorporated as an independent newsstand title, the NCRA began publishing \"!earshot\", which is a regular supplement in \"Exclaim!\". Many campus and community radio stations continue to file airplay charts with both publications.\n\nIn 2001, after Corus Entertainment, a major broadcasting company in Canada, bought out a number of radio stations across Canada, as per federal regulations the CRTC required that they put a total of 6% of the assets from this transfer of ownership towards artist development. The money was given by Corus Entertainment to the NCRA/ANREC to start up and maintain the \"Dig Your Roots/Découvre tes racines\" project, a series of genre-specific compilation albums that coincided with live concert simulcast broadcasts. Dig Your Roots concluded in 2007.\n\nThe NCRC is an annual national gathering of community-oriented radio broadcasters. It has been offered every summer since 1981, and it is one of the core activities of the NCRA/ANREC. It is usually hosted by a different radio station in different locations each year. During the conference, delegates attend workshops, seminars, the annual general meeting of the NCRA (during which board members are elected, the treasurer's report is approved, the business of the association is accomplished by the membership, and the next conference's host radio station selected), seminars, live shows, and feature presentations. \n\nUp until 2012, a Women in Radio Conference was held during the national conference. This was replaced with the Equity Radio Day to be held on a weekend during the conference.\n\n\n\n"}

They achieved success in the UK charts with four top-20 hits, the biggest being \"Too Good to Be Forgotten\" in 1986.\n\nThe name Amazulu is taken from the Zulu language word for the Zulu people, also meaning Mother of the Zulus. They originally wanted to be named Amazon but an American rock band already had the name. The name Amazulu came about when Sharon and Lesley went to see a South African play by the same name and met with the playwright who gave his permission to use the name. The band was started by Sharon Bailey, the band's original manager, Rose Miner, the original lead singer, and Lesley Beach, the saxophone player. All members were female, at first with Debbie Dread on drums. Later Rose was replaced by Anne Marie Ruddock and Debbie was replaced by John \"Nardo\" Bailey, who they called their token male. Rose went on to become a dancer, dance teacher and percussionist. She performed with Quilombo do Samba in the UK and Brazil. Falcon Stuart, the former manager of X-Ray Spex and Adam and the Ants, was one of their early managers and helped promote their first single, \"Cairo\", to modest success in the UK, which included airplay from BBC Radio 1's John Peel.\n\nThe band started gaining appearances on television, including on \"The Young Ones\" (1984) and \"Top of the Pops\" several times, which helped to widen their fame. They achieved hits that included \"Excitable\" and \"Too Good to Be Forgotten\", the latter of which was originally recorded by The Chi-Lites. The band achieved a minor success in the United States with \"Montego Bay\" (a cover of the 1970 song by Bobby Bloom) in 1986; early the next year, it became a surprise hit in Canada, climbing to No. 6 on their singles chart. That year their eponymous full-length album was released on Island Records, although it failed to chart highly.\n\nAmazulu began as a six-piece band, with another woman temporarily joining the band on keyboards for three songs: \"Excitable\", \"The Things The Lonely Do\" and \"Don't You Just Know It\". They were joined by Eddie \"Tan Tan\" Thornton on trumpet. The group trimmed down to a trio of Anne-Marie Ruddock, Sharon Bailey and Lesley Beach during 1986 as they were enjoying their greatest success. In 1987, Beach left the band and Ruddock and Bailey continued as a duo for another year, scoring the minor hit \"Mony Mony\". Afterwards, Amazulu recorded their second album \"Spellbound\" which was released in designated Asian countries including Hong Kong in audio cassette format under EMI Records. The album contained the singles \"Mony Mony\", \"Wonderful World, Beautiful People\" and \"My Heart Belongs to You\" (which was released under Ruddock's name only in 1988). In early 1988 they split.\n\nSharon, Anne Marie and Lesley Ruddock appeared in the 1987 Alex Cox film \"Straight to Hell\". After travelling the world and living in Brazil and Rome, Sharon Bailey now lives in Buckinghamshire. She drums from time to time and is still involved in the music industry. Lesley Beach moved to Tucson, Arizona, after taking a break in the hills of Ibiza with José Padilla. She went on to achieve a Bachelor of Arts degree from Prescott College for the Liberal Arts, the Environment and Social Justice and worked as a social worker in Tucson. Rose and Lesley reunited and played drums and percussion in the Samba band Quilombo do Samba, who won the Best Band in the 2002 Notting Hill Carnival. The band member who achieved the greatest commercial success in music was Clare Kenny, who joined Coming Up Roses and became a session player with Sinéad O'Connor, Shakespears Sister and Damien Dempsey. Margo Sagov went on to graduate as an architect, played guitar with several bands and is currently playing with Rock Candy. \n\nThe band are mentioned in the song \"Asbestos\" by Suede, on their album \"Head Music\".\n"}

{"id": "2290752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290752", "title": "Religion in Spain", "text": "Religion in Spain\n\nThe major religion in Spain has been Catholic Christianity since the Reconquista, with a small minority of other Christian and non-Christian religions and high levels of secularization . The Pew Research Center ranked Spain as the 16th out of 34 European countries in levels of religiosity, which is lower than Italy, Portugal and Poland, but much higher than the United Kingdom and the Nordic countries. There is no official religion and religious freedom is protected: the Spanish Constitution of 1978 abolished Catholicism as the official state religion, while recognizing the role it plays in Spanish society. \n\nCatholicism has been present in the Iberian Peninsula since Roman times. The Spanish Empire spread it to the Philippine islands and Latin America, which are now predominantly Catholic countries. However, since the end of the Francoist dictatorship practical secularization has grown strongly. Only 3% of Spaniards consider religion as one of their three most important values, lower than the 5% European average. \n\nA Survey published in 2019 by the Pew Research Center found that 54% of Spaniards had a favorable view of Muslims, while 76% had a favorable view about Jews. Spain has been seen as a \"graveyard for Protestant missionaries\": only 1% of the population of Spain is Protestant and 92% of Spain's 8,131 villages do not have any evangelical protestant church. \n\nAccording to the Spanish Center for Sociological Research, 71.1% of Spanish citizens self-identify as Catholics, (46.6% define themselves as not practising, while 24.5% as practising), 2.3% as followers of other faiths (including Islam, Protestant Christianity, Buddhism etc.), and 25.4% identify as atheists (11.1%), agnostics (6.5%) or non-believers (7.8%) . Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious worship. This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 29.1% never attend mass, 30.8% barely ever attend mass, 16.2% attend mass a few times a year, 7.4% two or three times per month, 13.0% every Sunday holidays, and 2.1% multiple times per week.\n\nAlthough a majority of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, many younger generations ignore the Church's moral doctrines on issues such as pre-marital sex, sexual orientation, marriage or contraception. The total number of parish priests shrank from 24,300 in 1975 to 18,500 in 2018, with an average age of 65.5 years. By contrast, some expressions of popular religiosity still thrive, often linked to local festivals.\n\nWhile Catholicism is still the largest religion in Spain, most Spaniards—and especially the younger—choose not to follow the Catholic teachings in morals, politics or sexuality, and do not attend Mass regularly. Irreligiosity, including agnosticism and atheism, enjoys social prestige in line with the general Western European secularization.\n\nCulture wars in Spain are far more related to politics than religion, and the huge unpopularity of typically religion-related issues like creationism prevent them from being used in such conflicts. Revivalist efforts by the Catholic Church and other creeds have not had any significant success out of their previous sphere of influence. According to the Eurobarometer 83 (2015), only 3% of Spaniards consider religion as one of their three most important values, just like in 2008 and even lower than the 5% European average. And according to the 2005 Eurobarometer Poll:\n\n\nEvidence of the liberal turn in contemporary Spain can be seen in the widespread support for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Spain—over 70% of Spaniards supported gay marriage in 2004 according to a study by the Centre for Sociological Research. Indeed, in June 2005 a bill was passed by 187 votes to 147 to allow gay marriage, making Spain the third country in the European Union to allow same-sex couples to marry. This vote was split along conservative-liberal lines, with Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and other left-leaning parties supporting the measure and the center-to-right People's Party (PP) against it. However, when the Popular Party came into power in 2011, the law was not revoked or modified. Changes to the divorce laws to make the process quicker and to eliminate the need for a guilty party have also been popular. Abortion, contraception and emergency contraception are legal and readily available on par with Western European standards.\n\nSpain is not a traditionally Orthodox country, as after the Great Schism of 1054 the Spanish Christians (at that time controlling the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula) remained in the Catholic sphere of influence.\n\nThe number of Orthodox adherents in the country began to increase in the early 1990s, when Spain experienced an influx of migrant workers from Eastern Europe. The dominant nationality among Spanish Orthodox adherents is Romanian (as many as 0.7 million people), with Bulgarians, Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans, and others bringing the total to about 1.0 million.\n\nProtestantism in Spain has been boosted by immigration, but remains a small testimonial force among native Spaniards (1%). Spain has been seen as a \"graveyard for foreign missionaries\" (meaning lack of success) among Evangelical Protestants. Protestant churches claim to have about 1,200,000 members.\n\nIrreligion in Spain is a phenomenon that exists at least since the 17th century. Atheism, agnosticism and freethinking became relatively popular (although the majority of the society was still very religious) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the Spanish civil war irreligious people were repressed by the Francoist side, while religion was largely abolished among the republicans. During the Francoist dictatorship period (1939-1975) irreligion was not tolerated, following the national-catholic ideology of the regime. Irreligious people could not be public workers or express their thoughts openly. After the Spanish democratic transition (1975-1982), restrictions on irreligion were lifted. In the last decades religious practice has fallen dramatically and atheism and agnosticism have grown in popularity, with over 14 million people (30.3% of the population ) having no religion.\n\nHowever, some expressions of popular religiosity still thrive, often linked to Christian festivals and local patron saints. World-famous examples include the Holy Week in Seville, the Romería de El Rocío in Huelva or the Mystery Play of Elche, while the Sanfermines in Pamplona and the Falles of Valencia have mostly lost their original religious nature. The continuing success of these festivals is the result of a mix of religious, cultural, social and economic factors including sincere devotion, local or family traditions, non-religious fiesta and partying, perceived beauty, cultural significance, territorial identity, meeting friends and relatives, increased sales and a massive influx of tourists to the largest ones. The Pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela is not so popular among Spaniards but it attracts many visitors. Most if not all cities and towns celebrate a patron saint's festival, no matter how small or known, which often includes processions, Mass and the like but whose actual religious following is variable and sometimes merely nominal.\n\nAnother trend among Spanish believers is syncretism, often defined as \"religión a la carta\". In \"religion à la carte\", people mix popular Roman Catholic beliefs and traditions with their own worldview and/or esoteric, self-help, New Age or philosophical borrowings they like, resulting in a unique personal 'soft' spirituality without any possible church. These people typically self-define themselves as Catholics, but they only attend church for christenings, funerals or weddings and are not actual followers. \n\nThe recent waves of immigration, especially during and after the 1990s, have led to an increasing number of Muslims and Protestants. Nowadays, Islam is the second largest religion, but far behind Roman Catholicism and irreligion. A study made by \"Unión de comunidades islámicas de España\" showed that there were almost 1,900,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain in 2016 (4% of the total population). The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other North African/Arab countries. Almost 780,000 of them had Spanish nationality.\n\nJews in Spain account for less than 0.2% of the population, mostly in Barcelona, Madrid and Murcia.\n\nBesides various varieties of Christianity, Islam, Judaism and the non-religious, Spain also has small groups of Hindus, Buddhists, Pagans, Taoists, and Bahá'ís.\n\nHinduism first arrived in Spain by Sindhi immigrants through British colony of Gibraltar in the early 20th century. There are about 40,000-50,000 Hindus in Spain, about 25,000 from India, 5,000 from Eastern Europe and Latin America and 10,000 Spanish. There are also small communities of Hindus from Nepal (around 200) and Bangladesh (around 500). \nThere are also about 40 Hindu temples/worship-places in Spain. The first Hindu temple in Ceuta city was completed in 2007. There are ISKCON Krishna Temples in Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga, Tenerife and Brihuega along with a Krishna restaurant in Barcelona. Some of Hinduism's shared teaching with Buddhism like reincarnation or karma, have partially syncretized with the cultural mainstream via New Age-style movements.\n\nBuddhism didn't arrive in Spain until the late 20th century. According to an estimation, there are around 65,000 followers and an indeterminate number of sympathizers. However, some of its teachings, like reincarnation or karma, have partially syncretized with the cultural mainstream via New Age-style movements.\n\nPaganism draws a minority in Spain. The most visible pagan religions are forms of Germanic Heathenism (Spanish: \"Etenismo\"), Celtic paganism (and Druidry) and Wicca. Spanish Heathen groups include the Odinist Community of Spain–Ásatrú, which identifies as both Odinist and Ásatrú, the Asatru Lore Vanatru Assembly, the Gotland Forn Sed and Circulo Asatrú Tradición Hispánica, of which four, the first one is officially registered by the State; Celtist or Druidic groups include the Dun Ailline Druid Brotherhood (\"Hermandad Druida Dun Ailline\") and the Fintan Druidic Order, both registered. Amongst the Wiccan groups, two have been granted official registration: the Spanish Wiccan Association (\"Asociación Wicca España\") and the Celtiberian Wicca (\"Wicca Tradición Celtíbera\").\n\nGalicia is a center of Druidry (Galician: \"Druidaria\") due to its strong Celtic heritage; the Pan-Galician Druidic Order (Galician: \"Irmandade Druídica Galaica\") is specific to Galicia. In the Basque Country, traditional Basque Gentility (Basque: \"Jentiltasuna\") and Sorginkery (Basque: \"Sorginkeria\"), Basque witchcraft, have been revived and have ties with Basque nationalism. \"Sorginkoba Elkartea\" is a Basque Neopagan organisation active in the Basque countries.\n\nTaoism has a presence in Spain, especially in Catalonia. Among Spanish people, it was introduced by the Chinese master Tian Chengyang in the 2000s, leading to the foundation of the Catalan Taoist Association (\"Asociación de Taoísmo de Cataluña\") and the opening of the Temple of Purity and Silence (\"Templo de la Pureza y el Silencio\") in Barcelona, both in 2001. The association has planned to expand the Temple of Purity and Silence as a traditional Chinese Taoist templar complex, the first Taoist temple of this kind in Europe.\n\nA further was opened in 2014 by the Chinese community of Barcelona, led by Taoist priest Liu Zemin, a 21st-generation descendant of poet, soldier and prophet Liu Bo Wen (1311-1375). The temple, located in the district of Sant Martí and inaugurated with the presence of the People's Republic of China consul Qu Chengwu, enshrines 28 deities of the province of China where most of the Chinese in Barcelona come from.\n\nA 2008 poll by the \"Obradoiro de Socioloxia\" yielded the following results:\nLarge studies carried out by the Center for Sociological Research (Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas) in September-October 2012 and September-October 2019 discovered information relating to the rates of religious self-identification across Spain's various autonomous communities. A study carried out by the same institution in October 2019 showed that the percentage of Catholics has decreased overall, from 72.9% to 68.3%, in a period of seven years.\n\nSpain, it has been observed, is a nation-state born out of religious struggle mainly between Catholicism and Islam, but also against Judaism (and, to a lesser extent, Protestantism). The Reconquista against Al Andalus (ending in 1492), the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition (1478) and the expulsion of Jews (1492) were highly relevant in the union of Castile and Aragon under the \"Catholic Monarchs\" Isabel and Fernando (1492), followed by the persecution and eventual expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609. The Counter-Reformation (1563–1648) was especially strong in Spain and the Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, thus keeping Islam, Judaism, Protestantism and parts of the Enlightenment at bay for most of its history.\n\nBefore Christianity, there were multiple beliefs in the Iberian Peninsula including local Iberian, Celtiberian and Celtic religions, as well as the Greco-Roman religion.\nAccording to a medieval legend, the apostle James was the first to spread Christianity in the Roman Iberian Peninsula. There is no factual evidence of this but he later became the patron saint of Spaniards and Portuguese, originating the Way of St James. According to Romans 15, Paul the Apostle also intended to visit Hispania; tradition has that he did and founded the , but there is no evidence of this either. Other later myths include the Seven Apostolic Men.\n\nThere is some archaeological evidence of Christianity slowly penetrating the Peninsula from Rome and Roman Mauretania via major cities and ports, especially Tarragona, since the early 2nd century. The , with 2,050 discovered tombs, dates back to the second half of the 3rd century. Saints like Eulalia of Mérida or Barcelona and are believed to have been martyred during the Decian or Diocletianic Persecutions (3rd–early 4th centuries). Bishops like , or the influential Hosius of Corduba were active in the same period.\n\nTheodosius I issued decrees that effectively made Nicene Christianity the official state church of the Roman Empire., This Christianity was already an early form of Catholicism.\n\nAs Rome declined, Germanic tribes invaded most of the lands of the former empire. In the years following 410 the Visigoths—who had converted to Arian Christianity around 360—occupied what is now Spain and Portugal. The Visigothic Kingdom established its capital in Toledo; it reached its high point during the reign of Leovigild (568-586). Visigothic rule led to a brief expansion of Arianism in Spain, however the native population remained staunchly Catholic. In 587 Reccared, the Visigothic king at Toledo, converted to Catholicism and launched a movement to unify doctrine. The Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. The multiple Councils of Toledo definitively established what would be later known as the Catholic Church in Spain and contributed to define Catholicism elsewhere.\n\nBy the early 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom had fragmented and the fragments were in disarray, bankrupt and willing to accept external help to fight each other. In 711 an Arab raiding party led by Tariq ibn-Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, then defeated the Visigothic king Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete. Tariq's commander, Musa bin Nusair, then landed with substantial reinforcements. Taking advantage of the Visigoths' infighting, by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula, establishing Islamic rule until 1492. \n\nDuring this period the number of Muslims increased greatly through the migration of Arabs and Berbers, and the conversion of local Christians to Islam (known as Muladis or Muwalladun) with the latter forming the majority of the Islamic-ruled area by the end of the 10th century. Most Christians who remained adopted Arabic culture, and these Arabized Christians became known as Mozarabs. While under the status of \"dhimmis\" the Christian and Jewish subjects had to pay higher taxes than Muslims and could not hold positions of power over Muslims.\n\nThe era of Muslim rule before 1055 is often considered a \"Golden Age\" for the Jews as Jewish intellectual and spiritual life flourished in Spain. Only in the northern fringes of the peninsula did Christians remain under Christian rule. Here they established the great pilgrimage centre of Santiago de Compostela.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Spain saw a slow Christian re-conquest of Muslim territories. In 1147, when the Almohads took control of Muslim Andalusian territories, they reversed the earlier tolerant attitude and treated Christians harshly. Faced with the choice of death, conversion, or emigration, many Jews and Christians emigrated. Christianity provided the cultural and religious cement that helped bind together those who rose up against the Moors and sought to drive them out. Christianity and the Catholic Church helped shape the re-establishment of European rule over Iberia.\n\nAfter centuries of the Reconquista, in which Christian Spaniards fought to drive out the Muslims, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile established the Spanish Inquisition in 1478, a religious purge of Muslim and Jewish thought and practice, from the Iberian Peninsula. Granada, the last Muslim redoubt, was eventually reconquered on January 2, 1492, 781 years after Tariq's first landing.\n\nIn the Early Modern Period, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spain carried Catholicism to the New World and to the Philippines, but the Spanish kings insisted on independence from papal \"interference\"—bishops in the Spanish domains were forbidden to report to the Pope except through the Spanish crown. In the 18th century, Spanish rulers drew further from the papacy, banishing the Jesuits from their empire in 1767. The Spanish authorities abolished the Inquisition in the 1830s, but even after that, religious freedom was denied in practice, if not in theory.\n\nCatholicism became the state religion in 1851, when the Spanish government signed a Concordat with the Holy See that committed Madrid to pay the salaries of the clergy and to subsidize other expenses of the Roman Catholic Church as a compensation for the seizure of church property in the \"Desamortización de Mendizábal\" of 1835-1837. This pact was renounced in 1931, when the secular constitution of the Second Spanish Republic imposed a series of anticlerical measures that threatened the Church's hegemony in Spain, provoking the Church's support for the Francisco Franco uprising five years later. In the ensuing Civil War, alleged communists and anarchists in Republican areas killed about 7,000 priests, the majority murdered between July and December 1936. Over four thousand were diocesan priests, as well as 13 bishops, and 2,365 male regulars or religious priests.\n\nOn 9 December 1931, the Spanish Constitution of 1931 established a secular state and freedom of religion in the Second Spanish Republic. It would remain in effect until 1 April 1939.\n\nThe advent of the Franco regime saw the restoration of the church's privileges under a totalitarian system known as \"National Catholicism\". During the Franco years, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and no other religion could own property or publish books. The Government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the Church, it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and civil marriages as well as banning abortion and the sale of contraceptives. Homosexuality and all other forms of sexual permissiveness were also banned. Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in public schools. Franco secured in return the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level.\n\nIn 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a new Concordat with the Vatican that granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges: mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; exemption from government taxation; subsidies for new building construction; censorship of materials the Church deemed offensive; the right to establish universities, to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; protection from police intrusion into church properties; and exemption of military service.\n\nThe proclamation of the Second Vatican Council in favor of religious freedom in 1965 provided more rights to other religious denominations in Spain. In the late 1960s, the Vatican attempted to reform the Church in Spain by appointing interim, or acting, bishops, thereby circumventing Franco's stranglehold on the country's clergy. Many young priests, under foreign influence, became worker priests and participated in anti-regime agitation. Many of them ended as leftist politicians, with some imprisoned in the Concordat prison reserved for priest prisoners. In 1966, the Franco regime passed a law that freed other religions from many of the earlier restrictions, but the law also reaffirmed the privileges of the Catholic Church. Any attempt to revise the 1953 Concordat met Franco's rigid resistance.\n\nIn 1976, however, King Juan Carlos de Borbon unilaterally renounced the right to name the bishops; later that year, Madrid and the Vatican signed a new accord that restored to the church its right to name bishops, and the Church agreed to a revised Concordat that entailed a gradual financial separation of church and state. Church property not used for religious purposes was henceforth to be subject to taxation, and over a period of years the Church's reliance on state subsidies was to be gradually reduced. The timetable for this reduction was not adhered to, however, and the church continued to receive the public subsidy through 1987 (US$110 million in that year alone).\n\nIt took the new 1978 Spanish Constitution to confirm the right of Spaniards to religious freedom and to begin the process of disestablishing Catholicism as the state religion. The drafters of the Constitution tried to deal with the intense controversy surrounding state support of the Church, but they were not entirely successful. The initial draft of the Constitution did not even mention the Church, which was included almost as an afterthought and only after intense pressure from the church's leadership. Article 16 disestablishes Roman Catholicism as the official religion and provides that religious liberty for non-Catholics is a state-protected legal right, thereby replacing the policy of limited toleration of non-Catholic religious practices. The article further states, however, that: \"The public authorities shall take the religious beliefs of Spanish society into account and shall maintain the consequent relations of cooperation with the Catholic Church and the other confessions.\" In addition, Article 27 also aroused controversy by appearing to pledge continuing government subsidies for private, Church-affiliated schools. These schools were sharply criticized by Spanish Socialists for having created and perpetuated a class-based, separate, and unequal school system. The Constitution, however, includes no affirmation that the majority of Spaniards are Catholics or that the state should take into account the teachings of Catholicism. The Constitution declares Spain a \"non-confessional\" state, however it is not a \"laïque\" (secular) state like France or Mexico.\n\nGovernment financial aid to the Catholic Church was a difficult and contentious issue. The Church argued that, in return for the subsidy, the state had received the social, health, and educational services of tens of thousands of priests and nuns who fulfilled vital functions that the state itself could not have performed at that time. Nevertheless, the revised Concordat was supposed to replace direct state aid to the church with a scheme that would allow taxpayers to designate a certain portion of their taxes to be diverted directly to the Church. Through 1985, taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to 10 percent from their taxable income for donations to the Catholic Church. Partly because of the protests against this arrangement from representatives of Spain's other religious groups and even from some Catholics, the tax laws were changed in 2007 so that taxpayers could choose between giving 0.52 percent of their income tax to the church and allocating it to the government's welfare and culture budgets. For three years, the government would continue to give the Church a gradually reduced subsidy, but after that the church would have to subsist on its own resources. The government would continue, however, its program of subsidizing Catholic schools, which in 1987 cost the Spanish taxpayers about US$300 million exclusive of the salaries of teachers, which were paid directly by the Ministry of Education and Science.\n\nIn a population of about 39 million at the beginning of Transition (begun in November 1975), the number of non-Catholics was probably no more than 300,000. About 290,000 of these were of other Christian faiths, including several Protestant denominations, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Mormons. The number of Jews in Spain was estimated at about 13,000 in the\nMurcia Jewish community. More than 19 out of every 20 Spaniards were baptized Catholics; about 60 percent of them attended Mass; about 30 percent of the baptized Catholics did so regularly, although this figure declined to about 20 percent in the larger cities. In 1979, about 97 percent of all marriages were performed according to the Catholic rite. A 1982 report by the church claimed that 82 percent of all children born the preceding year had been baptized in the church.\n\nNevertheless, there were forces at work bringing about fundamental changes in the place of the church in society. One such force was the improvement in the economic fortunes of the great majority of Spaniards, making society more materialistic and less religious. Another force was the massive shift in population from farm and village to the growing urban centers, where the church had less influence over the values of its members. These changes were transforming the way Spaniards defined their religious identity.\n\nBeing a Catholic in Spain had less and less to do with regular attendance at Mass and more to do with the routine observance of important rituals such as baptism, marriage, and burial of the dead. A 1980 survey revealed that, although 82 percent of Spaniards were believers in Catholicism, very few considered themselves to be very good practitioners of the faith. In the case of the youth of the country, even smaller percentages believed themselves to be \"very good\" or \"practicing\" Catholics.\n\nIn contrast to an earlier era, when rejection of the church went along with education, in the late 1980s studies showed that the more educated a person was, the more likely he or she was to be a practicing Catholic. This new acceptance of the church was due partly to the church's new self-restraint in politics. In a significant change from the pre-Civil War era, the church had accepted the need for the separation of religion and the state, and it had even discouraged the creation of a Christian Democratic party in the country.\n\nThe traditional links between the political right and the church no longer dictated political preferences; in the 1982 general election, more than half of the country's practicing Catholics voted for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. Although the Socialist leadership professed agnosticism, according to surveys between 40 and 45 percent of the party's rank-and-file members held religious beliefs, and more than 70 percent of these professed to be Catholics. Among those entering the party after Franco's death, about half considered themselves Catholic.\n\nOne important indicator of the changes taking place in the role of the church was the reduction in the number of Spaniards in Holy Orders. In 1984 the country had more than 22,000 parish priests, nearly 10,000 ordained monks, and nearly 75,000 nuns. These numbers concealed a troubling reality, however. More than 70 percent of the diocesan clergy was between the ages of 35 and 65; the average age of the clergy in 1982 was 49 years. At the upper end of the age range, the low numbers reflected the impact of the Civil War, in which more than 4,000 parish priests died. At the lower end, the scarcity of younger priests reflected the general crisis in vocations throughout the world, which began to be felt in the 1960s. Its effects were felt very acutely in Spain. The crisis was seen in the decline in the number of young men joining the priesthood and in the increase in the number of priests leaving Holy Orders. The number of seminarians in Spain fell from more than 9,000 in the 1950s to only 1,500 in 1979, even though it rose slightly in 1982 to about 1,700. In 2008, there were just 1,221 students in these theological schools.\n\nChanges in the social meaning of religious vocations were perhaps part of the problem; having a priest in the family no longer seemed to spark the kind of pride that family members would have felt in the past. The principal reason in most cases, though, was the church's continued ban on marriage for priests. Previously, the crisis was not particularly serious because of the age distribution of the clergy. As the twentieth century neared an end, however, a serious imbalance appeared between those entering the priesthood and those leaving it. The effects of this crisis were already visible in the decline in the number of parish priests in Spain—from 23,620 in 1979 to just over 22,000 by 1983 and 19,307 in 2005. New ordinations also dropped 19% from 241 in 1998 to 196 in 2008, with all-time record lows of 168 priests out of 45 million Spaniards taking their vows in 2007. The number of nuns shrank 6.9% to 54,160 in the period 2000-2005 as well. On the August 21, 2005, Evans David Gliwitzki became the first Catholic priest to get married in Spain.\n\nAnother sign of the church's declining role in Spanish life was the diminishing importance of the controversial secular religious institute Opus Dei (Work of God). Opus Dei, a worldwide lay religious body, did not adhere to any particular political philosophy. Its founder, Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer y Albas, stated that the organization was nonpolitical. The organization was founded in 1928 as a reaction to the increasing secularization of Spain's universities, and higher education continued to be one of the institute's foremost priorities. Despite its public commitment to a nonpolitical stance, Opus Dei members rose to occupy key positions in the Franco régime, especially in the field of economic policy-making in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Opus Dei members dominated the group of liberal technocrats who engineered the opening of Spain's autarchic economy after 1957. After the 1973 assassination of Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco (often rumored to be an Opus Dei member), however, the influence of the institute declined sharply. The secrecy of the order and its activities and the power of its myth helped it maintain its strong position of influence in Spain; but there was little doubt that, compared with the 1950s and the 1960s, Opus Dei had fallen from being one of the country's chief political organizations to being simply one among many such groups competing for power in an open and pluralist society.\n\nAn important number of Latin American immigrants, who are usually strong Catholic practitioners, have helped the Catholic Church to recover part of the attendance that regular Masses (Sunday Mass) used to have in the sixties and seventies and that was lost in the eighties among native Spaniards.\n\nSince 2003, the involvement of the Catholic Church in political affairs, through special groups such as Opus Dei, the Neocatechumenal Way or the Legion of Christ, especially personated through important politicians in the right-wing People's Party, has increased again. Old and new media, which are property of the Church, such as the COPE radio network or , have also contributed to this new involvement in politics by their own admission. The Church is no longer seen as a neutral and independent institution in political affairs and it is generally aligned with the opinion and politics of the People's Party. This implication has had, as a consequence, a renewed criticism from important sectors of the population (especially the majority of left-wing voters) against the Church and the way in which it is economically sustained by the State. While by 2017-2018 the Church was slowly backpedaling, the damage is potentially long-lasting among the younger generations who had not experienced it personally to such a degree.\n\nThe total number of parish priests shrank from 24,300 in 1975 to 18,500 in 2018 when the average age was 65.5 years. The number of nuns dropped by 44.5% to 32,270 between 2000 and 2016; most of them are old. By contrast, some expressions of popular religiosity still thrive, often linked to local festivals, and about 68.5% of the population self-defined themselves as Catholics in 2018, but just 39.8% of them (27.3% of the total population) attend Mass monthly or more often. Despite the arrival of large numbers of Catholic, Orthodox, Muslim and Protestant immigrants, irreligion continues to be the fastest growing demographic .\n\n"}

The album is named after a 1950s song, written by Donald and Doris Woods, which Zappa covers as part of \"The Man from Utopia Meets Mary Lou\".\n\n\"The Dangerous Kitchen\", \"Mōggio\" and \"The Jazz Discharge Party Hats\" were all prepared for Zappa's unreleased album \"Chalk Pie\". \n\nThe album was the second of two to credit Steve Vai with \"impossible guitar parts\", the first album being the preceding album \"Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch\" (1982).\n\nThe sleeve art features the work of Tanino Liberatore. It portrays Zappa on stage trying to kill mosquitoes. That is a reference to a concert held in Italy in 1982, the year before the release of the album, on 7 July at (which is also referred in a street sign on the album cover) in Segrate, near Milan. While Zappa was playing, a huge number of mosquitoes began flying on stage and gave the band a hard time. The back cover shows the audience as seen from the stage during the 1982 concert in Palermo, which ended in a riot.\n\nThe sleeve art is also a reference to Liberatore's comic character RanXerox.\n\nThe album's opening track \"Cocaine Decisions\", with its groove redolent of skiffle washboards, is an attack on drug-influenced businessmen and features a harmonica. \"The Dangerous Kitchen\" satirizes dirty, unkempt kitchens.\n\n\"The Dangerous Kitchen\", \"The Radio Is Broken\", and \"The Jazz Discharge Party Hats\" all feature Zappa's \"meltdown\" style of generally pre-written but sometimes improvised singing/speaking. For \"Jazz\" and \"Kitchen\", Zappa had guitarist Steve Vai overdub complex guitar parts for the entire length of the songs, which perfectly copied Zappa's every word and syllable. This unique type of overdub was a one-time experiment that Zappa never repeated. Hungarian composer Péter Eötvös said in an interview:\n\"\"Dangerous Kitchen\", off the album \"The Man From Utopia\", grew to become a basic piece for me, especially in later years, after I began working on operas. The technique that he uses in this particular song is very interesting: it's this half-sung, half-spoken performing method that's not quite like Sprechgesang, but what makes it so interesting is that he accompanies it with an instrumental solo. I was very surprised to find out that the guitar part was recorded separately. As it seemed so synchronous, I was convinced that Zappa had sung and played at the same time. Nevertheless the technique itself, the idea of \"the singing instrument\" comes from \"Dangerous Kitchen\".\"\n\nThe album was originally released on vinyl in 1983. An unauthorized CD of this edition (with the exception of a remixed \"Mōggio\") was issued by EMI in the UK in 1986. The album was issued (in remixed and resequenced form with one additional track) on CD in 1993 by Barking Pumpkin.

{"id": "2290792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290792", "title": "Island restoration", "text": "Island restoration\n\nThe ecological restoration of islands, or island restoration, is the application of the principles of ecological restoration to islands and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's endemic species, as well as important breeding grounds for seabirds and some marine mammals. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human disturbance and particularly to introduced species, due to their small size. Island groups such as New Zealand and Hawaii have undergone substantial extinctions and losses of habitat. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species. \n\nIsolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of Island biogeography, formulated by Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of New Zealand's bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.\n\nMany island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to predators. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of tameness. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that moas were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the dodo, are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the Pacific islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.\nThe field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahe, where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.\n\nOne important aspect of island restoration is the removal of invasive alien species. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased. A definitive list of past island restoration efforts exists as the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications. In addition a list of the current invasive species present on the world's islands exists as the Threatened Island Database \n\nIslands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors & Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of Round Island, in Mauritius, all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a Judas goat, where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.\n\nTrapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is poisoning, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the Falkland Islands, in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands and Rat Island (Hawadax) in the Aleutian archipelago. In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land crabs instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.\n\nThe removal of invasive weeds is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of sandbur, \"Cencrus echinatus\", an introduced grass on Laysan. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native bunchgrass, and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the Laysan duck and Laysan finch, as well as those of several seabirds. The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.\n\nThere are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication.\nExclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact.\nControl has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.\nEradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levels ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.\n\nFencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication.\nShooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly.\nTrapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at. This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture.\n\nPoisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.\n\nPathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use.\n\nPredator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems.\n\nCompetitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well.\nVirus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly.\n\nIn many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of endangered species, where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.\n\nOne other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival.\n\nPrior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the animal rights movement, which contends that the welfare of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and sterilization be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in Kangaroo Island koalas.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well. Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of hedgehog removal in the Outer Hebrides offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of \"Eucalyptus\" trees from Angel Island in San Francisco Bay faced considerable opposition.\n\nIsland restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects. A comprehensive list of projects can be found on the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications.\n\nRound Island (Île Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of Mauritius, with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres. Compared to other Mascarene islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810). These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a positive feedback mechanism that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts. \n\nSince removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, \"Latania loddigesii\", \"Pandanus vandermeerschii\" and \"Hyophorbe lagenicaulis\", which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were critically endangered) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks \"Leiolopisma telfaririi\" and \"Scelotes bojerii\", the geckos \"Phelsuma guentheri\", \"P. ornata\" and \"Nactus serpensinsula\", and the snake C\"asarea dussumerii.\"\n\nThe Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. \n\nThe Aleutian Islands, prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century Arctic foxes were introduced to act as a source for the fur trade, a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly seabirds like the whiskered auklet. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the ecology of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003.\n\nCampbell Island is a sub Antarctic island 700 km south of New Zealand that became infested with rats in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the Campbell teal and Campbell snipe, only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for ex-situ conservation, but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113 km, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of bird strike for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. Snipe have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.\n\nRats, brought to South Georgia Island as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century, have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks. While previously the island's glaciers formed a natural barrier to the spread of rats, these glaciers are now slowly melting as the climate warms. In 2011, scientists instituted a four-year programme to entirely eradicate the rats and mice, in what would be by far the largest rodent eradication attempt in the world to date. The project was led by zoologist Anthony Martin of The University of Dundee who stated, \"This is a man-induced problem and it's about time that man put right earlier errors.\" In July 2013, the success of the main phase of the extermination of the rats, which took place in May that year, was announced. 180 tonnes of rat poison, brodifacoum, were dropped over 70% of the island, in what was the world's largest ever operation of this kind. Another 95t of rat poison was planned to be dropped by three helicopters in January 2015. In June 2015 the eradication programme concluded, apparently successfully, with the island believed \"very likely\" to be rat free. Monitoring will continue for a further two or three years.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His command precipitated a notable cavalry raid in 1863, known as Streight's Raid. He was a prisoner of war for 10 months. On March 12, 1866, his nomination for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, to rank from March 13, 1865 was confirmed. He later became a politician, and served as a state senator in Indiana for two terms.\n\nAbel Streight was born in Wheeler, New York, son of Asa Streight and Lydia Spaulding Streight. On 14 Jan 1849 he married Lavina or Lovina McCarty, who was born 1830, Bath Twp., Steuben Co., NY and died 5 Jun 1910, Marion Co., IN. He moved to Cincinnati, as a young man, and by 1859 was living in Indianapolis, where he was a publisher of books and maps.\n\nStreight was appointed colonel of the 51st Indiana Infantry regiment on December 12, 1861. His regiment was soon attached to the Union Army of the Cumberland.\n\nStreight and his regiment saw very limited action during the first two years of their service, which is said to have disappointed him greatly.\n\nIn 1863, he proposed a plan to Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield (chief of staff of the Army of the Cumberland) that he be allowed to raise a force to make a raid deeply into the South. His proposal was to disrupt the Western & Atlantic Railroad from Chattanooga to Atlanta, which carried supplies to the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The Union Army's commander, William S. Rosecrans, gave him permission.\n\nUnion forces from Streight's own 51st Indiana, 73rd Indiana Infantry, 80th Illinois Infantry, and 3rd Ohio Infantry regiments were placed under Streight's command. This force encompassed approximately 1,700 troops. The original intent was to have this force mounted suitably for fast travel and attacks; however, due largely to wartime shortages, Streight's brigade were equipped with mules. This obvious disadvantage, combined with Streight's own inexperience, was to prove disastrous.\nStreight led this force to Nashville, departed Tuscumbia, Alabama, on April 26, 1863, and then to Eastport, Mississippi. From there he decided to push to the southeast, initially screened by another Union force commanded by Brig. Gen. Grenville Dodge. On April 30, Streight's brigade arrived at Sand Mountain, where he was intercepted by a Confederate cavalry force under Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and harassed for several days. Streight's force won the Battle of Day's Gap but the battle set off a series of skirmishes that eventually led the Union forces being surrounded and captured. Streight himself was captured at Cedar Bluff, Alabama on May 3, 1863, and taken to Libby Prison as a prisoner of war.\n\nLovina McCarthy Streight and the couple's five-year-old son accompanied the 51st into the South with Lovina acting as a nurse for the regiment. The soldiers dubbed her \"The Mother of the 51st\" for her contributions. Lovina was captured three times by Confederate soldiers. Twice she was exchanged in return for prisoners of war. The third time she escaped using a gun she had hidden under her skirts.\n\nOn February 9, 1864, after ten months of incarceration, Streight and 107 other soldiers escaped from Libby Prison by tunnelling from their barracks to freedom. Eventually, Streight was able to cross through enemy territory and, on his return, gave a debriefing report to his Union commanders.\n\nEventually Streight was restored to active duty being placed in command of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, IV Corps. He participated in the battles of Franklin and Nashville. Streight resigned from the army on March 16, 1865.\n\nOn January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Streight for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.\n\nIn 1866, Streight and his wife built a house on 4121 East Washington Street in Indianapolis. In 1876, Streight ran successfully for a seat in the Indiana Senate, serving a two-year term. In 1880, he ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate for governor of Indiana. In 1888, he was once again elected as State Senator. He died in Indianapolis four years later, in 1892, from complications of Bright's Disease. Although initially buried on the front lawn of his residence, his grave was eventually moved in 1902 to Crown Hill Cemetery. The grave includes a bronze bust of the general.\n\nStreight was the author of \"The Crisis of Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-one in the Government of the United States\", published in 1861.\n\nStreight's wife Lovina joined her husband on his southern campaign, often ministering help to wounded men during the battle. She was captured three times and exchanged for prisoners. When Abel died in 1892 she had him buried in the front yard of their home, stating, \"I never knew where he was in life, but now I can find him.\" Lovina Streight was known as the \"Mother of the 51st\", and upon her death in 1910, her funeral was afforded full military honors. It was said at the time that her funeral drew the largest crowd of mourners to Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis since the funeral of President Benjamin Harrison. In her will, she directed that the family mansion should become a home for aged women; however, relatives successfully challenged the will on the grounds that she was of “unsound mind.” The main arguments used by the plaintiffs were that she believed in spiritualism and was under the influence of B. Frank Schmid, a spiritualist.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2290811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290811", "title": "Oglebay Park", "text": "Oglebay Park\n\nOglebay Park is a self-supporting public municipal park, the only one of its kind, located on the outskirts of Wheeling, West Virginia on . In 1926, Earl W. Oglebay (of Oglebay, Norton, and Company) deeded his estate, Waddington Farms, to the city of Wheeling for the express purpose of public recreation. The park has been open to the public since 1928 when its governing body, the Wheeling Park Commission, began operations.\n\nSeveral Waddington Farms buildings, including the Mansion Museum and the greenhouse, remain in use today. Others, such as the Carriage House, have been rebuilt in the style of the original structures. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Oglebay Mansion is operated as a museum by the Oglebay Institute.\n\nThe park currently incorporates two championship golf courses, two standard courses (9-hole and 18-hole), one par three course, eleven tennis courts, a large outdoor pool, extensive walking trails, the Good Zoo, the Mansion Museum (operated by the Oglebay Institute), gardens, a greenhouse, the Anne Kuchinka Amphitheater, the Wilson Lodge (containing over 271 rooms), 54 cottages, The Schrader Center (a nature center operated by the Oglebay Institute), a planetarium (located within the Good Zoo), a ski slope, Camp Russel, and Schenk Lake, which is used for fishing, pedal boating, Segway tours, and several nightly fountain shows in season.\n\nAnnual events at the park include, but are not limited to: The Winter Festival of Lights, Oglebayfest, the Ohio County Fair, the West Virginia Open (tennis), Springfest, and Fort Henry Days (a living history weekend).\n\nThe Oglebay Mansion was built in 1846 by Paul Matvey as an eight-room farmhouse. Earl W. Oglebay, co-founder of the Oglebay-Norton Company, purchased the mansion and its adjoining areas in 1900, renamed it Waddington Farm, and used it as his summer estate and model farm. He was the ninth owner of the home and its adjoining land, and expanded the farmhouse into a mansion by adding additional wings and architectural features like the front portico. He gradually expanded the estate by purchasing adjacent farms until Waddington Farm had grown from to at the time of his death in 1926. The mansion became a museum in 1930. The museum, which includes restored rooms, local history exhibits, and exhibits on Earl W. Oglebay and his former estate, is operated by the Oglebay Institute and is open to the public for tours and programs throughout the year\n\nEarl W. Oglebay's hope was to develop Waddington Farm as a model farm, a laboratory for new agricultural changes that could be used to end the great starvation in the United States. He lent out parts of the farm to various researchers so that they could learn about crop rotation, soil improvement, and cost-cutting methods. Waddington Farm once incorporated a dairy farm, a poultry farm, a pig farm, and a sheep farm as well as stables, vineyards, a greenhouse, a rose garden, groves of fruit trees, vegetable gardens for the consumption of those living within the estate, and the areas used to research agricultural techniques. Oglebay's unconventional farming methods resulted in criticism by the agricultural community. To them, he was \"a man from the city trying outlandish things\", but after they saw the results of his experiments, they thought differently.\n\nThis 1985 holiday tradition began at Oglebay Park, but soon spread throughout the city of Wheeling. The first year, displays and landscape lighting covered over a three-mile (5 km) drive throughout the resort. The show now covers more than over a six-mile (10 km) drive throughout the park. Landscape lighting expert Dick Bosch and the late Robert J. Otten, Wheeling Park Commission's long-time creative director, were the creative talents behind Oglebay's party. Bosch's lighting expertise was needed to produce the lighting for trees and buildings, and Bob Otten designed the first five displays for the 1985 opening and created nearly 50 additional displays until his death in 2005.\n\nEvery year, several new displays are added. Notable displays from past years include the \"Snowflake Tunnel\", a display that allows visitors to drive through a lighted tunnel portraying thousands of twinkling snowflakes, the massive \"Polyhedron Star\", which includes over 2,000 lights, and the \"Poinsettia Wreath and Candle\", which is the festival's tallest. Other displays include the \"Candy Cane Wreath\", \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\", or \"Willard the Snowman\", named for the television personality Willard Scott, who switched on the lights for \"Light-Up Night\" in 1986. Every year, local students in Ohio County Schools submit new display ideas. Most displays are fabricated at Wheeling Park High School, where welding technology students build the frames for the displays. The school's electronics technology program has designed, built, and programmed the controls for every animated display at the Festival. The high school's radio station WPHP 91.9 also broadcasts seasonal music along with information about the resort and overall light show every evening from 5 - 11 pm.\n\nTwo of the park's light displays are synchronized to music. \"Gardens of Light\" and the Good Zoo's \"Lighting and Music Extravaganza\" were designed by Carson Williams, who created the original Wizards in Winter light display at his home in Mason, Ohio. The Good Zoo's light party, added in 2006, utilizes upwards of 35,500 LED bulbs and is controlled by a computer. This technology allows the lights to be synchronized with music. The \"Gardens of Light\" display, which was added in 2007, is very similar to the Good Zoo's light party, but on a much larger scale. In this display, park visitors walk through the gardens, which incorporate hanging flower baskets with lights and lighted flowers in the flowerbeds. The \"Gardens of Light\" display is an attempt to recreate the look of Oglebay Park's flower gardens during the spring and summer months.\n\nIn 2008, Oglebay announced that all new displays will use LED lights, rather than the incandescent lights that were used before. In addition, the park will gradually convert the existing displays to use LED lights. The new lights will use 85% less energy and last five times longer, according to Oglebay's website.\n\nThe Good Zoo is a facility that houses over 80 species of animals. The zoo was dedicated in memory of a seven-year-old boy, Philip Mayer Good, who loved nature. He was the son of Barbara and Larry Good of Wheeling. As of 2019, the Good Zoo's collection includes cheetahs, zebras, kangaroos, wallabys, tamarins, lemurs, ostriches, llamas, goats, barn owls, bald eagles, red pandas, gorals, peacocks, white-naped cranes, a small gang of meerkats and many other animals from all over the globe. There is a discovery lab, with an indoor South American rainforest exhibit, an aviary, which houses avian life including the rainbow lorikeet, the blue mountain (Swainson's) lorikeet, the green-naped lorikeet and more. The Good Zoo is the only AZA accredited zoo in West Virginia.\n\nThe Good Zoo is also home to a veterinary hospital where visitors can view operations and routine checkups. The hospital is used as a treatment area for zoo animals, a breeding center for certain species, a quarantine area for incoming animals, and a rehabilitation center for wild raptors. The zoo's raptor rehabilitation program has successfully treated many raptors and other native birds since its establishment. The zoo's turkey vultures, bald eagles are 2 of the animals on exhibit. \n\nThe Good Zoo has many SSP programs. The Species Survival Plan (SSP) is a cooperative breeding and conservation program instituted by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The goal of SSP programs is to help as many species as possible through captive breeding, education, research, and habitat preservation.\n\nAnnual events at the Good Zoo include \"Boo at the Zoo\" (in October), and \"The Good Zoo Lights Up For You\" (during the Festival of Lights), not to mention an annual car show at nearby Camp Russel, Easter egg hunt.\n\n\n"}

After McKenna joined Rhythm & Hues through Lanning, he later convinced her to co-found a video game development company with him.\n\nIn 1994, Lanning and McKenna co-founded Oddworld Inhabitants together in Los Osos, California, before later moving to San Luis Obispo, California. While at Oddworld Inhabitants, Lanning designed, scripted and voice acted all four of the studio's games, which earned the company widespread success and acclaim.\n\nFollowing several disputes with game developers, including companies such as Electronic Arts, Lanning and McKenna shuttered Oddworld Inhabitants' game development studio in 2005 and relocated to the San Francisco Bay area, with the goal of shaping Oddworld Inhabitants after a traditional Hollywood production company.\n\nAfter leaving game development, Lanning and McKenna began work on animated movies, starting with a project named \"Citizen Siege\", and a tie-in videogame series named \"Wage Wars\". Following difficulties in movie production, Lanning soon broke his hiatus from videogames when independent developer Just Add Water confirmed in 2010 it was working with Lanning and Oddworld Inhabitants to create a 2.5D remake of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee which eventually was released under the name .\n\nIn 2015, it was confirmed by JAW's CEO that the company will no longer be working on full-scale Oddworld projects.

The film stars Daniel H. Jenkins and Neill Barry as the title characters. Other members of the cast include Paul Dooley, Jane Curtin, Martin Mull, Dennis Hopper, Ray Walston, Louis Nye, Melvin Van Peebles, Tina Louise, Cynthia Nixon, Jon Cryer and Bob Uecker.\n\nThe film, a raunchy teen comedy described by the British Film Institute as \"probably Altman's least successful film\", was shot in 1983, but not released until long after post-production was completed (copyrighted in 1985). MGM shelved it for a couple of years, finally giving it a limited theatrical release in 1987 and 1988.\n\n\"O.C. & Stiggs\" is the adventure of two Arizona teenagers. In their car, the Gila Monster, they pick up sluts (loose women) and torture their nemesis, Randall Schwab, while procuring liquor from \"Wino Bob\" (a bum who lives in the oleander bushes behind the 7-Eleven).\n\n\n\nThe movie's plot was very loosely based on stories from \"National Lampoon\" magazine that were written by Ted Mann and Tod Carroll. O.C. and Stiggs were recurring characters in articles in the magazine, eventually leading up to the entire October 1982 issue being devoted to a fictional first-person account of the story of their summer, \"The Utterly Monstrous Mind-Roasting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs\". The plotline and main characters of the movie were significantly different from the \"National Lampoon\" stories they were based on. Most notably, the original magazine characters were destructive, malevolent teenagers, whereas the main characters of the movie were not inherently destructive, and significant portions of the magazine story were omitted from the movie.\n\nIn an interview years later, included on the DVD release of \"Tanner '88\", Altman acknowledges that the film didn't work but is quick to defend the cast, which included \"Tanner\" star Cynthia Nixon, saying it was \"not their fault.\"\n\nThe film received generally lackluster reviews.\n\nAlan Moore's comic characters D.R. and Quinch are a science fiction take on the magazine's O.C. and Stiggs characters.\n\n"}

To remain in business, The Little has created a unique theater experience for its patrons strikingly different from that of standard commercial cinemas. The Little typically shows films that never make it to the large theater chains, either due to lack of publicity, popularity, exposure, or content that is too risky and/or inappropriate for larger audiences (such as NC-17 rated films). Foreign films, independent films, some documentary films and art films are its common fare.\n\nThe Little is unique in the area in treating anime films as artistic cinema, and titles by the likes of Hayao Miyazaki always find their way to The Little's screens. Critics at The Little provide a synopsis of any film they intend to show, both on their website and posted around their ticket booths on the street.\n\nThe Little also offers live musical performances from local musicians, a rotating art gallery of local artists, and a cafe. Additionally, The Little serves as a performance venue during the Rochester International Jazz Festival each June. The Little is also the home of the Little Theatre Film Society, a group of theater aficionados in the Rochester area. The Little survives largely due to the hard work and dedication of the society's members. The theater is currently operated with the participation of the WXXI Public Broadcasting Council, a non-profit community organization which owns and operates the region's principal public radio and television stations.\n\nThe Little has become part of Rochester's extensive theater culture. Rochester has a rich history in cinema, being the home of the Eastman Kodak company and the George Eastman Museum. Kodak film was historically used in a majority of motion pictures (and still is today), creating close ties to the movie industry in Rochester society. The Little Theatre Film Society holds film festivals throughout the year, many of them hosted at The Little. The theatre is well known by any serious cinema patron in Rochester for providing an alternative to standard Hollywood commercial fare. The Little has also avoided the negative reputation for snobbishness that is sometimes associated with art house cinema, cultivating the image of a venue for anyone who is simply seeking an alternative or a community that celebrates cinema.\n\nThe word \"Theatre\" is often used instead of the word \"Theater\" to distinguish between art house cinemas and the more common variety. Theatre is an older form of the word, though both words share the same literal meaning. The Little uses the older form both to make this distinction and due to the age of the theater itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "2290843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290843", "title": "Interface Message Processor", "text": "Interface Message Processor\n\nThe Interface Message Processor (IMP) was the packet switching node used to interconnect participant networks to the ARPANET from the late 1960s to 1989. It was the first generation of gateways, which are known today as routers. An IMP was a ruggedized Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer with special-purpose interfaces and software. In later years the IMPs were made from the non-ruggedized Honeywell 316 which could handle two-thirds of the communication traffic at approximately one-half the cost. An IMP requires the connection to a host computer via a special bit-serial interface, defined in BBN Report 1822. The IMP software and the ARPA network communications protocol running on the IMPs was discussed in RFC 1, the first of a series of standardization documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n\nThe concept of an \"Interface computer\" was first developed in 1966 by Donald Davies for the NPL network in England. The same idea was independently developed in early 1967 at a meeting of principal investigators for the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to discuss interconnecting machines across the country. Larry Roberts, who led the ARPANET implementation, initially proposed a network of host computers. Wes Clark suggested inserting \"a small computer between each host computer and the network of transmission lines\", i.e. making the IMP a separate computer.\n\nThe IMPs were built by the Massachusetts-based company Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) in 1969. BBN was contracted to build four IMPs, the first being due at UCLA by Labor Day; the remaining three were to be delivered in one-month intervals thereafter, completing the entire network in a total of twelve months. When Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy learned of BBN's accomplishment in signing this million-dollar agreement, he sent a telegram congratulating the company for being contracted to build the \"Interfaith Message Processor\".\n\nThe team working on the IMP called themselves the \"IMP Guys\":\n\nBBN began programming work in February 1969 on modified Honeywell DDP-516s. The completed code was six thousand words long, and was written in the Honeywell 516 assembly language. The IMP software was produced primarily on a PDP-1, where the IMP code was written and edited, then run on the Honeywell.\n\nBBN designed the IMP simply as \"a messenger\" that would only \"store-and-forward\". BBN designed only the host-to-IMP specification, leaving host sites to build individual host-to-host interfaces. The IMP had an error-control mechanism that discarded packets with errors without acknowledging receipt; the source IMP, upon not receiving an acknowledging receipt, would subsequently re-send a duplicate packet. Based on the requirements of ARPA's request for proposal, the IMP used a 24-bit checksum for error correction. BBN chose to make the IMP hardware calculate the checksum, because it was a faster option than using a software calculation. The IMP was initially conceived as being connected to one host computer per site, but at the insistence of researchers and students from the host sites, each IMP was ultimately designed to connect to multiple host computers.\n\nThe first IMP was delivered to Leonard Kleinrock's group at UCLA on August 30, 1969. It used an SDS Sigma-7 host computer. Douglas Engelbart's group at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) received the second IMP on October 1, 1969. It was attached to an SDS-940 host. The third IMP was installed in University of California, Santa Barbara on November 1, 1969. The fourth and final IMP was installed in the University of Utah in December 1969. The first communication test between two systems (UCLA and SRI) took place on October 29, 1969, when a \"login\" to the SRI machine was attempted, but only the first two letters could be transmitted. The SRI machine crashed upon reception of the 'g' character. A few minutes later, the bug was fixed and the login attempt was successfully completed.\n\nBBN developed a program to test the performance of the communication circuits. According to a report filed by Heart, a preliminary test in late 1969 based on a 27-hour period of activity on the UCSB-SRI line found \"approximately one packet per 20,000 in error;\" subsequent tests \"uncovered a 100% variation in this number - apparently due to many unusually long periods of time (on the order of hours) with no detected errors.\"\n\nA variant of the IMP existed, called the TIP, which connected terminals as well as computers to the network; it was based on the Honeywell 316, a later version of the 516. Later, some Honeywell-based IMPs were replaced with multiprocessing BBN Pluribus IMPs, but ultimately BBN developed a microprogrammed clone of the Honeywell machine.\n\nIMPs were at the heart of the ARPANET until DARPA decommissioned the ARPANET in 1989. Most IMPs were either taken apart, junked or transferred to MILNET. Some became artifacts in museums; Kleinrock placed IMP Number One on public view at UCLA. The last IMP on the ARPANET was the one at the University of Maryland.\n\n\"BBN Report 1822\" specifies the method for connecting a host computer to an IMP. This connection and protocol is generally referred to as \"1822\", the report number.\n\nThe initial version of the 1822 protocol was developed in 1969: since it predates the OSI model by a decade, 1822 does not map cleanly into the OSI layers. However, it is accurate to say that the 1822 protocol incorporates the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer. The interface visible to the host system passes network layer addresses directly to a physical layer device.\n\nTo transmit data, the host constructs a message containing the numeric address of another host on the network (similar to an IP address on the Internet) and a data field, and transmits the message across the 1822 interface to the IMP. The IMP routes the message to the destination host using protocols that were eventually adopted by Internet routers. Messages could store a total length of 8159 Bits, of which the first 96 were reserved for the header (“leader”).\n\nWhile packets transmitted across the Internet are assumed to be unreliable, 1822 messages were guaranteed to be transmitted reliably to the addressed destination. If the message could not be delivered, the IMP sent to the originating host a message indicating that the delivery failed. In practice, however, there were (rare) conditions under which the host could miss a report of a message being lost, or under which the IMP could report a message as lost when it had in fact been received.\n\nLater versions of the 1822 protocol, such as 1822L, are described in RFC 802 and its successors.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2290846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2290846", "title": "Cambion", "text": "Cambion\n\nIn late European mythology and literature, a cambion is the offspring of an incubus, succubus, or other demon. In its earliest known uses, it was related to the word for change and was probably cognate with changeling. Since at least the 19th century, it has referred to the offspring of an incubus or succubus with a human.\n\nThe word \"cambion\" appeared on an early first century AD inscription in Gaul (Roman France). Linguist Benjamin W. Forston IV opines that:\nWilliam of Auvergne, in his 13th-century work \"De Universo\", wrote of \"\"cambiones\", from \"cambiti\", that is 'having been exchanged'\" - the \"sons of incubi demons\" substituted for human babies. These infants constantly wail for milk and cannot be satisfied even by four nurses. Richard Firth Green notes that this \"was to become the standard scholastic explanation for changelings throughout the Middle Ages.\"\n\nThe earliest evidenced appearance of the word \"cambion\" in the sense of an offspring of two demons is in the 1818 French-Language \"Dictionnaire Infernal\". The 1825 edition of that book has the following entry:\nEnglish translation:\nIn the \"Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology\" the cambion is again said to be the direct offspring of the incubus and the succubus, foregoing any need for human involvement. This same incarnation retained the absence of breath or a pulse until seven years of age, but was said to also have been incredibly heavy (even too heavy for a horse to carry) and to have cried upon being touched. \n\nSince at least the 19th century, \"cambion\" has taken on a further definition: the child of an incubus \"or\" a succubus with a human parent. In 1874, Victor Hugo's \"Toilers of the Sea\" defined a cambion as the son of a woman and the devil. It also appeared as a hybrid of human and demon in Dungeons and Dragon's 1983 \"Monster Manual II.\"\n\nThe concept of offspring born to humans and demons was a subject of debate in the Middle Ages. The influential \"Malleus Maleficarum\", which has been described as the major compendium of literature in demonology of the fifteenth century, states that demons, including the incubus and the succubus, are incapable of reproduction:\n\nBecause of this inability to create or nurture life, the method of the creation of a cambion is necessarily protracted. A succubus will have sex with a human male and so acquire a sample of his sperm. This she will then pass on to an incubus. The incubus will, in his turn, transfer the sperm to a human female and thus impregnate her.\n\nThe text goes on to discuss at great length the arguments for and against this process being possible, citing a number of Biblical quotations and noted scholars in support of its arguments, and finally concludes that this is indeed the method used by such demons. \n\nHowever, the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" never uses the word cambion, referring to the children of incubi as campsores or wechselkinder (the German term for changelings).\n\n\n"}
