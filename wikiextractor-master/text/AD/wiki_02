The train bombings occurred on the Circle line near and at Edgware Road, and on the Piccadilly line near .\n\nApart from the bombers, 52 UK residents of 18 different nationalities were killed and more than 700 were injured in the attacks, making it Britain's deadliest terrorist incident since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 near Lockerbie, Scotland, and England's deadliest since World War II, as well as the country's first Islamist suicide attack.\n\nThe explosions were caused by triacetone triperoxide IEDs packed into backpacks. The bombings were followed two weeks later by a series of attempted attacks that failed to cause injury or damage.\n\nAt 8:49 am, on Thursday 7 July 2005, three bombs were detonated on board London Underground trains within 50 seconds of each other:\n\n\nIt was originally thought that there had been six, rather than three, explosions on the Underground network. The bus bombing brought the reported total to seven; this was clarified later in the day. The erroneous reporting can be attributed to the fact that the blasts occurred on trains that were between stations, causing wounded passengers to emerge from both stations, giving the impression that there was an incident at each. Police also revised the timings of the tube blasts: initial reports had indicated that they occurred during a period of almost half an hour. This was due to initial confusion at London Underground (LU), where the explosions were originally believed to have been caused by power surges. An early report, made in the minutes after the explosions, involved a person under a train, while another described a derailment (both of which did occur, but only as a result of the explosions). A code amber alert was declared by LU at 09:19, and LU began to cease the network's operations, ordering trains to continue only to the next station and suspending all services.\nThe effects of the explosions varied due to the differing characteristics of the tunnels in which each occurred:\n\nAlmost one hour after the attacks on the London Underground, a fourth bomb was detonated on the top deck of a number 30 double-decker bus, a Dennis Trident 2 (fleet number 17758, registration LX03 BUF, two years in service at the time) operated by Stagecoach London and travelling its route from Marble Arch to Hackney Wick.\n\nEarlier, the bus had passed through the King's Cross area as it travelled from Hackney Wick to Marble Arch. At its final destination, the bus turned around and started the return route to Hackney Wick. It left Marble Arch at 9 am and arrived at Euston bus station at 9:35 am, where crowds of people had been evacuated from the tube and were boarding buses.\nThe explosion at 9:47 am in Tavistock Square ripped off the roof and destroyed the rear portion of the bus. The blast took place near BMA House, the headquarters of the British Medical Association, on Upper Woburn Place. A number of doctors and medical staff in or near that building were able to provide immediate emergency assistance.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing \"half a bus flying through the air\". BBC Radio 5 Live and \"The Sun\" later reported that two injured bus passengers said that they saw a man exploding in the bus.\n\nThe location of the bomb inside the bus meant the front of the vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers at the front of the top deck survived, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those at the rear of the bus suffered more serious injuries. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the death toll from the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.\n\nThe bombed bus was subsequently covered with tarpaulin and removed by low-loader for forensic examination at a secure Ministry of Defence site. The vehicle was ultimately returned to Stagecoach and scrapped thereafter on 15 October 2009. A replacement bus, a new Alexander Dennis Enviro400 (fleet number 18500, which has been changed since to 19000, registration LX55 HGC), was named \"Spirit of London\". In October 2012, the \"Spirit of London\" bus was set alight in an arson attack. It was repaired and refurbished at a cost of £60,000 and re-entered service in April 2013. Two 14-year-old girls were charged for the attack.\n\nThe 52 victims were of diverse backgrounds; among them were several foreign-born British nationals and foreign exchange students. The majority of the victims lived in or near London. Because of train delays before the attacks and subsequent transport problems caused by them, several victims died aboard trains and buses they would not normally have taken. Their ages ranged from 20 to 60 years old, with an average age of 34.\n\nAll of the victims were UK residents; 32 of them were British. One victim each came from Afghanistan, France, Ghana, Grenada, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mauritius, New Zealand, Nigeria, Romania, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. Three victims were Polish nationals, while one victim was a Vietnamese born Australian and one held dual American-Vietnamese citizenship.\n\nSeven of the victims were killed at Aldgate, six at Edgware Road, 26 at King's Cross and 13 at Tavistock Square.\n\nThe four suicide bombers were later identified as:\n\nThree of the bombers were British-born sons of Pakistani immigrants; Lindsay was a convert born in Jamaica.\n\nCharles Clarke, Home Secretary when the attacks occurred, described the bombers as \"cleanskins\", a term describing them as previously unknown to authorities until they carried out their attacks. On the day of the attacks, all four had travelled to Luton, Bedfordshire, by car, then to London by train. They were recorded on CCTV arriving at King's Cross station at about 08:30 am.\n\nTwo of the bombers made videotapes describing their reasons for becoming what they called \"soldiers\". In a videotape broadcast by Al Jazeera on 1 September 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan, described his motivation. The tape had been edited and mentioned al-Qaeda members Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, describing them as \"today's heroes\". Khan's tape said:\nThe tape continued:\nOn 6 July 2006, a videotaped statement by Shehzad Tanweer was broadcast by Al-Jazeera. In the video, which may have been edited to include remarks by al-Zawahiri, Tanweer said:\nTanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which \"continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya.\"\n\nInitial reports suggested that a power surge on the Underground power grid had caused explosions in power circuits. This was later ruled out by power suppliers National Grid. Commentators suggested that the explanation had been made because of bomb damage to power lines along the tracks; the rapid series of power failures caused by the explosions (or power being ended by means of switches at the locations to permit evacuation) looked similar, from the point of view of a control room operator, to a cascading series of circuit breaker operations that would result from a major power surge. A couple of hours after the bombings, Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed the incidents were terrorist attacks.\n\nAlthough there were security alerts at many locations throughout the United Kingdom, no terrorist incidents occurred outside central London. Suspicious packages were destroyed in controlled explosions in Edinburgh, Brighton, Coventry, Southampton, Portsmouth, Darlington and Nottingham. Security across the country was increased to the highest alert level.\n\n\"The Times\" reported on 17 July 2005 that police sniper units were following as many as a dozen al-Qaeda suspects in Britain. The covert armed teams were ordered to shoot to kill if surveillance suggested that a terror suspect was carrying a bomb and he refused to surrender if challenged. A member of the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Firearms Command said: \"These units are trained to deal with any eventuality. Since the London bombs they have been deployed to look at certain people.\"\n\nVodafone reported that its mobile telephone network reached capacity at about 10 am on the day of the bombings, and it was forced to initiate emergency procedures to prioritise emergency calls (ACCOLC, the 'access overload control'). Other mobile phone networks also reported failures, causing for example BBC Radio London reporters to use landline phones and Sky News to use the station ticker for displaying messages from persons trying to contact their relatives. The BBC speculated that the telephone system was shut down by security services to prevent the possibility of mobile phones being used to trigger bombs. Although this option was considered, it became clear later that the intermittent unavailability of both mobile and landline telephone systems was due only to excessive usage. ACCOLC was activated only in a radius around Aldgate Tube Station because key emergency personnel did not have ACCOLC-enabled mobile phones. The communications failures during the emergency sparked discussions to improve London's emergency communications system.\nFor most of the day, central London's public transport system was largely out of service following the complete closure of the Underground, the closure of the Zone 1 bus network, and the evacuation of incident sites such as Russell Square. Bus services restarted at 4 pm on 7 July, and most mainline railway stations resumed service soon afterward. River vessels were pressed into service to provide a free alternative to overcrowded trains and buses. Local lifeboats were required to act as safety boats, including the Sheerness lifeboat from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. Thousands of people chose to walk home or to the nearest Zone 2 bus or railway station. Most of the Underground, apart from the stations affected by the bombs, resumed service the next morning, though some commuters chose to stay at home. Affected stretches were also closed for police investigations.\n\nMuch of the King's Cross railway station was also closed, with the ticket hall and waiting area being used as a makeshift hospital to treat casualties. Although the station reopened later during the day, only suburban rail services were able to use it, with Great North Eastern Railway trains terminating at Peterborough (the service was fully restored on 9 July). King's Cross St Pancras tube station remained available only to Metropolitan line services to facilitate the ongoing recovery and investigation for a week, though Victoria line services were restored on 15 July and the Northern line on 18 July. All of the damaged trains were removed in stages. St. Pancras station, located next to King's Cross, was shut on the afternoon of the attacks, with all Midland Mainline trains terminating at Leicester, causing disruption to services to Sheffield, Nottingham and Derby.\nOn 25 July, the Hammersmith & City line was reopened from Baker Street to Barking after the affected train was cleared at Aldgate, together with the stretch from Moorgate to Aldgate of the Metropolitan Line. The Hammersmith to Paddington part of the Hammersmith & City line was a shuttle service after the bombings. On 29 July, the District line was reopened from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road, after the affected train was cleared.\n\nOn 2 August the Hammersmith & City line resumed normal service; the Circle line was still suspended, though all Circle line stations are also served by other lines. The Piccadilly line service resumed on 4 August after the affected train was cleared on 16 July, and enhanced maintenance work was done. On 4 August, the Circle line was reopened again.\n\nThere were limited reactions to the attack in the world economy as measured by financial market and exchange rate activity. The value of the British pound decreased 0.89 cents to a 19-month low against the US dollar. The FTSE 100 Index fell by about 200 points during the two hours after the first attack. This was its greatest decrease since the invasion of Iraq, and it triggered the London Stock Exchange's 'Special Measures', restricting panic selling and aimed at ensuring market stability. By the time the market closed it had recovered to only 71.3 points (1.36%) down on the previous day's three-year closing high. Markets in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain also closed about 1% down on the day.\n\nUS market indexes increased slightly, partly because the dollar index increased sharply against the pound and the euro. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 31.61 to 10,302.29. The NASDAQ Composite Index increased 7.01 to 2075.66. The S&P 500 increased 2.93 points to 1197.87 after decreasing as much as 1%. Every benchmark value gained 0.3%.\n\nThe market values increased again on 8 July as it became clear that the damage caused by the bombings was not as great as thought initially. By end of trading the market had recovered fully to above its level at start of trading on 7 July. Insurers in the UK tend to reinsure their terrorist liabilities in excess of the first £75,000,000 with Pool Re, a mutual insurer established by the government with major insurers. Pool Re has substantial reserves and newspaper reports indicated that claims would easily be funded.\n\nOn 9 July, the Bank of England, HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority revealed that they had instigated contingency plans immediately after the attacks to ensure that the UK financial markets could keep trading. This involved the activation of a \"secret chatroom\" on the British government's Financial Sector Continuity website, which allowed the institutions to communicate with the country's banks and market dealers.\n\nContinuous news coverage of the attacks was broadcast throughout 7 July, by both BBC One and ITV1, uninterrupted until 7 p.m. Sky News did not broadcast any advertisements for 24 hours. ITN confirmed later that its coverage on ITV1 was its longest uninterrupted on-air broadcast of its 50-year history. Television coverage was notable for the use of mobile telephone footage sent in by members of the public and live pictures from traffic CCTV cameras.\n\nThe BBC Online website recorded an all-time bandwidth peak of 11 Gb/s at midday on 7 July. BBC News received some 1 billion total accesses throughout the course of the day (including all images, text and HTML), serving some 5.5 terabytes of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000-page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the 2012 Summer Olympics being awarded to London resulted in up to 5 Gb/s. The previous all time maximum for the website followed the announcement of the Michael Jackson verdict, which used 7.2 Gb/s.\n\nOn 12 July it was reported that the British National Party released leaflets showing images of the 'No. 30 bus' after it was destroyed. The slogan, \"Maybe now it's time to start listening to the BNP\" was printed beside the photo. Home Secretary Charles Clarke described it as an attempt by the BNP to \"cynically exploit the current tragic events in London to further their spread of hatred\".\n\nSome media outside the UK complained that successive British governments had been unduly tolerant towards radical Islamist militants, so long as they were involved in activities outside the UK. Britain's alleged reluctance to extradite or prosecute terrorist suspects resulted in London being dubbed \"Londonistan\" by the columnist Melanie Phillips.\n\nEven before the identity of the bombers became known, former Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Stevens said he believed they were almost certainly born or based in Britain, and would not \"fit the caricature al-Qaeda fanatic from some backward village in Algeria or Afghanistan\". The attacks would have required extensive preparation and prior reconnaissance efforts, and a familiarity with bomb-making and the London transport network as well as access to significant amounts of bomb-making equipment and chemicals.\n\nSome newspaper editorials in Iran blamed the bombing on British or American authorities seeking to further justify the War on Terror, and claimed that the plan that included the bombings also involved increasing harassment of Muslims in Europe.\n\nOn 13 August 2005, quoting police and MI5 sources, \"The Independent\" reported that the bombers acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind some place abroad.\n\nOn 1 September it was reported that al-Qaeda officially claimed responsibility for the attacks in a videotape broadcast by the Arab television network Al Jazeera. However, an official inquiry by the British government reported that the tape claiming responsibility had been edited after the attacks, and that the bombers did not have direct assistance from al-Qaeda. Zabi uk-Taifi, an al-Qaeda commander arrested in Pakistan in January 2009, may have had connections to the bombings, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. More recently, documents found by German authorities on a terrorist suspect arrested in Berlin in May 2011 have suggested that Rashid Rauf, a British al Qaeda operative, played a key role in planning the attacks.\n\nA second claim of responsibility was posted on the Internet by another al-Qaeda-linked group, Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades. The group had, however, previously falsely claimed responsibility for events that were the result of technical problems, such as the 2003 London blackout and the US Northeast blackout of 2003.\n\nA survey of 500 British Muslims undertaken by Channel 4 News in 2007 found that 24% believed the four bombers blamed for the attacks did not perform them.\n\nThere have been various conspiracy theories proposed about the bombings, including the suggestion that the bombers were 'patsies', based on claims about timings of the trains and the train from Luton, supposed explosions underneath the carriages, and allegations of the faking of the one time-stamped and dated photograph of the bombers at Luton station. Claims made by one theorist in the Internet video \"7/7 Ripple Effect\" were examined by the BBC documentary series \"The Conspiracy Files\", in an episode titled \"7/7\" first broadcast on 30 June 2009, which debunked many of the video's claims.\n\nOn the day of the bombings Peter Power of Visor Consultants gave interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live and ITV saying that he was working on a crisis management simulation drill, in the City of London, \"based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning\", when he heard that an attack was going on in real life. He described this as a coincidence. He also gave an interview to the \"Manchester Evening News\" where he spoke of \"an exercise involving mock broadcasts when it happened for real\". After a few days he dismissed it as a \"spooky coincidence\" on Canadian TV.\n\nInitially, there was much confused information from police sources as to the origin, method, and even timings of the explosions. Forensic examiners had thought initially that military-grade plastic explosives were used, and, as the blasts were thought to have been simultaneous, that synchronised timed detonators were employed. This hypothesis changed as more information became available. Home-made organic peroxide-based devices were used, according to a May 2006 report from the British government's Intelligence and Security Committee. The explosive was triacetone triperoxide.\n\n56 people, including the four suicide bombers, were killed by the attacks and about 700 were injured, of whom about 100 were hospitalised for at least one night. The incident was the deadliest single act of terrorism in the United Kingdom since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed on Lockerbie and killed 270 people, and the deadliest bombing in London since the Second World War.\n\nPolice examined about 2,500 items of CCTV footage and forensic evidence from the scenes of the attacks. The bombs were probably placed on the floors of the trains and bus. Investigators identified four men whom they alleged had been the suicide bombers. This made the bombings the first ever suicide attack in the British Isles.\n\nVincent Cannistraro, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency's anti-terrorism centre, told \"The Guardian\" that \"two unexploded bombs\" were recovered as well as \"mechanical timing devices\"; this claim was explicitly rejected by London's Metropolitan Police Service.\n\nWest Yorkshire Police raided six properties in the Leeds area on 12 July: two houses in Beeston, two in Thornhill, one in Holbeck and one in Alexandra Grove in Hyde Park, Leeds. One man was arrested. Officers also raided a residential property on Northern Road in the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury on 13 July.\n\nThe police service say a significant amount of explosive material was found in the Leeds raids and a controlled explosion was carried out at one of the properties. Explosives were also found in the vehicle associated with one of the bombers, Shehzad Tanweer, at Luton railway station and subjected to controlled explosion.\n\nThere was speculation about a possible association between the bombers and another alleged Islamist cell in Luton which was ended during August 2004. The Luton group was uncovered after Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan. His laptop computer was said to contain plans for tube attacks in London, as well as attacks on financial buildings in New York City and Washington, D.C. The group was subject to surveillance but on 2 August 2004 \"The New York Times\" published Khan's name, citing Pakistani sources. The news leak forced police in Britain and Canada to make arrests before their investigations were complete. The US government later said they had given the name to some journalists as \"background information\", for which Tom Ridge, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, apologised.\n\nWhen the Luton cell was ended, one of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan (no known relation), was scrutinised briefly by MI5 who determined that he was not a likely threat and he was not surveilled.\n\nOn 22 March 2007, three men were arrested in connection with the bombings. Two were arrested at 1 pm at Manchester Airport, attempting to board a flight bound for Pakistan that afternoon. They were apprehended by undercover officers who had been following the men as part of a surveillance operation. They had not intended to arrest the men that day, but believed they could not risk letting the suspects leave the country. A third man was arrested in the Beeston area of Leeds at an address on the street where one of the suicide bombers had lived before the attacks.\n\nOn 9 May 2007 police made four further arrests, three in Yorkshire and one in Selly Oak, Birmingham. The widow of the presumed ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan, was among those arrested for \"commissioning, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism\".\n\nThree of those arrested, including Khan's widow, were released on 15 May. The fourth, Khalid Khaliq, an unemployed single father of three, was charged on 17 July 2007 with possessing an al-Qaeda training manual, but the charge was not related to the 2005 London attacks. Conviction for possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism carried a maximum ten-year jail sentence.\n\nAbdullah el-Faisal was deported to Jamaica, his country of origin, from Britain on 25 May 2006 after reaching the parole date in his prison sentence. He was found guilty of three charges of soliciting the murder of Jews, Americans and Hindus and two charges of using threatening words to incite racial hatred in 2003 and, despite an appeal, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. In 2006 John Reid alleged to MPs that el-Faisal had influenced Jamaican-born Briton Germaine Lindsay into participating in the 7/7 bombings.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported on 3 May 2007 that police had investigated Mohammad Sidique Khan twice during 2005. The newspaper said it \"learned that on 27 January 2005, police took a statement from the manager of a garage in Leeds which had loaned Khan a courtesy car while his vehicle was being repaired.\" It also said that \"on the afternoon of 3 February an officer from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism branch carried out inquiries with the company which had insured a car in which Khan was seen driving almost a year earlier\". Nothing about these inquiries appeared in the report by Parliament's intelligence and security committee after it investigated the 7 July attacks. Scotland Yard described the 2005 inquiries as \"routine\", while security sources said they were related to the fertiliser bomb plot.\n\nWhile no warnings before 7 July bombings have been documented officially or acknowledged, the following are sometimes quoted as indications either of the events to come or of some foreknowledge.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki had inspired the bombers. The bombers transcribed lectures of al-Awlaki while plotting the bombings. His materials were found in the possession of accused accomplices of the suicide bombers. Al-Awlaki was killed by a US drone attack in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, the government refused to hold a public inquiry, stating that \"it would be a ludicrous diversion\". Prime Minister Tony Blair said an independent inquiry would \"undermine support\" for MI5, while the leader of the opposition, David Cameron, said only a full inquiry would \"get to the truth\". In reaction to revelations about the extent of security service investigations into the bombers prior to the attack, the Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, said: \"It is becoming more and more clear that the story presented to the public and Parliament is at odds with the facts.\" \n\nThe decision to not hold an independent public inquest was later reversed and in October 2010 an independent coroner's inquest of the bombings began. Lady Justice Hallett was appointed to hear the inquest, which would consider how each victim died and whether MI5, if it had worked better, could have prevented the attack, and also the emergency service response.\n\nAfter seven months of evidence and deliberation, the verdict of the inquiry was released and read in the Houses of Parliament on 9 May 2011. It determined that the 52 victims had been unlawfully killed; their deaths could not have been prevented, and they would probably have died \"whatever time the emergency services reached and rescued them\". Hallett concluded that MI5 had not made every possible improvement since the attacks but that it was not \"right or fair\" to say more attention should have been paid to ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan prior to 7 July. She also decided that there should be no public inquiry.\n\nThe report provided nine recommendations to various bodies:\n\nIt was reported in July 2011 that relatives of some of the victims of the bombings may have had their telephones accessed by the \"News of the World\" in the aftermath of the attacks. The revelations added to an existing controversy over phone hacking by the tabloid newspaper.\n\nThe fathers of two victims, one in the Edgware Road blast and another at Russell Square, told the BBC that police officers investigating the alleged hacking had warned them that their contact details were found on a target list, while a former firefighter who helped injured passengers escape from Edgware Road also said he had been contacted by police who were looking into the hacking allegations. A number of survivors from the bombed trains also revealed that police had warned them their phones may have been accessed and their messages intercepted, and in some cases officers advised them to change security codes and PINs.\n\nSince the bombings, the United Kingdom and other nations have honoured the victims in several ways. Most of these memorials have included moments of silence, candlelit vigils, and the laying of flowers at the attack sites. Foreign leaders have also remembered the dead by ordering their flags to be flown at half-mast, signing books of condolences at embassies of the UK, and issuing messages of support and condolences to the British people.\n\nThe government ordered the Union Flag to be flown at half-mast on 8 July. The following day, the Bishop of London led prayers for the victims during a service paying tribute to the role of women during the Second World War. A vigil, called by the Stop the War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Muslim Association of Britain, was held from 5 pm, at Friends Meeting House on Euston Road.\n\nA two-minute silence was held on 14 July 2005 throughout Europe. Thousands attended a vigil at 6 pm on Trafalgar Square. After an initial silence there was a series of speakers for two hours. A memorial service was held at St Paul's Cathedral on 1 November 2005. To mark the first anniversary of the attack, a two-minute silence was observed at midday across the country.\n\nA permanent memorial was unveiled in 2009 by Prince Charles in Hyde Park to mark the fourth anniversary of the bombings. On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the attacks in 2014 the memorial was defaced with messages including \"Blair lied, thousands died\". The graffiti was removed within hours.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London a minute's silence was held to commemorate those killed in the attacks.\n\nA memorial service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral on 7 July 2015, to mark the 10th anniversary of the bombings. This was broadcast on BBC One.\n\nUS President George W. Bush visited the British embassy the day after the bombings, upon his return from the G8 summit in Scotland, and signed a book of condolence. In Washington, D.C., the US Army band played \"God Save the Queen\" (the British national anthem, the melody of which is also used in an American patriotic hymn, \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\"), a suggestion that US Army veteran John Miska made to Vice Chief of Staff General Cody, outside the British embassy in the city. A similar tribute had been made by the Queen in the days following the September 11 attacks in 2001 where the Star Spangled Banner played at Buckingham Palace's Changing the Guard. On 12 July, a Detroit Symphony Orchestra brass ensemble played the British national anthem during the pre-game festivities of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit.\n\nFlags were ordered to fly at half-mast across Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The Union Flag was raised to half-mast alongside the Flag of Australia on Sydney Harbour Bridge as a show of \"sympathy between nations\".\n\nMoments of silence were observed in the European Parliament, the Polish parliament and by the Irish parliament on 14 July. The British national anthem was played at the changing of the royal guard at Plaza de Oriente in Madrid in memorial to the victims of the attacks. The ceremony was attended by the British ambassador to Spain and members of the Spanish Royal Family. After the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the UK had hosted a similar ceremony at Buckingham Palace.\n\nMohammed Rehman and Sana Ahmed Khan were sentenced to life imprisonment on 29 December 2015 for preparing an act of terrorism, planning to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the 7/7 attacks. They had 10 kg of urea nitrate. Rehman called himself the 'silent bomber' and asked his Twitter followers to choose between the Westfield Shopping Centre or the London Underground for the planned suicide bomb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The village is situated about east of Uppingham, south of the A47 road which passes through the parish. In 2001, it had a population of 219, falling to 204 at the 2011 census.\n\nBisbrooke was first recorded in the \"Domesday Book\" of 1086 then spelt \"Bitlesbroch\". Over the centuries the spelling has gone through as many as 19 name changes including Bitelesbroke, Pysbroke and Butlisbroke before the present spelling was adopted. At the time of the Norman survey, about half of the land was owned by the King and the rest by Countess Judith of Fotheringhay in Northamptonshire. Following the dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century, in 1547 the land was granted by King Edward VI to Sir Richard Lee who soon afterwards settled it on Anthony Andrews. The land was still in the Andrews family nearly a century later with Bisbrooke or Pisbroke as it was then spelled, being owned by Anthony’s great, grandson Edward, Sheriff of Rutland. In the Civil War Edward initially supported the King but afterwards embraced the Parliamentarians’ cause. Fined for his earlier Royalist tendencies, he seemed to have been unable to meet his debts and his land was sold. The Bisbrooke estate was acquired during the Commonwealth by Sir George Manners (father of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland) and so, most of Bisbrooke passed into the Duke of Rutland's Belvoir Estate. It was auctioned in 1918.\n\nThe parish church of St John the Baptist dates from 1871 in its present form, though the tower was only finished in 1914. It was listed Grade II in 1955. There are a number of fine gravestones, which pre-date the present building. Samuel Thomas Bloomfield was vicar here from 1814 until his death in 1869 and chess player George Alcock MacDonnell was vicar, 1887-99.\nBisbrooke Hall is to the north of the A47 within the parish boundary but actually nearer to the village of Glaston. The Hall was substantially remodelled and extended by Lord Carbery around 1840.\n\nThe village pub, the Gate was run by Ruby D'Arcy from 1968 to 2012 and many a schoolboy from Uppingham School (Stephen Fry, Rick Stein, Jonathan Agnew, David Whitaker and Johnny Vaughan among them) supposedly slipped across the fields from Uppingham to relax, away from their masters’ watchful gaze. Ruby's husband Peter D'Arcy was spoken of with affection and when he died, 1,500 mourners attended his funeral in Bisbrooke church. The pub did not re-open after Ruby D'Arcy's death and has been converted as a private house.\n\nIn the 1950s, \"small-holdings, orchards and vegetable patches jostle each other in the sheltered hollows of Bisbrooke” where “almost everyone grows and sells strawberries”; much of the fruit was sent for jam-making.\n\nThe village was too unremarkable to warrant an entry in Arthur Mee's \"The King's England\" volume.\n\n"}

The Tyrolean Salt Road from Hall in Tirol to Lake Constance crossed the entire district of Außerfern.\n\nReutte was declared a market town by Sigmund in 1489. This was confirmed later by Maximilian I who also added some further rights. The people of Reutte commemorate this with an annual festival on the first Saturday in August.\n\nFrom 1692 the painter Paul Zeiller had a workshop in Reutte that later became an art school. His son Johann Jakob Zeiller and cousin Franz Anton Zeiller both received their first lessons there.\n\nDuring the period when Austria belonged to Germany (1938 – 1945) there was an outpost of Dachau concentration camp near Reutte, called “Plansee Breitenwald”. In April 1945, American troops of the 44th Infantry Division reached Reutte. The American soldiers had been told to expect heavy attacks but in fact there was no special resistance by Axis forces at all. Reutte was the place where German engineers from Peenemünde surrendered to the United States Army on 3 May 1945, among them Wernher von Braun; all of them were later sent to Fort Bliss in the United States in order to work on the manufacturing of ballistic missiles and rockets, the most famous of which was the Saturn V in the sixties.\n\nAs Reutte is connected with other major parts of the Tyrol only by the Fern Pass, international transport and economic connections to the EU, especially to Germany, are becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe coat of arms of Reutte shows three fir trees on three hills, representing the abundance of available timber in the region. (The name \"Reutte\" has its origin in \"roden\" or \"reuten\" meaning glade). The background of red and white stripes stands for the state and the republic.\n\nReutte is linked to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Kempten, Allgäu by train services operated by Deutsche Bahn. Reutte is a popular holiday resort and its proximity to the famous Bavarian Castles and the Ehrenberg ruins make Reutte a cultural destination as well as a skiing destination.\n\n"}

HM Prison Ashwell a Category C men's prison in the parish of Burley, closed in 2011. \n\nIn the parish, north of the village, is Alstoe, the site of a possible small motte-and-bailey castle, and part of the deserted medieval village of Alsthorpe. Alstoe was the name of a hundred.\n\nIn 1379 Sir Thomas le Despenser granted the Burley manor to trustees, two of whom were his brother Henry, Bishop of Norwich and his nephew Hugh le Despenser. Thomas died without issue in 1381, when at the outbreak of the Peasants' Revolt, Henry was at Burley and travelled to Norwich to confront the rebels.\n\nThe Old Smithy on the village green was used in advertisements for \"Cherry Blossom\" shoe polish in the 1920s.\n\nAshwell Prison, was located about one mile (2 km) west of the centre of the village. Previously the site was a World War II US army base, home to part of the 82nd Airborne Division. The prison closed in March 2011 and has been redeveloped as Oakham Enterprise Park, a business park for office and light industrial use.\n\nThe mansion in the village overlooks Rutland Water. The first house was owned by Sir John Harington of Exton. On New Year's day 1596 he produced a performance of \"Titus Andronicus\" and a masque written by his brother-in-law Sir Edward Wingfield at Burley. Harington's daughter Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford sold Burley to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1620 for £28,000. Buckingham produced Ben Jonson's masque \"The Gypsies Metamorphosed\" at Burley in 1621 to celebrate his marriage to Katherine Manners. Later in 1621 Buckingham requested Scottish fir tree seeds and saplings for the park from the Earl of Mar, and 1624 the Earl of Northumberland sent 1,000 walnut trees.\n\nThe house in the manner associated with Sir Christopher Wren, was built in the 1690s by the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who was to a large extent his own architect and involved himself in the minutiae of construction, but employed Henry Dormer (died 1727) to supervise its building. Nottingham replaced Dormer with John Lumley in 1697. Before embarking on the project, Lord Nottingham consulted Sir Christopher Wren and had measurements taken at Berkeley House and Montagu House in London. The house, in an H-plan, has a pedimented central block and lightly projecting end pavilions. With its symmetrical wings and outbuildings forming a cour d'honneur, and segmental walling linking matching blocks in a larger outer grassed court, it forms one of the most ambitious aristocratic ensembles of the late seventeenth century.\n\nA dining room was designed for the 8th Earl of Winchilsea, and installed in 1778.\n\nIn 1908, a fire broke out during a party attended by Winston Churchill, destroying the west part of the house.\n\nThe mansion was converted into six dwellings by Kit Martin in 1993–98, with a further 22 dwellings on the estate. Previously the estate had been purchased by Asil Nadir in 1991.\n\nThe church of the Holy Cross, adjacent to the mansion, is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It contains a moving memorial by Sir Francis Chantrey to Lady Charlotte Finch (1820).\n\nGeorge Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea, lived at the mansion in the late 18th century and used its grounds to stage a number of cricket matches, six of them first-class, between 1790 and 1793.

It was released on November 7, 2000 as the lead single from their fourth full-length studio album, \"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)\" (2000).\n\nIt was released in two standalone physical formats. The first, titled \"Disposable Teens Pt. 1,\" was released on November 6, 2000 in the UK. It features Manson's cover of John Lennon's \"Working Class Hero\". The second, titled \"Disposable Teens Pt. 2,\" followed on November 14, 2000 and features a cover of The Doors' \"Five to One\". \"Disposable Teens Pt. 2\" was also released as a 12\" picture disc vinyl LP.\n\nIt is considered a teenage anthem of sorts, echoing what Manson see as teenagers who act violently in retaliation against parental and social authority. The chorus borrows lyrically from The Beatles' song, \"Revolution.\" The song also paraphrases George Orwell's book \"1984\", the original line being \"You're only a rebel from the waist down'. Here, it has been given new meaning as a pop culture reference to Elvis Presley's infamous swiveling hips, satirizing the assertion that they, and by extension rock 'n' roll, had caused the \"decline of Western Civilization\" and given rise to 'disposable teens'.\n\nThe song is featured in \"\" during the opening credits. Professional wrestler Christopher Daniels has used the song as his theme in Ring of Honor and several independent promotions, as well as an instrumental remix for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling made by TNA's official music composer Dale Oliver. The song is also featured as downloadable content for \"Rock Band\" as part of the \"Mayhem Tour Pack\" and as a playable track for \"Guitar Hero Live\".\n\n\"Disposable Teens\" was composed by John 5 and Twiggy Ramirez. The lyrics were written by the band's frontman Marilyn Manson. During pre-release interviews, Manson described it as a \"signature Marilyn Manson song.\" Its bouncing guitar riff and teutonic staccato has roots in Gary Glitter's song \"Rock and Roll, Pt. 2\" and KISS's song \"I\" from their \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" album. Its lyrical themes tackled the disenfranchisement of contemporary youth, \"particularly those that have been [brought up] to feel like accidents\", with the revolutionary idealism of their parent's generation. The influence of The Beatles was critical in this song. The chorus echoed the Liverpool quartet's own disillusionment with the 1960s counterculture movement in the opening lines of their \"White Album\" song \"Revolution 1\". Here the sentiment was re-appropriated as a rallying cry for \"disposable teens\" against the shortcomings of \"this so-called generation of revolutionaries\", whom the song indicted: \"You said you wanted evolution, the ape was a great big hit. You say ya want a revolution, man, and I say that you're full of shit.\"\n\nThe music video was directed by Samuel Bayer and premiered on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" on October 25, 2000 (3:30-4:30pm EST). Manson asked Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM to help spread the word that the band is looking for 200 to 250 fans to dress in black and participate in the shoot. The clip was filmed in Los Angeles.\n\nThe video starts out with Manson rising slowly from what appears to be a lake (symbolic of the third and final beast). The video cuts between Manson in several different environments and outfits including a Pope outfit, as the food in a Last Supper reenactment and Manson himself performing to a crowd, surrounded by fascist looking police with crucifix shaped batons. As the video climaxes the crowd is seen overthrowing the guards.\n\nTwo versions of the video were released; one with the content mentioned above and another composing entirely of the stage performance footage from the original.\n\nAs early as the band's August 30, 2000, appearance at the Kerrang! Awards, Marilyn Manson expressed interest in covering Lennon's \"Working Class Hero\" due to its correlation with \"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)'s\" thematic preoccupations. The cover was recorded in the interim leading up to the November 7, 2000, launch of the single. In describing Lennon's idealism and influence on him Manson said that, \"some of Lennon's Communist sentiments in his music later in his life were very dangerous. I think he died because of it. I don't think his death was any sort of accident. Aside from that, I think he's one of my favorite songwriters of all time.\" Band members Manson, Ramirez, and John 5 later performed the song as part of a special invitation-only acoustic set at the Saci nightclub in New York City to celebrate the album's November 14, 2000, release.\n\nIn 2002, \"Kerrang!\" ranked \"Disposable Teens\" 73rd in their \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2186011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186011", "title": "Tensor tympani muscle", "text": "Tensor tympani muscle\n\nThe tensor tympani is a muscle within the middle ear, located in the bony canal above the bony part of the auditory tube, and connects to the malleus bone. Its role is to dampen loud sounds, such as those produced from chewing, shouting, or thunder. Because its reaction time is not fast enough, the muscle cannot protect against hearing damage caused by sudden loud sounds, like explosions or gunshots.\n\nThe tensor tympani is a muscle that is present in the middle ear. It arises from the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube, and the adjacent great wing of the sphenoid. It then passes through its own canal, and ends in the tympanic cavity as a slim tendon that connects to the handle of the malleus. The tendon makes a sharp bend around the \"processus cochleariformis\", part of the wall of its cavity, before it joins with the malleus.\n\nThe tensor tympani receives blood from the middle meningeal artery via the superior tympanic branch. It is one of two muscles in the tympanic cavity, the other being the stapedius.\n\nThe tensor tympani is supplied by the tensor tympani nerve, a branch of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. As the tensor tympani is supplied by motor fibers of the trigeminal nerve, it does not receive fibers from the trigeminal ganglion, which has sensory fibers only.\n\nThe tensor tympani muscle develops from mesodermal tissue in the 1st pharyngeal arch.\n\nThe tensor tympani acts to dampen the noise produced by chewing. When tensed, the muscle pulls the malleus medially, tensing the tympanic membrane and damping vibration in the ear ossicles and thereby reducing the perceived amplitude of sounds. It is one of the muscles involved in the acoustic reflex.\n\nContracting muscles produce vibration and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions per second (equivalent to 10 to 30 Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70 Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound can be heard by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound.\n\nSome individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply. This phenomenon has been known since (at least) 1884.\n\nThe tympanic reflex helps prevent damage to the inner ear by muffling the transmission of vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window. The reflex has a response time of 40 milliseconds, not fast enough to protect the ear from sudden loud noises such as an explosion or gunshot. Thus, the reflex most likely developed to protect early humans from loud thunder claps which do not happen in a split second.\n\nThe reflex works by contracting the muscles of the middle ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius. This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as benzodiazepines had been known to cause tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat.\n\nIn many people with hyperacusis, an increased activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear as part of the startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).\n\nThe mechanisms behind dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle and their consequences are hypotheses. However, in a published study, researchers studied the case of an acoustic shock whose mechanisms suggest dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle. This study appears to be the first to provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles (MEM) may behave abnormally after an acoustic shock. It is suggested that abnormal contractions (e.g. tonic contractions) of the tympanic tensor muscle may trigger neurogenic inflammation. Indeed, fibers with substances P and CGRP were found in close proximity.\n\n\n"}

It is the administrative centre of the Lienz district, which covers all of East Tyrol. The municipality also includes the cadastral subdivision of \"Patriasdorf\".\n\nLienz is located at the confluence of the rivers Isel and Drava in the Eastern Alps, between the Hohe Tauern mountain range in the north (including the Schober and Kreuzeck groups), and the Gailtal Alps in the south. It is connected with Winklern in Carinthia by the Iselsberg Pass. The neighbouring municipality of Leisach marks the easternmost point of the Puster Valley.\n\nBy the consistent growth of the city, some smaller villages around – though officially municipalities in their own right – are now widely considered to be suburbs of Lienz. Those suburbs comprise:\nThe area of Lienz had been settled since the Bronze Age about 2000 BC. Celtic people lived here from about 300 BC on, mainly as miners, who came under control of the Roman Empire in 15 BC. The area was incorporated into the province of Noricum and Emperor Claudius had a municipium called \"Aguntum\" erected near Lienz in the today's municipality of Dölsach. \"Aguntum\" became the see of an Early Christian bishop in the 5th century but decayed during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps and the subsequent fights with the Bavarii under King Tassilo I about 600. Part of the Slavic principality of Carantania, the area passed under Bavarian and finally Frankish suzerainty during the 8th century.\nLienz itself was first mentioned as \"Luenzina\" in a deed issued by the Bishop of Brixen about 1030. The settlement itself, together with neighbouring \"Patriasdorf\", then belonged of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, who were elevated to immediate landlords by Emperor Henry IV in 1077. It was then purchased by the scions of the Meinhardiner dynasty, who held the office of Aquileian \"Vögte\" (reeves) and chose Lienz as a residence. From about 1127 they called themselves Counts of Görz (Gorizia).\n\nLocated on the important trade route from Venzone in Friuli to Salzburg, the market town of Lienz received city rights on 25 February 1242. In 1278 the Counts finished \"Burg Bruck\", a castle that until 1500 served as their local seat. When the Meinhardiner became extinct in 1500 upon the death of Count Leonhard of Gorizia, their estates were bequeathed to the Habsburg King Maximilian I and finally incorporated into the County of Tyrol. From the status of an Imperial residence, Lienz sank to the insignificance of a provincial town within the Habsburg Monarchy.\nDuring the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, Lienz was occupied twice by French troops in 1797. After the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz, Lienz with Tyrol passed to the Electorate of Bavaria according to the 1805 Peace of Pressburg. In 1809 it became the administrative centre of a district within the short-lived Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces, but was reconquered by Austrian troops in 1813. Until 1918, the town was again part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in the Tyrol province.\n\nIn November 1918 it was occupied by the Italian Army. After World War I the southern parts of the former Cisleithanian crown land of Tyrol (i.e. Trentino and South Tyrol) were awarded to the Kingdom of Italy under the terms of the London Pact and the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, making the Lienz district of East Tyrol an exclave with no territorial connection to the mainland of North Tyrol. After the 1938 \"Anschluss\" of the Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany, the Lienz district became a part of the \"\"Reichsgau\"\" of Carinthia.\n\nOn 8 May 1945 British forces occupied Lienz, which together with Carinthia and Styria became part of the British occupation zone. At this time several thousand members of the former Wehrmacht 1st Cossack Division coming from Yugoslavia had arrived in and around Lienz. They surrendered to the British troops but were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.\n\nLienz has relatively warm and humid summers and cold winters. 1971–2000 there was a recorded precipitation of . Most of the rain falls during the summer months, especially from June to August (respectively ). The driest months are January and February ()\n\nThe average temperature is , in July it is about , in January . Lienz is also one of the sunniest cities in Austria with an average of 5.4 hours of sun per day or 1952 hours per year. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Dfb\" (humid continental).\n\nSeats in the municipal assembly (\"Gemeinderat\") elections:\n\nLienz is located at a road junction between the Drautalstraße highway, leading from Carinthia to the Puster Valley in the Italian province of South Tyrol (B100), and the Felbertauernstraße (B108) from Lienz to Mittersill in Salzburg. It is also connected by the Drautalbahn railway line from Villach to Innichen in South Tyrol. The Felbertauerntunnel between Mittersill and Lienz was completed in 1967.\n\n\nLienz is twinned with:\n\n"}

It is a satire of several theatrical, literary and film genres, including Victorian melodrama, farce, the penny dreadful, \"Wuthering Heights\" and the Alfred Hitchcock film \"Rebecca\" (1940). The title is the name of a character in the 1915 French movie serial \"Les Vampires\" and is an anagram for the word \"vampire.\"\n\nThe play is written for two actors who, between them, play eight characters of both sexes. In order to ensure cross-dressing, licenses to perform the play include a stipulation that the actors must be of the same sex. The show requires a large number of sound cues, props, special effects and quick costume changes. Some 35 costume changes take place in the course of the two-hour show.\n\nThe comedy includes references to (or appearances by) vampires, ghosts, mummies and werewolves. It contains the occasional jibe of an adult nature, but is largely acceptable for younger audiences. It is played in camp style. Ludlam said, however, \"Our slant was actually to take things very seriously, especially focusing on those \"things held in low esteem by society\" and revaluing them, giving them new meaning, new worth, by changing their context\". Ludlam \"twinned an ironic deconstruction of the horror genre with a high-camp celebration of it.\"\n\n\"The Mystery of Irma Vep\" was first produced by Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company, opening off-off-Broadway in New York City's Greenwich Village in September 1984 and closing in April 1986. It starred Ludlam as Lady Enid, the new mistress of the manor, and a butler, and Everett Quinton (Ludlam's lover) as Lord Edgar Hillcrest, the master of the manor, and the housekeeper (among other characters). The \"Cast and Crew\" won a Special Drama Desk Award. Ludlam and Quinton won the 1985 Obie Award for Ensemble Performance.\n\nThe show was later produced off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre from September 1998 through July 1999, with Quinton and Stephen DeRosa. The production won the 1999 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Revival, along with Outer Critics Circle Award nominations for Outstanding Revival of a Play, Outstanding Set Design (John Lee Beatty), and Outstanding Costume Design (William Ivey Long).\n\nIn 1991, \"Irma Vep\" was the most produced play in the United States, and in 2003, it became the longest-running play ever produced in Brazil. It was produced in the West End in London in 1990 at the Ambassadors Theatre, after a season at Leicester's Haymarket Theatre, starring Edward Hibbert and Nickolas Grace. Another New York City production ran at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in 2014.\n\nMandacrest Estate is the home of Lord Edgar, an Egyptologist, and Lady Enid. Lady Enid is Lord Edgar's second wife, though he has yet to recover entirely from the passing of his first wife, Irma Vep. The house staff, a maid named Jane Twisden and a swineherd named Nicodemus Underwood, have their own opinions of Lady Enid.\n\nEnid is attacked by a vampire, and Edgar seeks answers in an Egyptian tomb, briefly resurrecting the mummy of an Egyptian princess. Returning home with the sarcophagus, Edgar prepares to hunt down the werewolf he blames for the death of his son and first wife. Meanwhile, Enid discovers Irma locked away, supposedly to coax out the location of precious jewels from her. Wresting the keys to Irma's cell from Jane, Enid frees Irma only to discover the prisoner is, in fact, Jane herself, actually a vampire, and the killer of Irma as well as her and Edgar's son. Nicodemus, now a werewolf, kills Jane, only to be shot dead by Edgar.\n\nIn the end, Enid prevents Edgar from writing about his experiences in Egypt, revealing she was the princess herself, the whole thing an elaborate sham by her father to discredit Edgar.

{"id": "2186025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186025", "title": "Eastern brown snake", "text": "Eastern brown snake\n\nThe eastern brown snake (\"Pseudonaja textilis\"), often referred to as the common brown snake, is a highly venomous snake of the family Elapidae, native to eastern and central Australia and southern New Guinea. It was first described by André Marie Constant Duméril in 1854. The adult eastern brown snake is up to 2 m (7 ft) long with a slender build. Its variable upper parts can be several shades of brown, ranging from pale brown to almost black, while its underside is pale cream-yellow, often with orange or grey splotches. The eastern brown snake is found in most habitats except dense forests. It has become more common in farmland and on the outskirts of urban areas, benefiting from agriculture due to the increased numbers of its main prey, the introduced house mouse. The species is oviparous. The snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though its status in New Guinea is not well known.\n\nConsidered the world's second-most venomous land snake after the inland taipan (\"Oxyuranus microlepidotus\"), based on its value (subcutaneous) in mice, it is responsible for about 60% of snake-bite deaths in Australia. Its venom's main effects are on the circulatory system—coagulopathy, haemorrhage (bleeding), cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest. One of the main components of the venom is the prothrombinase complex pseutarin-C, which breaks down prothrombin.\n\nJohn White, the surgeon-general of the First Fleet to New South Wales, wrote \"A Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales\" in 1790, which described many Australian animal species for the first time. In it, he reported a snake that fit the description of the eastern brown snake, but did not name it. French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril was the first to describe the species in 1854. He gave it the binomial name \"Furina textilis\"—in French \"furine tricotée\" (knitted furin)—from a specimen collected in October 1846 by Jules Verreaux, remarking that the fine-meshed pattern on the snake's body reminded him of fine stockings, which was the inspiration for the name. Due to differences in appearance, different specimens of the eastern brown snake were categorized as different species in the early 19th century. German herpetologist Johann Gustav Fischer described it as \"Pseudoelaps superciliosus\" in 1856, from a specimen collected from Sydney. German-British zoologist Albert Günther described the species as \"Demansia annulata\" in 1858. Italian naturalist Giorgio Jan named \"Pseudoelaps sordellii\" and \"Pseudoelaps kubingii\" in 1859.\n\nGerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum, reclassified Duméril's species in the genus \"Pseudonaia\" [sic] in 1862 after collecting multiple specimens and establishing that the markings of young snakes faded as they grew into adult brown snakes. He concluded the original description was based on an immature specimen and sent an adult to Günther, who catalogued it under the new name the same year when cataloguing new species of snakes in the British Museum's collection. After examining all specimens, Günther concluded that \"Furina textilis\" and \"Diemansia annulata\" were named for young specimens and \"Pseudoelaps superciliosus\", \"P. sordelli\", and \"P. kubingii\" were named for adults, and all represented the same species, which he called \"Diemenia superciliosa\". Belgian-British naturalist George Albert Boulenger called it \"Diemenia textilis\" in 1896, acknowledging Duméril's name as having priority. In subsequent literature, it was known as \"Demansia textilis\" as \"Diemenia\" was regarded as an alternate spelling of \"Demansia\".\n\nThe brown snakes were moved from \"Diemenia/Demansia\" to \"Pseudonaja\" by Australian naturalist Eric Worrell in 1961 on the basis of skull morphology, and upheld by American herpetologist Samuel Booker McDowell in 1967 on the basis of the muscles of the venom glands. This classification has been followed by subsequent authors. In 2002, Australian herpetologist Richard W. Wells split the genus \"Pseudonaja\", placing the eastern brown snake in the new genus \"Euprepiosoma\", though this has not been recognized by other authors, and Wells has been strongly criticized for a lack of rigour in his research.\n\nWithin the genus \"Pseudonaja\", the eastern brown snake has the largest number of diploid chromosomes at 38; those of the other species range from 30 to 36. A 2008 study of mitochondrial DNA across its range showed three broad lineages: a southeastern clade from South Australia, Victoria, and southeastern and coastal New South Wales; a northeastern clade from northern and western New South Wales and Queensland; and a central (and presumably northern) Australian clade from the Northern Territory. The central Australian clade had colonised the region around Merauke in southern West Papua, and the northeastern clade had colonised Milne Bay, Oro, and Central Provinces in eastern Papua New Guinea in the Pleistocene via landbridges between Australia and New Guinea.\n\n\"P. textilis\" is monotypic. Raymond Hoser described all New Guinea populations as \"Pseudonaja textilis pughi\" based on a differing maxillary tooth count from Australian populations; this difference was inconsistent and, as no single New Guinea population is genetically distinct, the taxon is not recognised. Wells and C. Ross Wellington described \"Pseudonaja ohnoi\" in 1985 from a large specimen from Mount Gillen near Alice Springs, distinguishing it on the basis of scale numbers, but it is not regarded as distinct.\n\nThe species is commonly called the eastern brown snake or common brown snake. It was known as \"marragawan\" to the Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin. To the Dharawal of the Illawarra, it is \"goobalaang\". The Dharawal and Awabakal held ceremonies for the eastern brown snake. \"Warralang\" is the reconstructed name in the Wiradjuri language of southern New South Wales.\n\nThe eastern brown snake is of slender to average build with no demarcation between its head and neck. Its snout appears rounded when viewed from above. Most specimens have a total length (including tail) up to , with some large individuals reaching . The maximum recorded size for the species is . Evidence indicates that snakes from the northern populations tend to be larger than those from southern populations. The adult eastern brown snake is variable in colour. Its upper parts range from pale to dark brown, or sometimes shades of orange or russet, with the pigment more richly coloured in the posterior part of the dorsal scales. Eastern brown snakes from Merauke have tan to olive upper parts, while those from eastern Papua New Guinea are very dark grey-brown to blackish.\n\nThe eastern brown snake's fangs are small compared to those of other Australian venomous snakes, averaging 2.8 mm in length or up to 4 mm in larger specimens. They are 1.1 cm apart. The tongue is dark, and the irises are blackish with a paler yellow-brown or orange ring around the pupil. The snake's chin and under parts are cream or pale yellow, sometimes fading to brown or grey-brown towards the tail. Often, orange, brown, or dark grey blotches occur on the under parts, more prominent anteriorly. The ventral scales are often edged with dark brown on their posterior edges.\n\nJuveniles can vary in markings, but generally have a black head, with a lighter brown snout and band behind, and a black nuchal band. Their bodies can be uniform brown, or have many black bands, or a reticulated pattern, with all darker markings fading with age. Snake clutches in colder areas tend have a higher proportion of young snakes with banded markings on their bodies.\n\nIts yellowish under parts serve to distinguish it from the dugite (\"Pseudonaja affinis\") and peninsula brown snake (\"P. inframacula\"), which are entirely brown or brown with grey under parts. The eastern brown snake has flesh-pink skin inside its mouth, whereas the northern brown snake and western brown snake have black skin. Large eastern brown snakes are often confused with mulga snakes (\"Pseudechis australis\"), whose habitat they share in many areas, but may be distinguished by their smaller heads. Juvenile eastern brown snakes have head markings similar to red-naped snakes (\"Furina diadema\"), grey snakes (\"Hemiaspis damelii\"), Dwyer's snakes (\"Suta dwyeri\"), and the curl snake (\"Suta suta\").\n\nThe number and arrangement of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The eastern brown snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 192 to 231 ventral scales, 45 to 75 divided subcaudal scales (occasionally some of the anterior ones are undivided), and a divided anal scale. Its mouth is lined with six supralabial scales above and seven (rarely eight) sublabial scales below. Its nasal scale is almost always undivided, and rarely partly divided. Its eyes have two or rarely three postocular scales.\n\nThe eastern brown snake is found along the east coast of Australia, from Malanda in far north Queensland, along the coasts and inland ranges of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and to the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Disjunct populations occur on the Barkly Tableland and the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory. and the far east of the Kimberley in Western Australia, and discontinuously in parts of New Guinea, specifically northern Milne Bay Province and Central Province in Papua New Guinea, and the Merauke region of Papua Province, in the Indonesian part of New Guinea. It is common in southeastern Queensland between Ipswich and Beenleigh.\n\nThe eastern brown snake occupies a varied range of habitats from dry sclerophyll forests (eucalypt forests) and heaths of coastal ranges, through to savannah woodlands, inner grasslands, and arid scrublands and farmland, as well as drier areas that are intermittently flooded. It is more common in open habitat and also farmland and the outskirts of urban areas. It is not found in rainforests or other wet areas. Because of their mainly rodent diet, they can often be found near houses and farms. Such areas also provide shelter in the form of rubbish and other cover; the snakes use sheets of corrugated iron or buildings as hiding spots, as well as large rocks, burrows, and cracks in the ground.\n\nThe eastern brown snake is generally solitary, with females and younger males avoiding adult males. It is active during the day, though it may retire in the heat of hot days to come out again in the late afternoon. It is most active in spring, the males venturing out earlier in the season than females, and is sometimes active on warm winter days. Individuals have been recorded basking on days with temperatures as low as . Occasional nocturnal activity has been reported. At night, it retires to a crack in the soil or burrow that has been used by a house mouse, or (less commonly) skink, rat, or rabbit. Snakes may use the refuge for a few days before moving on, and may remain above ground during hot summer nights. During winter, they hibernate, emerging on warm days to sunbathe. Fieldwork in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area found that snakes spent on average 140 days in a burrow over winter, and that most males had entered hibernation by the beginning of May (autumn) while females did not begin till mid-May; the males mostly became active in the first week in September (spring), while the females not until the end of the month. The concrete slabs of houses have been used by eastern brown snakes hibernating in winter, with 13 recorded coiled up together under a 5m by 3m slab of a demolished house between Mount Druitt and Rooty Hill in western Sydney, and another 17 (in groups of one to four) under smaller slabs within 20 m in late autumn 1972. Groups of up to six hibernating eastern brown snakes have been recorded from under other slabs in the area. In July 1991 in Melton, six eastern brown snakes were uncovered in a nest in long grass.\n\nEastern brown snakes are very fast moving snakes, Australian naturalist David Fleay reported it could outpace a person running at full speed. Many people mistake defensive displays for aggression. When confronted, the eastern brown snake reacts with one of two neck displays. During a partial display, the snake raises the front part of its body horizontally just off the ground, flattening its neck and sometimes opening its mouth. In a full display, the snake rises up vertically high off the ground, coiling its neck into an S shape, and opening its mouth. The snake is able to strike more accurately from a full display and more likely to deliver an envenomed bite. Due to the snake's height off the ground in full display, the resulting bites are often on the victim's upper thigh.\n\nA field study in farmland around Leeton that monitored 455 encounters between eastern brown snakes and people found that the snake withdrew around half the time and tried to hide for almost all remaining encounters. In only twelve encounters did the snake advance. They noted that snakes were more likely to notice dark clothing and move away early, reducing the chance of a close encounter. Close encounters were more likely if a person were walking slowly, but a snake was less likely to be aggressive in this situation. Encountering male snakes on windy days with cloud cover heightened risk, as the snake was less likely to see persons until they were close, hence more likely to be startled. Similarly, walking in undisturbed areas on cool days in September and October risked running into courting male snakes that would not notice people until close as they were preoccupied with mating.\n\nEastern brown snakes generally mate from early October onwards—during the Southern Hemisphere spring; they are oviparous. Males engage in ritual combat with other males for access to females. The appearance of two males wrestling has been likened to a pleated rope. The most dominant male will mate with females in the area. The females produce a clutch of 10 to 35 eggs, with the eggs typically weighing each. The eggs are laid in a sheltered spot, such as a burrow or hollow inside a tree stump or rotting log. Multiple females may even use the same location, such as a rabbit warren. Ambient temperature influences the rate at which eggs develop; eggs incubated at hatch after 95 days, while those at hatch after 36 days. Eastern brown snakes can reach sexual maturity by 31 months of age, and have been reported to live up to 15 years in captivity.\n\nThe eastern brown snake appears to hunt by sight more than other snakes, and a foraging snake raises its head like a periscope every so often to survey the landscape for prey. It generally finds its food sources in their refuges rather than chasing fleeing prey. The adult is generally diurnal, while juveniles sometimes hunt at night. The eastern brown snake rarely eats during winter, and females rarely eat while pregnant with eggs. The eastern brown snake has been observed coiling around and constricting prey to immobilise and subdue it, adopting a strategy of poisoning and grappling their prey. Herpetologists Richard Shine and Terry Schwaner proposed that it might be resorting to constriction when attacking skinks as it might facilitate piercing the skink's thick scales with its small fangs.\nThe eastern brown snake's diet is made up almost wholly of vertebrates, with mammals predominating—particularly the introduced house mouse. Mammals as large as feral rabbits have been eaten. Small birds, eggs, and even other snakes are also consumed. Snakes in areas of natural vegetation or paddocks for stock eat a higher proportion of reptiles, while those in crop fields eat more mice. Small lizards such as skinks are more commonly eaten than frogs, as eastern brown snakes generally forage in areas over 100 m (350 ft) distant from water. Snakes larger than from snout to vent eat predominantly warm-blooded prey, while smaller snakes mainly eat ectothermic animals. Other snakes, such as the common death adder (\"Acanthophis antarcticus\"), and carpet python (\"Morelia spilota\"), have also been eaten. Cannibalism has also been recorded in young snakes. The bearded dragon is possibly resistant to the effects of the venom. Although the eastern brown snake is susceptible to cane toad toxins, young individuals avoid eating them, which suggests they have learned to avoid them. Some evidence indicates they are immune to their own venom and that of the mulga snake (\"Pseudechis australis\"), a potential predator.\n\nThe eastern brown snake is considered the second-most venomous terrestrial snake in the world, behind only the inland taipan (\"Oxyuranus microlepidotus\") of central east Australia. Responsible for more deaths from snakebite in Australia than any other species, it is the most commonly encountered dangerous snake in Adelaide, and is also found in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, and Brisbane. As a genus, brown snakes were responsible for 41% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, and for 15 of the 19 deaths during this period. Within the genus, the eastern brown snake is the species most commonly implicated. It is classified as a snake of medical importance by the World Health Organization.\nClinically, the venom of the eastern brown snake causes venom-induced consumption coagulopathy; a third of cases develop serious systemic envenoming including hypotension and collapse, thrombotic microangiopathy, severe haemorrhage, and cardiac arrest. Other common systemic symptoms include nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis (sweating), and abdominal pain. Acute kidney injury and seizures can also occur. Onset of symptoms can be rapid, with a headache developing in 15 minutes and clotting abnormalities within 30 minutes; collapse has been recorded as occurring as little as two minutes after being bitten. Death is due to cardiovascular causes such as cardiac arrest or intracranial haemorrhage. Often, little local reaction occurs at the site of the bite. The classical appearance is of two fangmarks around 1 cm apart. Neurotoxicity is rare and generally mild, and myotoxicity (rhabdomyolysis) has not been reported.\n\nThe eastern brown snake yields an average of under 5 mg of venom per milking, less than other dangerous Australian snakes. The volume of venom produced is largely dependent on the size of the snake, larger snakes producing more venom; Queensland eastern brown snakes produced over triple the average amount of venom (11 mg vs 3 mg) than those from South Australia. Worrell reported a milking of 41.4 mg from a relatively large 2.1-m (6.9-ft) specimen. The venom has a murine median lethal dose () has been measured at 41 μg/kg—when using 0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline rather than saline alone—to 53 μg/kg when administered subcutaneously. The composition of venom of captive snakes did not differ from that of wild snakes.\n\nThe eastern brown snake's venom contains coagulation factors VF5a and VF10, which together form the prothrombinase complex pseutarin-C. This cleaves prothrombin at two sites, converting it to thrombin. Pseutarin-C is a procoagulant in the laboratory, but ultimately an anticoagulant in snakebite victims, as the prothrombin is used up and coagulopathy and spontaneous bleeding set in. Another agent, textilinin, is a Kunitz-like serine protease inhibitor that selectively and reversibly inhibits plasmin. A 2006 study comparing the venom components of eastern brown snakes from Queensland with those from South Australia found that the former had a stronger procoagulant effect and greater antiplasmin activity of textilinin.\n\nThe venom also contains pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxins; textilotoxin is a presynaptic neurotoxin, at one stage considered the most potent recovered from any land snake. Making up 3% of the crude venom by weight, it is composed of six subunits. Existing in two forms, the venom weighs 83,770 ± 22 daltons (TxI) and about 87,000 daltons (TxII), respectively. Textilitoxin is a type of phospholipase A2, a group of enzymes with diverse effects that are commonly found in snake venoms. At least two further phospholipase A2 enzymes have been found in eastern brown snake venom. Two postsynaptic neurotoxins have been labelled pseudonajatoxin a and pseudonajatoxin b. These are three-finger toxins, a superfamily of proteins found in the venom of many elapid snakes and responsible for neurotoxic effects. Another three-finger toxin was identified in eastern brown snake venom in 2015. Professor Bart Currie coined the term ‘brown snake paradox' in 2000 to query why neurotoxic effects were rare or mild despite the presence of textilitoxin in eastern brown snake venom. This is thought to be due to the low concentration of the toxin in the venom, which is injected in only small amounts compared with other snake species.\n\nAnalysis of venom in 2016 found—unlike most other snake species—that the venom of juvenile eastern brown snakes differed from that of adults; prothrombinases (found in adults) were absent and the venom did not affect clotting times. Snakes found with a similar profile generally preyed upon dormant animals such as skinks.\n\nThe eastern brown snake is the second-most commonly reported species responsible for envenoming of dogs in New South Wales. Dogs and cats are much more likely than people to have neurotoxic symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. One dog bitten suffered a massive haemorrhage of the respiratory tract requiring euthanasia. The venom is uniformly toxic to warm-blooded vertebrates, yet reptile species differ markedly in their susceptibility.\n\nStandard first-aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake is for a pressure bandage to the bite site. The victims should move as little as possible, and to be conveyed to a hospital or clinic, where they should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Tetanus toxoid is given, though the mainstay of treatment is the administration of the appropriate antivenom. Brown snake antivenom has been available since 1956. Before this, tiger snake antivenom was used, though it was of negligible benefit in brown snake envenoming. The antivenom had been difficult to research and manufacture as the species was hard to catch, and the amount of venom it produced was generally insufficient for horse immunization, though these challenges were eventually overcome. Dogs and cats can be treated with a caprylic acid-fractionated, bivalent, whole IgG, equine antivenom.\n\nEastern brown snakes are readily available in Australia via breeding in captivity. They are regarded as challenging to keep, and due to the snakes' speed and toxicity, suitable for only experienced snake keepers.\n\n\n\n"}

The group started by performing at karaokes around Kampala and quickly gained a reputation for their original performances. They soon started performing at bigger events and caught the eye of local producer Steve Jean, with whom they recorded their first single, “Nothin’ Wrong Wit’ A Lil’ Doe.” The group became the first Ugandan hip hop group to be accepted among mainstream artists .\n\nKlear Kut then teamed up with Dawoo & Daudi (D&D) Productions to record the full-length album \"Mind, Body & Soul\". The album proved to be a success for the group, spawning the hits “All I Wanna Know” featuring Juliana and “Superstar” featuring Bebe Cool. The singles topped the charts in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. \nThe video for “All I Wanna Know” pioneered modern video production in Uganda. It earned the group two nominations at the prestigious 2002 Kora All Africa Music Awards in the “Most Promising African Group” and “Revelation of the Year” categories. This also made them the first Ugandan group to be nominated at the KORAs. Klear Kut was also nominated at the 2003 Pearl of Africa Music Awards and won the award for “Best Hip Hop Group.” The group also released another album, “K2”, which featured the hit single “Mon Coeur/Murder of Crows.” The video was on heavy rotation on WBS as well as TV Africa before the station's demise. The video topped the EATV Top 10 music video charts. The video would further create new records by being the first Ugandan music video to be featured on MTV . The album features Bebe Cool, TID, Benon, Rania, E-Von & Poetic.\n\nKlear Kut has built a solid reputation as live performers and has performed at a number of live outdoor events including the Shaggy Boombastic Concert, Miss Uganda, Tevin Campbell New Year Concert, Sanyu Carnival in Uganda, Miss Kenya and Coca-Cola Race Day in Kenya, Bongo All-Stars in Tanzania, Sauti Za Busara in Zanzibar. They have also performed at the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) alongside African greats such as Femi Kuti (Nigeria) and Habib Koite (Mali).\n\nThe group has been featured in the production of both audio and video commercials for companies such as Coca-Cola, MTN, PSI Protector, BB Soda, Allied Bank, Celtel, Guinness, and Pepsi. Klear Kut has also been involved in AIDS awareness and anti-smoking campaigns, performing and speaking to youth about those issues.\n\nAt the 2008 Kisima Music Awards Klear Kut was nominated for the Ugandan Video of the Year category for their video \"Klear discussion\" \n\n\n\n"}

From 1814 he studied in Gymnasium in Ausbach. He attended the University of Göttingen from 1818 to 1822 where he studied with Gauss who was director of the observatory. Staudt provided an ephemeris for the orbits of Mars and the asteroid Pallas. When in 1821 Comet Nicollet-Pons was observed, he provided the elements of its orbit. These accomplishments in astronomy earned him his doctorate from University of Erlangen in 1822.\n\nStaudt's professional career began as a secondary school instructor in Würzburg until 1827 and then Nuremberg until 1835. He married Jeanette Dreschler in 1832. They had a son Eduard and daughter Mathilda, but Jeanette died in 1848.\n\nThe book \"Geometrie der Lage\" (1847) was a landmark in projective geometry. As Burau (1976) wrote:\nFurthermore, this book (page 43) uses the complete quadrangle to \"construct the fourth harmonic associated with three points on a straight line\", the projective harmonic conjugate.\n\nIndeed, in 1889 Mario Pieri translated von Staudt, before writing his \"I Principii della Geometrie di Posizione Composti in un Systema Logico-deduttivo\" (1898). In 1900 Charlotte Scott of Bryn Mawr College paraphrased much of von Staudt's work in English for \"The Mathematical Gazette\". When Wilhelm Blaschke published his textbook \"Projective Geometry\" in 1948, a portrait of the young Karl was placed opposite the \"Vorwort\".\n\nStaudt went beyond real projective geometry and into complex projective space in his three volumes of \"Beiträge zur Geometrie der Lage\" published from 1856 to 1860.\n\nIn 1922 H. F. Baker wrote of von Staudt's work:\n\nVon Staudt is also remembered for his view of conic sections and the relation of pole and polar:\n\nIn 1857, in the second \"Beiträge\", von Staudt contributed a route to number through geometry called the algebra of throws (). It is based on projective range and the relation of projective harmonic conjugates. Through operations of addition of points and multiplication of points, one obtains an \"algebra of points\", as in chapter 6 of Veblen & Young's textbook on projective geometry. The usual presentation relies on cross ratio (\"CA,BD\") of four collinear points. For instance, Coolidge wrote:\n\nA summary statement is given by Veblen & Young as Theorem 10: \"The set of points on a line, with formula_3 removed, forms a field with respect to the operations previously defined\". As Freudenthal notes\n\nAnother affirmation of von Staudt's work with the harmonic conjugates comes in the form of a theorem:\n\nThe algebra of throws was described as \"projective arithmetic\" in \"The Four Pillars of Geometry\" (2005).\nIn a section called \"Projective arithmetic\", he says\n\nIf one interprets von Staudt’s work as a construction of the real numbers, then it is incomplete. One of the required properties is that a bounded sequence has a cluster point. As Hans Freudenthal observed:\n\nOne of the Italian mathematicians was Giovanni Vailati who studied the circular order property of the real projective line. The science of this order requires a quaternary relation called the separation relation. Using this relation, the concepts of monotone sequence and limit can be addressed, in a cyclic \"line\". Assuming that every monotone sequence has a limit, the line becomes a complete space. These developments were inspired by von Staudt’s deductions of field axioms as an initiative in the derivation of properties of ℝ from axioms in projective geometry.\n\nThe following links are to Cornell University Historical Mathematical Monographs:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2186064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186064", "title": "Poljot", "text": "Poljot\n\nPoljot (, literally meaning \"flight\"), is a brand of Soviet/Russian wristwatches, produced since 1964 by the First Moscow Watch Factory (, \"Perviy Moskovskiy Chasovoy Zavod\"). The flagship brand of the USSR's watch industry, Poljot produced numerous historical watches used in many important space missions, including the world's first space watch worn by Yuri Gagarin.\n\nFounded in 1930 under orders from Joseph Stalin, the First State Watch Factory () was the first large scale Soviet watch and mechanical movement manufacturer. Via its USA-based trading company Amtorg, the Soviet government bought the defunct Ansonia Clock Company of Brooklyn, New York in 1929, and the Dueber-Hampden Watch Company of Canton, Ohio. It moved twenty-eight freight cars full of machinery and parts from the USA to Moscow in order to establish the factory. Twenty-one former Dueber-Hampden watchmakers, engravers and various other technicians helped to train the Russian workers in the art of watchmaking as part of the Soviet's first five-year plan. The movements of very-early products were still stamped \"Dueber-Hampden, Canton, Ohio, USA\" (examples of these watches are very collectible today). In 1935 the factory was named after the murdered Soviet official Sergei Kirov.\n\nAs the Germans closed in on Moscow in 1941, the factory was hurriedly evacuated to Zlatoust (). By 1943 the Germans were in retreat, and the factory moved back to Moscow, adopting the \"First Moscow Watch Factory\" name ().\n\nIn 1947 the first wristwatches under the brand name \"Pobeda\" and the first Marine Chronometers and Deck watches were produced. By 1951 the production of wristwatches had increased to 1.1 million. In 1975 new machinery and equipment for manufacturing complex watches was imported from Switzerland. The first chronograph \"Okean\" (caliber 3133) was produced for the space station \"Sojuz-23.\"\n\nIn 1990 production of watches and clocks reached 5 million pieces, and in 1991 the international award \"Golden Trophy for Quality\" was awarded in Madrid.\n\nOn 12 April 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space. The watch Gagarin wore was made by the First Moscow Watch Company under the name Sturmanskie, which translates to \"Navigator's\". Today's owner of the brand, Volmax (based in both Moscow and Switzerland), is the only authorized company allowed to use Gagarin's name and likeness in watch production. Gagarin received his 15-jewel watch with a manual-wind Poljot movement when he graduated from the Soviet air force flight school in 1957. The original watches were built exclusively for the Soviet Air Force and not available to the public. Publicly available versions of the model were not released until years later. At 33 mm in diameter, the original watch was small by today's standards. The watch performed flawlessly in space and is currently on display at the Moscow Museum of Cosmonautics. Commemorative editions produced today are 40 mm and have a 17-jewel Poljot movement.\n\nIn 1965 cosmonaut Alexei Leonov wore an FMWF Strela (transliteration of СТРЕЛА, which actually means \"Arrow\") chronograph during his historic first space walk, thus cementing Poljot's place in space history. As with Gagarin's first flight, Leonov's watch was not specially commissioned. The Strela replaced the Shturmanskie as the standard issue pilots watch.\nIn the late 1970s, the Strela itself was replaced by a new breed of chronographs based around the (then new) 3133 movement (an original Russian movement similar in functionality to the Swiss Valjoux 7734, but with higher number of jewels 23 vs 17 and lever movement operating at 21,600 bph vs 18,000 bph). Poljot 3133-based watches continued where their predecessors left off and were taken into space by cosmonauts from Russia, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the wrist of cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, a Poljot 3133-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, Soviet watch brands including Poljot, but also Raketa watches, were marketed in the United Kingdom under the brand \"Sekonda\". Today's Sekonda company, a British distributor of ubiquitous fashion watches, has no connection to any Russian watches.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the First Moscow Watch Factory began reproducing many of their most famous models as limited edition commemorative pieces. Replicas were made of the famous 1960s Shturmanskie worn by Yuri Gagarin, the 1940s Kirova pilots chronograph, and the 1970s Ocean () chronograph. All of the replicas became collectables.\n\nIn late 2003, rumours predicting the demise of the Poljot brand circulated on the Internet. According to the rumours, the First Moscow Watch Factory was to cease producing their own models and become a source of inexpensive movements for other European watch brands. These rumours never came to fruition. Instead, in the late 2000s, the company was bought by the businessman Sergeï Pugachev, becoming one of the companies of his new luxury group, including: Hédiard, and the channel Luxe TV. The physical remnants of First Moscow Watch Factory were purchased by a group of former Poljot employees, forming the basis for a new company, Volmax. Volmax marketed watches under the Aviator, Buran and Shturmanskie brands using movements produced by another Russian firm, MakTime.\n\nAs of 2012, the status of the Poljot brand is unclear, though the brand appears to be moribund. MakTime, the company utilizing old Poljot equipment to manufacture mechanical movements, went bankrupt, and Volmax, the successor company to First Moscow Watch Factory relocated to Switzerland. Present models from the Volmax company are Swiss-made, using design cues from vintage Russian models.\n\n\n"}

It is oriented towards children, youth and innovative television.\n\nInitially the third Dutch public television channel would be a joint venture with the Flemish public broadcaster VRT (then called BRTN), which would specialize in a cooperative Netherlands/Flanders programming. With the pretended cooperation, BRT (now VRT) would either continue or terminate its second channel by operating it more lucratively. This plan failed but later resulted in a new television channel targeting Dutch and Flemish people living abroad. Two Dutch broadcasters, NPO and RNW, launched BVN as Zomer TV in 1996, and all of its programming originally came from the Netherlands (the abbreviation BVN at first standing for het Beste Van Nederland, \"the best of the Netherlands\"), this however changed, once the VRT began contributing both financially and delivering programmes, changing the channel from specializing in programming from the Netherlands to specializing in Dutch programming from the Netherlands and Flanders.\n\nNPO 3 was established as 'Nederland 3' on 4 April 1988, however the channel was used for experimental purposes for the Winter Olympic Games in Calgary earlier on in the year. Nederland 3 became the home channel of the broadcasters VPRO, VARA, RVU, and NPS, all of which share a progressive outlook. The initial emphasis was news, culture and sports.\n\nIn September 2000, AVRO, BNN, EO, KRO and TROS later joined this channel in producing more content for its programming output. The channel focused on news, debate, culture and innovative television. Before the evening the channel's programming, under the label of Z@ppelin, was aimed at children.\n\nIn September 2006, the programming of NPO's television channels changed slightly. Nederland 3 still focuses on children during the daytime. In the evenings it aims to reach an open-minded audience with innovative, educational television and occasionally sports. All Dutch public broadcasting organizations have air-time on Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3; youth-oriented broadcaster BNN broadcast only on Nederland 3.\n\nOn 15 September 2007 the NPO channels Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3 switched completely to anamorphic widescreen, before that time some of the programming was already broadcast in widescreen.\n\nOn 4 July 2009 all three channels began simulcasting in 1080i high-definition.

{"id": "2186113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186113", "title": "Okadaic acid", "text": "Okadaic acid\n\nOkadaic acid, CHO, is a toxin produced by several species of dinoflagellates, and is known to accumulate in both marine sponges and shellfish. One of the primary causes of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of specific protein phosphatases and is known to have a variety of negative effects on cells. A polyketide, polyether derivative of a C fatty acid, okadaic acid and other members of its family have shined light upon many biological processes both with respect to dinoflagellete polyketide synthesis as well as the role of protein phosphatases in cell growth.\n\nAs early as 1961, reports of gastrointestinal disorders following the consumption of cooked mussels appeared in both the Netherlands and Los Lagos. Attempts were made to determine the source of the symptoms, however they failed to elucidate the true culprit, instead implicating a species of microplanctonic dinoflagellates. In the summers of the late 1970s, a series of food poisoning outbreaks in Japan lead to the discovery of a new type of shellfish poisoning. Named for the most prominent symptoms, the new Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) only affected the northern portion of Honshu during 1976, however by 1977 large cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama were affected. Research into the shellfish consumed in the affected regions showed that a fat-soluble toxin was responsible for the 164 documented cases, and this toxin was traced to mussels and scallops harvested in the Miyagi prefecture. In northeastern Japan, a legend had existed that during the season of paulownia flowers, shellfish can be poisonous. Studies following this outbreak showed that toxicity of these mussels and scallops appeared and increased during the months of June and July, and all but disappeared between August and October.\n\nElsewhere in Japan, in 1975 Fujisawa pharmaceutical company observed that the extract of a black sponge, \"Halichondria okadai\", was a potent cytotoxin, and was dubbed Halichondrine-A. In 1981, the structure of one such toxin, okadaic acid, was determined after it was extracted from both the black sponge in Japan, \"Halichondria okadai\", for which it was named, and a sponge in the Florida Keys, \"Halichondria melanodocia\". Okadaic acid sparked research both for its cytotoxic feature and for being the first reported marine ionophore.\n\nOne of the toxic culprits of DSP, dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), named for one of the organisms implicated in its production, \"Dinophysis fortii\", was compared to and shown to be very chemically similar to okadaic acid several years later, and okadaic acid itself was implicated in DSP around the same time. Since its initial discovery, reports of DSP have spread throughout the world, and are especially concentrated in Japan, South America and Europe.\n\nOkadaic acid (OA) and its derivatives, the dinophysistoxins (DTX), are members of a group of molecules called polyketides. The complex structure of these molecules include multiple spiroketals, along with fused ether rings.\n\nBeing polyketides, the okadaic acid family of molecules are synthesized by dinoflagellates via polyketide synthase (PKS). However unlike the majority of polyketides, the dinoflagellate group of polyketides undergo a variety of unusual modifications. Okadaic acid and its derivatives are some of the most well studied of these polyketides, and research on these molecules via isotopic labeling has helped to elucidate some of those modifications.\n\nOkadaic acid is formed from a starter unit of glycolate, found at carbons 37 and 38, and all subsequent carbons in the chain are derived from acetate. Because polyketide synthesis is similar to fatty acid synthesis, during chain extension the molecule may undergo reduction of the ketone, dehydration, and reduction of the olefin. Failure to perform one of more of these three steps, combined with several unusual reactions is what allows for the formation of the functionality of okadaic acid. Carbon deletion and addition at the alpha and beta position comprise the other transformations present in the okadaic acid biosynthesis.\n\nCarbon deletion occurs by way of a Favorskii rearrangement and subsequent decarboxylation. Attack of a ketone in the growing chain by enzyme-bound acetates, and subsequent decarboxylation/dehydration results in an olefin replacing the ketone, in both alpha and beta alkylation. After this the olefin can isomerize to more thermodynamically stable positions, or can be activated for cyclizations, in order to produce the natural product.\n\nTo date, several studies have been performed toward the synthesis of okadaic acid and its derivatives. 3 total syntheses of okadaic acid have been achieved, along with many more formal syntheses and several total syntheses of the other dinophysistoxins. The first total synthesis of okadaic acid was completed in 1986 by Isobe et al., just 5 years after the molecule's structure was elucidated. The next two were completed in 1997 and 1998 by the Forsyth and Ley groups respectively.\n\nIn Isobe's synthesis, the molecule was broken into 3 pieces, along the C14-C15 bonds, and the C27-C28 bonds. This formed fragments A, B, and C, which were all synthesized separately, after which the B and C fragments were combined, and then combined with the A fragment. This synthesis contained 106 steps, with a longest linear sequence of 54 steps. The precursors to all three fragments were all glucose derivatives obtained from the chiral pool. Spiroketals were obtained from precursor ketone diols, and were therefore formed thermally in acid.\nSimilar to Isobe's synthesis, the Forsyth synthesis sought to reduce the number of steps, and to increase potential for designing analogues late in the synthesis. To do this, Forsyth et al. designed the synthesis to allow for structural changes and installation of important functional groups before large pieces were joined. Their resulting synthesis was 3% yielding, with 26 steps in the longest linear sequence. As above, spiroketalization was performed thermodynamically with introduction of acid.\nLey's synthesis of okadaic acid is most unlike its predecessors, although it still contains similar motifs. Like the others, this synthesis divided okadaic acid into three components along the acyclic segments. However, designed to display new techniques developed in their group, Ley's synthesis included forming the spiroketals using (diphenylphosphineoxide)-tetrahydrofuran and (phenylsulfonyl)-tetrahydropyrans, allowing for more mild conditions. Similar to those above, a portion of the stereochemistry in the molecule was set by starting materials obtained from the chiral pool, in this case mannose.\n\nOkadaic acid (OA) and its relatives are known to strongly inhibit protein phosphatases, specifically serine/threonine phosphatases. Furthermore, of the 4 such phosphatases, okadaic acid and its relatives specifically target protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), at the exclusion of the other two, with dissociation constants for the two proteins of 150 nM and 30 pM respectively. Because of this, this class of molecules has been used to study the action of these phosphatases in cells. Once OA binds to the phosphatase protein(s), it results in hyperphosphorylation of specific proteins within the afflicted cell, which in turn reduces control over sodium secretion and solute permeability of the cell. Affinity between okadaic acid and its derivatives and PP2A has been tested, and it was shown that the only derivative with a lower dissociation constant, and therefore higher affinity, was DTX1, which has been shown to be 1.6 times stronger. Furthermore, for the purpose of determining the toxicity of mixtures of different okadaic acid derivatices, inhibitory equivalency factors for the relatives of okadaic acid have been studied. In wild type PP2A, the inhibitory equivalency relative to okadaic acid were 0.9 for DTX-1 and 0.6 for DTX-2.\n\nThe main route of exposure to DSP from okadaic acid and its relatives is through the consumption of shellfish. It was initially shown that the toxic agents responsible for DSP tend to be most concentrated in the hepatopancreas, followed by the gills for certain shellfish. The symptoms for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning include intense diarrhea and severe abdominal pains, and rarely nausea and vomiting, and they tend to occur anytime between 30 minutes and at most 12 hours after consuming toxic shellfish. It has been estimated that it takes roughly 40 μg of okadaic acid to produce diarrhetic effects in adult humans.\n\nBecause of its inhibitory effects in phosphatases, okadaic acid has shown promise in the world of medicine for numerous potential uses. During its initial discovery, okadaic acid, specifically the crude source extract, showed potent inhibition of cancer cells, and so initial interest in the family of molecules tended to center around that feature. However, it was shown that the more cytotoxic component of \"H. Okadai\" was actually a separate family of compounds, the Halichondrines, and as such research into the cytotoxicity of okadaic acid decreased. However, the unique function of okadaic acid upon cells maintained biological interest in the molecule. Okadaic acid has been shown to have neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and embryotoxic effects. Furthermore, in two-stage carcinogenesis of mouse skin, the molecule and its relatives have been shown to have tumor promoting effects. Because of this, the effects of okadaic acid on Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, and other human diseases have been studied.\n\n"}

Beginning in the 1950s, the Bauhaus designer Max Bill created clocks and watches for Junghans and the relationship lasted many years. A remarkable example of his work is a wall clock he designed in 1956–57 that is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art. In 1962 Bill also created mechanical wristwatches for Junghans. They were the official timekeeper for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.\nIn the late 1980s, Junghans introduced the first radio-controlled table clock on the world market. In 1990 the first radio-controlled wristwatch, called the \"MEGA 1\", followed. In 1995 Junghans presented a solar-powered watch with ceramic housing. Together with the Japanese clock maker Seiko, Junghans developed a globally-oriented wristwatch that automatically sets the local time in respective time zones.\n\nThe \"Junghans Microtec GmbH\" produces fuze-technology for artillery, mortar, medium-calibre, tanks, anti-tank and cruise missiles.

The Saga was composed in Iceland during the 13th century. It exists in several manuscripts which vary from each other. There are many different versions and translations of the saga.\nAt the time of writing, Wolin, also known as Willon, off the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, was not more than a typical market town of the 13th century. However, the \"Jómsvíkinga saga\" tells the story of its founding, centuries earlier, as the famed Jómsborg (Jomsborg) by the legendary Danish chieftain Pálna-Tóki. Jómsborg's name is composed of two elements: the Old Norse term \"borg,\" meaning a citadel, and the unidentified term, \"Jóm\". The Jómsvíkinga saga is centered around the tensions between Haraldr Gormsson of Denmark, Hákon Sigurðarson of Norway, and the Jómsvíkings. The Jómsvíkings challenged royal authority in the midst of a power struggle between Denmark and Norway. In order to better understand the Jómsvíkinga saga, it is important to understand the relationship between Denmark and Norway around this time. In addition to founding Jómsborg, Pálna-Tóki founded the brotherhood of Jómsvíkings. The saga describes the brotherhood and the laws of the Jómsvíkings (Jomsvikings). It also mentions their defeat during the semi-legendary naval Battle of Hjörungavágr in 986. This battle occurred between the Jarls of Lade and the Danish invasion fleet of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark. Jómsvíking chieftain, Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, led the Jómsvíkings in an effort to depose Jarl Hákon Sigurðarson, vassal ruler of Norway. The Jómsvíkings lived monastically and primarily in the Baltic region. The only things that are proven to have existed that were mentioned in the Jómsvíkinga saga are many of the main characters (excluding Pálna-Tóki), the Battle of Hjörungavágr, and the existence of Jómsborg. Aside from those things, the rest is an unsolved mystery.\n\nThere are five versions of the Jómsvíkinga saga that have been recovered over the years. The first, MS AM.291, is an incomplete manuscript written by an Icelander in the late thirteenth century. The second, MS AM. 510 4to, was written in the fifteenth century and contains much more information than the other versions. The third, Codex Holmanius 7, written in the fourteenth century, is shorter than the other versions and gives a brief summary of the saga. The fourth, Flateyjarbók, is a combination of the Jómsvíking saga and the Greater saga of Óláfr Tryggvason. Lastly, the fifth version, was a Latin translation of Arngrímr Jónsson written in the year 1592.\n\nHistorians have found it difficult to classify the \"Jómsvíkinga saga\" among the Old Norse sagas. It is sometimes counted among the Kings' sagas based principally upon the association with Danish kings. Both the Kings' sagas and the Jómsvíkinga saga can be looked at through a political lens. \"History and fantasy in Jómsvíkinga saga\" in \"The Fantastic in Old Norse/Icelandic Literature: Preprint Papers of the 13th International Saga Conference\" (Durham: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006) \n\n\n\n\n"}

Arnell composed in all the established genres for the concert stage, and his list of works includes six completed symphonies (a seventh was realised by Martin Yates) and six string quartets. At the Trinity College of Music, he \"promoted a pioneering interest in film scores and electronic music\" and jazz.\n\nArnell was born in Hampstead, London, the son of Hélène Marie (Scherf) and Richard Sayer Arnell. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London from 1935 to 1939, and was taught there by John Ireland (composition) and St John Dykes (piano). He was awarded the Farrar Prize for composition during his final year at the college. At the outset of the Second World War, attending the New York World Fair, Arnell (along with other English composers, e.g. Arthur Bliss) was stranded in New York, and stayed on until 1947, thereby finding himself in the position of having an established reputation in the US, but remaining relatively little known in his homeland. During his American sojourn, Arnell was the Music Supervisor for the BBC in North America, and was commissioned to compose (to a text by Stephen Spender) a cantata, \"The War God\", in celebration of the opening of the United Nations, as well as a fanfare to greet Winston Churchill's arrival in New York.\n\nHis music has been championed by Thomas Beecham, Leopold Stokowski and Bernard Herrmann, among others and more recently by Warren Cohen and Martin Yates (one of his composition students at Trinity). Between 1947 and 1987 he taught at Trinity College of Music in London, where his students included Peter Tahourdin (1949–52). Electronic composer David Hewson, who worked with him on films including \"Dilemma\" (1981), \"Doctor in the Sky\" (1984), \"Toulouse-Lautrec\" (1986), and \"The Light of the World\" (1989), was one of his pupils.\n\nArnell composed the music for \"The Land\" (1942), a 45-minute documentary film directed by Robert J. Flaherty for the US Department of Agriculture. He was also commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to compose a symphonic suite inspired by the workers in the factory at Dagenham. The resulting work accompanies a film entitled \"Opus 65\". Arnell established and headed the Music Department at the London International Film School until his retirement in the late 1980s. Mention must also be made of Arnell's extraordinary support and concern for a large number of musicians and artists both young and old as can be seen in his friendship and support for the painter, Mark Rothko.\n\nHe was also known for his major works for the ballet as can be seen in his collaborations with choreographers of the stature of George Balanchine, John Cranko and Frederick Ashton. His many ballets have been successfully staged in both New York and London. His score for \"Punch and the Child\" was recorded by Sir Thomas Beecham with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, a recording which has seldom been out of the catalogue.\n\nAll seven of Arnell's numbered symphonies together with the \"Sinfonia Quasi Variazioni\", the Piano Concerto (soloist David Owen Norris), the two Violin Concertos (soloist Lorraine MacAslan), \"Lord Byron: a Symphonic Portrait\", \"Robert Flaherty Impression\", \"Prelude The Black Mountain\" and the early Overture \"The New Age\", received their world premiere recordings by conductor Martin Yates and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra between 2005 and 2008. The premiere recordings of the ballets \"The Angels\", \"Harlequin in April\" and \"The Great Detective\", together with \"Punch and the Child\", were recorded by Martin Yates and the BBC Concert Orchestra in 2008–09.\n\nArnell had left sketches for a Seventh Symphony, dedicated to Nelson Mandela, at the time of his death, and it has since been realised and completed by Martin Yates. It was recorded in the summer of 2010 by Yates and the RSNO and was issued by Dutton Epoch. The String Quartets have recently been released on the Dutton Epoch label played by the Tippett Quartet.\nArnell is acknowledged as being one of the most masterly orchestrators of the twentieth century, Sir Thomas Beecham describing him as the best orchestrator since Berlioz.\n\nSome of his manuscripts are in the collection of the University of California, Santa Barbara library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It lies east of the Lesser Sunda Islands, which include nearby Alor and Timor, but it is politically part of the Maluku Islands. To the south, across the Wetar Strait, lies the island of Timor; at its closest it is 50 km away. To the west, across the Ombai Strait, lies the island of Alor. To the southwest is the very small island of Liran, which is also part of Wetar district (\"kecamatan\") and, further southwest, the small East Timorese island of Atauro. To the north is the Banda Sea and to the east lie Romang and Damar Islands, while to the southeast lie the other principal islands of the Barat Daya Islands. Including Liran, Wetar has an area of 2,651.9 km, and had a population of 7,916 at the 2010 Census.\n\nWetar is one of the 92 officially listed outlying islands of Indonesia.\n\nThe principal towns on Wetar are Lioppa in the northwest, Ilwaki in the south, Wasiri in the north, Masapun in the east, and Arwala in the northeast. These are connected by roads.\n\nWetar is 120 km long (measured from to east-most tip to west-most tip), and about 43 km north-to-south. It has an area of approximately 2652 km. It is surrounded by coral reefs and deep seas. The highest point on the island is 1412 m.\n\nWetar is part of a volcanic island arc which includes the other Barat Daya Islands and the Banda Islands, created by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is not, however, principally of volcanic origin, being instead mainly oceanic crust that has been lifted by the plate collision. The stratovolcano Gunungapi Wetar forms an isolated island to the north of Wetar.\n\nThere are a number of gold mines on Wetar, which have been poorly managed and constitute an environmental concern.\n\nAlong with other nearby islands, it formed part of Wallacea, the area of deep water separated from both the Asian and Australian continental shelves. This region is known for its unusual fauna, and Wetar is no exception. It has 162 species of birds, three of which are endemic, and four of which are endangered. Rainfall is highly seasonal based on the monsoon, and the islands are mostly covered in tropical dry broadleaf forests that are partly deciduous, with many trees losing their leaves in the dry season. It forms part of the Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion. \n\nThe island has a single lake, Danau Tihu.\n\nThere are a number of Malayo-Polynesian languages endemic to Wetar and the nearby islands of Liran and Atauro. Called \"Wetarese\", they are Aputai, Ili'uun, Perai, and Tugun. There is also Talur, a dialect of Galoli of East Timor. These are spoken by small groups of about 1,000 people each. The national language Indonesian and regional Ambonese Malay are commonly used.\n\nThe main economic activity on Wetar is subsistence agriculture, principally of sago. Tortoise shells are also gathered and exported to countries where the trade is not banned.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2186152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186152", "title": "Mallard Fillmore", "text": "Mallard Fillmore\n\nMallard Fillmore is a comic strip written and illustrated by Bruce Tinsley until 2019 and Loren Fishman since 2020. It has been syndicated by King Features Syndicate since June 6, 1994. The strip follows the exploits of its title character, an anthropomorphic green-plumaged duck who works as a politically conservative reporter at fictional television station WFDR in Washington, D.C. Mallard's name is a pun on the name of the 13th president of the United States, Millard Fillmore.\n\nIn 1991, Bruce Tinsley, who was an editorial cartoonist for the Charlottesville, Virginia paper \"The Daily Progress\", was asked to create a cartoon character as a mascot for the newspaper's entertainment page. A duck, which Bruce named \"Mallard Fillmore,\" was accepted, and made his debut in the paper.\n\nTinsley started sending samples of Mallard Fillmore, then known as \"The Fillmore File\", to newspapers across the country and was eventually picked up by \"The Washington Times\", which began running it in 1992. The strip was later picked up for national syndication by King Features Syndicate, which began distributing it in May 1994.\n\nTinsley's work is frequently the target of criticism from protected groups, due largely to his depictions of black people, Muslims, Palestinians, feminists, secularists immigrants, gays, and transgender individuals being perceived as offensive. The public outcry from these particular strips, among others, has led to the comic being pulled from numerous publications.\n\nAfter November 23rd, 2019, Mallard Fillmore stopped updating with new content and instead reprinted old comics. On March 9th, 2020, new comics of Mallard Fillmore have been produced under the signature of a different artist, Fishman. \n\nMallard Fillmore is the main character in the comic strip. He is a seasoned conservative reporter for fictional television station WFDR-TV in Washington, D.C., which hired him in order to fill its quota for \"Amphibious Americans.\"\n\nAlthough Mallard is a mallard duck, he is only occasionally shown with a mallard's coloring. Even when the daily strip is printed in color, Mallard generally appears as solid black. He does not exhibit any ducklike behaviour, and the other characters (who are all human) never comment on his species, except in the strip setting up the premise.\n\nMallard yearns for the \"good old days,\" and views himself as a victimized underdog in a world that is being overrun with political correctness, religious secularism, and hypocrisy. He is often in a state of outrage over the news item of the day, usually involving liberals.\n\nMallard's politics are very close to, if not one and the same as, cartoonist Bruce Tinsley's; Tinsley told the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" that \"Mallard really is about as close to me as you can get,\" in an October 2005 interview.\n\nAlthough WFDR appears to be a small, local channel, Mallard is still capable of interviewing famous politicians such as Al Gore. Occasionally, he will mention a study done by the \"Fillmore Foundation,\" a think tank which may or may not actually exist in the comic strip, which he presumably heads. Mallard seems to be conscious of the fact that he is a fictional cartoon character, and is capable of \"feeling poorly drawn.\" Mallard is also a bachelor, though in 2002 he had a date with a human woman he met in line at the post office. The date did not go well because he did not agree with her politics. He appears to be quite fond of Ann Coulter. Mallard did not attend journalism school, a fact repeatedly commented on in the comic, usually as an explanation as to why Mallard does not understand something about the WFDR news priorities.\n\nOther characters from the strip:\n\n\nIn the 2004 book \"America (The Book)\", written by the staff of \"The Daily Show\", a parody of \"Mallard Fillmore\" appears in a section about political cartoons (which also included parodies of \"Peanuts\" and \"Doonesbury\" strips). In the parody, Mallard criticizes legislation protecting the environment, as well as the income tax, and concludes \"Ooops! I forgot to tell a joke!\"\n\nIn the strip's 5–8 July 2005 editions, Tinsley responded to the \"America (The Book)\" parody, claiming that Jon Stewart \"tried to deceive people into thinking it was a real [\"Mallard Fillmore\" strip]\" by using the comic's name and a fictitious date.\n\nThe 2006 paperback \"\"Teacher's Edition\"\" of \"America (The Book)\" further addresses this controversy. On the page with the \"Mallard\" strip, Stanley K. Shultz, a college professor hired to correct factual inaccuracies in the book, remarked that \"This does not appear to be an authentic 'Fillmore' cartoon, although the authors of this book have captured accurately the strip's level of humor.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Show\" staff worked in another jab at the comic strip in \"Earth (The Book)\", where the strip \"Love Is...\" is referred to as \"a creepy cartoon that makes Mallard Fillmore look funny.\"\n\nOn January 4, 2005 a \"Mallard Fillmore\" strip was published featuring a television executive whom bloggers accused of being a Jewish caricature that promoted the anti-Semitic stereotype that \"Hollywood is run by Jews.\" While the main \"Mallard\" page only shows a week's worth of cartoons at a time, this cartoon is available on Jewish World Review's web site.\n\nThe strip's caricature of Jon Stewart, with a long, downwardly pointed nose, was criticized by Stewart's colleague satirist Stephen Colbert, who, during a December 14, 2006 show, joked that the caricature may have been \"clip art from \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\" Tinsley has since stated about Stewart that \"honestly, I didn't even know he was Jewish.\"\n\nTinsley found himself in trouble again in 2009 when he printed a strip mocking the idea of hate crimes right after the one-year anniversary of the violent murder of Ecuadorian immigrant Marcelo Lucero, which was ruled as a hate crime. This event sparked a protest where picketers gathered at the office of \"Newsday\", the Long Island-based paper that had run the strip in question. The protesters felt that the strip was in poor taste and disrespected the memory of the murder victim. Newsday later issued a statement, saying:\n\nTinsley himself wrote to \"Newsday\", causing further conflict when he defended his work:\n\n\"Newsday\" still runs \"Mallard Fillmore\" in its publication; following the \"New York Post\" move to discontinue its comics section it is the only paper in the New York City metropolitan area to carry it.\n\nIn 2004 Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman cited \"Mallard Fillmore\" as an example of misinformation. A strip showed a taxpayer attacking his TV set with a baseball bat and yelling: \"I can't afford to send my kids to college, or even take 'em out of their substandard public school, because the federal, state and local governments take more than 50 percent of my income in taxes. And then the guy on the news asks with a straight face whether or not we can 'afford' tax cuts.\"\n\nKrugman stated, \"Very few Americans pay as much as 50 percent of their income in taxes; on average, families near the middle of the income distribution pay only about half that percentage in federal, state and local taxes combined.\"\n\n"}

He played 75 games and scored 37 goals for Japan until 1987. He was known for his headers and was aptly nicknamed the \"Asian Nuclear Warhead\".\n\nHara retired from playing career in 1992 and began his new career as the coach of the youth team of his old club, which had been renamed by this point as Urawa Reds. In 1998 Hara became the manager of Urawa's top squad. Initially he saw success, with the team achieving a 3rd place finish for J.League's second stage in 1998. However, during J.League's first stage of 1999, the team finished 13th in the standings and Hara was released.\n\nFollowing his release from Urawa, Hara travelled to Spain to study the coaching methods applied by several La Liga clubs.

The Old Village (\"Altstadt\") centre of Zell am See is located on the western shore of deep Lake Zell, with the villages of Thumersbach to the east, Erlberg to the southeast, and Schüttdorf directly to the south.\n\nThe village of Zell am See comprises five cadastral communities:\n\nThe original Lake Zell reached somewhat further to the north and extended south to the Salzach river. The dimensions of the lake, however, have changed over time into marsh areas. The lake has the shape of a peanut, with an area of .\n\nThe mountains of the area form a horseshoe shape, the slopes are mainly forested or covered with Alpine pastures. The \"Hausberg\" (\"home mountain\") of Zell am See is the Schmittenhöhe, , which together with the adjacent Salzburg Slate Alps range in the west is part of the Greywacke zone between Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps. Mt. Schmittenhöhe is a popular centre for skiing and winter sports. The nearby Mt. Hundstein (\"Dog Stone\") at is the highest peak of the Salzburg Greywacke Zone.\n\nZell am See provides winter skiing on the above Schmittenhöhe mountain. The skiable area is approximately 138 km, including the pistes on the Kitzsteinhorn and Kaprun Maiskogel. The ski pass covers the whole area including transport to and from the glacier which is open most of the year, dependent on snowfall. Zell am See is a low-altitude ski area and snow cover can suffer from higher temperatures, but the glacier has snow cover most of the year.\n\nIn 2017 Zell am See announced a potential merger with Saalbach-Hinterglemm ski resort. In the 2019-2020 ski season the Zell am See Express 1 gondola was opened which allows access to the Zell am See Express 2 gondola at the base of piste 21 from Viehofen.\n\nNotable ski pistes in the resort include: The Trassabfahrt (14) which is the steepest piste in the region reaching an incline gradient of up to 75%, the Standardabfahrt (13) which is another valley run reaching an incline gradient of 60%, and the recently reopened Tannwaldabfahrt (21), a ski racing piste in the 1930s, and is well known for being consistently icy, and having a high steepness-width ratio in some sections of the piste.\n\nThe area of Zell am See was continuously populated at least since Roman times. About 740 AD, by order of Bishop Johannes (John) I of Salzburg, monks founded the village within the stem duchy of Bavaria, which was mentioned as \"Cella in Bisonzio\" in a 743 deed. The denotation \"Cella\" or German: \"Zelle\" refers to a monk's cell in the sense of a monastery, \"Bisonzio\" is the name of the Pinzgau region. Zell received the rights of a market town in 1357. During the German Peasants' War in 1526, the area was a site of heavy fighting against the troops of Swabian League. The Zell am See citizens had not participated in the uprising, nevertheless 200 years later, numerous Protestant inhabitants were expelled from Salzburg by order of Prince-Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian.\n\nFrom 1800, the town was occupied by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars. After the secularisation of the Salzburg Archbishopric, \"Zell am See\" finally passed to the Austrian Empire by resolution of the Vienna Congress in 1816. When in 1850 neighbouring Saalfelden became the capital of the Pinzgau district, the town's mayor successfully strived for relocating the administrative seat to Zell. The town's development was decisively promoted by the opening of the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line (\"Giselabahn\") on 30 July 1875, starting the annual summer tourism season. Zell am See received city rights on 24 January 24, 1928.\n\n\n\"(Source: Custos Cav. H. Scholz)\"\n\nSt Hippolyte's Church\n\nWithin St Hippolyte's Church are the oldest known building remnants of the Pinzgau region. The church is built in a mostly Romanesque style and consists of three naves. Before 1794, the central nave was crowned with a Gothic vault, but in that year it was replaced with another vault, which in turn was replaced by a flat wooden roof in 1898. Four steps lead up to the main altar, but the crypt has been filled in. The narthex and aisles are still Gothic, but some of the other Gothic objects (like the neogothic altars by Josef Bachlehner) were added during the renovation in 1898, when also the baroque furnishings of preceding centuries were removed.\n\nThe highpoint of the church is its elevated walkway with its ornate parapet, built in 1514. The walkway rests on four carved columns of precious marble, in between which an intricate net-vault is spun. The three pointed arches are crowned with crockets, and end in pointed towers. Between the arches are Gothic baldachins with cut-out figures of St Hippolyte and St Florian, originating from 1520.\n\nThe tower is the main focus of the Zell am See skyline. It has a height of . The strong walls have a limestone exterior.\n\nFrom 1660 until 1670, the main altar was replaced by a Baroque one, which was removed again in 1760. Almost none of the Baroque furnishings of the church remain apart from some adornments. Two Baroque statues ended up in the church of Prielau. Next to the main altar are two statues dating from 1480: St Rupert and St Vigilius. The side altar contains an image of the Virgin Mary from the now non-existent Church of Maria Wald, which dates from 1540. The left nave has a small altar dedicated to St Sebastian in its apsis.\n\nThe Grand Hotel Zell am See is situated in a unique position on a private peninsula right at the shore of Lake Zell, this large chalet is surrounded by water with a panoramic view of the mountains.\n\nThe Porsche family farm is located in Zell am See, having been obtained in 1939 by the senior Ferdinand Porsche in anticipation of the war. During the war, he transferred some of his business operations here and to Gmund, away from Stuttgart where, notwithstanding the heavy bombing, his son Ferry Porsche remained to oversee plant operations.\n\nIn Zell am See there are 3 elementary schools, one high school, one special school, one vocational school, one grammar school, one commercial academy and a commercial school:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He died as a member of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party.\n\nEarly life\n\nChief Fundikira attended his primary education at Tanga Primary School. He undertook middle school education at the same school and later joined Tabora School for secondary education where he graduated in 1939. The late Chief Fundikira joined Makerere University in Uganda from 1940 to 1946 and was conferred with a first degree in Agriculture. In 1957, he was ordained as chief of the Wanyamwezi in the Nyanyembe chiefdom. \n\nIn 1961 soon after independence, the first Chief Minister Julius Nyerere appointed Fundikira as minister for water, a portfolio he served for one year. He was appointed the first local justice minister when Tanganyika became a republic in 1962. He resigned from Cabinet in 1963 to protest the imminent legislation introducing a one party state.\n\nIn 1964, he resigned from the civil service. In 1967, he was appointed as board chairman of the defunct East African Airways until 1972 when his term of office came to an end. \n\nThe late Chief Fundikira continued running private business until 1990, when he spearheaded the debate on multipartism in Tanzania in collaboration with other politicians such as the late Kassanga Tumbo, Prince Bagenda, Mabere Marando, Ndimara Tegambwage, when they formed a national political reform committee (NCCR). \n\nIn 1993, soon after the birth of multiparty democracy in the country, Fundikira formed the UMD party and took part in the 1995 presidential election in which CCM emerged victorious, with Benjamin Mkapa being announced as the winner. \n\nHe held the party's top leadership post until 1999 when he crossed over to CCM. After the 2000 general elections, President Mkapa appointed him a nominated MP until 2005. He remained a CCM member until his death. \n\nAccording to the Wanyamwezi tradition, the burial of a chief should be conducted at night but, in this case, Chief Fundikira will be buried at 6.00pm just before sun set. \n\nFundikira: The long journey \n\nHe was among the first Ministers in the Uhuru cabinet, having served as Justice Minister. Fundikira hailed from a family of Nyamwezi chiefs but lost his title after founding President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere scrapped the chiefdoms set up in the country. \n\nHowever efforts were made by the Uhuru Government to incorporate tribal leaders, such as himself in the Government system. Such were gestures of goodwill meant to strengthen national unity above tribal inclinations. \n\nIn 1961, he became president of the East African Muslim Welfare Society, an organisation of a few Muslims, which sought better access to education. \n\nThe organisation was founded in 1945 by the Aga Khan with the aim of promoting Islam and raising the standard of living for East African Muslims. \n\nAs the country headed back towards the road to multi party politics, Fundikira played a pivotal role in organising the opposition by chairing the first interim structure of an opposition umbrella body under the name National Committee for Constitutional Reforms. \n\nHe later formed his own party, the Union for Multiparty Democracy, but latter shifted camp to the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi. \n\nIn 2005, Fundikira was nominated as Member of Parliament by former President Benjamin Mkapa along with a host of others, including Makongoro Nyerere and Anne Kilango of CCM.\n\nChief Abdallah Fundikira died on 6 August 2007 in his sleep.

{"id": "2186198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186198", "title": "Parc de la Villette", "text": "Parc de la Villette\n\nThe Parc de la Villette is the third-largest park in Paris, in area, located at the northeastern edge of the city in the 19th arrondissement. The park houses one of the largest concentration of cultural venues in Paris, including the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (City of Science and Industry, Europe's largest science museum), three major concert venues, and the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris.\n\nParc de la Villette is served by Paris Métro stations Corentin Cariou on Line 7 and Porte de Pantin on Line 5.\n\nThe park was designed by Bernard Tschumi, a French architect of Swiss origin, who built it from 1984 to 1987 in partnership with Colin Fournier, on the site of the huge Parisian \"abattoirs\" (slaughterhouses) and the national wholesale meat market, as part of an urban redevelopment project. The slaughterhouses, built in 1867 on the instructions of Napoléon III, had been cleared away and relocated in 1974. Tschumi won a major design competition in 1982–83 for the park, and he sought the opinions of the deconstructionist philosopher Jacques Derrida in the preparation of his design proposal.\n\nSince the creation of the park, museums, concert halls, and theatres have been designed by several noted contemporary architects, including Christian de Portzamparc, Adrien Fainsilber, Philippe Chaix, Jean-Paul Morel, Gérard Chamayou, on to Mr. Tschumi.\n\nThe park houses museums, concert halls, live performance stages, and theatres, as well as playgrounds for children, and thirty-five architectural follies. These include:\n\n\nLe TARMAC (former Théâtre de l'Est Parisien), venue for world performance art and dance companies touring from \"La Francophonie\", has moved to 159 avenue Gambetta in the 20th arrondissement.\n\nSince its completion in 1987, the Parc de la Villette has become a popular attraction for Paris residents and international travelers alike. An estimated 10 million people visit the park each year to take part in an array of cultural activities. With its collection of museums, theatres, architectural follies, themed gardens, and open spaces for exploration and activity, the park has created an area that relates to both adults and children.\n\nDesigned by Bernard Tschumi, the park is meant to be a place inspired by the post-modernist architectural ideas of deconstructivism. Tschumi's design was in partial response to the philosophies of Jacques Derrida, acting as an architectural experiment in space (through a reflection on Plato's Khôra), form, and how those relate a person's ability to recognize and interact. According to Tschumi, the intention of the park was to create space for activity and interaction, rather than adopt the conventional park mantra of ordered relaxation and self-indulgence. The vast expanse of the park allows for visitors to walk about the site with a sense of freedom and opportunity for exploration and discovery.\n\nThe design of the park is organized into a series of points, lines, and surfaces. These categories of spatial relation and formulation are used in Tschumi's design to act as a means of deconstructing the traditional views of how a park is conventionally meant to exist.\n\nThe Parc de la Villette boasts activities that engage all people of all ages and cultural backgrounds. The park is a contemporary melting pot of cultural expression where local artists and musicians produce exhibits and performances. On the periphery of the park lies the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, the largest science museum in Europe. There are a convention center and an I-MAX theatre. The park acts as a connection between these exterior functions. Concerts are scheduled year-round, hosting local and mainstream musicians. Dividing the park is the Canal de l'Ourcq, which has boat tours that transport visitors around the park and to other sites in Paris. Festivals are common in the park along with artist conventions and shows by performers.\n\nThe Parc de la Villette hosts an annual open-air film festival. In 2010 the festival's theme was \"To Be 20\" (\"Avoir 20 ans\") and featured films about youth and self-discovery around the age of 20. In 2010 films were shown by American filmmakers Woody Allen and Sofia Coppola as well as French and international filmmakers.\n\nThe Parc de la Villette has a collection of ten themed gardens that attract a large number of the park's visitors. Each garden is created with a different representation of architectural deconstructionism and tries to create space through playfully sculptural and clever means. While some of the gardens are minimalist in design, others are clearly constructed with children in mind.\n\nLe \"Jardin du Dragon\" (The Garden of the Dragon) is home to a large sculptural steel dragon that has an 80-foot slide for children to play on.\n\nThe \"Jardin de Bambou\" (Bamboo Garden) at the Parc de la Villette was designed by Alexandre Chemetoff, winner of the Grand Prix de l'urbanisme (2000).\n\nThe \"Jardin de la Treille\" (Trellis Garden) designed by Gilles Vexlard and Laurence Vacherot. Vines and creepers are going along a roof trellis and 90 small fountains designed so that you only really hear the murmur of them in between the grape vines. \n7 \"Sculptures de visées\" (Sculptures Bachelard) by Jean-Max Albert are installed all around and an anamorphosis reflection is displayed in a small pool.\n\nThe gardens range in function; where some gardens are meant for active engagement, others exist to play off of curiosity and investigation or merely allow for relaxation.\n\nProbably the most iconic pieces of the park, the follies act as architectural representations of deconstruction. In architecture, a folly (in French, \"folie\") is a building constructed primarily for decoration, but suggesting by its appearance some other purpose, or so extravagant that it transcends the normal range of garden ornaments or other class of building to which it belongs. Architecturally, the follies are meant to act as points of reference that help visitors gain a sense of direction and navigate throughout the space. Twenty-six follies, made of metal and painted bright red, are placed on a grid and offer a distinct organization to the park. Each is identified by a name and a code letter-number.\n\nArchitecturally, the follies are meant to act as points of reference that help visitors gain a sense of direction and navigate throughout the space. While the follies are meant to exist in a deconstructive vacuum without historical relation, many have found connections between the steel structures and the previous buildings that were part of the old industrial fabric of the area. Today, the follies remain as cues to organization and direction for park visitors. Some of them house restaurants, information centers, and other functions associated with the park's needs.\n\nThere have been many criticisms of the innovative design of the park since its original completion. To some, the park has little concern with the human scale of park functions and the vast open space seem to challenge the expectation that visitors may have of an urban park. Bernard Tschumi designed the Parc de la Villette with the intention of creating a space that exists in a vacuum, something without historical precedent. The park strives to strip down the signage and conventional representations that have infiltrated architectural design and allow for the existence of a “non-place.” This non-place, envisioned by Tschumi, is the most appropriate example of space and provides a truly honest relationship between the subject and the object.\n\nVisitors view and react to the plan, landscaping, and sculptural pieces without the ability to cross-reference them with previous works of historical architecture. The design of the park capitalizes on the innate qualities that are illustrated within architectural deconstructivism. By allowing visitors to experience the architecture of the park within this constructed vacuum, the time, recognitions, and activities that take place in that space begin to acquire a more vivid and authentic nature. The park is not acting as a spectacle; it is not an example of traditional park design such as New York City's Central Park. The Parc de la Villette strives to act as merely a frame for other cultural interaction.\n\nThe park embodies anti-tourism, not allowing visitors to breeze through the site and pick and choose the sites they want to see. Upon arrival in the park, visitors are thrust into a world that is not defined by conventional architectural relationships. The frame of the park, due to its roots in deconstructivism, tries to change and react to the functions that it holds within.\n\n"}

It is not very well researched yet, but generally assumed to be caused by a bacterial infection.\n\nNHP mainly affects the farmed shrimp species \"Litopenaeus vannamei\" (Pacific white shrimp) and \"Litopenaeus stylirostris\" (Western blue shrimp), but has also been reported in three other American species, namely \"Farfantepenaeus aztecus\", \"Farfantepenaeus californiensis\", and \"Litopenaeus setiferus\". The highest mortality rates occur in \"L. vannamei\", which is one of the two most frequently farmed species of shrimp. Untreated, the disease causes mortality rates of up to 90 percent within 30 days. A first outbreak of NHP had been reported in Texas in 1985; the disease then spread to shrimp aquacultures in South America.\n\nNHP is associated with a small, gram-negative, and highly pleomorphic \"Rickettsia\"-like bacterium that belongs to its own, new genus in the class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\nThe aetiological agent is the pathogenic agent Candidatus \"Hepatobacter penaei\", an obligate intracellular bacterium of the Order α-Proteobacteria. \n\nInfected shrimps show gross signs including soft shells and flaccid bodies, black or darkened gills, dark edges of the pleopods, and uropods, and an atrophied hepatopancreas that is whitish instead of orange or tan as is usual.\n\nThe pathogen that causes NHP seems to prefer high water temperatures (above ) and elevated levels of salinity (more than 20–38 ppt).

Close to Nikita Mikhailovich Muravyov in his views, he was declared the group's leader on the eve of the December 26 uprising in 1825 but failed to appear, and instead sought refuge in the Austrian embassy.\n\nTrubetskoy was born in the noble Trubetskoy family. His father was Prince Pyotr Sergeyevich Troubetzkoy (1760–1817). His mother, Daria (d. 1796), was a daughter of the Georgian prince Alexander Bakarovich Gruzinsky.\n\nTroubetzkoy received home education, since 1806 he was attending lectures in the Moscow University. In 1808 he entered Leib Guards Semyonovsky regiment. As a soldier, he participated in all significant battles of Sixth Coalition campaign in 1812-1814 including battle of Borodino, battle of Maloyaroslavets, Battle of Lützen, battle of Bautzen and battle of Kulm and received many orders. In the battle of Leipzig he was badly wounded. After the war he continued military service and in 1821 he was promoted to Colonel.\n\nAfter the war Trubetskoy became a Freemason, a member of the Lodge of the Three Virtues. He was among the founders of the first proto-Decembrists societies - the Union of Salvation (1816) and later the Union of Prosperity (1819). The two unions were largely based on freemasonry. They sought gradual improvement of the Russian Empire, but hadn't adopted some goals the Decembrists did later: complete abolition of serfdom, introduction of constitution and constitutionally secured liberties, abolition of privileges of upper estates of the realm. In 1819 Trubetskoy went abroad for treatment. When he returned in 1821 he found the Union had ceased to exist. Trubetskoy was one of the founders and leaders of the Northern Society. Trubestkoy advocated Constitutional monarchy, but other Decembrists desired revolution, to execute the tsar and establish a republic (e.g. Ryleev and Pestel). He was elected \"dictator\" but did not come to Senate Square, most probably because he expected the revolt to fail.\n\nHe was arrested the next day at the apartments of Count Ludwig Lebzeltern, his brother-in-law and the Austrian Empire's minister to St. Petersburg.\n\nTrubetskoy was sentenced to death but the sentence was changed to katorga for life in Nerchinsk coal mines. Trubetskoy's wife Ekaterina Laval (a rich heiress of Ekaterina Kozitskaya's fortune) went to exile with him. Her feat (she voluntarily renounced all wealth and privileges and subjected herself to hard life in katorga) was subject of a famous poem by Nekrasov. In 1839 his family was allowed to live in exile in Irkutsk, and he eventually also received permission. In 1854 his wife died. In 1856 he along with other survived Decembrists was granted amnesty, his children were given their titles, and he was able to return to Russia.

He succeeded Palnatoke as the leaders of the Jomsvikings in the late 10th century. The character of Sigvaldi remains largely enigmatic. As a leader, he was said to be more wily than brave despite leading such a powerful force.\n\nSigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson was the son of Jarl Strut-Harald, who ruled over the Danish territory of Scania and the brother of Thorkell the Tall.\n\nIn order to win Astrid, the daughter of the Wendish chieftain Burislav, he promised to liberate the Wends of the tribute they had to pay to the Danes. He fulfilled his promise by sailing to Zealand where he sent the message to King Sweyn Forkbeard that he had important tidings, but had fallen ill and could not come in person to bring them to him. When Sweyn went aboard Sigvaldi's ship, he was captured by the Jomsvikings. To be liberated, the Danish king had to agree to grant independence to both the Jomsvikings and to the Wends, in addition to paying a king's ransom. In further negotiations, it was agreed that Sweyn would marry Gunhild of Wenden, the daughter of Burislav, while Burislav would marry Sweyn's sister Tyri. \nAt the time of the funeral of his father, Strut-Harald, Sigvaldi was advised by Sweyn to join the attack on Norway to depose Haakon Sigurdsson. This promise would lead to the defeat of Jomsvikings at the Battle of Hjörungavágr in 986, from which Sigvaldi fled with disgrace.\n\nIn 1000, Sigvaldi proved to be treacherous at the Battle of Svolder by luring Olaf Tryggvason to the battle. According to Snorri Sturluson in \"Heimskringla\", Sigvaldi arrived to tell him rumors of a planned ambush were false. He led him into an ambush and deserted him in the heat of battle. There is no record of Sigvaldi after the Battle of Svolder. The invasion of England in 1009 by his brother Thorkell the Tall was allegedly intended to avenge Sigvaldi's death, so it is possible Sigvald met his end in England.\n\n\n"}

Annabella's chance to enter films came when her father entertained a film producer, who gave her a small part in Abel Gance's great classic \"Napoléon\" (1927). She was not critically acclaimed until she starred in René Clair's \"Le Million\" (1931), and over the following decade established herself as one of France's most popular cinema actresses. For \"Veille d'armes\" (1935), she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1936.\n\nShe was cast as the female lead in the British-made film \"Wings of the Morning\" (1937) with Henry Fonda. Under contract to 20th Century Fox, she traveled to America and appeared in \"Suez\" (1938) with Loretta Young and Tyrone Power. Her romance with Power was widely reported by movie magazines of the day. Darryl F. Zanuck, movie mogul at 20th Century Fox, did not want his matinee idol married. He offered Annabella a multi-movie deal that would take her overseas. She refused to leave Power, and on completion of \"Suez\", she returned to France to obtain a divorce from her then-husband, Jean Murat. Power and she married on 23 April 1939. The two honeymooned in Rome. Within a few months, Annabella and Power had again flown to Europe to bring Annabella's mother back to live in their home, while her father and brother stayed behind. Her brother was ultimately shot and killed by the Nazis. Annabella made a return trip to bring her daughter, Anne, back from France to live with them. Power adopted Anne before leaving for service in the United States Marine Corps in August 1942. Anne Power later married actor Oskar Werner.\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck, angry with her for marrying his top box-office star, did not cast her in movies despite Annabella's contract with 20th Century-Fox. Annabella was also not lent to other studios. Power and she appeared together in the play \"Liliom\" in New Haven, Connecticut. While Power was away during his war service, Annabella appeared in \"Blithe Spirit\" in Chicago. On Broadway, she received excellent notices for her work in the play \"Jacobowsky and the Colonel\", directed by Elia Kazan, in 1944. Annabella also embarked on an affair with author Roald Dahl; she had refused to give Power a divorce to marry Judy Garland, and her marriage was strained. Dahl told his wife, Liccy, that it was an intense and passionate relationship, during which Dahl learned a lot about sex from the actress.\n\nWhen Power returned from the war, the couple decided to try to make their marriage work once again.\nAnnabella again worked in films, playing the female lead in \"[[13 Rue Madeleine]]\" (1947) with [[James Cagney]]. Power and she finally divorced in 1948, and Annabella returned to France. She appeared in film director [[José Luis Sáenz de Heredia]]'s Spanish version of \"[[Don Juan (1950 film)|Don Juan]]\" (1950), and her final film was released in 1952. After a 1954 television appearance in the American series \"[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]\", she retired.\n\nAnnabella and Tyrone Power remained very close, and after his divorce from [[Linda Christian]], he attempted to reconcile with her, confessing that in giving her up, he had made a terrible mistake. However, Annabella refused. Power informed her that he would not take the elevator to leave her apartment, but the stairs, in case she changed her mind and called him back. She did not.\n\nAnnabella died in 1996 after suffering a heart attack in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France, aged 89, and was interred in Passy Cemetery in Haute-Savoie (France).\n\n\n[[Category:1907 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Val-de-Marne]]\n[[Category:French film actresses]]\n[[Category:French silent film actresses]]\n[[Category:Burials at Passy Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Volpi Cup for Best Actress winners]]\n[[Category:Volpi Cup winners]]\n[[Category:20th-century French actresses]]\n[[Category:Power family]]\n[[Category:French expatriate actresses in the United States]]"}

The manager Hiromi Hara made him a regular and assigned a more attacking role. His club won the 2004 J.League Cup by beating Urawa Reds in the final which ended 0–0 after the extra time. The penalty shoot-out was required and his successful conversion as the last penalty taker for Tokyo finally broke the deadlock.\n\nHe was transferred to Gamba Osaka at the beginning of the 2006 season and scored in the beginning league match against Urawa Reds.

Shortly after, Vickers acquired the British patents. Welin breech blocks provide obturation for artillery pieces which use separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. In this system the projectile is loaded first and then followed by cloth bags of propellant. \n\nThe breech block incorporated a screw design with multiple \"steps\" of threads of progressively increasing radius, each step occupying the same circular sector.\n\nEach step engaged with its matching thread cut in the gun breech when inserted and rotated. A gap in the thread steps was still necessary for the insertion of the largest step before rotation, so the area of the breech secured by threads in the block is:\n\nThis was a major improvement on previous non-stepped designs such as the de Bange system, which had only a single thread step and hence only half of the block's circumference had a thread which engaged with the breech, necessitating a fairly long screw to achieve a secure lock. The much greater threaded area of the Welin block allowed it to be shorter, allowing faster opening as it could be swung down or to the side after being withdrawn a much shorter distance than previous designs. It was also simpler and more secure. \nThe Welin breech was a single motion screw, allowing it to be operated much faster than previous interrupted-thread breeches, and it became very common on British and American large calibre naval artillery and also field artillery above about 4.5 inches (114 mm).\n\nThough the US Navy was offered the design a year or two after its invention, they declined and the American Bethlehem Steel spent the next five years in trying to circumvent Welin's patent, before having to buy it through Vickers.\n\n\n"}

He was christened on 19 January 1740 in St James's Church, Piccadilly, in Westminster. He attended Trinity College, Oxford.\n\nIn 1763 he was in Italy with John Fitzpatrick. In 1774 he lived in Muswell Hill, north London.\n\nOn 12 March 1768 he married Diana (1734-1808), former Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Charlotte. She was born into the Spencer family as the daughter of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough and the Honourable Elizabeth Trevor. Diana had married in 1757 as her first husband Frederick St John, 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke. This marriage, which gave her two sons, was unhappy and her husband was notoriously unfaithful. In February 1768 he petitioned for divorce on grounds of adultery (\"criminal conversation\"). The petition required an act of parliament, which was passed the next month. Soon thereafter she married Beauclerk.\n\nThey had four children together:\nFrom 1772-1776 he lived at 3 Adelphi Terrace. Beauclerk died at his house in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury on 11 March 1780. Lady Diana later sold the house to retire in reduced circumstances to Richmond. The house at Great Russell Street, which was partly demolished in 1788, housed a library designed by Robert Adam.\n\nTopham Beauclerk entertained Dr Johnson at his home in Old Windsor for a number of weeks. He appears several times in James Boswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\". As Bennet Langton records: \"His affection for Topham Beauclerk was so great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that severe illness which at last occasioned his death, Johnson said (with a voice faultering with emotion), 'Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save Beauclerk'.\" (Boswell 1672).\n\nHe was an intimate friend also of Horace Walpole. The artist Joseph Farington records Walpole's description of him:\n\nLord Orford mentioned many particulars relative to the late Mr. Topham Beauclerc. He said He was the worst tempered man He ever knew. Lady Di passed a most miserable life with him. Lord O, out of regard to her invited them occasionally to pass a few days at Strawberry Hill. They slept in separate beds. Beauclerc was remarkably filthy in his person which generated vermin. He took Laudanum regularly in vast quantities. He seldom rose before one or two o'clock. His principal delight was in disputing on subjects that occurred, this He did accutely. Before He died He asked pardon of Lady Di, for his ill usage of her. He had one son and two daughters by Lady Di. One married Lord Herbert, the second went abroad with her Brother, Lord Bolingbroke [i.e. George St John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke].\n\n\n"}

It runs through parts of the Portsoken and Bishopsgate Without wards of the City of London, the historic nucleus and modern financial centre of London. It marks the route of an old ditch that ran outside a part of the London Wall, renowned for being used as a site for disposing of waste and, particularly, deceased dogs.\n\nThe road forms part of the A1211 route from Barbican to Whitechapel. Traffic continues onto Houndsditch from Outwich Street, a short section of road behind the Heron Tower, and then enters St. Botolph Street at the south-eastern end of Houndsditch. From there, traffic may turn left onto Whitechapel High Street or right onto Aldgate High Street.\n\nA ditch was dug outside Londinium's defensive wall by the Romans but was subsequently filled in and obliterated. The Danes under Cnut the Great constructed a town ditch to control access to the city. The ditch was redug in 1211 as a part of the defences, and was about in width. The city authorities found it a continual problem to scour and clean as many adjacent houses found it a convenient place to dispose of filth and refuse. In 1595, levelling was first considered, although the street running alongside the ditch had first been paved in 1503. The name \"Houndsditche\" appears in the 13th century, and seems to relate to the quantity of rubbish and dead dogs thrown into it; previously it seems to have been referred to only by the appellation \"the Ditch\". Several dogs' skeletons were unearthed at Houndsditch in 1989.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the street had become a thriving market in clothing and novelties, giving rise to one of London's leading department stores, the Houndsditch Warehouse, dubbed the \"Selfridges of the Jewish Quarter\".\n\nIn December 1910, anarchists killed three police officers who had interrupted them during an attempted burglary at a jeweller's shop at No. 119, Houndsditch. In January 1911, two of the gang were cornered and killed in the Siege of Sidney Street.\n\nApproaching Bishopsgate, the modern office blocks do not occupy the full building plots, leaving some small areas empty. These were historically the sites of Plague pits.\n\nTraffic flows one-way south-eastward from Outwich Street down the modern Houndsditch, which continues onto St. Botolph Street, connecting to either Aldgate High Street (west) or Whitechapel High Street (east). The street is the location of a number of restaurants, bars and offices, and a short pedestrianised section of it runs along the north side of the Heron Tower, the tallest building in the City of London.\n\nThe nearest London Underground station is Aldgate and the closest mainline railway station is Liverpool Street. The street is served by London Buses routes 42, 78, 100, 135, and 205.\n\nHoundsditch is the location of the 1945 film \"Kitty\". It is described as a slum, set in 1783. \n"}

{"id": "2186340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186340", "title": "Achilles tendon rupture", "text": "Achilles tendon rupture\n\nAchilles tendon rupture is when the Achilles tendon, at the back of the ankle, breaks. Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult.\nRupture typically occurs as a result of a sudden bending up of the foot when the calf muscle is engaged, direct trauma, or long-standing tendonitis. Other risk factors include the use of fluoroquinolones, a significant change in exercise, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or corticosteroid use. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination and supported by medical imaging.\nPrevention may include stretching before activity. Treatment may be by surgery repair or casting with the toes somewhat pointed down. Relatively rapid return to weight bearing (within 4 weeks) appears okay. While surgery traditionally results in a small decrease in the risk of re-rupture, the risk of other complications is greater. Additionally rapid rehabilitation may remove this difference in ruptures. If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes are not as good.\nAchilles tendon rupture occurs in about 1 per 10,000 people per year. Males are more commonly affected than females. People in their 30s to 50s are most commonly affected. The tendon itself was named in 1693 after the Greek hero Achilles.\n\nThe main symptom is typically the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking then becomes difficult.\n\nThe Achilles tendon is most commonly injured by sudden plantarflexion or dorsiflexion of the ankle, or by forced dorsiflexion of the ankle outside its normal range of motion.\n\nOther mechanisms by which the Achilles can be torn involve sudden direct trauma to the tendon, or sudden activation of the Achilles after atrophy from prolonged periods of inactivity. Some other common tears can occur from overuse while participating in intense sports. Twisting or jerking motions can also contribute to injury.\n\nFluoroquinolone antibiotics, famously ciprofloxacin, are known to increase the risk of tendon rupture, particularly Achilles.\n\nPeople who commonly fall victim to Achilles rupture or tear include recreational athletes, people of old age, individuals with previous Achilles tendon tears or ruptures, previous tendon injections or quinolone use, extreme changes in training intensity or activity level, and participation in a new activity.\n\nMost cases of Achilles tendon rupture are traumatic sports injuries. The average age of patients is 29–40 years with a male-to-female ratio of nearly 20:1. Direct steroid injections into the tendon have also been linked to rupture.\n\nThe use of quinolone antibiotics can cause several forms of tendinitis and tendon rupture, including rupture of the Achilles tendon. The risk is higher in people who are older than 60, who are also taking corticosteroids, or have kidney disease; it also increases with dose and taking them for longer periods of time. As of 2016 the mechanism through which quinolones cause this, was unclear.\n\nThe Achilles tendon is the strongest and thickest tendon in the body, connecting the gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris to the calcaneus. It is approximately 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) long and begins near the middle portion of the calf. Contraction of the gastrosoleus plantar flexes the foot, enabling such activities as walking, jumping, and running. The Achilles tendon receives its blood supply from its musculotendinous junction with the triceps surae and its innervation from the sural nerve and to a lesser degree from the tibial nerve.\n\nDiagnosis may be based on symptoms and the history of the event; typically people say it feels like being kicked or shot behind the ankle. Upon examination a gap may be felt just above the heel unless swelling has filled the gap and the Simmonds' test (aka Thompson test) will be positive; squeezing the calf muscles of the affected side while the person lies on their stomach, face down, with his feet hanging loose results in no movement (no passive plantarflexion) of the foot, while movement is expected with an intact Achilles tendon and should be observable upon manipulation of the uninvolved calf. Walking will usually be severely impaired, as the person will be unable to step off the ground using the injured leg. The person will also be unable to stand up on the toes of that leg, and pointing the foot downward (plantarflexion) will be impaired. Pain may be severe, and swelling is common.\n\nSometimes an ultrasound scan may be required to clarify or confirm the diagnosis and is recommended over MRI. MRI is generally not needed.\n\nMusculoskeletal ultrasonography can be used to determine the tendon thickness, character, and presence of a tear. It works by sending extremely high frequencies of sound through the body. Some of these sounds are reflected back off the spaces between interstitial fluid and soft tissue or bone. These reflected images can be analyzed and computed into an image. These images are captured in real time and can be very helpful in detecting movement of the tendon and visualising possible injuries or tears. This device makes it very easy to spot structural damages to soft tissues, and consistent method of detecting this type of injury. This imaging modality is inexpensive, involves no ionizing radiation and, in the hands of skilled ultrasonographers, may be very reliable.\n\nMRI can be used to discern incomplete ruptures from degeneration of the Achilles tendon, and MRI can also distinguish between paratenonitis, tendinosis, and bursitis. This technique uses a strong uniform magnetic field to align millions of protons running through the body. These protons are then bombarded with radio waves that knock some of them out of alignment. When these protons return they emit their own unique radio waves that can be analysed by a computer in 3D to create sharp cross sectional image of the area of interest. MRI can provide unparalleled contrast in soft tissue for an extremely high quality photograph making it easy for technicians to spot tears and other injuries.\n\nRadiography can also be used to indirectly identify Achilles tears. Radiography uses X-rays to analyse the point of injury. This is not very effective at identifying injuries to soft tissue. X-rays are created when high energy electrons hit a metal source. X-ray images are acquired by utilising the different attenuation characteristics of dense (e.g. calcium in bone) and less dense (e.g. muscle) tissues when these rays pass through tissue and are captured on film. X-rays are generally exposed to optimise visualisation of dense objects such as bone while soft tissue remains relatively undifferentiated in the background. Radiography has little role in assessment of Achilles' tendon injury and is more useful for ruling out other injuries such as calcaneal fractures.\n\nTreatment options include surgical and non-surgical approaches. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture however it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery.\n\nIn centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates.\n\nThere are two different types of surgeries; open surgery and percutaneous surgery.\n\nDuring an open surgery an incision is made in the back of the leg and the Achilles tendon is stitched together. In a complete or serious rupture the tendon of plantaris or another vestigial muscle is harvested and wrapped around the Achilles tendon, increasing the strength of the repaired tendon. If the tissue quality is poor, e.g. the injury has been neglected, the surgeon might use a reinforcement mesh (collagen, Artelon or other degradable material).\n\nIn percutaneous surgery, the surgeon makes several small incisions, rather than one large incision, and sews the tendon back together through the incision(s). Surgery may be delayed for about a week after the rupture to let the swelling go down. For sedentary patients and those who have vasculopathy or risks for poor healing, percutaneous surgical repair may be a better treatment choice than open surgical repair.\n\nNon-surgical treatment used to involve very long periods in a series of casts, and took longer to complete than surgical treatment. But both surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation protocols have recently become quicker, shorter, more aggressive, and more successful. It used to be that patients who underwent surgery would wear a cast for approximately 4 to 8 weeks after surgery and were only allowed to gently move the ankle once out of the cast. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. To keep their ankle safe these patients use a removable boot while walking and doing daily activities. Modern studies including non-surgical patients generally limit non-weight-bearing (NWB) to two weeks, and use modern removable boots, either fixed or hinged, rather than casts. Physiotherapy is often begun as early as two weeks following the start of either kind of treatment.\n\nThere are three things that need to be kept in mind while rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles: range of motion, functional strength, and sometimes orthotic support. Range of motion is important because it takes into mind the tightness of the repaired tendon. When beginning rehab a patient should perform stretches lightly and increase the intensity as time and pain permits. Putting linear stress on the tendon is important because it stimulates connective tissue repair, which can be achieved while performing the “runners stretch,” (putting your toes a couple inches up the wall while your heel is on the ground). Doing stretches to gain functional strength are also important because it improves healing in the tendon, which will in turn lead to a quicker return to activities. These stretches should be more intense and should involve some sort of weight bearing, which helps reorient and strengthen the collagen fibers in the injured ankle. A popular stretch used for this phase of rehabilitation is the toe raise on an elevated surface. The patient is to push up onto the toes and lower his or her self as far down as possible and repeat several times. The other part of the rehab process is orthotic support. This doesn’t have anything to do with stretching or strengthening the tendon, rather it is in place to keep the patient comfortable. These are custom made inserts that fit into the patients shoe and help with proper pronation of the foot, which is otherwise a problem that can lead to problems with the Achilles.\n\nTo briefly summarize the steps of rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles tendon, you should begin with range of motion type stretching. This will allow the ankle to get used to moving again and get ready for weight bearing activities. Then there is functional strength, this is where weight bearing should begin in order to start strengthening the tendon and getting it ready to perform daily activities and eventually in athletic situations.\n\n"}

It was the brain-child of Dr. Condon, H.S. Reid and others under the patronage of the Rt. Rev. Robert Milman, DD, the seventh Metropolitan of India. The idea took shape as the Nainital Diocesan Boys' High School, as Sherwood was once called. Sherwood's sister school, erstwhile known as Diocesan Girls' High School, branched into All Saints' College, Nainital. \n\nAppeals to the public for funds were overwhelming, and a mixed school under Miss Bradbury was started at Petersfield. Its success was reflected in the large-scale rejection of applications for admission. The direct outcome of this pressure was to separate the girls from boys, the latter shifting to Stoneleigh near the Ramsay Hospital.\n\nAccording to E. Atkinson's \"The Himalayan Gazetteer\" of 1882:\n\"In 1872 the number of pupils increased to 100, but still many applications were refused in consequence of the want of accommodation: The Committee then appealed to the general public for aid in erecting proper school buildings and met with generous response... In 1873 the Sherwood estate with house and magnificent grounds was purchased by the committee for the boys school and is perhaps the finest site and establishment of its kind in India. The report of the examiners show that both in the internal economy and in the character of the instruction imparted, the Diocesan schools thoroughly fulfill the designs of their founder's.\"\n\nThe school received notice to quit Sherwood so that a new Government House might be built. Accommodation was provided temporarily at Barnsdale near the present-day Secretariat. It was later decided to move the school to the 'health resort' of Khurpatal. Three houses on Alma hill — Tonnochy, Snow View and St. Cloud — served as temporary accommodation.\n\nLand on a spur of Ayarpatta was acquired in 1897 and the foundation stone laid by Alfred, Lord Bishop of Lucknow, on 5 June. From that day, 5 June has been reckoned as Founder's Day.\n\nIn 1918 the school was divided into four houses:\n\nIn 1922 electricity came to Sherwood, and on 15 June of the same year the infirmary was dedicated and sanctified.\n\nThe Horsman brothers, both old Sherwoodians, donated Rs. 75,000/- for the construction of the junior wing known as Horsman Wing, completed in 1927.\n\nIn 1937, the name of the school was changed from the Diocesan Boys' School to Sherwood College, although to this day it is known to the coolies as 'Malla Di-shen,' translated presumably as 'Upper Diocesan'.\n\nThe Binns block was built on the northern side of the back quad; in the following year, Milman Hall was constructed. The new building was formally opened by Sir Harry Haig, Governor of the U.P. It now accommodates a school hall with a seating capacity of 600 and a gymnasium below.\n\nThe college chapel, originally dedicated on 1 October 1913, was re-dedicated to St. Barnabas, the Apostle of Learning, on 5 June 1937. A stained-glass window depicting the Good Shepherd was erected on the school's Diamond Jubilee in 1929. The Hammond electric organ was installed in 1939. On Founder's Day, 5 June 1940, a teak altar and altar rails were dedicated to the memory of 'Old Tom' Taylor, a member of the college from 1884 to 1932. The following winter, the wooden paneling of 'shisham' was placed around the chapel and dedicated on Founder's Day 1941. In the same year at the Annual Confirmation Service the teak door was dedicated.\n\nIn 1947, the Old Sherwoodians Society had a plaque fabricated bearing the legend 'Sacred to the memory of Old Sherwoodians who made the Supreme Sacrifice in World War II', which lists the names of those who fell in action. Another roll of honour bearing the names of those who were in active service in World War II hangs in Milman Hall.\n\nBy 1948, independence had come to India and changes needed to be made. With the exodus of British families, numbers had dropped to a level hardly sufficient to sustain the establishment, but by 1957 the school had approximately 370 boys on its rolls. Additions were made, including an upper floor which was added to the infirmary, and the foundation-stone of the study block (now called Llewelyn Block, the top floor of which has since been demolished to provide an unrestricted view of the plains) was laid. A swimming pool was built.\n\nIn 1973, D.R.A. Mountford assumed headship. Between 1973 and 2003 a phased programme of renovation and construction was enacted. The school switched over to the 10+2 pattern under the Indian School Certificate in 1975, when the first batch appeared for the ICSE (class 10) examination. This was the year the last batch of ISC (year 11) appeared for the board examination. The first batch of ISC-12 appeared for the board examination in March 1978.\n\nTwo recent innovations have been the introduction of a Computer Literacy program for all students in classes 6 to 12 and the introduction of co-education at the Plus-2 stage.\n\nThe school's motto, in Latin, is \"Mereat Quisque Palmam\", meaning \"Let each one merit his prize\".\n\nSherwood was named after the Sherwood Foresters, and the school flag borrowed from their colours: bottle green, maroon and white. The houses are Allen-a-Dale or AD (red), Robin Hood or RH (green), Friar Tuck or FT (blue), and Little John or LJ (yellow), all named after Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Among the recent additions is the purple banner of the girls (Maid Marian).\n\nThe school is on a large, sprawling campus on the Ayarpata hill (one among the seven hills that boundary Nainital Lake). The school is divided into two parts: Dixon Wing (grades 7-12) and Horsman Wing (grades 3-6). There are separate dormitories for the students of both wings. The girls' dormitories are with the new teachers' residences, a little away from the main campus.\n\nIt has a well-equipped library with a large collection. The library subscribes to the latest magazines and journals. A computer laboratory and a separate internet laboratory with a VSAT link serve as the school's computer facilities.\n\nIt is mandatory for all students to participate in sports and extracurricular cultural activities, such as theater, music (Indian and Western), fine arts, elocution, debating, and bi-annual group excursions out of town.\n\nSherwood has football and cricket teams. The school is equipped with tennis, basketball, squash, and indoor badminton courts, as well as a swimming pool built by the students in 1954 and a large playground that doubles as sports field and venue for the annual school fête. The school's soccer team has won the \"Mayo Cup\" many times over.\n\nThe students of grades 3-6 have art and craft lessons in their daily schedule. The Dixon Wing, i.e., grades 7-12, have to opt for a SUPW and another activity as pursuit.\n\nThe Art Block houses the Indian and Western music departments on the ground floor. The school has its own band. The first floor contains the Art department where the varieties range from crafts like batik and pottery to oil canvas painting. For the photo enthusiasts there is a Photography Club. For the great writers of tomorrow there is a Hindi Literary Society as well as an English Literary Society. The school has two dramatics societies: Senior Dramatics Society (for the Dixies) and Junior Dramatics Society (for the Horsies). On basis of their evaluation in co-curricular activities, the houses are awarded the Co-Curricular Activities Cup at the Founders Prize ceremony.\n\nThe chapel (dedicated to Saint Barnabas) is on the front quad (or quadrangle), with views of the Kumaon hills descending into the \"Terai\" (the plains).\n\nApproximately 300 alumni were on Active Service in World Wars 1 and 2:\n\n"}

They rest concealed among the foliage, and can fly rather fast and without interruption. They visit flowers, particularly umbellifers, and have also been observed at bait. They are plentiful wherever they occur, being very abundant in some years. In opposition to other observers I have sometimes seen 3 or 4 males resting together on a leaf.\n\n\nA little butterfly that is found along hedges, scrub, and wood edges but is often overlooked since it spends much of its time high in the tree canopy. Like the purple emperor this butterfly uses 'master trees', usually European ash (\"Fraxinus excelsior\"). Males and unmated females congregate at the tops of isolated trees. Once mated the female descends to lower levels to begin laying her eggs. Males rarely descend and both feed mainly on honeydew. Both sexes are dark brown on the upperside with orange tails. The female also has a bright orange band across both forewings. The undersides are similar in both sexes and are bright orange with two white streaks.\n\nIn Europe the female lays her eggs on blackthorn (\"Prunus spinosa\") in late August which overwinter, hatching the following spring when the buds are breaking. It has been found that the best way to find breeding sites for this species is to look for the conspicuous white eggs in the winter. The larvae are extremely well camouflaged and feed only at night, remaining motionless during the day. Pupation takes place in leaf litter on the ground in late June or early July and are attractive to ants who will bury them in shallow cells.\n\n\n\n"}

The larva, which is already developed in the sunmier, does not leave the egg before April; it bores into the young shoots and later lies on the young leaves, especially on those of the lower twigs of old oak-trees. It is a dreadful cannibal and is evidently avoided by insect-eating birds, as it has been\nfound unmolested in the nest of the blue tit containing young birds (Bingham-Newland). On the other hand it is much infested with ichneumons, as well as a species of \"Tachina\", which develops after the pupation of the caterpillar (Steinfert). Adult yellowish brown with a reddish tint, on the back a row of triangles connected by a dark line, the sides greenish. On various species of oak, and said to occur also on other plants (\"Myrica\", etc.); adult in July. The pupa rounded, brown, irregularly spotted with blackish,on the back three rows of dark spots. The butterflies occur from June till August everywhere in the plains and hills, but usually singly, in certain years more plentifully. They rest on the outer twigs of oak-bushes with the wings always closed, but sometimes flutter high up about the crowns of old oaks.\nThis active little butterfly is most often seen fluttering around high up in oak trees on warm sunny July and early August days. Males have a glossy purple sheen on the upperside, females have two patches on the forewing only. The underside is light grey with a white streak, edged in black, running down the middle of both wings. The hindwings have a short tail with two orange spots at the base on the underside. It is common and widespread across southern and central England and Wales, becoming rarer and more isolated in the north as far as central Scotland. In Ireland it occurs in a few isolated colonies scattered across the country but is probably still under recorded due to its reclusive habits. Males tend to stay high up in trees, females come down to lower levels to lay eggs. Both sexes feed mainly on honeydew although females are occasionally attracted to flowers whilst taking a break from egg laying.\n\nEggs are laid singly at the base of oak buds in late summer ready to hatch the following spring as the buds break. Both sessile oak \"Quercus petraea\" and pedunculate oak \"Quercus robur\", Britain's two native oaks are used and also some introduced species such as Turkey oak \"Quercus cerris\" and evergreen oak \"Quercus ilex\". In winter the eggs are easily found on close examination of bare branches. The caterpillar is fully developed inside the egg after two or three weeks but doesn't hatch until the spring whereupon it burrows into the flower buds to feed safely concealed. As it gets larger and the buds open it spins a silken retreat and feeds only at night. Pupation usually takes place in the leaf litter where it is tended by ants who bury them, but also sometimes in a crevice in the bark of the foodplant. There is one brood a year with adults on the wing in July and August.\n\n\n"}

The series itself is no longer contested, but the title lives on, with the winner of the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship awarded the trophy and title of Australian Touring Car Champion.\n\nThe first Australian Touring Car Championship was held in 1960 as a single race for Appendix J Touring Cars. This was an acknowledgement of the rising popularity of races held for passenger sedans as opposed to those for purpose built open wheel racing cars, or sports cars. The race was held at the Gnoo Blas Motor Racing Circuit in Orange in rural New South Wales, west of Sydney. It was won by journalist racer, David McKay driving a Jaguar 3.4 Litre prepared by his own racing team, which to this point had been better known for its preparation of open-wheel and sports racing cars.\n\nThe early years of the ATCC saw the once a year event visit mostly rural circuits, before finally visiting a major city circuit, Lakeside Raceway on the outskirts of Brisbane in 1964. This race was also the first not won by a Jaguar with Ian Geoghegan driving a Ford Cortina GT winning the first of his five titles. From 1965 the title would largely be won by an American V8 powered muscle car, most notably the Ford Mustang which would be used to win five consecutive titles in 1965 (Norm Beechey) and 1966–69 (Geoghegan). The first championship victory by the driver of an Australian car was that of Beechey in 1970 driving a Holden HT Monaro GTS350. As of 4 December, 2011 Jamie Whincup & Norm Beechey are the only two people to have won the championship in both a Ford and a Holden. The 1971 and 1972 championships were won by 1962 and 1963 champion Bob Jane who drove a 7.0 litre Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1 in 1971 before CAMS rule changes forced Jane to use the smaller 5.7 litres 350 Chevrolet in the Camaro in 1972.\n\nA major shift occurred in 1973. The championship had grown from a single race into a multi-event series in 1969, but the competition had not changed markedly. The 'Supercar scare' that had rocked the buildup to 1972 Bathurst 500 forced sweeping changes through touring car regulations. The Improved Touring Car regulations which governed the ATCC, known at the time as Group C were amalgamated with the more basic Group E Series Production Touring Cars regulations which governed the Bathurst touring car endurance race in a compromise between the two, creating a single class for touring car racing that would hold sway of Australian Touring Car racing until the introduction of Group A in 1985.\n\nThis period saw a rise in the tribal style conflicts between Holden and Ford and in particular the two marques leading drivers, respectively Peter Brock and Allan Moffat who between them would claim seven of the eras 12 championships (and nine of the associated Bathurst victories). By the mid-1980s Group C had become wracked with infighting and almost random parity adjustments between competing marques.\n\nAttention focussed purely on Holden and Ford had blurred as European and Japanese manufacturers joined the Australian agents of the two big American companies, the trend starting in 1981 with BMW, Mazda and Nissan. The international Group A regulations that already utilised by European and Japanese touring car series came into full effect in Australia from 1985 and allowed the international manufacturers to compete on equal terms. Holden was forced briefly into catchup phase and all but backed out of the sport in 1992 after Group A had been dominated by more track-focused production cars such as the turbocharged Ford Sierra RS500 and various Nissan Skylines, as well as the BMW M3.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, a number of the leading teams including the Holden Dealer Team, Dick Johnson Racing, JPS Team BMW and the Peter Jackson Nissan team had begun to make a lot of noise about the very little amount of prize money on offer for their efforts in crisscrossing the country in pursuit of the title. In 1984, the final year of the Group C rules, it was estimated that the Brisbane based Johnson team had covered some 20,000 km in travelling to and from championship meetings, often for as little as AU$1,500 for a win. When CAMS increased the title to 10 rounds in 1986, with little change to the prize money, the teams were threatening that the ATCC would see smaller and smaller grids unless CAMS found a series sponsor. The sponsor that was found was oil giant Shell who put up some $275,000 worth of prize money from the 1987 ATCC, ensuring the long term future of the series.\n\n1992 saw the unhappy demise of Group A and with the international touring car scene fragmenting in several directions (moving towards DTM, Super Touring and Super GT) Australia forged its own path evolving the Group A specification Holden Commodores and re-introducing the Ford Falcon into the new Group 3A regulations that would later be renamed as V8 Supercar.\n\nThe ATCC continued to be used until the end of the 1998 season, after which V8 Supercar organisers altered the name of the series, eventually adopting its present identity, the Supercars Championship.\n\nAccurate to the 2015 Coates Hire Sydney 500.

Pupating on the trunk or close to the ground; often the sexes meet already as larvae and pupate near one another, the male behind the female (Voelschow). Pupa yellowish brown, with darker wing cases.The butterflies occur in July and August and are rather local. On certain days I have seen towards 11 o'clock some numbers come down from the tree-tops to the road where they settled in the dust, not on damp places. As they could not find a firm hold, they frequently tumbled over and remained lying sideways in the sun. Otherwise singly near woods and in avenues of elm-trees.\n\nThe insect has a widely disjunct distribution across the Northern Hemisphere; it is found throughout much of Europe, from Wales to the Urals, southern Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, and again in Siberia, the Russian Far East, Korea, and Japan. It is absent from North America.\n\nIt is widely but patchily distributed across most of England; the butterfly is absent from Ireland, western Wales and most of Cornwall. In 2017, the butterfly was spotted in Scotland again after a gap of 133 years. The spread of second, far more lethal, strain of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s inevitably had a major impact on the British population, but it has since recovered well in places and is still increasing its range.\n\nTo safeguard the future of this butterfly, some conservation organisations within the UK, such as the Hampshire and Isle of Wight branch of Butterfly Conservation and the Forestry Commission, have planted disease-resistant cultivars, notably . The beetle-resistant European white elm has also been planted, notably by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust.\n\nEggs are laid singly, usually on the girdle scars near the terminal buds of elm trees. Unlike other hairstreak eggs, white-letter hairstreak eggs are harder to find during the winter months as they are flatter, turn brown with age, and are thus far less distinct on the twigs.\nWych elm is reputedly preferred, but field elm and European white elm are also used, as are Asiatic species, notably Japanese and Siberian elm, as well as hybrid cultivars such as . The caterpillar hatches in March. Under normal circumstances, where sexually-mature trees occur, it immediately feeds on the flowers, later the seeds, before progressing to the emergent leaves in April. However, research in the Low Countries has shown that the larvae are remarkably adept at using non-flowering suckers; provided they are able to hydrate on emergence, they can survive dormant for up to six weeks, until the leaves flush. The larval stage lasts on average for 57 days, but this can vary from 37 to 78 days, depending on food availability.\n\nPupation takes place underneath a leaf or twig, or in a bark crevice. Adults are on the wing from late June until the middle of August in the UK, where there is one brood a year. The butterflies occasionally fly down from the canopies to nectar from flowers when honeydew is unavailable, notably after heavy rains have washed it from the leaves. The much-preferred flower observed in the UK is creeping thistle, but bramble and others are also used. In France, the butterfly has been observed nectaring on \"Buddleja davidii\", but the flowers of the lime tree appear to be its favourite. \n\n\n"}

The term is most commonly used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, and Commonwealth countries like Canada and Australia, but it is also found in the United States.\n\nCarveries are often found in pubs and hotels, and are particularly commonly held at weekends, when they offer traditional Sunday roasts to a potentially large number of people. The meat is usually accompanied by a choice of potato (boiled, mashed and roasted), stuffing, and vegetables (commonly including carrots, parsnips, peas and other traditional British vegetables). Also provided are gravy and a sauce considered a traditional accompaniment to the various meats (for example, mint sauce to accompany roast lamb, apple sauce to accompany roast pork and so on).\n\nCarveries existed as early as 1956 in London, in two Lyons Corner Houses. One of the restaurants, in each of the Strand and the Tottenham Court Road Lyons, was a carvery. They provided a three-course meal with beverage, but all but the carvery items were served by a Nippy (waitress). Even the carvery table had an employee to help those having difficulty in the actual carving. The price at this time was five shillings.\n\nIn the 1970s and later, many more carveries appeared in London. One well-known carvery was situated in the Regent Palace Hotel. The restaurant there was on the ground floor, the Art Deco ceiling of which has been reassembled in the new Air W1 building.\nLater they were operated by pub chains such as Harvester, Brewer's Fayre and Beefeater. The Toby Carvery brand took over many former Beefeater sites.\n\nThe chain of Fuzzy's Grub in London is a noted carvery, being voted \"Best Traditional British Restaurant, but all but the carv in London\" in Harden's 2007 guide.\n\nCarveries are also commonly offered by many local pubs.\n\nSome restaurants in the US use the term or concept, and it is a staple at some buffets.

In the end, she awakes to find that not more than a few seconds have gone by and that it was all just a dream.\n\nThe story begins with Alice busily talking to herself as she continuously tries to thread a needle through. To her dismay she continues to fail at this and she takes an extremely close look when she finds herself gliding through the air in an unknown world. She mentions how it was December at her previous whereabouts and how in Needle's Eye World it seemed to have a pleasant summer-ish feel to the place. When she finally falls to the ground she is cushioned by a haystack. When she emerges, she hears a distant call for \"'elp\". Alice soon discovers that they were the small whimpers of a Country Mouse, who believes that she is a comet. The Country mouse hereafter befriends Alice and informs her that she is not in a haystack, but an A-stack, or rather a messy pile of A's. She spots a few spelling bees, makes her way out of the haystack and continues in the direction of which she recalls seeing a beach from when she was flying.\n\nAlice does not travel too far before she meets two cats, yet upon taking a closer look, she discovers that both are joined at the tail. Alice questions them of their breed which they reply, as they finish each other's sentences \"We're Siamese--\". Unknowingly, Alice interrupts and discusses how Siamese are much much different in appearance. The cats complete their statement and inform her that they were about to say Siamese-Twin Cats until she so very rudely interrupted. Alice apologizes as the cats begin to explain that one or the other is \"as large as I am\" or \"as intelligent as I am\" continuing in such a manner that their words are reduced to a mere \"--'s I am--\". After a short recovery from their long list, Alice decides that she will identify the cats by naming one Ping and one Pang. For if she mistakes one for the other, surely it must end up being the latter. Ping and Pang recite the poem \"The Sands of Dee\"; Pang forgets the last word of the poem, prompting a duel between them. The two cats instruct Alice to count twenty paces, but she mentions that she could \"...count up to a hundred if I really tried.\" Thus, Ping and Pang begin to step away from each other, but before their duel begins, the sky darkens and rains down cats and dogs. When the peculiar shower of animals has stopped, Ping and Pang realize that they must attend the \"vote.\" Alice follows them to find out what the vote is about.\n\nThe chapter opens with Alice following the Siamese Cats towards the vote. Suddenly, an Elephant rears about near her—the Country Mouse making a short return to frighten it. Alice decides not to frighten the mouse, but at least scare it off. Hereafter, Alice and the Elephant have a conversation about being afraid of little things, the Elephant retorting \"I suppose \"you\" aren't afraid of insects, then?\" After their short argument, the Elephant states that they will be \"late for the speeches.\" Alice is then swept away by the Elephant towards the \"Hide-and-Seek Park.\" Here, she overhears the conversation of the Grampus and the Italian Hairdresser (She knows he is Italian because he speaks in \"Italics\"). The Emu begins its speech, but is constantly interrupted by the Crocodile, belonging to the Hairdresser, which is detained by an electric eel. Finally, the Emu finishes its speech and concludes with \"And \"that's\" why I ask you all to vote for me!\" In the end, after Alice inquires what he stands for, he recites a poem about the letter \"F\". After this, the vote transforms into an auction, and with the final cry of, \"Going...going...\"gone!\"\" everyone abruptly vanishes.\n\nLuckily, not everyone had vanished and Alice was left with both the Grampus and the Italian Hairdresser. The grampus promptly inquires if her name is \"Boris\". After a short discussion, the Grampus realizes that he has indeed written down the wrong name within his autobiography. He explains to Alice how forgetful he is, giving an example of how he sometimes \"leaves home without an umbrella and returns with one\". \"This is why I have an autobiography,\" he said. \"So that I don't forget!\" Both the Grampus and Alice miss the train that he wrote that they would need to get on in his autobiography. He then points out that they are to be attacked by a band of blood-thirsty brigands. After he realizes that the blood-thirsty brigands are not coming, he asks Alice to tie him up. Soon after she \"rescues\" him and they board the next train. As they ride the train, the Grampus begins a discussion on the meaning of words. Promptly after their discussion, the Grampus notes that he does not want to be swept away by the hurricane mentioned in his book. Alice, not wanting to \"create\" a hurricane, comes to the conclusion of simply writing the word 'not' into his book. The train suddenly turns into a study room and, out of curiosity, Alice ventures out to discover what might lie upon the hill she had spotted in the distance.\n\nWhen starting to climb the hill, Alice bumps into two people, or rather, 'stick figure people'. She realizes after a short conversation, that they are Jack and Jill from the nursery rhyme. Although, they are a quite rude rendition of the two. She states that she recognized them from the rhyme which prompts Jack to 'test' her. He says \"If you know then surely you can do this!\" Jack then asks, or commands, Alice to recite the poem forwards, backwards, and in French. Although Alice had no intention of it, she spat out the words as if it were second nature to her. Jack then states that due to the fact that she had 'caused' them to fall, she must now carry the eels or \"L's\" within their bucket to Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Alice sets off because she is too polite to say no in the first place.\n\nAfter a while's walk, Alice reaches a maze-like place with a sign that reads \"Llabyrinth\". To Alice's disappointment, she cannot get to the centre of the maze due to her childish logic of \"If I take all lefts I'll be alright, but if I take all rights I'll be left! Left within the maze!\". Alice comes across several confusing signs, many of which leading her back to the same place she was before. After a moment of despondency, she hears the Country Mouse; she attempts to follow it, but to no avail. She also attempts to throw one of the eels over the hedge as a signal, but fails, as it comes back like a boomerang. Eventually, she drops off to sleep. When she awakes, she sees what she assumes is a human, running past her. She follows it, and in time, arrives in the centre of the maze. After finding a large congregation of animals stuck in the middle of the maze, they attempt to go through a race for the food that the Welsh Rabbit (the one who she had followed into the centre) possesses.\n\nIn this chapter Alice is volunteered for her to go into the rabbit hole which the cluster of animals within the maze believe leads out. When going down the hole, she feels as if she is falling sideways, and describes it as an infinity sign. She contemplates things such as parallel lines meeting at infinity and how the sign looks like a tired eight. When she finally comes out, she is surprised to see where she is.\n\nThese are the main characters listed in order of appearance\n\nThere are several references and homages to Lewis Carroll's novels \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865) and \"Through the Looking-Glass\" (1871). For example, Dinah appears in the beginning, and there is once again a mouse within the plot. In the scene concerning the Llabyrinth, she chases a rabbit and encounters a hole which she must enter.\n\n"}

Achieving little initial success, the song found greater popular acclaim through a recording by John Cale, which inspired a recording by Jeff Buckley. It has been viewed as a \"baseline\" for secular hymns.\n\nFollowing its increased popularity after being featured in the film \"Shrek\" (2001), many other arrangements have been performed in recordings and in concert, with over 300 versions known. The song has been used in film and television soundtracks and televised talent contests. \"Hallelujah\" experienced renewed interest following Cohen's death in November 2016 and appeared on many international singles charts, including entering the American \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the first time.\n\n\"Hallelujah\", in its original version, is in time, which evokes both early rock and roll and gospel music. Written in the key of C major, the chord progression matches lyrics from the song: \"goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, and the major lift\": C, F, G, A minor, F.\n\nCohen wrote around 80 draft verses for \"Hallelujah\", with one writing session at the Royalton Hotel in New York where he was reduced to sitting on the floor in his underwear, banging his head on the floor. His original version, as recorded on his album \"Various Positions\", contains several biblical references, most notably evoking the stories of Samson and Delilah from the Book of Judges (\"she cut your hair\") as well as King David and Bathsheba (\"you saw her bathing on the roof, her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\").\n\nFollowing his original 1984 studio-album version, Cohen performed the original song on his world tour in 1985, but live performances during his 1988 and 1993 tours almost invariably contained a quite different set of lyrics. Numerous singers mix lyrics from both versions, and occasionally make direct lyric changes; for example, in place of Cohen's \"holy dove\", Canadian-American singer Rufus Wainwright substituted \"holy dark\", while Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe sang \"holy ghost\".\n\nCohen's lyrical poetry and his view that \"many different hallelujahs exist\" is reflected in wide-ranging covers with very different intents or tones, allowing the song to be \"melancholic, fragile, uplifting [or] joyous\" depending on the performer: The Welsh singer-songwriter John Cale, the first person to record a cover version of the song (in 1991), promoted a message of \"soberness and sincerity\" in contrast to Cohen's dispassionate tone; the cover by Jeff Buckley, an American singer-songwriter, is more sorrowful and was described by Buckley as \"a hallelujah to the orgasm\"; Crowe interpreted the song as a \"very sexual\" composition that discussed relationships; Wainwright offered a \"purifying and almost liturgical\" interpretation; and Guy Garvey of the British band Elbow made the hallelujah a \"stately creature\" and incorporated his religious interpretation of the song into his band's recordings.\n\nCanadian singer k.d. lang said in an interview shortly after Cohen's death that she considered the song to be about \"the struggle between having human desire and searching for spiritual wisdom. It's being caught between those two places.\" Former Barenaked Ladies frontman Steven Page, who sang the song at Canadian politician Jack Layton's funeral, described the song as being \"about disappointing [other] people\".\n\nSince 1991, \"Hallelujah\" has been performed by a wide variety of singers: over 300, and in various languages. Statistics from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Canadian Recording Industry Association, the Australian Recording Industry Association, and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, show that, by late 2008, more than five million copies of the song sold in CD format. It has been the subject of a BBC Radio documentary, a book, and been in the soundtracks of numerous films and television programs. Different interpretations of the song may include different verses, out of the over 80 verses Cohen originally wrote.\n\nIn an April 2009 CBC Radio interview, Cohen said he found the number of covers of his song \"ironic and amusing\", given that his record label refused to release it when he first wrote it; however, he then claimed the song could benefit from a break in exposure:\n\nI was just reading a review of a movie called \"Watchmen\" that uses it and the reviewer said – \"Can we please have a moratorium on 'Hallelujah' in movies and television shows?\" And I kind of feel the same way ... I think it's a good song, but I think too many people sing it.\n\nConversely, in early 2012, while promoting his then-current album, \"Old Ideas\", Cohen stated he wasn't tired of the song being covered:\n\nThere's been a couple of times when other people have said can we have a moratorium please on \"Hallelujah\"? Must we have it at the end of every single drama and every single \"Idol\"? And once or twice I've felt maybe I should lend my voice to silencing it but on second thought no, I'm very happy that it's being sung.\n\nJohn Cale's cover first appeared on \"I'm Your Fan\" (1991), a Leonard Cohen tribute album, and later on his live album \"Fragments of a Rainy Season\" (1992). Cale's version has vocals, piano, and different lyrics that Cohen had only performed live such as \"I used to live alone before I knew you\" and \"All I ever learned from love was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you\". Cale had watched Cohen perform the song and asked Cohen to send him the lyrics. Cohen then faxed Cale 15 pages of lyrics. Cale claims that he \"went through and just picked out the cheeky verses.\"\n\nCale's version forms the basis of most subsequent performances, including Cohen's performances during his 2008–09 world tour. Cale's version is used in the film \"Shrek\" (2001), but Rufus Wainwright's version appears on . Cale's also appears on the first soundtrack album for the TV series \"Scrubs\" and as the ending song of the \"Cold Case\" episode \"Death Penalty, Final Appeal\".\n\nJeff Buckley, inspired by Cale's earlier cover, recorded one of the most acclaimed versions of \"Hallelujah\" for his only complete album, \"Grace\", in 1994. It was posthumously released as a single in 2007, ten years after Buckley's death.\n\nIn 2004, Buckley's version was ranked number 259 on \"Rolling Stone\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The same year \"Time\" called Buckley's version \"exquisitely sung,\" observing \"Cohen murmured the original like a dirge, but ... Buckley treated the ... song like a tiny capsule of humanity, using his voice to careen between glory and sadness, beauty and pain ... It's one of the great songs.\"\n\nIn September 2007, a poll of fifty songwriters conducted by the magazine \"Q\" listed \"Hallelujah\" among the all-time \"Top 10 Greatest Tracks\" with John Legend calling Buckley's version \"as near perfect as you can get. The lyrics to 'Hallelujah' are just incredible and the melody's gorgeous and then there's Jeff's interpretation of it. It's one of the most beautiful pieces of recorded music I've ever heard.\" In July 2009, the Buckley track was ranked number three on the 2009 Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, a listener poll held every decade by the Australian radio station Triple J. In 2017, The International Observer named Buckley's version of \"Hallelujah\" the greatest song of all time.\n\nOn 2 April 2014, it was announced that Buckley's version of the song will be inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry.\n\nBuckley's version was not an instant hit, nor did Buckley live to see the full measure of the reception his recording would ultimately have; he died in 1997. The album on which it appeared did not go Gold in the U.S. until 2002, nine years after its release. In fact, like Cohen's original, the Buckley version was not released as a single, until much later, and it didn't chart until 2006, posthumously for Buckley. In March of that year, Buckley had his first national top 10 best-seller when \"Hallelujah\" was at number seven in Norway. In 2007, it made the top 3 on the Swedish charts. In March 2008, it topped \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Hot Digital Songs in the U.S. after a performance of the song by Jason Castro in the seventh season of \"American Idol\". The sudden resurgence of interest provided both Gold and Platinum status, the RIAA certifying the digital track on 22 April 2008. It has sold 1,144,000 digital copies in the US as of May 2010. It also hit number one in France in March 2008.\n\nThe Buckley version has been widely used in film and television dramas, including the series \"The West Wing\", \"Crossing Jordan\", \"Without a Trace\", \"The O.C.\", \"House\", \"Dirt\", \"Criminal Minds\", \"ER\", \"Third Watch\", \"Ugly Betty\", \"LAX\", \"NCIS\", \"Justiça\", \"Longmire\", and \"Sense8\" and the films \"Feast of Love\", \"The Edukators\", \"Vinterkyss\" and \"Lord of War\". \"Hallelujah can be joyous or bittersweet, depending on what part of it you use\", \"Time\" quoted Buckley's publisher as saying. The magazine opined that its liberal use in some cases was \"a tacit admission that neither the writers nor the actors could convey their characters' emotions as well as Buckley.\"\n\nOn 20 April 2013, Buckley's version of the song was played at Fenway Park during a tribute honoring the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing before the Red Sox played their first home game following the tragedy.\n\n\n\nCanadian-American musician and singer Rufus Wainwright had briefly met Jeff Buckley and recorded a tribute to him after his 1997 death. That song, \"Memphis Skyline\", referenced Buckley's version of \"Hallelujah\", which Wainwright would later record, though using piano and a similar arrangement to Cale's. Wainwright's version is included on the album \"\", although it was Cale's version that was used in the film itself. The \"Shrek\" soundtrack, containing Wainwright's cover, was certified 2× Platinum in the United States in 2003 as selling over two million copies.\n\nRufus Wainwright, his sister Martha Wainwright, and Joan Wasser performed the song in the film \"\".\n\nIn 2004, k.d. lang recorded a version of \"Hallelujah\" on her album \"Hymns of the 49th Parallel\". She has since sung it at several major events, such as at the Canadian Juno Awards of 2005, where it \"brought the audience to its feet for a two-minute ovation.\" Lang also sang it at the 2006 Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame when Cohen was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Cohen's partner, singer Anjani Thomas, said: \"After hearing k.d. lang perform that song at the Canadian Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2006 we looked at each other and said, 'well, I think we can lay that song to rest now! It's really been done to its ultimate blissful state of perfection'.\" Lang sang it at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, before a claimed TV audience of three billion.\n\nLang again performed the song at the 2017 \"\" concert.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, the Norwegian quartet of Espen Lind, Kurt Nilsen, Alejandro Fuentes and Askil Holm released a cover of the song. After debuting at number 8 on the Norwegian VG-lista, the single reached number one in January 2007. The song remained listed on the Norwegian top 20 for 37 (non-consecutive) weeks between 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe song also appears on the 2006 album \"Hallelujah Live\", credited to Espen Lind with Kurt Nilsen, Alejandro Fuentes and Askil Holm, which also reached the top of the Norwegian VG-lista.\n\nAlexandra Burke, the winner of the fifth series of the reality television show \"The X Factor\", released a condensed cover version of the song as a prize for her victory. It reached Christmas number one on the UK Singles Chart on 21 December 2008.\n\nThe release of Burke's cover created interest in the previous versions of the song, including a Buckley fan campaign to take Buckley's cover to the top of the Christmas chart and therefore deny Burke the top spot. The campaign was fuelled by Buckley fans' dislike of \"The X Factor\"s commercialism and the song's arrangement, as well as their desire to introduce younger people to Buckley's version. Burke herself was not enamoured of the choice of song, remarking \"It just didn't do anything for me.\"\n\nBurke's version broke a European sales record after selling over 105,000 digital downloads in just one day, breaking the previous record set by Leona Lewis. The song sold 576,000 copies in its first week, becoming the fastest-selling single released by a woman in the United Kingdom and the 2008 Christmas number one, while Buckley's cover charted at number two and Cohen's original version at number 36.\n\nOn 28 December 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed Burke's version as the biggest-selling single of the year, with \"NME\" announcing sales of over one million copies since its release. This also made Burke the first ever female British artist to have a million-selling single in the UK. It has sold 1.297 million as of August 2016, making it the biggest-selling \"X Factor\" winner's single to date.\n\n|}\n\nThe a cappella group Pentatonix covered the song in the quintet's 2016 album, \"A Pentatonix Christmas\". On 21 October 2016, Pentatonix also released a music video for its cover.\n\n\nBob Dylan was among the first to perform Cohen's song in concert with his earliest noted performance being in Montreal on 8 July 1988. Other notable singers who have covered \"Hallelujah\" include Brandi Carlile, Regina Spektor, Willie Nelson, Susan Boyle, Tim Minchin, Myles Kennedy, and Bono. Bono's version, which is mostly spoken, was included in \"Tower of Song\", an all-star tribute to Cohen in 1995. Bon Jovi has covered the song several times in concert, including on their 2008 \"Live at Madison Square Garden\" DVD.\n\nInternational group Il Divo released a Spanish-language adaptation with different lyrics on their album \"The Promise\" (2008), which topped the charts in the UK. The song was performed by recording artist Damien Rice at the 2008 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions when Cohen was inducted. That same year Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins recorded a classical-crossover version for her album \"Sacred Arias\". Kate Voegele performed it in character as Mia Catalano in the U.S. teen drama \"One Tree Hill\". Also appearing on an album, her version made the Hot 100 \"Billboard\" charts and reached number 53 in the UK shortly after airing of the episode there. Also in 2008, the Welsh band Brigyn released a version in Welsh. In 2009 Swedish artist Ebba Forsberg released a version sung in Swedish.\n\nThe song has become a staple of television talent shows. Jason Castro, an \"American Idol\" season 7 contestant, performed a version on 4 March 2008, which propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the \"Billboard\" digital song chart. His version was included in his self-titled debut album and his second studio album, \"Who I Am\". Lisa Hordijk, winner of the 2009 Dutch \"X Factor\", released \"Hallelujah\" as her debut single, which went double platinum and remained at the top of the Dutch charts for ten weeks.\n\nA 2009 hit by Orthodox Jewish singer Ohad Moskowitz, \"\"Bo'i Kala\"\", featuring the words of the traditional tune accompanying a Jewish bride to the chuppah, is a musical adaptation of \"Hallelujah\".\n\nOn 22 January 2010, American musicians Justin Timberlake, Matt Morris, and Charlie Sexton performed a live cover version of \"Hallelujah\" during the \"Hope for Haiti Now\" telethon in support of those affected by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. A recorded version was released the following day on the \"Hope for Haiti Now\" soundtrack album and reached a peak of No. 13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\n\nOn 16 April 2010, the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and the Richard Eaton Singers conducted by Jack Everly premiered a new arrangement for orchestra and chorus by Claude Lapalme. Also in 2010, the Maccabeats of Yeshiva University released \"Voices from the Heights\", with an \"a cappella\" version of \"Hallelujah\" set to the Hebrew words of the Shabbat liturgical poem \"Lecha Dodi\".\n\nSteven Page performed the song live at the state funeral of Canadian Opposition Leader Jack Layton on 27 August 2011.\n\nRaul Esparza performed the song live at the Kennedy Center's 11 September Memorial Concert on 8 September 2011.\n\nIn May 2012, Canada's Royal Winnipeg Ballet presented the World Premiere of \"The Doorway – Scenes from Leonard Cohen\", created and choreographed by Jorden Morris – with \"Hallelujah\" performed by Allison Crowe (voice and piano) and ballerinas Sophia Lee and Jo-Ann Gudilin dancing alternate dates.\n\nOn the December 17, 2012 episode of The Voice (American TV series), the song was covered in tribute to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by hosts Christina Aguilera, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Cee Lo Green.\n\nAmerican actor, comedian and musician Adam Sandler performed an off-color parody of \"Hallelujah\" in December 2012 at Madison Square Garden in New York City as part of , with Paul Shaffer on piano. Sandler's version contained numerous references to Hurricane Sandy and contemporary events in local culture, sports and politics.\n\nSinger Tori Kelly recorded a cover of \"Hallelujah\" for the animated film \"Sing\" and has done two notable live performances of the song: during the \"In Memoriam\" portion of the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, and alongside Luis Fonsi during the 2017 \"\" telethon.\n\nOn the 9th of November 2016, a video of klezmer musician Daniel Kahn & the Painted Bird playing the song on the guitar and singing it in Yiddish was published on YouTube as a tribute to Leonard Cohen after his death.\n\nOn 12 November 2016, an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" opened with cast member Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton performing a rendition of the song in tribute to both Cohen and Clinton; the preceding week had seen both Cohen's death and Clinton's unexpected loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe American comedian and musician Owen Benjamin used the music of \"Hallelujah\" with new lyrics in his song titled \"How They Rule Ya\" in support of freeing British far right activist Tommy Robinson, who was held at the time for contempt of court charges for violating a press gag order and encouraging vigilante action against Muslim defendants while reporting on British grooming gangs. Released on 12 June 2018 under the alternative title \"Free Tommy Robinson\", it charted in the UK iTunes Charts. The song was later covered in a studio version by Coddington Bear. Robinson as a tribute and gratitude to Owen Benjamin, upon his release led the crowd outside the Old Bailey to a rendition of the song written by Benjamin.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n"}

He received the Billboard's New Artist of the Year and the Single of the Year Award in 1979. He was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and was a frequent performer at the Grand Ole Opry. Downing was nominated as Best New Artist by the Academy of Country Music and appeared on \"Hee Haw\", \"Nashville Now\", and Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand\" television programs.\n\nDowning began his career doing piano and vocals in Bobby Poe and The Poe Kats, who were an early backing band for country entertainer Wanda Jackson. His piano contributed to the single \"Let’s Have A Party\", which was released in 1960. The song reached #32 on the UK charts and made the Top 40 on the U.S. pop chart.\n\nDowning reached the U.S. Hot 100 with \"You’ll Never Miss the Water (Till the Well Runs Dry)\", a duet with Little Esther Phillips. After the release of this single, he was signed by Warner Brothers. In 1974, Downing recorded the single, \"I'll Be Holding On\", which went to number one on the U.S. Disco charts for three weeks. In addition, \"I'll Be Holding On\" was a hit in Europe. On the other US charts, the single went to #31 on the soul chart and #85 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nAl Downing's popularity continued to grow, and he had several hits on the country charts between 1978 and 1989. He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, \"Mr. Jones\" reached the Top 20, followed by \"Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)\" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced \"Midnight Lace,\" which reached the 50s on the charts, and \"I Ain't No Fool,\" which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the \"Story Behind The Story\" reached the Top 40 and \"Bring It On Home\" reached the Top 20.\n\nTwo years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, \"I'll Be Loving You\" reached the Top 50, followed by \"Darlene,\" which reached the lower 60s. The next year, \"It Takes Love\" reached the Top 40, followed by \"Let's Sing About Love,\" which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, \"The Best Of Families\" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, \"There’ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong\".\n\nIn 1987, \"Big Al\" was signed by the Vine Street label, which released the \"Oh How Beautiful You Are\" (To Me) and \"Just One Night Won't Do,\" both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, \"I Guess By Now.\"\n\nThe popular entertainer Fats Domino recorded two songs written by Downing: \"Mary, Oh Mary\" and \"Heartbreak Hill\". Bobby \"Blue\" Bland and Tom Jones have also recorded Downing's songs.\n\nDowning built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, \"Classic Collection\". This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including \"Mr. Jones.\"\n\nIn July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in Green Bay, Wisconsin with dozens of other Rockabilly greats.\n\nIn 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, \"One of A Kind\". The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on \"American Roots Country\" and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\nDowning continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at Ontario's prestigious Havelock Country Jamboree with Kenny Rogers and Roy Clark. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Soon after, he commenced chemotherapy treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.\n\nDowning's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including rock and roll, blues, roots, gospel and country. He performed rhythm and blues and disco throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in Washington D.C.. He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.\n\nIn additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an artists and repertoire (A&R) agent. In 2003 he produced the album \"Straight Beat\" with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represents his last recording.\n\n\n"}

Often referred to as the \"sister college\" of King's College, Lagos, it was founded on October 10, 1927, when Nigeria was still a British colony.\n\nNigeria has a 6-3-3-4 system of education. Queen's College takes the secondary pupils in the middle two phases. There are six year groups, or grades; each year group contains about 600 students divided into several arms. Recently, class sizes have reduced to an average of 40 per class. The total population for the 2006/2007 session was 2,160 students.\n\nThe school has returned the best results nationwide in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) conducted by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) seven times since 1985 and is widely considered to be one of the top schools on the African continent. The school motto is \"Pass On The Torch.\" It's one of the best female secondary School in Nigeria. Bringing out the best in Girls and girl child education.\n\nQueen's College was established in October 10, 1927, with an enrolment of 20 students, a Principal and eight part-time teachers. Sylvia Leith-Ross was appointed \"Lady Superintendent of Education\" in 1925 and she helped to establish Queen's College as a girl's boarding school.\n\nQueen's College has grown to a population 3000 students, and a staff strength of well over 300 full-time teachers.\n\nQueen's College has provided education for girls in Nigeria - creating equal gender opportunities for them in professional fields. Girls are given the opportunity to pursue courses in the Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, Law, Architecture, the Arts, etc.\n\nThe school operates at two levels: junior and senior school. The lowest forms, JS I to JS III, make up the junior school. Students in those forms study for the Junior School Certificate Examination conducted by the National Examination Council (NECO) and taken at the end of their third year. The Senior School Examination is the goal of the students in the upper forms.\nTwo examination bodies – West African Examinations Council and National Examinations Council – are each empowered to conduct separately the end-of-course examination and students are to enter for both examinations.\nThe senior and junior schools are distinct in their operations. Each stream of JS 1 through SS 3 has about eleven classrooms with varying numbers of students.\n\nFor management of both sections, the school is headed by the principal, designated PQC (Principal Queen's College) who is assisted by three vice principals:\n\nThe curriculum of the school covers Science, Social Science, Arts -and vocational subjects as well as co-curricular activities. In line with the 6-3-3 4 system of education, the scope has been enlarged to give a broad-based education with subjects that can lead to courses in tertiary institutions. Staff and twelve Guidance Counselors are available to assist students in learning, in their choice of career, social adjustment, as well as their welfare.\n\nSubjects offered in both Junior and Senior schools are: \n\nThe girls are involved in games and sports. The annual inter-house sports competition is usually held during the second term of the academic session.\nThe school has six houses that compete in the inter-house games, namely Dan-Fodio (Red House), Obasa (Blue House), Obi (Yellow House), Emotan (Green House), Efunjoke (Purple House) and Obong (Orange House).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2186444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186444", "title": "Laser-hybrid welding", "text": "Laser-hybrid welding\n\nLaser-hybrid welding is a type of welding process that combines the principles of laser beam welding and arc welding.\n\nThe combination of laser light and an electrical arc into an amalgamated welding process has existed since the 1970s, but has only recently been used in industrial applications. There are three main types of hybrid welding process, depending on the arc used: TIG, plasma arc or MIG augmented laser welding. While TIG-augmented laser welding was the first to be researched, MIG is the first to go into industry and is commonly known as hybrid laser welding.\n\nWhereas in the early days laser sources still had to prove their suitability for industrial use, today they are standard equipment in many manufacturing enterprises.\nThe combination of laser welding with another weld process is called a \"hybrid welding process\". This means that a laser beam and an electrical arc act simultaneously in one welding zone, influencing and supporting each other.\n\nLaser welding not only requires high laser power but also a high quality beam to obtain the desired \"deep-weld effect\". The resulting higher quality of beam can be exploited either to obtain a smaller focus diameter or a larger focal distance. A variety of laser types are used for this process, in particular where the laser light can be transmitted via a water-cooled glass fiber. The beam is projected onto the workpiece by collimating and focusing optics. Carbon dioxide laser can also be used where the beam is transmitted via lens or mirrors.\n\nFor welding metallic objects, the laser beam is focused to obtain intensities of more than 1 MW/cm. When the laser beam hits the surface of the material, this spot is heated up to vaporization temperature, and a vapor cavity is formed in the weld metal due to the escaping metal vapor. This is known as a keyhole. The extraordinary feature of the weld seam is its high depth-to-width ratio. The energy-flow density of the freely burning arc is slightly more than 100 kW/cm. Unlike a dual process where two separate weld processes act in succession, hybrid welding may be viewed as a combination of both weld processes acting simultaneously in one and the same process zone. Depending on the kind of arc or laser process used, and depending on the process parameters, the two systems will influence each other in different ways.\n\nThe combination of the laser process and the arc process results in an increase in both weld penetration depth and welding speed (as compared to each process alone). The metal vapor escaping from the vapor cavity acts upon the arc plasma. Absorption of the laser radiation in the processing plasma remains negligible. Depending on the ratio of the two power inputs, the character of the overall process may be mainly determined either by the laser or by the arc.\n\nAbsorption of the laser radiation is substantially influenced by the temperature of the workpiece surface. Before the laser welding process can start, the initial reflectance must be overcome, especially on aluminum surfaces. This can be achieved by preheating the material. In the hybrid process, the arc heats the metal, helping the laser beam to couple in. After the vaporisation temperature has been reached, the vapor cavity is formed, and nearly all radiation energy can be put into the workpiece. The energy required for this is thus determined by the temperature-dependent absorption and by the amount of energy lost by conduction into the rest of the workpiece. In laser-hybrid welding, using MIG, vaporisation takes place not only from the surface of the workpiece but also from the filler wire, so that more metal vapor is available to facilitate the absorption of the laser radiation.\n\nOver the years a great deal of research has been done to understand fatigue behavior, particularly for new techniques like laser-hybrid welding, but knowledge is still limited. Laser-hybrid welding is an advanced welding technology that creates narrow deep welds and offers greater freedom to control the weld surface geometry. Therefore, fatigue analysis and life prediction of hybrid weld joints has become more important and is the subject of ongoing research.\n\n"}

Llodra has been called \"the best volleyer on tour\".\n\nLlodra was born in Paris, where his father Michel played for football club Paris Saint-Germain. A left-hander, his serve-and-volley style is modelled on that of his idol, Stefan Edberg.\n\nLlodra and his wife Camille were married on 9 September 2003, and have two children, a daughter, Manon (born March 23, 2004) and a son, Teo (born 5 September 2007). He is a well-known supporter of French football club Paris Saint-Germain, and has often been seen wearing the club's shirt prior to tennis matches.\n\nLlodra reached his first Grand Slam final, the Australian Open men's doubles, with Fabrice Santoro. Unseeded, they lost to Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. During his semifinal, Llodra inadvertently hit a bird.\n\nLlodra won his first Grand Slam title, the Australian Open men's doubles, with Fabrice Santoro. Their opponents in the final were once again Knowles and Nestor.\n\nUpon winning the men's doubles again for the second time at the Australian Open in 2004, Llodra and his tennis partner Santoro made headlines by stripping off their shirts, shoes, socks and shorts. Dressed in a pair of white briefs only, Llodra threw his clothes into the crowd, to the cheers of many onlookers.\n\nLlodra made his first appearance in the fourth round of a Grand Slam singles tournament at that year's French Open. In the fourth round he led eventual semifinalist Tim Henman by two sets to love and had a match point in the fifth set before Henman prevailed. Llodra also won his first ATP singles title two weeks later at 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nOn 20 November 2005, Llodra teamed up with French compatriot Fabrice Santoro to win the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, a competition which pitted the top-8 doubles teams in the world against one another.\n\nIn July, Llodra won the men's doubles title at Wimbledon partnering Arnaud Clément, beating Bob and Mike Bryan, thus winning his third Grand Slam doubles title. He and Clément were ecstatic and Llodra once again celebrated by throwing his shirt, racket and towel into the crowd.\n\nAt the US Open, he and Clément were seeded seventh, but were upset in the second round by Jesse Levine and Alex Kuznetsov, 7–6, 6–4.\n\nLlodra and Clément reached a second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, but lost to the Israeli pairing of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram.\n\nIn singles, Llodra won two tournaments in the course of two months, the first in Adelaide, where he defeated Jarkko Nieminen in the final, and the other in Rotterdam, where he edged out Robin Söderling in a third-set tiebreak.\n\nLlodra and his doubles partner Clément then defeated the Bryan Brothers again in four sets at the Davis Cup quarterfinals tie against the US team. They are one of two teams to defeat the Bryans in Davis Cup.\n\nHe then entered the French Open, where he upset Tomáš Berdych in the second round and went on to reach the fourth round, losing to Latvian Ernests Gulbis in straight sets.\n\nHe made two finals in singles; the Open 13 in Marseille (l. to Tsonga) and the Grand Prix in Lyon (l. to Ljubicic). He also had a poor season in doubles.\n\nLlodra started off the season with opening round losses in Brisbane and Sydney. He made the second round of the Australian Open, losing to Juan Mónaco in five sets.\n\nHe lost to Marco Chiudinelli in the opening round in Rotterdam. The following week, he impressively won the Open 13 tournament in Marseille. He beat two well-known players on the rise: seventh seed Marcos Baghdatis (in the second round) and top seed Robin Söderling (in the quarterfinals). In the final, he defeated Julien Benneteau in straight sets in their first meeting on the ATP tour. Llodra and Benneteau also teamed up to win the doubles title in Marseille, thus making him the singles and doubles champion of the 2010 tournament. Llodra also won at Eastbourne, beating Guillermo García-López in straight sets in the final.\n\nLlodra lost in the first round at the French Open, the second round at Wimbledon to Andy Roddick in four sets, and made the third round at the US Open (including an impressive straight-set win over seventh seed Tomáš Berdych) before retiring against Tommy Robredo.\n\nAt the BNP Paribas Masters tournament in Paris-Bercy, he played his best tennis in an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, where he defeated second seed Novak Djokovic and then eleventh seed Nikolay Davydenko in the quarterfinals. Llodra then held three match points against world No. 5 and eventual champion Robin Söderling, but eventually lost in a third-set tiebreak. Had Llodra won, it would have been an all-French final in Paris with compatriot Gaël Monfils.\n\nAt the Australian Open, Llodra and Zimonjic lost in the quarterfinals to Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in straight sets. They reached the final in Rotterdam, but lost to Jürgen Melzer and Petzschner in a super-tiebreak. They reached the semifinals in Dubai, but lost to Jérémy Chardy and Feliciano López, again in a super-tiebreak. They reached the quarterfinals in Miami, again losing to Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes. In Madrid, they lost the final to the Bryan brothers. In Rome, they reached the quarterfinals, losing to Carlos Berlocq and Jarkko Nieminen.\n\nThe team made the semifinals at the French Open and at Wimbledon, losing to Max Mirnyi and Daniel Nestor in a match featuring two tiebreaks, and to the Bryan brothers in a five-set thriller, also with two tiebreaks. They won their first two titles of the year in Washington, D.C. and at the Canadian Open, against Robert Lindstedt and Horia Tecău and the Bryan brothers, respectively. They lost in the final in Cincinnati, again against Bhupathi and Paes.\n\nThey did not make it past the round of 16 at the US Open, but they took their third title of the year at the China Open, again against Lindstedt and Tecau. They lost in the final in Shanghai against Mirnyi and Nestor in a super-tiebreak. They took their fourth title together in Basel, again defeating Mirnyi and Nestor in the final in straight sets.\n\nThey reached the quarterfinals in Bercy and participated in the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals in London, winning their first round-robin match against Rohan Bopanna and Aisam Qureshi.\n\nIn singles, Llodra reached the quarterfinals in Marseille, losing to Robin Söderling in straight sets.

He also beat American Sam Querrey in the quarterfinals. He faced David Ferrer for a place in the final, but lost.\n\nAt the Dubai Open, Llodra stunned world No. 8 and Australian Open 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in straight sets, but lost to Dmitry Tursunov in the next round. Llodra was also in the men's doubles finals of the French Open 2013 with his partner Nicolas Mahut, but lost to the Bryan brothers in the final.\n\nIn 2014 Llodra played fewer tournaments and had less success in singles than the previous years. He suffered first-round losses at the Australian Open and French Open, and skipped Wimbledon. He did, however, get a win at the US Open, defeating Daniel Gimeno-Traver in straight sets.\n\nLlodra is known for his skilled net play. The Guardian journalist Xan Brooks described Llodra as \"one of those talented, maddening French players in the tradition of Henri Leconte, Guy Forget and Fabrice Santoro; at once supremely gifted and curiously brittle\" and that he \"plays like he's just flown in from the 20th-century. His game is all dinks and slices and sly changes of pace.\" Two-time French Open finalist Robin Söderling called Llodra's serve \"unbelievable\" and his volleys the \"best on the tour\". To aid his touch on volleys, Llodra is one of the few professionals to use all natural gut strings, which give him better feel at the expense of power at the baseline.\n\nLlodra is one of the last remaining serve-and-volleyers in the top ranks of men's professional tennis, a tactic aided by his left-handed serve which allows him to create unusual angles. Llodra has been called the 'best serve and volleyer in the world' by the website Essential Tennis.\n\nIn the 2002 Australian Open men's doubles semifinal against Julien Boutter and Arnaud Clément, a small bird (identified as a house martin) flew into the court chasing a moth. It flew into the path of a hard hit volley by Llodra. After an impromptu funeral ceremony led by Boutter, the match continued, with Llodra and Santoro eventually winning 6–3, 3–6, 12–10. Llodra remarked afterwards, \"I didn't do it deliberately. But at least I saved the moth.\"\n\nIn the 2005 Key Biscayne tournament, Llodra was hiding nude in Ivan Ljubicic's locker. When Ljubicic discovered him, Llodra stated that he \"tried to get his positive energy\". In 2005 Ljubicic was playing his most successful season by then.\n\nAfter his first round victory over Ernests Gulbis at the 2012 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, during which Llodra was overheard by fans and journalists making racist and sexist comments to a female Gulbis fan, Llodra was fined $2500 by the ATP for his behaviour. He later admitted making the comments in interviews with French media and complained that the fine was too high. Llodra did not make matters better for himself during an interview with a reporter from the Chinese news Web site SINA.com, in which the Frenchman attempted to apologize for his remarks. \"My words were not aimed at China,\" Llodra began. \"I love Chinese — I can totally make love with a Chinese girl,\" he added, before being cut off by the A.T.P. official monitoring the interview. The journalist, who took offense at the remark, said that he did not find Llodra's apology sincere. This was not the first incident in which charges of racism have been leveled at Llodra. He denied his comments were racist during his 2011 French Open first round defeat at the hands of Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis, comparing the atmosphere on court to that of a north African souk while veteran Moroccan umpire Mohammed El Jennati was in the chair.\n\n"}

The informal names for the species and its subspecies include eastern or southern banjo frog, and bull frog. The frog is also called the pobblebonk after its distinctive \"bonk\" call, which is likened to a banjo string being plucked. There are five subspecies of \"L. dumerilii\", each with different skin coloration. The species is native to eastern Australia. There has been one occurrence in New Zealand, when tadpoles of the species were found in 1999 and destroyed.\n\nAdults are roughly seven to eight centimetres long with dark warty backs, a prominent tibial gland, fleshy metatarsal tubercules and a smooth white or mottled belly. The tadpole stage is relatively long, lasting up to fifteen months. The species is common.\nThe five subspecies of \"Limnodynastes dumerilii\" are:\n\nThis is the most widespread of the five subspecies. It is mostly associated with the slopes and ranges of New South Wales, northern Victoria and the Murray River into South Australia. This subspecies normally inhabits woodland, heathland and farmland. Breeding takes place in streams, ponds and dams. Males of this subspecies have the most characteristic banjo-like \"bonk\" of all the subspecies. They are distinguished from other subspecies by more orange present on the flank and orange raised stripe present from the eye to the shoulder. The subspecies is normally one solid colour on the dorsal surface.\n\nThis subspecies occurs along the coast of New South Wales, south to Jervis Bay. It inhabits coastal swamps, dams, ponds associated with forest and heathland. This species does not breed in flowing water, which helps with distinguishing it from \"L. d. dumerilii\" in places where both occur. This is the most variegated of the subspecies, often with patches or blotches of a different colour on the dorsal surface. The call of this species sounds more like a \"tok\", similar but louder than the striped marsh frog.\n\nThis is the most restricted of the subspecies. It is only found in the Snowy Mountains area of south-eastern New South Wales. Males call from ponds or pools of streams in spring and summer. Due to its restricted range it is unlikely to be confused with other subspecies, however it is pale on the dorsal surface with fairly indistinct patches or variegations.\n\nThis subspecies occurs south of Jervis Bay, along the south coast of New South Wales, in eastern Victoria and throughout Tasmania. It is characterised and distinguished by blue coloration present on the flank. There is often a pale mid-dorsal stripe. Males call from a concealed position in water during spring, summer and autumn.\n\nThis subspecies is very similar to \"Limnodynastes dumerilii insularis\". This subspecies occurs in western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It is chiefly distinguished by range.\n\n\"Limnodynastes dumerilii\" is a burrowing frog. During dry times, and often just during the day, they will burrow underground. They will often be seen in large numbers after rain, and under the right conditions mass spawning can occur over just a few days. They have been known to call while underground, and can do so at any time of the year after rain.\n\nIn Western Australia the western banjo frog, \"Limnodynastes dorsalis\", is common around Perth. It also has a musical, resonant \"plonk\" call and is also called a pobblebonk.\n\nIn Queensland, the scarlet-sided pobblebonk, \"Limnodynastes terraereginae\", is a small fat frog with distinctive orange or red irregular markings.\n\nIn Western New South Wales, the giant banjo frog, \"Limnodynastes interioris\", is a similar species that tends to inhabit more arid areas than \"Limnodynastes dumerilii\".\n\n\n"}

Meanwhile, Pierce is trying to treat a patient with hysterical paralysis.\n\nRadar is feeding his animals World War II surplus powdered milk from a surgical glove when Lieutenant Colonel Blake walks up after having just taken a shower. Blake gives Radar back his pet turtle, which he found in the shower. Radar then interrupts Pierce, who is making out with Nurse Baker, so that he can sign a patient's release form. While signing the form, Pierce notices a scratch on Radar's hand. Radar tells him that a mutt that sticks around the camp bit him. Pierce then informs Radar that rabies and dysentery are two of the most prevalent diseases in Korea, and that the dog needs to be tested to see if it is a carrier.\n\nOrderlies are unloading wounded soldiers from a bus, but Major Burns tells them not to unload one particular soldier because he is not physically wounded and needs to be treated in Tokyo for shell shock. Pierce and McIntyre insist that he be treated at the 4077th against Burns' orders. In the recovery room, Pierce finds out that the soldier, Corporal Travis, was in a fox hole when tanks attacked his unit. He lost consciousness, and when he came to, he couldn't move. Pierce then calls Dr. Sidney Freedman to ask him to come to the 4077th to treat Corporal Travis. Dr. Freedman tells Pierce that he is too busy and recommends a course of action that Pierce should follow. Pierce goes back into the recovery room where Major Houlihan complains to him about the fact that her nurses are having to constantly clean up Corporal Travis because Pierce has ordered that he is not to use a bedpan, but must walk to the latrine. Corporal Travis thinks that Pierce is being overly cruel, but Pierce is following Dr. Freedman's advice by trying to convince him that nothing is physically wrong with his legs.\n\nRadar and Blake are out looking for the dog when they run into Rosie. They ask Rosie if they've seen the dog, and Rosie, in turn, asks a Korean man, who tells Rosie that the dog was delicious. Radar panics until they ask the old man if the dog had a collar, and the man says no, which means that it was not Radar's dog. But, until it is found, Radar must begin the vaccination process.\n\nMajor Houlihan tries to comfort Radar after he is given his first dose of the vaccine. She tells him that he has a letter from a young lady and asks if he would like her to read it to him. He says that he would. The letter is from a 17-year-old girl from the United States who got his name from the Red Cross. She tells him a little bit about herself and asks a few questions about him. Radar falls asleep by the time Major Houlihan finishes the letter.\n\nMajors Burns and Houlihan complain to Colonel Blake about Corporal Travis having to crawl to the mess tent to eat. Pierce defends his actions as following the recommendations of Dr. Freedman and that, by sending him home, his guilt will only serve to reinforce his hysterical paralysis. Finally, Corporal Travis opens up to Trapper John.\n\nBlake, looking in on Radar's pets, spots the dog that bit Radar. He and McIntyre chase it all over camp. After they catch it, they determine that it doesn't have rabies, so Radar can stop the treatments. During a meeting of all the doctors in Blake's office and Major Houlihan, Corporal Travis walks in under his own power to prove Pierce and Dr. Freedman were right.\n\n"}

As the Eastern Railway was extended its importance grew, becoming an important hub for gold miners arriving in Western Australia via ship and then travelling to the Yilgarn and Eastern Goldfields when the line opened to Kalgoorlie in 1896.\n\nIn 1907, a new station and marshalling yards were established 300 metres to the north-east on the site of the former Fremantle Railway Workshops to better service the newly constructed Fremantle Harbour.\n\nThe station was designed by William Dartnall, Chief Engineer of Existing Lines of the Railway Department in 1905. The construction contract, at an estimated cost of ₤80,000, was awarded in May 1906 to S.B. Alexander and completed on 20 April 1907, with the official opening on 1 July 1907.\n\nOriginally the station had three 150 metre platforms, one side and one island, with a subway connection and an overall roof. This had been taken out of use by the 1960s and was later demolished. Until the 1960s, passenger services continued south of Fremantle to Kwinana. A signal cabin was relocated from the eastern end of the platform to the Bennett Brook Railway in 1985.\n\nThe station closed on 1 September 1979 along with the rest of the Fremantle line. Following much public outcry and a change of government, it re-opened on 29 July 1983.\n\nOpposite the station once lay an extensive yard. Today only a stabling siding and dual gauge freight line that is served by trains from Cockburn to the container terminal at North Quay remain.\n\nThe station features Donnybrook stone construction on the façade with red face brick infill panels on a Donnybrook stone plinth, in Federation Free Classical style featuring a rare example of a large train hall roof. The facade remained unpainted (except for metalwork and timberwork) until it was painted in 1950.\n\nThe station was classified by the National Trust in 1974 and entered into the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places in 2001. A rationalisation of the rail reserve in 2004 was part of a plan to revitalise the precinct. In 2005, a program of staged conservation and restoration works in line with a conservation plan prepared in 1999 commenced. This included paint removal and restoration of the main entry façade, refurbishment of most of the internal areas and an electrical upgrade to bring the station up to modern standards. In August 2011, the project was completed with the restoration of external facades of the station building.\n\nFremantle station featured in the 2006 film \"Last Train to Freo\".\n\nFremantle station is the terminus of Transperth's Fremantle line, with frequent services to Perth that continue through to Midland via the Midland line.\n\n"}

The show covers U.S. and international news, and provides arts and culture coverage.\n\n\"Here and Now\" has three cutaways for newscasts: one from :04:00 to :06:00 past the hour, occupying a portion of the national five-minute newscast from NPR, and two one-minute summaries of national news headlines at 0:18:00 and 0:38:00 past the hour, produced and anchored in-house at WBUR.\n\n\"Here and Now\" first began airing in 1998, when it was co-hosted by Tovia Smith and Bruce Gellerman. At the time, the show was billed as a local or regional current affairs show, concentrating on newsworthy events throughout the six New England states. The show expanded to include national and international elements, its current format, soon after.\n\nHost Robin Young joined the show in 2000, replacing Smith, and outlasted a series of co-hosts, including founding co-host and executive producer Gellerman. In 2005, WBUR had announced that the show would return to its roots as a local current affairs program, but a national distribution deal with PRI changed that plan.\n\nThe cancellation of NPR's midday newsmagazine \"Day to Day\" in March 2009 left a gap in public radio's programming day. News-heavy stations in some markets opted to pick up \"Here and Now\" as the replacement.\n\nBuilding on that philosophy, on March 29, 2013, NPR and WBUR announced that call-in show \"Talk of the Nation\" would cease production and NPR would replace it with a two-hour version of \"Here and Now\". The reported reason for the change was a desire of bigger NPR member stations to have a midday magazine-style news show acting as a bridge between network stalwarts \"Morning Edition\" and \"All Things Considered\". The expanded version of \"Here and Now\" debuted on July 1, 2013, with Jeremy Hobson as a second host. \n\nTanya Mosley became a co-host in 2019.\n\n"}

The mountain is situated in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park.\n\nAt above sea level, it is within the top thirty highest mountains in Tasmania.\n\nThe mountain lies east of the West Coast Range, yet due to its prominence, it can be seen from Macquarie Harbour. It lies south of the Lyell Highway from which it can be viewed from various locations, and south west of Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.\n\nThe peaks of the Frenchmans area include Frenchmans Cap (), Clytemnestra and Philps Peak (both ), and Philps Ridge ().\n\nThe mountain lies in the traditional lands of the Aboriginal Tasmanians, most likely the Toogee nation. The traditional names for Frenchmans Cap are trullenuer (trul.len.neur), toindy (toin.dy) or mebbelek.\n\nEven though the peak was an early landmark for ships sailing the west coast, the first recorded use of Frenchmans Cap was in 1822 in connection with Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, from where the peak was visible. The origin of the name is attributed to its appearance from some angles as looking like a Frenchman's cap, notably the Liberty cap worn during the French Revolution (1789–1799).\n\nA variation of that was reported by Henry Widdowson, who wrote in 1829 that the name was derived from \"its generally being covered with snow and bearing some resemblance to the shape of dress which invariably adorns the head of a French Cook\".\n\nThe distinctive shape of the mountain was used as a guiding beacon by many, largely unsuccessful, parties of escaping convicts as they attempted to struggle through the dense scrub of Western Tasmania to the settled districts further east. It was mentioned as a geographical reference in the account later dictated by convict Alexander Pearce to authorities, following his capture.\n\nThe earliest European recorded to have ascended was James Sprent and his trigonometrical party in 1853.\n\nIn 1941 the Frenchmans Cap National Park was created and its boundary was in effect the Franklin River. This park was subsumed into the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park in the 1990s.\n\nThe country around the mountain is invariably referred to by the books and the material written about the Franklin River. Johnson Dean's book gives a graphic account with maps and pictures the nature of the country.\n\nAccess to the mountain is usually via a multiday bushwalk from the Lyell Highway. Parks and Wildlife Service and other authorities in Tasmania give advice about the access and preparation needed – due to the changing conditions of the area.\nThe track is repeatedly overgrown, due to the vegetation and the rainfall of the area.\n\nThe walk to the peak along the well marked track typically takes two days. The first day of about will bring walkers to Lake Vera Hut. Water is plentiful (and drinkable) in all seasons. Walk time from Lyell Highway to Lake Vera is between six and eight hours. This part of the walk was historically very difficult, including two steep and prolonged ascents separated by the boggy Loddon Plains. The so-called \"Sodden Loddons\" were almost always muddy and crossing them took two hours or more. In wet weather the mud was frequently waist high, while in the dry it was only knee high. However, since 2013 track upgrades have seen the North Loddon Planes duckboarded, and the trail diverted around the South Loddon Plains through Philps Lead. This has allowed for significant environmental rejuvenation and reduced the difficulty of the first day. It was financed by donations from Dick Smith after he visited and was dismayed with the state of the trail.\n\nThe second day's walk is shorter at , but steeper. After walking along the shores of Lake Vera the next two hours are spent struggling up the steep inclines to Barron Pass. Once on top the walker is presented with a dramatic view of Frenchmans Cap. From Barron Pass it is approximately another two hours to Tahune Hut, depending on fitness and pack weight. Water is again available along the way. Walk time from Lake Vera to Lake Tahune is about four hours.\n\nThere are two lakes on the way to the summit – Lake Vera, and Lake Tahune – there are huts at both of these locations. Lake Vera Hut was built in 1979 and sleeps 20 people in two two-tier bunk configurations. It is heated by a stove using brickette fuel (similar to heat beads in BBQs).\n\nThe original Lake Tahune Hut was built in 1971 and slept 16 people snugly, also in two two-tier bunks and was heated by a brickette fuel stove. The hut was redeveloped in 2018, expanding it to sleep 24 people while adding deck room and an environmentally sustainable heater. At Tahune, the steep walker's track to the top of the Cap takes under an hour.\n\nIf the weather is clear the view includes the West Coast beaches, Lake Burbury and the many peaks – such as Tasmania's tallest, Mount Ossa – in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.\n\nThe plus walk to Frenchmans Cap is typically completed as a return trip on the same track.\n\nThere is an option to make it a round trip by walking on from Lake Tahune to the Franklin River at Irenabyss, crossing the river and exiting at Victoria Pass, which is also on the Lyell Highway. The walk from Irenabyss to Victoria Pass traverses rugged country and is recommended only for highly experienced parties. Many parties visit Irenabyss as a long day walk. Lake Tahune to Irenabyss takes about 4 hours. Irenabyss to Victoria Pass takes about 12 hours.\n\nFor climbers, Frenchmans Cap offers a variety of trad routes on generally sound, quartzite rock. In keeping with the name of the mountain some of these climbs also have French names including \"A Toi La Gloire\" (better known as The Sydney Route), a , 13-pitch, grade 17 climb on the south-east face and \"Tierry Le Fronde\", a , six-pitch, grade 16 climb on the Tahune Face.\n\nSerious climbing has occurred since the 1960s, as detailed in a 1990 article in \"Rock\" by Stephen Bunton. Jon Nermuts Tasmanian climbing page serves as the main information resource for routes on the main face as well as Gerry Narkowicz's description in \"Climb Tasmania\".\n\nFrank Hurley's black and white images from the 1950s which are in the National Library online collection, are probably the most evocative and easily accessible images close up of the features around Frenchmans Cap.\n\nBarry Maitland's 2008 mystery novel \"Bright Air\" contains a vivid description of a climb of Frenchmans Cap. It also features in \"For the Term of His Natural Life\" by Marcus Clarke and the non-fiction book \"Hell's Gates: The terrible journey of Alexander Pearce, Van Diemen's Land cannibal\" by Paul Collins (Hardie Grant, 2002). A more recent book is by Simon Kleinig in 2012.\n\n\n"}

Hayes (1880–1959) and Charlotte Gibson Hayes (1893–1977) in Charleston, West Virginia. She was in the class of 1948 at Calvin Coolidge High School. Hayes won the title of Miss District of Columbia. She represented D.C. in the 1949 Miss America pageant. Although she did not win the competition, it provided her with the opportunity to work in local television before moving to Hollywood to work for Universal Pictures in 1954.\n\nHayes made her film debut in the 1954 comedy \"Francis Joins the WACS\". Her second film, \"Sign of the Pagan\", provided her with an important role in a relatively minor film. Opposite Jack Palance, she played the part of a siren who ultimately kills him. Despite the strength of her second film role, she played minor roles in her next few films. Originally cast in \"Foxfire\" (1955), she was removed from the film during a lawsuit filed against Universal Pictures for injuries, including broken ribs, that she had sustained during the filming of \"Sign of the Pagan\". Released from her contract, she was signed by Columbia Pictures in 1955.\n\n\"Chicago Syndicate\", her first film for Columbia, Hayes played Joyce Kern - alias Sue Morton who seeks vengeance for the death of her father at the hand of local gangster Arnie Valent. \"Count Three and Pray\" gave her the role that she later described as the best of her career. Hayes played with Van Heflin, co-starring with Raymond Burr and Joanne Woodward in her debut. As an arrogant Southern belle, she was in love with Heflin, returning from the Civil War as a minister. After being spurned by him, Hayes is reduced to becoming Burr’s live-in \"housekeeper.\" Hayes had several well-played dramatic scenes. However, when the film was released much of the attention of reviewers was focused on Woodward, and Hayes was largely ignored. She appeared in films such as \"Steel Jungle\", \"Mohawk\", and \"Gunslinger\" (all 1956), but a fall from a horse during the filming of the latter left Hayes with a broken arm and unable to work. After she recovered, she began appearing in supporting roles in television productions. \nIn 1958, she played in several B movies, including \"Wolf Dog\" as well as taking the lead role in \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\", where she plays the part of an abused socialite who grows to giant size because of an alien encounter. In this film, she starred with Yvette Vickers and William Hudson, and it is probably her best-known role. With its science fiction storyline and low budget, the film attained popularity with some movie fans, and in the subsequent years has attracted a cult film following based primarily on Hayes spending almost all the time she’s enlarged calling for \"Harry!\" as she angrily searches for her philandering husband. The film did not lead to better roles, though she remained constantly employed and found work as a model. During 1963 and 1964, she played a continuing role in the \"General Hospital\" but by this time her movie career was virtually over.\n\nIn 1958, she appeared in the recurring role of Ellie Winters, beautiful poker dealer/secret agent, in seven episodes in the western series \"Bat Masterson\" starring Gene Barry. A close friend of Raymond Burr since filming \"Count Three and Pray\", she made five guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\" during this time, including the role of Pearl Chute in the 1962 episode \"The Case of the Bogus Books.\"\n\nAs her acting career declined, she began to experience severe health problems and was unable to walk without a cane. In severe pain, her usually good-natured personality began to change and she became emotional and volatile, making it difficult for her to secure acting work. She was given a minor role in the 1965 Elvis Presley film \"Tickle Me\", making her final appearances in a guest role on \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" in 1967.\n\nHayes later said that the pain of her illness caused her to contemplate suicide, and that her symptoms were not taken seriously by doctors. Reading a medical book about the metal poisoning of factory workers, Hayes recognized the symptoms described as being similar to her own. Hayes began to question the ingredients of a calcium supplement she had been taking for a long time and when she employed a toxicologist to test a sample of the product, he determined that it had an extremely high content of lead and concluded that Hayes was most likely suffering from lead poisoning. Hayes mounted a campaign to have the FDA ban the import or sale of the food supplement.\n\nAn invalid, Hayes moved to San Clemente, California and her health continued to deteriorate. In 1976, she was diagnosed with leukemia and was treated regularly in La Jolla, California. While at the hospital receiving a blood transfusion, her condition unexpectedly and rapidly deteriorated as she experienced chills, flu-like symptoms and intense pain. She was transferred to the University of California Medical Center in San Diego, California on February 26, 1977, where she died the following day, one week before her 47th birthday. Hayes was interred with her father at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Her mother Charlotte died eight months later and was buried in a nearby unmarked grave. In a letter that arrived after her death, the FDA advised her that amendments were being made to the laws governing the importation of nutritional supplements, largely as a result of her situation.\n\n"}

The agents from this heterogeneous group have an effect on the repolarization, they prolong the duration of the action potential and the refractory period. Also they slow down the spontaneous discharge frequency of automatic pacemakers by depressing the slope of diastolic depolarization. They shift the threshold towards zero or hyperpolarize the membrane potential. Although each agent has its own properties and will have thus a different function.\n\nAzimilide dihydrochloride is a chlorophenylfuranyl compound, which slows repolarization of the heart and prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Prolongation of atrial or ventricular repolarization can provide an anti-arrhythmic benefit in patients with heart rhythm disturbances, and this has been the primary interest in the clinical development azimilide. In rare cases, excessive prolongation of ventricular repolarization by azimilide can result in predisposition towards severe ventricular arrhythmias. Most recent clinical trials have investigated the use of azimilide in reducing the frequency and severity of arrhythmias in patients with implanted cardiac pacemakers-defibrillators, where rare pro-arrhythmic events are rescued by the device.\n\nThe action of azimilide is directed to the different currents present in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes.

The I(rapid)and I (slow) are inward rectifier potassium currents, responsible for repolarizing cardiac myocytes towards the end of the cardiac action potential. A somewhat higher concentration of azimilide is needed to block the IKs current. Both blockages result in an increase of the QT interval and a prolongation of atrial and ventricular refractory periods.\n\nAzimilide blocks hERG channels (which encode the I current) with an affinity comparable to that with which KvLQT1 / minK channels (which encode the I current) are blocked. This block exhibits reverse use-dependence, i.e. the channel blocking effect wanes at faster pulsing rates of the cell. A possible explanation is an interaction of azimilide with K close to its binding site in the ion channel. However, there is an agonist effect as well, which is a voltage-dependent effect. This is a dual effect, a low voltage depolarization near the activation threshold will increase the current amplitude and higher depolarizing voltages will suppress the current amplitude. The effect comes from outside of the cell membrane and does not depend on G-proteins or kinase activity inside the cell. Azimilide binds on the extracellular domain of the hERG channel, this propagates a conformational change and inhbits the current. This change makes the activation gate open more easily by low voltage depolarization. Azimilide has two separate binding sites in hERG channel, one for its antagonist function and the other for the agonist function.\n\nAzimilide has been studied for its anti-arrhythmic effects: its converts and maintains sinus rhythm in patients with atrial arrhythmias; and it reduces the frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators. Azimilide's most important adverse effect is torsades de pointes, which is a form of ventricular tachycardia.\n\nThe drug is administered orally and will be completely absorbed. It shows none or very minor interactions with other drugs and it will be eventually cleared by the kidney. A peak in concentration in the blood is observed seven hours after the administration of Azimilide. The metabolic clearance is mediated through several pathways:\nF-1292 is the major metabolite of azimilide, it is formed cleavage of the aromethine bond. Unlike desmethyl azimilide, azimilide N-oxide and azimilide carboxylate F-1292 has no cardiovascular activity while the other three minor metabolites have a class ΙΙΙ antiarrhythmic activity. They only make out 10% of azimilde in the blood, so their contribution is not measurable.\n\nThis use of azimilide is very controversial subject, but this article will give only the plain scientific information about this drug.\n\n"}

As of December 31, 2017, Aegon companies employed approximately 28,318 people worldwide, serving millions of customers. In 2020, the company had 26,000 employees. Aegon is listed on the Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. \n\nAegon was founded in 1983 from the merger of AGO Holding N.V. (created by the merger of Algemeene Friesche\", Groot-Noordhollandsche\" and Olveh\" (Onderlinge Verzekeringsmaatschappij Eigen Hulp) in 1968) and Ennia N.V. (formed by the merger of Eerste Nederlandsche\" and \"Nillmij\" (Nederlandsch-Indische Levensverzekering- en Lijfrente-Maatschappij) in 1969).\n\nAegon acquired Scottish Equitable in 1994. In 1998 it formed Stonebridge International Insurance Ltd to create and market a range of personal insurance products, providing accident, health and unemployment cover to its own customers and via business partners.\n\nIn 1999 it acquired the life assurance business of Guardian Royal Exchange. That year it also bought Transamerica Corporation.\n\nOn August 13, 2007, Aegon and Merrill Lynch announced a strategic business partnership in the areas of life insurance and investment products. As part of the relationship, Aegon acquired two of Merrill Lynch's life insurance companies for US$1.3 billion.\n\nOn April 23, 2008, Alex Wynaendts succeeded the retiring Donald J. Shepard as chairman of the executive board and CEO of Aegon N.V. following the group's annual general meeting of shareholders: Donald Shepard announced his retirement in November 2007, after six years as chairman.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, the Dutch government and De Nederlandsche Bank agreed to give Aegon a €3 billion capital injection to create a capital buffer in exchange for convertible bonds to ease the group through the financial crisis. On June 15, 2011, Aegon fulfilled its key objective of repurchasing all of the €3 billion core capital securities issued to the Dutch State. The total amount Aegon has paid to the Dutch State amounts to €4.1 billion. Of this amount, €3 billion covered the original issue of core capital securities, while an additional €1.1 billion was paid in premium and interest.\n\nOn August 3, 2011, Aegon USA announced that all its various businesses will be grouped under a single brand name: Transamerica. Transamerica's key businesses are life insurance, investments and retirement. The group includes companies whose history goes back over 100 years and whose products and services have become well known throughout the US, including founding companies Life Investors Insurance Company of America and Monumental Life Insurance Company.\n\nAegon's businesses focus on life insurance and pensions, savings and asset management products. The group is also active in accident and supplemental health insurance and general insurance, and has limited banking activities. Aegon has major operations in the United States (where it is heavily represented through World Financial Group and Transamerica), the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In addition, the group is present in a number of other countries including Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Turkey, Spain, China, Japan, North America and India.\n\nAegon's world headquarters are in The Hague, Netherlands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAEGON also operates a direct bank under the brand name \"Knab\" in the Netherlands. Soon after it was founded in 2012 the bank came under criticism for having the highest cost for any transaction account compared to other Dutch banks. Knab responded by saying that other banks hid many of its costs in other products.\n\nIn 2008, Aegon became the official sponsor of the Dutch football team AFC Ajax, in a deal which lasted for seven years. Ajax's uniform featured the Aegon logo across the chest. Aegon became the third sponsor of Ajax (TDK sponsored Ajax since 1982 until 1991, and ABN AMRO sponsored the team from 1991 till 2008). As of late 2008, Aegon also sponsor the Lawn Tennis Association. A sponsorship package was agreed with the LTA and Aegon's name will appear on all four pillars of British Tennis, including many professional tournaments, one of which is the AEGON Championships, an ATP grasscourt professional tennis tournament in June in London, taking over from Stella Artois, who had sponsored the event since 1979. Since 2004, Transamerica has been the primary sponsor of the American golfer Zach Johnson. AEGON is one of the strategic industry partners with Duisenberg school of finance.\n\nThe headquarters office of Aegon is located in The Hague and designed by OTH Architects. Initially AEGON wanted to redesign only the conference rooms, but while working on it they decided to improve and redesign the full building. The office spaces, the main hall and the restaurant were redesigned. The new design has a lot of glass like glass walls manufactured by SI-X. The restaurant has a main helical staircase with a full glass balustrade manufactured by Eestairs and did win the prize for the best staircase of the year in 2008. In 2009 Aegon decided to buy this building from real estate fund Unibail-Rodamco and keep the building as their headquarters.\n\nIn June 2018 AEGON was criticized by environmental organizations for its investments in tar sands oil companies and pipelines. Aegon reacted by stating that it was developing a new policy with regards to the oil and gas sector.\n\n"}

The sponsor of the program is American Honda Motor Company.\n\nThe program started in 1989 when Honda proposed a program to the College Bowl Company for HBCUs. To that end, College Bowl created a program in which all 4-year degree granting HBCUs are eligible to enroll teams, and all participating HBCUs receive grants. From 1990 to 1995, the competition format consisted of sectional matches that led up to televised National Championship games on BET (all of them hosted by Clint Holmes). The current basic format was adopted in 1996, which abandoned the sectional games and the televising of games in favor of an all-encompassing 64-team National Championship Tournament (NCT) held each spring. Since the 2010 season, only 48 teams have qualified each year.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2011, Honda Campus All Star Challenge used the same gameplay structure as two of its sister shows- College Bowl and University Challenge.\n\nGameplay takes place during two eight-minute halves and include toss-up and bonus questions. Toss-up questions are always 10 points in value and, and a correct response opn a toss-up gives the team the right to answer a bonus question, which can be worth 20, 25, or 30 possible points. The toss-up questions do not permit conferring with other team members, with buzzers (using a lockout system) being used to designate who rings in to answer a question. Players may ring in before the moderator has completed the question (also known as an interrupt) but if an incorrect answer is given, the team is given a five-point deduction, and the question is completed for the other team. \n\nTeams may confer on bonuses, but responses are only accepted from the captain (or a designated player if the captain chooses so). If team members have conflicting answers, then the captain will speak on behalf of the team. The bonus question may be one \"all or nothing\" question worth the full amount of the bonus, or may be a series of questions that give the team a chance to receive a portion of the maximum points (i.e. a 30-point bonus made up of three 10 point questions). Other bonuses may require a team to name items from a list at 5 points apiece, or award points based on how many clues it takes the team to identify a famous person, place, or thing (a 30-20-10 bonus). Only the team who answered the tossup correctly gets to answer the bonus question; there are no opportunities to \"rebound\".\n\nAt the end of two halves, the team with the higher score wins the game. If there is a tie, toss up questions are asked until there is a change in score (Either one team answers correctly for 10 points, or interrupts with an incorrect answer, losing 5 points and the game.)\n\nBeginning with the 2011–12 season, the format was changed to reflect that of the Zain Africa Challenge, another academic competition run by College Bowl.\n\nGameplay takes place over four rounds. The first three rounds are called Face Off Rounds. In each of the Face Off rounds, there are two types of questions: toss-ups, worth 10 points each and bonuses, worth 20 points. In each of the three Face Off rounds, a different player represents the team answering Face Off questions. That player is the only one who can ring in and answer for his or her team.\n\nEach round has four categories in play. The team who wins a coin toss decides the first category. After the entire question is read, the first player to signal gets to answer. If they answer correctly, the team gets a bonus question. If their answer is incorrect, the player representing the other team gets a chance to answer. Bonus questions come from the same category as their respective Face Off questions, are played by the entire team, and are always worth a possible 20 points. The team who answered the last correct tossup gets to choose the next category. In each category there are four face-off questions- once the fourth and final face-off question in a category is read, the category is out of play. At the beginning of Rounds 2 and 3, the face-off representative changes, and the team who is behind selects the category for the opening Face Off question.\n\nAt the end of the three face-off rounds, play moves to the fourth and final round, called the Ultimate Challenge. The team that's behind plays first, and selects one of four new categories. The team has 60 seconds to answer 10 questions, each worth 25 points. An incorrect answer is not penalized, but the moderator moves on to the next question, and as long as there is time remaining, teams can keep coming back to questions that they missed or passed on. After the trailing team plays, their opponents choose one of the three remaining categories to play. After both teams have played the Ultimate Challenge, the team in the lead wins. If there is a tie, the teams play Face Off questions until there is a change in score.\n\n\nAs part of a qualification process, each college/university must host a campus tournament to determine which players will represent the school's team. Schools must qualify for the NCT by competing in one of the National Qualifying Tournaments (NQT) that take place in February. 48 schools are chosen for the NCT based on their NQT performance and previous years' performance at the NCT. Schools may increase their chances of qualifying via other ways announced by HCASC officials, including service projects and \"Rep My School\" contests. Defending champions automatically qualify for the tournament.\n\nAfter the NQTs are completed, qualifying schools compete at the National Championship Tournament (NCT). Teams are placed into eight divisions and play every team in their division once. The divisions are named after famous Blacks, with two of the eight divisions renamed each year. The preliminary round consists of divisional round robin games. The two teams from each division with the best win/loss record move onto the round of 16 playoffs. Teams are seeded based on overall performance, and the \"sweet sixteen,\" \"elite eight,\" quarterfinal, and semifinal matches are single elimination, with the final two teams playing a best two-of-three series of final matches. Clint Holmes, who hosted the BET broadcasts, moderated the semifinal and final matches through 2008. Beginning in 2009, moderators from the Round Robin have been used during the on-stage games on the final game day.\n\nThe tournament begins with an opening banquet, and concludes with a closing banquet/awards ceremony. Both banquets include speakers and entertainers. Since 2004, the opening banquet has also introduced new members into the HCASC Hall of Fame.\nTournament format\n\nFor their efforts, schools that qualify for the NCT are awarded grants. The grant awards were updated for the 2015–16 season.\n\n\"Numbers in parentheses denote multiple championships\"\n"}

{"id": "2186521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186521", "title": "David Zdrilic", "text": "David Zdrilic\n\nDavid Allen Zdrilic (, ; born 13 April 1974) is an Australian soccer coach and former player, who is currently the assistant coach of Chicago Fire FC. Zdrilic is also a football presenter on the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), Most recently he was a key figure in SBS's coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\n\nZdrilic played on 30 occasions for the Australia national soccer team, having once scored eight goals in a single match – the second highest recorded for any Australian player, behind Socceroos teammate Archie Thompson, who scored 13 goals in the same game. He was also a member of the Australia national beach soccer team, the \"Beach Socceroos\", having captained the side. He previously played for Sydney FC in the A-League after forging a professional career in Switzerland, Germany, England and Scotland.\n\nAs a football presenter on the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), Zdrilic hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil which won a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Sport Coverage as well as SBS's Friday Night A-League coverage. He has hosted games from the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, various international cup competitions and the football entertainment show \"Thursday FC\" on SBS2.\n\nOver the last few years, Zdrilic combined various coaching roles in Australia with his media career before being announced as the new assistant coach of the under-17 team of German club RB Leipzig in July 2017. In his first year coaching in Germany, his team won both cup competitions and also the German Ost/Nord-Ost Bundesliga title. Following the successful year, Zdrilic moved up to the RB Leipzig U19 team which is the club's 2nd team (reserve team) feeding directly into the professional Bundesliga team.\n\nZdrilic represented his high school Patrician Brothers' College during his time as a teenage schoolboy and featured prominently in all teams including the A Grade squad. He had the opportunity as a child to pursue a tennis career, receiving coaching and playing in tournaments, but chose football instead. After playing through the youth ranks for St George Saints he broke into the senior side in 1993 at the age of 19. Mid-way through the NSW Super League year he signed to Sydney United for the coming National Soccer League season. He made an immediate impact shortly after joining the club, scoring four goals in four games in a preseason cup competition. However, he played most of his first NSL season playing as fullback, netting only once for the year. Zdrilic's versatility meant he was often used in different positions and during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 seasons, he was more often among the goal scorers. It was in the 1996/97 season that for the first time Zdrilic was used as an out and out striker and eventually took out the Golden Boot scoring 21 goals in 26 games. During this time he combined studied a law degree at Sydney University, working full-time at a Western Sydney Law Firm with his footballing duties. It was not until this 1996/97 NSL season that his footballing career rose to the next level.\n\nZdrilic's first call-up to the national team came in January 1997. After the appointment of Terry Venables as the new Socceroos coach, Australia hosted the \"Optus Cup\" a four-team tournament including an Australian squad of domestic-based players. In forming the squad, Venables had asked \"who's the leading scorer in the NSL?\", the answer being Zdrilic (having scored 12 goals in as many games), and he played all three matches. He continued his scoring ways in the NSL to win the Golden Boot for that season with 21 goals, United topping the table before losing the grand final to Brisbane. \n\nHis position atop the Australian league attracted attention in Europe, particularly in Switzerland with an offer to join Grasshoppers accepted, where he would initially be loaned out to FC Aarau. After a season at Aarau he moved to German side SSV Ulm 1846, newly promoted to the second division. Ulm's strong 1998–99 season with Zdrilic a regular starter and scoring 12 goals for the season saw them promoted again into the Bundesliga, the club's first appearance in the top flight.\n\nNow playing in a top European league, he earned a recall to national side in early 2000 for a tournament in Chile. Zdrilic was injured as a result of a bad tackle in the final minutes of Australia's game against Bulgaria and he returned to Ulm injured. He again rejoined the side in June as Australia hosted a three match series against Paraguay, which he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 win. Zdrilic remained with the side for the 2000 OFC Nations Cup, adding to his goal tally twice against Cook Islands.\n\nReturning to club duties, with Zdrilic out injured for much of the season due to the knee injury he sustained on international duty, Ulm had been relegated back to the second division and Zdrilic sought to remain in the top league. Despite the injury Zdrilic scored 6 goals in 13 Bundesliga starts for Ulm and moved to Unterhaching. The club struggled for consistency through the 2000–01 season and was eventually relegated, Zdrilic remaining with the club on its return to 2. Bundesliga. Haching continued to struggle for results in the 2001–02 season, relegated again at the end of the year. In contrast to club fortunes, Zdrilic was achieving greater success at international level throughout this time. Becoming a regular inclusion in an Australian side under Frank Farina, he was recalled for a friendly against Scotland to replace the injured Mark Viduka scoring in a memorable 2–0 victory at Hamden Park. He retained his place in the squad for the Oceania World Cup qualifiers. In Australia's second match of the tournament, he scored eight goals in a world record 31–0 win over American Samoa. He and his strike partner Archie Thompson, who scored 13 goals, broke the record for most goals scored in a senior international match. He remained in the team for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, taking part in the Socceroos memorable victories over Mexico and Brazil.\n\nWith Unterhaching in financial trouble, Zdrilic gained a release and signed on to English First Division side Walsall, where he was soon joined by fellow Australian Steve Corica. In a season restricted by a calf injury, he made 29 appearances in the league and cup scoring five goals including the only goal against Wimbledon F.C. in the FA Cup fourth round. In May 2003 he parted from the club and after interest from other English sides and Norwegian side S.K. Brann, he signed to Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen on a one-year deal, making an immediate impact with a goal 80 seconds into his debut in a pre-season friendly against Liverpool and then again against Rangers in the league. Zdrilic went on to score 8 goals in all competitions including the winner in a memorable win over Celtic which ended Celtics unbeaten home run of 78 games. After being linked with Belgian clubs Lierse S.K. and K.A.A. Gent, and also 1860 Munich, he returned to 2nd Bundesliga at Eintracht Trier.\n\nWhile facing difficulties at Aberdeen, his elevation back to the top flight of a European league returned him to national team contention. He was selected for a number of friendly matches and rejoined the squad in May for the 2004 OFC Nations Cup, which also doubled as qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. After a goal against Tahiti, he made two more appearances against Fiji and Vanuatu.\n\nHis stay at Trier was short-lived, and returned to Australia with the launch of the A-League in 2005 to be part of the inaugural Sydney FC squad, signing a three-year deal. Now back in Australia, he was included in a Socceroos side for a match on 29 March 2005 against Indonesia to benefit victims of the Boxing Day tsunami, scoring Australia's third goal in what many have tipped as his last international match. He took part in 19 of Sydney's matches in their first season, mostly as a substitute, scoring once. In the second season he found more game time under Terry Butcher, scoring four goals from 20 appearances.\n\nZdrilic remained at Sydney for the A-League 2007–08 season, in the final year of his original three-year contract. A number of matches saw him being deployed in the backline and midfield. Many Sydney FC fans became critical of his performances, after netting just five goals in his first two years at the club. Despite his clear intentions to add to his tally in the 2007–08 season, Zdrilic failed to score in any competitive matches all year and was released by Sydney at the end of the season. The end of his stay with Sydney FC effectively marked the end of his career.\n\nIn 2009, Zdrilic was approached by former teammate Ante Milicic to sign with his first professional club Sydney United, who play in the NSW Premier League. The team finished on the top of the table in the regular season but bowed out in semi-final. Zdrilic finished the season with eight goals and announced his decision to retire after 15 years as a professional footballer. \n\nDespite still playing at Sydney United, Zdrilic took up his first coaching role coaching with former NSL champions, Hakoah Sydney City East FC. In his maiden season as manager, Zdrilic guided the side to a semi-final berth but declined the club's offer to extend his contract for a second season.\n\nThe departure of Ante Milicic to A-League expansion club Melbourne Heart opened the opportunity for Zdrilic to become the player/manager at Sydney United. He spent one season in charge of the club before announcing his retirement as a player.\n\nDespite enjoying more success as manager - taking United deep into the finals series in his first season at Edensor Park - Zdrilic left the club to concentrate on his growing media career. He was succeeded at the club by Jean-Paul de Marigny, returning for his second stint in charge.\n\nWhilst away from the dugout, Zdrilic undertook a succession of coaching study tours in Europe, spending time at clubs such Bayern Munich, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nIn 2015, Zdrilic returned to the coaching ranks after being approached by Sydney FC to become the assistant coach of both the NSW NPL2 first team, NYL team and the under-20 side. Both sides won their respective leagues in August 2016, meaning the club will participate in the New South Wales NPL1 in 2017 for the first time. The following season saw Zdrilic take over the NPL1 U20 side as head coach whilst still remaining assistant coach to Robbie Stanton's NPL1 first team.\n\nIn July 2017, he accepted an offer from reigning Bundesliga runners-up RB Leipzig to become the assistant coach of the club's under-17 team, currently led by former VfB Stuttgart and TSG 1899 Hoffenheim striker Alexander Blessin. After a successful year with the U17's, the pair moved up to the U19's which is the club's reserve team feeding directly into the club's 1st team Bundesliga side.\n\n\"I spent a month at RB Leipzig last year on a study tour watching how they did things as well as learning from Ralf Rangnick and the other coaches,\" Zdrilic said. \"I highlighted that I would like the opportunity to one day move over to Europe to coach. They were aware of my role with Sydney FC and my previous coaching and playing experience which played a big part in Leipzig offering me the position.\"\n\n[[File:Harmony Day Pollies vs Professionals soccer match 28th February 2011 (5485103834)\nAfter being released from Sydney FC, Zdrilic started working as a football pundit for both [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[ESPN Australia|ESPN]], as well as featuring on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] and writing a column for [[mX (newspaper)|mX]]. He also took on a role as Player Relations Officer for [[Professional Footballers Australia]].\n\nZdrilic continued to work in the media and co-hosted the now-discontinued \"[[World Football News]]\" on [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]], and was a core part of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] coverage on SBS, appearing regularly as an analyst. He then joined SBS exclusively, which sees him continuing his analytical role, as well as co-hosting the football entertainment show \"[[Thursday FC]]\".\n\nZdrilic soon moved into the hosting role full-time and began presenting the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and International Cup Competitions. He then hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil which won a Logie for Most Outstanding Sports Coverage. He was also the host of SBS's 4 year coverage of the A-League between 2014 and 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Zdrilic was again a key figure in SBS's coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia where he presented live from matches around the country as well as expert analysis alongside Craig Foster and Lucy Zelic from SBS's Moscow studio.\n\nSince retiring, Zdrilic is a keen advocate for Beach Soccer and is a member of the Beach Socceroos. He has also captained the side. The Beach Socceroos travelled to Qatar in January 2013 for the Beach Soccer World Cup Qualifiers. Despite having no lead up practice matches and never before played together as a team, the Beach Socceroos narrowly missed out on a World Cup place finishing 4th out of 16 teams, only three World Cup spots were on offer.

The apolytikion summarizes the feast being celebrated that day. It is chanted at Vespers, Matins and the Divine Liturgy; and it is read at each of the Little Hours. The name derives from the fact that it is chanted for the first time before the dismissal (Greek: \"apolysis\") of Vespers. In the Orthodox Church, the liturgical day begins at sunset, so Vespers is the first service of the day. The term apolytikion is used in Greek tradition. In Slavic tradition the term troparion is specifically used to stand for Apolytikion,　whilst troparion is of more generic usage in Greek tradition.\n\nThe apolytikion could be compared in the Western liturgy to the collect or post-communion, inasmuch as it changes for each feast-day of the year and specifically commemorates the subject of the feast.\n\nThe apolytikion of the Feast of the Nativity (December 25):\n\n\"Your birth, O Christ our God, dawned the light of knowledge upon the earth. For by Your birth those who adored stars were taught by a star to worship You, the Sun of Justice, and to know You, Orient from on High. O Lord, glory to You.\" \n\nThe apolytikion for the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25):\n\n\"Today is the crowning of our salvation and the manifestation of the Mystery which is from eternity; the Son of God becometh the Son of the Virgin, and Gabriel announceth the glad tidings of grace: wherefore let us cry out with him to the Mother of God; Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee!\"\n\nThe apolytikion of Pascha (Easter):\n\"Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!\"\n\nThere are also Resurrectional Apolytikia written in each of the Eight Tones.\n\n"}

It is located on the Fremantle line, 12.4 kilometres from Perth station serving the suburbs of Cottesloe and Peppermint Grove.\n\nCottesloe station was originally established as Bullens Siding in 1884. Robert Napoleon Bullen was the proprietor of the Albion Hotel. The station was a request stop. Passengers could stop the train with a provided red flag in daylight or a candle in a jar at night. In June 1892 the station was renamed Cottesloe and became a regular stop for trains.\n\nThe station closed on 1 September 1979 along with the rest of the Fremantle line, re-opening on 29 July 1983 when services were restored. Cottesloe was previously the junction for a now lifted parallel freight line that ran to the Leighton Marshalling Yard.\n\nCottesloe station is located on the eastern edge of Cottesloe near the boundary with Peppermint Grove. The tracks lie between Curtin Avenue and Railway Street, two important roads in the area. There are two access points from each of these roads: At the southern end of the platform a pedestrian bridge provides access by stairs to the platform; those on the northern end of the platform require crossing the tracks at grade level to reach the platform.\nCottesloe station is served by Transperth Fremantle line services from Fremantle to Perth that continue through to Midland via the Midland line.\n\nCottesloe station had three platforms. During electrification of the line in 1991, the original northbound platform became southbound and the goods platform was converted for northbound services with the original southbound platform now disused. The goods line originally headed north to service the local Eureka flour mill. A graded grass corridor still marks the site of the track. There was once a manned signal cabin on the western end of the station.\n\nA regular bus service stops on the eastern side of the station. Bus route 102 operates at 30-minute intervals with Cottesloe station acting as its terminus.

{"id": "2186533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186533", "title": "Kuranda, Queensland", "text": "Kuranda, Queensland\n\nKuranda is a town and locality on the Atherton Tableland in the Shire of Mareeba, Far North Queensland, Australia. The town of Myola is also located within the locality of Kuranda (). It is from Cairns, via the Kuranda Range road. It is surrounded by tropical rainforest and adjacent to the Wet Tropics World Heritage listed Barron Gorge National Park. It is within the local government area of Shire of Mareeba (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Tablelands Region). In the , Kuranda had a population of 3,008 people.\n\nKuranda is positioned on the eastern edge of the Atherton Tableland where the Barron River begins a steep descent to its coastal floodplain. The area is an important wildlife corridor between the Daintree/Carbine Tableland area in the north and Lamb Range/Atherton Tableland in the south, two centres of biodiversity.\n\nParts of Kuranda, particularly along its eastern edge, are protected within the Kuranda National Park and Barron Gorge National Park. Both national parks belong to the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Barron Gorge Forest Reserve and Formatine Forest Reserve have been established in the south of Kuranda. Closer to the centre of the town is Jumrum Creek Conservation Park where a near threatened, endemic frog species is protected. An elongated dam created by a weir built for a power station was constructed in 1935 and is used to today for recreation.\n\nThe rainforest around Kuranda has been home to the Djabugay people for over 10,000 years. Europeans began to explore the area throughout the nineteenth century. It is believed a massacre of Aboriginal people took place at the location in Kuranda known as Skeleton Creek.\n\nThe name \"Kuranda\" is derived from Yindinji word, \"kuran\" referring to the acorn leafed plant (\"Helmholtzia acorifolia\").\n\nDjabugay (also knowen as Djabuganjdji, Tjupakai) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around the Kuranda Range and Barron River Catchment. The Djabugay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Cairns Regional Council.\n\nThe name \"Myola\" comes from its railway station, which was named on 15 December 1891 by the Queensland Railways Department using an Aboriginal word indicating \"main camp\" or \"elders' camp\".\n\nKuranda was first settled in 1885 and surveyed by Thomas Behan in 1888. Construction of the railway from Cairns to Myola (later Cairns to Herberton) began in 1887 and the line reached Kuranda in 1891. The current railway station was built in 1915.\n\nKuranda Post Office opened on 25 June 1891 (a Middle Crossing receiving office had been open from 1888).\n\nKuranda State School opened on 24 October 1892. It was renamed Kuranda District State School on 8 July 2002.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1913 Eric Mjöberg lead an expedition to Queensland in which the Kuranda Aboriginal people were observed.\n\nAlthough coffee was grown around Kuranda in the early twentieth century, timber was the town's primary industry for a number of years. Kuranda has been known as a tourist destination since the early 1900s. It was both the rainforest and local Aboriginal culture which attracted people to the area. Today Kuranda is a 'village in the rainforest' with tourism being the current backbone of the local economy. The 'village in the rainforest' concept promoted from the 1970s onwards served two purposes. It attracted those seeking a bohemian enclave in which to reside as well as a being a tourist promotional strategy. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Kuranda was popular with alternative lifestylers, a theme that still runs through the local community today.\n\nClohesy River Provisional School opened on 21 August 1933 and closed in 1939.\n\nThe Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station was built nearby in the 1960s.\n\nKuranda Library opened in 1996 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2015.\n\nKuranda State High School opened on 22 January 1998.\n\nIn 2007 Kuranda District State School and Kuranda State High School amalgamated to form Kuranda District State College.\n\nAt the 2011 census, the locality Kuranda had a population of 2,966.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,008 people in Kuranda.\n\nKuranda has a number of heritage-listed sites:\n\nMareeba Shire Council operate a public library in Kuranda at 18-22 Arara Street.\n\nThe Kuranda Historical Society was established in 2017 and seeks to collect and display items of historical interest relating to the Kuranda area.\n\nThe Kuranda Media Association publish a monthly newspaper called \"The Kuranda Paper\".\n\nThe Kuranda branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the CWA Hall on the corner of Barang Street and Thongon Street.\n\nKuranda District State College is a government primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at 260 Myola Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 366 students with 37 teachers (33 full-time equivalent) and 32 non-teaching staff (21 full-time equivalent). It has a special education program.\n\nCairns Hinterland Steiner School is a private primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at 46 Boyles Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 165 students with 18 teachers (17 full-time equivalent) and 17 non-teaching staff (11 full-time equivalent).\n\nThe nocturnal frog species \"Litoria myola\" is only found in the vicinity of a few creeks near Kuranda. The area boasts a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna including Australia's largest species of mantids, phasmids, spiders, moths and butterflies all found in Kuranda.\n\nBeing situated in the tropics, Kuranda experiences only mild variations in temperature and its seasons consist of a dry season and a wet season.\n\nKuranda does not seem to have a dedicated weather station and resultant data feed. It appears that phone and weather apps default to Cairns data and so can be misleading.\n\nGenerally Kuranda is 2–5 °C cooler than Cairns, it has more rainy days as a result of orographic influences, and it is more humid generally (with residential areas in Kuranda village averaging 90% relative humidity, because of the surrounding rain-forest). Kuranda is often referred to the \"air conditioned suburb of Cairns\" and the rain-forest and elevation is responsible in part for these perceptions. It is rare for the temperature to exceed 31 °C in summer, the weather being moderated by rain and cloud cover in January to March (the wet season), and night minimums at this time of year similarly rarely drop below 20 °C. Winter maximums (June to August) are typically a consistent 25 °C; however, minimums can drop to 8 °C, owing to clear skies at this time of year and cooler air movements originating from the southern Atherton Tablelands.\n\nKuranda is located in the (federal) Australian House of Representatives Division of Leichhardt, the Legislative Assembly of Queensland Electoral district of Barron River and locally, in the Shire of Mareeba.\n"}

Her master gave her in marriage to Yasir ibn Amir, who was from the Malik clan of the Madh'hij tribe in Yemen. After coming to Mecca to look for a lost brother, he had decided to settle there under Abu Hudhayfa's protection. Sumayyah gave birth to their son Ammar c.566. Yasir also had two brothers, Hurth and Abdullah, \n\nAt a later date, Abu Hudhayfa freed both Sumayyah and her son Ammar; but they remained his clients for the rest of his life. It is said that Abu Hudhayfa died \"before Islam\"; but it is also said that he was \"one of those who mocked the Prophet\".\n\nAccording to one tradition, Sumayyah was one of the first seven \"to display Islam,\" the other six being Muhammad, Abu Bakr, Bilal, Khabbab, Suhayb and her son Ammar. \"To display Islam\" might refer to something other than conversion since, according to another tradition, Ammar was not converted until after the Muslims had entered the house of al-Arqam \"after thirty men\". Yasir and his son Abdullah were also converted \"on the rise of Islam,\" but Hurth had been killed by the Dil clan before 610.\n\nThe Quraysh persecuted Muslims of low social rank. Sumayyah's family was vulnerable after the death of their patron, and it was other members of the Makhzum clan who tortured them to pressure them to abandon their faith. On one occasion she was put inside a pitcher full of water and lifted so that she could not escape. She, Yasir and Ammar were also forced to stand in the sun in the heat of the day dressed in mail-coats. \n\nAlthough described as \"a very old and frail woman,\" Sumayyah remained steadfast and refused to abandon Islam.\n\nOne evening Abu Jahl, also a member of the Makhzum clan, came to watch her standing there and he began to insult her verbally. Then he killed her by stabbing and impaling her with his spear.\n\nWhen Abu Jahl was killed at Badr, Muhammad said to Ammar, \"Allah has killed your mother's killer.\"\n\nTabari mentions an alternative account of Sumayyah's life. He says she married a Byzantine slave named Azraq after Yasir's death. She bore him a son named Salamah and their bloodline eventually married into the Umayyad family. Tabari also notes some stories as a case of possible confusion between two Meccan women named Sumayyah.\n\nThe earliest reference to the murder of Sumayyah is found in Ibn Ishaq's (died 761) biography of Muhammad, \"Siratu Rasulullah\" (\"\"Biography of the Messenger of God\"\"). Her name \"Sumayyah\" is not explicitly mentioned in Ibn Ishaq; it is a deduction from the reference to her son as \"Ammar \"son of\" Sumayya\". However, she is named as \"Sumayyah\" in the accounts of Ibn Saad and Tabari.\n\n"}
{"id": "2186541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186541", "title": "Ley de Lemas", "text": "Ley de Lemas\n\nLey de Lemas is the Spanish name of the double simultaneous voting (DSV) electoral system which is, or has been, used in elections in Argentina, Uruguay, and Honduras. It employs an unusual open party-list proportional representation system, and works as follows:\n\n\nThe \"Lemas\" system was designed in 1870 by the Belgian professor Charles Borelli.\n\n\"Lemas\" were introduced in Uruguay in the early 20th century when the \"\"Lema\" law\" introduced double simultaneous voting. It allowed for the election of the President, Chamber of Deputies and Senate by casting a single vote. Parties acted as \"lemas\", while party factions formed \"sublemas\". Voters would vote for a \"sublema\" of a party, with the totals of \"sublemas\" totalled to establish the winning party.\n\nDuring periods in which a presidential system was enacted (as opposed to the collegiado system that operated between 1918 and 1933 and 1951 and 1966), the presidential candidate of the \"sublema\" in the winning party with the most votes would become President.\n\nThis system was abolished for presidential elections after constitutional reforms were passed in a 1996 referendum, restricting each party to a single presidential candidate. Department elections still use the old system.\n\nThe parliamentary and department elections still use double simultaneous voting.\n\nHonduras applied the \"Ley de Lemas\" in the 1985 presidential election, when, due to factionalism within the two dominant parties, both were unable to elect a single presidential candidate.\n\nIn Argentina, a number of provinces employ or have employed a version of this electoral system. \nCurrently, this law is in the provinces of Formosa, Misiones and Santa Cruz. Provinces have complete freedom to elect local and national representatives using the method of their choice; the system propagates down to the municipal level (except in the hypothetical case of autonomous cities).\n\nThe \"lemas\" system has never been used in Argentina for a presidential election, though the idea was circulated before the 2003 election. In the wake of Fernando de la Rúa's resignation in the wake of the 2001 riots, original plans called for a permanent successor to be elected in 2002 under the \"lemas\" system.\n\nThe \"Ley de Lemas\" presents itself as a solution to the problem of fiat selection of candidates performed behind closed doors by party factions. By allowing many candidates to run within the same party and leaving the decision to the citizenry, the system is supposed to end the practice of dark intra-party alliances and add transparency to the conflicts between internal factions. This helps the participation of independent candidates without support from powerful party figures. It also avoids primary elections (which, in the case of Argentina, had never been practiced widely during the 20th century and typically enjoyed very low voter turnout).\n\nThe party-list proportional representation system works under the assumption that the citizens vote primarily for parties. However, citizens often place emphasis on individual candidates rather than the parties' perceived ideological platforms. (This is especially true of Argentina.) The diversity of views allowed within a single party means that voters may end up indirectly giving their vote to a candidate that the voters do not really support. A party that decides to present multiple candidates, either with similar or opposing ideologies, may win even if the elected candidate had few votes compared with all the other candidates. For example, in the 1971 Uruguayan presidential election, Juan Maria Bordaberry won the presidency despite finishing over 60,000 votes behind Wilson Ferreira Aldunate. However, in that election, candidates from Bordaberry's Colorado Party won 12,000 more votes between them than the candidates from Aldunate's National Party.\n\nAlso, proportional representation system are intended for multiple winnersfor example, candidates to fill a legislative chamberbut the \"Ley de Lemas\" has been used to elect single winners (presidents, governors and mayors).\n\n"}

The team currently fields two Holden ZB Commodores in the Supercars Championship for Bryce Fullwood and Chaz Mostert, along with a Porsche 911 GT3-R in the Australian GT Championship.\n\nFormed in 1990 as the Holden Racing Team, it is one of the most successful Supercars Championship teams in the history of the category, having won the drivers' championship six times, and the series' signature race, the Bathurst 1000, seven times. In 2017, the Holden Racing Team name was transferred by Holden to Triple Eight Race Engineering and the team was renamed Mobil 1 HSV Racing. For the 2018 season, the team was rebranded Walkinshaw Andretti United, as Andretti Autosport and United Autosports become shareholders.\n\nAs part of the joint venture established in 1987 between Tom Walkinshaw and Holden to form Holden Special Vehicles, Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) was to run Holden's motor sport programme. TWR were responsible for designing the Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV, which was homologated for racing in August 1988 after Holden Special Vehicles completed the required 500.\n\nFor 1988 it was decided to contract out the racing programme to Perkins Engineering although a car built by TWR in England was raced by Tom Walkinshaw at the RAC Tourist Trophy and Bathurst 1000.\n\nFor 1989 it was planned for TWR to run the full season with two cars. Win Percy and Neil Crompton were announced as the team's drivers and a second VL Commodore built in England was tested in Holden Racing Team livery at Calder but with the likelihood of being mauled by the Ford Sierra RS500s, the Australian Touring Car Championship programme was cancelled. For the Sandown 500, Bathurst 1000 and Grand Prix support races, the programme was once again contracted to Perkins Engineering.\n\nIn 1990 the operation was brought in house with longtime TWR driver Win Percy moving to Melbourne to fill the role of both driver and team manager. Percy drove at all Australian Touring Car Championship rounds except for Mallala where Neil Crompton drove after Percy returned to England for a family bereavement. Percy's highest qualifying position was sixth at Winton and highest race result a third place at Lakeside, and he finished eighth overall in the championship.\n\nAt the Sandown 500, Percy and Crompton qualified the car fourth, however did not finish the race. For the Bathurst 1000 the team entered two cars with Percy, against the wishes of Holden and Tom Walkinshaw, recruiting Allan Grice to co-drive the lead car. Crompton was joined by Brad Jones. With Percy suffering a shoulder injury, his decision to hire Grice was vindicated with the latter handling the bulk of the driving on the way to an unexpected victory, the second car finished fifth.\n\nFor 1991 the VN Commodore was homologated with Win Percy driving in all ATCC rounds except Lakeside where Allan Grice substituted while Percy competed in an event in Europe. Percy again finished eighth in the championship. At the Bathurst 1000, Percy and Grice teamed together to finish second, with the second car of Neil Crompton and Brad Jones not finishing after running out of fuel.\n\nWith Win Percy having decided to return to England, Tomas Mezera was hired. Due to a budget shortfall and the need to develop the VP Commodore for the new V8 formula, HRT only competed at the Sandown, Lakeside and Eastern Creek rounds. Two 1993 spec VP Commodores were raced at the Sandown 500 with Mezera and Brad Jones finishing third while Percy and Grice finished fifth at the Bathurst 1000. Mezera and Jones drove two cars at the Grand Prix support races.\n\nWith budget problems compounded by Castrol deciding to transfer its funding to Perkins Engineering, at the beginning of 1993 there was some doubt as to whether the team would compete in the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship. Former 1987 World 500cc champion Wayne Gardner with only one touring car start was signed as the team's driver with Tomas Mezera's participation being dependent on additional sponsorship being secured, however he would ultimately compete in all nine rounds.\n\nAt the Sandown 500 Mezera was joined by Michael Preston, with Brad Jones and Allan Grice in the second car. For the Bathurst 1000 Mezera was joined by Win Percy with Gardner and Jones driving the second car to a third-place finish. Gardner won a race at the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nThe team's season was dominated by off-track politics. Before the end of the championship chief engineer Wally Storey and team manager Neal Lowe had left the team with Mezera appointed as acting team manager. Before the Sandown 500, Gardner was suspended for two weeks from the team. HRT alleged Gardner was trying to poach the team's sponsors for his own operation, Gardner claimed that he was acting on a request by the team to help secure extra funding. Gardner secured funding from Coca-Cola for 1994, but his proposal for taking part ownership was rejected by Tom Walkinshaw and he elected to form Wayne Gardner Racing. At Bathurst, Jeff Grech commenced what would ultimately be a very successful stint as team manager.\n\nIn 1994 Peter Brock was signed to drive for the team. In spite of some resistance by some within Holden after the manufacturer's split with Brock's Holden Dealer Team in 1987, the substantial Mobil and NGK sponsorship he brought to the team made the deal irresistible. Both of these sponsors remain with the team in 2015. The team was competitive throughout the ATCC, with Brock taking the round win at Eastern Creek and second places at Sandown, Symmons Plains, Philip Island and Oran Park on the way to a third-place finish, Mezera finished ninth.\n\nBrock's win at Eastern Creek was the HRT's first ever ATCC round win.\n\nFor the endurance events, Brad Jones and Rickard Rydell (who was driving a Volvo 850 for TWR in the British Touring Car Championship) were earmarked to drive the second car. However, with Rydell's wife due to give birth, he was replaced by Craig Lowndes for the Sandown 500. After finishing fifth and setting the fastest lap of the four drivers, HRT elected to retain Lowndes for the Bathurst 1000. Despite Lowndes crashing in the warm up and spinning mid race, a stellar double stint from Jones saw the car finish second. The lead car crashed late in the race.\n\nFor 1995 the VR Commodore was introduced. Brock remained a championship contender at the final round at Oran Park, finishing third with Mezera fifth. Lowndes and Greg Murphy ran the second car at the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 however neither finished either race. After the Grand Prix support race it was announced that Lowndes would drive for the team full-time in 1996, he would take Mezera's seat for the season ending Brock Challenge at Calder.\n\nWith the demise of tobacco sponsorship, HRT had been able to lure many key personnel from Gibson Motorsport. This helped the team dominate the 1996 season with Craig Lowndes winning the ATCC, Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000, the latter two in partnership with Greg Murphy. Brock finished the series in fourth being joined again by Tomas Mezera for the endurance races. With Lowndes headed to Europe in 1997 to compete in F3000, Murphy was hired as his replacement and debuted at two races in New Zealand at the end of the year.\n\nThe year saw a number of mechanical failures with the VS Commodores that prevented HRT from following on from the success of 1996. One highlight of the year were one-two finishes at both Symmons Plains and Wanneroo. Just before the Eastern Creek round of the series, Brock announced his retirement from full-time racing. Overall, Murphy and Brock finished the year fourth and sixth respectively. Lowndes returned to drive in the endurance events with Murphy, while Mark Skaife co-drove with Brock. Lowndes and Murphy won the Sandown 500 while despite Skaife winning pole at both events, he and Brock failed to finish.\n\nAt selected events a third car was entered under the Holden Young Lions banner with Jason Bargwanna, Todd Kelly, Mark Noske and Stephen White driving. Bargwanna and Noske drove a car in the endurance races.\n\nFor 1998 Lowndes returned to HRT and Skaife succeeded Brock. With the Holden Young Lions program sub-contracted to Gibson Motorsport, HRT returned to a two-car team except for the Calder round where Greg Murphy debuted the VT Commodore. Lowndes won the ATCC with Skaife finishing third. Lowndes and Skaife finished second at the Sandown 500. At the Bathurst 1000 despite winning pole position and leading much of the race, Lowndes and Skaife suffered a number of tyre failures finishing sixth. The second car of Greg Murphy and Mark Noske suffered a crash in late qualifying causing them to miss the shootout and cause endless problems throughout the race including the same tyre woes that Lowndes and Skaife suffered and retired on lap 86.\n\nLowndes again won the ATCC with Skaife third despite Lowndes having to miss the Symmons Plains round after a car destroying rollover at Calder. Endurance driver Cameron McConville deputised in Lowndes's 1996 winning VS Commodore.\nFor the Queensland 500 and Bathurst 1000, Lowndes was joined by McConville finishing third and second respectively. Skaife was joined by Paul Morris finishing third at Bathurst.\n\nA third car was entered in the endurance races under the Holden Young Lions with Todd Kelly and Mark Noske driving.\n\nIn 2000 Skaife won the championship with Lowndes finishing in third. At the Queensland 500 Lowndes and Skaife teamed together to win. The second car was driven by Todd Kelly and Nathan Pretty, however failed to finish. At the Bathurst 1000, Lowndes and Skaife finished in sixth position with Jason Plato and Yvan Muller. Kelly raced the Holden Young Lions entry at some rounds being joined by Pretty at Bathurst.\n\nOff-track Craig Lowndes wanted out of his ten-year management contract with Tom Walkinshaw and left the team at season's end for Gibson Motorsport.\n\nIn 2001, TWR Australia expanded to become a four-car operation with the formation of the two-car K-Mart Racing Team. Because a team could only race three cars under a Racing Entitlement Contract (REC), Romano Racing's REC was leased for the two K-Mart cars with the Romano car entered as a third Holden Racing Team car under the Holden Young Lions banner. Jason Bright joined the team. At the Queensland 500 Skaife and Bright shared a car with Tony Longhurst and Tomas Mezera driving the second. For the Bathurst 1000 the lead drivers were split, Skaife and Longhurst winning. Skaife won the series, Bright finished third.\n\nIn 2002 Skaife again won the championship with Bright finishing fourth. HRT won the first eight rounds of the season. Jim Richards and Mezera drove the second car at the Queensland 500. At the Bathurst 1000 Skaife and Richards won with Bright and Mezera third. A third car was raced throughout the season under the Holden Young Lions banner by Rick Kelly, finishing fourth at Bathurst with Nathan Pretty.\n\nIn early 2003 Tom Walkinshaw Racing collapsed and the team was put up for sale by the administrator. Holden purchased the team, but because manufacturers were prohibited from owning teams, it was quickly sold to Mark Skaife. The K-Mart team was purchased by John and Margaret Kelly, continuing to be a customer of HRT until the end of 2008. Paul Weel Racing also became a HRT customer with Jason Bright moving to the team with Todd Kelly commencing a five-year stint as the driver of the second car. For the endurance races Jim Richards and Tony Longhurst rejoined the team. Skaife and Kelly won the Sandown 500 with Longhurst and Richards finishing in tenth. At the Bathurst 1000 Skaife and Kelly finished the race in eighth after being black flagged late in the race to repair accident damage with Richards and Longhurst fifth.\n\nIn 2004 Kelly finished the championship in seventh place and Skaife in twelfth after one of his worst seasons on record where it included a number of driver errors and reliability issues. For the endurance events Jason Plato joined Peter Brock in the second car. Skaife and Kelly finished the Bathurst 1000 in fourteenth position, two laps down after a belt from the engine broke early in the race.\n\nIn 2005 both Skaife and Kelly won rounds of the championship with Kelly winning the historic V8 Supercars China Round at Shanghai International Circuit. This victory gave HRT its 50th round win, the first team to do so. Skaife and Kelly won the Bathurst 1000. Jim Richards and James Courtney drove the second car, however failed to finish.\n\nIn 2006 Kelly finished the season in sixth place and Skaife finished in a miserable sixteenth. Both drivers did have success during with Skaife winning at Pukekohe and Wanneroo and Kelly winning at Surfers Paradise and Phillip Island. With HRT out of the title race by the time of the endurance races and the sister HSV Dealer Team having both its drivers in contention, it was controversially decided to split its drivers with Garth Tander driving with Skaife and Kelly with his brother Rick at the HSV Dealer Team. However the plan was not successful with the Skaife/Tander car finishing 26th at the Sandown 500 and crashing on lap 1 at Bathurst after a driveline failure. The second HRT car was driven by Jim Richards and Ryan Briscoe and finished in 21st at Sandown and did not finish at Bathurst.\n\nThe 2007 V8 Supercar season saw the debut of the new VE Commodore.\nSkaife finished sixth and Kelly seventh with post scoring race wins. Glenn Seton and Nathan Pretty were signed to drive the second car. However, with Skaife requiring appendix surgery the week before the Sandown 500, a reshuffle saw Kelly and Pretty paired in one car and Seton and Tony Longhurst in the second.\n\nIn 2008 defending champion Garth Tander engineer Matthew Nielson and sponsor Toll transferred from sister team HSV Dealer Team. For the endurance races Glenn Seton was joined by Craig Baird. On 29 October Skaife also announced that 2008 would be his last season in a full-time drive in V8 Supercars. At the end of the year, Skaife sold his 50% share in the team to Tom Walkinshaw.\n\nWith John and Margaret Kelly having elected to form their own team and use Perkins Engineering hardware, the team expanded to four cars in 2009, two entered under the HRT banner and two under the Walkinshaw Racing banner. One REC was purchased from WPS Racing and another was acquired from V8 Supercars Australia that had last been used by Romano Racing with Paul Dumbrell moving across with financial support from his family's Autobarn business while David Reynolds joined as the second driver with sponsorship from Bundaberg Red Rum. Dumbrell finished 15th in the championship at seasons end with several top-six finishes while Reynolds finished 22nd, showing pace and promise but no real results.\n\nAt HRT, Will Davison took Skaife's seat. Tander and Davison won the Bathurst 1000 with Davison finishing second in the series. HRT did win the team's championship.\n\nIn 2010, Fabian Coulthard and Andrew Thompson were signed to replace Dumbrell and Reynolds with Bundaberg Red sponsoring both cars.\n\nIn 2010 Tander finished fifth and Davison 22nd. As a whole, the team struggled to string together a series and ended a disappointing seventh in the team's championship. For the endurance races Tander was paired with Cameron McConville and Davison with David Reynolds. For the Bathurst 1000 the team ran a retro livery in recognition of the team's 1990 Bathurst victory.\n\nWith Will Davison departing for Ford Performance Racing, defending champion James Courtney joined the team. The season started with Courtney winning in Abu Dhabi. For the endurance races, Tander was joined by Nick Percat and Courtney by McConville. Tander and Percat won the Bathurst 1000. Tander finished the season fifth, Courtney tenth.\n\nOn the Walkinshaw Racing side, the team downsized to a single car for Coulthard with continued support from Bundaberg Rum, the race number was changed to No. 61.\n\nIn 2012 the team scored no wins with Tander finishing the season in seventh, Courtney tenth. Coulthard was replaced by Russell Ingall who brought Supercheap Auto sponsorship, the race number was also changed once again No. 66.\n\nThe VF Commodore made its debut in 2013. At the Townsville 400 Tander led a team one-two, breaking a 20-month drought for the team. Tander was again joined by Nick Percat for the endurance events, with Courtney joined by Greg Murphy. Tander also won a race at Phillip Island, James Courtney also won a race at Winton. Ingall and Supercheap Auto remained with the team in 2013.\n\nTander and Courtney again drove VF Commodores in 2014 with Warren Luff and Greg Murphy driving in the endurance races. Ingall was replaced by Tim Slade and the car entered as No. 47. The team expanded to a four car operation with a customer car fielded for James Rosenberg Racing with Nick Percat driving. Adrian Burgess joined as team manager.\n\nThe full-time driver lineup was maintained for 2015. Jack Perkins replaced the retiring Greg Murphy for the endurance races and also substituted for Courtney at a few rounds after the latter was injured. Russell Ingall joined Perkins at the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000. With James Rosenberg Racing returning its REC to V8 Supercars at the end of 2014, a customer car was fielded for Charlie Schwerkolt Racing with Lee Holdsworth driving.\n\nWith Supercheap Auto taking its sponsorship to Prodrive Racing Australia, the team downsized to two cars, the two Holden Racing Team entries. The third REC was sold to Super Black Racing while Charlie Schwerkolt Racing became a stand-alone team. Tander and Luff won the Sandown 500.\n\nIn 2017 the team lost its Holden factory backing to Triple Eight Race Engineering, but continued to field two VF Commodores under the Mobil 1 HSV Racing banner. Scott Pye replaced Tander.\n\nThe team was rebranded as Walkinshaw Andretti United in January 2018, with Andretti Autosport and United Autosports becoming 37.5% and 25% shareholders respectively in the team. Walkinshaw and Andretti now hold equal ownership with United Autosports as minority partner. All Holden teams, including Walkinshaw Andretti United, upgraded their entries to the new Holden ZB Commodore for the 2018 season. The team raced under the Mobil 1 Boost Mobile Racing banner, with Courtney's number changed to No. 25, in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the team and Mobil 1's partnership.\n\nHighlights for the team during 2018 were the team scoring one win, courtesy of Scott Pye in challenging conditions at the Melbourne 400. The win was also Pye's first in the category. A second placing at Bathurst for the second year in a row and moving up to 5th in the teams championship.\n\nWAU continued to field two ZB Commodores for Scott Pye and James Courtney, with Courtney reverting to running the teams traditional racing number of 22. Mega Fuels came in as the new main sponsor to the team, replacing Boost Mobile, which went to Garry Rogers Motorsport. They are currently enduring a difficult season, with the team only having a single Top 5 result, coming from James Courtney at the first race at Winton Motor Raceway, and currently sitting 7th in the Teams Championship. On 27 August, James Courtney announced that he will be leaving the team, after nine years with the team. On 3 September, their main sponsor, Mega Fuels, went into receivership, making Mobil 1 their primary sponsor at Pukekohe and Winning Appliances and Appliances Online for #2 and #22 respectively from Bathurst onwards.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, a battle erupted over the ownership of HRT. Skaife had been hounded by governing body, the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA), for more than four months for paperwork proving compliance with the Teams' Licence Agreement, but had failed to show the required information. He was given until 12 March to provide the evidence, or the team could be removed from the V8 Touring Car Competition.\n\nSkaife managed to produce sufficient evidence and TEGA allowed HRT to continue racing. A commercial settlement was struck between Skaife and TEGA that ensured that Skaife, and not Holden Motor Sport owner Tom Walkinshaw, had ownership and control over the team. It has been revealed that Tom Walkinshaw owned a 50% stake in Skaife Sports. Subsequently, in December 2008 Skaife sold his remaining interest in HRT to Walkinshaw.\n\nSince 2016, Walkinshaw Andretti United has entered the Australian GT Championship with a factory backed Porsche 911 GT3 R driven by John Martin and later Laim Talbot. Talbot moved to Porsche Carrera Cup Australia in 2019 and the GT team was shut down.\n\nThe following is a list of drivers who have driven for the team in Supercars, in order of their first appearance. Drivers who only drove for the team on a part-time basis are listed in \"italics\".\n\n"}

Pure stands of Dinaric calcareous Silver fir (\"Abies alba\") forests appear on limestone escarpments in the montane zones of Orjen, Velebit, Biokovo and Prenj. They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests bear several rare plants and are of striking beauty. As a highly endemic and rare vegetation type of the Dinarids it needs protection. \n\nDinaric calcareous silver fir forests have an open structure which is environmentally sensible.

Silver firs can reach up to on the limestones and trunk diameters of have been observed.\n\nDinaric calcareous silver fir forests are dispersed in smaller patches on the hypercarstic litoral karst mountain environments of the Dinarids. Prominent are those on Velebit and Orjen, appearing on bare limestone escarpments in the montane lifezone between . The abundance of precipitation on these coastal mountains of up to 5000 mm/m²a with the dry soil conditions restricts these pure silver fir forests to the most rainy and humid spots of the Dinarids.\n\nSilver fir is a constituent of montane central European forests. As a rare species in dry climates of the Mediterranean, the silver firs presence on Mt. Orjen is restricted to humid northern slopes. A marked difference in the fir's vegetation patterns is seen here. It has a common cause in soil formation. High soil-water content in terrae fuscae on glacial superstratum leads to beech-fir forests.

{"id": "2186594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186594", "title": "Steve Roach (rugby league)", "text": "Steve Roach (rugby league)\n\nStephen David Roach (born 24 April 1962), nicknamed Blocker or Blocker Roach, is an Australian former professional rugby league who played as a prop forward in the 1980s and early 1990s. \n\nHe made thirty-nine representative appearances for the Australian national team in Tests, World Cup and New South Wales State of Origin matches between 1985 and 1991. His football career was followed by a period as a commentator.\n\nRoach was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nAlthough born in Sydney, Roach played his early rugby league for Wests Illawarra and was signed by the Balmain Tigers in 1982. He quickly advanced to first grade and in 1983 was part of the Balmain side which made the semi-finals for the first time since 1977. Between then and 1992 Roach played 185 first grade games for the Tigers. 1987 was almost completely wiped out for Roach due to a serious knee injury and though he returned to excellent form in 1988 he was cited for a tackle on Penrith's Chris Mortimer suspended for four weeks, missing the 1988 finals including the Grand Final loss to Canterbury. \n\nIn the 1989 club season his combination with Paul Sironen, Benny Elias and Wayne Pearce was one of the strongest packs in club rugby league history and the side dominated opposing forwards. In the 1989 Grand Final, after having led Canberra 12 points to 2 at half-time, the Tigers were run down. Roach and Sironen were replaced by coach Warren Ryan late in the 2nd half and when the game ultimately went into extra time they were unable to return and with their strikepower gone in the added period Canberra were able to overpower Balmain 19-14. In 1991 his club form showed some decline but he again managed national selection and his experience was vital to the improvement of a side needing reorganisation after they suffered a shocking start to the club season. After an ankle injury in 1991 he was also troubled by a knee injury in 1992 which would prove to be his last club season. \n\nState representative honours first came his way in 1984 when he was called into the New South Wales Blues side for all three games of that year's State of Origin series. Thereafter barring injury (which ruled him out of the 1987 series) and his surprise omission in 1989 (which saw NSW suffer their second straight 3-0 defeat by Queensland), he was generally a regular Blues starter and he made 17 State of Origin appearances until Game 2 of the 1991 series. When Jack Gibson was New South Wales coach in 1989 and 1990, he reportedly threatened the NSWRL with resignation from the position if Roach was selected in the side, though the Balmain front rower was selected in 1990 and went on to win their first series since their 3-0 win in 1986.\n\nIn 1985, Roach became the 562nd player to represent Australia when he made his national representative début in the first Test in Brisbane against New Zealand. His excellent club form for Balmain in 1986 ensured his place on the 1986 Kangaroo tour where he appeared in two Tests and seven minor tour matches, though his tour was interrupted after he suffered a dislocated elbow in a match against St. Helens before the second Ashes test against Great Britain.\n\nCitations and despatches to the sin-bin in the 1989 club season may have contributed to his omission by State selectors from the Blues squad of that year however powerful club performances with his fellow representative Balmain forwards made him a certainty for the 1989 New Zealand tour where he played in all three Tests. On the 1990 Kangaroo tour Roach played in all five Tests against Great Britain and France and in five other minor tour games. In a Test match against New Zealand in Melbourne in 1991, Roach clashed famously with Kiwi forward Dean Lonergan and required 20 stitches. Early in the game the Kiwi forward had attempted a tackle on Roach but the pair accidentally clashed heads, leaving Roach requiring stitches and Lonergan convulsing on the ground, though both would return to the game.\n\nBlocker was dropped after the Australian's shock 24-8 loss to NZ in the Melbourne test but was chosen for the end of season tour of Papua New Guinea.. However, Roach suffered a broken ankle in the first match of the tour which would prove to be his last appearance in any game for the Kangaroos\n\nIn a game in 1990 against Manly at Brookvale Oval he received a four-week suspension for backchatting the referee Eddie Ward, whom Roach patted on the head after he was ordered from the field. Coming into physical contact with a referee is regarded as a serious offence and Roach was fortunate that no further action was taken. Roach did himself no favours in this incident when he gave the touch judge a verbal bashing on his way off the field.\n\nBy the end of the 1992 season Roach had written an autobiography, \"Doing My Block\" and he became a commentator with the Nine Network as well as making appearances on \"The NRL Footy Show\". After a disagreement with fellow Channel 9 commentators Paul Vautin and Peter Sterling he was sacked by the network and signed by the official rugby league radio broadcaster 2UE, before later moving to 2GB with Ray Hadley and his Continuous Call Team. He has made further television appearances on the Seven Network's \"Sportsworld\" and is one of a number of former players who appear in radio, TV and print ads for the Lowes menswear chain. After a 3-year stint as assistant coach with Manly, Roach was appointed to the coaching committee of his beloved Tigers - now the Wests Tigers. \n\nOn 23 June 2000, Roach was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league.\n\nIn February 2008, Steve Roach was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\n\nIn 2011 Roach joined Network Ten's new Thursday night Rugby League show \"The Game Plan\".\n\nIn 2014, Roach was sacked by 2GB after a staff member filed a bullying complaint against him.\n\nIn 2016 he made a comeback to the Rugby League commentary box signing on with Fox Sports.\n\nIn 2018, Roach revealed that his nickname ‘Blocker’ actually came from his time employed as a Licensed Plumber where it was remarked by his colleagues that he would ‘block’ pipes that would subsequently require plumbing works to be conducted.\n\nIn 2019, he appeared regularly on Fox Sports panel show, 'Controversy Corner', as well as commentating for the network.\n\n\n"}

In terms of population it is the largest village in Rutland, and the third-largest settlement after Oakham and Uppingham. This is due in part to the presence of Kendrew Barracks (formerly RAF Cottesmore).\n\nAt the time of Edward the Confessor (mid 11th century), \"Manors Cottesmore\" was held, together with Greetham, by Saxon called Goda. Goda held 12 carucates of land, three of which were held in tax to the Danegeld. The King held three carucates in demesne and three socmen with 40 villeins and six bordarii held 20 carucates. Of the land held by the manor, one Goisfridus held half a carucate; he had one plough and eight villeins. Cottesmore also had of meadow and a wood measuring a mile in length by seven furlongs in breadth.\n\nSt Nicholas' Church, Cottesmore is a Grade II* listed building. The north aisle forms a RAF chapel, dedicated in 1949 to those who gave their lives while serving at RAF Cottesmore. A stained glass window was erected to the memory of Major General George Williams Knox CB (1838 - 1894).

It was written by the band's lead singer Gwen Stefani and David Stewart. The song features a reggae production from Sly and Robbie and guest vocals from Lady Saw. The song received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics.\n\n\"Underneath It All\" was released as the album's third single in mid-2002. It became No Doubt's highest-charting US single, but was less successful elsewhere. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 46th Grammy Awards. The song was featured in the 2004 film \"50 First Dates\".\n\nThe song was originally written by Gwen Stefani and David Stewart during Stefani's visit to boyfriend Gavin Rossdale in London. The two used backward string samples to write the song in only ten minutes. The song describes Stefani's relationship with Rossdale, and the line \"You're really lovely underneath it all\" comes from a journal entry that Stefani made after spending a day in the park with Rossdale. The band's guitarist Tom Dumont commented that Stewart's experience helped them keep the song simple because he \"would have way overthought those chord changes.\" When the band was working on the album in Jamaica, producers Sly and Robbie called Lady Saw to have her contribute a guest toast. After listening to the song, Lady Saw wrote and recorded her part on the spot.\n\nThe song is a love song composed in the key of E major. It is written in common time and moves slowly at 69 beats per minute. Stefani avoids the heavy vocal vibrato that she often uses. Her vocal range spans under an octave and a half during the song, from F# to B.\n\nThe song opens with a line sampled from Bob Clarke's Sunday radio show on IRIE FM. The verses use a simple I-vi chord progression, alternating between a first inversion E major chord and a second inversion C# minor chord, played on the off-beats and switch to a IV-iii progression. Each verse is followed by the chorus, which uses a I-IV-V-IV progression. After the bridge, Lady Saw performs her toast. Stefani then sings the chorus twice, and Clarke closes the song after Stefani repeats the line \"Mm mm mm underneath it all\" four times.\n\n\"Underneath It All\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. \"Rolling Stone\" found its ska sound and Stefani's questioning whether or not Rossdale is her soulmate tired. LAUNCHcast agreed the beat was one \"that Sly & Robbie can do in their sleep\" but added that the song \"keeps its modern edge thanks to Lady Saw's cooling rap.\" Kitty Empire writing in \"NME\" also gave Lady Saw's toast a positive review, stating that it \"does an excellent job of sexing up all the sugar.\" \"Stylus Magazine\" was pleased with Stefani's performance on the song, stating that \"she lets her voice ride gently on top of the melody, pushed along by the gentle steel drums in the background.\" \"PopMatters\" commented that \"No Doubt isn't afraid of working with new ideas\" but that the dancehall of \"Underneath It All\" was unsuccessful and sloppy. In its review of \"The Singles 1992-2003\", OMH Media described the song as \"an embarrassingly self-conscious reggae pastiche, unimproved by a guest rap from Jamaican dancehall queen Lady Saw.\"\n\n\"Underneath It All\" peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming No Doubt's highest charting US single, since \"Don't Speak\" was not allowed onto the Hot 100 because of a technicality. It was successful in mainstream music, topping the Top 40 Mainstream and reaching number two on the Top 40 Tracks. The single was also successful in the adult contemporary radio market, reaching number two on the Adult Top 40 chart with a 2004 re-appearance atop the Top 40 Adult Recurrents and peaking at number 27 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It had some crossover success on urban contemporary and Hispanic rhythmic stations, reaching the top 40 on the Latin Pop Airplay and Rhythmic Top 40 charts, and number 23 on the Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay. The single fared poorer on the Canadian Singles Chart, where it peaked at number 35.\n\n\"Underneath It All\" debuted at number 18 on the UK Singles chart but was unable to reach a higher position. It was unsuccessful across Europe, only reaching the top 40 in Austria and Sweden. On the ARIA Charts, the single peaked at number 28 and remained on the chart for seven weeks. In New Zealand, the single peaked at number eight for two consecutive weeks and stayed on the chart for over four months.\n\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by Sophie Muller and directing collaborative Logan. It opens with a sequence of Stefani, as shown on the cover of the single, removing several pieces of clothing and later lying on a bed. After a scene with her in front of a white heart with roses, bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young play basketball while Stefani stands against the wall. Stefani is then shown against a sparkling sky, followed by a scene of the whole band bicycling during Lady Saw's toast. The video closes with a scene of Stefani jumping on a bed in white undergarments and without makeup.\n\nMuller wanted to add more sexual themes to the look of the video to contrast with the innocence of the song's lyrics. The original idea for the video was to show Stefani with heavy makeup \"really over done like a stripper\" and have her remove her clothing throughout the video. Muller found that this complicated the video too much, so each sequence shows Stefani with progressively less makeup instead. Muller decided to use a color scheme with bright colors such as orange, lime green and pink, and the contrast was increased using Symphony in post-production. The bicycling scene was to originally show footage that the band shot while recording in Jamaica since Stefani wanted to include a Jamaican theme. Instead, the scene was created by filming the individual band members on a twelve-foot turntable in front of a bluescreen. Tracks were used to shoot two members riding next to each other and Logan used computer-generated imagery to show the entire band bicycling in Jamaica.\n\nThe video was successful on video channels. It debuted on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" October 7, 2002 at number seven. It reached number five on the countdown and was on the program for twenty-four days. \"Underneath It All\" peaked at number two on MuchMusic's \"Countdown\" in September 2002. The video received nominations for Best Pop Video and Best Cinematography at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\" and Johnny Cash's cover of \"Hurt\" respectively.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Australia the group was called \"British Jigsaw\" due to the existence of a local band of the same name.\n\nFormed as a six-piece band of musicians in Coventry and Rugby by Tony Campbell in April 1966, they scored a number of hit singles around the world, and released thirteen albums. The group was partly influenced by fellow British musicians The Beatles, at times sounding Beatlesesque, especially their ballads, which show leanings towards Paul McCartney's musical and vocal arrangements.\n\nThe original line-up consisted of Dave \"Biffo\" Beech (vocals and drums) (born David Beech, 25 September 1945, in Rugby, Warwickshire, died 7 June 2007); Clive Scott (keyboards and vocals) (born Clive Kenneth Scott, 24 February 1945, in Coventry, died 10 May 2009); Barrie Bernard (bass guitar) (born 27 November 1944, in Coventry); Tony Campbell (guitar) (born Anthony Campbell, 24 June 1944, in Rugby); Tony Britnell (saxophone) and Kevin \"Beppy\" Mahon (tenor saxophone). Biffo left in the first year, and was replaced by Des Dyer (drums) (born Desmond Roy Dyer, 22 May 1948, in Rugby), who took over lead vocals.\n\nScott had been in Scott and The Antarctics; Dyer had played in The Surfcyders and Clockwork Shoppe; Campbell, Mahon and Beech had worked together in The Mighty Avengers; and Bernard had been a member of Pinkerton's Assorted Colours, whilst Britnell had worked with The Fortunes.\n\nCampbell named the band after a Manchester nightclub called \"The Jigsaw Club\", but the way that he 'pieced together' the band from other members of existing groups also gave added aptness to the name.\n\nIn 1970, the group were given the opportunity of turning fully professional by being the backing band for Arthur Conley, on his European tour. Most of the band did so, but Kevin Mahon decided to keep his day job and left the band. In 1974, Tony Britnell became seriously ill and left the band. After his recuperation he became a member of The Sunsets, the backing band for Shakin' Stevens.\n\nOn stage, Jigsaw were a wild rock band who had a high energy live show; drum kits were set on fire, explosions were set off as an effect, Tony Britnell performed fire eating and Clive Scott would make his Marshall stack explode and disintegrate. However, during the early 1970s they began writing and recording more mainstream pop.\n\nJigsaw's arrangement of the Johann Sebastian Bach tune, \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\" was featured on their 1970 debut album \"Letherslade Farm\".\n\nThe group give credit to their producer and manager, Chas Peate, for inspiration to get songs completed. As Jigsaw toured a lot, Scott and Dyer would write snippets of songs separately in their spare time, but, as Dyer said in an interview in the 1990s, \"it was Chas who would say we're recording an album soon, you'll need 10 songs by then\". The two would then combine their work together for the planned recording sessions.\n\nAs songwriters, the duo had a hit song with \"Who Do You Think You Are\", which was covered by the UK band Candlewick Green in 1974. The song was further covered in the U.S. by Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods (this version made the U.S. charts), and again in 1993 by Saint Etienne. The song was also on Jigsaw's 1974 album \"I’ve Seen The Film, I’ve Read The Book\". However, the band's own single from the album \"You’re Not The Only Girl\" was not a chart success. Early in 1975, the single \"Baby Don't Do It\" received heavy airplay on the UK service of Radio Luxembourg, but the record was not a hit and the band were soon dropped by their recording label, BASF.\nWanting to carry on, the group continued to make music and signed a new deal with independent UK label Splash, which was founded by Chas Peate himself. Their first single for their new label, titled \"Sky High\", was recorded for the film \"The Man from Hong Kong\", a 1975 martial-arts action movie starring George Lazenby. Splash pressed a couple of hundred promotional copies and reaction to the song was good, especially from Radio Luxembourg which began playing the song with high rotation during its nightly English pop music broadcasts to the UK. \"Sky High\" subsequently made the UK Top 10 in November 1975. The recording was licensed to Chelsea Records in the United States where it reached #3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and to #2 Adult Contemporary. The song was also #1 in Japan. A famous Mexican wrestler, Mil Máscaras, used \"Sky High\" as his theme tune. He would walk to the ring with the song playing in the background, and his popularity in Japan helped \"Sky High\" to become a hit twice over in that country in consecutive years.\n\nThe \"Sky High\" album also sold well too, especially in Japan. The next single \"Love Fire\" was another hit, although not in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, \"Love Fire\" was followed by two new albums, one for the British market called \"Pieces of Magic\" and another for the American market simply named, \"Jigsaw\".\n\nIn 1977, the band recorded an album \"Journey into Space\" in Los Angeles. Years later, Clive Scott revealed in an interview that the record label 20th Century Records paid for the band to fly out to make the album, paid for their accommodation, and gave them cash advances (or, as Scott called it, \"pocket money\") to live off for three months while making the record. The album was produced by Rick Jarrard who was the producer of Jose Feliciano and the person responsible for putting together Elvis Presley's Las Vegas band. However, the album was never released outside of Japan, much to the frustration of the group.\n\nJigsaw returned to Britain and scored another hit with the single \"If I Have To Go Away\", after which they recorded ten original songs for the film \"Home Before Midnight\", which were later released on a soundtrack album of the same name.\n\nBernard left the band in 1978 and was replaced by Jon Fox. Campbell also left the band in 1979 and was replaced by Rod Godwin. The band ceased touring in 1981 but Scott and Dyer continued to record using Tim Stone on guitar and Pete Dennis on bass. This new group lineup recorded one album for Elektra. The album, a disco influenced set (that was never released in the United Kingdom) was issued in the United States the following year. A final single under the Jigsaw name was released by Splash in early 1983 called \"Love Isn't at Home\".\n\nFollowing the group split, Scott and Dyer continued to be successful songwriters, having their work recorded by Nicki French, Bad Boys Inc, Boyzone, Jon Otis, Bobby Rydell, and many others. After leaving his music career behind when he quit Jigsaw in 1979, Tony Campbell went back to his first occupation, ophthalmic engineering. He had a family. One of his daughters created and manages the Royal Academy of Dance dance school in Rugby, Warwickshire. Barrie Bernard continued to work in the entertainment business, running night clubs and being an active magician. Though no new studio albums have been issued, eight newly recorded songs were included on a 1995 compilation CD, entitled \"The Best of Jigsaw\", just one of the collections of their music released. Dyer has twice attempted to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest, taking part in the 1983 and 1985 A Song For Europe competitions. In 1983, he placed third as lead singer of the group Casablanca with the song \"With Love\". Two years later, as a soloist, he took \"Energy\" to fourth place. The song from 1985, \"Energy\", was reworked to become the album track \"Voice of America\" and sung by Nicki French for her first studio album \"Secrets\". In 1988, Dyer provided backing vocals at the Eurovision final alongside Julie Forsyth and Dominic Grant, both formerly of Guys 'n' Dolls, for the UK entry performed by Scott Fitzgerald, \"Go\". This song placed second in the contest held in Dublin on 30 April. The UK lost by one point to Celine Dion, representing Switzerland with \"Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi\" (Don't Leave Without Me).\n\nMuch has also been made about their lack of success in the UK charts, where only two of their singles made the Top 40. It has been suggested this was because BBC Radio 1, the most popular station in the UK at the time, gave little or no airplay to their singles after \"Sky High\" in 1975. However, the group lasted a long time and were big stars in Japan, as well as having four \"Billboard\" Hot 100 hit singles in the U.S. Their music is also still in print on compact disc, enjoying healthy sales. The sleeve notes to their 1998 Greatest Hits collection, \"The Very Best of Jigsaw\" stated \"A look at Jigsaw’s songs reveals the innovative work of its creators: the advanced song structure, the clever use of classical techniques like counterpoint and a novel approach to using sound effects – leaving the listener with a sadly-overlooked-but-very-impressive catalogue of melodic pop songs\".\n\nFounding member Clive Scott died on 10 May 2009. He had an accident at home two weeks earlier and never recovered, despite having brain surgery. He was 64 years old and is survived by his widow and son.\n\n\n"}

The population was 607 at the 2011 census. The civil parish was abolished in 2016 and merged with Horn to form Exton and Horn.\n\nThe village includes a tree-planted green overlooked by the Fox and Hounds pub. Close to the green is the war memorial to the dead of Exton and Whitwell and to relatives of the Earl of Gainsborough; the names include Tom Cecil Noel MC and Bar and Maurice Dease VC. The memorial was designed by Alfred Young Nutt.\n\nIn the south of the parish towards Rutland Water is Barnsdale Gardens which were created by Geoff Hamilton of the BBC television series \"Gardeners' World\".\n\nFurther south, on the north shore of Rutland Water, stands what was the Barnsdale country house and is now the Barnsdale Hall Hotel and Country Club. Barnsdale was a large country house, built in 1890 as a hunting lodge for Earl Fitzwilliam by architect E. J. May. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nExton Park is a large country estate which has been home to the Noel family (Earls of Gainsborough) for over four centuries. The present Exton Hall was built in the 19th century close to the ruins of the original Tudor mansion which had burnt down in 1810. The romantic Fort Henry, a pleasure-house in the elegant late-eighteenth-century Gothick style, overlooks lakes formed by the North Brook.\n\nThe grand Anglican parish church of St Peter & St Paul lies within the park and contains an impressive collection of monuments including work by Joseph Nollekens. It is a large and impressive medieval parish church, built in the 13th and 14th centuries. The church is a Grade I listed building.\n\nThere is a fine marble monument by Grinling Gibbons, dating from 1685, showing Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden, with his fourth wife, Elizabeth Bertie, and carvings of his 19 children. In 1954, the tomb was the subject of a design by John Piper, later adapted as a textile design by David Whitehead Ltd.\n\nOther monuments in the church include:\n\nThe church spire was struck by lightning in 1843, causing a fire that melted the roof, shattered the windows, and destroyed the west end of the church. It was subsequently rebuilt by J. L. Pearson in 1852/3.\n\n"}

He is best known for his work on \"The Avengers\" and \"Captain America\" for Marvel Comics.\n\nEpting's influences include Alex Raymond, Stan Drake, Jim Holdaway, Joe Kubert, John Buscema, Al Williamson, and José Luis García-López.\n\nEpting received a BFA in graphic design from the University of South Carolina.\n\nIn 1989, Epting read of a contest being conducted by independent comic book publisher First Comics, with the winner's story to be published by the company. Although the contest did not actually exist, First declared Epting one of the \"winners\" and he began drawing for the company. His assignments for First included backup stories for \"Nexus\", guest-artist duties on \"Dreadstar\" and \"Whisper\", and two miniseries starring \"Nexus\" supporting character Judah Maccabee: \"Hammer of God\" and \"Hammer of God: Sword of Justice\".\nBy early 1991, First Comics had gone out of business, and Epting was sending submissions to other comics publishers. He found work at Marvel Comics. Originally assigned to draw half the issues in a six–part biweekly \"The Avengers\" story arc, Epting drew five of the six issues (#335–339). Shortly thereafter, he became the full-time penciler on the series with issue #341 (Nov. 1991). Working closely with writer Bob Harras and inker/colorist Tom Palmer, Epting crafted several \"Avengers\" adventures. The creative team introduced a new version of the Swordsman character in issue #343 and worked on the \"\" crossover storyline. His stint on \"The Avengers\" ended with issue #375 (June 1994).\n\nAfter leaving \"The Avengers\" in 1994, Epting spent the next few years working on Marvel's franchise of X-Men titles including the \"Age of Apocalypse\" crossover and \"Factor-X\", the alternate timeline counterparts of \"X-Factor\". He had a run on the \"X-Factor\" ongoing series, but mostly concentrated on annuals, specials, and mini-series. These included \"X-Men '97\", \"Bishop: X.S.E.\", and the Marvel Comics/Image Comics cross-over \"Team X/Team 7\". In 1998, Epting collaborated with writer Roger Stern on a story starring Marvel's World War II heroes, The Invaders. It was serialized in the first three issues of the \"Marvel Universe\" anthology title and was inked by Al Williamson.\n\nIn 1999, Epting moved to DC Comics. He was the main artist on the \"Superman\" series as well as on Aquaman, where he was teamed up with writer Dan Jurgens. Their work on \"Aquaman\" began with issue #63 and ran until issue #75.\n\nIn 2001, Epting returned to Marvel's \"Avengers\" for two issues (#36 and #37), which had been relaunched three years earlier with writer Kurt Busiek. Most of his work during the early 2000s was for the independent comics publisher, CrossGen. Epting drew issues #1–25 of \"Crux\", a fantasy-adventure book co-created with writer Mark Waid. Epting's next CrossGen project, \"El Cazador\", was an historical adventure centering on a female pirate, it was cancelled after only six issues.\n\nIn 2004, Epting returned to Marvel as one of the artists on the \"Ultimate Nightmare\" limited series. In January 2005, Epting teamed with writer Ed Brubaker to relaunch \"Captain America\". Brubaker and Epting produced the storyline in which Captain America was assassinated and replaced by his former sidekick Bucky Barnes. The creative team later collaborated on \"The Marvels Project\" an eight issue limited series.\n\nIn November 2010, Epting began as the artist on Marvel Comics' flagship title, \"Fantastic Four\". Beginning in issue #583 through #587, Epting illustrated writer Jonathan Hickman's story \"Three\", in which Johnny Storm died. Epting was the artist on the Marvel Comics series, \"FF\".\n\nEpting and Ed Brubaker launched \"Velvet\", an espionage series, for Image Comics in October 2013. Epting collaborated with writer Marguerite Bennett on a new \"Batwoman\" series for DC Comics in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the second martyr in Islam, with the first being his wife, Sumayyah.\n\nYasir was originally from the Malik clan of the Madhhij tribe in Yemen. He and his two brothers, Al-Harith and Malik, travelled northwards to Mecca to search for a fourth brother who was lost. Al-Harith and Malik returned to Yemen, but Yasir decided to settle in Mecca. He entered the protection of Abu Hudhayfa ibn al-Mughira, a member of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\n\nAbu Hudhayfa gave Yasir his slave Sumayyah as a wife, and she bore him a son, Ammar, in c.566. Yasir also had two other sons, Hurth and Abdullah, but there is no indication that Sumayyah was their mother. Hurth, who was the eldest of the three, was killed by the Dil clan before 610.\n\nYasir, Sumayyah, Abdullah and Ammar all became Muslims at an early date \"on the rise of Islam\". From c.614 the Quraysh persecuted Muslims of low social rank. After the death of Abu Hudhayfa left Yasir and his family without a protector in Mecca, the Makhzum clan tortured them to pressure them to abandon their faith.\n\nYasir, Sumayyah and Ammar were forced to stand in the sun in the heat of the day dressed in mail-coats. Muhammad passed while they were standing like that and urged them, \"Patience, O family of Yasir! Your meeting-place will be Paradise.\"\n\nAbu Jahl, a member of the Makhzum clan, killed Sumayyah by stabbing and impaling her with his spear.\n\nIt is generally assumed that Yasir was also killed in the persecution.\n\nHowever, there is no mention of Yasir's death in any of the early sources such as Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa'd, Bukhari, Muslim or Tabari. Since he is not named among those who emigrated to Medina in 622, he probably died before that date; but it is possible that his death was natural.\n\n\n"}

They were private institutions, and combined the functions of a Confucian shrine and a preparatory school. In educational terms, the seowon were primarily occupied with preparing students for the national civil service examinations. In most cases, seowon served only pupils of the aristocratic yangban class. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO recognized a collection of nine seowon as a World Heritage Site.\n\nSeowons first appeared in Korea in the early Joseon Dynasty. They were modeled after early private Chinese academies of classical learning \"shuyuan\". The latter originated in the 8th century under the Tang dynasty and were later dismantled under the Yuan dynasty to become preparatory schools for the imperial examinations under government control. \n\nAlthough the exact year of seowons introduction in Korea is not known for certain, in 1418 King Sejong issued rewards to two scholars for their work in setting up seowon in Gimje and Gwangju. The first seowon to receive a royal charter was the Sosu Seowon in Punggi, presided over by Toegye, which was given a hanging board by King Myeongjong in 1550.\n\nMany seowon were established by leading literati, or by local groups of yangban families. For instance, Ju Se-bong established the Sosu Seowon, which continued in operation long after his death. Some of them were built by Sarim scholars who retired to villages in the wake of literati purges of 16th century and served as their political bases.\n\nMost seowon were closed by an edict of the regent Daewon-gun in the turbulent final years of the 19th century. He banned the unauthorized construction of seowon in 1864, and removed their tax exemption in 1868; finally, in 1871, he ordered all but a handful closed. The provincial yangban were outraged by these measures, and this is among the reasons that Daewon-gun was driven from power in 1873; however, the seowon remained closed.\n\nSeowon, Korean Neo-Confucian Academies is a World Heritage Site consisting of a selection of nine seowan:\n\n\nIn the strategy game Civilization IV, the seowon replaces the University building for Korea.\nIn the strategy game Civilization VI, the seowon replaces the campus district for the Korean Empire.\n\n\n\n"}

The population of the civil parish remained unchanged between the 2001 and the 2011 census'.\n\nGlaston is about south of Rutland Water and is situated on the A47, east of Uppingham. There are approximately 80 houses in total with one public house, The Old Pheasant on Main Road (A47) (previously the Monckton Arms), and a flooring warehouse, Glaston Carpets. There is an active Parish Meeting that is held once a month and villagers are trying to get a bypass for the village. The parish church of St Andrew is a Grade II* listed building and has an unusual central spire.\n\nA rectangular pond is a cartwash of circa 1740, used for soaking cartwheels to prevent the wood shrinking from iron tyres and also for horses' hooves to prevent hardening.\n\nArchaeologists working in the parish in 2000 discovered a late Pleistocene (c. 30,000 b.p.) faunal assemblage in association with an Upper Palaeolithic flint \"leafpoint\".\n\nGlaston has a connection with the Duke of Wellington. Although his family adopted the name Wesley or Wellesley, their original name was Colley, and they were possibly descended from the English-born judge Robert Cowley or Colley who came to Ireland about 1505-06. Robert was almost certainly born in Glaston, where the Colley family were Lords of the Manor from about 1400. Richard Colley ( – 1758), the grandfather of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, changed his surname to Wesley in 1728 when he inherited estates on the death of his cousin, Garret Wesley but was supposed to add the last name of Wellesley not Wesley as Garrets father was Garret Wellesley so Richard could carry on the Wellesley Coat of Arms to get the inheritance, this is why the Duke & his brother corrected the last name from Wesley to Wellesley while in India.\n\nColley Cibber (1671 – 1757), English actor-manager, playwright and Poet Laureate was the eldest child of Jane née Colley, from the Glaston family.\n"}
{"id": "2186657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186657", "title": "Football (word)", "text": "Football (word)\n\nThe English word football may mean any one of several team sports (or the ball used in that respective sport), depending on the national or regional origin and location of the person using the word.\nSo where English is a first language the unqualified use of the word \"football\" is used to refer to the most popular code of football in that region. The sports most frequently referred to as simply \"football\" are Association football, American football, Australian rules football, Canadian football, Gaelic football, rugby league football and rugby union football.\n\nOf the 45 \"national\" FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, 43 use \"football\" in their organisations' official names (Canada and the United States use \"soccer\"). \"Soccer\" is the prevailing term for association football in the United States and Canada, where other codes of \"football\" are dominant. In 2005, Australia's association football governing body changed its name from \"soccer\" to \"football\" to align with the general international usage of the term. In 2006, New Zealand decided to follow suit.\n\nThere are also many other languages where the common term for association football is phonetically similar to the English term \"football\". (See Names for association football.)\nAn early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England: \"Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David\". Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a \"football game\" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: \"during the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself\".\n\nAlthough the accepted etymology of the word football, or \"foot ball\", originated in reference to the action of a foot kicking a ball, this may be a false etymology. An alternative explanation has it that the word originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played \"on foot\". These sports were usually played by peasants, as opposed to the horse-riding sports more often enjoyed by aristocrats. In some cases, the word has been applied to games which involved carrying a ball and specifically banned kicking. For example, the English writer William Hone, writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir Frederick Morton Eden, regarding a game which \"Hone\" refers to as \"Foot-Ball\" played in the parish of Scone, Perthshire:\nThe game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party, \"but no person was allowed to kick it.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\nConversely, in 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning \"...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\", suggesting that \"football\" was in fact being differentiated from games that involved other parts of the body.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) traces the written use of the word \"football\" (as \"foteballe\"), referring to the game, to 1409. The first recorded use of the word to refer to the ball was in 1486, and the first use as a verb in 1599. \n\nThe word \"soccer\" originated as an Oxford \"-er\" slang abbreviation of \"association\", and is credited to late nineteenth century English footballer, Charles Wreford-Brown. However, like the William Webb Ellis rugby story, it is believed to be most likely apocryphal. There is also the sometimes-heard variation, \"soccer football\".\n\nWithin Australia the term \"football\" is ambiguous and can mean up to four different codes of football in Australian English, depending on the context, geographical location and cultural factors; this includes soccer, Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union. In the states of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania the slang term \"footy\" is also used in an unofficial context, while in these states the two rugby football codes are called \"rugby\". There is a different situation in New South Wales, Queensland and ACT, where rugby union or rugby league are most popular, and \"football\" can refer to those codes. Australia-wide, \"soccer\" is commonly used to describe association football, with this usage going back more than a century, with \"football\" gaining traction since Soccer Australia was renamed Football Federation Australia in 2005.\n\nIn Canada, \"football\" refers to Canadian football or American football, often differentiated as either \"CFL\" (from the governing Canadian Football League) or \"NFL\" (from the US National Football League). Because of the similarity between the games, many people in both countries do not consider the two styles of gridiron football separate sports \"per se\", but rather different codes of the same sport which has a shared origin in the Harvard vs McGill game played in 1874 credited with the creation of this sport. If a Canadian were to say, \"My brother plays football in the States\", it would be clear from context that American football is meant. Canadian French usage parallels English usage, with \"le football\" usually referring to Canadian or American football, and \"le soccer\" referring to association football. When there is ambiguity, \"le football canadien\" or \"le football américain\" is used. \n\nRugby union football in Canada is almost always referred to simply as \"rugby\".\n\nIn most of the English-speaking Caribbean, \"football\" and \"soccer\" are both used to refer to association football, but use of the word \"football\" is far more common. The exception is the Bahamas, where the term \"football\" is used exclusively (while not actually in the Caribbean, usage in Bermuda follows that of the Bahamas). The nickname of the Trinidad and Tobago team, \"The Soca Warriors\", refers to a style of music, not the word soccer.\n\nIn Ireland, \"football\" can mean Association football, Gaelic football, or Rugby union.\n\nNew Zealand Football is the governing body for Association football in the country. The term can also be used to refer to rugby league or union, better-known as simply \"rugby\". The slang term \"footy\" generally only means either of the two codes of rugby football, while rugby league is traditionally known as \"rugby league\" or just \"league\". Usage of the term \"soccer\" has gone through a period of transition in recent times as the federation changed its name to New Zealand Football from New Zealand Soccer and the nickname of its women's team to \"Football Ferns\" from \"SWANZ\".\n\nIn South Africa, the word \"football\" generally refers to Association football. However, Association football is commonly known as \"soccer\" despite this. The domestic first division is the Premier Soccer League and both in conversation and the media (see e.g. \"The Sowetan\" or \"Independent Online\"), the term \"soccer\" is used. The stadium used for the final of the 2010 FIFA World Cup was known as Soccer City. Despite this, the country's national association is called the South African Football Association and \"football\" is mostly used in official contexts.\n\nRugby union is another popular football code in South Africa, but it is commonly known as just \"rugby\" as rugby league has a smaller presence in the country.\n\nThe unqualified use of \"football\" in the United Kingdom tends to refer to the most popular code of football in the country, which in the cases of England and Scotland is Association football. However the term \"soccer\" is understood by most as a name for association football. The word \"soccer\" was in fact the most common way of referring to Association football in the UK until around the 1970s, when it began to be perceived incorrectly as an Americanism.\n\nFor fans who are more interested in other codes of football, within their sporting community, the use of the word 'football' may refer to their own code. However even within such sporting communities an unqualified mention of 'football' would usually be a reference to association football. In its heartlands, rugby league is referred to as either \"football\" or just \"league\".\n\nFans of Gaelic football in Northern Ireland rarely use \"football\" for the sport (see above). Outside the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, Gaelic football is usually known by its full name.\n\nAmerican football is usually known by that name or \"gridiron\", a name made familiar to a wider British audience by Channel 4, when it showed American football on Sunday evenings in the period 1982–1992.\n\nIn the United States, the word \"football\" only refers to the sport of American football. As in Canada, \"football\" is used inclusively of Canadian football with American and Canadian football generally seen as two variants of the same sport. The term \"North American football\" is sometimes used to refer to both games together.\n\nThe sport of association football is commonly called \"soccer\" in the United States. The word derives from \"association\" – as in the Football Association – in contrast to \"rugger\", or rugby football. It is English in origin, and caught on in the United States to distinguish the game from the locally better known American football; it also became predominant in other countries where another sport is known as football, such as Australia with Australian rules football. The term was in use in Britain throughout the early 20th century and became especially prominent in the decades after World War II, but by the 1980s British fans had begun avoiding the term, largely because it was seen as an Americanism.\n\nBoth rugby union and rugby league are generally known as rugby. Union is the more commonly played variant in the United States. Rugby league and Gaelic football have very small, albeit growing, numbers of adherents.\n\nMany languages use phonetic approximations of the English word \"football\" for association football. Examples include:\n\nThis commonality is reflected in the auxiliary languages Esperanto and Interlingua, which utilize \"futbalo\" and \"football\", respectively.\n\nThese loanwords bear little or no resemblance to the native words for \"foot\" and \"ball\". By contrast, some languages have calques of \"football\": their speakers use equivalent terms that combine their words for \"foot\" and \"ball\". An example is the Greek ποδόσφαιρο (podósfero) and the Chinese 足球 (zú qíu).\n\nIn German, \"\"Football\"\" is a loanword for American football, while the German word \"Fußball\", a calque of \"football\" (\"Fuß\" = \"foot\", \"Ball\" = \"ball\"), means association football. The same goes for Dutch \"voetbal\" (\"voet\" = \"foot\", \"bal\" = \"ball\"), Swedish \"fotboll\" (\"fot\" = \"foot\", \"boll\" = \"ball\"), and so on — the words for \"foot\" and \"ball\" are very similar in all the Germanic languages. Only two Germanic languages do not use \"football\" or a calque thereof as their primary word for association football:\nThe Celtic languages also generally refer to association football with calques of \"football\" — an example is the Welsh \"pêl-droed\". However, Irish, which like Afrikaans is native to a country where \"soccer\" is the most common English term for the sport, uses \"sacar\".\n\n\n"}

It is the largest city and the headquarters of the Jalpaiguri district as well as of the Jalpaiguri division of West Bengal, covering the jurisdiction of the five districts of North Bengal. The city is located on the banks of the Teesta River which is the second largest river in West Bengal after the Ganges, on the foothills of the Himalayas. The city is the home to the circuit bench of the Kolkata High Court, the other seat being at Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Jalpaiguri features the JGEC deemed University, the second campus of the University of North Bengal, the newly built Jalpaiguri Medical College (Where? Bad Link) and the Biswa Bangla Krirangan/ Jalpaiguri Sports Village. It lies 35 km away from its twin city, Siliguri which is the largest metropolis of the region.\n\nThe name \"Jalpaiguri\" most probably comes from the Bhutanese term \"je-le-pe-go-ri\", meaning a place where warm clothes are traded, suggesting a trading centre. Another suggestion is that it is from the word \"Jalpai\" meaning olive, and \"Guri\" meaning a place. The city once had many olive trees.\n\nThe Raikat family controlled large estates in Baikunthapur, now a part of West Bengal, first as subjects to the state of Koch Bihar, later as Zamindars to the Mughal rulers of Bengal, and then to the British. The Raikat family is descended from the Koch dynasty, who took control of the Kamata Kingdom in 1515. The family founder was Sisya Singha, elder brother of Viswa Singha, the second Koch Maharajah. At Viswa Singha's coronation in 1523, Sisya Singha held the royal umbrella atop the crown, a sign of vassalage. Sisya Singha was given the title \"Raikat\" or \"family guardian\", and his descendants were hereditary prime ministers of the Koch Bihar successor state to the Kamata kingdom. They were given the land of Baikunthapur in the present Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal.\n\nJalpaiguri is located at . It has an average elevation of 75 metres (246 feet).Jalpaiguri lies in the middle of the vast fertile plains (Terai) south of the Himalayas, watered by innumerable rivers and rivulets rising from and flowing down the Himalayas.

Winters are again quite severe and chilly, with the cold Himalayan winds blowing straight into the city. Temperatures are around 8 to 14 degrees Celsius during this period. The lowest recorded temperature in Jalpaiguri City was 2.1 degree Celsius.\n\nIn the 2011 census, Jalpaiguri had a population of 107,341 (53,708 male and 53,633 female) while the Metropolitan region had a population of 169,002; 85,226 males and 83,787 females.

The All India Trinamool Congress is in power of this municipal body. The chairman of the municipality is Mohan Bose.\n\nJalpaiguri has been witnessing radical changes, along with rapid development in segments like industry, real estate, and information technology firms, and education, since the advent of the twenty-first century. The changes are with respect to infrastructure and industrial growth for steel (direct reduced iron), metal, cement and knowledge-based industries.

Housing co-operatives and flats, shopping malls, multiplexes, cineplexes a science and energy park, a software technology park (STPI), hotels and stadiums have also come up.\n\nJalpaiguri has its own bank, the Jalpaiguri Central Co-operative Bank, whose head office is located at Temple Street of the city. Founded in 1919, it has more than 20 branches with ATMs spread across North Bengal.\nThe municipality is responsible for providing basic services, such as potable water and sanitation. The water is supplied by the municipal authorities using its groundwater resources, and almost all the houses in the municipal area are connected through the system. Solid waste is collected every day by the city van from individual houses. The surface drains, mostly uncemented, drain into the Teesta River. Electricity is supplied by the West Bengal State Electricity Board, and the West Bengal Fire Service provides emergency services like fire tenders.

Since the construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, the village has been closed off on three sides by water and the area is known as the Hambleton Peninsula.\n\nThe parish originally included the settlements of Upper Hambleton, Middle Hambleton and Nether Hambleton. The latter two have now been almost completely submerged by the construction of Rutland Water (originally known as Empingham Reservoir). The Jacobean Old Hall in Middle Hambleton (built in 1611) is now situated on the water's edge.\n\nThe village contains the 12th century Church of England church of St Andrew, a pub called The Finch's Arms and a hotel and restaurant, Hambleton Hall. The church, much enlarged over its history still has an original Norman south doorway and was extensively restored and fitted out during the 19th century. This included excellent stained glass windows created mainly by J Egan during the last decade of the 19th century. Two of these were dedicated by the Reverend David Elliot Young to his mother and infant child who are buried in the attached graveyard.

It was lock free and throughout its working life it was extensively used. It had coal, sand and salt wharfs, a scrap iron wharf and various works along its banks. An interesting works was Molineux, Webb, & Company’s Glass Works situated at the head of the branch where flint glass products were made.\n\nIn 1801, Samuel Oldknow, then the Chairman of the Peak Forest Canal Company, offered an Edward Stelfox £50 towards the cost of building two lime kilns on the banks of the Ashton Canal on the condition that he burned limestone brought along the Peak Forest Canal. The site of these kilns is unknown but it is suspected that they were somewhere on this branch near Limekiln Lane.\n\nFrom the junction with the Ashton Canal, the branch ran to the north-west, until it passed under Mill Street. There was a sharp turn immediately beyond the bridge, and it continued in a north-easterly direction. It remained in use until the 1950s but by this time it was slowly becoming derelict. However, part of it remained open and British Waterways now has a yard there.\n\nIn 1851, there were coal wharves equipped with weighing machines on both sides of the section from the Ashton Canal to Mill Street bridge, with an undeveloped area on the east bank nearest to the junction. This clear area had become the Albion Spindle Works by 1891, but had been subdivided and was occupied by a toy balloon works and a chain works in 1922. The chain works had gone by 1950, and the wharf to the east of the section had become an engineering works. A paint works occupied most of the west side wharves. The engineering works had expanded to include the site of the chain works by the 1960s, when its chief activity was metal stamping, and it remained so in 1969.\n\nTo the north of the bridge, the 1851 map shows that the west bank contained Wharf Street Cotton Mill and four coal wharves, each with a weighing machine. On the east bank, there was a coal wharf with weighing machine, a fire brick yard, another coal wharf, most of which bordered onto another arm which turned back and ended close to Mill Street, and a third coal wharf on the side arm. By 1891, the area between Mill Street bridge and the side arm had been redeveloped and was occupied by a wire works, which included a small tramway, and the arm had been filled in. Between then and 1951, the maps do not indicate what was located there, but by 1951 there was an engineering works and a clothing factory. The engineering works was making lift equipment in 1953.\n\nBeyond the arm, the west bank contained Canal Street Dye Works and a dockyard with a dry dock in 1851. The end of the basin was quite large, and the Manchester Flint Glass Works was located beyond it. The eastern side of the basin is marked as a brick field, where clay would have been extracted. By 1891, the brick field had become a Bedstead and Safe Works, with an electric engineering works and St Jude's Church occupying the east side of the plot. The glass works had expanded to cover the former docks, and the basin had been reduced to a narrow finger. By 1951, the site to the north of the side arm was occupied by a shirt factory, the Corporation Cleansing Department's garage and an engineering works, where cylinder grinding and welding were carried out by 1953. The whole area north of Mill Street bridge had been redeveloped by the time the 1972/1981 map was published.\n\n\n"}

Ketton ward, which also includes the parishes of Barrowden, Tinwell and Tixover has two councillors on Rutland County Council.\n\nKetton was originally \"Chetene\" meaning \"on the banks of the River Chater\". It was originally three separate settlements: Ketton, Aldgate and Geeston; but as they grew they merged to form the village that Ketton is today.\n\nThe village has a post office and general store, a library, two pubs (the Railway Inn and the Northwick Arms), a sports centre, a playschool and a Church of England primary school. The village has two churches (Church of England and Methodist).\n\nThe earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin are 12th century. The church has a central tower and spire. The west front is an example of late 12th century transitional architecture and the remainder of the church is mainly 13th century. The nave was restored under the direction of George Gilbert Scott in 1861–62 and the chancel under the direction of his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in 1863–66. Jackson's chancel roof was painted by Ninian Comper in 1950. The stone is from Barnack. There are Ketton headstones in the churchyard; one by the lychgate depicts mason's tools and is by stonemason William Hibbins of Ketton. William Hibbins built Hibbins House, which is still standing today.\n\nRobert of Ketton was the first person to translate the Qur'an into Latin. The translation was complete by 1143.\n\nThe village gives its name to Ketton stone, a limestone which is quarried locally and is used in many buildings in the village and elsewhere. Some areas of former quarrying are now a Site of Special Scientific Interest, maintained by Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust.\n\nThe limestone is used to make cement. Ketton Cement Works opened in 1928 and by November that year the number of staff had risen to 250. The plant, owned by Hanson Cement (now part of HeidelbergCement), meets more than 10% of the UK demand for cement.\n\nIn 2013 Rutland County Council approved plans for Lark Energy to build a solar farm on land reclaimed from a 1940s quarry. The solar farm provides 13% of the cement work's annual energy consumption. The second phase was opened by Secretary of State for Energy Amber Rudd.\n\nIn 2004 Rutland County Council planning committee resolved to approve a planning application for one wind turbine on land adjacent to the cement works off Steadfold Lane in Ketton. However, issues surrounding fast jets flying from RAF Cottesmore meant that a planning permission was never granted.\n\nIn 2011 REG Windpower announced plans to install two wind turbines near Steadfold Lane. The proposal was withdrawn in August 2012.\n\nKetton is served by buses on the service between Stamford and Uppingham. Ketton and Collyweston railway station closed in 1966.\n"}

In the movie, Louis de Funès plays an industrialist named Bertrand Barnier who discovers over the course of a single day that his daughter is pregnant, he has been robbed by an employee, and various other calamities have befallen his household and his business.\n\nAn English-language version of the movie was made in 1991, by John Landis, under the same name and starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nChristian Martin, a modest accountant in a large firm owned by Bertrand Barnier, surprises his boss by asking him for a 100% increase in his wages. Martin is on the point of proposing to a girl and doesn't want to ask for her hand in marriage while making a lowly accountant's salary.\n\nAfter Barnier refuses to give him the raise, Martin tells him that he's stolen more than sixty million francs from him by falsifying the firm's accounting records. When Barnier threatens to report this to the police, Martin points out that as a consequence of the fraud Barnier has now submitted false income statements to the tax office, a serious crime. Barnier has no choice but to give in to blackmail and he agrees to give Martin the raise and name him vice-president of the firm.\n\nMartin then reveals that the young woman whom he intends to marry is Barnier's daughter. In order to recover his sixty million francs, Barnier asks Martin to give back the stolen monies so that he can give them to his daughter as a wedding present.\n\nBarnier learns that Martin converted the sum into jewelry and the jewels are in a bank. He tells Martin to get the jewelry, but Martin refuses without a signed document from Barnier stating that he will give the jewelry to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier agrees and Martin leaves for the bank.\n\nWhile Martin is gone, Barnier talks to his daughter Colette. Without mentioning Martin, he tells her that he's opposed to her marriage which causes her to break down and cry. On the advice of her maid Bernadette, Colette lies to her father and tells him that she's pregnant by her lover. Hearing this, Barnier decides to approve the marriage and give the sixty million francs/jewelry to Colette as a wedding present.\n\nAfter Barnier's talk with Colette a young woman named Jacqueline Bouillotte comes to see him. She tells Barnier that she's in love with Christian Martin and that she lied to him and told him that she was Barnier's daughter. Barnier realizes that this means that Martin is not in love with his daughter Colette. It also dawns on him that he won’t be able to get his sixty million francs back from Martin or his daughter since they won’t be getting married.\n\nUpon confronting Colette, Barnier learns that she's in love with Oscar the chauffeur. At that moment Martin comes back from the bank and Barnier gets the jewelry, now in a black suitcase, from him. Martin then learns that Jacqueline has lied to him about being Barnier's daughter, which causes them to argue and break up.\n\nIn the meantime Barnier has discovered that Oscar had joined a six-year polar expedition due to a \"disappointment of love\" (not being able to marry Colette.) Barnier tells Martin that he'll give him back the suitcase with the jewelry if he'll marry Colette. Martin hesitates and tries to put Barnier on to a new \"pigeon\": Philippe Dubois, Barnier's masseur.\n\nDuring this time, Colette's maid Bernadette announces her resignation and packs her suitcase; she is going to marry Colette's former fiancé the Baron Honoré de la Butinière. Before she leaves the house Bernadette puts down her suitcase filled with clothes and accidentally picks up the suitcase containing the sixty million francs worth of jewelry.\n\nBarnier tries to persuade his masseur to marry his daughter Colette, promising to give him the suitcase full of jewelry as a wedding present. Barnier almost has a heart attack when he opens the suitcase and finds clothes inside instead of jewels.\n\nAt this point, Martin comes back and tells Barnier that before he had gone to the bank, while they were discussing giving the jewelry to Colette as a wedding present, he had hidden a piece of paper among the documents. When Barnier had signed an agreement to give Colette the jewelry, he had also signed a document giving Martin banking power of attorney. This allowed Martin to divert sixty million more francs from Barnier's accounts. Martin offers to exchange this second stolen sum for the jewelry representing the first stolen sum.\n\nBarnier gives Martin the suitcase with the jewelry thinking it's the suitcase full of clothes. However, unbeknownst to him Bernadette's driver had come back with the suitcase of jewelry and exchanged it for the suitcase of clothes. Barnier, thinking he's given Martin the clothes, invents an address for Jacqueline, Martin's true love, and sends him on his way.\n\nAfter a series of comic errors, Barnier again finds himself with Bernadette's suitcase full of clothes. After a funny telephone conversation with the Baron, Bernadette's new husband, Barnier recovers the suitcase filled with jewelry from Martin who has discovered that the address Barnier had given him for Jacqueline is wrong. Barnier, pleased to have finally recovered the suitcase filled with jewelry confesses to inventing the address to get rid of Martin and tells him that Jacqueline (who had come back earlier) is in fact in Barnier's office.\n\nWhile all of this is going on a lady named Charlotte enters the house. She's been sent by the employment agency to replace Bernadette as Colette's maid. She tells Barnier that when she was younger she worked for the Barnier family and that she had a daughter who is now engaged to a man named Christian Martin. Barnier realizes that the young woman being discussed is Jacqueline and Charlotte reveals that Jacqueline is in fact Charlotte and Barnier's daughter. Barnier needs several minutes to recover from the shock during which time Oscar returns home to Colette and all seems to end well.\n\nHowever...while everybody is congratulating each other, Bernadette arrives thinking that there has been a mistake with the suitcases. Not wanting to disturb anyone she inconspicuously exchanges the suitcases. Barnier asks Martin to open the now famous suitcase, thinking that he is going to take the jewelry out of it and give it to his daughters as a wedding present. He has an apoplectic fit on seeing that it's full of clothes. Everybody jumps in cars, on motorbikes, and on bicycles to go to Bernadette's and recover the suitcase of jewelry once and for all.\n\n\n\n"}

A Grade I listed building, it contains a Saxon arch and some carved stone from the Anglo-Saxon era, but most of the existing fabric is in the Perpendicular style, dating from the late 13th and early 14th century. The church, in the Diocese of Peterborough, is part of the Oakham team ministry.\n\nHannah Ayscough, mother of Isaac Newton, was born in the village in 1623. The regicide Thomas Waite has been claimed to be a son of a village pub landlord. William Kitchen Parker, the zoologist, worked as a druggist's assistant to the village's doctor.\n\nThe Market Store is a community shop, opened in May 2010.\n\nThe village pub is the Black Bull Inn.\n\nThere is a stocks with whipping post on the village green which was probably the location of the medieval market place.\n\nThere is a small industrial estate to the north of the village, where ironstone was mined from 1906-72 by James Pain Ltd, later becoming Stewarts & Lloyds then BSC Tubes Division. The brick terraced houses on the road to Thistleton were built for the workers. Access to the mine was by railway, which joined the Melton-Bourne railway at Pain's Sidings. More information is found at the Rutland Railway Museum.\n\nThe Markon Engineering company (derived from Stamford Engineering), was started in the village in 1959 by Messrs Fawkes and Knight, and moved to Oakham in 1960 then Dalcross near Inverness in 1969. They made electrical generators and were taken over by Newage Ltd in 1987. Generators of the Markon name are now made by Cummins Generator Technologies, based in Stamford. They now make two-pole single-phase capacitor-type alternators under the Markon name.\n\nThe village is on the eastern side of an escarpment overlooking the Vale of Catmose. The area's subsoil is Upper Lias and Inferior Oolite.\n\nMost of the civil parish lies to the north and the east, including part of RAF Cottesmore (now Kendrew Barracks), but not the main runway. The boundary crosses \"Teigh Road\" at Netherfields where it borders Teigh. South of Hall Farm, it borders Wymondham and Leicestershire. The Oakham Canal passes through the west of the parish.

There he studied piano, and later cello and organ. The years of World War II were especially difficult for the young man. Although Eben was raised as a Catholic, his father was a Jew and thus fell foul of the National Socialist occupiers of his homeland. In 1943, aged 14, Eben was captured and imprisoned by the Nazis in Buchenwald, remaining there for the duration of the war.\n\nAfter being released, he was admitted to the Prague Academy for Music, and there he studied piano with František Rauch and composition with Pavel Bořkovec. He graduated in 1954. Beginning in 1955 Eben taught for many years in the music history department at Charles University in Prague. Between 1977 and 1978 he was professor of composition at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester. In 1990 he became professor of composition at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague and President of the Prague Spring Festival.\n\nEben refused to join the Czech Communist Party and continued openly attending church, thus forfeiting many career advancements before 1989. After the Communist government crumbled, however, he was given several important appointments and awards, among them presidency of the Prague Spring Festival (1989) and the Medal of Merit (2002). Among Eben's most important late works is his 1992-1993 oratorio \"Posvátná znamení\" (Sacred Symbols). Despite declining health from a stroke in his final years, Eben remained busy, composing mostly organ and choral works. He died in Prague on 24 October 2007.\n\nEben's compositions are often performed in both Europe and overseas, especially in the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia. In 1991, Eben was awarded the title of Knight of the French Ministry of Culture, Arts and Letters. Two years earlier he became honorary president of the Society for Sacred Music. An international organ competition bearing his name has been organized since 2004 in Opava.\n\nThe Petr Eben International Organ Competition, held in Opava, Czech Republic, is named in his honour.\n\nHis son David Eben is the founder and director of Schola Gregoriana Pragensis, an \"a cappella\" male voice choir.\n\nOver more than half a century Eben produced a good deal of music in diverse genres. His earliest large works included his 1954 First Organ Concerto (the Second came in 1984) and Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1960–1961). He wrote numerous vocal, choral, symphonic, piano, and chamber works, but it was organ music which remained his greatest love and in which he was most prolific.\n\nAmong Eben's biggest projects were the oratorio \"Apologia Socratus\", the ballet \"Curse and Benediction\" (Kletby a dobrořečení), written for the Holland Festival 1983, the orchestral works \"Hours of the Night\" (Noční hodiny) and Prague Nocturne (Pražské nokturno), for the Vienna Philharmonic, the Organ Concerto No. 2 for the dedication of the new organ for Radio Vienna, the mass \"Missa cum populo\" for the Avignon Festival, the oratorio \"Holy Symbols\" (Posvátná znamení) for Salzburg Cathedral, and the opera \"Jeremiah\" (intended for church, not theatrical, performance). He also wrote children's songs such as \"Sníh\", a song about snow which won an award for Best Children's Choir Song in Illinois.\n\nEben was considered a master at improvisation on the organ and piano, but composition remained his main area of interest. However, many of his organ compositions in particular were based on his public improvisations. These improvisations were the origin for the Two Choral Fantasies, Landscapes of Patmos, and Job. Eben improvised and developed a cycle of organ movements in the years from 1991 to 2003 based on excerpts from John Comenius' famous book, \"Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart\" that became a published work in response to positive reception.\n\nHis music has been widely performed and recorded since about 1980, with his popularity still apparently on the rise. Stylistically, his musical language can be considered as \"neoexpressionistic\" in many ways, however in some works we can hear some kind of new forms of impressionistic tendencies. He is often compared with Olivier Messiaen (the comparison is valid to some extent, in that both men wrote a great deal of organ music, and quite often have examples of their organ output included in the same recitals), but overall his style is less consistently experimental and voluptuous than Messiaen's.\n\nThe majority of Eben's works has been published by Czech label Supraphon. Some recordings of his organ pieces were performed by himself. The Norwegian organist Halgeir Schiager has recorded five CDs of Petr Eben's organ music on Hyperion Records. The German organist Gunther Rost has recorded 6 discs of Petr Eben's organ music on label Motette. The interpretation recorded on this CD-SACD series was largely influenced by the composer's personal suggestions and comments. The series compiles all of Eben's works for solo organ which have been published to this date, played by Gunther Rost on various contemporary instruments. The speaker in both cycles, Job (vol. I) and The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart (vol. V, published in 2008), is Gert Westphal, one of Germany's most important contemporary reciters. Some of his CDs feature works by Sieglinde Ahrens. Petr Eben's Moto Ostinato from \"Sunday Music\" is played by English organist Gillian Weir in her \"The King of Instruments\" series (Priory Records' PRDVD 7001). The Canadian organist Philip Crozier, playing the Fulda Cathedral organ, has also recorded a number of Eben's works on the Azimuth label.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2186708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186708", "title": "Morcott", "text": "Morcott\n\nRutland County Council designated Morcott a Conservation Area in 1981, one of 34 conservation areas in Rutland which are \"of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\".\n\nRutland County Council documents describe Morcott as a moderately sized, compact and attractive Rutland village four miles to the east of the nearest town, Uppingham located in undulating, open countryside, approximately 75 metres above sea level on the north facing slope of a tributary of the River Chater.\n\nThe village name is an Old English derivation of \"a cottage on the moor\". The village is recorded as Morcote in the Domesday survey of 1086 and formed part of the king's manor of Barrowden. The village served the manorial interests of several different ownerships but passed to the Fydell Rowley family in the early 19th century. The Church of St Mary is the defining landmark in the village and is regarded as the most complete Norman church in Rutland.\n\nThe historic origins of the village is associated with agriculture and has resulted in a legacy of good, stone built farmhouses, cottages and outbuildings. Although none of the surviving houses are believed to date from earlier than the 17th century, the style of many of the buildings and the dated examples indicate that Morcott shared in a period of transformation in the 17th and 18th centuries that reflected wider economic prosperity, based on growing demand and improvements in agriculture, notably in crop rotation and the wealth generated by sheep farming, that occurred in large parts of rural middle England at that time.\n\nThe historic importance of a number of the buildings within the village is reflected in there being 30 entries on the National Heritage List for England. Outside of the village, but within the parish, the windmill on Barrowden Road is a prominent landmark in views from the conservation area and surrounding countryside.\n\nThe defunct Morcott railway station on the branch line between Seaton and Luffenham closed in 1966. The road bridge which carries the High Street over the old railway cutting is a skew arch containing construction features rarely seen.\n\nSt Mary the Virgin, the parish church, is a Grade I listed building. The Norman church features a 'pancake' window on the west side, and a north arcade considered to be 'the best example of Norman work in the area'.\n\nIn 2014 Rutland County Council cited additional buildings to those statutorily listed, 'as contributing to the character of the village' in the Morcott Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Proposal. These additions included a row of estate workers' houses on Fydell Row, a prominent pair of 19th-century farmhouses on the High Street, and the Village Hall - formerly a Baptist chapel rebuilt in 1903 in the Arts and Crafts style.\n\nMorcott Hall was an independent girls' school for 25 years but is now again a private house.\n\nUntil the early 2000s a Post Office and small shop was open in the village. Once this closed the village was mainly served by the two petrol stations locally, the social enterprise the Barrowden & Wakerley Community Shop, and local towns Uppingham, Oakham, and Stamford. The nearest cities are Peterborough to the east, and Leicester to the west, both accessible by train from Oakham.\n\nThe White Horse Inn (currently (2019) closed) on Stamford Road is an historic coaching inn at the junction of Stamford Road and High Street and forms an attractive entrance to the east end of the village. It houses a plaque to 1982 Grand National winner Grittar, whose owner Frank Gilman lived in the parish. In the 21st century, changes in licence owners has seen it closed by Punch Taverns for long periods.\n\nA long-term closure in the mid 2010s paved the way for redevelopment of the village's Little Chef, which was also closed even though it supported passing trade from the busy A47, two petrol stations, two garages, and a Travelodge hotel; giving the village a new cafe restaurant, the Country Lounge. The former Travelodge now operates as a Redwings Lodge.\n\n"}
{"id": "2186710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186710", "title": "Stockport Branch Canal", "text": "Stockport Branch Canal\n\nThe Stockport Branch Canal was a 5-mile (8 km) branch of the Ashton Canal from Clayton to Stockport.\n\nThe canal left the main line of the Ashton Canal at Stockport Junction (otherwise Clayton Junction), between locks 10 and 11 at Clayton, and it terminated at Stockport Basin just beyond the top of Lancashire Hill. It was just less than five miles long (7.87 km) and it was lock free.\n\nIt went through Gorton, Abbey Hey and Reddish and it opened for trade in 1797.\n\nAt Reddish, it was intended that a further branch (the Beat Bank Branch Canal) would be built, and work actually began on construction of this branch. Only an isolated section of that branch was ever built, and it never connected with the Stockport Branch.\n\nThe canal was for the most part urban, being heavily industrialised along most of its length. Between Clayton and Gorton there was a heavy concentration of engineering factories and ironworks as well as the Canal Company’s Depot at Gorton. Beyond Gorton, all the way through Reddish, cotton mills predominated.\n\nThe main line of the Ashton Canal had been authorised by Act of Parliament in June 1792, and in March 1793 the Proprietors obtained a second Act, which authorised a branch to Stockport, a branch which would leave the Stockport branch at Reddish and run along the Tame Valley to Beat Bank to serve some coal mines at Haughton Green, and a separate branch to Hollinwood. The Act authorised the Proprietors to raise an additional £30,000, with which to fund all three branches. Although the Company advertised for an engineer, they did not find one, and their agent James Meadows probably oversaw the construction. The Hollinwood branch was finished first, in late 1796, but the Stockport branch opened soon afterwards, in January 1797.\n\nWith good supplies of coal from the mines at Werneth which the Hollinwood branch served, and difficulties in building the Beat Bank branch due to it being on a clay slope, the Company decided to abandon further work on the Beat Bank branch, and notified William Hulton, the owner of the collieries at Denton, that they could not afford to continue. An Act to formally abandon it was sought in 1798, and although opposed by Hulton, it was obtained. In the same year, the Canal Company built warehouses at Stockport, and wharves were allocated there to assist the Werneth Colliery to sell its coal, and thus generate more traffic on the canal.\n\nWith the coming of the railways, traffic fell, and dividends had dropped to 6 per cent by 1842. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway offered to buy the canal for an annual payment of £12,364, which would give the shareholders a 7 per cent return, and with a further payment of £540 per year to fund interest payments on debts, the Canal Company accepted gratefully in 1846. The takeover was formalised by an Act of Parliament in 1848, which required the Railway Company to maintain the canal in good order. This they did for many years, running their own boats for the carriage of goods until 1892. The Canal Company was wound up in 1883, and the shareholders were given shares in the Railway Company.\n\nThe canal was principally used to carry general cargo, such as supplying raw cotton to the mills and returning with manufactured goods. It also carried coal for the mills and the townsfolk who lived in the neighbourhood. Another important cargo was the supply of grain to William Nelstrop & Company’s Albion Corn Mill at Stockport Basin.\n\nIn its early days there was passenger carrying on the Ashton Canal and one of the routes was between Manchester and Stockport.\n\nThe canal began to decline as a result of competition from railways and roads, and was described as derelict as early as 1922.\n\nCommercial carrying ceased in the 1930s but it lingered on into the 1950s as a barely navigable waterway. At one stage in the 1950s it was dredged but this improvement did not attract any traffic. Stockport Basin was the first section to be filled in but it was not until 1962 that the canal was officially abandoned by the British Transport Commission, who had been responsible for it since 1948. It took many years to fill in and this was a disagreeable procedure for people living along its length.\n\nMuch of the line of the former canal remains intact and there are now plans to re-open it as an amenity canal; these plans have the support of local authorities. Scott states that a British Waterways report indicates that reopening the canal is technically feasible.\n\n\n"}

Several scholars date its construction to the turn of the 18th century, when tiered towers were exceedingly popular in Russia.\nA legend postulates that the tower was built more than a century earlier by Ivan the Terrible's artisans in just a week's time. As the legend goes, the Kazan queen Söyembikä threw herself down from the highest tier, hence the name. This legend has nothing to do with the real history of the tower because Söyembikä was forcibly detained by Muscovite forces in 1551 and moved to the city of Kasimov and died years later (and suicide is an unpardonable sin in the queen's Muslim faith). The legend was popular since the early 18th century.\n\nSome even go as far as stating that the tower is the only extant structure from the pre-Russian Tatar citadel. If the tower really reflects some original features of Tatar architecture, then its design should have certainly influenced that of the Kremlin towers in Moscow. Supporters of the theory point out that the only similar structures were built in Central Asia, which was politically and culturally connected with the derelict Khanate of Kazan. Several facts point to the validity of this theory: the size of the masonry, the absence of documentary evidence supporting Russian building, the respect paid to the tower by the local Tatar population, and so forth.\n\nIn the Imperial period, the tower used to be topped with a double-headed eagle, which the Bolsheviks replaced with a red star. It is currently crowned with a Muslim crescent.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the architect Alexey Shchusev reproduced the structure's outline in the Kazan Rail Station of Moscow.\n"}

The population remained less than 100 at the 2011 census and was included in the civil parish of Edith Weston.\nNormanton Hall was a seat of the Earls of Ancaster and an important centre of their estates. The stable block of their hall is now Normanton Park hotel. In the 18th century the village was cleared to make a park for the estate of the Heathcote family with the population mainly re-housed in Empingham.\n\nIn the 1970s much of the parish was flooded by the construction of the Rutland Water reservoir.\n\nSt Matthew's Church is a Grade II listed building, built in classical style. The tower and the western portico were built by Thomas Cundy Jr between 1826 and 1829, based on the design of St John's, Smith Square in Westminster, while the nave and apse were constructed in 1911, by J. B. Gridley of London. The building was once the private chapel for the Normanton Estate, but it was de-consecrated in 1970, and was to have been demolished as part of the reservoir construction, as its floor was below the proposed water level. Following a public outcry, the lower half was filled with stone and rubble, and a concrete cap constructed just below the level of the windows. An embankment was built around the church leaving it a prominent feature on the water's edge. The structure formerly housed a museum recording the history of Rutland Water, which is now located in the visitor centre. The structure is now used as a venue for civil weddings and concerts.\n\nNormanton is the name of a ward of Rutland County Council, returning two councillors.

{"id": "2186718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186718", "title": "Silk Cut", "text": "Silk Cut\n\nSilk Cut is a British brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Gallaher Group, a division of Japan Tobacco. The packaging is characterised by a distinctive stark white packet with the brand name in a purple, blue, red, silver, white or green square.\n\nSilk Cut was launched in 1964. In the past, Silk Cut cigarettes contained approximately 75% tobacco, the rest of the filling being Cytrel, a cellulose-based tobacco substitute. In present day the addition of Cytrel has been abandoned, making the cigarette additive-free.\n\nThe brand increased in popularity around the world throughout the 1970s and 1980s as the dangers of cigarette smoking became well known and consumers switched to a lower tar brand. At 5 mg tar, Silk Cut contained less than half the tar content of stronger brands such as Benson and Hedges or Marlboro.\n\nProduction company Gallaher held a Royal Warrant of Appointment for 122 years, until the warrant was revoked in 1999 by Queen Elizabeth II. Her son, the Prince of Wales' rigorous anti-smoking campaigning is thought to have been a major influence behind that decision. Gallaher was allowed one year to remove the Royal Coat of Arms from the brand's packaging.\n\nSilk Cut is also available in a lower tar version and an ultra low tar version with a tar content of only 0.1 mg. When terms such as 'light' and 'low tar' were made illegal to use in the UK for use of tobacco promotion (for fear that it deluded smokers into thinking such products were safer), some commentators predicted that Silk Cut's name and good brand-recognition as a low-tar product would favourably affect sales of the brand to health-conscious consumers. Silk Cut Blue cigarettes contain 0.3 mg Nicotine and Tar content is 3 mg. Silk Cut Silver cigarettes contain 0.1 mg Nicotine and Tar content is 1 mg. Silk Cut White cigarettes contain 0.01 mg Nicotine and Tar content is 0.5 mg. Silk Cut cigarettes are also available in a '100s' range (superking) along with a Menthol flavoured cigarette, too.\n\nIt is a misconception that the tobacco in Silk Cuts contains less nicotine than other cigarette tobacco. The lower nicotine levels are caused by the design of the filter, which has many more holes than regular strength cigarette filters, to mix the smoke with air.\n\nIn 2013, limited edition packs of Silk Cut cigarettes were introduced to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary.\n\nIn the 1970s, Silk Cut was advertised in several popular cinema advertisements, including a parody of the defence of Rorke's Drift, as portrayed in the film Zulu, and of British POWs escaping from a German prison camp.\n\nThe brand was also made popular by a surrealistic advertising campaign launched in 1984, in preparation for a ban on named tobacco advertising.\nBy using the typical colours of the brand, the first surrealistic advertisement of Silk Cut showed a purple silk cloth with a single cut running through it, showing behind it a white background. The name of the cigarette brand never appears on this advertisement, nor are any other objects linked to smoking visible, such as packs of cigarettes or smoke. The only hint for the viewer that this advertisement concerns a cigarette brand at all is the mandatory health warning at the bottom. Based on a series of works by avantgardist artist Lucio Fontana, this first advertisement represented a wordplay on the brand name Silk Cut. This kind of understated advertisement brought together art and life and was unprecedented except for a similar, but not as daring Benson and Hedges campaign in the 1970s.\n\nThe campaign went on to be a huge success, even making Silk Cut the best-selling brand at the beginning of the 1990s. Silk Cut went on to produce many more advertisements in this style, playing with surrealistic themes and pop cultural references, like Man Ray's \"Cadeau\" as well as Alfred Hitchcock's famous shower curtain scene from the movie \"Psycho\"(1960). \nIn later parts of the campaign they also created original surrealistic themes for the ads.\n\nThe main idea behind the use of surrealism for an advertising campaign was to catch the attention of the viewer by giving him or her a riddle to solve, i.e. guessing what product or brand was actually advertised. Only those who could link the images would eventually come to the conclusion that this is an advertisement for the cigarette brand Silk Cut. This worked as a rewarding sensation for the viewer, attaching positive emotions (for successfully solving the riddle) with the brand. But it was also possible to interpret darker and sexual themes into the images of the campaign, even though this was most likely not intended.\n\nAfter a running time of almost two decades, the final poster in the series was in 2002 when all tobacco advertising in the UK was finally banned and showed an opera singer, wearing a purple silk dress which had split at the seams - a reference to the saying 'It's not over until the fat lady sings'.\n\nHowever, sales of Silk Cut cigarettes continued to grow even after the campaign had ended, thanks to sport sponsorship and to many special edition packs, as well as changes on the pack shape, texture, style of opening, cellophane, foil and inner frame. The market share grew 1.1% from 2004 to 2008, and a further 2.9% from 2008 to 2011.\n\nSilk Cut were the title sponsors of rugby league's Challenge Cup for 16 years, between 1985 and 2001, and the competition was known as the 'Silk Cut Challenge Cup'. Silk Cut also sponsored the successful Jaguar XJR sportscars that competed in World Sportscar Championship, including the 24 Heures du Mans, but not in North America because of IMSA's title sponsorship of the GT series by R. J. Reynolds' Camel brand, which would have run the team in violation of the \"Viceroy Rule\". It is now illegal to advertise tobacco in many countries and the adverts have stopped. In the 1990s Silk Cut was the best selling brand in the UK, but sales have declined behind cheaper budget brands as tax on tobacco has increased. In an attempt to counteract this, the manufacturers responded in the new millennium by introducing bevelled corners to redesigned regular gauge packaging, and marketing their first 'slim' cigarette in the UK, even though this wasn't the first 'slim' cigarette available in the UK as More, Karelia and Vogue are available in most tobacconists. Capri were available in the UK until the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 2013, JTI announced it would fight the future introduction of plain packaging laws in the United Kingdom.\n\nGallaher Group, which includes Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut among its brands and is part of tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), is campaigning against Government plans to force cigarettes to be sold in plain packages. In March 2013, Gallaher had three ads challenging the Government's proposals for plain cigarette packaging banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, after complaints from ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) and Cancer Research. The ASA found the ads were \"\"misleading\"\" and lacking \"\"substantiation\"\".\n\nJorge da Motta, the managing director of JTI UK, said: \"\"We are using this media campaign to demonstrate that in 2011, even the Department of Health accepted that these proposals are not supported by any hard evidence. We hope common sense will prevail and that the Government will disregard this proposal, before embarking on a process which will do nothing more than deprive the Treasury of much-needed revenue and make hundreds of millions of pounds for the criminals who manufacture, distribute and sell illegal tobacco products. We have always argued that plain packaging will not prevent children from smoking, but enforcing existing initiatives such as 'No ID, No Sale', punishing those who buy tobacco on the behalf of children and cutting the illegal supply chain, can work\"\".\n\nSilk Cut is mainly sold in the United Kingdom. It was or is exported to Ireland, the Channel Islands, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Malta, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hong Kong, Australia, United States and Antigua.\n\nSilk Cut are the preferred cigarette brand of the DC Comics character, John Constantine.\n\n"}

It is the administrative center of the Feldkirch district. After Dornbirn, it is the second most populous town in Vorarlberg, slightly larger than the state capital of Bregenz. The westernmost point in Austria lies in Feldkirch on the river Rhine, at the northern tripoint between Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe beautiful medieval town, which remains well preserved to this day, was mentioned as a city for the first time in 1218, after Count Hugo von Montfort built the \"Schattenburg\", a castle which still is the major landmark of Feldkirch. Other sights in the town include the cathedral of St. Nikolaus from the late Gothic period. Feldkirch was the birthplace of Rheticus, and is currently the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Feldkirch. From 1651–1773 and from 1856–1979, Feldkirch was the home of the Jesuit school Stella Matutina.\n\nMarch 1799 saw two clashes between the forces of the First French Republic and the Habsburg Monarchy. On the 7th, Nicolas Oudinot with 9,000 French soldiers defeated Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze with 6,000 Austrians. The Battle of Feldkirch occurred on 23 March when André Masséna and 12,000 Frenchmen were beaten by Franz Jellacic and 5,500 Austrians.\n\n\nFeldkirch has had its own local bus network since 1993, which currently consists of 8 lines, including buses which run to the north of neighbouring Liechtenstein. The bus system works together with Vorarlberg's bus system which provides several supra-regional lines starting and ending in Feldkirch.\nThere's an additional line called \"nightline\" which connects different bars and discos all around Feldkirch. The nightline plies until around 4 a.m. on weekends.\n\nFeldkirch railway station lies on the main railway line through the Vorarlberg, with inter-city services to Zurich and Vienna. There are also local international trains to Buchs via Liechtenstein on the Feldkirch–Buchs railway.\n\n, 13,146 employees were employed by 1,464 companies in Feldkirch, including 5 large companies each employing more than 200 people.\n\nThe following companies are based in Feldkirch:\n\nFeldkirch has one of the best preserved medieval cityscapes of Vorarlberg. The city was built around 1200 at the same time as the Schattenburg and has a geometric grid system. Since around 1500, when the city wall was rebuilt, the city remained unchanged over the centuries.\n\nSince 2015, the Feldkirch Ensemble has been listed in the Austrian List of Cultural Heritage (cultural property protected by the Hague Convention). The city is also a member of the Association of small historic towns, a tourism marketing association.\n\nThe streets of the Schlossgraben, Hirschgraben and St. Leonhardsplatz marked the former course of the city wall surrounding the Neustadt area in the 13th century. The wall was largely rebuilt around 1500 and since 1826 in many places abraded.\n\nAs long as Feldkirch was surrounded by a city wall and a city moat, one could enter the city only through one of the four gates. These city gates were called Bregenzertor or Nikolaustor, Bludenzertor or Schultor, Milltor or Sautor, and Churertor or Salztor. The last two gates are still standing, the other two were removed together with the city wall at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n\nIn the 19th century the Feldkirch bourgeoisie built a number of prestigious residential buildings, most of which are still privately owned. The villas were built mostly on the Reichsstraße and here mainly in the area between the Bärenkreuzung and the train station.\n\nThe Poolbar Festival is a modern music and culture festival in Feldkirch. Being held annually between July and August, it attracts around 20,000 visitors featuring music, exhibitions, poetry slams, fashion and an architectural prize. It was first held in 1994 as a cultural summer-academy and is, in organization and implementation of landscape and architecture, very different from other open-air events.\n\nFeldkirch is the home of the Feldkirch Festival, an annual summer festival founded in 2002 by Thomas Hengelbrock and directed since 2007 by Philippe Arlaud.\n\nFeldkirch has a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Inter-dining refers to the act of dining within one's own caste, and excluding others. The practice of Anna Dharmam may have emerged in association with inter-dining.\n\nInter-dining was an important activity that originated in the gatherings of Ayyavazhi. People of different castes would travel bringing with them food materials for cooking their meals when they came to meet Ayya Vaikundar. Food, with its ritual significance, was distributed to the needy and to all those gathered around Ayya Vaikundar. They cooked and ate in the presence of Ayya Vaikundar. This common place action evolved into a significant practice of inter-dining between persons of different groups, cutting across the boundaries of caste restrictions. This practice, being performed in a religious setting with certain measure of earnestness and respect, seems to have acquired the character of a ritual too.\n\nToday, the food being served as Anna Dharmam is known as Unpan Annam, literally meaning \"the food to be eaten,\" and it has its own specific method of preparation. Rice, vegetables, and spices are cooked and mixed together for the purpose. Then it is served ceremoniously. When it is served, the partakers wait until everyone is served. Then a question is posed customarily by the partakers: \"Ayya annam kutikkalama ?\" (Ayya, may we eat the meal?) and when it is answered by those who serve as \"Ayya annam kutiyunkal\" (You may kindly eat the meal), the partakers eat the meal. This was to ensure that everyone got the meal. The poor and the rich - all partake of this meal without discrimination. It was considered as a religious virtue to partake of this meal. \n\nAnother variant of Anna Dharmam known as Palvaippu, the serving of 'gruel-like food boiled in milk.' Presently, every center of worship of Ayyavazhi has this practice once a month. Anna Dharmam in one form or the other is a daily feature in most of the worship centres of Ayyavazhi, For instance, Swamithoppe practice it daily.\n\n"}

{"id": "2186735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186735", "title": "Medieval football", "text": "Medieval football\n\n\"Medieval football\" is a modern term used for a wide variety of localised football games which were invented and played in Europe during the Middle Ages. Alternative names include folk football, mob football and Shrovetide football. These games may be regarded as the ancestors of modern codes of football, and by comparison with later forms of football, the medieval matches were chaotic and had few rules.\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a rise in popularity of games played annually at Shrovetide throughout Europe, particularly in Great Britain. The games played in England at this time may have arrived with the Roman occupation but there is little evidence to indicate this. Certainly the Romans played ball games, in particular Harpastum. There is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. In the ninth century Nennius's \"Historia Brittonum\" tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (\"pilae ludus\"). The origin of this account is either Southern England or Wales. References to a ball game played in northern France known as \"La Soule\" or \"Choule\", in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.\n\nThese archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played in towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers at each end of a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. Sometimes instead of markers, the teams would attempt to kick the bladder into the balcony of the opponents' church. A legend that these games in England evolved from a more ancient and bloody ritual of kicking the \"Dane's head\" is unlikely to be true. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways. In spite of this, games continued to be played in some parts of the United Kingdom and still survive in a number of towns, notably the Ba game played at Christmas and New Year at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands Scotland, Uppies and Downies over Easter at Workington in Cumbria, and the Royal Shrovetide Football Match on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday at Ashbourne in Derbyshire, England.\n\nFew images of medieval football survive. One engraving from the early fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards each other with a ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.\n\nMost of the very early references to the game speak simply of \"ball play\" or \"playing at ball\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.\n\nThe earliest account of ball games being played in post-classical Europe comes from the 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\", attributed to the monk Nennius. The text, written in Wales, mentions a group of boys \"playing at ball\" (pilae ludus).\n\nThe earliest reference from France which provides evidence of the playing of ball games (presumably La soule) comes in 1147. This refers to the handing over of \"seven balloons of greatest dimension\". An early description of ball games that are likely to be football in England was given by William FitzStephen (c. 1174 – 1183). He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:\n\nThe earliest confirmation that such ball games in England involved kicking comes from a verse about Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. This was probably written in the thirteenth century, being recorded by Matthew Paris, although the precise date is not known: \"Four and twenty bonny boys, were playing at the ball.. he kicked the ball with his right foot\".\n\nIn about 1200 \"ball\" is mentioned as one of the games played by King Arthur's knights in \"Brut\", written by Layamon, an English poet from Worcestershire. This is the earliest reference to the English language \"ball\". Layamon states: \"some drive balls (balles) far over the fields\". Records from 1280 report on a game at Ulgham, near Ashington in Northumberland, in which a player was killed as a result of running against an opposing player's dagger. This account is noteworthy because it is the earliest reference to an English ball game that definitely involved kicking; this suggests that kicking was involved in even earlier ball games in England. In Cornwall in 1283 plea rolls No. 111. mention a man named Roger who was accused of striking a fellow player in a game of \"soule\" with a stone, a blow which proved fatal.\n\nThe earliest reference to ball games being played by university students comes in 1303 when \"Thomas of Salisbury, a student of Oxford University, found his brother Adam dead, and it was alleged that he was killed by Irish students, whilst playing the ball in the High Street towards Eastgate\".\n\nIn 1314, comes the earliest reference to a game called football when Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree on behalf of King Edward II banning football. It was written in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: \"[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [\"rageries de grosses pelotes de pee\"] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.\"\n\nAnother early account of kicking ball games from England comes in a 1321 dispensation, granted by Pope John XXII to William de Spalding of Shouldham:\n\"To William de Spalding, canon of Scoldham of the order of Sempringham. During the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his, also called William, ran against him and wounded himself on a sheathed knife carried by the canon, so severely that he died within six days. Dispensation is granted, as no blame is attached to William de Spalding, who, feeling deeply the death of his friend, and fearing what might be said by his enemies, has applied to the pope.\"\n\nBanning of ball games began in France in 1331 by Philip VI, presumably the ball game known as La soule.\nIn the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows two young men playing a ball game. It looks as though they are using their hands for the game; however, kicking certainly cannot be excluded. Most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.\n\nKing Edward III of England also issued such a declaration, in 1363: \"[m]oreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\". At this time football was already being differentiated in England from handball, which suggests the evolution of basic rules. Between 1314 and 1667, football was officially banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws. (See the article Attempts to ban football games for more details.)\n\nLikewise Geoffrey Chaucer offered an allusion to the manner in which contemporary ball games may have been played in fourteenth-century England. In the \"Canterbury Tales\" (written some time after 1380) he uses the following line: \"rolleth under foot as doth a ball\".\n\nEnglish Theologian John Wycliffe (1320–1384) referred to football in one of his sermons: \"and now þei clouten þer shone wiþ censuris, as who shulde chulle a foot-balle\" It may be the earliest use of the word \"football\" in English.\n\nThat football was known at the turn of the century in Western England comes from about 1400 when the West Midland Laud Troy War Book states in English: \"Hedes reled aboute overal As men playe at the fote-ball\"\n\nTwo references to football games come from Sussex in 1403 and 1404 at Selmeston and Chidham as part of baptisms. On each occasion one of the players broke his leg\n\nKing Henry IV of England provides an early documented use of the English word \"football\" when in 1409 he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".\n\nOn 4 March 1409, eight men were compelled to give a bond of £20 to the London city chamberlain for their good behaviour towards \"the kind and good men of the mystery of Cordwainers\", undertaking not to collect money for a football (pro pila pedali).\n\nIn 1410, King Henry IV of England found it necessary to impose a fine of 20S on mayors and bailiffs in towns where misdemeanours such as football occurred. This confirms that football was not confined to London.\n\nThe Accounts of the Worshipful Company of Brewers between 1421 and 1423 concerning the hiring out of their hall include reference to \"by the \"footeballepleyers\" twice... 20 pence\" listed in English under the title \"crafts and fraternities\". This reference suggests that bans against football were unsuccessful and the listing of football players as a \"fraternity\" is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club.\n\nThe earliest reference to football or kicking ball games in Scotland was in 1424 when King James I of Scotland also attempted to ban the playing of \"fute-ball\".\n\nIn 1425 the prior of Bicester, England, made a payment on St Katherine's day \"to sundry gifts to football players (ludentibus ad pilam pedalem)\" of 4 denarii. At this time the prior was willing to give his patronage to the game despite its being outlawed.\n\nIn about 1430 Thomas Lydgate refers to the form of football played in East Anglia known as Camp Ball: \"Bolseryd out of length and bread, lyck a large campynge balle\"\n\nIn 1440 the game of Camp Ball was confirmed to be a form of football when the first ever English-Latin dictionary, \"Promptorium parvulorum\" offers the following definition of camp ball: \"Campan, or playar at foott balle, pediluson; campyon, or champion\".\n\nIn 1472 the rector of Swaffham, Norfolk bequeathed a field adjoining the church yard for use as a \"camping-close\" or \"camping-pightel\" specifically for the playing of the East Anglian version of football known as Camp Ball.\n\nIn 1486 comes the earliest description of \"a football\", in the sense of a ball rather than a game. This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' \"Book of St Albans\". It states: \"a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal.\" It was considered socially acceptable for a football to be included in medieval English Heraldry.\n\nThere is an account from 11 April 1497 of a sum of money \"giffen [given] to Jame Dog [James Doig] to b[u]y fut ballis to the King\".. It is not known if he himself played with them.\n\nThe earliest and perhaps most important description of a football game comes from the end of the 15th century in a Latin account of a football game with features of modern soccer. It was played at Cawston, Nottinghamshire, England. It is included in a manuscript collection of the miracles of King Henry VI of England. Although the precise date is uncertain it certainly comes from between 1481 and 1500. This is the first account of an exclusively \"kicking game\" and the first description of dribbling: \"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions\" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football field, stating that: \"[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started. Nevertheless the game was still rough, as the account confirms: \"a game, I say, abominable enough . . . and rarely ending but with some loss, accident, or disadvantage of the players themselves.\"\n\nMedieval sport had no referee.\n\nIn 1510 comes the next description of early football by Alexander Barclay, a resident of the South East of England:\nThey get the bladder and blowe it great and thin, with many beanes and peason put within, It ratleth, shineth and soundeth clere and fayre, While it is throwen and caste up in the eyre, Eche one contendeth and hath a great delite, with foote and hande the bladder for to smite, if it fall to the ground they lifte it up again... Overcometh the winter with driving the foote-ball.\nThe first record of a pair of football boots occurs when Henry VIII of England ordered a pair from the Great Wardrobe in 1526. The royal shopping list for footwear states: \"45 velvet pairs and 1 leather pair for football\". Unfortunately these are no longer in existence. It is not known for certain whether the king himself played the game, but if so this is noteworthy as his son Edward VI later banned the game in 1548 because it incited riots.\n\nThe reputation of football as a violent game persists throughout most accounts from 16th-century England. In 1531, Sir Thomas Elyot noted in his \"Boke named The Governour\" the dangers of football, as well as the benefits of archery (\"shooting\"):\n\nSome men wolde say, that in mediocritie, whiche I haue so moche praised in shootynge, why shulde nat boulynge, claisshe, pynnes, and koytyng be as moche commended? Verily as for two the laste, be to be utterly abiected of al noble men, in like wise foote balle, wherin is nothinge but beastly furie and extreme violence; wherof procedeth hurte, and consequently rancour and malice do remaine with them that be wounded; wherfore it is to be put in perpetuall silence. In class she is emploied to litle strength; in boulyng oftentimes to moche; wherby the sinewes be to moche strayned, and the vaines to moche chafed. Wherof often tymes is sene to ensue ache, or the decreas of strength or agilitie in the armes: where, in shotyng, if the shooter use the strength of his bowe within his owne tiller, he shal neuer be therwith grieued or made more feble.\nAlthough many sixteenth-century references to football are disapproving or dwell upon their dangers there are two notable departures from this view. First, Sir Thomas Elyot (although previously a critic of the game) advocates \"footeball\" as part of what he calls vehement exercise in his Castell of Helth published in 1534. Secondly English headmaster Richard Mulcaster provides in his 1581 publication the earliest evidence of organised, refereed football for small teams playing in formation.\n\nThe first reference to football in Ireland occurs in the \"Statute of Galway\" of 1527, which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned \" 'hokie' — the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\" as well as other sports. (The earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712.)\n\nThe oldest surviving ball that might have been used for football games dates to about 1540 and comes from Scotland. It is made from leather and a pig's bladder. It was discovered in 1981 in the roof structure of the Queen's Chamber, Stirling Castle. Whilst other uses for the ball, such as pallone, have been suggested, most notably by the National Museum of Scotland, due to its size (diameter 14–16 cm), staff at the Stirling Smith Museum and researchers at the Scottish Football Museum have attributed its use to football, citing the description of the ball used in the Carlisle Castle game of 1568.\n\nThe violence of early football in Scotland is made clear in this sixteenth-century poem on the \"beauties of football\":\n\nThe earliest specific reference to football (pila pedalis) at a university comes in 1555 when it was outlawed at St John's College, Oxford. Similar decrees followed shortly after at other Oxford Colleges and at Cambridge University.\n\nAnother reference occurred in 1555, when Antonio Scaino published his treatise \"Del Giuoco della Palla\" (\"On the Game of the Ball\"). It was mostly concerned with a medieval predecessor of tennis, but near the end, Scaino included a chapter titled, \"Del Giuoco del Calcio\" (\"On the Game of Football\"), for comparison. According to Scaino, the game was popular with students. It could be played with any number of players. The only rules seem to be that weapons could not be brought onto the field, and the ball could not be thrown by hand. The goal was for each team to try to cross the ball across a marked space at the opposite end of the field. To start, the ball was placed in the middle of the field and kicked by a member of the team that was chosen by lots. Scaino remarks that its chief entertainment for the spectators was to see \"the players fall in great disarray & upside down.\"\n\nIn 1568 Sir Francis Knollys described a football game played at Carlisle Castle, Cumbria, England by the retinue of Mary Queen of Scots: `20 of her retinue played at football before her for two hours very strongly, nimbly, and skilfully\". According to contemporary sources and detailed publications Mary's retinue was predominantly Scottish, made up primarily by nobles who had followed her south in the aftermath of the Battle of Langside.\n\nThe first official rules of Calcio Fiorentino (Florentine kick) were recorded in 1580, although the game had been developing around Florence for some time before that date. The game involved teams of 27 kicking and carrying a ball in a giant sandpit set up in the Piazza Santa Croce in the centre of Florence, both teams aiming for their designated point on the perimeter of the sandpit.\n\nIn 1586, men from a ship commanded by English explorer John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.\n\nIn Wales, the game of \"cnapan\" was described at length by George Owen of Henllys, an eccentric historian of Pembrokeshire, in 1603:\"\"This game... is thought to be of great antiquity and is as followeth. The ancient Britons being naturally a warlike nation did no doubt for the exercise of their youth in time of peace and to avoid idleness devise games of activity where each man might show his natural prowess and agility... About one or two of the clock afternoon begins the play, in this sort, after a cry made both parties draw to into some plain, all first stripped bare saving a light pair of breeches, bare-headed, bare-bodied, bare legs and feet...The foot company thus meeting, there is a round ball prepared of a reasonable quantity so as a man may hold it in his hand and no more, this ball is of some massy wood as box, yew, crab or holly tree and should be boiled in tallow for m make it slippery and hard to hold. This ball is called cnapan and is by one of the company hurling bolt upright into the air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen the chase to follow two miles and more...\"\"\n\nThe earliest account of a ball game that involves passing of the ball comes from Richard Carew's 1602 account of Cornish Hurling which states \"Then must he cast the ball (named Dealing) to some one of his fellowes\". Carew also offers the earliest description of a goal (they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue score off,\nother twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales\") and of goal keepers (\"There is assigned for their gard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers\").\n\nThe first direct reference to \"scoring a goal\" is in John Day's play \"The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green\" (performed circa 1600; published 1659): \"I'll play a gole at camp-ball\" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to \"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\".\nIn 1615 James I of England visited Wiltshire and the villagers \"entertained his Majesty with a foot-ball match\"\n\nOliver Cromwell who left Cambridge University in 1617 was described by James Heath as \"one of the chief matchmakers and players of football\" during his time at the university.\n\nIn 1623 Edmund Waller refers in one of his poems to \"football\" and alludes to teamwork and passing the ball: \"They ply their feet, and still the restless ball, Toss'd to and fro, is urged by them all\". In 1650 Richard Baxer gives an interesting description of football in his book Everlasting Rest: \"Alas, that I must stand by and see the Church, and Cause of Christ, like a Football in the midst of a crowd of Boys, tost about in contention from one to another... and may drive it before him. ... But to be spurned about in the dirt, till they have driven it on to the goal of their private interests\". This is noteworthy as it confirms that passing of the ball from one player to another was part of football games.\n\nThe first study of football as part of early sports is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games,\n\nwritten in about 1660. This account is particularly noteworthy as he refers to football by its correct name in English and is the first to describe the following: modern goals and a pitch (\"a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals\"), tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"), scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\"). He is the first to describe a law of football: \"They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball\". His account of the ball itself is also informative: \"They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in\". He adds: \"The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still\". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch.\n\n\nIn Scotland the Ba' game (\"Ball Game\") can be found at:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was older than his brother Umar. He is described as \"a very tall dark man\".\n\nHe gave his brother Umar a chance to go with Quraysh's trade caravan and trade with Syria's traders and always showed kindness and love to Umar.\n\nHe became a Muslim sometime before August 616. He joined the general emigration to Medina in 622 and was made the brother in Islam of Maan ibn Adi.\n\nHis marriage to his cousin, Atiqa bint Zayd, was childless and ended in divorce. In Medina he married two women from the Amr clan of the Aws tribe. One was Habiba bint Abi Amir, who bore him a daughter, Asma; Habiba's niece Jamila was briefly married to Zayd's brother Umar. The other was Lubaba, a daughter of Abu Lubaba ibn Abd al-Mundhir, who was the mother of his son Abdulrahman.\n\nHe fought at the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud, the Battle of the Ditch and \"all the battles with Allah's Messenger\". At Uhud Umar urged Zayd to borrow his armour. Zayd put it on but then he took it off again, saying, \"I want what you want for yourself.\"\n\nAt the Battle of Yamama on December 632, Zayd carried the Muslims' standard. When Muslim baggage was exposed to plunder by the enemy, Zayd said, \"As for the baggage, there is no baggage! As for the men, there are no men!\" Then he shouted, \"O Allah, I apologise for the flight of my companions! I am not guilty before Thee of what Musaylimah and Muhakkam have done!\" Zayd continued to hold the standard while fighting with his sword and he did not drop it until he was killed. His killer was Abu Maryam al-Hanafi, who claimed: \"Allah honoured him at my hand and did not weaken me at his hand.\" He was martyred seconds after his second cousins, Abdullah ibn Suhail and Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba, and adopted distant relative (possibly nephew), Salim Mawla Abu Hudhayfa.\n\nHis tomb in Uyaynah was a site of veneration until around 1740 when Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab campaigned to have it leveled.\n\n"}
{"id": "2186740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186740", "title": "Frak!", "text": "Frak!\n\nFrak! is a 1980s computer game originally programmed in machine code by Nick Pelling for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron and published by his own 'Aardvark' software label in 1984. The game was noted for its \"outstanding\" graphics, with its characters being compared in one review to early Disney cartoons.\n\nThe game was ported to the Commodore 64 the following year by 'The B Team' (Jason Perkins, Anthony Clarke and Mark Rodgers). The BBC and Electron versions were included on the Superior Software compilation \"Play It Again Sam 4\" in 1987 and re-issued in budget form by 'Alternative Software' in 1989.\n\n\"Frak!\" is a side scrolling platform game in which the player controls a caveman named Trogg. In each level, Trogg's object is to find three keys located on the level. The platforms and ladders (replaced by logs, ropes and chains on later levels) constituting the level are laid out in a very tricky form. When Trogg steps off a platform, he does not fall straight down, but instead slides diagonally downwards. Added to the fact that long falls will kill Trogg, this calls for very skilful jumping among the platforms. Trogg exclaims \"Frak!\" (presumably an expletive) each time he dies. When the user manages to complete the three levels, they are returned to the first level with the screen display upside down. The game then repeats the same three stage sequence, following which it rotates 90 degrees and repeats again. Subsequent loops consist of video being displayed in black and white and rotated, and also the display being flashed on and off in three second intervals.\n\nEnemies in \"Frak!\" come in three forms: the large, hairy Scrubbly, pig-like Poglet and large-nosed Hooter (each static, as 'statues'), balloons and daggers. The statues obviously stay still, whereas the balloons fly straight upwards and the daggers fly diagonally downwards. Contact with any enemy will kill Trogg. To combat the enemies, Trogg is armed with a yo-yo that he can launch straight horizontally. The yo-yo will kill any enemy it comes into contact with.\n\nEach level also has a time-limit, which can be topped up by the occasionally found light bulbs. However, if the time runs out, the level does not end - instead, the game continues in the dark. After this point, the yo-yo can still be used to remove the static enemies from the level but will not affect balloons and daggers.\n\n\"Frak!\" encodes high scores as nonsensical secret messages, such as \"Hairy gonks kiss green Buddhas slowly\".\n\nWhen the original BBC Micro version was converted for the Acorn Electron, the screen mode was changed from four colours to two because of the Electron's inferior video speed. The extra RAM freed up by the smaller frame buffer made it possible to include extra levels (bringing the total to nine against the BBC's three) and a screen designer which was not in the BBC original. The C64 version was written by MicroProjects Limited (Jason Perkins, Anthony Clarke & Mark Rogers) who were subcontracted by Statesoft to do the conversion. It has six levels. The BBC version had a higher resolution than the C64 and so some of the active playing area was off the screen, and has a distinct graphical style and catchy background music (different for each level).\n\nIn the 1990s, an attempt was made to port \"Frak!\" to the Amiga, with updated graphics (including \"frak!tals\" in the background), but the port was never finished.\n"}

The son of former Green Bay Packers executive Bob Harlan, he broadcasts NFL and college basketball games on CBS and is a play-by-play announcer for the \"NBA on TNT\". Until 2008, Harlan was the voice of Westwood One Radio's Final Four coverage. In 2010, he began serving as Westwood One's lead announcer for \"Monday Night Football\", calling his first Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLV. He has broadcast 10 consecutive Super Bowls for Westwood One, Super Bowls XLV-LIV. Ten is the most consecutively in radio, and television, network history (Jack Buck broadcast 9 straight.) Harlan also broadcast the CBS HD feed of Super Bowl XXXV in 2001. He also calls the preseason games of his hometown Packers for the team's statewide television network since 2003. In 2017 and 2019, he was voted the National Sportscaster of the Year by his peers. In all, Harlan has broadcast 11 Super Bowls and 5 Final Fours.\n\nHarlan began broadcasting as a teenager for his alma mater Our Lady of Premontre High School's high school radio station, WGBP-FM, calling play-by-play for the school's boy's basketball, football and ice hockey teams. He was a ball boy with the Green Bay Packers in his teens during the time that his father, Bob Harlan, was a Packers executive in the front office. He had originally pursued attending either the University of Wisconsin–Madison or the University of Notre Dame in pursuit of his communications/mass media degree, but a personal recommendation from broadcaster Gary Bender to his dad Bob led Kevin to instead attend the University of Kansas and its School of Journalism and Mass Communications. Harlan was introduced to the Jayhawks' primary basketball play-by-play announcer at the time, Tom Hedrick, who audited Harlan's zeal for sports broadcasting and immediately considered him a protege in the making. Hedrick gave Harlan a sideline position his freshman year, eventually deeming him as his understudy and fill-in announcer on days where he had other commitments. Harlan graduated in 1982 with a broadcast journalism degree. \n\nIn 1982, right out of college, at age 22, he became the TV and radio voice of the NBA's Kansas City Kings (now the Sacramento Kings). He then was a basketball announcer for his alma mater, the University of Kansas, for one year, then went on to call games for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs from 1985–93 after several years hosting and producing surrounding pre-game and post-game programming while still in college. Harlan also split time with the University of Missouri (1986–89) calling football and basketball games, and worked as the play-by-play voice of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves for nine seasons (1989–98). On the network level, Harlan called NFL football for NBC in 1991, college football for ESPN in 1992–93, NFL for Fox from 1994–97, and joined Turner Sports in 1996 to broadcast NBA playoff games (he would begin calling games throughout the entire season in 1997, which he continues to do to this day). He began working for CBS in 1998.\n\nIn addition, Harlan has called Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears, and Green Bay Packers preseason games; boxing for Mike Tyson vs. Buster Mathis Jr. in 1995; basketball games during the now-defunct Goodwill Games, which were owned by Time Warner; college sports on ESPN; and several bowl games during college football seasons. Harlan has also lent his voice on the \"NBA 2K\" video game series since 2005.\n\nIn 2017, Harlan was voted by his peers National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA. He again was voted National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA in 2019. \nHe was also named 2019 National Sportscaster of the Year by The Athletic. In September 2019 Harlan was inducted into the Notre Dame Academy High School Hall of Fame (the former Premontre HS he attended in Green Bay, Wisconsin.)\n\nHarlan has a history of injecting humor into situations during games whenever he can, in addition to being able to dramatize even mundane moments not related to the game itself. These include:\n\nMay 12, 2008 – Harlan was calling the 2008 Eastern Conference Semifinals featuring the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers, when Cavaliers superstar LeBron James drove to the basket and emphatically dunked on Celtics forward Kevin Garnett. Harlan's call of the play:\n\nHarlan: Garnett comes out on LeBron. Now they switch and here's Pierce again...a Smith screen. Posey will defend...OHHHHHH! LEBRON JAMES WITH \"NO REGARD\" FOR HUMAN LIFE!\n\nSeptember 12, 2016 – Harlan was the radio play-by-play man for Westwood One's coverage of the \"Monday Night Football\" game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams, where a fan ran onto the field. Harlan then proceeded to give a play-by-play of security chasing the man. Deadspin referred to the call as an \"All Timer\".\"Hey, somebody has run out on the field. Some goofball in a hat and a red shirt. Now he takes off the shirt! He’s running down the middle by the \"50\"! He’s at the \"30\"! He’s bare-chested and banging his chest. Now, he runs the opposite way. He runs to the \"50\"! He runs to the \"40\"! The guy is \"drunk\"! But there he \"goes\"! The 20 — they’re chasing him, but they’re not going to get him. \"Waving his arms, bare-chested\"; Somebody stop that man! \"[Referring to the security]\" \"Oh\", they got him, they’re coming from the left — Oh and they \"tackle\" him at the 40-yard line! \"[Pause] Whew,\" that was the most exciting thing to happen tonight.\"\n\nJanuary 12, 2018 – Harlan called the NFC Divisional Match-up between the New Orleans Saints and Minnesota Vikings for Westwood One Radio, where Stefon Diggs scored on a 61 yard touchdown pass from Case Keenum as time expired, now known as the Minneapolis Miracle. It's third down and 10. Keenum is in the gun from his own 39. Four man front, six in the secondary. Shotgun snap. He moves up, he moves up, he throws a long line drive on the near side, leaping to and catch made! It's made by – oh my goodness, it's gonna go in for the touchdown! Grabbed by Diggs! He broke a tackle! 61 yard touchdown throw! THE VIKINGS HAVE WON! THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS HAVE WON!\n\nMay 12, 2019 – Harlan called Game 7 of the 2019 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals with analyst Greg Anthony, where Kawhi Leonard hit a shot at the buzzer that bounced four times before falling in to win the game and advance the Toronto Raptors to the Eastern Conference Finals. Harlan's call of the play:Harlan: It's off to Leonard, defended by Simmons. Is this the dagger?\n\n\"[ball bounces four times on the rim, proceeds to go in as buzzer sounds]\"\n\nHarlan and Anthony: OHHHHHH!\n\nHarlan: GAME! SERIES! TORONTO HAS WON!\n\nNov 4, 2019 – Harlan was the radio play-by-play for Westwood One's coverage of a Monday Night Football game between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants where a black cat ran onto the field midway in the second quarter. \n\n\"Oh and there cat, a cat black has taken the field. A black cat is running from the 20 to the nearside the 10, from the 39 of Dallas here is a short throw down the middle caught by Engram. Caught at the 35 to the 30, now the cat running the other way and so is Ingram at the 25 near the 24 yard line of the Dallas Cowboys. It's a catch-run of 15. Now the cat is stopped at the 50 ... he's at the eight ... now he is at the five ... he's walking to the three, he's at the two... and the cat is in the CDW Red Zone... now a policeman, a state trooper is on the field- AND THE CAT RUNS IN THE END ZONE! THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN!\"\n\nNov 10, 2019 – The following Sunday, Harlan was the play-by-play announcer for a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals. With Baltimore up 28–13 against Cincinnati, Ravens quarterback and MVP favorite Lamar Jackson used a spin move to elude several Bengals defenders for a 47-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, putting the game out of reach. \n\n\"Here's a second down and 3, Jackson takes it himself. Look at him dart back and forth- OHHHHHH! HE BROKE HIS ANKLES! NOW HE'S GOT AN ENTOURAGE! And he's got a touchdown! HE IS HOUDINI! What a play! 47-yard touchdown run by the magical quarterback Lamar Jackson! WOW!\"\n\nDec 29, 2019 – Harlan was the television play-by-play commentator for the Los Angeles Chargers at the Kansas City Chiefs when he began calling the Miami Dolphins at the New England Patriots game in the Chargers vs Chiefs feed; with a New England loss, the Chiefs would claim the #2 seed in the playoffs and a bye week. Meanwhile, Miami has first and goal down by four. And they're at the New England four yard line, first and goal. 29 seconds left. Here (in Kansas City) Butker kicks the extra point. And Fitzpatrick throws in the end zone, touchdown Miami! The Dolphins have just scored! Gesicki, the tight end, got a laser in the back of the end zone on a goal-to-go touchdown pass by Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to take a lead with 24 seconds to go! The extra point coming up for Miami, leading New England 26 to 24. And the crowd now knows it.\n\n... What a throw by Fitzpatrick, what a touchdown run by Williams, on the last weekend of the regular season in the NFL!\n\nRich Gannon, the analyst in the booth with Harlan, asked Harlan \"I'm getting confused, what game are you calling?\", to which Harlan responded with a very enthusiastic \"I'm calling both games!\"\n\nHarlan has been married for over 30 years, and he and his wife have four children. Their daughter, Olivia, is a sideline reporter for ESPN and is married to NBA player Sam Dekker, also born in Wisconsin (in Sheboygan).\n\n"}

Below are just several of the most popular examples.\n\nIn poker, for instance, a cheat may \"crimp\" one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. Similarly, if the card cheat is not working with a confederate, he may bend one or more cards to force a cut upon an unsuspecting victim. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page. \n\nAnother poker scenario (also popular in numerous other games) is to \"crimp\" some of the high-value cards during the early rounds. On subsequent rounds the cheat will be able to identify some of those cards during the deal. This enables the cheat to employ a second deal and deal some of those cards to the desired hand, or simply to identify some of the cards held by other players. In any event, the cheat has a mathematical edge over the other players.\n\nIn casino blackjack a crossroader may \"crimp\" all the 10-value cards. this will enable the cheat to sometimes identify the dealer's hole card (the dealer has one card face up, called the up card, and one card face down, called the hole card). In those instances the cheat(s) will know the dealer's total and play their hand(s) accordingly.\nProfessional card counters and cheaters know that security is on the lookout for “cheating tells” - special behaviors which casinos train security to spot.\n"}

In 2015 and 2017 a total of four new 'Hunt Class' catamarans were purchased for use primarily on the RB6 Service.\n\nMBNA Thames Clippers operate under licence from Transport for London. The river boat service is now better integrated into the tube and bus ticketing network. From November 2009, the MBNA Thames Clippers services started to accept Oyster pay as you go on all of its services, which also provides a discount on single and return fares. Contactless payment is also accepted.\n\nA River Roamer ticket, valid for one day, is available from MBNA Thames Clipper which allows the holder to hop on and hop off along the banks of the Thames between Battersea Power Station Pier and Woolwich Arsenal Pier (including the Canary Wharf - Rotherhithe Ferry). The cost is £19.80 for an adult and £39.60 for a family. An adult single trip fare changes depending on zones. They range from £4.40 to £9.90 (or £3.90 to £7.50 if payment is made online, in app or with an oyster or contactless card). \nThere is a one third discount for holders of valid travelcards (excluding Family River Roamer tickets and fares for The O2 Express).\n\nSpecial river service season tickets, valid for either 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year, are also available. Discounts for travelcard holders are also available on season tickets.\n\nThis runs between Westminster Millennium Pier (on the north side of the river by Westminster Underground station) and the Woolwich Arsenal Pier (on the south side of the river in Woolwich). The service runs every 20 minutes during the day, and every 30 minutes in the very early morning and evenings.\nStops include from west to east:\n\nMBNA Thames Clippers operates the direct cross river Canary Wharf - Rotherhithe Ferry, between Canary Wharf Pier and the Nelson Dock Pier at the Hilton Hotel in Rotherhithe. The service uses smaller boats than the commuter service but runs at a higher frequency of every 20 minutes and every 10 minutes during peak times. The ferry can be used by guests of the hotel free of charge as well as by passengers not staying at the hotel at a cost.\n\nOperates Every 30 minutes on weekends. Service RB1 serves Woolwich Arsenal Mondays to Fridays (Mornings and Evenings only) \n\nThis runs peak times Monday to Friday only. Stops are:\n\nIn September 2017, Thames Clippers ran a trial commuter service between Gravesend and Central London.\n\nThe Tate to Tate and Service West operates between Battersea Pier and London Bridge Pier, serving visitors travelling between the Tate Modern museum on the South Bank and the older Tate Britain in Millbank across the river.\n\nThe O Express is an express service calling at London Eye, Westminster Pier, Embankment Pier, London Bridge City Pier, Tower Pier, Greenwich Pier and North Greenwich Pier for The O. The service also provides private charters.\n\nMBNA Thames Clippers operates 16 high-speed catamarans with a maximum speed of , plus a more conventional catamaran for the Hilton ferry.\n\nIn February 2004, a woman was killed after she was hit, while waiting for a boat, by a mooring bollard which had come loose from the Star Clipper at St. Katherine's Pier.\n\nOn 4 October 2011 at 7 pm, the Moon Clipper hit the Tower Millennium Pier when it was carrying about 50 people. No fatalities.\n\nOn 5 December 2016 the Typhoon Clipper collided with the workboat Alison, resulting in the sinking of the workboat. No fatalities.\n\nA Policy Exchange report advocates significant expansion in river services on the Thames. The aim of the report is to lead to a \"river tube line\" being created which would lead to easing of current congestion on London's transport systems, and better quality of travel, at a significantly cheaper price than other options. Opponents note that the river capacity, especially at low tide could mean a reduction of tourist boats (especially at peak commuter times), and turn the Thames into urban highway which would be detrimental to London. To be feasible, the report calls for better management of river traffic, improved interchange with other public transport modes and expansion of key piers.\n\nThe Mayor of London is responsible for the River Concordat group group, which is made-up of over forty different organisations including Thames Clippers. The publication, By the River , sets out the strategic vision for improving river transport on the Thames.\n\nThey plan to expand further East down the river start with a calling at a Pier in Silvertown in October 2019 and plans in the future to go to Thamesmead and Barking.\n\n"}

It is a catalyst for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis in organic synthesis. This dark brown powder is commercially available. The oxide itself is not an active catalyst, but it becomes active after exposure to hydrogen whereupon it converts to platinum black, which is responsible for reactions.\n\nAdams' catalyst is prepared from chloroplatinic acid HPtCl or ammonium chloroplatinate, (NH)PtCl, by fusion with sodium nitrate. The first published preparation was reported by V. Voorhees and Roger Adams. The procedure involves first preparing a platinum nitrate which is then heated to expel nitrogen oxides.\n\nThe resulting brown cake is washed with water to free it from nitrates. The catalyst can either be used as is or dried and stored in a desiccator for later use. Platinum can be recovered from spent catalyst by conversion to ammonium chloroplatinate using aqua regia followed by ammonia.\n\nAdams' catalyst is used for many applications. It has shown to be valuable for hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and oxidation reactions. During the reaction, platinum metal (platinum black) is formed which has been cited to be the active catalyst. Hydrogenation occurs with syn stereochemistry when used on an alkyne resulting in a cis-alkene. Some of the most important transformations include the hydrogenation of ketones to alcohols or ethers (the latter product forming in the presence of alcohols and acids) and the reduction of nitro compounds to amines. However, reductions of alkenes can be performed with Adam's catalyst in the presence of nitro groups without reducing the nitro group. When reducing nitro compounds to amines, platinum catalysts are preferred over palladium catalysts to minimize hydrogenolysis. The catalyst is also used for the hydrogenolysis of phenyl phosphate esters, a reaction that does not occur with palladium catalysts. The pH of the solvent significantly affects the reaction course, and reactions of the catalyst are often enhanced by conducting the reduction in neat acetic acid, or solutions of acetic acid in other solvents.\n\nPrior to the development of Adams' catalyst, organic reductions were carried out using colloidal platinum or platinum black. The colloidal catalysts were more active but posed difficulties in isolating reaction products. This led to more widespread use of platinum black. In Adams' own words:\n\n\"...Several of the problems I assigned my students involved catalytic reduction. For this purpose we were using as a catalyst platinum black made by the generally accepted best method known at the time. The students had much trouble with the catalyst they obtained in that frequently it proved to be inactive even though prepared by the same detailed procedure which resulted occasionally in an active product. I therefore initiated a research to find conditions for preparing this catalyst with uniform activity.\"\n\nLittle precaution is necessary with the oxide but, after exposure to H, the resulting platinum black can be pyrophoric. Therefore, it should not be allowed to dry and all exposure to oxygen should be minimized.\n\n\n"}

The population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 432, increasing to 455 at the 2011 census.\n\nThe village lies largely on the north side of the A6121 road from Uppingham to Stamford. It is divided into two by a small stream, the Foss, which is a tributary of the River Chater.\n\nThe village has two pubs, the Boot and Shoe and the Coach House (previously the Halfway House), as well as the parish church and the village hall. South Luffenham Hall stands a short distance to the south-east of St Mary's church. There is a ruined windmill to the east of the village.\n\nLuffenham railway station was located to the north of the village and also served the neighbouring village of North Luffenham. The railway station opened in 1848 and closed in 1966. In fact, there were two railway stations in the parish, since Morcott station lay just within the South Luffenham parish boundary.\n\nBefore the Second World War, the Earls of Ancaster owned all the farms and most of the cottages, except Church Farm, which belonged to the Conants. The estate was then split up and sold off. In those early days, the village was self-sufficient, having two butchers and one baker. In addition, Bates' carrier journeyed from Barrowden each Friday to convey goods, but no passengers, to Stamford; cash would also be taken to the banks. Joe Kirby came from Barrowden each Saturday afternoon in a covered wagon selling haberdashery. The post came from Stamford by horse and cart, and subsequently by rail to Luffenham station, and whoever kept the village post office was obliged to take the letters round the village.\n\nThe last blacksmith was Mr Pepper from Barrowden who visited twice weekly until 1910. To the south of the smithy, in Back Lane in a shed, was a general grocers store.\n\nIn November 1904, as Edward Berridge of Ketton was delivering bread in South Luffenham, Charles Louth stole a loaf of bread to the value of 2½d, from the cart. He was sentenced to 14 days' hard labour.\n\nAround the village are a number of old lanes little used now as they were of old. Cannonball Lane leads up to Morcott Spinney, so called because it is handed down that Cromwell's men set up his cannons in this spinney from which to fire on North Luffenham.\n\nShocky Balke (baulk meaning a strip of grass between cultivated strips) leads southwards from the top of Pinfold Lane on to the common, where there was a pond. From this point, the track became Hangman's Lane up to the gallows, sited there, it is said, to discourage the poor who would collect their wood and feed their geese on the common. The point is marked today by some fir trees.\n\nThe common originally stretched from Barrowden Lane to Foster's Bridge. The Earl of Ancaster exchanged his fields, on which the allotments and recreation field now stand, for the of common on which he built Luffenham Heath golf course which opened in 1911. In January 1921, fire destroyed the workshop, showroom, and caddy's hut at the Golf Club, having been started by a spark from a stove in the workshop.\n\nAt Christmas 1793, a tribe of gypsies were camping at the 'Follies' near Foster's Bridge. The gypsy king, named Edward Boswell, had a beautiful daughter, Rose, the Princess. She was just 17 and dying of consumption (tuberculosis). When the time came to move on, she was too ill to travel in a jolting caravan, and so the gypsies stayed a further two months on the cold bleak heath. When she died, the churchwardens of South Luffenham would not have her buried in the parish because she was not a Christian. The curate, the Rev. Bateman, finally over-ruled his parishioners and she was buried in the south aisle. A few weeks later, a marble slab arrived from London, and was placed over her remains, subscribed by the many gypsies who converged from afar to express sympathy with their king. The slab is still faintly discernible in the church:\n\n“In memory of Rose Boswell, daughter of Edward and Sarah Boswell, who died February 19th, 1794, aged 17 years. What grief can vent this loss, or praises tell, how much, how good, how beautiful she fell.”\n\nOf other road tracks, Clay Lane leads to the fields below the cemetery, and for those following the main road to Morcott, there used to be a footpath along the north side, but some years ago, the Council widened the road and absorbed the path. On the south side of this road stands a brick barn, this being built in Victorian times to serve as a dance hall for the two villages.\n\nThe village green was once surrounded with white posts and chains, with a seat in the middle. The fence was put up so that the children could play within without being disturbed by wandering cattle. The posts were removed in the 1930s.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Asphaltic Slag & Stone Co. Ltd set up a quarry and erected an office on the Stamford road, opposite the entrance to the recreation ground. Twenty men were employed but not from the village. The quarry business only lasted some four years as the stone was quarried out. Nothing survives as the site has been levelled.\n\nIn 1919, ironstone pits were opened on the road to Pilton; there were extensive sidings to service the pits, which closed in 1968.\n\nAnother quarry opened up at the north-east of the parish and was served by a rail line connecting with the main line near Foster's Bridge. In October 1920, Arthur Waterfield was killed by a fall of earth while engaged at the Luffenham Ironstone Works.\n\nTunnels are said to run from the church to the Foss (the stream), and from the Old Hall site in Tailby's (now Bellamy's) field to the church. One villager recollects in 1912 going down the latter tunnel to rescue a terrier dog. The tunnel was some five feet high, ten feet down and built of rough stone. Having travelled five yards (5 m) in the direction of the Hall he gave up and returned because of the crumbling condition of the tunnel walls.\n\nThere are various theories regarding the mounds in Tailby's field. Some recount that it is the site of the Old Hall and surrounding cottages, others think that the main mound covers an old icehouse. It is true that a few years ago a calf fell into a tunnel beneath the mound, and that afterward this was firmly covered over.\n\nAt the northern corner of this field is the Adam and Eve Barn, so called because of the inset stone carving. It is thought to have been an earlier tithe barn to that which now adjoins the church. Before the Great War, the building, also known as the old Primrose Barn (after the Primrose League used by them prior to 1900) served as the village hall, and dances were held there; here would be danced the 'Lancers' and 'down the middle', all to the accompaniment of an accordion. Later the old school room, opposite the new school, was used for village meetings, until the new village hall was built in September 1922. There was also, at the turn of the 20th century, a reading room and men's club in Sapcote Cottages.\n\nThe 'Old School', now a private cottage, was built in 1846 with pointed windows, to show its connection with the church. This first school was the National School, and it was not until 1875 that the new school opposite was built by the rector, Rev. James Lonsdale and presented to the village. He built it at his own expense and purchased the old school to house the head teacher. In 1900, there were 130 pupils; in 1969, when the school finally closed, there were 30. In 1972, the building was turned into a private house.\n\nThere is no recollection of any bombs falling in the parish during the Second World War, or of aircraft crashes. War touched the community in the form of 28 child evacuees, who in 1940 arrived from London at the height of the bombing of that city. Among them was young Terry Parsons, later to become a famous singer, under the name of Matt Monro.\n\nA pinfold was formerly sited at the south end of Pinfold Lane. It was constructed with a six-foot high stone wall with iron gates, and was finally knocked down in 1910, although a part of the wall still survives today. One villager recollects a farmer walking his sheep from Ayston to Stamford Market and resting them in the pinfold overnight.\n\nThe village did not have a public pond and cattle would drink from the ford on Back Lane, crossing for villagers being by footbridge. There was a pond on private land, where the last bungalow on North Luffenham Road is now sited. A bridge replaced the Back Lane ford in the 1940s.\n\nA lead village pump on the north side of The Square was removed in the 1950s. The well underneath was fed from another well at the corner of Cutting Lane and Gatehouse Lane, the Council paying ten shillings a year to the LNW Railway for a pipe to run underneath the railway. The owner of the top well then demanded ten shillings a year. When the Council refused to pay, the supply was cut off. The Council then sank themselves a well in the Hempyards to supply The Square. The Hempyards, also known as the Ropewalk, survive as mounds today, but nothing is known of the actual works, and it is assumed that they closed in the mid 19th century or earlier.\n\nThe public water supply for the other half of the village came from the spring, still running today, and sited below the old grocer's shop opposite the Boot and Shoe.\n\nCattle were taken to be washed at the wash-dyke set in the Chater, just below the stone bridge on Moor Lane (North Luffenham Road). The wash-dyke was last used in 1925.\n\nThe windmill was built in 1832; in 1895, a storm blew the cap off, but the building continued to be used until 1908.\n\nThe watermill is early 19th century. Owned by Molesworths, a miller was employed, who was responsible for controlling the water level of the sluice and the working of the mill. In addition, his duties covered management of the Railway Hotel. After the closure of the adjoining mill, trade at the hotel decreased and it was forced to close in the 1930s. Prior to 1910, flour had mainly been milled, and sacks were hoisted to the second floor for storage and lowered to carts below when required. When the steam-driven mill was installed in 1910, the mill concentrated on offals; this consisted of split beans, split maize, kibbled wheat (lightly rolled for chickens) and barley meal. Gleaners from the fields took their grist at harvest to the mill to make barley meal for their home-fed pig. Wheat was frailed (flailed) at home with two long poles with leather thongs, this having to take place when there was a high wind, in order that the chaff should blow away. Some gleaners frailed with a five-pronged fork.\n\nThe watermill was sold in 1927. Mr Asplin, the miller, closed the sluice gate one night, forgot about it, and by morning the house and the mill were flooded. He continued milling offal until 1948, when the flume broke, the river taking a different course, and the mill was forced to close.\n\nA steam and electric mill was built by Edmund Stapleton in 1890. The mill machinery was railed direct from Thomas Robinson & Son Ltd of Rochdale via a siding from the Midland Railway. The mill opened in 1892, Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers driving the rollers, and grinding grain at the rate of 8 sacks, each of stone, per hour. Water for the boilers to make steam was pumped from the watermill. Production increased to 10 sacks per hour, then 20. Twelve men were employed from the village, and six from other villages. Men from Molesworths quarry, when short of work, came to the mill, but spent more time in the Railway Inn. In 1914, men earned 14 shillings a week and by 1919, 27 shillings a week. The furthest delivery point by horse and cart was to Somerby, but in the 1920s Foden steam engines took over, these being replaced by Yorkshire cross-boiler engines with solid tyres. By 1925, a Dennis petrol wagon was hired from Leicester. This had pneumatic tyres and speeds of were reached. Flour was then delivered as far away as Coventry and Spalding. Four tons would be carried on the wagon, and four on a trailer.\n\nIn the depression, Cadge & Colman purchased the milling rights, but the mill became uneconomic and the business was transferred to Godmanchester. Luffenham remained a distribution centre until 1927. After remaining empty for some 13 years, Riull & Sons bought the premises and manufactured clips for rifle cartridges.\n\nIn 1942, the Ryvita Company installed a plant for drying and washing rye for biscuit manufacture, up to 20 men being employed at the peak season. The railway siding was in use at the time, but when the station closed in 1966, this link was severed and the factory closed. Newall Engineering then took the premises mainly for reconditioning of grinding machines, some 20 men being employed. The site is now Linecross Limited.\n\nFrom the 14th century until Enclosure in 1882, owners of land held their strips, called 'known acres', each owner or occupier using the same strips each year as his own, subject to rights of grazing. An area of was divided into 1,238 pieces among 22 owners. When the crops had been gathered, the land became common pasture until wanted for the next cultivation. In South Luffenham, only tenants of the arable land had rights of common over the arable, whereas in Barrowden, owners of certain cottages had grazing rights. The ancient custom had been that a fixed or 'stinted' number of beasts used the fields, but of later years this was disregarded.\n\nAs the fog closed in on an elderly woman toiling up the common from Tixover, shrouded against the cold night air, the sound of the church bell tolling guided her back to South Luffenham. In gratitude, and for other who might become lost, she donated a field, whose income should pay the sexton to ring the bells at 5 am and 8 pm daily from the end of October to 25 March. This continued for many years until the outbreak of the Great War. The field was originally at Foster's Bridge, but the endowment was transferred to the Bellringers Field, also known as the Feast Field and Bell Field, opposite The Coach House.\n\n\nVarious businesses have been conducted at the Boot and Shoe Inn, a shoemakers business in the mid 19th century, which ceased around 1900, giving the inn its name. A coal business was also carried on from the inn, and the village bakehouse was on the west corner of the building, Mr Chard being the last baker until the 1950s. Villagers brought joints of meat and batter for Yorkshire puddings here on Sundays, and these were cooked in the bake oven for twopence a time up until 1935. The chamber for the flour for bread-making was sited above the ovens to keep it warm and dry, and bags of flour from Luffenham Mills were hauled up on a wooden ladder.\n\nThe Halfway House inn was so called as it was an ostler house at the midpoint for stages between Stamford and Uppingham. In 1814, the 'Lord Wellington Accommodation Coach' ran from Birmingham via Leicester and through South Luffenham at 10 am daily and connected at Stamford with the 'Lord Welling Coach' for travellers on to Norwich. The 'Leicester Coach' passed through at 3 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from Stamford. The pub was extended and renamed the Coach House in the 1990s.\n\nThe former post office was once two cottages; in the part that was later the shop lived George Hippey, a platelayer. He fell foul of the landlord and one day threw paraffin under the front door, followed by a lighted match.\n\nChildren were trained to dance round the maypole, which was set up in the school playground or on the Green, this celebration ceasing in 1923. The May Queen and her attendants travelled around the village in three or four farm wagons, which were decked up with garlands, all the horses having their martingale brasses highly polished. There was then a free tea for the children in the rectory (or occasionally the Hall) grounds, and the lawns would be lit up with large Chinese lanterns. In the evening there would be dancing in the Adam and Eve barn.\n\nThe ploughboys would go round from door to door on Plough Monday, the second Monday in January collecting wine and cakes – and money, if possible. The blacking of faces and dressing up by the boys, traditional in other villages, is not recollected in South Luffenham. The custom died out in the 1920s.\n\nWassailing was held on each 21 December until 1939. At this, the old ladies of the parish would visit the farmers and gentry to collect a shilling or a quart of tea.\n\n(1st Sunday after 15 August). The Nassington or Collyweston band would arrive to start the Feast Week by marching around the village, and then playing on the Green. During the week, cricket matches against other villages were held on the recreation ground. Fenwicks from Lincolnshire arrived with their swingboats, worked by pulling ropes, and a roundabout pulled round by a piebald pony called Tommy. These, other stalls, and a rifle range shooting at clay pipes, were set up in Bellringers Field, and they stayed for the whole week. It is remembered that Vincent Second, an Italian, came from Stamford with his gaily-painted float loaded with ice cream. Great bouts of singing and dancing took place in the pubs during the week, and most men got drunk, some paralytic, on homemade wine.\n\nAt one time, thirteen trains a day plied between Stamford through South Luffenham and on to Seaton railway station on a double line, although one track was taken up in 1914. A small engine pushed and pulled its single carriage up and down the line. The train was affectionately known as the Wessy, the Push and the Pull, the Puff and Dart, or the Dartzi. The line from Seaton was closed and lifted in 1966.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century Jack Ingram, a well-known steeplejack, visited the village one Saturday, and was asked to grease the weathercock. He brought this down from the church steeple, and promptly refused to put it back unless he was paid a gold sovereign. This was eventually given, but not before a fight had broken out over a disagreement amongst the villages over the 'levy'. Ingram later became a \"milestone inspector\" (a tramp).\n\nThere is a tradition in the village that sea-going boats once came up the Foss to a quay by the old village pond, and were unloaded by monks from a monastery below the church. The stream was thought to be a canal, when the sea came up to Uffington, and was quite deep until the water was backed up and silted in the race to provide power at the watermill. The Chater was said to be six feet deep at the wash-dyke.\n\nIn July 1874, Samuel Hippey, a six-year-old child, playing with lucifer matches beneath a straw stack of Mr Ball, the baker, started a conflagration that spread to two cowsheds. The high wind at the time scattered burning thatch and straw in all directions and in 20 minutes George Tailby and George Pretty's farms were ablaze, as were four cottages, two occupied by William Faulks and Thomas Skillett, and a pub tenanted by George Watson. These were in Pinfold Lane; the position of the inn is unrecorded, although it is known from the 1846 Directory that the pub was the Axe and Saw with Mr Pridmore the licensee. The fire covered some , and eleven straw stacks caught fire as well.\n\nAlthough plenty of water was at hand, the fire had too strong a hold and all that could be done was to douse the buildings nearby to prevent a spread. Apart from a pig and a few fowls, there were no casualties, but damage amounted to £1,327.\n\nFire brigades came from Stamford, Uppingham, and Normanton, arriving too late.\n\nIn April 1913, after the passing of the LNWR football special carrying excursionists to Market Harborough to cheer on Stamford (who lost), fire was noticed in Pridmore's farmyard. There was a high wind and it was assumed that a spark had come from the engine. Properties destroyed included Mr Greenfield's butcher shop, five cottages, two farms and three straw stacks; a quantity of livestock, mainly chickens, was also lost.\n\nThe Stamford engine pumped water from the brook, and the manuals from Uppingham and Normanton gave assistance. Every thatched building was burnt out, although those with slates were saved from serious damage; the Durham Ox sign was burnt down.\n\nLater the Parish Council considered subscribing for the Stamford Fire Brigade, for they had turned out with their steamer although not obliged to. This was in the days before the local authorities took over the fire service.\n"}

{"id": "2186845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186845", "title": "Zayd ibn Harithah", "text": "Zayd ibn Harithah\n\nZayd ibn Harithah (, \"\") (c. 581–629 CE), was an early Muslim, sahabah and adopted son of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.\n\nHe is commonly regarded as the third person to have accepted Islam, after Muhammad's wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid, and Muhammad's cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib. Zayd was a slave in Khadija's household for several years, but Muhammad later freed and legally adopted Zayd as his own son.\n\nZayd was a commander in the early Muslim army and led several early military expeditions during the lifetime of Muhammad. Zayd led his final expedition in September 629 C.E, and set out to raid the Byzantine city of Bosra. However the Muslim army was intercepted by Byzantine forces and Zayd was subsequently killed at the Battle of Mu'tah.\n\nZayd was married to prominent women of Muhammad's household, including his cousin Zaynab bint Jahsh and his loyal servant Barakah (Umm Ayman).\n\nZayd is said to have been ten years younger than Muhammad, suggesting a birth-year of c. 581 A.D. He is also said to have been 55 (lunar) years old at his death in 629, indicating a birthdate of 576.\n\nHe was born into the Udhra branch of the Kalb tribe in the Najd, central Arabia. He claimed a pedigree twelfth in descent from Udhra ibn Zayd al-Lat ibn Rufayda ibn Thawr ibn Kalb ibn Wabara. Zayd's mother, Suda bint Thaalaba, was from the Maan branch of the Tayy tribe.\n\nWhen Zayd was \"a young boy of an age at which he could be a servant\" he accompanied his mother on a visit to her family. While they were staying with the Maan tribe, horsemen from the Qayn tribe raided their tents and kidnapped Zayd. They took him to the market at Ukkaz and sold him as a slave for 400 \"dinars \".\n\nZayd's family searched for him, but without success. A lament is attributed to his father, Harithah ibn Sharahil (BaSharahil):\n<poem>\"I weep for Zayd, not knowing what became of him.\"\n\"Is he alive, is he to be expected, or has Death come over him?\"\n\"By God, I ask yet do not comprehend.\"\n\"Was it the plain or the mountain that brought about your end?\"\n\"I wish that I knew: Will you ever return?\"\n\"In this world only for your coming back I yearn.\"\n\"The sun reminds me of him when it dawns, evoking his memory as the dusk falls.\"\n\"When the winds blow, they stir up memories like dust.\"\n\"O how long my sorrow and fear for him last!\"</poem>\n\nZayd was purchased by a merchant of Mecca, Hakim ibn Hizam, who gave the boy as a present to his aunt, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid. He remained in her possession until the day she married Muhammad, when she gave the slave as a wedding present to her bridegroom. Muhammad became very attached to Zayd, to whom he referred as \"al-Ḥabīb\" ().\n\nSome years later, some members of Zayd's tribe happened to arrive in Mecca on pilgrimage. They encountered Zayd and recognised each other, and he asked them to take a message home. \n<poem>\"Carry a message from me to my people,\"\n\"for I am far away, that close to the House and the places of pilgrimage I stay.\"\n\"Let go of the grief that has deeply saddened you,\"\n\"and do not hasten your camels all over the earth.\"\n\"I live with the best of families, may God be blessed;\"\n\"from father to son, of Ma'ad they are the noblest.\"</poem>\n\nOn receiving this message, Zayd's father and uncle immediately set out for Mecca. They found Muhammad at the Kaaba and promised him any ransom if he would return Zayd to them. Muhammad replied that Zayd should be allowed to choose his fate, but that if he wished to return to his family, Muhammad would release him without accepting any ransom in exchange. They called for Zayd, who easily recognised his father and uncle, but told them that he did not want to leave Muhammad, \"for I have seen something in this man, and I am not the kind of person who would ever choose anyone in preference to him.\" At this, Muhammad took Zayd to the steps of the Kaaba, where legal contracts were agreed and witnessed, and announced to the crowds: \"Witness that Zayd becomes my son, with mutual rights of inheritance.\" On seeing this, Zayd's father and uncle \"were satisfied,\" and they returned home without him.\n\nIn accordance with the Arabic custom of adoption at the time, Zayd was thereafter known as \"Zayd ibn Muhammad\" and was a freedman, regarded socially and legally as Muhammad's son.\n\nAt an unknown date before 610, Zayd accompanied Muhammad to Ta'if, where it was a tradition to sacrifice meat to the idols. Near Baldah on their way back to Mecca, they met Zayd ibn Amr and offered him some of the cooked meat that Zayd was carrying in their bag. Zayd ibn Amr, an outspoken monotheist, replied, \"I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering.\" After this encounter, said Muhammad, \"I never stroked an idol of theirs, nor did I sacrifice to them, until God honoured me with his apostleship.\"\n\nWhen Muhammad reported in 610 that he had received a revelation from the angel Jibril (Gabriel), Zayd was one of the first converts to Islam. While Khadijah was the first Muslim of all in the Ummah of Muhammad, she was closely followed by her neighbour Lubaba bint al-Harith, her four daughters, and the first male converts, Ali, Zayd and Abu Bakr.\n\nIn 622, Zayd joined the other Muslims in the \"Hijrah\" to Medina. Once settled in the new city, Muhammad urged each Muslim to \"take a brother in Religion\" so that each would have an ally in the community. Zayd was paired with Muhammad's uncle Hamza. Hamza accordingly trusted his last testament to Zayd just before his death in 625.\n\nA few months later, Muhammad and Abu Bakr sent Zayd back to Mecca to escort their families to Medina. The return party consisted of Muhammad's wife Sawda, his daughters Umm Kulthum and Fatimah, his servant Abu Rafi, Zayd's wife Baraka and their son Usama, Abu Bakr's wife Umm Rumman, his children Asma, Abdullah and Aisha, and a guide named Abdullah ibn Urayqit, and Abu Bakr's kinsman Talhah also decided to accompany them.\n\nZayd married at least six times.\n\nZayd had three children.\n\nAround 625 Muhammad proposed that his cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh, should marry Zayd. At first she refused on the grounds that she was of the Quraysh. It has been suggested that differences between Zaynab's social status and Zayd's were precisely the reason why Muhammad wanted to arrange the marriage:\nThe Prophet was well aware that it is a person's standing in the eyes of Allah that is important, rather than his or her status in the eyes of the people ... their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their ancestors were, but rather their standing in the sight of Allah, that mattered.\n\nBy contrast, Montgomery Watt points out that Zayd was high in Muhammad's esteem.\nShe can hardly have thought that he was not good enough. She was an ambitious woman, however, and may already have hoped to marry Muhammad, or she may have wanted to marry someone with whom Muhammad did not want his family to be so closely allied.\n\nWhen Muhammad announced a new verse of the Qur'an, ,\nZaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.\n\nThe marriage lasted less than two years.\n\nAccording to the 9th-century historians Ibn Sa'd and al-Tabari, Muhammad paid a visit to Zayd's house. The hairskin curtain that served as Zayd’s front door was blown aside, accidentally revealing Zaynab dressed only in her shift. Zaynab arose to dress herself, advising Muhammad that Zayd was not at home but he was welcome to visit. However, he did not enter. He exclaimed to himself, “Praise be to Allah, who turns hearts around!” and then departed. When Zayd came home, Zaynab told him what had happened. Zayd went to Muhammad, saying: “Prophet, I have heard about your visit. Perhaps you admire Zaynab, so I will divorce her.” Muhammad replied, “No, fear Allah and keep your wife.”\n\nAfter this there was conflict between the couple, and Zaynab shut Zayd out of the bedroom. Zayd divorced Zaynab in December 626.\n\nHowever, this story has been rejected by most Muslim scholars mainly because of its lack of having any chain of narration and its complete absence from any authentic hadith. Some commentators have found it absurd that Muhammad would suddenly become aware of Zaynab's beauty one day after having known her all her life; if her beauty had been the reason for Muhammad to marry her, he would have married her himself in the first place rather than arranging her marriage to Zayd.\n\nAccording to the translator Fishbein:\nZaynab, who was Muhammad's cousin, had been married by Muhammad's arrangement to Muhammad's freed slave Zayd b. Harithah, who lived in Muhammad's household and came to be regarded as his adoptive son - so that he was regularly addressed as Zayd, son of Muhammad. Whether the marriage between Zayd and Zaynab was a \"mesalliance\" from the beginning is speculation, though the account maintains that Zayd was not reluctant to divorce his wife and allow her to marry Muhammad. Muhammad is portrayed as reluctant to proceed with the marriage because of scruples about whether marrying one's adopted son's former wife violated the prohibited degrees of marriage. Arab customary practice recognized kinship relations not based on blood ties: fosterage (having nursed from the same woman) was one such relationship; the question whether adoption fell into this category must have been unclear among Muslims. The marriage did not take place until after a Qur'anic revelation was received, giving permission for believers to marry the divorced wives of their adopted sons. \n\nAfter these events, the traditional Arab form of adoption was no longer recognized in Islam; it was replaced by \"kafala\". Three verses of the Qur'an were written about this. Al-Tabari states that Q33:40 was revealed because \"the Munafiqun made this a topic of their conversation and reviled the Prophet, saying 'Muhammad prohibits [marriage] with the [former] wives of one's own sons, but he married the [former] wife of his son Zayd.'\"\nZayd reverted to being known by his original name of Zayd ibn Harithah and was no longer considered Muhammad's legal son after the revelation of Q33:5:\nIbn Saad indicates that Q33:37 was a specific instruction to Muhammad and Zaynab to marry and that it explains why their marriage was necessary.\nZayd was \"one of the famous archers among the Prophet's Companions.\" He fought at Uhud, Trench and Khaybar, and was present at the expedition to Hudaybiyyah. When Muhammad raided Al-Muraysi, he left Zayd behind as governor in Medina.\n\nZayd commanded seven military expeditions.\n\nAccording to Aisha, \"The Messenger of Allah did not ever send Zayd ibn Haritha in an army without putting him in command of it, even if he stayed after he appointed him.\"\n\nZayd ibn Harithah led his final expedition in September 629 C.E. A Muslim force of 3,000 men set out to raid the Byzantine city of Bosra. However, a Byzantine force of \"100,000 Greeks joined by 100,000 men from Lakhm and Judham and Al-Qayn and Bahra' and Bali\" intercepted them at a village called 'Mu'tah'. Zayd held the standard at the battle, until he was struck down by a spear-thrust and he bled to death. The other two leaders, Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib and `Abd Allāh ibn Rawāḥah, were also killed, and the Muslim army was routed.\n\nOn hearing of Zayd's death, Muhammad went to the family. \"The daughter of Zayd wept before the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah wept until he sobbed. Saad ibn Ubada said, 'Messenger of Allah, what is this?' He answered, 'This is the yearning of the lover for the beloved.'\"\n\n\n"}

The population of the village at the 2001 census was 99. It remained less than 100 at the 2011 census and was counted together with the civil parish of Stretton.\n\nThe Thistleton area has shown evidence of Romano-British occupation including a large temple precinct and a possible small market settlement. To the north of the village there has been extensive mining for ironstone, a stone that has featured very prominently in the building of many churches and other buildings in the area for centuries. It was thought that the mining had obliterated evidence of the former greater extent of the village but much archaeology has survived showing that the original Romano-British settlement extended some at least. Extensive surveys, brought about by the planning of a haulage road to the quarry to pass through the site of the ancient township, revealed features including a well-preserved Roman road and the skeleton of a child buried well away from the cemetery. The archaeology is ongoing as the mining continues.\n\nThe village contains several listed buildings including the Old Rectory and the Church of St Nicholas. Many of the village’s buildings are stone-walled and thatched. Although the church is of medieval origin only the 14th century, three-stage tower, complete with gargoyles, remains. The church has been rebuilt in the late 18th by the Brudenells, and the rector, the Rev.d John Henry Fludyer, 4th Baronet to whose family the elaborate chancel is a memorial. The newer building is fourteenth century in style however the shape of the apse is, unusually, half an octagon externally and a semi-circular shape inside. Most of the internal fittings, including the font and the organ, are relatively modern.\n\nClose by, to the south of the village, lies the RAF Cottesmore airfield established a few years before WWII. The airfield is now the Army's Kendrew Barracks.\n\nOn 28 September 1811 a massive crowd of up to 20,000 watched a prizefight at Thistleton Gap. Tom Cribb fought the American Tom Molineaux in a hotly contested re-match for the heavyweight championship of England. The match was a matter of national pride and the names of both these men were famous throughout the land. The venue was chosen as the three counties of Rutland, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire met there and if the police arrived to halt the illegal fight the boxers and crowd could escape across the county boundary. In the eleventh round Cribb knocked out Molineaux. The original match, a year before, had ended in exhaustion for both men after a gruelling 33 rounds with accusations of cheating. During the intervening period both men had lost weight; Cribb because of extensive training with the famous Captain Barclay and Molineaux due to loss of muscle whilst earning his keep at local prizefighting venues.\n"}

At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and was included together with the parish of Great Casterton.\n\nThe parish essentially stretches along the A1 (Ermine Street) from the Bloody Oaks junction to the Casterton junction. At the far north of the parish, the Warren Plantation is on the north-east side of the A1. To the north-west is Empingham. On the southern edge of Exeter Gorse, it borders Great Casterton. The boundary with Great Casterton to the B1081 junction is one field's width north-east of the A1, running parallel to the carriageways, passing the eastern edge of Tickencote Warren farm.\n\nIt crosses the A1 at the B1081 junction 200 metres west of the A1 bridge where it crosses the Rutland Round, following the hedge to the west side of Ingthorpe where it meets the River Gwash and Tinwell. At Wild's Lodge it meets Empingham. It passes northwards along the eastern edge of Chapel Field Spinney again crossing the Rutland Round. It passes east of Cross Roads Farm then follows the road to Bloody Oaks.\n\nOn the northbound A1, sandwiched against the B1081 access road, is the Bloody Oaks Service Station with an OK Diner and a JET (previously a Texaco forecourt) petrol station. Bloody Oaks is at the next junction northwards. The service station allows access to the B1081 for northbound traffic. Southbound traffic on the A1 cannot be accessed.\n\nThe Rutland Round footpath passes west–east through the parish, and straight through the village, following the B1081 under the A1. National Cycle Route 63 also passes through the village, from Cross Roads Farm, then along the B1081, and onwards to Stamford.\n\nBloody Oaks Quarry is a 1.3 hectare nature reserve and SSSI at the former quarry at OS ref SK 970108, south of Bloody Oaks on the south side of the road from Empingham to Bloody Oaks. The area is also known as Roundstone Hill, and is situated in the former quarry of Upper Lincolnshire oolitic limestone.\n\nIt is thought to be the furthest north in England that chalk milkwort is found. Other species found include Horseshoe Vetch, yellow-wort, Autumn Gentian, and common thyme. There are also Pyramidal and Bee Orchids.\n\nTickencote Marsh is a 3-hectare biological SSSI. The site in the valley of the River Gwash is a base-rich grazing marsh, a habitat which is becoming increasingly rare as a result of drainage and a decline in grazing. Common flora include lesser pond-sedge, marsh horsetail and jointed rush.\n\nThe village is famous for St Peter's Church, Tickencote, which possesses a superb Norman chancel arch and an unusual chancel roof vault. In the arch, five orders of shafts support seven orders of moulded arches with zig zag, billet, beak heads, grotesques, crenellations and all manner of leaves, animals and motifs. The arch has sunk in the last 900 years to give a rather depressed appearance. The church was partly rebuilt in neo-Norman style by Samuel Pepys Cockerell in 1792. From 1909-12 the vicar was the Venerable Lonsdale Ragg, later the Archdeacon of Gibraltar from 1934-45.\n\nJohn Clare, when working as a lime burner, used to drink at the Flowerpot Inn, which is now the private house, Flower Pot Cottage (former Stonecroft). In 1903, William Le Queux wrote \"The Tickencote Treasure\".\n\nThe village was formerly the location of Tickencote Hall, built 1705 and demolished 1950. This was the seat of the Wingfield family who carried out much of the restoration of the church. Maurice Edward Wingfield CMG, son of John Wingfield, later became acting Colonial Secretary of the Colony of the Gambia, and his brother Major John Maurice Wingfield became High Sheriff of Rutland in 1911.\n\nWhen the Stamford Bypass was first built in October 1960, the bypass terminated with a roundabout at Tickencote, with the B1081, and the dual-carriageway continued a half-mile north near Tickencote Park. The roundabout regularly had goods vehicles overturning and shedding their load.\n\nOn 11 August 1971 the section of dual carriageway north of Tickencote to The Fox at South Witham, was opened by Earl Gainsborough, Chairman of Rutland County Council, at the B1081 junction. The section was long, took two years to build by Turriff Construction, and cost £2.3 million.\n\nAnother historical feature of the village is a watermill that went out of use in the mid-1930s. Records show that the original mill was in use in the 4th century AD on the south side of the river, whereas the present mill is on the north side of the river and bears an inscription reading 'Tickencote Mill erected 1731 by John Wingfield'.\n\n"}

The population at the 2001 census was 209, increasing to 234 at the 2011 census.\n\nThe village is just west of the A1 and within walking distance of the town of Stamford in Lincolnshire. The village has a well-used village hall, which provides a venue for parties and community events as well as regular special interest classes. Next door to the village hall is a football pitch which as well as providing a sports area is the venue for village parties. A recent major event on the field was the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 where hundreds of villagers and friends turned out for a sports day, barbeque and concert and the lighting of the jubilee beacon made at Tinwell Forge. Also nearby on Crown Lane is the village pub \"The Crown\" which is currently closed but has plans for refurbishment.\n\nTinwell has a beautiful church - All Saints' Church. The church has a distinctive tower with an unusual saddleback roof; these are rare in England and was added in about 1350. Opposite the church is The Old Rectory, birthplace of Thomas Laxton (1830-1893) who conducted plant-breeding research for Charles Darwin and developed the Laxton Superb and Laxton Fortune apples and the Royal Sovereign strawberry.\n\nOther buildings of interest are Tinwell Forge and Bakery which are located on Main Street and were built in 1848. At the front of the forge is a stone surround to the village spring, which was built for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria; there is also a Victorian post box. The bakery closed in 1948 but the forge continues to be in operation. By the riverside is Tinwell Mill, although it is now a private house a mill stood at the same site during the Domesday period.\n\nWalks can be taken from Tinwell south towards Easton on the Hill, with its Norman church and the Priest's House; west around the limestone quarry and along the rivers Chater and Welland towards Ketton, Aldgate and Geeston; and east following the Jurassic Way towards Stamford, and the Macmillan and Hereward Ways to Wothorpe and Burghley House. There is a footpath map showing these routes in the churchyard.\n\nOn 8 July 1944, two C47s collided after taking-off from RAF Spanhoe for an exercise. One crew member managed to parachute safely but eight others and 26 Polish paratroops of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade perished in the crash. The American casualties from 315th Troop Carrier Group were taken to the Cambridge American Cemetery for burial and the Polish casualties were taken to the Polish Cemetery at Newark. All those killed are commemorated in the church.\n\nThe village is associated with the site of the lost or shrunken medieval village of Ingthorpe, in the north of the parish, close to the River Gwash.\n"}

Its beach is part of Port Dickson's long coastline fronting the Strait of Malacca.\n\nThere is a holiday resort, Glory Beach Resort, built approximately 5 years ago in Tanjung Gemuk. It is not a luxurious resort but an economic accommodation option which attracts many tourists from all over the country and even from countries around Malaysia because of its low price, good service and fairly good facilities. Recently, many water chalets have been built in Tanjung Gemuk. One of them is Grand Lexis (formerly known as The Legend International Water Homes), which not only provide water chalets but normal rooms with good facilities. Tanjung Gemuk is still a fairly big residential area despite the hotel and the resort. There are also some coffee shops and grocery shops where residents and tourists always visit.\n\nTurtles have been sighted laying eggs on its beach recently. Locals have seen baby turtles reaching out from the sand heading towards the water. This is a new phenomenon in Tanjung Gemuk. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, sea cucumbers were washed up the beach in Tanjung Gemuk; thousands were seen but most of them were dead. Surprised locals combed the beach for the sea cucumbers because they are considered a delicacy.\n"}

{"id": "2186918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186918", "title": "Kainate receptor", "text": "Kainate receptor\n\nKainate receptors, or kainic acid receptors (KARs), are ionotropic receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter glutamate. They were first identified as a distinct receptor type through their selective activation by the agonist kainate, a drug first isolated from the red alga \"Digenea simplex\". They have been traditionally classified as a non-NMDA-type receptor, along with the AMPA receptor. KARs are less understood than AMPA and NMDA receptors, the other ionotropic glutamate receptors. Postsynaptic kainate receptors are involved in excitatory neurotransmission. Presynaptic kainate receptors have been implicated in inhibitory neurotransmission by modulating release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA through a presynaptic mechanism.\n\nThere are five types of kainate receptor subunits, GluR (), GluR (), GluR (), KA1 () and KA2 (), which are similar to AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and can be arranged in different ways to form a tetramer, a four subunit receptor. GluR can form homomers (ex. a receptor composed entirely of GluR5) and heteromers (ex. a receptor composed of both GluR and GluR), however, KA1 and KA2 can only form functional receptors by combining with one of the GluR subunits. Since 2009 the kainate receptor subunits have been renamed to correspond with their gene name. Hence GluR5-7 are now GluK1-3 and KA1 and KA2 are GluK4 and GluK5 respectively.\n\nEach KAR subunit begins with a 400-residue extracellular N-terminal domain, which plays a key role in assembly, followed by the first segment of the neurotransmitter-binding cleft, called S1. This segment then passes through the cell membrane, forming the first of three membrane-spanning regions, M1. The M2 segment then begins on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, pushes into the cell membrane about half way, and then dips back out to the cytoplasm. This segment, termed the \"p loop,\" determines the calcium permeability of the receptor. M2 turns into M3, another transmembrane segment which emerges on the extracellular face to complete the neurotransmitter binding site (a portion called S2). M4 begins extracellularly, and passes again through the membrane into the cytoplasm, forming the C-terminal of the protein.\n\nThe ion channel formed by kainate receptors is permeable to sodium and potassium ions. The single channel conductance of kainate receptor channels is similar to that of AMPA channels, at about 20 pS. However, rise and decay times for postsynaptic potentials generated by KARs are slower than for AMPA postsynaptic potentials. Their permeability to Ca is usually very slight but varies with subunits and RNA editing at the tip of the p loop.\nKainate receptors have both presynaptic and postsynaptic actions. They have a somewhat more limited distribution in the brain than AMPA and NMDA receptors, and their function is less well defined. The convulsant kainic acid induces seizures, in part, by activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK2 subunit and also probably via AMPA receptors Activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK1 subunit can also induce seizures but deletion of this subunit does not reduce seizure susceptibility to kainate or in other seizure models. Deletion of either GluK1 or GluK2 does not alter kindling epileptogenesis or the expression of kindled seizures.\n\nRecent investigation through voltage clamping has shown that kainate receptors have more than just an ionotropic (or directly changing a membrane's conductivity) role in neurons. The metabotropic (or indirect through secondary protein pathways) effect has been verified through many accessory proteins and sustained current through G-protein cascades. The specific link of this pathway remains to be found, as well as the explanation for why the polarization and distribution of KARs varies so much across neurons and brain regions. The proteins have been shown to pace the receptors and help explain KAR’s role in maturation of neural circuits during development.\n\nOne of the larger connections and roles that kainate receptors have been shown to have is to several neurological diseases and conditions. KAR expression and distribution has shown a linkage to schizophrenia, depression, autism, Huntington’s, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy among others. Most come through mutations of GluK1-5. The causation is unclear and the subject of further investigation.\n\nUnlike AMPA receptors, kainate receptors play only a minor role in signaling at synapses. Kainate receptors have a subtle role in synaptic plasticity, affecting the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell will fire in response to future stimulation. Activating kainate receptors in the presynaptic cell can affect the amount of neurotransmitters that are released This effect may occur quickly and last for a long time, and the effects of repetitive stimulation of KARs can be additive over time.\n\n\n\n"}

As a student, he trained in history, political science, economics, and art at the universities of Göttingen, Leipzig, and Munich. Lamprecht taught at the university in Marburg and later at Leipzig, where he founded a center dedicated to comparative world and cultural history (Institut für Kultur- und Universalgeschichte).\n\nLamprecht was employee at the successful edition project “The Chronicles of the German Cities” under the leadership of the well-known and highly reputated German historian Karl von Hegel.\n\nLamprecht studied German and European social and economic history, particularly of the Middle Ages. He aroused considerable controversy with his loose interdisciplinary methods and focus on broad social, environmental, and even psychological, questions in history. To him, history meant as much the revelation of sociology as of political events.\n\nLamprecht's ambitious \"Deutsche Geschichte\" (13 vols., 1891-1908) on the whole trajectory of German history sparked a famous \"Methodenstreit\" (methodological dispute) within Germany's academic history establishment, especially Max Weber, who habitually referred to Lamprecht as a mere dilettante. Lamprecht came under criticism from scholars of legal and constitutional history like Friedrich Meinecke and Georg von Below for his lack of methodological rigor and inattention to important political trends and ideologies. As a result, Lamprecht and his students were marginalized by German academia, and interdisciplinary social history remained something of a taboo among German historians for much of the twentieth century. However, during the years of the series' publication, his work enjoyed a wide readership among the nonacademic German community.\n\nHe was the chief exponent of the \"Kulturgeschichte\" (“History of Culture”), and believed intensely in the superiority of German culture. Shortly before his death he repudiated, with some indignation, the conception of Germany's part in World War I as having been dictated by “war lords,” and avowed that in regard to it that Germany was united.\n\nLamprecht died in Leipzig on 10 May 1915 from what appears to have been the result of internal bleeding brought on by a perforated ulcer.\n\nAccording to Ernst Breisach,\n\nLamprecht found a much more positive reception for his ideas and methods in France and the United States. In 1904, he was invited to give a series of lectures at Columbia University, which were translated and published in 1905 as \"What is History?\"\n\nLamprecht's work was a formative influence in the thinking of the French social historian Marc Bloch as well the Annales School. One of his students was Cai Yuanpei, who later served as the chancellor of Beijing University and had an enormous influence on modern Chinese thought.\n\n\n"}

The bend or deformity is called the crimp.\n\nThe metals are joined together via a special connector. Stripped wire (often stranded) is inserted through the correctly sized opening of the connector, and a crimper is used to tightly squeeze the opening against the wire. Depending on the type of connector used, it may be attached to a metal plate by a separate screw or bolt or it could be simply screwed on using the connector itself to make the attachment like an F connector.\n\nCrimping is most extensively used in metalworking. Crimping is commonly used to fix bullets in their cartridge cases, for rapid but lasting electrical connections, securing lids on metal food cans, and many other applications. Because it can be a cold-working technique, crimping can also be used to form a strong bond between the workpiece and a non-metallic component. \n\nWhen joining segments of tubular sheet metal pipe, such as for smoke pipes for wood stoves, downspouts for rain gutters, or for installation of ventilation ducting, one end of a tube is treated with a crimping tool to make a slip joint into the next section of duct. The joint will not be liquid-tight but will be adequate for conveying low pressure fluids. Crimp joints may be arranged to prevent accumulation of dirt.\n\nIn jewelry manufacture, crimp beads, or crimp tubes, are used to make secure joints in fine wire, such as used in clasps or tie loops. A crimped lead (or other soft metal) seal is attached to secure wires used to secure fasteners in aircraft, or to provide visual evidence of tampering when securing a utility meter or as a seal on cargo containers. \n\n"}

His African-American father, an airman stationed at Clark Air Base, left the family shortly after his birth; his Filipino mother, Cristina Pineda, raised him and his six younger siblings as a single mother. As a child, Pineda would make an hour-long jeepney trip to and from his school and helped his family subsist by farming sweet potatoes, corn, sugar cane, and rice. The Pearl S. Buck Foundation, an organization that finds healthier living environments for young abandoned or orphaned American children, matched him with a sponsor named Joe Ben Hudgens, a lawyer, through a dollar-a-day program.\n\nHe initially came to the United States at the age of 14 for treatment for nystagmus, an involuntary movement of the eyes. After a trip to Disneyland, Pineda expressed his interest in staying in the United States. It would take another three years for Hudgens to officially adopt him, but at fourteen he moved permanently to the United States to live with Hudgens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Pineda attended John Marshall High School, where he met and befriended William Adams (stage name will.i.am), the nephew of Hudgens' roommate. Pineda's early musical influences were Stevie Wonder, The Eagles, The Beatles, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Leaders of the New School and the Filipino rock/folk group Asin. Pineda was introduced to hip hop by break dancing. \"I would take the jeepney all the way to Angeles City, and that's how I got introduced to break dancing,\" he said. \"I would see kids at the corner break-dancing and I'm like, 'I wanna do that.'\" Pineda revealed to \"People Magazine\" in 2011 that he is legally blind in both of his eyes, suffering from nystagmus and has had this condition his entire career. His vision was corrected in 2012.\n\nHe has lost two of his siblings: his younger brother Arnel committed suicide (this is referenced in \"The Apl Song\" in the lines \"I guess sometimes life's stresses get you down on your knees/Oh brother, wish I could have helped you out\"). His youngest brother, Joven Pineda Deala, was murdered at the age of 22 in February 2009 in Porac, Pampanga.\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders will.i.am and apl.de.ap met and began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E manager Jerry Heller's nephew. Along with another friend of theirs, Dante Santiago, they called their trio Atban Klann (ATBAN: A Tribe Beyond a Nation). Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker) and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their debut album, \"Grass Roots\", was never released because Ruthless founder Eazy-E had died.\n\nAfter Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas. Dante Santiago was replaced with Taboo, and Kim Hill became a steady background singer. Unlike many hip hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the gangsta rap sounds of Los Angeles-based hip hop acts at the time. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, \"Behind the Front\" (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \"Joints & Jam\", and was featured on the \"Bulworth\" soundtrack. Their second album was \"Bridging the Gap\" (2000), which included the single \"Request + Line\" featuring Macy Gray.\n\nIn November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, \"Elephunk\". Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo were to feature on the album. During the production of \"Shut Up\" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with Eden's Crush. Danté Santiago then introduced Fergie to Will who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. In the United States, \"Elephunk\" reached number 14 on the \"Billboard Top 200\" and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success in the UK Album Charts where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK and 8.5 million copies worldwide. The singles \"Where Is the Love?\" and \"Shut Up\" reached number 1. \"Hey Mama\" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for Apple and iTunes. \"Let's Get It Started\" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film \"Hot Tub Time Machine\". After the success of \"Elephunk\", the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game \"\". They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into Simlish and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters.\n\nThe group released their breakthrough single, \"Where Is the Love?\", in November 2002 (featuring Justin Timberlake, although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like \"Shut Up\", \"Elephunk\" went on to sell 8.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nIn November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled \"Monkey Business\", the second album with new band member Fergie. Upon the success of \"Monkey Business\", which was released in 2005, the album was certified three times Platinum by the RIAA in the U.S. and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The Canadian Recording Industry Association (or CRIA) has certified \"Monkey Business\" 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The Australian Recording Industry Association (or ARIA) has also certified \"Monkey Business\" 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 Grammy Award nominations and they also won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". According to IFPI, over 2 million copies have been sold in Europe. In the UK alone, it has sold over 1 million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of \"Elephunk\", which stand at over 1.6 million copies and 10 million worldwide. The band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects.\n\nIn early 2009, both Fergie and the group left A&M Records for unknown reasons, both Fergie and the group are still with Interscope Records.\n\nThe group's fifth studio album, \"The E.N.D.\" (\"The \"E\"nergy \"N\"ever \"D\"ies\"), was released on June 9, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip hop/R&B feeling of their previous albums. Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' \"My People\". \"The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People – that shit is wild,\" will.i.am said, \"That's the reason why this record sounds the way it does – my three months in Australia.\" In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In the United States, the album became the ninth album to top the one million mark in sales in 2009. The album spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the \"Billboard\" 200. \"The E.N.D.\" was the 7th best-selling album of 2009 in the U.S. It also debuted at number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand and three in the United Kingdom. Three additional singles, \"Imma Be\", \"Alive\", and \"Meet Me Halfway\", were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album's release.\n\nIn 2009, the group became one of only artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", with the next single \"Meet Me Halfway\" achieving similar success, from the album \"The E.N.D.\". These three singles topped the chart for 30 consecutive weeks in 2009. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on the \"Billboard\"s Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. In November 2010, they released the album \"The Beginning\". The first single of the album was \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\" and topped the charts in many countries. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. The album's second single was \"Just Can't Get Enough\" and was released in February 2011. The music video was filmed in Japan one week before the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The third single \"Don't Stop the Party\" was released in May 2011. In July 2011 the group announced that they are taking a break and have denied breakup rumors. On October 11, launched his new advocacy campaign with a song called \"We Can Be Anything\" for education, encouraging children in the Philippines and around the world to stay in school. He also teamed up with the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF), 57-75 Movement, and the Department of Education. Apl.d.ap and NCAF plan to build 10,000 classrooms in two years or less through the advocacy. His bandmates helped set the campaign grand launch at the Black Eyed Peas concert on October 25 at the SM Mall of Asia concert grounds. On November 29, Apl.de.ap performed the campaign song with will.i.am at the Mnet Asian Music Awards held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nOn May 19, 2012, Apl.de.ap attended the We Can Be Anything Campaign Charity Gala Dinner at The Westbury Hotel in London. On October 13, Apl.de.ap teamed up with Smart Communications to release a music video called \"Jump In\" featuring \"American Idol\" Season 11 runner-up Jessica Sanchez. In March 2013, Apl.de.ap was confirmed to be one of the four coaches of the inaugural season of \"The Voice of the Philippines\". On September 22, Apl premiered his new single \"Balikbayan\" on \"The Voice of the Philippines\". He performed the song alongside the Top 8 contestants and Miss Universe 2010 fourth runner-up Venus Raj during the results night of the semi-finals. On September 27, he released the digital single, \"Going Out\". He also revealed that \"Balikbayan\" will be released on December. On January 31 Apl.de.ap revealed his newest single and its accompanying music video, 'Be', featuring Honey Cocaine and Jessica Reynoso.\n\nHe also appeared as a guest mentor for Will.i.am on the third series of \"The Voice Australia\". On June 12, 2014, he confirmed his return for the second season of \"The Voice of The Philippines\".\n\nApl.de.ap collaborated with Filipino composer Ryan Cayabyab for his performance in the opening ceremony of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines. He and the rest of The Black Eyed Peas also performed in the closing ceremony.\n\nApl.de.ap was honored in America by the prestigious This Time Foundation for his charity works. On November 18, 2008, he founded the Apl Foundation to help various communities and children in the Philippines and throughout Asia. In 2011, after expressing his desire to help improve the education situation in the Philippines, his foundation formed a partnership with the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF) to create the \"We Can Be Anything\" advocacy campaign where Apl.de.ap and NCAF plan to build 10,000 classrooms in two years or less through the advocacy.\n\nDuring an interview made by \"The Huffington Post\" on 2012, he stated that he has plans on launching his own talent show in the Philippines. \"I've been working myself up to do it because I'm not used to being on TV everyday... I've been offered a show for next year,\" he revealed. This eventually fueled rumors that he would be joining the panel of the show after ABS-CBN acquired the rights to launch a local version of \"The Voice\" franchise later that year.\n\nIn March 1, 2013, ABS-CBN has confirmed that they are in the final stages of negotiating with his management to become its fourth and last official coach of the show. On March 7, it was announced through ABS-CBN's entertainment website, Push, that Apl will sit as the fourth coach. On March 20, the network's official website stated that he was scheduled to do the initial promotional plug with TFC London and is scheduled to arrive in Manila by April to meet and work with the three other coaches and the rest of the show's team. His promotional television plug was aired on March 27 right after \"TV Patrol\". During his introduction as the fourth coach, he was dubbed as \"\"The voice that ruled the worldwide music chart\".\"\n\nIn an interview conducted by ABS-CBN News, Apl admitted that it was will.i.am, Pineda's friend and co-member in The Black Eyed Peas, that encouraged him to accept the coaching stint in \"The Voice of the Philippines\". Will.i.am is also a coach on \"The Voice UK\". He also told the press that he will be truthful on coaching his artists, as well giving them constructive criticisms. He also wants to share his life experiences, what he has been through the music industry, and how hard it is to fulfill and reach it.\n\nHe also became a judge in The Voice Teens.\n\nIn 2014, he opened his independent record label, BMBX Entertainment, whose name refers to 'boombox'. The label aims to sign South East Asian artists and give them a Western-style production by collaborating with musicians in Los Angeles. The label sources its talent from the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. Its current roster includes Slapshock, Kevin Lester and \"The Voice Philippines\" season 1 semi-finalist Jessica Reynoso.\n\nBeginning with season 2, he will be hosting Top Gear Philippines, replacing Gary Valenciano. He will host along with Marlon Stockinger, Richard Gomez (Season 1-3), and Jolina Magdangal (Season 4 onwards).\n\nDuring an interview with \"ABC News\", apl.de.ap said that he was born with a condition called nystagmus, which is characterized by an involuntary movement of the eyes that limits vision. The interview showed apl.de.ap undergoing an eye surgery by Beverly Hills eye surgeon Brian Boxer Wachler to implant artificial lenses into his eyes to correct nearsightedness and his nystagmus.\n\nPineda is a native speaker of two Philippine languages: Tagalog and Kapampangan.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2186955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186955", "title": "McDonnell XP-67", "text": "McDonnell XP-67\n\nThe McDonnell XP-67 \"Bat\" or \"Moonbat\" was a prototype for a twin-engine, long-range, single-seat interceptor aircraft for the United States Army Air Forces. Although the design was conceptually advanced, it was beset by numerous problems and never approached its anticipated level of performance. The project was cancelled after the sole completed prototype was destroyed by an engine fire.\n\nIn 1940, the U.S. Army Air Corps issued Request for Proposal R-40C, requesting designs for a high-speed, long-range, high-altitude interceptor intended to destroy enemy bombers. The specifications were very bold, encouraging manufacturers to produce radical aircraft that would outperform any existing fighter in the world at the time. The aerospace parts manufacturer McDonnell Aircraft, eager to begin manufacturing its own aircraft, responded to the proposal with drawings and specifications of the proposed \"Model I\", which would be powered by an unusual geared drivetrain with a single Allison V-3420 engine buried in the fuselage powering twin wing-mounted pusher propellers in the wings. However, 22 other manufacturers also issued proposals to meet the Army's request; the McDonnell proposal had relatively unimpressive anticipated performance, and its odd drivetrain was unproven. The Model I fell in 21st place when the 23 proposals were examined and scored. The proposals that were accepted included the similarly ill-fated XP-54, XP-55, and XP-56. Despite the apparent setback, Air Corps leaders were impressed by the nascent company's efforts, and granted McDonnell a $3,000 contract to re-engineer the aircraft.\n\nMcDonnell engineers returned on 30 June 1940 with the \"Model II\", which was also rejected, so it was reworked into the \"Model IIa\", which emerged on 24 April 1941. The new design was powered by a more traditional layout, a pair of engines in wing-mounted nacelles with four-bladed propellers in a tractor configuration. However, the design was still quite ambitious; the design team tried to maintain a true airfoil section through the center fuselage, merge the rear portions of the engine nacelles with the wing, and radically fillet all edges of the fuselage and nacelles into the wings in an effort to reduce drag. The design used laminar airfoil sections throughout. McDonnell designers promised that the design would deliver a top speed of 472 mph (760 km/h) with a gross weight of 18,600 lb (8,440 kg), although the anticipated gross weight was soon increased to a somewhat more realistic 20,000 lb (9,070 kg).\n\nOn 30 September 1941, the USAAF granted McDonnell a $1,508,596 contract, plus an $86,315 fee, for two prototypes, a wind tunnel model, and associated engineering data. The Model IIa was designated as the \"XP-67\". The production aircraft was intended to have a pressurized cockpit, an innovation at the time. A number of armament configurations were considered including six .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon, and even a 75 mm (2.95 in) cannon before the configuration of six 37 mm (1.46 in) M4 cannon was chosen. Power would be provided by two Continental XIV-1430-1 inverted V-12 engines, fitted with turbosuperchargers, and the engine exhaust gases would augment thrust.\n\nAn extensive aerodynamic test program of the numerous advanced aspects of the design was begun by McDonnell, NACA, and the University of Detroit. The design demanded skin that was perfectly smooth and precisely shaped to maintain its laminar-flow characteristics, mandating the development of new construction techniques, as the company had never produced an entire aircraft before. Wind tunnel testing uncovered problems with engine cooling airflow through the engine nacelles, which were never fully resolved. Difficulties were also encountered in obtaining engines, as wartime production demands hampered Continental's efforts to deliver running examples of the experimental XIV-1430 engines to competing aircraft test programs. The project was also delayed by intense competition for testing time at the NACA wind tunnel facility in Langley, Virginia.\n\nThe first XP-67, \"42-11677\", was ready for ground trials on 1 December 1943. The aircraft was fitted with XIV-1430-17/19 engines and General Electric D-23 turbo-superchargers but no pressurization equipment or armament was installed. On 8 December, the aircraft was damaged by fires in both engine nacelles, caused by a malfunction of the exhaust manifold slip rings. By 6 January 1944, the damage was repaired and the XP-67 made its first flight, which ended after six minutes due to engine trouble. After modifications were made to the engine installations, two test flights were carried out. On the fourth flight, the engine bearings burned out when the engines were accidentally overspeeded.\nBy this time, it was becoming obvious that the XP-67 was hampered by a serious lack of power. The engines were only delivering 1,060 hp (790 kW), well short of their promised 1,350 hp (1,007 kW) rating. Company founder Jim McDonnell, frustrated by engine procurement delays and the XI-1430's subpar output, began to campaign for funding to re-engine the prototype with a pair of Allison or Rolls Royce piston engines augmented by auxiliary Westinghouse turbojets in the aft nacelles. Although McDonnell promised a very impressive 500 mph (805 km/h) top speed with the new powerplants, the Army rejected the proposal, demanding more testing of the existing design. As a result of wind tunnel tests, the tailplanes were raised 12 in (31 cm) while the XP-67 waited for replacement engines.\n\nOn 23 March 1944, flight trials restarted. U.S. Army Air Forces pilots finally got to fly the aircraft on 11 May 1944, and judged the cockpit layout fair and ground handling satisfactory, but deemed the aircraft underpowered due to its poor initial rate of climb, slow acceleration, and long takeoff roll, particularly when operating with only one engine. Other flight characteristics were generally good during gentle maneuvers; stick forces were light, roll rate was adequate, and control was effective at all speeds with good longitudinal stability. However, a tendency to \"dutch roll\" was prevalent. The prototype also displayed several disturbing behaviors as its stall speed was approached. It began to buffet well above the actual stall speed, it felt tail-heavy in fast turns, and its nose would tuck upwards during the stall. The problems were serious enough that test pilots declined to test the XP-67's spin characteristics, fearing that a spin might be unrecoverable. This irregular and unstable stall behavior has been attributed to advanced aerodynamic principles that were not fully counteracted until the advent of electronic stability controls years later. Although the final flight test report was generally positive, the aircraft's maneuverability was deemed inferior to existing types such as the North American P-51 Mustang.\n\nUpon return to the factory, the cooling ducts were reworked. Several problems were cured during the ensuing test flights, but the engines continued to be plagued by chronic overheating and deficient power output. The XP-67 only reached a confirmed top speed of 405 mph (652 km/h), which was far short of its promised top speed of 472 mph (760 km/h), and was unremarkable compared to other fighters in service at the time.\n\nOn 6 September 1944, the starboard engine of the XP-67 caught fire during a test flight, and test pilot E.E. Elliot executed an emergency landing at Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri. He attempted to park the craft pointing into the wind to blow the flames away from the airframe, but the starboard main landing gear brakes failed, pivoting the XP-67 so the flames blew directly towards the aft fuselage. Elliot escaped safely, but the blaze gutted the fuselage, engine, nacelle, and starboard wing; the aircraft was a total loss.\n\nThe destruction of the lone flying prototype dealt a serious blow to the entire program because the second prototype was only 15% complete at the time. Army leaders decided to reevaluate the XP-67, ultimately deciding on 13 September that it offered no significant advantages over existing fighters already in service. The project was canceled, the remains of the first prototype scrapped, and work halted on the second prototype.\n\n"}

Before the renaming in January 2020, the website's name was Spiegel Online (short form: SPON).\n\nIt was founded in 1994 as the online offshoot of the German news magazine, \"Der Spiegel\", with a staff of journalists working independently of the magazine. Today, it is the most frequently quoted online media product in Germany. \"Spiegel Online International\", a section featuring articles translated into English, was launched in autumn 2004. In 2019, its editorial office was merged with the one of the printed Spiegel and in 2020, the website was renamed accordingly.\n\nThe news website \"Der Spiegel\" is run by \"Der Spiegel GmbH & Co.

The editorial offices of the news website and the print magazine \"Der Spiegel\" are separate operations, that had their own offices, authors, and content until January 2020. Now, content for both media is created by a shared editorial team. The news portal \"Der Spiegel\" has a record of profitability. Regular staff includes 150 people in the Hamburg headquarters, complemented by freelancers, and domestic and international news bureaus. In the German capital, Berlin, 15 correspondents cover the German federal government, political parties, corporations and artists. The Munich and Düsseldorf offices have one correspondent each. There are journalists based in Washington, D.C., New York, London, Moscow, New Delhi and Istanbul.

{"id": "2186972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186972", "title": "Toronto Police Service", "text": "Toronto Police Service\n\nThe Toronto Police Service (TPS) is a municipal police force in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the primary agency responsible for providing law enforcement and policing services in Toronto. Established in 1834, it was the first local police service created in North America and is one of the oldest police services in the English-speaking world. \n\nIt is the largest municipal police service in Canada, and third largest police force in Canada after the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). With a 2020 budget of $1.076 billion, the Toronto Police Service ranks as the second largest expense – after the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) – of the City of Toronto's annual operating budget.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service was founded in 1834, when the city of Toronto was first created from the town of York. Prior to that, local able-bodied male citizens were required to report for night duty as special constables for a fixed number of nights per year on pain of fine or imprisonment, in a system known as \"watch and ward\". \n\nThe Toronto Police is one of the English-speaking world's oldest modern municipal police departments; it is older than, for example, the New York City Police Department, which was formed in 1845, or the Boston Police Department, which was established in 1839. The London Metropolitan Police of 1829 is generally recognized as the first modern municipal police department. In 1835, Toronto retained five full-time constables—a ratio of about one officer for every 1,850 citizens. Their daily pay was set at 5 shillings for day duty and 7 shillings, 6 pence, for night duty. In 1837, the constables’ annual pay was fixed at £75 per annum, a lucrative city position when compared to the mayor's annual pay of £250 at the time.\n\nFrom 1834 to 1859, the Toronto Police was a corrupt and notoriously political force, with its constables loyal to the local aldermen who personally appointed police officers in their own wards for the duration of their incumbency. Toronto constables on numerous occasions suppressed opposition candidate meetings and took sides during bitter sectarian violence between Orange Order and Irish Catholic radical factions in the city. A provincial government report in 1841 described the Toronto Police as \"formidable engines of oppression\". Although constables were issued uniforms in 1837, one contemporary recalled that the Toronto Police was \"without uniformity, except in one respect—they were uniformly slovenly.\" After an excessive outbreak of street violence involving Toronto Police misconduct, including an episode where constables brawled with Toronto's firemen in one incident, and stood by doing nothing in another incident while enraged firemen burned down a visiting circus when its clowns jumped a lineup at a local brothel, the entire Toronto Police force, along with its chief, were fired in 1859.\n\nThe new force was removed from Toronto city council jurisdiction (except for the setting of the annual budget and manpower levels) and placed under the control of a provincially mandated board of police commissioners. Under its new chief, William Stratton Prince, a former infantry captain, standardized training, hiring practices and new strict rules of discipline and professional conduct were introduced. Today's Toronto Police Service directly traces its ethos, constitutional lineage and Police Commission regulatory structure to the 1859 reforms.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Toronto Police mostly focused on the suppression of rebellion in the city—particularly during the Fenian threats of 1860 to 1870. The Toronto Police were probably Canada's first security intelligence agency when they established a network of spies and informants throughout Canada West in 1864 to combat US Army recruiting agents attempting to induce British Army soldiers stationed in Canada to desert to serve in the Union Army in the Civil War. The Toronto Police operatives later turned to spying on the activities of the Fenians and filed reports to the Chief Constable from as far as Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago and New York City. When in December 1864, the Canada West secret frontier police was established under Stipendiary Magistrate Gilbert McMicken, some of the Toronto Police agents were reassigned to this new agency.\n\nIn 1863, Toronto police officers were also used as \"Indian fighters\" during the Manitoulin Island Incident, when some fifty natives armed with knives forced the fishery inspector William Gibbard and a fishery operation to withdraw from unceded tribal lands on Lake Huron. Thirteen armed Toronto police officers, along with constables from Barrie, were dispatched to Manitoulin Island to assist the government in retaking the fishery operation, but were forced back when the natives advanced now armed with rifles. The police withdrew but were later reinforced and eventually arrested the entire band, but not before William Gibbard was killed by unknown parties.\n\nIn the 1870s, as the Fenian threat began to gradually wane and the Victorian moral reform movement gained momentum, Toronto police primarily functioned in the role of \"urban missionaries\" whose function it was to regulate unruly and immoral behaviour among the \"lower classes\". They were almost entirely focused on arresting drunks, prostitutes, disorderlies, and violators of Toronto's ultra-strict Sunday \"blue law\"\n\nIn the days before public social services, the force functioned as a social services mega-agency. Prior the creation of the Toronto Humane Society in 1887 and the Children's Aid Society in 1891, the police oversaw animal and child welfare, including the enforcement of child support payments. They operated the city's ambulance service and acted as the board of health. Police stations at the time were designed with space for the housing of homeless, as no other public agency in Toronto dealt with this problem. Shortly before the Great Depression, in 1925, the Toronto Police housed 16,500 homeless people.\n\nThe Toronto Police regulated street-level business: cab drivers, street vendors, corner grocers, tradesmen, rag men, junk dealers, and laundry operators. Under public order provisions, the Toronto Police was responsible for the licensing and regulation of dance halls, pool halls, theatres, and later movie houses. It was responsible for censoring the content of not only theatrical performances and movies, but of all literature in the city ranging from books and magazines to posters and advertising.\n\nThe Toronto Police also suppressed labour movements which were perceived as anarchist threats. The establishment of the mounted unit is directly related to the four-month Toronto streetcar strike of 1886, when authorities called on the Governor General's Horse Guard Regiment to assist in suppressing the strike.\n\nAs for serious criminal investigations, the Toronto Police frequently (but not always) contracted with private investigators from the Pinkerton's Detective Agency until the 20th century, when it developed its own internal investigation and intelligence capacity.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, the Toronto Police under Chief Constable Dennis \"Deny\" Draper, a retired brigadier general and former Conservative candidate, returned to its function as an agency to suppress political dissent. Its notorious \"Red Squad\" brutally dispersed demonstrations by labour unions and by unemployed and homeless people during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Suspicious of \"foreigners\", the police lobbied the city of Toronto to pass legislation banning public speeches in languages other than English, curtailing union organization among Toronto's vast immigrant populations working in sweat shops.\n\nAfter several scandals, including a call by Chief Draper to have reporters \"shot\" and his being arrested driving drunk, the city appointed in 1948 a new police chief from its own ranks for the first time in the department's history: John Chisholm, a very able senior police inspector. In 1955, the Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners was formed in preparation for the amalgamation of the 13 police forces in the municipality, Metropolitan Toronto, into a unified police force with Chisholm as chief of the unified force. Unfortunately, Chisholm was not up to the politics of the Chief's office, especially in facing off with Fred \"Big Daddy\" Gardiner, who engineered almost single-handedly the formation of Metropolitan Toronto in the 1950s.\n\nOn January 1, 1957, the Toronto Police merged with the other municipal forces in the metropolitan area to form the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force:\n\nWith amalgamation, the force grew in size and complexity, and Chisholm found himself unable to manage the huge agency and its Byzantine politics. In 1958, after a number of conflicts with Gardiner and members of the newly expanded Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners, Chief Chisholm drove to High Park on the city's west end, parked his car and committed suicide with his service revolver. Former staff superintendent Jack Webster, one of the officers who arrived at the scene of the chief's death and who would, upon his retirement in the 1990s, become the force historian at the Toronto Police Museum, would later write, \"Suicide is a constant partner in every police car.\"\n\nIn 1960, Lawrence \"Larry\" McLarty became the force's first black officer and paved the way regarding the hiring of minorities into the policing.\n\nIn 1990, the Board of Police Commissioners was renamed as the \"Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Police Services Board\", and, upon the creation of the amalgamated City of Toronto in 1998, it became the Toronto Police Services Board, administering the Toronto Police Service.\n\nToday, the Toronto Police Service is responsible for overall local police service in Toronto and works with the other emergency services (Toronto Paramedic Services and Toronto Fire Services) and other police forces in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) including:\n\nFor most of 2005, the police union and the Toronto Police Services Board (the civilian governing body) were involved in lengthy contract negotiations. The rank and file had been without a contract since the end of 2004, and conducted a work-to-rule campaign in the fall of 2005. The police force is an essential public service and are legally prohibited from striking. The Toronto Police Service launched their social media strategy on July 27, 2011 and \"has the most active Twitter accounts listed under a single police force in Canada\"\n\nIn 1988, Toronto Police were under scrutiny for the fatal shooting of schizophrenic Lester Donaldson. The shooting was the first of eight over the next four years, and the latest in series of shootings since the late 1970s, in which mostly unarmed black Canadians were victims. Three days after his death, the Black Action Defence Committee, a group of local activists, was formed. The group made headlines when they introduced the issue of race in the coroner's inquest into Donaldson's killing. In 1990, Toronto police officer David Deviney was charged with manslaughter in connection with the killing and was later acquitted.\n\nOn May 4, 1992, tension between Toronto Police and the city's black community reached its peak. After the fourth police killing of a young black man in as many years, a peaceful protest on Yonge Street later turned into a riot. Thirty people were arrested and 37 police officers were injured in the riot.\n\nA mandatory coroner's inquest took place into the police killing of 17-year-old Jeffrey Reodica. Although accounts differ, it is generally accepted that Reodica was part of a group of Filipino teenagers pursuing a group of white teenagers on May 21, 2004, in Scarborough, following altercations between the two groups. Plainclothes Toronto police officer Det.-Const. Dan Belanger and his partner Det. Allen Love were in the process of arresting Reodica when he was shot three times by the officers. The teen died in hospital three days later. Belanger and Love, were eventually cleared by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) who after investigating the matter found that there were no reasonable grounds to lay a charge. According to the SIU, Reodica brandished a knife at officers. A knife was reportedly recovered at the scene.\n\nIn response to the recommendations of the coroner's inquest jury, former chief Bill Blair recommended that all plainclothes police officers be issued arm bands and raid jackets bearing the word \"police\" in an effort to increase their visibility in critical situations. Unmarked cars, which were already equipped with a plug-in police light, were to be supplied with additional emergency equipment, including a siren package. The proposals were phased in over three years beginning in 2008. Undercover officers also must wear, carry or have access to standard police use-of-force options such as pepper spray and batons.\"\"\n\nIn 2004, eight people were shot by Toronto Police, six of them fatally. SIU investigations deemed all case actions justified.\n\nIn 2005, the police force was faced with a spike in shootings across Toronto and increased concern among residents. Police Chief William Blair and Mayor David Miller asked for additional resources and asked for diligence from residents to contend with this issue. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty promised to work with Toronto to fight crime.\n\nIn July 2007, Toronto Police were involved in an international incident in which their members pepper-sprayed, tasered, and handcuffed members of the Chilean national soccer team in an attempt to keep control of crowds after their semi-final match in the 2007 FIFA Under-20 World Cup. A police spokesman explained on CBC Radio on the programme \"Here and Now\" that police took action against individual members of the Chilean team when they \"displayed aggressive behaviour\" by vandalizing a bus and arguing with fans. The actions of the police were criticized by the TV and print media in Chile, and initially also in Canada. FIFA president Sepp Blatter later apologized to the Toronto mayor for the incident, and instigated disciplinary action against the officials and players of the Chilean team.\n\nOn July 27, 2013, 18-year-old Sammy Yatim was shot and killed by Constable James Forcillo on the 505 Dundas streetcar after threatening other passengers and the police with a knife. On August 19, 2013, Forcillo was charged with second-degree murder. In January 2016, Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder.\n\nIn January 2016, four Toronto Police officers were arrested and charged with nine counts of obstructing justice and eight counts of perjury.\n\nThe chief of police is the highest-ranking officer of the Toronto Police Service. The position was known as \"high constable\" until 1859 and then as \"chief constable\" until 1957, when the Toronto Police Department was amalgamated with 12 other Toronto-area forces to form the Metropolitan Toronto Police. Most chiefs have been chosen amongst the ranks of the Toronto force and promoted or appointed from the ranks of deputy chiefs; Fantino was hired from the York Regional Police, but he had been a career officer with Toronto Police prior, leaving as acting staff superintendent.\n\nToronto Police Department (1834–1956):\n\nHigh constables \n\n\nChief constables\n\n\nMetropolitan Toronto Police (1957–1995), Metropolitan Toronto Police Service (1995–1998), Toronto Police Service (1998–present)\n\nChiefs of police:\n\nAs an agency of the City of Toronto, the Toronto Police Service's annual funding level is established by a vote of the Toronto City Council in favour of the year's proposed budget. Provided below are historical gross and net funding levels of the Toronto Police Service as a part of the city's operating budgets.\n\nAs of 2011, a tentative agreement made Toronto Police the country's highest-paid officers by increasing wages over 11 per cent over four years.\n\nThe actions of the Toronto Police are examined by the Special Investigations Unit, a civilian agency responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and civilians that have resulted in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault. The SIU is dedicated to maintaining one law, ensuring equal justice before the law among both the police and the public. They assure that the criminal law is applied appropriately to police conduct, as determined through independent investigations, increasing public confidence in the police services. Complaints involving police conduct that do not result in a serious injury or death must be referred to the appropriate police service or to another oversight agency, such as the Ontario Civilian Commission.\n\nToronto Police Headquarters is located at 40 College Street, near Bay Street in the downtown area. The former headquarters at Jarvis Street was turned into a museum (which was subsequently re-located to the current headquarters). The present site was once home to the Toronto YMCA. The sign over the main entrance still reads \"Metropolitan Toronto Police Headquarters\" and displays the emblem of Metropolitan Toronto (which was dissolved in 1998). Since 2007, the sign also displays the current emblem of the Toronto Police Service.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service has approximately 5,400 uniformed officers/under cover officers and 2,500 civilian employees. Its officers are among the best paid in Canada. In October 2008, the Toronto Police Service was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service is divided into two field areas and 17 divisions (police stations or precincts):\n\n\nEncompasses the original city of Toronto, the former cities of York and East York and some southern portions of the former City of North York.\n\nEncompasses the former cities of North York, Scarborough and Etobicoke.\n\n\nThe public safety unit is located at 4610 Finch Avenue East.\n\nOperational services of the Toronto Police Service include:\n\nThe emergency task force is the tactical unit of the Toronto Police Service. It is mandated to deal with high-risk situations like gun calls, hostage takings, barricaded persons, emotionally disturbed persons, high risk arrests and warrant services, and protection details. The unit was created in 1965. An earlier non-SWAT riot and emergency squad emerged in 1961.\n\nPart of its role is now undertaken by the emergency task force, public safety and emergency management and the mounted unit.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service is one of several police forces along Lake Ontario with a marine unit. Prior to the 1980s, the port area had their own police force, Toronto Harbour Police/Port of Toronto Police which merged into the Metropolitan Police Force's marine unit. The unit's has the largest jurisdictional area of any unit in the Toronto Police Service, policing over of open water, from the Etobicoke Creek to the Rouge River.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service has a fleet of 24 boats based either at the main station of the unit, at 259 Queens Quay West in Harbourfront; or at one of its three substations, at Humber Bay, the Scarborough Bluffs, and the Toronto Islands.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service Marine Unit works in conjunction with other municipal and regional police units that operate marine units in Lake Ontario, including the Durham Regional Police, Halton Regional Police, Hamilton Police Service, Niagara Regional Police Service, and the Peel Regional Police. The Marine Unit also works in conjunction with the neighbouring York Regional Police, although their marine unit is based in Lake Simcoe. In addition to municipal/regional police services, the Toronto Police Service Marine Unit also works in conjunction with the Canadian Forces Search and Rescue Unit based in CFB Trenton, and the Toronto Search and Rescue volunteer service (which has ties to the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary).\n\nThe horse unit was formed in 1886 to provide crowd control and is now stationed at the Horse Palace at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). The unit has been based at Casa Loma, Toronto Zoo, Sunnybrook Stables and at various division in Scarborough and North York. The unit has a strength of 27 horses and 40 officers.\n\nPolice horses Honest Ed and Spencer were invited to the inauguration of US President Barack Obama by Michigan's Multi-Jurisdictional Mounted Police Drill Team and Color Guard.\n\nThree horses have been killed while on duty. They include Lancer, following a motor vehicle collision in 2002; Brigadier (born 1998 near Listowel, Ontario) after an intentional motor vehicle collision in 2006; and Royal Sun, following a torn leg ligament in 2012.\n\nParking enforcement on all roads and public property are the responsibility of the Toronto Police and work with Toronto Parking Authority. Parking enforcement officers are provincial offences officers able to issue parking tickets under part II of the \"Ontario Provincial Offences Act\". They do not carry any use of force items and are unarmed, but are issued Kevlar vests for safety. They are peace officers pursuant to section 15 of the \"Police Services Act of Ontario\" for the purpose of enforcing municipal by-laws.\n\nTheir uniform consists of a blue shirt, black cargo pants with blue stripe, a black vest and a cap with blue stripe. Boots are similar to front line police officers. In winter months, parking enforcement officers have a blue jacket with reflective trim. Patches on the jackets and shirts are similar to those of the Toronto Police Service, but with a white back ground the blue wording \"parking enforcement\".\n\nTheir vehicles have the same paint scheme as the older Toronto Police Service squad cars, but they are labelled with '\"parking enforcement\" and fleet numbers \"PKE\" (east) or \"PKW\" (west).\n\nThe Toronto Police Service police dog unit was created in 1989 and is deployed to search for suspects, missing persons and other duties. The service has 17 general purpose dogs. There are four drug enforcement dogs and one explosives detector dog. The 21 officers and dogs are assigned to this unit and based at 44 Beechwood Drive in Toronto East York\n\nToronto Police dogs that have died during their service, including Keno, a firearms detector, and Luke, a general service dog; both in 2011.\n\nAs 400-series highways are owned by the province of Ontario, policing on 400-series highways within the city of Toronto (highways 401, 400, 427, 404) are the responsibility of the Ontario Provincial Police (though all Ontario police officers have province-wide jurisdiction). \n\nToronto Police Traffic Services is responsible for patrolling on local roads and municipal expressways (W.R. Allen Road, Don Valley Parkway, F.G. Gardiner Expressway and the Toronto section of Highway 409); traffic services has a \"60\" or \"66 Division\" (60xx or 66xx) designation on their cars.\n\nToronto Police previously employed lifeguards, responsible for patrolling 11 beaches and 44 kilometres of shoreline during the summer months, who were are assisted by the Toronto Police Service (including the marine unit), Toronto Paramedic Services and Toronto Fire Services.\n\nIn 2017 as part of a modernization initiative, the Toronto Police Lifeguard Service was transferred to the Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation Division.\n\nThe morality department was formed in 1886, when then Mayor William Holmes Howland appointed ex-Royal Irish Constabulary officer David Archibald to head this special unit of the Toronto Police Service to deal specifically with \"vice, sin, and crimes which heavily impacted women and children\". Howland had just won Toronto's mayoral race that year by promising to make Toronto a beacon of morality for the world, even going so far as to give Toronto the moniker, \"Toronto the Good\". The department ran through the 1930s, and was seen as a forerunner to many social assistance programs, such as the Children's Aid Society. It was set up under a social purist pretext of policing people's everyday behaviours so that Toronto might live up to Howland's moniker. Among the offences, though not necessarily crimes, that morality officers policed were gambling, \"blue laws\" or \"Sabbath laws\", being an absentee father, drug dealing, interracial relationships, homosexuality, bootlegging and alcoholism, vagrancy, family abuse and prostitution. The people in power who wrote these laws, such as Howland, and created the morality department said that they were there to protect moral and good people from the evils of the city. However, when examining the direct implementation/enforcement of these laws, and the effects they had on civilian life, the larger purpose of the morality department was to prevent working-class people from socializing or coming together, and thereby to keep them in a generally less powerful position.\n\nThe roots of this social purity doctrine can be traced back to the belief in the good of British colonialism, ideas still holding strong in the late 19th century in Canada, as Canada's national identity was still strongly linked to British ideals. The assumption is that bad people behave objectively badly, and that these people need to made good by a sovereign government. This government does so by limiting the civilian population's freedoms and regulating their social interactions to ensure that people remain \"moral and good\", and thereby can make a new generation of \"moral and good\" people. Of course everyone would fall under these practices who was not seen to be morally, or socially, good, but women and people of colour were seen by the government as inherently lesser or more susceptible to temptation or sin, and so they were policed far more heavily than their white or male counterparts. The resulting system of social governing, was easily abused to keep a divide between classes wide, through methods like disproportionately enforcing the laws when the accused were of lower classes, making special exemptions for people who lived or served those who lived in the higher classes. And, once again, since women and people of colour were seen as inherently more susceptible to temptation, they were automatically made targets of the system's efforts to socially reform people.\n\nThe officers' methods often, called for them to threaten fines or jail time rather than arrest all offenders, which made them popular among people as a social service. People knew that they probably would not be arrested or get the unwanted publicity that goes along with being arrested and going through the public courts. In this way, these officers became regulators of the community. Ordinary people interacted with them, and thereby came to trust them. As a result, these officers had many people willing to give them information on who might be a suspected drug dealer, prostitute, gambler or absentee father.\n\nThe primary focus of the anti-prostitution laws was to make prostitution unprofitable so that women would instead pursue legitimate ways to make money. In essence, the people who put these laws in place were attempting to save women from a life of prostitution. The legitimate forms of employment were few and far between; maid, secretary and factory worker were the only plentiful options, and each of those put women in a position where they were constantly subordinate to another. Prostitution had a much wider definition to the social purists of the time than it does now. For example, if a man bought a woman dinner and the woman then went home with him, that was considered prostitution. Thus, any women, and especially working-class women without social standing, who sought out men were persecuted, though not prosecuted. Seemingly innocuous behaviours, such as walking alone at night, might also get a woman arrested for prostitution.\n\nThe Sabbath laws (alternatively known as \"blue laws\") were a series of laws designed to prevent people from working on the Sabbath, commonly known as Sunday, to respect the Abrahamic God's day of rest. They, like most laws enforced by the morality department, disproportionately affected working-class people and favoured the upper class. One of the best examples of this was the fact that taxis used by the public to get around were not allowed to work on Sunday, but private chauffeurs of the wealthy were. Beyond preventing many forms of work, they also prevented people from doing certain leisure activities that could be interpreted as work. Similar to the taxi driver–chauffeur contradiction, ball games for children in public on Sundays but still allowing for games of golf at private clubs. Such contradictions led people to believe that these laws were put in place to prevent working-class people from consorting with each other, to keep them separate and easy to manage.\n\nFor most of their operating time, the majority of their work was finding absentee fathers from Canada, the U.S. and Great Britain, and then coercing them into paying maintenance payments. These maintenance payments would go towards supporting their wives and children. This re-enforced a family structure where the father was a provider and the mother was unable to support herself or her family. As attitudes towards policing among the upper ranks moved away from social management and into crime and punishment in the 1920s, it came to be that the police and social activist groups alike agreed that this work was no longer a job for the police. In 1929, the newly established family court system took over the management of these payments.\n\nMorality officer was one of the first roles within the police force, not including secretary, that women were allowed to fulfill. In the early 1910s, they were brought in under the idea that they would be better suited to deal with young women who had been acting immorally, and that they would themselves be a moralizing influence in the police service. Also, the existence of policewomen was an encouragement for women to come forward with assault charges against their abusive husbands. Women would trust that if they went to a police officer who was also female, then something would be more likely to get done. Yet, the majority of their duties included arresting and searching female suspects, and interviewing female suspects and victims. As well, rather than being on the beat in dangerous parts of town, they would be searching for people, though mostly women, acting immorally, particularly in places where men and women came together. They were never tasked the same duties as their male counterparts, and so were seen more as social workers within the police force than actual members of the force. Through the 1920s, feminists argued that these policewomen were taken on by police for show more than to be actual policewomen, and interest from the upper ranks in policewomen faded along with their interest in social management, since the upper ranks saw the two as being deeply connected. Few more women were taken on until after World War II, and those that were there gained little ground for women in the police force.\n\nAdult crossing guards at various intersections and crosswalks were employed and paid by the Toronto Police Service, however, as part of a modernization initiative, the crossing guard program was transferred to the City of Toronto in 2017.\n\nThe rank insignia of the Toronto Police Service is similar to that used by police services elsewhere in Canada and in the United Kingdom, except that the usual \"pips\" are replaced by maple leaves. The St. Edward's Crown is found on insignia of staff sergeant, all superintendent ranks and all commanding officer ranks.\n\nBesides the chief of police, the other command officers are the deputy chiefs. They head the command units.\n\nChief administrative officer is a civilian post, Corporate Support Command, held by Tony Veneziano\n\nThe day-to-day and regional operations are commanded by senior officers:\n\nInvestigations are divided into crimes against persons and crimes against property. These investigations are conducted by:\n\n\n\nRanks\n\n\nNew and current officers of the Toronto Police Service train at the Toronto Police College in Etobicoke on Birmingham east of Islington. The initial training is three weeks, followed by 12 weeks at the Ontario Police College in Aylmer, Ontario and then nine weeks of final training at Toronto Police College. Charles O. Bick College was closed in July 2009. In August 2018, TPS acquired TTC Orion VII buses 7900-7905 for purposes such as roadblocks, mass transport and training. These units are now numbered ES-0 through ES-5. ES stands for Events Support. The following units were painted black prior to being sent to TPS. In November 2018, these units were repainted in a gray and white livery similar to the LFLRV livery on TTC vehicles. The following units are maintained and stored by the TTC. They are currently stored at Birchmount Garage in Scarborough.\n\nFront line officers wear dark navy blue shirts, cargo pants (with red stripe) and boots. Winter jackets are either dark navy blue jacket design–Eisenhower style, single-breasted front closing, two patch type breast pockets, shoulder straps, gold buttons—or yellow windbreaker style with the word POLICE in reflective silver and black at the back (generally worn by the bicycle and traffic services units). All ranks shall wear dark navy blue clip on ties when wearing long-sleeve uniforms.\n\nHats can be styled after baseball caps, combination caps, or fur trim Yukon (similar to the Ushanka) hats for winter. Motorcycle units have white helmets. Black or reflective yellow gloves are also provided to officers with Traffic Services. Front line officers usually wear combination caps since that is the location of their badge. Prior to the 1990s, female officers wore bowler caps instead of combination caps. Auxiliary officers wear combination caps with a checkered red and black band. The Mounted Unit wear black Canadian military fur wedge cap during the winter months and custodian helmet for ceremonial use.\n\nAs is the case with all Ontario law enforcement officers, uniformed officers wear name tags. They are in the style of \"A. Example\" where the first letter of the first name is written and the last name next to it, with a Canadian flag to the left of the name. Name tags are usually stitched on with white stitching on a black background, but they also have pin-styled with black lettering on a gold plate.\n\nSenior officers wear white shirts and a black Eisenhower style jacket. Auxiliary officers wear light blue shirts (long sleeve for winter and short for summer), with the badging of auxiliary on the bottom of the crest. Originally front line officer also wore light blue shirts but changed to the current navy blue shirts in the Fall of 2000.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service logo is very similar to the old Metropolitan Toronto Police logo, and it includes the following components:\n\nThe shield in the Toronto Police Service logo is from the coat of arms of the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. The TPS logo is also similar to the emblem of the former Metropolitan Toronto School Board. Prior to the formation of the Metropolitan Toronto Police, the Toronto Police Department officers wore a generic Scully badge on their caps, a common shield used by Canadian police forces in the 19th century and early 20th century. This featured a metallic maple leaf with a beaver and crown.\n\nPolice cars, also known as \"police cruisers\", are the standard equipment used by Toronto Police officers for transportation. The vehicles would include a rotator lightbar as its emergency vehicle lighting, which is still popular with the TPS. The vehicles are numbered according to their division and car number. For example, 3322 represents that the vehicle is from 33 Division, and the following 22 is the vehicle designation number.\n\nThe current design since August 2017 is partly dark grey, with white doors with black text that says \"TORONTO POLICE\". Briefly, in, the design was entirely dark grey, with white lettering. The cars were redesigned following public controversy over its low visibility and \"militaristic styling\". An earlier design sometimes still seen is a white base with red and blue markings, and stealth vehicles are grey with reflective markings. \n\nPrevious scheme was yellow base with blue lettering.\n\nOther fleet numbering patterns include:\n\nThe Toronto Police Service has about 500 vehicles in their fleet.\n\nAn unmarked Cessna 206 H (C-FZRR) was registered with the Toronto Police Service and been used for undisclosed surveillance work. The plane has been alleged to have been used during the Rob Ford substance abuse scandal. C-FZRR was sold in 2015 to Sky Photo Techniques. Air (helicopter) support is provided by York Regional Police through a mutual support agreement.\n\n\nThe Toronto Police Service formerly used Smith & Wesson revolvers prior to switching to Glock.\n\nWeapons used by the Emergency Task Force include:\n\n\n"}

The actual channel is between Macquarie Heads on the west and Entrance Island on the east (the main length of the harbour runs southeast of Hells Gates). There is a wider area of water between Entrance Island and Macquarie Head, but it is too shallow to get a boat over.\nBraddon Point is the name of the feature on the eastern shore, while the shallow water south of the point is named Fraser Flats, and the channel adjacent to the breakwater is known as \"Kelly Channel\".\n\nThe name of the channel relates to the original convicts' claim that it was their point of 'entrance to Hell', their Hell being the Macquarie Harbour Penal Station on Sarah Island and the outlying surrounds of the harbour.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1902 the \"Macquarie Harbour Entrance Works\" involved the building of a breakwater and the channel was dredged. Parts of the breakwater can still be seen despite the passage of time. The Strahan Marine Board was involved with the monitoring of the mouth until 19 May 1970, when the Hobart Marine Board took over.\n\nBoth Entrance and Bonnet Islands have lights, and they were built before the Cape Sorell lighthouse.\n\nDue to the precarious entrance, and the changes in the hydrology of the area, charts and maps were updated regularly while Strahan was a port of importance – some of these maps are now available online.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2186980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2186980", "title": "Nunney", "text": "Nunney\n\nNunney is a village and civil parish near Frome in the Mendip local government district within the English county of Somerset. The parish includes the hamlet of Holwell.\n\nThe name of the village comes from Old English and means \"Nunna's island\".\n\nToday, the tourist attractions are the ruins of Nunney Castle, a historic church, and ducks wandering the streets near the river. The village hall is host to Nunney Acoustic Cafe which provides live music, homemade food, a bar and children's art activities on the second Sunday of each month (except July and August).\n\nOn 30 September 2007, Nunney was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 report, asking whether \"the prettiest village in England\" is a place where we can learn \"how to mend our broken society\".\n\nEvidence of Roman settlement has been provided by the discovery of a hoard of Roman coins in 1869 at Westdown Farm and a villa with a mosaic floor.\n\nNunney is mentioned as a manor belonging to William de Moyon in the Domesday Book in 1086, but the book does not mention a castle.\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Frome.\n\nFor many years, from the medieval period until the 19th century, Nunney was the site of water-powered mills owned initially by the Hoddinotts and then by James Fussell.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nThe village falls within 'Cranmore,Doulting and Nunney' electoral ward. Starting at Doulting in the west the ward stretches eastwards through Cranmore and \"Nunney\" to finish in the east at Whatley. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,374.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.\n\nCloford Quarry is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Geological Conservation Review site important for the exposures of sediments of Triassic and Jurassic age which occur in major fissures within the Carboniferous Limestone laid down beneath the sea some 350 million years ago.\n\nThe Holwell Quarries are another geological Site of Special Scientific Interest which represent an internationally important geological locality. A comprehensive assemblage of Triassic (including Rhaetic), Lower Jurassic and Middle Jurassic fissure fillings are well displayed. The Rhaetic fissure fillings have yielded the richest assemblage of vertebrate faunas known from the British Triassic.\n\nAlong with the rest of South West England, Nunney has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.\n\nCloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.\n\nThe market cross across the road from the church is Grade II* listed. It was originally built around 1100, when stood in the churchyard of All Saints' Church. It was removed in 1869, as the noise from children playing on the steps annoyed the rector. The stone was discovered in a builders yard and rebuilt in his garden by the squire of Whatley and the Celtic cross added. After his death and a fire which destroyed his house, the cross was again dismantled and rebuilt on its present site in 1959.\n\nThere are over 30 other listed buildings in the village, including Rockfield House which was built in 1805 by John Pinch.\n\nThe Church of All Saints is a Grade I listed building dating from the 12th century.\n\nNunney Castle is a small, French-style castle surrounded by a deep moat, built for Sir John Delamare in 1373, and said to have been based on the Bastille in Paris, and shows a strong awareness of contemporary French practice. It was later the property of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, before passing to several owners and in 1577 was sold by Swithun Thorpe to John Parker who only kept it for a year before selling it to Richard Prater, at a cost of £2000. During the English Civil Wars (1642–51) Colonel Richard Prater, who held the castle until 1645, lost it to Fairfax, the commander of Cromwell's forces in the battle that took place at Nunney. The castle was besieged for two days, but capitulated when Cromwell's men used cannon to blast a great hole in the north west wall of the castle.\n\n\"The George at Nunney\" Inn is close to the church and opposite Nunney Castle. It dates from the mid-18th century. Since that time it has been much extended and is now a 10 bedroom hotel with holiday cottages. The interior still features many of the original features with stone walls, exposed beams, and large open fireplaces. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe Nunney Players are a Drama group, who meet up every year to put on a performance at the village hall. The Nunney Players have won many awards and have put on shows such as Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk and Pinocchio.\n\nThe village website, run by Visit Nunney community interest company (CIC), was a finalist for UK Information/News Website of the Year in The Good Web Guide Awards in November 2014.\n\n\n"}

Microfluidic processes such as electrophoresis can be implemented by bioprocessors to aid in DNA isolation and purification.\n"}

It left the main line of the Ashton Canal at Fairfield Junction immediately above lock 18. It was just over long and went through Droylsden and Waterhouses to terminate at Hollinwood Basin (Hollinwood Top Wharf). It rose through four locks at Waterhouses (19–22) and another four at Hollinwood (23–26). Immediately above lock 22 at Waterhouses was Fairbottom Junction where the Fairbottom Branch Canal started. Beyond Hollinwood Basin there was a lock free private branch, known as the Werneth Branch Canal, to Old Lane Colliery, which opened in 1797. It is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Local Nature Reserve.\n\nThe Hollinwood Branch Canal was comparatively rural in character apart from mills and factories at Droylsden. Its main purpose was to carry coal from numerous local collieries to the many mills and factories in the neighbourhood of the Ashton Canal. Passengers were also carried along its length.\n\nThis canal was extensively used until about 1928 when trade began to decline rapidly due to competition from railways and roads. However, this was not the only problem as mining subsidence was becoming serious and it unofficially closed in 1932, although parts of it remained navigable. It was not until 1955 that most of it was officially closed and the short remaining section from the main line at Fairfield Junction was officially closed in 1961.\n\nMuch of the line of the former canal remained intact, and there are now plans to re-open it as an amenity canal; these plans have the support of the local authorities. However, the problems of restoring this canal are far more challenging than those of restoring the Stockport Branch Canal. Not only is it suffering from the effects of mining subsidence but also its line has been severed twice by the Manchester ring road, which would require the construction of aqueducts to cross it. Another aqueduct would also be required to replace one across a railway that was demolished some time ago. The line up to Hollinwood Basin could not be restored because buildings now obstruct it but there are plans to connect the rest of it to the Rochdale Canal by means of a short new canal from just below the site of lock 23. Such a link was originally planned in 1792, but never constructed.\n\nThe first part of the restoration has started, with a £100 Million redevelopment scheme for Droylsden including housing, flats, restaurants, shops and offices, centred on a new marina which is connected to the line of the canal, and which was opened in September 2008. About of canal from the junction with the Ashton Canal have been refurbished, and new waterside facilities for boaters are available near lock 18. The original plans would have blocked further restoration of the canal, but were changed after representations were made by the Hollinwood Canal Society, and the canal will now pass under a building which will span the route.\n\nThe Hollinwood Branch Canal at Waterhouses is unique among Britain’s canals and it is now part of the Daisy Nook Country Park owned by the National Trust. In it included every type of canal feature, as well as some more unusual ones as well. Over this length these features were once to be found, starting and ending with road bridges over the canal:\n\nMention must be made of a neighbour of the pumping engine known as ‘\"Fairbottom Bobs\"’. This was a Newcomen steam engine (more accurately a Newcomen atmospheric engine) used to pump water from a coal mine. The water was pumped along a wooden flume for a distance of about and then discharged into the Fairbottom Branch Canal at Fenny Fields Bridge.\n\nIn 1929 this engine was dismantled and taken to the United States by Henry Ford who had it completely restored. It was then placed at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nThe name \"Fairbottom Bobs\" is older than the Newcomen engine. It was used to describe the pumps driven by water wheels driven by the River Medlock. The 'bobs' were L-shaped linkages designed to convert the circular motion of the wheels into an up-and-down pumping action. Early maps show the Newcomen engine as \"Mr. Lees' Engine\" and the Ashton Company had to negotiate with Mr. Lees (in 1798) to have the water redirected into the canal when it was built.\n\n\n"}

The music and lyrics were written by Ben Ryan (1892–1968) in 1926. It reminisces about being in a youthful quartet, singing \"Heart of My Heart\".\n\nThe quoted line, \"Heart of My Heart\", so longed for in the 1926 song, begins the chorus of \"The Story of the Rose\", written by Andrew Mack (1863–1931) in 1899. Mack was a popular American actor, singer and comedian who reportedly first sang this song in an 1899 show at the Academy of Music in New York City. The show was \"The Last of the Rohans\", written and produced by Mack.\n\n\"The Story of the Rose\" is a standard among barbershop quartets the world over. It is one of the most popular songs sung on Valentine's Day, when quartets deliver Singing Valentines to oft–unsuspecting recipients going about their lives in their homes, offices, classrooms, shops, train stops, and other places. In this context, the verses are usually omitted and only the chorus (\"Heart of My Heart\") is sung.\n\n\nAccording to the book \"Grace and Power: The Private World of the Kennedy White House\" by Sally Bedell Smith, this song was a particular favorite of U.S. President John F. Kennedy; the book mentions that the president often asked his younger brother Teddy to sing it at family gatherings.\n\nThe music of \"The Gang that Sang\" was used for the 1954 French song \"Plus je t'embrasse\". The French lyrics, by Max François, bear no relation to the English lyrics. Jazz versions of \"Plus je t'embrasse\" have been recorded by Blossom Dearie and by Diana Panton.\n\nIn the \"Get Smart\" episode \"Weekend Vampire,\" an attempt to reconstruct a tune heard just as a murder was committed led to an enthusiastic—if irrelevant—rendition of the 1926 song by Max, the Chief, and detect-o-tune operator Arrick (Roger Price).\n"}
{"id": "2187010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187010", "title": "The Dambuilders", "text": "The Dambuilders\n\nThe Dambuilders was an indie rock band that began in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, in 1989 and later relocated to Boston. They released seven LPs (six studio albums & one compilation) and a number of EPs before breaking up in 1998. Members have gone on with other musical projects, most notably the band's violinist/vocalist, Joan Wasser, as Joan as Police Woman.\n\nThe Dambuilders was a band in the early 1990s Boston rock scene. The founding members - Dave Derby, Tryan George and Eric Masunaga, all from Hawaii - had played in a number of bands (such as the Exactones) before moving to Boston in 1990. The band began as the Dambuilders in Hawaii in a three-piece and four-piece configuration. Early violin was provided by Debbie Fox. With Fox's involvement, nearly all of the band's songs had electric violin tracks. Around 1992, the \"classic line-up\" consisted of Derby (bass guitar and lead vocals), Masunaga (guitar), Kevin March (drums) and Joan Wasser (violin). Many of the band's early recordings were engineered by Masunaga.\n\nWhile The Dambuilders are generally considered an \"indie\" band, they received some commercial airplay with the single \"Shrine\" from the 1994 Atlantic Records release \"Encendedor\". Although the song has no traditional chorus, The Dambuilders manage to create an appealing and memorable single using a distinctly melodic verse and an innovative instrumental section used as an intro, outro and bridge. Also contributing to the song's sound is the playing of bass chords. The song tells of a cross-cultural romantic courtship between the singer and a girl who \"doesn't speak much English\" but is familiar with the American music scene. In the song, the singer is willing to conform to traditional religious practices outside his own cultural sphere (\"...if I stay with her I'll lose track of all time, so I light a candle to the shrine...\"), but seemingly manages to stay true to his roots by redefining the acts as an aspect of his own non-religious, culturally inclusive belief system (\"...and call it Rock n' Roll\"). Shrine was recently ranked #17 in the MTV's 100 greatest songs of the '90s: Lollapalooza list.\n\nTheir 1997 album, \"Against the Stars\", was released by Elektra Records. In 1999 the band performed in Toronto.\n\nCurrently, Derby and March are performing together as members of Gramercy Arms. Wasser has performed on both of their albums including a vocal duet with Lloyd Cole on the band's \"Beautiful Disguise\" single and video. The band, which also includes Sean Eden (Luna), Rainy Orteca (Dead Air, Joan as Police Woman, Lloyd Cole), Hilken Mancini (The Count Me Outs, Fuzzy, Colburn-Mancini), Sandy Smallens (Too Much Joy) as well as guest performances by Doug Gillard (Guided By Voices), Matthew Caws (Nada Surf), Renee LoBue (Elk City), Lloyd Cole, Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine) released its first album, called \"Gramercy Arms\", in 2009 and is currently working on a follow up. Derby's other output includes two releases under the \"Brilliantine\" name, as well two solo albums (\"Even Further Behind\" and \"Dave Derby and the Norfolk Downs\").\n\nWasser is now performing under the name Joan as Police Woman and released her first solo E.P., \"Joan As Police Woman\", in June 2005. She released a full-length album with the band, entitled \"Real Life\", in June 2006, followed by \"To Survive\" in June 2008, \"Cover\" in 2009, and \"The Deep Field\" in January 2011.\n\nMarch was also a member of Guided by Voices for several years and continues to do session work and tours with various artists. He is currently putting together a new group with his old friend, Nathan Larson of Shudder To Think. \nMasunaga now runs Modulus Studios, a mastering and DVD authoring studio, in Boston.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His gimmick was a Texan cowboy who entered World Wrestling Federation (WWF) rings to the sound of a bullwhip.\n\nHeard started wrestling as Ron Bass in 1971 in the Gulf Coast territory. Throughout the 1970s, he performed primarily in National Wrestling Alliance territories. He was known as \"Cowboy\" Ron Bass, Sam Oliver Bass, and \"Outlaw\" Ron Bass, depending on which territory he was working at the time.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he wrestled in Championship Wrestling from Florida and Jim Crockett Promotions, frequently teaming with Black Bart as The Long Riders in both promotions. He also teamed and feuded with Barry Windham in Florida.As a face he would feud with Angelo Mosca and Kendo Nagasaki. Would later turn heel after turning on Dusty Rhodes where he was a special referee in a match against Harley Race costing Rhodes the NWA title. Bass' feud with Barry Windham (over a saddle given to Bass by Dusty Rhodes) led to Windham losing a \"loser-leaves-town\" match to Bass and coming back to wrestle as the masked \"Dirty Yellow Dog. \"\n\nIn 1987, Bass (using the \"Outlaw\" name) went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he voiced challenges to the likes of WWF champion Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake. Bass quickly settled into a role in the midcard position, wrestling against Hillbilly Jim, Lanny Poffo and Sam Houston. Later on he was part of the five-man team captained by The Honky Tonk Man at the inaugural Survivor Series pay-per-view on Thanksgiving Day 1987. He also participated in the very first Royal Rumble and the 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. He was eliminated at the latter event by the Junkyard Dog; a feud between the two began in the months after WrestleMania after Bass choked and dragged the Dog with his bullwhip, \"Miss Betsy,\" in a sneak attack on \"Wrestling Challenge\". He also joined Gorilla Monsoon at the broadcast table one week on \"Wrestling Challenge\" to cover for Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, who was recovering from his storyline injury from Ken Patera.\n\nAt the 1988 King of the Ring tournament, Bass qualified for the final after beating a young Shawn Michaels but was paid by Ted DiBiase to fake an injury. Bass began a feud with Beefcake in August 1988, gouging Beefcake's head open with his spurs (\"Bret\" and \"Bart\") on an episode of \"Superstars of Wrestling\"; the attack caused Beefcake to miss his scheduled Intercontinental championship match against the Honky Tonk Man at the first SummerSlam event on August 29. Bass and Honky co-captained a five-man contingent against a team captained by Beefcake and the Ultimate Warrior at the second Survivor Series in November. Bass and teammate Greg Valentine were eliminated by Warrior in succession in the final minute of the match. On the January 7, 1989 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XIX\", Bass lost to Beefcake via sleeperhold in a hair vs. hair match. He competed in the 1989 Royal Rumble (sans hair), Bass' feud with Beefcake was scrapped, and he was used mainly as a preliminary wrestler and left the WWF shortly thereafter.\n\nBass wrestled in the independents before retiring in 1991 due to the injuries sustained over his career. In 2005, he made an appearance at WrestleReunion on January 29 and teamed with Larry Zbyszko to defeat Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda.\n\nBass and Brian Blair both starred in the film \"Silent Times\" directed by Geoff Blanchette and Christopher Annino, which was released in 2018. Bass plays a 1920s professional football coach named Coach Joseph Arcarese.\n\nAfter retiring, Heard returned to Tampa, Florida, where he golfed, became religious, and earned his bachelor's degree from Arkansas State University. Subsequently, he worked in sales in Florida's construction market. He also became an Amway salesman in the Tampa area. He had one son.\n\nIn July 2016, Heard was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. Following his death, in December 2018, Kyros' law firm received a postmortem report from the Heard family stating he had suffered from Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has become common among professional wrestlers. Over a year after his death, US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\nIn March 2017, Heard was hospitalized due to a burst appendix. He died on March 7 at the age of 68 due to complications following surgery.\n\n\n\n"}

His younger sister Ida (1863–1944) married the geologist and geographer Albrecht Penck in 1886, the geomorphologist Walther Penck was Ganghofer's nephew. He graduated from gymnasium secondary school in 1873 and subsequently worked as a fitter in Augsburg engine works. In 1875, he entered Munich Polytechnic as a student of mechanical engineering, but eventually changed his major to history of literature and philosophy, which subjects he studied in Munich, Berlin and Leipzig. In 1879, he was awarded a doctorate from the Leipzig University.\n\nGanghofer wrote his first play \"Der Herrgottschnitzer von Ammergau\" (\"The Crucifix Carver of Ammergau\") in 1880 for the Munich Gärtnerplatz Theatre, where it was given 19 performances. But his breakthrough was a guest performance of this play in Berlin, where it was staged more than 100 times. Subsequently, Ganghofer worked as dramaturge at the Ringtheater in Vienna (1881), as a freelance writer for the family paper \"Die Gartenlaube\" and as a feuilleton editor of the \"Neues Wiener Tagblatt\" (1886–1891). In Vienna, Ganghofer was a frequent guest at the salon in the Palais Todesco, where he met with artists like Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Johann Strauss. From 1891, he worked mainly as a writer of Alpine novels, inspired by the sojourns at his hunting lodge near Leutasch in Tyrol; but he also produced e.g. Hugo von Hofmannsthal's play \"Der Tor und der Tod\". He also founded the Munich Literary Society.\n\nHis work as a voluntary war correspondent from 1915 and 1917 is less known. During those years, he wrote – besides propagandistic war reports e.g. \"Reise zur deutschen Front\" (\"Travel to the German frontlines\") – a large number of patriotic war poems, which were published in collections like \"Eiserne Zither\" (\"Iron Zither\") and \"Neue Kriegslieder\" (\"New War Songs\"). Being a personal friend of Emperor Wilhelm II and his favourite poet, Ganghofer's war reports frequently lauded the emperor and Paul von Hindenburg and their conduct of the war. Until shortly before the German capitulation, he continued to publish calls not to give up fighting. He was seriously wounded in the war and was awarded the Iron Cross. In 1917 he and his friend Ludwig Thoma joined the far-right German Fatherland Party which was dissolved in the Revolution of 1918–19, and his political activities ceased. Heavily criticised by colleagues like Karl Kraus, readings of his militaristic works provided him with an above average income.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Ganghofer returned to his profession as a writer. He dedicated his last work \"Das Land der Bayern in Farbenphotographie\" (\"The country of Bavaria in coloured photography\") to \"His Majesty King Ludwig III of Bavaria in deepest reverence\". Shortly afterwards, Ganghofer died in Tegernsee.\n\nGanghofer's works, in particular his novels, are still published nowadays. By 2004, it is estimated that more than 30 million copies of his works had been sold. Besides, among German authors Ganghofer's works have been some of the most frequently adapted as films, starting with silent films in the 1910s and 1920s, and continuing during the \"Heimatfilm\" era after World War II. His homeland novels earned Ganghofer the reputation as a \"\"healthy world\" writer\". His works which describe the life of simple, competent, honest people are often seen as kitsch – not least because most of them are staged against the background of an idyllic Bavarian Alps scenery.\n\n\n\nThe novel \"Die Sünden der Väter\" is perhaps most widely known as it was used as the basis of the flawed book cipher in \"The Good Soldier Švejk\".\n\n"}

A widget was added to the title bar in addition to the double-click method of collapsing a window. The entire feature disappeared with the release of Mac OS X; windows could be minimized to the Dock on the new system or, starting with Mac OS X 10.3, moved aside with Exposé. However, several third-party utilities, such as WindowShade X for Unsanity's Application Enhancer software, have brought the ability back to Mac OS. It has since reappeared as a commercial haxie and offers other features, like translucent windows and minimize-in-place. WindowShade X from Unsanity stopped working in Mac OS 10.7, and other third-party developers have since released applications such as WindowMizer from RGB World that keep the WindowShade feature working on Mac OS X 10.6 and greater.\n\nThe WindowShade control panel itself stems from a third-party utility originally written for System 6.0.7 by Rob Johnston.

He was first elected to the Greek Parliament in 1926 representing his native prefecture of Aetolia-Acarnania, and was repeatedly elected to office until 1964.\n\nA lawyer by trade, he served as Minister for the Interior in 1945, Minister for Education in 1950 and Minister for Industry in 1951.\n\nIn 1961, however, he was one of many conservatives who joined the Center Union (EK), in opposition to the corruption of right-wing governments at the time. In 1964, after EK came into power, he became Speaker of the Greek Parliament.\n\nOn July 15, 1965 he was appointed Prime Minister of Greece by king Constantine II, after the latter dismissed Georgios Papandreou, a move that is known as Apostasia of 1965.

{"id": "2187045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187045", "title": "Girolamo Zanchi", "text": "Girolamo Zanchi\n\nGirolamo Zanchi (Latin \"Hieronymus Zanchius,\" thus Anglicized to \"Jerome Zanchi/Zanchius\"; February 2, 1516 – November 19, 1590) was an Italian Protestant Reformation clergyman and educator who influenced the development of Reformed theology during the years following John Calvin's death.\n\nHe was born the son of a noble lawyer and historian, in Alzano Lombardo near Bergamo. His father died in the plague of 1528 and his mother died only three years later. At age 15 he entered the monastery of the Augustinian Order of Regular Canons, where he studied Aristotle, languages and divinity. After completing his studies, he went to Lucca, and there under the influence of Peter Martyr Vermigli he opted for a theological career, being especially impressed by Vermigli's lectures on Romans. In addition to works of the Fathers, he became aware of Martin Bucer and Philipp Melanchthon, also read Martin Luther's writings and the Swiss reformers. John Calvin, however, had the greatest influence on him.\n\nEven after Vermigli’s forced flight in 1542, Zanchi remained as a teacher of Greek at the monastery school. In 1551, however, he also was forced into exile. After a brief stay in Geneva, he wanted to go to England, but was called to Strasbourg and worked there as a professor of the Old Testament at the college of St. Thomas. His style is legalistic, and he interpreted with meticulous accuracy. In his overall theological orientation, he has been described as \"a Calvinist in terms of theological content, and a Thomist in terms of philosophy and methodology.\" He was one of the most learned theologians of the second half of the 16th Century, if he is not considered to be an especially original thinker. He was regarded an excellent teacher. He married a daughter of Caelius Secundus Curio.\n\nThe demand for Strasbourg faculty and pastors to commit themselves to the Augsburg Confession created difficulties for him. He had previously declined offers to move to Geneva and Lausanne because he was committed to Strasbourg. However, he could not remain after the controversy with the Lutheran superintendent Johann Marbach. Zanchi had described the differences in the doctrine of the Eucharist between the Lutheran and Reformed as being relatively minor and also taught a strict Calvinist doctrine of predestination. After receiving many consultations from theologians outside of Strasbourg, the disputing parties were able to reach an agreement in constructing a formula of unity (The Strasbourg Consensus) signed by all the city's preachers and professors.\n\nWhen Calvin chided him for his equivocation, Zanchi went public with his views again causing the controversy to erupt anew. He consequently left from Strasbourg to become the pastor of the Italian Protestant congregation in the Graubünden in Chiavenna. In 1568 he received a call to the University of Heidelberg, where he took over the chair of Dogmatics formerly occupied by Zacharias Ursinus. Here he wrote important works which tend to bear either an apologetic or polemical character. His method of presentation is quite scholastic. After the Electorate of the Palatinate returned to Lutheranism during the reign of Elector Ludwig VI, Zanchi moved with many other Reformed professors to the Casmirianum, a Reformed academy in Neustadt in the dominions of Count Palatine Johann Casimir. He died during a return visit to Heidelberg and was buried in the University Church.\n\nZanchius was a voluminous writer whose works include \"Confession of the Christian Religion\" and \"Observation on the Divine Attributes\". His \"The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination\" is still in publication today. His \"Operum theologicorum\" has also been extremely influential. One chapter from this work has been called \"the Protestant equivalent of Aquinas's \"Treatise on Law\",\" and has recently been translated into English and published as \"On the Law in General\" (2012). In this work, Zanchius repeatedly references natural law, arguing that its authority is equal to that of the Decalogue: \"Because the Decalogue defines and describes the same things that are called natural law, the Ten Commandments themselves are often called 'natural law.'. . . It must be mentioned that just as Christ is the fulfillment of the entire Mosaic law, so, too, is he the fulfillment of natural law because, as human beings are convicted of sin through the law, they flee to Christ for forgiveness.\" While his debt to Aquinas is evident throughout the \"Operum theologicorum\", he parts with Aquinas's conception of natural law due to disagreement in interpreting Romans 2:14-15. Zanchi argues that natural law should be seen as moral knowledge that God has universally and directly “reinscribed” on the human mind after the Fall, rather than as a \"relic of the original image of God” or some “essential part of human nature.\" \n\nThe following is a translation of the inscription on the headstone of Zanchius' grave:\n<poem>Here Zanchius rests, whom love of truth constrained\nto quit his own and seek a foreign land.\nHow good and great he was, how formed to shine,\nHow fraught with science human and divine;\nSufficient proof his numerous writings give,\nAnd those who heard him teach and saw him live.\nEarth still enjoys him, though his soul has fled:\nHis name is deathless, though his dust is dead.</poem>\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187058", "title": "Covenant (law)", "text": "Covenant (law)\n\nA covenant, in its most general sense and historical sense, is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action. Under historical English common law a covenant was distinguished from an ordinary contract by the presence of a seal. Because the presence of a seal indicated an unusual solemnity in the promises made in a covenant, the common law would enforce a covenant even in the absence of consideration. In United States contract law, an implied \"covenant\" of good faith is presumed.\n\nA covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a contractual condition. The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to perform (affirmative covenant (US) / positive covenant (E&W)) or to refrain from (negative covenant) some action. In real property law, the juristic term real covenants means conditions tied to the ownership or use of land. A \"covenant running with the land\", meeting tests of wording and circumstances laid down in precedent, imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; in the US the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real covenant law in the US has been referred to as an \"unspeakable quagmire\" by one court.\n\nCovenants for title are covenants which come with a deed or title to the property, in which the grantor of the title makes certain guarantees to the grantee. Non-compete clauses in the United States are also called restrictive covenants.\n\nLandlords may seek and courts may grant forfeiture of leases such as in leasehold estates for breach of covenant, which in most jurisdictions must be relatively severe breaches; however, the covenant to pay rent is one of the more fundamental covenants. The forfeiture of a private home involves interference with social and economic human rights. In the case of leases commuted to a large sum payable at the outset (a premium), this has prompted lobbying for and government measures of leasehold reform particularly in the law of ground rents and service charges.\nIn property law, land-related covenants are called \"real covenants\" and are a major form of covenant, typically imposing restrictions on how the land may be used (negative covenants) or requiring a certain continuing action (affirmative covenant). These may also \"run with the land\" (called a \"covenant appurtenant\"), meaning that any future owners of the land must abide by the terms, or may apply to a particular person (called a \"covenant in gross\" or \"of a purely personal nature\"). Under English law, affirmative covenants typically do not run with the land; in the United States such covenants are examined more closely, but with exceptions affirmative covenants have been permitted to run with the land.\n\nThe covenant may be shown in the deed and should be disclosed to prospective purchasers; it may also be recorded, or in the case of Commonwealth countries shown in Torrens title. Real covenants and easements or equitable servitudes are similar and in 1986, a symposium discussed whether the law of easements, equitable servitudes, and real covenants should be unified. As time passes and the original promisee of the covenant is no longer involved in the land, enforcement may become lax.\n\nCovenants may be imposed through homeowner associations, and controversy has arisen over selective enforcement. Historically, particularly in the United States, exclusionary covenants were used to exclude racial minorities. Some covenants exist for safety purposes, such as a covenant forbidding the construction of tall buildings in the vicinity of an airport or one restricting the height of fences/shrubs at street corners (so as not to interfere with drivers' sight lines). Covenants may restrict everything from the height and size of buildings to the materials used in construction to superficial matters such as paint color and holiday decorations. In residential areas, covenants may forbid \"dirty\" businesses (such as feedlots or chemical production facilities) or business use entirely, or modifications such as amateur radio antenna. Amateur radio restrictions have been particularly controversial; in 1985 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission issued PRB-1 preempting state and local restrictions, but not private restrictions; in 2012 after Congress passed a law requiring study of this issue (at the urging of amateur radio group ARRL), the FCC declined to extend this preemption. Some US states have enacted legislation requiring homeowners' associations to provide reasonable accommodations for amateur radio antennas under the rationale that amateur radio provides public service communications in the event of an emergency, major disaster, or special event.\n\nIn Canada, governmental authorities may use restrictive covenants as well as zoning. For instance, the city of Calgary's requirement that buildings in the general vicinity of Calgary International Airport be under a certain height is registered against virtually every title in the northeast quadrant of the city as a restrictive covenant, not as a zoning by-law.\n\nThe covenant will typically be written in the deed, and must be in writing due to the statute of frauds. Although scholars have argued that some of the following should be significantly relaxed, in order for the burden to run with the land the following must apply:\n\nCourts interpret covenants relatively strictly and give the words of the agreement their ordinary meaning. Generally if there is any unclear or ambiguous language regarding the existence of a covenant courts will favor free alienation of the property. Courts will not read any restrictions on the land by implication (as is done with easements for example). A covenant can be terminated if the original purpose of the covenant is lost. In some cases property owners can petition a court to remove or modify the covenants, and homeowner associations may include procedures for removing the covenants.\n\nThe covenant may be negative or affirmative. A negative covenant is one in which property owners are unable to perform a specific activity, such as block a scenic view. An affirmative covenant is one in which property owners must actively perform a specific activity, such as keeping the lawn tidy or paying homeowner's association dues for the upkeep of the surrounding area.\n\nAn agreement not to open a competing business on adjacent property is generally enforceable as a covenant running with the land. However, under the federal Supreme Court's holding in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\", 334 U.S. 1 (1948), a covenant that restricts sale to a minority person (commonly used during the Jim Crow era) is unenforceable, as enforcement would require the court to act in a racially discriminatory manner, contrary to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAt common law, the benefit of a restrictive covenant runs with the land if three conditions are met:\n\nAt common law, the burden of a restrictive covenant does not run except where strict privity of estate (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists.\n\nThe burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In \"Halsall v Brizell\" [1957] Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the successor in title to the original covenantor because he had elected to take the benefit. The rule in \"Halsall v Brizell\" is limited to cases where the benefit can be linked to a specific burden and where the covenantor's successors in title can physically elect to take the benefit. For example, a restrictive covenant to contribute to the maintenance costs of a common area will not be binding if the covenantor's successors in title have no legal right to use them.\n\nA positive burden can run in law, but not in equity, as it is deemed to be analogous to a contract, to which equitable principles do not apply (\"Rhone v Stephens\" (1994)).\n\nThe burden of a restrictive covenant will run in equity if these prerequisites are met:\n\nThe leading case of restrictive covenants in equity is generally regarded as that of Tulk v Moxhay in which it was determined that the burden could run in equity subject to the qualifications listed above.\n\nIn contemporary practice in the United States, a covenant typically refers to restrictions set on contracts like deeds of sale. \"Covenants, conditions, and restrictions,\" commonly abbreviated \"CC&Rs\" or \"CCRs\", are a complicated system of covenants, known generically as \"deed restrictions,\" built into the deeds of all the lots in a common interest development, particularly in the tens of millions of American homes governed by a homeowner association (HOA) or condominium association. There are some office or industrial parks subject to CCRs as well.\n\nThese CCRs might, for example, dictate the types of structures that can be built (e.g. a CCR may prohibit any type of modular, prefabricated, or mobile home, and/or may require the structure to be a minimum size), appearance (e.g. no junk cars), or other uses (e.g. no operation of home-based business, no pets except traditional household animals). The purpose of this is to maintain a neighborhood character or prevent improper use of the land. Many covenants of this nature were imposed in the United States in the 1920s through the 1940s, before zoning became widespread. However, many modern developments are also restricted by covenants on property titles; this is often justified as a means of preserving the values of the houses in the area. Covenant restrictions can be removed through court action, although this process is lengthy and often very expensive. In some cases it even involves a plebiscite of nearby property owners. Although control of such planning issues is often governed by local planning schemes or other regulatory frameworks rather than through the use of covenants, there are still many covenants imposed, particularly in states that limit the level of control over real property use that may be exercised by local governments.\n\n Covenants often exclude certain classes based on race, religion or ethnicity. These groups are generally marginalized groups\n\nIn the United States deed restrictions and restrictive covenants became an important instrument for enforcing racial segregation in many towns and cities beginning in the 1920s. Often the restrictions applied only to African Americans wishing to buy property or rent a house or apartment. But other populations might also be banned. A restrictive covenant covering a large neighborhood in Seattle declared that \"no part of said property hereby conveyed shall ever be used or occupied by any Hebrew or by any person of the Ethiopian, Malay or any Asiatic Race\", thus banning Jews and anyone of African, Filipino, or Asian ancestry. The exclusionary language varied widely. Some neighborhoods were reserved for the \"White or Caucasian race\". Others enumerated banned populations. One subdivision near Seattle specified that \"This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race.\" Before 1948, these covenants were legally used for segregationist purposes. In the 1920s and 1930s, covenants that restricted the sale or occupation of real property on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, or social class were common in the United States, where the primary intent was to keep \"white\" neighbourhoods \"white\". Such covenants were employed by many real estate developers to \"protect\" entire subdivisions. The purpose of an exclusionary covenant was to prohibit a buyer of property from reselling, leasing, or transferring the property to members of a given race, ethnic origin, and/or religion as specified in the title deed. Some covenants, such as those tied to properties in Forest Hills Gardens, New York, also sought to exclude working class people; however this type of social segregation was more commonly achieved through the use of high property prices, minimum cost requirements, and application reference checks. In practice, exclusionary covenants were most typically concerned with keeping out African Americans; however, restrictions against Asian-Americans, Jews, and Catholics were not uncommon. For example, the Lake Shore Club District, in Pennsylvania, sought to exclude various minorities, including Negros, Mongolians, Hungarians, Mexicans, Greeks, and various other European ethnicities. Cities known for their widespread use of racial covenants include Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Seattle, and St. Louis.\n\n90% of the housing projects built in the years following World War II were racially restricted by such covenants.\n\nRacial covenants emerged during the mid-19th century and started to gain prominence from the 1890s onwards. It was not until the 1920s that they adopted widespread national significance, a situation that continued until the 1940s. Racial covenants were an alternative to racially restrictive zoning ordinances (residential segregation based on race) that the 1917 US Supreme Court ruling of \"Buchanan v. Warley\" invalidated on constitutional grounds. \n\nDuring the 1920s, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) sponsored several unsuccessful legal challenges against racial covenants. In a blow to campaigners against racial segregation, the legality of racial restrictive covenants was affirmed by the landmark \"Corrigan v. Buckley\" judgment that ruled that such clauses constituted \"private action\" and as such were not subject to the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of this decision, racial restrictive covenants proliferated across the US during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nEven the invalidation of such a covenant by the US Supreme Court in the 1940 case of \"Hansberry v. Lee\" did little to reverse the trend, because the ruling was based on a technicality and failed to set a legal precedent. It was not until 1948 that the \"Shelley v. Kraemer\" judgment overturned the \"Corrigan v. Buckley\" decision, stating that exclusionary covenants were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and were therefore legally unenforceable.\n\nSome commentators have attributed the popularity of exclusionary covenants at this time as a response to the urbanization of black Americans following World War I, and the fear of \"black invasion\" into white neighborhoods, which residents felt would result in depressed property prices, increased nuisance (crime), and social instability. Many African Americans openly defied these covenants and attempted to \"pioneer\" restricted areas.\n\nIn 1968, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) which outlawed housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1988, it was expanded to prohibit discrimination based on familial status (e.g. the presence of children) or disability.\n\nAlthough exclusionary covenants are not enforceable today, they still exist in many original property deeds as \"underlying documents\", and title insurance policies often contain exclusions preventing coverage of such restrictions. Since 2010, the Seattle Civil Rights & Labor History Project has located more than 500 restrictive covenants and deeds covering more than 20,000 properties in Seattle and its suburbs. In response, the Washington State legislature passed a law that since January 1, 2019 allows property owners to \"modify\" property records, disavowing the offensive restriction.\n\n\nAlthough most commonly associated with the United States, racially or ethnically restrictive covenants have been used in other countries:\n\nTitle covenants serve as guarantees to the recipient of property, ensuring that the recipient receives what he or she bargained for.\n\nOutside of England and Wales the English covenants of title, sometimes included in deeds to real property, are (1) that the grantor is lawfully seized (in fee simple) of the property, (2) that the grantor has the right to convey the property to the grantee, (3) that the property is conveyed without encumbrances (this covenant is frequently modified to allow for certain encumbrances), (4) that the grantor has done no act to encumber the property, (5) that the grantee shall have quiet possession of the property, and (6) that the grantor will execute such further assurances of the land as may be requisite (Nos. 3 and 4, which overlap significantly, are sometimes treated as one item). The English covenants may be described individually, or they may be incorporated by reference, as in a deed granting property \"with general warranty and English covenants of title...\n\nSince 1989 the main covenants implied in England and Wales, on \"limited\" or \"full title guarantee\" are, (unless expressly overridden):\n\n\nOthers as to charges, incumbrances, and third-party rights vary depending on whether full or limited title guarantee is agreed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187078", "title": "NRA Precision Pistol", "text": "NRA Precision Pistol\n\nNRA Precision Pistol, formerly known as NRA Conventional Pistol, is a national bullseye shooting discipline organized in the United States by NRA. Emphasis is on accuracy and precision, and participants shoot handguns at paper targets at fixed distances and time limits. Other organizations in the United States and Canada have established rules and keep records of similar disciplines, including the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) in the United States, . \n\nBullseye pistol was the inspiration for the ISSF international 25 m Standard Pistol (82 feet) event and like the ISSF pistol events, the development of skills required to shoot one-handed at and bullseye targets at , respectively, takes considerable training to achieve proficiency.\n\nAll courses of fire are from a standing position using a one-handed grip at two different targets depending on the distance and type of match. The slow-fire targets have the 8–10 rings inside the bullseye and the rapid fire targets have only the 9, 10 and X rings inside the black.\n\nDepending on the match format, the competitor may be required to shoot as many as 90 rounds using as many as three different handguns. Each shot scores a maximum of 10 points. Hence, a one-gun competition is often referred to as a \"900\" whereas a three-gun competition is a \"2700\". A shorter form is the National Match Course consisting of a single Slow Fire, a Timed and a Rapid Fire target, 30 shots for a maximum score of 300. Single gun competitions using only the rimfire pistol are common, as they provide an inexpensive entry into the sport.\n\nOutdoor competitions are typically fired at for slow fire courses and for timed and rapid fire courses. A \"short course\" shoots only at 25 yards and uses a reduced-size target for the Slow Fire segment. All courses of fire at an indoor competition are typically fired at with appropriately scaled targets. A notable exception to this rule of thumb happens at the Oak Harbor (Ohio) Conservation Club at 50/25 yards and Amarillo (Texas) Rifle Pistol Club at 25 yards which conducts indoor matches monthly through the fall, winter and spring.\n\nAn example outdoor 900 match would include:\n\n\nBullseye specifies three classes of pistol; a .22 caliber rimfire, a centerfire handgun of .32 caliber or greater; and a .45 caliber pistol. Since the format includes a sustained fire stage, a semi-automatic pistol or revolver with a capacity of at least 5 rounds is needed.\n\nWhile most moderately priced rimfire pistols are suitable for bullseye competition (the Ruger MK II or Ruger MK III being a common starting gun) the Smith & Wesson Model 41, 1911 22LR conversions, and the Hämmerli 208 dominate the top levels of rimfire competition.\n\nThe most common centerfire pistol is the M1911 design, usually built and accurized by a gunsmith. While many shooters use the M1911 for the centerfire stages of competition, some shooters prefer a third gun. European models such as .32 S&W automatics from Walther, the now discontinued Smith & Wesson Model 52, and others are common, as are M1911 variants in smaller calibers, such as .32 ACP, 380ACP, .38 Special, 9mm, or .38 Super. One advantage of .45 caliber over .38 caliber is that the larger diameter hole made will be able cut a higher scoring ring over the smaller caliber given the same point of impact near the higher ring.\n\nSmith & Wesson revolvers are most common among shooters who prefer revolvers; S&W makes revolvers in .22 Long Rifle, .38 Special, and .45 ACP. Custom gunsmithing is common here as well to increase reliability and usability all leading to improved accuracy.\n\nAny type of sight can be used, except laser sights. Many competitors use iron sights, but the recent trend has been towards red dot sights, which many shooters find easier to use. Telescopic sights, while legal, are rare, as magnification is not considered an advantage. Iron sights are usually adjustable Patridge type sights, carefully treated to reduce glare that might impact sight alignment.\n\nFor the rimfire pistol, shooters use high quality target grade ammunition, ideally purchased in bulk so all ammunition comes from the same manufacturing lot, since even minor changes can result in changing point of impact. Relatively low velocity ammunition (always below the speed of sound) is preferred for precision Bullseye target shooting in both the slow and sustained fire disciplines because the .22 bullet can travel at or near the speed of sound. If a bullet transitions between supersonic speed and subsonic speed before striking the target, its flight path is slightly disturbed, reducing precision. To avoid this phenomenon, strictly subsonic ammunition is preferred.\n\nCenterfire ammunition is often handloaded, with very careful selection of components so maximum precision can be obtained. Lighter weight bullets and lower velocities are often selected to minimize recoil and improve precision. For any given handgun or rifle there is an optimum combination that delivers the peak or maximum possible accuracy.\n\nThe annual National Rifle and Pistol Matches take place at Camp Perry, Ohio in July and August. Competing shooters are registered with the National Rifle Association and scores are officially recorded. Registered matches (Regional, Sectional, and State championships and local matches) are held at various locations throughout the year and are often sponsored by local shooting clubs. Authorized matches are also recognized by the NRA. Scores at all of these competitions are recorded by the NRA and used to rank a shooter's abilities.\n\nWhile perfect scores have been shot in individual stages, no shooter has ever scored a 2700 in a sanctioned match. The current record is 2680-159x, set on July 24, 1974, by Hershel Anderson, with 159 of 270 shots hitting the \"X\" ring.\n\nFormer US Marine Brian Zins holds the record of most NRA championships with 12, as of 2013.\n\n\n"}

The \"Nymphaea lotus\" var. \"thermalis\" is a tertiary relict variety, endemic to the thermal waters of Europe, for example the Peţa River in Romania or the Hévíz lake in Hungary .\n\nIt was introduced into western cultivation in 1802 by Loddiges Nursery. Eduard Ortgies crossed \"Nymphaea lotus\" (\"N. dentata\") with \"Nymphaea pubescens\" (\"N. rubra\") to produce the first \"Nymphaea\" hybrid, illustrated in \"Flore des serres\" 8 t. 775, 776 under the name \"Nymphaea ortgiesiano-rubra\". It is a popular ornamental aquatic plant in Venezuela.\n\nThis species of water lily has lily pads which float on the water, and blossoms which rise above the water.\n\nIt is a perennial, grows to 45 cm in height. The color of the flower is white and sometimes tinged with pink.\n\nIt is found in ponds, and prefers clear, warm, still and slightly acidic waters. It can be found in association with other aquatic plant species such as \"Utricularia stellaris\"\n\n\"Nymphaea lotus\" is often used as a freshwater aquarium plant. In ornamental garden pools and in greenhouse culture it is grown for its flowers, which do not normally appear under aquarium conditions: aquarists prefer to trim the floating lily pads, and just maintain the underwater foliage. Strong light is required for deep reddish color in the \"red\" forms.\n\nThe tiger-like variegations appear under intense illumination.\n\nIn ancient times the Egyptian lotus was worshipped, especially in Egypt. It was considered a symbol of creation there. In Ancient Greece, it was a symbol of innocence and modesty.\n\nThe Egyptian lotus is the national flower of Egypt. It is also an element of the Coptic flag.\n\nClaire Waight Keller included the flower to represent Malawi in Meghan Markle's wedding veil, which included the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country.\nIn some parts of Africa the rhizomes and tubers are eaten for the starch they contain either boiled, roasted or ground to a flour after drying. The young fruits are sometimes consumed as a salad. The seeds are turned into a meal.\n\nThe tubers or the seeds are used as a famine food in India.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians cultivated the white lotus in ponds and marshes.\n\nThis flower often appears in ancient Egyptian decorations. They believed that the lotus flower gave them strength and power; remains of the flower have been found in the burial tomb of Ramesses II. Egyptian tomb paintings from around 1500 BC provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental horticulture and landscape design; they depict lotus ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of acacias and palms. In Egyptian mythology Horus was occasionally shown in art as a naked boy with a finger in his mouth sitting on a lotus with his mother. The lotus was one of the two earliest Egyptian capitals motifs, the topmost members of a column. At that time, the motifs of importance are those based on the lotus and papyrus plants respectively, and these, with the palm tree capital, were the chief types employed by the Egyptians, until under the Ptolemies in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, various other river plants were also employed, and the conventional lotus capital went through various modifications. Women often wore amulets during childbirth, which depicted Heqet as a frog, sitting in a lotus.\n\nThe number 1,000 in ancient Egyptian numerals is represented by the symbol of the white lotus. The related hieroglyph is: M12\n\nThe ancient Egyptians also extracted perfume from this flower. They also used the white lotus in funerary garlands, temple offerings and female adornment.\n\nThe white lotus is a candidate for the plant eaten by the Lotophagi of Homer's Odyssey.\n\nThough the plant contains a quinolizidine alkaloid, nupharin, and related chemicals, either described according to sources as poisonous, intoxicating or without effects, it seems to have been consumed since Antiquity. The effects of the alkaloids would be those of a psychedelic aphrodisiac, though these effects are more those encountered in \"Nymphaea caerulea\", the blue Egyptian water lily.\n\nThe chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of the leaf shows the presence of phenolic compounds (flavonoids, coumarins and tannins), sterols and alkaloids.\n\nOther compounds include myricitrin, myricetin 3-(6\"-p-coumaroylglucoside), myricetin-3'-O-(6\"-p-coumaroyl)glucoside and two epimeric macrocyclic derivatives, nympholide A and B, myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside and penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose.\n"}

His father, Aristide Sigismondi, immigrated to the United States from Abruzzi, Italy, in 1904 at the age of 21, and became a comedian in Italian language theater, with a radio program of his own. His mother, Agata \"Kate\" Sigismondi, was born in Messina, Sicily, and was 15 years younger than Aristide.\n\nAt the age of nine, Aldo got his first chance to perform publicly when his father was running short on his program and called on Aldo to sing. Though Aldo fainted immediately upon completing his song, he was good enough that he became a regular on his father's program.\n\nDale's intention was originally not to be a singer, but to go into journalism. However, he quit school after an argument with a teacher and ended up going from one job to another, until one day in 1943 he and a friend passed by a casino in Coney Island and the friend suggested he try out for a singing job. He was told to come back in the evening, and when he came back prepared to sing two songs, was called back for seven encores. He was immediately hired. In 1944, he joined the Carmen Cavallaro Orchestra as featured vocalist, and at Cavallaro's insistence got a new name. The name was taken from Alan-a-Dale. In 1944 and 1945, Dale sang for George Paxton's Orchestra and became increasingly popular on the East Coast performing at the Roseland Ballroom in New York and recording for Majestic Records.\n\nIn 1947 he was encouraged by Bob Thiele, a record producer, to sign up as a solo artist with Signature Records. He premiered as a soloist on Columbia records in a December 1947 film short featuring the Elliot Lawrence Orchestra. The next year he got his own television show, \"The Alan Dale Show\", on the DuMont Television Network. In 1950, it went to CBS.\n\nIn the early 1950s, he shuttled around from one record label to another, going from Columbia to Decca before settling with Coral, the label on which he had his major hits: \"(The Gang that Sang) Heart of My Heart\" (together with Johnny Desmond and Don Cornell), which reached #10 on \"Billboard\" in 1953, a vocal version of \"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White\" which reached #14 in 1955, and \"Sweet and Gentle,\" which also charted in 1955, at #10. The latter two recordings sold over one million copies each, and were awarded gold discs.\n\nAlso in 1955. the singles \"I'm Sincere\" (the flip of \"Cherry Pink\") and \"Rockin The Cha-Cha\" reached the Music Vendor top 40.\n\nHe became a friend of Alan Freed, and as a result got a chance to play a role as a rock and roll singer in the 1956 film, \"Don't Knock the Rock.\" In this movie, he played alongside Freed, Bill Haley & His Comets, Little Richard, and The Treniers.

In 1958, while in a nightclub in New York, Dale was attacked, suffering cuts and a serious hand injury when he crashed into a plate glass window after having fallen down a set of stairs. Dale recovered from his injuries, but the assailant who knocked him down the stairs was never identified.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, Dale found television hosts such as Ed Sullivan were refusing to have him on their shows, causing his career to go into decline. This was not helped by his authorship of a 1965 autobiography, \"The Spider and the Marionettes,\" in which he listed names of people who were trying to affect his career adversely, with descriptions of their activities toward this end. Despite this, Dale was able to maintain a lower-profile version of his singing career over the ensuing decades, performing at nightclubs, dinner theaters and concert appearances.\n\nHe died in New York in 2002, at the age of 76.\n\n"}

It may be related to the expression \"salt and light\", which was then used to describe the Law. This verse is unparalleled elsewhere in the New Testament, but a version of it is found in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas. In Thomas the focus of the verse is on the city's security and impregnability rather than its symbolism. Gundry notes that at this time cities would frequently have been located on hills for defensive reasons. Schweizer notes that this might be a reference to Mount Zion at the start of Isaiah 2. Scholars are divided on whether this is a specific reference to the idea of a New Jerusalem. Albright and Mann note that Cicero described Rome as light to the world, but that it is unlikely that this verse borrows from him.

It is an affiliate of National Public Radio, Public Radio International and American Public Media. It operates 19 radio stations and 13 translators across Washington State, Oregon, and Idaho, and provides coverage to parts of British Columbia. The network broadcasts public radio news, talk, entertainment, classical music, jazz, and folk music. Station programming is separated into two main program streams, \"NPR News\" and \"NPR & Classical Music\", with simulcast periods during \"Morning Edition\", \"All Things Considered\", and \"Weekend Edition\". Since November 2013, Northwest Public Radio also operates a 24-hour jazz station, KJEM 89.9, broadcasting in the Pullman and Moscow area.\n\nNWPR headquarters are in the Murrow Communications Center on the WSU campus, with satellite studios at WSU Tri-Cities' campus in Richland, the UI campus in Moscow, Idaho and studio offices in Tacoma and Wenatchee.\n\nWSU has a long history in broadcasting, dating to 1908 when it was known as Washington State College. NWPR's flagship station, KWSU 1250 in Pullman signed on December 10, 1922 as KFAE and became KWSC (for Washington State College) in 1925. For many years, it served a large portion of the Pacific Northwest. It became KWSU on March 1, 1969, ten years after Washington State attained university status. Edward R. Murrow began his career at the station, as did Keith Jackson and Barry Serafin. KWSU was a charter member of NPR, and was one of the 90 stations that carried the inaugural broadcast of \"All Things Considered\" in 1971.\n\nIn 1982, KFAE-FM 89.1 at Richland signed on, bringing public radio to the Tri-Cities for the first time. The next year, WSU activated a series of low-powered translators at Ellensburg, Goldendale/The Dalles, Yakima, Lewiston/Clarkston, Ephrata/Soap Lake, Wenatchee, Cashmere/Dryden, and Chelan/Waterville. In 1984, after budget cuts in Idaho, WSU assumed operation of KUID-FM 91.7 at the University of Idaho and renamed it KRFA-FM; this gave it its first FM service in the Pullman area and resulted in the new outlet assuming many of the classical programs on KWSU.\n\nThe launch of KNWR, a full-power transmitter at Ellensburg, in 1992 heralded the beginning of two decades of expansion. KNWY in the Yakima Valley went on air in 1993. In 1994, KNWO in Cottonwood, Idaho, was added; additionally, three new translators were commissioned and KRFA increased its power tenfold. KNWV went on air in Lewiston and Clarkston in 1995. 1997 brought KWWS in Walla Walla, and after a $500,000 donation from the estate of Ephrata rancher Paul Lauzier, KLWS at Moses Lake. Port Angeles—and Victoria, British Columbia—were added with the signing on of KNWP in 1998. KQWS at Omak began broadcasting in January 1999; the next year, a translator of KWSU was added in Pullman, giving the station its first FM presence. A translator at Forks was added in 2006. KSWS at Chehalis was built in 2010.\n\nIn several cases, the university acquired or began broadcasting over preexisting public radio stations. On January 6, 1997, Northern Sound Public Radio's KZAZ-FM in Bellingham, was merged into the network as its first station west of the Cascades. The license for KMWS at Mount Vernon was acquired from Skagit Valley College, which moved its KSVR to a new license; the university chose the call letters to honor Murrow, a Skagit County native. In 2010, KVTI in Tacoma, owned by Clover Park Technical College, began broadcasting Northwest Public Radio full-time after budget cuts prompted the closure of its radio broadcasting program. In 2012, the Yakima School District's KYVT began broadcasting NWPR's NPR News programming under an agreement in which the network provided the district's skills center and an HD2 subchannel for its student programming in exchange for studio space and a primary frequency for the news service, which had not been previously available in Yakima.\n\nWith one exception, NWPR's transmitters are structured into two services: an NPR news/talk service and a service combining NPR programming and classical music.\n\nKFAE-FM also broadcast the Washington Talking Book and Braille Library's Evergreen Radio Reading Service to blind and handicapped listeners on its 67kHz subcarrier until the service's closure on August 15, 2014. KFAE-FM was one of three major FM stations in Washington to do so; KPBX-FM in Spokane and KUOW-FM in Seattle were the others. However, this required a special FM radio capable of receiving such broadcasts; it could not be received on a standard FM radio.\n\nOn November 1, 2013, WSU launched a third station in Pullman: KJEM (89.9 FM), broadcasting jazz music 24 hours a day to the Pullman and Moscow area and named for J. Elroy McCaw. Unlike the rest of the network, KJEM is largely student-run.\n\n\n"}

From 1977 to 1989, he owned Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), a wrestling company affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). From 1976 to 1987, he also owned the Charlotte Orioles, a minor league baseball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Crockett owned the Winston-Salem Polar Twins in the Southern Hockey League from 1975 to 1977.\n\nBorn to Jim Crockett and Elizabeth Crockett in Charlotte, Jim Jr. graduated from Myers Park High School in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1960. He and his younger siblings (David, Jackie, and Frances) were largely uninvolved in professional wrestling until their father's death in 1973. The elder Crockett had been a promoter of wrestling and other forms of entertainment since 1931 (with JCP joining the NWA in 1950).\n\nAlthough Jim Crockett Sr. had decided his son-in-law John Ringley would run JCP, Jim Jr. reluctantly took over ownership of the company that same year. Crockett brought in wrestler George Scott as head booker, and he signed wrestlers from across the country, from veterans such as Wahoo McDaniel to younger wrestlers like Ric Flair.\n\nIn 1980, Crockett was elected to his first term as NWA President, which ended in 1982. He had a working relationship with Maple Leaf Wrestling, based out of Toronto and owned by Frank Tunney, until Tunney's death in 1983. Tunney's nephew Jack Tunney switched Maple Leaf Wrestling's working agreement to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Crockett then formed a short-lived relationship with Verne Gagne and his American Wrestling Association (AWA) to form Pro Wrestling USA.\n\nCrockett was elected to a second term as NWA President in 1985. He bought Vince McMahon's Saturday night TV time slot on Superstation WTBS and his business began to flourish. During that year, he organized the first annual Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup, in which wrestlers from eight NWA regional territories participated in a day-long tag team tournament at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The Road Warriors defeated Ron Garvin & Magnum T.A. after 7½ hours to win the tournament. Although Crockett had organized the tournament as a tribute to his father, several rival promoters suspected he was using the event to further his own plans for expanding his promotion nationally.\n\nTheir suspicions increased as Crockett began holding wrestling events in Memphis and Florida without contacting the local NWA promoters. He eventually purchased promotions based in Oklahoma and Kansas City in the Mid-South territory and began airing his own televised wrestling events, which were syndicated across the United States.\n\nCrockett was elected to a third term as NWA President in 1987. That same year he bought out Championship Wrestling from Florida and the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), thus acquiring such talent as wrestler Sting and commentator Jim Ross. Although initially planning to keep the UWF and NWA as separate promotions in order to promote an annual inter-promotional event similar to the Super Bowl, Crockett instead moved the old UWF headquarters from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Dallas, Texas. and incorporated its stars into his own promotion.\n\nCrockett promoted his company, JCP, as the NWA, since he owned six NWA territories and was the NWA President, much to the confusion of fans.\n\nBy November 1988, Crockett was near bankruptcy and, through promoter Jim Barnett, sold his company to Ted Turner, who renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Crockett remained NWA President until 1991.\n\nCrockett attempted a return to wrestling with a wrestling Internet broadcast network in 1994 called the World Wrestling Network. It was short-lived, and he left the sport for good in 1995. Crockett also brought the NWA back to the Dallas Sportatorium for an equally brief tenure during this time.\n\nSince his retirement from professional wrestling promoting, Crockett has worked as a Texas realtor and mortgage loan originator.\n\n"}

The keyboard was made of layers of conductive (membrane) material and followed the Sinclair pattern. The video output was sent via a RF modulator to a TV set tuned at VHF channel 3, and it featured black characters on a white background. The maximum resolution was 64 x 44 pixels black and white, for graphic plotting. There were some special characters (shade patterns) useful for games and basic images.\n\nThe TK82C included the SLOW function which permitted the video be shown during the processing (the prior version, TK82, a Sinclair ZX80 clone, ran only in fast mode, so the image was not shown during its processing). In reality, the SLOW function was done by an add-on board that was factory-mounted over the main board.\n\nAlthough being a ZX81 clone, the TK82C did not have the ULA chip from Ferranti, used in the former. Instead it was manufactured with a dozen of TTL integrated circuits, which resulted in a somewhat large power consumption. This could be noted as the computer's case used to become quite hot after some minutes of operation.\n\nData storage was done in audio cassette tapes at 300 bits per second, and large programs could take up to 6 minutes to load.\n\nAudio cables were supplied with the computer for connection with a regular tape recorder.\n\nAs the data encoding was entirely done by software, some hacks were made available to allow much faster transfers. Hi-fi recorders were required in order to use the greater speeds with a minimum of reliability.\n\n\nAll software designed to the ZX81 could run in the TK82C with no problems, and vice versa. So it was not uncommon to find software distributed in Brazil, that were nothing more than illegitimate copies of products for the ZX81. However, given the TK82's popularity, a great deal of original software was developed in Brazil as well.\n\nIn 1983, Sinclair Research sued Microdigital over copyright violation because of the unauthorized cloning of its product. Due to political trends from that time, the Brazilian court in charge of the case sided with Microdigital.\n\nThe TK82C (the C letter stands for \"Científico\", or Scientific in English) was replaced by the TK83 (it used a ULA similar chip, as the original ZX81) and by the TK85 (a 16 KB RAM version with a case similar to ZX-Spectrum), more robust and with a better design.\n\nMicrodigital later produced the TK90X and TK95, which were clones of the ZX Spectrum.\n\nTK82C is also a designation for a copier from Kyocera.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187126", "title": "Incentive stock option", "text": "Incentive stock option\n\nIncentive stock options (ISOs), are a type of employee stock option that can be granted only to employees and confer a U.S. tax benefit. ISOs are also sometimes referred to as statutory stock options by the IRS. ISOs have a strike price, which is the price a holder must pay to purchase one share of the stock. ISOs may be issued both by public companies and private companies, with ISOs being common as a form of executive compensation for public companies, and common as a form of equity compensation in private start-up companies.\n\nThe tax benefit is that on exercise, the individual does not pay ordinary income tax nor employment taxes on the difference between the exercise price and the strike price of the shares issued (but may owe a substantial alternative minimum tax if the shares are not sold in the same year, especially if the difference between exercise price and strike price is large, on the order of $50,000 or more). Rather, if the shares are held for 1 year from the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of grant (a \"qualifying disposition\"), then the profit made above the strike price is taxed entirely as a long-term capital gain, at a maximum rate of 23.8% as opposed to 37%.\n\nTax treatment for the incentive stock option was created by the Revenue Act of 1950. In the following decade, stock option grants became popular as a form of compensation, primarily for executives. The introduction of restricted shares and performance shares in the 1960s and 1970s diminished its popularity, but stock options continued to dominate through the 1960s, 1980s, and 1990s. \n\nIn October 2004, section 409(a) of the tax code was added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which set rules requiring the strike price of the option grant to be at least the fair market value, giving rise to the term 409(a) valuation.\n\nIn 2005, law professor Erik Lie published a report into the options backdating involving changing the strike price and date of an option after issue, which led to over 100 SEC and DOJ investigations, resulting in 12 criminal sentences.\n\nAs of 2014, stock options including ISOs are no longer the most common form of long-term equity incentive rewards for executives, with about half given as performance shares, a quarter as RSUs, and a quarter as stock options.\n\nIf the shares are sold before this required holding period (a \"disqualifying disposition\") in the same tax year, then the difference between the price at the time of exercise minus the strike price is taxed as ordinary income, and any additional gain on top of the exercise price is taxed as a short-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are subject to the same tax brackets as ordinary income but are also subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax. If the incentive stock option is sold above the strike price but below the exercise price in the same tax year, the income is recognized solely as ordinary income. If sold before the required 1-year holding period in a different tax year. Even if a disqualifying disposition is made, if the shares exercised are not sold in the same tax year, the holder must calculate to see if any alternative minimum tax is owed. \nAlthough ISOs have more favorable tax treatment than NSOs (non-qualified stock options or nonstatutory stock options), they require the holder to take on more risk by holding the stock for a longer period of time if the holder is to receive optimal tax treatment. However, even if the holder disposes of the stock within a year, it is possible that there will still be marginal tax deferral value (as compared to NQOs) if the holding period, though less than a year, straddles the ending of the taxpayer's taxable reporting period. Ordinary income from incentive stock options, unlike wage income or income from NSOs, is also not subject to payroll taxes such as FICA.\n\nNote further that an employer generally does not claim a corporate income tax deduction (which would be in an amount equal to the amount of income recognized by the employee) upon the exercise of its employee's ISO, unless the employee does not meet the holding-period requirements and sells early, making a disqualifying disposition. With NQSOs, on the other hand, the employer is always eligible to claim a deduction upon its employee's exercise of the NQSO.\n\nISOs must be exercised by an employee within 3 months of termination of employment or be forfeited. Since it may be difficult or impossible to sell shares on the secondary market, this would often either force employees to pay a substantial alternative minimum tax liability, or forfeit their earned shares. To solve this issue, some private companies allow the option to convert ISOs to NSOs, which allows the exercise period to be extended to up to 10 years. In March 2015, Pinterest announced that it was allowing employees who had worked with the company for at least two years to convert their ISOs to NSOs and be able to exercise those options for up to 7 years, spurring a wave of companies to follow suit.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created the 83(i) election for tax year 2018, which allows an employee of a company satisfying certain requirements to defer taxation upon exercise for up to 5 years. The 83(i) election provision and its requirements is very similar to the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act proposed by senators Mark Warner and Dean Heller in 2016.\n\nOn January 1, 2014, the employee of a private company receives a grant of 1,000 shares at a strike price of $1 vesting monthly over 4 years. Note that the strike price for an employee's ISO grant must be set to the current 409(a) fair market value of the common shares, which is generally lower than that of the preferred valuation of shares owned by venture capitalists that is quoted in news. At this point, the company may contain 9 million shares at a preferred price of $3, valuing the company as a whole at $27 million. At this point, the company can choose to offer the option of early exercise: where an employee can purchase the entire grant before vesting, and perform an 83(b) election and notify the IRS within 30 days with form 83(b). If the employee performs an early exercise and does not fully vest the shares, the exercise price for the unvested shares is returned. In this example, the employee does not early exercise.\nOn January 1, 2018, the company raises another round of funding as the company grows, issuing an additional 1 million shares at a preferred price of $300. The company performs another 409(a) valuation and values the common shares at $200 each. The valuation of the company as a whole is now $3 billion, making it a unicorn.\n\nOn February 1, 2018, the employee elects to exercise, or purchase, these vested shares. The employee has fully vested the shares, and must pay a price of $1 per share to purchase these ISOs. The employee pays $1,000 to exercise these shares. The current difference between the common share price, $200, and the strike price, $1, creates a bargain element of $199 per share or a total bargain element of $199,000. If not sold by the end of this year, this $199,000 bargain element along with the employee's ordinary income is taxable under AMT at a maximum rate of 28%, which is then imposed if it is higher than the ordinary tax. \n\nOn May 1, 2018, the company raises additional capital in an initial public offering, where the shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $400 per share.\n\nOn December 1, 2018, the employee sells 500 of the 1,000 shares at a price of $350 per share. These shares are now a disqualifying disposition because they were sold before a 1 year holding period. This sale generates ordinary income of $175,000.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, the remaining 500 exercised but not sold shares creates a bargain element of ($200-1)*500=$99,500 that may be taxed under the alternative minimum tax. For tax year 2018, a single taxpayer earning $100,000 with no special adjustments may incur about $40,000 of AMT preference items such as the bargain element of incentive stock option exercise and hold without paying AMT, due to the AMT exemption.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, the employee sells the remaining 500 shares at $300 per share. The employee now owes long term capital gains tax on 500*($300-1)=$149,500. If the taxpayer paid AMT in 2018, the taxpayer is may be entitled to recoup any AMT credit generated in tax year 2019.\n\nAdditionally, there are several other restrictions which have to be met (by the employer or employee) in order to qualify the compensatory stock option as an ISO. For a stock option to qualify as ISO and thus receive special tax treatment under Section 421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), it must meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code when granted and at all times beginning from the grant until its exercise.

Through Wahaha's extensive distribution network, Future Cola dominates rural China and its second- and third-line cities. Sales in 2003 amounted to 620 million litres, approximately 35% and 70% of the volumes of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola respectively.\n\nIn China, Wahaha adopted three main marketing techniques. First, its advertisements adopt a nationalistic tone. Copy promotes Future Cola as \"Chinese people’s own cola\" and incites consumers to select it over Coke or Pepsi. Future Cola’s focus on rural areas gave the product high penetration at lower costs. It also uses celebrity advertising. Its penetration pricing made it an affordable alternative to its rivals, particularly in the more price-sensitive rural areas.\n\nWahaha works with a trading and distribution company in Taiwan and completed a factory for its cola products in Indonesia. Cola has joined other Wahaha products to be exported to France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.\n\nIn 2003 Future Cola became the first mainland Chinese cola to enter America, selling through small convenience outlets in New York City and Los Angeles as 'China Cola'. Since then, China Cola has been sold and manufactured in the United States by Reed's, Inc but it boasts a low market share.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187133", "title": "Spectre M4", "text": "Spectre M4\n\nThe Spectre M4 is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by Gritti, until 2001. The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top-folding buttstocks, and were available with or without a forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely steel Spectre has a polymer overmolded grip, magazine release and safety/selector levers.\n\nThe Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian special forces, and has been exported elsewhere.\n\nThe Spectre is a striker-fired blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt. The trigger group is double-action with a decocker. When the decocker is activated the striker is dropped while a small flap that contacts the firing pin is retracted. When the trigger is pulled in the double-action-like mode, the striker is retracted then dropped, firing the gun. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately as the double-action trigger eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting. A manual safety is provided. Unconventional 50-round and 30-round capacity, four-column magazines are provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional two-column magazines.\n\nVersions of the SITES \"Spectre\" M4 submachine gun specifically made for the civilian market have been around since the middle 1980s and up to the late 1990s, their production suffering a major backlash when the US Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited the import and sale of them on the American market, the biggest and most lucrative for this kind of item. The civilian-grade variants of the SITES \"Spectre\" M4 have namely been a semi-automatic pistol called the SITES \"Falcon\" (marketed in the United States as the \"Spectre-HC\") and a semi-automatic sub-carbine called the SITES \"Ranger\". These weapons retain the main layout of the original \"Spectre\" submachine gun, are incapable of fully automatic fire, and the original magazine capacity is reduced for marketing in countries where the law requires it (such as Italy).\n\nThe SITES \"Falcon\" (or \"Spectre-HC\") pistol may or may not be encountered with the original top-folding stock and foregrip (the samples sold in the United States as the \"Spectre-HC\" generally feature none of these; the \"Falcon\" sold in Italy feature both, with the foregrip being removable).\n\nThe SITES \"Ranger\" sub-carbine, which was a distinctly Italian market gun, features the foregrip (which is removable), a longer barrel, and the top-folding stock is permanently locked into open position to comply with the requirements of the Italian laws about the minimum allowed length for civilian-legal long arms. The top-folding stock on the SITES \"Ranger\" subcarbine was, however, engineered to be easily removable for storage. In the version of this carbine sold in Italy, the removal of the stock was made harder, requiring the use of tools, and proceeding to effectively shorten the weapon by this way could be prosecuted as a criminal offense. In other countries (where legal), the removal of the stock in this and other versions was easier.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187135", "title": "Northern Province, Zambia", "text": "Northern Province, Zambia\n\nNorthern Province is one of Zambia's ten provinces. It covers approximately one sixth of Zambia in land area. The provincial capital is Kasama. The province is made up of 12 districts, namely Kasama District (the provincial capital), Chilubi District, Kaputa District, Luwingu District, Mbala District, Mporokoso District, Mpulungu District, Mungwi District, Nsama District, Lupososhi District, Lunte District and Senga Hill District. Currently, only Kasama and Mbala have attained municipal council status, while the rest are still district councils. It is widely considered to be the heartland of the Bemba, one of the largest tribes in Zambia.\n\nSince this article was published the new Muchinga Province has taken the Eastern districts of Northern Province and Chama district to form Zambia's tenth province.\n\nNotable landmarks in Northern Province include Lake Tanganyika, Lake Bangweulu, and the corresponding wetlands, Lake Mweru-wa-Ntipa, and a number of waterfalls including Lumangwe Falls, Kabwelume Falls, Chishimba and Kalambo Falls.\n\nEfforts are being made by the Zambian government, along with a number of non-governmental organizations, to increase the visibility of the many natural and historical treasures in the Northern Province. Tourism has proven an effective way to bring economic growth in other parts of Zambia, i.e. Livingstone and Victoria Falls. However, a lack of infrastructure along the vast distances between major points of interest makes visiting this part of the country difficult.\n\nNorthern Province, with a total area of 77,650 square kilometers, shares borders with two other provinces - Muchinga and Luapula, and also with two countries - the Democratic Republic of Congo in the north and Tanzania in the north-east.\n\nThe Northern Province lies mainly on the great southern African plateau which has been uplifted to an elevation around 1200 metres above sea level. Rift valleys extend clockwise around the province from the north-west to the south. These rift valleys are sometimes outside the borders of the province, as in the case of the Luapula-Mweru valley to the north-west and the Lake Rukwa and Lake Malawi rift valleys to the north east; but the escarpments of the Lake Mweru-wa-Ntipa-Lake Tanganyika rifts in the north, and the Luangwa Valley rift in the east and south-east are just within the province. In places the rift valleys have pushed up highlands: around Kambole and Mbala above Lake Tanganyika, (the Muchinga escarpment above the Luangwa valley, and the highlands along north-eastern border with Tanzania and Malawi which culminate in the Mafinga Hills and Nyika Plateau. These are now in Muchinga Province)\nThese features produce a diverse landscape that varies and poses different challenges, particularly to highway construction, as one moves from one part to another. The Mafinga Hills, which include the highest point in the country at 2301 metres above sea level, once formed a formidable barrier between the Northern and Eastern Provinces that few but the best 4-wheel drive vehicles dared to cross, especially during the rainy season. The shortest road link between the two provinces is now eased by the rehabilitation of the Isoka-Muyombe Road, which traverses their lower slopes.\n\nRivers, streams and dambos criss-cross the province in profusion, posing yet another great challenge to easy movement of people, goods, and services. The most prominent river on the eastern side is the Luangwa, which has its source in the Mafinga Hills, and which has no road across its valley for a distance of about 800 km. Africa's second longest river, the Congo, has its source in Northern Province via its longest tributary, the Chambeshi River, which rises in the hills south-west of Mbala and divides the province diagonally as it meanders to Lake Bangweulu in the south-west. During times of very heavy rains, these rivers, particularly the Chambeshi and Luangwa, spread across floodplains often several kilometres wide, and create large tracts of both seasonal and permanent lagoons and swamps along their valleys. The Chambeshi feeds the largest wetlands of all, the Bangweulu Wetlands and floodplain in Mpika and Chilubi Districts, known for its Lechwe and birds among other wildlife.\n\nThe province also contains three large natural lakes - Lake Bangweulu and its adjacent wetlands (shared with Luapula Province), Lake Mweru-wa-Ntipa in Kaputa District, and the vast Lake Tanganyika in the north, which forms part of Zambia's border with DR Congo and Tanzania.\n\nThe above are the national parks and other wildlife areas of Northern Province.\n\nAs per the 2010 Zambian census, Northern Province had a population of 1,105,824 accounting to 8.47% of the total Zambian population of 13,092,666. There were 546,851 males and 558,973 females, making the sex ratio to 1,022 for every 1,000 males, compared to the national average of 1,028. The literacy rate stood at 61.00% against a national average of 70.2%. The rural population constituted 81.68%, while the urban population was 18.32%. The total area of the province was 77,650 km and the population density was 14.20 per km. The population density during 2000 Zambian census stood at 14.20. The decadal population growth of the province was 3.20%. The median age in the province at the time of marriage was 20.1. The average household size was 5.0, with the families headed by females being 3.9 and 5.3 for families headed by men. The total eligible voters in the province was 67.40%. The unemployment rate of the province was 6.30%. The total fertility rate was 7.1, complete birth rate was 6.5, crude birth rate was 41.0, child women population at birth was 880, general fertility rate was 182, gross reproduction rate was 2.8 and net reproduction rate was 2.1. The total labour force constituted 60.20% of the total population. Out of the labour force,66.9% were men and 54.1% women. The annual growth rate of labour force was 3.4%. Bemba was the most spoken language with 69.20% speaking it. Albinism is a condition where the victims do not have any pigment in their skin, hair or eyes. The total population in the province with the condition stood at 2,571. The life expectancy at birth stood at 46 compared to the national average of 51.\n\nNorthern Province has a number of tribal groups speaking different languages and dialects. However, the language mostly spoken across the province is Icibemba, which is one of the mother tongue of the largest tribal grouping, the Bemba people of Chinsali, Kasama, Mungwi and parts of Mporokoso and Luwingu districts. Other prominent languages include Icinamwanga, spoken by the Namwanga people of Nakonde and Isoka districts, ChiTumbuka, spoken by the Tumbuka people of Lundazi, and Icimambwe, spoken by the Mambwe of Mbala district. Despite its size and the diversity of languages and dialects, the people of Northern Province generally share a common culture.\n\nEach of these tribes has its own traditional leadership headed by either a paramount or senior chief assisted by junior chiefs and village headmen. The most prominent of the chiefs in the province is Chitimukulu, Paramount Chief of the Bemba. Others include Senior Chief Kopa of the Bisa, Senior Chief Muyombe of the Tumbuka, Senior Chieftainess Nawaitwika of the Namwanga, Senior Chief Tafuna of the Lungu and Senior Chief Nsokolo of the Mambwe.\n\nNorthern Province has no industry at all, and its primary economic activity is agriculture. The most commonly grown crops are maize, millet, sorghum, groundnuts, beans, and rice. Most of the food produced is consumed within the province, though a small percentage is bought by traders for resale along the line of rail.\n\nThere are very few farmers who grow crops on a commercial basis in the province. Most of the people are peasant subsistence farmers using the traditional \"slash and burn\" shifting cultivation locally known as \"chitemene\", and are barely able to even produce enough to feed themselves. There is also some commercial fishing being done on Lake Tanganyika by established fishing companies in Mpulungu. Most of the fish caught is taken for sale in Lusaka and the Copperbelt on refrigerated trucks. Fishing is also done by small-scale fishermen, who sell their small catches to local traders and others who resell the fish in the nearby towns of Mbala and Kasama.\n\nMpulungu, 208 km from Kasama, is Zambia's only port, and its harbour is generally used to export bulky goods, such as sugar and cement, to Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In turn, Zambia also imports Kapenta (small, dried fish) and other merchandise from these two countries, as well as Tanzania, through the same port.\n\nThe total area of crops planted during the year 2014 in the province was 191,104.56 hectares which constituted 10.07% of the total area cultivated in Zambia. The net production stood at 351,249 metric tonnes, which formed 8.62% of the total agricultural production in the country. Mixed beans was the major crop in the province with 31,898 metric tonnes, constituting 51.66% of the national output.\n\nNorthern Province has poor communication infrastructure. The telecommunication facilities, which were obsolete until 2005, have somewhat improved with the introduction of cellular phone services in all 12 districts. Prior to this, the situation was so bad that it was easier to make a telephone call outside the province than to any other district within the province as the telephone facilities in these districts were often out of use. However, these cellular phone services are quite costly for government ministries to afford.\n\nThe road network is in a poor state. Despite having a total area of 147,826 square kilometers, the province has approximately only 900 kilometers of tarmac, a large portion of which is in dire need of rehabilitation. The rest are gravel roads, the majority of which are in so bad a state that they are almost impassable.\n\nProvincial administration is set up purely for administrative purposes. The province is headed by a minister appointed by the President and there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the Permanent Secretary, appointed by the President. There is a Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Northern Province is divided into twelve districts, namely, Chilubi District, Kaputa District, Kasama District, Luwingu District, Mbala District, Mporokoso District, Mpulungu District, Mungwi District, Lupososhi District, Senga Hill District, Lunte District and Nsama District. All the district headquarters are the same as the district names. There are eleven councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called councilor. Each councilor holds office for three years. The administrative staff of the council is selected based on Local Government Service Commission from within or outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located in each of the district headquarters and has provincial local government officers and auditors. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. The elected members of the council do not draw salaries, but are paid allowances from the council. Northern is a predominantly rural district and hence there are no city or municipal councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Councils are mandated to maintain each of their community centres, zoos, local parks, drainage system, playgrounds, cemeteries, caravan sites, libraries, museums and art galleries. They also work along with specific government departments for helping in agriculture, conservation of natural resources, postal service, establishing and maintaining hospitals, schools and colleges. The councils prepare schemes that encourage community participation.\n\nNorthern Province has twenty-four high schools. Twenty-one are run by the government, while four are grant-aided (managed by the Catholic Church and the United Church of Zambia with financial support from the government).\n\nAll the government high schools run from Grade 10 to 12, while the four managed by the church run from Grade 8 to 12. Six of them are single-sex schools, while the rest admit both girls and boys. There are eight schools that enroll boarding pupils only, while all the others enroll both boarding and day pupils.\n\nAs of 2004, the province had 1,208 basic schools, 26 high schools and the number of school children out of school in ages between 7 and 15 stood at 1,208 . The unemployment rate was 7 per cent and the general unemployment rate for youth stood at 12 per cent as of 2008. The province had 40 doctors as of 2005. There were 331 Malaria incidence for every 1,000 people in the province as of 2005 and there were 6,958 AIDS death as of 2010.\n"}

When built, she was one of the largest seagoing vessels in the world. The construction of \"Kronan\" lasted from 1668 to 1672 and was delayed by difficulties with financing and conflicts between the shipwright Francis Sheldon and the Swedish admiralty. After four years of service, the ship foundered in rough weather at the Battle of Öland on 1 June 1676: while making a sharp turn under too much sail she capsized, and the gunpowder magazine ignited and blew off most of the bow. \"Kronan\" sank quickly, taking about 800 men and more than 100 guns with her, along with valuable military equipment, weapons, personal items, and large quantities of silver and gold coins.\n\nThe loss of \"Kronan\" was a hard blow for Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being the largest and most heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an important status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with \"Kronan\", the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the defeat at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war.\n\nMost of the guns that sank with \"Kronan\" were salvaged in the 1680s, but eventually the wreck fell into obscurity. Its exact position was rediscovered in 1980 by the amateur researcher Anders Franzén, who had also located the 17th-century warship \"Vasa\" in the 1950s. Yearly diving operations have since surveyed and excavated the wreck site and salvaged artifacts, and \"Kronan\" has become the most widely publicized shipwreck in the Baltic after \"Vasa\". More than 30,000 artifacts have been recovered, and many have been conserved and put on permanent public display at the Kalmar County Museum in Kalmar. The museum is responsible for the maritime archaeological operations and the permanent exhibitions on \"Kronan\".\n\nIn the 1660s, Sweden was at its height as a European great power. It had defeated Denmark, one of its main competitors for hegemony in the Baltic, in both the Torstenson War (1643–45) and the Dano-Swedish War (1657–58). At the Treaties of Brömsebro (1645) and Roskilde (1658), Denmark had been forced to cede the islands of Gotland and Ösel, all of its eastern territories on the Scandinavian Peninsula, and parts of Norway. In a third war, from 1658 to 1660, King Charles X of Sweden attempted to finish off Denmark for good. The move was bold royal ambition in an already highly militarized society geared for warfare, a fiscal-military state. Disbanding its armies would have required paying outstanding wages, so there was an underlying incentive to keep hostilities alive and let soldiers live off enemy lands and plunder. The renewed attack on Denmark threatened the interests of the leading shipping nations of England and the Dutch Republic, who were best served by keeping the Baltic region politically divided. The Dutch intervened in 1658 by sending a fleet to stop the attempt to crush Denmark. England also sent a fleet in November the same year, to assist Sweden in keeping the Sound Toll out of Danish and Dutch control. The English expedition failed as a result of adverse winter weather and the political turmoil that ended the Protectorate, and in the end, Charles' plans were thwarted.\n\nCharles X died in February 1660. Three months later, the Treaty of Copenhagen ended the war. Charles' son and successor, Charles XI, was only five when his father died, so a regency council—led by the queen mother Hedvig Eleonora—assumed power until he came of age. Sweden had come close to control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to prevent the formation of a powerful anti-Swedish alliance that included Denmark. There were some successes in foreign policy, notably the anti-French Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic. By early 1672, Sweden had improved its relations with France enough to form an alliance. The same year, King Louis XIV attacked the Dutch Republic, and in 1674 Sweden was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic's northern German allies. France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies on condition that it moved in force on Brandenburg. A Swedish army of 22,000 men under Carl Gustaf Wrangel advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Swedish arms had enjoyed since the Thirty Years' War. This emboldened Sweden's enemies, and by September 1675 Denmark, the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire were at war with Sweden and France.\n\nBy 1675 the Swedish fleet was numerically superior to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the Swedish ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced a larger proportion of its vessels with more modern warships. The Swedish side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.\n\nThe First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the development of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, naval tactics had favored short-range firepower and boarding with intent to take prizes. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance firepower. This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough to hold the line in the face of enemy fire. The increased centralization and concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships. Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program in the late 1660s.\n\n\"Kronan\" was one of the most heavily armed warships in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, Swedish warships were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When \"Kronan\" was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.\n\nThe measurements for \"Kronan\" were recorded in contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53 m (174 ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9 m (42 ft) and was defined as the widest point between the frames, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8 m (20–22 ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66 m (217 ft).\n\n\"Kronan\"s displacement – the ship's weight calculated by how much water it displaced while floating – is not known precisely, since there are no exact records of the dimensions. By using contemporary documents describing the approximate measurements, it has been estimated at around 2,300 tonnes. By its displacement in relation to the number and weight of guns, \"Kronan\" was over-gunned, though this was not uncommon for the era. European shipwrights had not been building three-deckers on a large scale before the 1650s; by the 1660s, designs were still quite experimental. Contemporary records show that English and French three-deckers tended to be rather unstable because they were built high, narrow and with too much artillery. Some English ships had to be reinforced with a \"girdle\" of built-up planking at the waterline to perform satisfactorily. In rough seas these ships could be forced to close the lowest row of gunports, depriving them of their heaviest and most effective guns. In these situations they were effectively just over-priced two-deckers. \"Kronan\"s construction was not inherently flawed; the ship handled harsh weather conditions in 1675 and again only a week before capsizing, but she could be dangerous if handled poorly. Later, during the 18th century, ships with the same weight of guns had more tonnage to support their guns, usually weighing 3,000–5,000 tonnes, which made them more stable. When \"Kronan\" was built, she was the third or fourth largest ship in the world, but as the trend moved towards ever greater ships, she was surpassed by other large warships. At the time \"Kronan\" sank, she was down to seventh place.\n\nAccording to the official armament plan \"Kronan\" was to be equipped with 124–126 guns; 34–36 guns on each of the gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed by the weight of the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36 pounds (1.3–15.3 kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500 lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed in the middle of the lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. \"Kronan\"s most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.\n\nAccording to modern research, the number of guns was considerably less than the official armament plan. At the time, armament plans regularly overstated the number of guns available. In reality, they were ideal estimations that seldom reflected actual conditions, either because of a lack of ordnance or because they were impractical when tested. Heavy 30- and 36-pounder guns were particularly difficult to find in sufficient numbers and lighter guns were frequently used instead. Going by the number of guns salvaged from \"Kronan\" in the 1680s (see \"History as a shipwreck\") and during the excavations in the 1980s the total comes to 105–110. The upper figure matches the calculations of the number of gunports on the remains of the wreck and the number of guns that could practically fit on the gun decks. The lower figure is the number of guns found in the 1980s excavations combined with the list of guns brought up during the salvage operations in the 1680s. The table below lists the number of guns, comparing the official 1671 armament plan to the calculations by naval historian Jan Glete.\n\nSeveral types of ammunition were available, each for different uses: round shot (cannonballs) against ship hulls, chain shot against masts and rigging, and canister shot (wooden cylinders filled with metal balls or fragments), which had a devastating effect on tightly packed groups of men. For boarding actions \"Kronan\" was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – \"hakebössor\", similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing to allow it to absorb the recoil of the charges. One \"hakebössa\" was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.\n\nExpensive and elaborate ornamentation was an important part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of \"Kronan\", but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of \"Kronan\" shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of \"Vasa\", a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows \"Kronan\" as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.\n\nArchaeologists have not been able to recover enough of \"Kronan\"s sculptures for a detailed reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.\n\nIn the early 1660s, a building program was initiated to expand the fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to replace the old \"Kronan\" from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun in the winter of 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and bowsprit.\n\nThe construction of \"Kronan\" began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came in conflict with the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.\n\nAs one of the largest ships of her time, \"Kronan\" had a sizable crew. When she sank there were 850 people on board – 500 sailors and 350 soldiers. Historians working with the excavation of the wreck site have compared the ship with a middle-sized Swedish town of the late 17th century, describing it as a \"miniature society\". On board were male representatives of both lower and upper classes. (Women were allowed on navy vessels only within the limits of Stockholm archipelago; before reaching the open sea, they had to disembark.) As a community afloat, \"Kronan\" mirrored the contemporary social standards of military and civilian life, two spheres that were not strictly separated in the 17th century.\n\nThe entire crew dressed in civilian clothing and there were no common navy uniforms. The Swedish army had only recently introduced standardized uniforms, something that was still uncommon in most of Europe. Clothing was differentiated according to social standing, with officers from the nobility dressed in elegant and expensive clothing while the ordinary crew dressed like laborers. The only exceptions were the soldiers of the Västerbotten infantry regiment who had by the 1670s been equipped with the first \"Carolingian\" uniforms in blue and white. The crew was sometimes assigned clothing or cloth with which to prepare \"sailor garb\" (\"båtmansklädning\"), which set them apart from the usual dress of the general populace. Officers maintained a large collection of fine clothing for use on board, but it is not known if it was used during everyday work. Quite likely they owned a set of clothes made from simpler, more durable and more comfortable fabrics which were more practical at sea.\n\nRecruitment was done by forced musters as part of the earlier form of the so-called allotment system. Sailors and gunners were supplied by a \"båtsmanshåll\" (literally \"sailor household\"), small administrative units in coastal regions that were assigned the task of supplying the fleet with one adult male for navy service. The soldiers on board were recruited from the army equivalents, \"knekthåll\" or \"rotehåll\", (\"soldier\" or \"ward household\") from inland areas. Officers originated mainly from the nobility or from the upper middle class, and were paid through the allotment system or the income from estates designated for the purpose. Higher-ranking officers most likely brought their personal servants on board. A valuable red jacket in bright red cloth that was worn by one of those who drowned on the ship could have belonged to one of these retinues.\n\nAfter the Swedish loss at the battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675, the fleet was to support troop transports to reinforce Swedish Pomerania. It had potential for success as it was equipped with several large, well-armed ships: \"Svärdet\" (\"the sword\") of 1,800 tonnes, \"Äpplet\" (\"the orb\") and \"Nyckeln\" (\"the key\"), both 1,400 tonnes, and the enormous \"Kronan\" (\"the crown\"). Altogether there were 28 large and medium warships and almost the same number of smaller vessels. The supply organization was lacking. There were few experienced high-ranking officers and internal cooperation was poor; Danish contemporaries scornfully described the Swedish Navy crews as mere \"farmhands dipped in saltwater\".\n\nWith \"Kronan\" as its flagship, the fleet went to sea in October 1675 under Admiral of the Realm (\"riksamiral\") Gustaf Otto Stenbock, but got no farther than Stora Karlsö off Gotland. The weather was unusually cold and stormy and the ships could not be heated. The crew were poorly clothed and soon many of them fell ill. Supplies dwindled, and after \"Kronan\" lost a bow anchor after less than two weeks at sea, Stenbock decided to turn back to the Dalarö anchorage north of Stockholm. Nothing came of the reinforcements of the North German provinces. King Charles reacted with anger and held Stenbock personally responsible for the failed expedition, forcing him to pay more than 100,000 dalers out of his own pocket. King Charles later rehabilitated Stenbock by giving him an army appointment in Norway, but in early 1676 he replaced him with Lorentz Creutz, a prominent treasury official. Naval historian Jan Glete has explained this as a step that was \"necessary in a time of crisis\" due to Creutz's administrative skills and treasury connections, but Creutz had no experience as a naval commander, something that would later prove crucial.\n\nAs the situation for the Swedish army in Pomerania deteriorated during the winter of 1675–76, the fleet, with \"Kronan\" as flagship, was ordered to sea again in a desperate attempt to relieve the hard-pressed Swedish land forces. The weather was unusually cold and large parts of the Baltic were iced in. The fleet, now under the command of the seasoned sea officer Claes Uggla, was blocked by ice when it reached Dalarö on 23 January. The Privy Councilor Erik Lindschöld had been assigned by the King to assist with the expedition, and he came up with the idea of cutting the fleet out of the ice to reach the open sea. Hundreds of local peasants were ordered out to open a narrow channel through the ice with saws and picks to the anchorage at Älvsnabben, more than 20 km (12 mi) away. On reaching the naval station on 14 February, three weeks later, it turned out that most of the sea outside the inner skerries was frozen as well. A storm hit the tightly packed ships and the ensuing movement of the ice crushed the hull of the supply vessel \"Leoparden\", sinking it. A Danish force had managed to reach the open waters farther off and observed the immobilized Swedish ships from a distance. When temperatures fell even further, the project was declared hopeless and Lindschöld gave up the attempt.\n\nEarly in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.\n\nAfter the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail close-hauled faster than the rest of the force and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the crucial weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed in on each other and were soon within firing range.\n\nAround noon, some distance northeast of Hulterstad, the Swedish fleet made what the military historian Ingvar Sjöblom has described as \"a widely debated maneuver\". Because of misunderstandings and poorly coordinated signaling, the Swedish fleet attempted to turn and engage the allied fleet before they had sailed past the northern end of Öland, which had been agreed on before the battle. Sharp turns in rough weather were known to be perilous, especially for ships that had stability weaknesses. \"Kronan\" turned to port (left), but with too much sail, and heeled so far over that she began to flood through the open gunports. The crew was unable to correct the imbalance and the ship laid over completely with the masts parallel with the water. Soon after, the gunpowder store in the forward part of the \"Kronan\" ignited for unknown reasons and exploded, ripping apart a large section of the starboard side forward of the mainmast. The remaining section rose with the stern pointing up in the air and the broken-off front part toward the bottom. She then rapidly sank with the port side down. When the wreck hit the seabed, the hull suffered a major fracture along its side, further damaging the structure.\nDuring this rapid sinking, a large proportion of the crew suffered severe trauma, as is shown by osteological analyses of the skeletal remains. Many of the remains had deep, unhealed lacerations on skulls, vertebrae, ribs and other limbs. There are two primary theories about the cause of the injuries. Osteologist Ebba Düring has suggested that discipline and social cohesion collapsed during the sinking. The crew would have resorted to \"all the means at their disposal, both physical as well as psychological\" to escape the ship, an interpretation that is echoed by historian Ingvar Sjöblom. Medical historian Katarina Villner, on the other hand, has proposed that the injuries were caused by the sudden and violent chaos of the sinking itself, which would have thrown men, heavy equipment and cannons around.\n\nThe loss of the Admiral's flagship threw the Swedish forces into disorder, and soon \"Svärdet\", next in line as fleet flagship, was surrounded by the allied admirals and set ablaze by a Dutch fireship after an extended artillery duel. Only 50 of the 650-strong crew escaped the gun battle and the inferno, and among the dead was the acting Admiral Claes Uggla. After losing two of its highest ranking commanders as well as its two largest ships, the Swedish fleet fled in disarray. \"Solen\" later ran aground; \"Järnvågen\", \"Neptunus\" and three smaller vessels were captured. \"Äpplet\" later sank after breaking her moorings off Dalarö.\n\nAccording to the artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak, only 40 men, including himself, survived the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 trumpeters, 14 sailors and 22 soldiers, which means that more than 800 had perished. Among them were half a dozen navy and army officers as well as the chief physician of the Admiralty and the fleet apothecary. Altogether around 1,400 men died when \"Kronan\" and \"Svärdet\" were lost, and in the days following the battle, hundreds of corpses were washed up on the east coast of Öland. According to the vicar of Långlöt parish, 183 men were taken from the beaches and buried at Hulterstad and Stenåsa graveyards. Lorentz Creutz's body was identified and shipped to his estate Sarvlax near the town of Loviisa, Finland, where it was buried. The losses were even worse since \"Kronan\" was the flagship and was manned with the best sailors and gunners in the fleet. When \"Kronan\" and \"Svärdet\" went down, they took with them the navy's entire stock of 30- and 36-pounder guns. Altogether over 300 tonnes of bronze guns worth nearly 250,000 silver dalers went down with the ships, a sum that was slightly higher than the value of the ships themselves.\n\nWithin a week, the news of the failure at Bornholm and the disaster at Öland reached King Charles, who immediately ordered that a commission be set up to investigate the fiasco. Charles wanted to know if Bär and other officers were guilty of cowardice or incompetence. On 13 June the King wrote that \"some of our sea officers have shown such cowardly and careless behavior [that they] have placed the safety, welfare and defense of the kingdom at great peril\", and that \"such a great crime should be sternly punished\". The commission began its work on 7 June 1676 and finished in October 1677, without passing any sentences. Admiral Johan Bär of \"Nyckeln\" and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who ran aground with \"Äpplet\", were never again given a navy command. One of the accused, Hans Clerck of \"Solen\", was promoted to full admiral by the King even before the commission presented its findings.\n\nInappropriate handling in rough weather was the most obvious cause for \"Kronan\"s sinking. Unlike \"Vasa\", \"Kronan\"s sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During the work of the commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to \"Vasa\". He testified that \"Kronan\"s ballast had been lightened at Dalarö at the beginning of the campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.\n\nWhy the Swedish fleet deviated from the original plan of engaging the allied force in home waters north of Öland has never been satisfactorily explained. According to Rosenberg and Gyllenspak on \"Kronan\", Creutz made a turn because Uggla had signaled that he was going about. Rosenberg also believed that Bär on \"Nyckeln\", admiral of the first squadron, was first to make a turn, and that Uggla considered it necessary to follow this unplanned maneuver to keep the fleet together. Officers Anders Homman and Olof Norman, who both survived \"Svärdet\", claimed that only Creutz as fleet commander could have made such a decision and that Uggla was only following \"Kronan\"s lead. Witnesses who testified before the commission claimed that conflict between the officers was the reason that necessary precautions were not taken before \"Kronan\" came about. Rosenberg testified that Lieutenant Admiral Arvid Björnram and Major Klas Ankarfjäll had openly disagreed on how much sail should be set and how close to land the ship should sail. According to Gyllenspak, senior fleet pilot Per Gabrielsson had voiced his concerns against turning in the rough weather, but no one had heeded his advice.\n\nSeveral scholars and authors have blamed Creutz for the loss of his ship, and he has been criticized as an incompetent sailor and officer who through lack of naval experience brought about the sinking. Historian Gunnar Grandin has suggested that the intent of the maneuver was to take advantage of the scattered allied fleet, but that many of the officers on \"Kronan\" opposed the idea; Creutz and Björnram urged that the ship turn quickly to gain a tactical advantage while Ankarfjäll and Gabrielsson were concerned about the immediate safety of the ship. Grandin has also suggested that Creutz may have suffered a mental breakdown after the failure at Bornholm and the open dispute with his officers, which led to a rash and ultimately fatal decision.\n\nMore recent views present the question of responsibility as more nuanced and complex – suggesting that Creutz cannot be singled out as solely responsible for the disaster. Historians Ingvar Sjöblom and Lars Ericson Wolke have pointed out that Creutz's position as admiral was comparable to that of a chief minister. He would have primarily been an administrator without the need for intimate knowledge of practical details; turning a ship in rough weather would have been the responsibility of his subordinates. Sjöblom has stressed that the disagreement between Major Ankarfjäll and Lieutenant Admiral Björnram on how much sail was needed wasted precious time in a situation where quick decisions were crucial. Creutz was also unique as a supreme commander of the navy since he had no experience of military matters. The Swedish naval officer corps in the late 17th century lacked the prestige of army commanders, and seasoned officers and even admirals could be outranked by inexperienced civilians or army commanders with little or no naval background. Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has suggested that Creutz's \"choleric and willful temperament\" probably played a part, but that it could equally be blamed on an untrained and inexperienced crew and the open discord among the officers. According to Sjöblom it is still unclear to historians whether there was a designated ship commander on \"Kronan\" with overall responsibility.\n\nThe total cost of \"Kronan\" was estimated at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary currency, and about half of the cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore in the interest of the Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons as possible. In the early 1660s almost all the guns from \"Vasa\" had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were put in charge of the salvage of \"Kronan's\" cannons. With the help of diving bells, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. June–August) of 1679–86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to \"Vasa\" with a diving bell made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on \"Kronan\". The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Öland were often difficult, with cold water and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian Björn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of \"Kronan's\" 36-pounder guns.\n\nThe marine engineer and amateur historian Anders Franzén had searched for old Swedish wrecks in the Baltic since the 1940s and became nationally renowned after he located \"Vasa\" in 1956. \"Kronan\" was one of several famous shipwrecks on a list of potential wreck sites that he had compiled. For almost 30 years Franzén and others scoured archives and probed the seabed off the west coast of Öland. During the 1950s and 1960s the team searched off Hulterstad by dragging, and later followed up with sonar scans. In 1971 planks believed to belong to \"Kronan\" were located, but the lead could not be followed up properly at the time. Later in the 1970s the search area was narrowed down with a sidescan sonar and a magnometer, an instrument that detects the presence of iron. With the two instruments the team pinned down a likely location, and in early August 1980, sent down underwater cameras to reveal the first pictures of \"Kronan\".\n\nThe remains of \"Kronan\" lie at a depth of 26 m (85 ft), 6 km (3.7 mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions to the site of the wreck from June to August. By Baltic Sea standards, the conditions are good for underwater archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20 m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile sand that reflects much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted so far and \"Kronan\" has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.\n\nMore than 30,000 artifacts from \"Kronan\" have been salvaged and cataloged, ranging from bronze cannons of up to four tonnes to small eggshell fragments. There have been several discoveries of considerable importance, and some of unique historical and archaeological value. One of the first finds was a small table cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments, pipe-cleaning tools, cutlery and writing utensils, which most likely belonged to one of the officers. As a flagship, \"Kronan\" carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins. Besides wages for the crew, a war chest was required for large, unforeseen expenses. In 1982, a collection of 255 gold coins was found, most of them ducats. The origin of the individual coins varied considerably, with locations such as Cairo, Reval (modern-day Tallinn), and Seville. Another 46 ducats were found in 2000. The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil, though it was not enough to cover large expenses, which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz. In 1989, more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop, at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden. In 2005, a much larger cache of nearly 6,200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7,000 coins. The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 öre-coins minted in 1675, which represented over 1% of the entire production of 4 öre-coins of that year.\nSeveral musical instruments have been found, including a trumpet, three violins and a viola da gamba, all expensive objects that probably belonged to either the officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board was a member of the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another remnant of the officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and cinnamon quills.\n\nApproximately seven percent of the finds consist of textiles. Much of the clothing, particularly that of the officers and their personal servants, is well preserved and has provided information on clothing manufacture during the late 17th century, something that has otherwise been difficult to research based only on depictions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Fixed rigidly to the underside of this heavy tube is an additional steel block that performs most of the tasks of a standard sub-machine gun bolt, that is, this part chambers the rounds and seals them in the chamber, fires them and extracts the empty cartridges. This section is however very small and light in comparison to the bolts of more conventional simple blowback sub-machine guns, as most of the necessary mass and thus inertia is provided by the tubular weight above.

By the time that the Brown Broadcasting Service organization was founded in 1962, radio broadcasting on the Brown University campus had turned from a hobbyist activity to a more serious enterprise. The organization purchased a commercial FM license in 1965 and aired its first broadcast on WBRU-FM on February 21, 1966. The station aired with a progressive rock format in the 1960s and 1970s, added new wave music into its playlist in the early 1980s, and switched to its current modern rock format in 1988. From 1966 to 2017, WBRU aired on the 95.5 FM frequency in the Providence market. In August 2017, Brown Broadcasting Service sold the 95.5 license to Educational Media Foundation and WBRU was replaced on that frequency by WLVO, a Christian adult contemporary station, at midnight on September 1, 2017. Although its primary alternative rock programming is no longer available on an over-the-air radio station, WBRU itself continues to be operated by BBS, and offers both its alternative rock and urban contemporary programming as an online-only programming provider. \n\nWBRU traces its origin to \"The Brown Network\", a low-power carrier current station that broadcast at 570 kHz on the AM band, and whose signal was limited to the Brown campus. (At this time, the two National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio networks were known as the \"Red Network\" and the \"Blue Network\".) This first-ever carrier current station was established 1936 by George Abraham and David W. Borst. Abraham had originally installed an intercom system between his and Borst's dormitory rooms. The intercom links were first expanded to additional locations, and then replaced by distributed low-powered radio transmitters, which fed their signals into various buildings' electrical wires, allowing nearby radio receivers to receive the transmissions. Abraham originally conceived of the idea as a way to share his record collection and serve as a personal disk jockey for his friends. By the next year, he had installed wires through the trees on campus in order to connect to a number of buildings, assigning students in individual dormitories to act as \"section managers\" who would receive the signal and retransmit it throughout the rest of their building. After being recognized as an extra-curricular activity, The Brown Network was assigned a studio and control room located in the Faunce House student union building.\n\nThe New England Hurricane of 1938 destroyed most of the distribution wires, and Borst and Abraham were forced to move the wires into the steam tunnels beneath the campus. On November 3, 1939, David Sarnoff, the president of the Radio Corporation of America (whose son attended Brown) made a broadcast over The Brown Network. On February 17–18, 1940 an organizing convention for the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) was held at Brown, attended by representatives from twelve colleges with existing or proposed carrier current stations. Abraham was elected the IBS Chairman, and Borst the Technical Manager. IBS's role was defined as a medium for the exchange of ideas and programs, in addition to working to attract national advertising contracts for the member stations. The first IBS intercollegiate broadcasts began on May 9, 1940, with a five-part series that was carried by stations located throughout New England at Brown, Harvard, Williams, and Wesleyan universities, in addition to the Universities of Connecticut and Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1945, student journalists began to use the WBRU call letters on air, which had been coined by undergraduate Stephen Plimpton.\n\nIn 1962, the Brown Broadcasting Service (BBS) was established as a separate entity from the University and in 1965, the BBS purchased a commercial FM license (WPFM) from a company that was \"bankrupt\". BBS was then split into two stations: \"WBRU-AM\" and WBRU FM. WBRU-AM continued to broadcast locally as a carrier current station (distributed through Brown's electrical system) and operated as the training station for WBRU FM.\n\nBrown Broadcasting Service began broadcasting from WBRU-FM at the 95.5 frequency on February 21, 1966; The first program to be transmitted from the new station was a panel show which discussed the Peace Corps.\n\nBy the mid-'60s WBRU was considered an alternative station in that much of the music was folk and rock. Joni Mitchell, Richie Havens, Joan Baez had a home on this station and were not yet on mainstream radio. After 1966 much of the music format was not mainstream. The station was considered an \"Underground Rock Music Station\" similar to Boston's WBCN. The station's playlist featured artists such as Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention, The Fugs, Pearls Before Swine, Phil Ochs, Country Joe & The Fish and other left-leaning rock acts that were not typically played on mainstream radio.\n\nDuring the 1970s, WBRU broadcast at 20,000 watts on 95.5 FM and established itself as the principal progressive rock (aka, album-oriented rock or AOR) station in Rhode Island and southern New England. Attempts to boost the signal to 50,000 watts with a transmitter on the Sciences Library failed because of the interference it caused to sensitive scientific equipment, but the station was making plans to move its transmitter to the WPRO-FM transmitter location and increase power to 50,000 watts. This could not be done until 2009 because public TV station WSBE-TV's analog TV antenna currently occupies the tower space where WBRU plans to put its broadcast antenna. WSBE is locating its digital antenna at the WJAR antenna tower in Rehoboth, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1988, WBRU switched its format to modern rock and has remained in that format ever since, although leaning towards playing newer artists and artists of the indie rock genre.\n\nWBRU was also frequently named one of the best radio stations in the country by numerous trade magazines such as \"Billboard\" and \"Rolling Stone\" (which named it best radio station in the country in a medium size market three years in a row, the only radio station ever to achieve that).\n\nThe station is part of the Providence music scene, and has been instrumental in introducing to the area alternative bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and countless other important bands. It was among the first radio stations in the United States to play Ben Folds Five and Talking Heads. Kurt Cobain's last radio interview before his death was on WBRU.\n\nBetween April 17 and April 21, 2006, WBRU played their entire music catalog by title from A-Z, starting at 5:30 p.m. with \"About a Girl\" by Nirvana on the 17th and ending around 11:15 on the 21st with \"Zombie\" by The Cranberries. The songs ranged from new music (by such bands as Panic! at the Disco and Zox), 1980s and 1990s pop rarely played by the station (such as Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\") and classic punk (i.e. Sex Pistols and New York Dolls).\n\nOn June 15, 2006, the station began streaming live online.\n\nWBRU aired its first voicetracked break at 5:17 PM on November 15, 2010, during the Afternoon BRU with Corey and Cato.\n\nIn March 2017, the station's board of directors passed a resolution to begin seeking a buyer for the station, after 60 years of being owned and operated by the independent non-profit Brown Broadcasting Service organization. Many student members and alumni of the station were opposed to the resolution.\n\nOn August 25, 2017, it was announced that Brown Broadcasting Service had sold the 95.5 FM terrestrial frequency to Educational Media Foundation, a Christian music broadcaster, which planned to take over the frequency on September 1. The WBRU call letters and brand were not included as part of the sale, and Brown Student Radio applied to the FCC to transfer the call letters to its low-power radio station. In a statement on its website, WBRU announced that it would continue operations as an online radio station, with separate feeds for both its traditional modern rock format and its \"360 Degree Experience in Sound\" hip hop and R&B program.\n\nWBRU aired for the last time on 95.5 FM at 11:59 p.m. on August 31 and was replaced on that frequency by Educational Media Foundation's K-Love Christian adult contemporary network. The final song played on 95.5 WBRU before the changeover was \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" by The White Stripes, followed by a final signoff by programing director DJ Chilbo. One minute later, at midnight on September 1, WBRU was relaunched as an online-only station, with the first song played being \"Welcome To Paradise\" by Green Day. Although the sale had not been completed by the time WBRU ceased broadcasting on 95.5FM, Educational Media Foundation opted to lease the frequency until the deal was approved.\n\nBrown University and its president, Christina Paxson, opposed the sale of the signal and license. In April 2017, Paxson e-mailed the station's board asking them to reconsider their plan and offered financial assistance to the station. In October, Paxson asked the board to consider a proposal from earlier in the year to sell the license to Rhode Island Public Radio instead of Educational Media Foundation in order to keep WBRU programming on the radio in some form.\n\nThe day of WBRU's final broadcast on FM radio, former student executive board member Tucker Hamilton alleged that the sale of the station's licence was coerced; Hamilton and other members of a WBRU alumni group asked Rhode Island attorney general Peter Kilmartin to block the sale to Educational Media Foundation. According to the attorney general's office, they met \"with alumni and their attorney as a courtesy, but as our attorneys explained, Rhode Island statute and regulation does not give the attorney general any legal authority to intervene, as is the case in nearly all private sales.” The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of the 95.5FM license to Educational Media Foundation on October 24, 2017. The transfer was finalized on November 4.\n\nIn January 2018, the WBRU callsign was transferred to a low-power Providence-based station located at 101.1 MHz and operated by the non-profit Brown Student and Community Radio group and the Providence arts and event space AS220. The group and its station are not affiliated with the current WBRU online station or Brown Broadcasting Service, but they have made an arrangement with both to rebroadcast WBRU's urban contemporary online stream over the air. Although the low-power station intends to eventually scale back on rebroadcasting WBRU programming as they introduce their own, they do plan to continuing airing some programs on a permanent basis, including the Sunday \"360° Experience in Sound\" hip-hop and R&B program. The alternative and indie programming continues to run on a 24/7 stream as well through the station's website and mobile app.\n\nIn 1997, WBRU's carrier-current AM station split off and became Brown Student Radio (BSR), broadcasting initially on WELH/88.1, under a license owned by The Wheeler School and online . In 2003, BSR added a community radio element to its mission, incorporating community members as programmers and volunteers alongside students. In August 2011 BSR lost their air time on WELH and became an internet-only station. In January 2015, BSR was granted an FCC license for an LPFM station WPVD-LP on 101.1FM in Providence, in conjunction with Providence Community Radio and AS220. The Brown Student Radio station adopted the callsign WBRU-LP on September 1, 2017. The LPFM radio station went on the air on January 3, 2018.\n\n95.5 WBRU was operated and run on a commercial basis. Its Program Director prior to the FM sale was Wendell Clough, who had been at the station for over a decade and was known by the on-air name \"Wendell Gee\", after the R.E.M. song of the same name. Its General Sales Manager was Jim Corwin, the former Vice President/Market Manager of Clear Channel Communications radio stations in Providence.\n\nWhile an over-the-air station, WBRU aired a modern rock format six days a week, featuring alternative rock and other related genres, such as indie rock and punk rock. On Sundays, the station switched formats to hip hop and urban contemporary in a day-long program called \"The 360 Degree Experience in Sound\". As an online-only station, WBRU now carries two separate, 24/7 feeds, one for each format.\n\nOn March 29, 2006, WBRU claimed to be sold to Initech (a reference to the 1999 film \"Office Space\") and changed the format of the station from alternative rock to \"Buddy FM\" - a variety hits format similar to the Jack format that had emerged at stations around the country. WBRU \"signed off\" on 4:57PM March 31, 2006, cutting out 10 seconds before the end of what they proclaimed to the final song played by the station, Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" by Green Day and was replaced by dead air until 5:02PM, switching to \"Buddy FM\" with \"The Sign\" by Ace of Base. The hoax was complete with telling radio sweepers done in-studio. Some examples included: \"Buddy FM: hits of the '70s '80s '90s and today... and the 1940s... and the 1850s...\", and mentions that the station was \"fun for the whole family\" after which the station played \"Me So Horny\" by 2 Live Crew. Local network television affiliates WJAR and WLNE-TV reported that WBRU had been sold without gaining confirmation about the story.\n\nIt was later found out to be an April fools joke, and, as of noon on April 1, 2006, WBRU had \"regained\" control of their radio station and began playing their normal playlist once again. As the climax for the joke, Rich Lupo, the owner of Providence rock club Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, claimed on air that he had \"purchased\" the station from \"Initech\" and given it back to the WBRU DJs. Later that day, the station's DJs confirmed that the entire stunt had been an elaborate April Fools' joke.\n\nIn 2006, WBRU was the first U.S. radio station to play \"Supermassive Black Hole\" by British band Muse and played the Beck single \"Cellphone's Dead\" before its release until Interscope Records filed a cease and desist order against the station.\n\nIn 2007, WBRU premiered the Smashing Pumpkins new single \"Tarantula\" only 15 minutes after KROQ-FM world premiered it, becoming only the second station in the country to play it and the first to play it twice when they played it a second time immediately afterwards.\n\nIn 2008, WBRU was the first station in the country to air \"I Will Possess Your Heart\" by Death Cab For Cutie, which it did at approximately 1:30 p.m. on March 18, 2008.\n\nIn 2009, WBRU was the first station to debut Say Anything's new single \"Hate Everyone.\" The single premiered at approximately 3:30 p.m. on August 17, 2009. The band's lead singer Max Bemis also premiered the song \"Crush'd,\" playing acoustic in studio.\n\nIn 2013, WBRU was the first station to play Macklemore's \"Thrift Shop\" as reported by Billboard Magazine.\n\n\nThe radio station holds a battle of the bands, the WBRU Annual Rock Hunt, which began around 1980 and was held most years since:\n\n\nEvery summer the station puts on the WBRU concert series. The shows usually feature a popular band and a few local acts opening up. Initially, there were about 10 shows per year which were free to the public and paid for by sponsor booths, but in recent years the station has started charging for these concerts and has reduced the number of shows to 3 per year. In 2010, the station resumed free single artist Summer Concert Series concerts in addition to the multiple band for-pay concerts. Past concert series include:\n\nThe station also has their Birthday Bash concerts in November to celebrate the station's anniversary. Although 95.5 WBRU first aired in February 1966 and Birthday Bash concerts are promoted with an anniversary date that dates to that year (i.e. 2016 as the station's 50th anniversary), the November date instead celebrates the first broadcasts made on its Brown Network ancestor in November 1936. From 2007 to 2010, the Birthday Bash was split from one concert to multiple concerts throughout November. Previously, the only time it was split was in 2001 where two concerts were held. Past Birthday bashes include:\n\nWBRU has a full news department, with sports news and entertainment news divisions. For 2007 they won the Massachusetts/Rhode Island Associated Press awards in the college division for Best Web Site, Best Investigative Reporting, Best Breaking News, Best Feature Reporting, Best Continuing Coverage, Best Sports Program, and Best Use of Sound, and the award for News Station of the Year.\n\nWBRU staff members have gone on to excel in a variety of areas. They include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187160", "title": "Alexey Shchusev", "text": "Alexey Shchusev\n\nAlexey Viktorovich Shchusev (; – 24 May 1949) was an acclaimed Russian and Soviet architect whose works may be regarded as a bridge connecting Revivalist architecture of Imperial Russia with Stalin's Empire Style.\n\nShchusev studied under Leon Benois and Ilya Repin at the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1891–1897. From 1894 to 1899, he travelled in North Africa and Central Asia. Shchusev was a diligent student of old Russian art and won public acclaim with his restoration of the 12th-century St. Basil Church in Ovruch, Ukraine. He dwelt on 15th-century Muscovite architecture to design the Trinity Cathedral in Pochayiv Lavra and a memorial church on the Kulikovo Field. He was then commissioned by the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna to design a cathedral for Marfo-Mariinsky Convent in Moscow. The result was a charming medieval structure of the purest Novgorodian style (1908–1912).\n\nShchusev embarked upon his most wide-scale project in 1913, when his design for the Kazan Railway Station won a contest for a Moscow terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway. This Art Nouveau design fused elements of the Kremlin towers and traditional Tatar architecture in one of the most imaginative Revivalist designs ever put to execution. The construction of the railway station, however, was not finished until 1940.\n\nAfter briefly experimenting with Neoclassicism, Shchusev turned to Constructivism in the 1920s. He taught at Vkhutemas from 1920 through 1924. Upon Lenin's death in 1924, he was asked to design a mausoleum for him. It took him just several days to come up with an original architectural solution blending Constructivist elements with features taken from some ancient mausoleums, i.e., the Step Pyramid and the Tomb of Cyrus.\n\nThere are two notable Constructivist designs of Shchusev: the Ministry of Agriculture or Narkomzem in Moscow (1928–1933) and the Institute of Resorts in Sochi (1927–1931), considered to be a major source for Alvar Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium.\n\nAfter the mausoleum commission, Shchusev was cherished by the Communist authorities. In 1926, he was nominated director of the Tretyakov Gallery. He was appointed head of the group that designed major bridges and apartment complexes in Moscow. His name was attached to the luxurious designs of the Hotel Moskva just a few steps from the Kremlin (1930–1938) and the NKVD headquarters on Lubyanka Square (1940–1947). Some say that he was the first to come up with the idea of Gothic skyscrapers in Moscow.\n\nIt is debated whether these Stalinist designs were really Shchusev's or if they were actually executed by his disciples. The discussion of their artistic merits was exacerbated when the Moscow authorities announced their intention to demolish the Hotel Moskva in 2004. Actually, all these designs, whether executed for Moscow, Tbilisi (such as a building of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute), or Tashkent, featured Shchusev's trademark blend of Neoclassical elements with national architectural traditions.\n\nIt is believed that the author of the Lenin Mausoleum in Moscow was one of the Shchusev's office architect Isidore Frantsuz. According to Russian architectural historian Alexei Klimenko: \"It was proven by architectural critic Selim Khan-Magomedov. The Soviet government did not want the public to know about the Jewish origin of the true author, and the work was credited to Shchusev\".\n\nA. Klimenko, who was a graduate student at the institute, where Khan-Magomedov was working then, said that Khan-Magomedov \"found the drawings, on which the name\" Frantsuz \" was scraped and on the top of it was written \" A. Shchusev. \" For that Khan-Magomedov was almost thrown out of the Communist party, and there was a scandal on the grounds of nationality: don’t trash their Jewish surnames into history of Soviet architecture in general, and the Red Square in particular\".\n\nThere is another known case where Shchusev was accused of plagiarism. In 1937, the architects L. I. Saveliev and O. A. Stapran appealed to the Union of Architects with a complaint against Schusev alleging that he assumed the authorship of their \"Moscow\" hotel project. As a result of that complaint Shchusev was removed from the board of the Moscow branch of the Union of Architects.\n\nIn 1946, Shchusev established the Museum of Architecture, which helped to preserve remnants of demolished medieval churches and monasteries. His last works of importance were the Komsomolskaya station of the Moscow Metro, whose decoration was stylized after 17th-century Muscovite churches, and the plan for reconstruction of Novgorod after the ancient city had been destroyed by the Nazis (in recognition of that, one of Novgorod's modern streets was named after him). Shchusev died four years after the end of World War II and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\nShchusev was awarded the Stalin Prizes in 1941, 1946, 1948, and posthumously in 1952; the Order of Lenin and other orders and medals.\n\nThe Shchusev State Museum of Architecture in Moscow has been named after him.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187161", "title": "Intellectual rights to magic methods", "text": "Intellectual rights to magic methods\n\nIntellectual rights to magic methods refers to the legal and ethical debate about the extent to which proprietary or exclusive rights may subsist in the methods or processes by which magic tricks or illusions are performed. It is a subject of some controversy. \n\nOn one side, many magicians argue that methods represent \"intellectual property\" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as \"exposure\" and many magicians react angrily to it. \n\nWhile many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all \"exposure\", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works – works with living and identifiable creators.\n\nThere are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. Copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. \n\nUnder the Berne Convention, member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is \"fixed\", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., copyright law only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves.\n\nThe idea–expression dichotomy specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.\n\nAnother potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose & Her Shadow.\n\nMagic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act against America Online to remove a video from their website.\n\nAn invention or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially patentable in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works.\n\nNotably, in 1938, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was sued by magician Horace Goldin over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a \"Sawing a woman in half\" trick. The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods.\n\nExamples of patented inventions for conjuring include:\n\nMagic methods are effectively forms of trade secret and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of \"confidentiality\" and \"contract law\" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information – i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright.\n\nA company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates. A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a non-disclosure agreement before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. \n\nInformation which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the public domain may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of confidentiality. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available.\n\nCourt cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of case law. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include:\n\n\nThe most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of ethics or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the International Brotherhood of Magicians, has a Code of Ethics which states:\n\nThe Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that \"exposing\" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians.\n\nHowever, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187162", "title": "Capital District Transportation Authority", "text": "Capital District Transportation Authority\n\nThe Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) is a New York State public-benefit corporation overseeing a number of multi-modal parts of public transportation in the Capital District of New York State (Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer and Saratoga counties). CDTA runs local and express buses, including an express bus service called BusPlus between Albany and Schenectady, and day-to-day management of three Amtrak stations in the Capital region–the Albany-Rensselaer, Schenectady and Saratoga Springs Amtrak stations.\n\nCreated as an act of the New York State Legislature in August 1970, CDTA was formed similarly to agencies in Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo. In 1970, CDTA purchased and took over management of the United Traction Company and Schenectady Transit.\n\nCDTA bus operators, dispatchers, and supervisory staff are organized in Local 1321 of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU).\n\nCDTA is overseen by a nine-member board of directors.\n\nAt the present time, the board representation includes:\n\n\nThere is also an executive director that handles day-to-day business, reporting to the board of directors. In 2017, the CDTA had operating expenses of $108.41 million and a level of staffing of 821 people.\n\nCDTA operates 56 routes, many of which connect neighborhoods to downtowns or downtowns to shopping areas; with six routes linking key towns together. Two routes, 11-UAlbany Shuttle and 286-RPI Shuttle, are shuttle services for area universities which are also open to the public. Service mostly runs from 5:30 a.m.-12:00 a.m. weeknights, 6:00 a.m.-12:00 a.m. Saturdays, and 7:00 a.m.-10:00 p.m. Sundays with the college routes running until 2:00 a.m. in Albany and Troy (with several RPI-only runs running until 4:00 a.m.).\n\nBefore CDTA, many of these routes belonged to the Albany-Nassau Bus Company (Routes 32/33) and United Traction. Buses run from Capital Depot next to CDTA's headquarters on 110 Watervliet Avenue in Albany.\n\nIn early 2011, CDTA announced its plans to restructure the Albany County bus routes in two phases. Phase 1 involved reconstructing routes within the city of Albany, with a public input campaign held until August 2011. The results were five new neighborhood routes and three commuter routes. Its goal was to have a more uniformed bus system without any route deviation. Phase 1 of the reconstructing went into effect on November 13, 2011. In August 2012, CDTA revealed the draft plan for Phase 2 of the reconstructing. Phase 2 involved reconstructing routes within the western and northern portions of Albany County, with a public input campaign held until September 2012. Phase 2 of the reconstructing went into effect on November 11, 2012.\nFormer bus routes that were part of the Albany Division include:\n\nBefore CDTA, many of these routes were run by Schenectady Transit, which became insolvent and was taken over by Schenectady County in the late 1960s. Buses operate from the Electric Depot, located at 2401 Maxon Road Ext. in Schenectady.\n\nOn May 24, 2010 CDTA implemented five new cross-town routes for Schenectady as a part of their new service plan, removing routes 51, 52, 53, 54, 59, 61, 62, 66, and 77 and combining them into routes 351, 352, 353, 354, and 358 (Route 358 has since been eliminated due to low ridership). This is a part of their new three-digit route identification system. Routes 530, 531 & 532 are express services to Downtown Albany replacing the former 55x bus route and do not carry any local passengers (Route 532 was combined with Route 531 on November 13, 2011).\n\nFormer bus routes that were part of the Schenectady Division include:\n\nThe City of Saratoga Springs service also operates from Schenectady Division. These routes run seven days a week. Before July 2007, the Saratoga Springs buses were operated from the Uncle Sam Depot at 40 Hoosick Street in Troy, with limited service. There was no direct connection to the Albany/Schenectady/Troy routes. Route #50 was operated from the Electric Depot at 2401 Maxon Road Ext. in Schenectady, and only provided one AM and one PM weekday trip between Schenectady and Ballston Spa. On July 2, 2007, the initial Saratoga Springs Route Expansion went into effect, with the implementation of a new three-digit route identification system. Route #50 was extended to provide hourly service, seven days a week; on NY 50 between Schenectady and Wilton Mall, with deviations along Rowland St and Geyser Rd in Milton as well as deviations along Excelsior Ave in Saratoga Springs. All of the Saratoga Springs buses began operating from the Schenectady Garage on Maxon Rd. Ext. On May 28, 2016, the Saratoga Springs restructure plan went into effect. Route #50 was renumbered Route #450 and rerouted to run along NY 50 from Schenectady to Wilton Mall with no deviations. New Routes #451 and #452 include former Route #50 deviations, as well as portions of old Routes #472 and #473. CDTA plans to eventually construct a Saratoga Springs bus garage at Grande Industrial Park, off of Geyser Rd.\nFormer Saratoga Springs bus routes that were operated by the Schenectady Division include:\n\nFormer Saratoga Springs bus routes that were operated by the Troy Division include:\n\nBefore CDTA, most of these routes were operated by the United Traction Co and the Troy-Fifth Avenue Bus Company. Buses run from the Uncle Sam Depot at 40 Hoosick Street in Troy, which also used to operate Saratoga Springs service prior to July 2007.\n\nFormer routes that were part of the Troy Division include:\n\nCDTA formerly ran three suburban shuttles, all operated by Albany Division, that used smaller cutaway vans, with the purpose of serving offices and major points of interest not on main CDTA routes, nor needing full sized buses. In November 2012, all Shuttle services were discontinued and replaced with fixed-route service during Phase 2 of the Albany County reconstructing. Two new bus routes (#117 and #155) were created. Route #117 operates between British-American Blvd, Albany International Airport, Wolf Rd, Colonie Center, Crossgates Mall and Twenty Mall. Route #155 operates between Albany International Airport, ITT Tech, NY 155, Washington Ave Ext., Walmart, and Crossgates Mall.\n\nThe 2005 plan included the development of bus rapid transit on the Route 5 corridor, between Downtown Albany and Downtown Schenectady, supplementing Route #55 (which handled 20% of CDTA's ridership). This plan also led to modifications on Routes #1 and #2. Queue jumping and signal priority were planned to make BRT more attractive to the region, after light rail was rejected. As of mid-2007, this part of the 2005 plan was placed on hold.\n\nIn early 2008, CDTA announced that it was going forward with the bus rapid transit line on NY 5, which included 19 upgraded stations. NY 5 BRT service began on Monday, April 4, 2011, with new silver and red-branded Gillig 40-foot hybrid buses, numbered Route #905 and referred to as BusPlus. When NY 5 BusPlus service began, Route #55 was renumbered Route #355 and shortened to provide Rt. 5 local service, between Downtown Schenectady and Colonie Center. Route #1 continues to provide Rt. 5 local service between Downtown Albany and Colonie Center. Route #55x (the Schenectady/Albany Express buses) was replaced with Routes #530, #531 and #532 (Route #532 was merged with Route #531 on November 13, 2011). Route #2 was replaced with Routes #125 and #138 during Phase 1 of the Albany County Route Restructuring in November 2011. BusPlus service runs the entire length of the Route 5 corridor, although it currently operates differently from the original plans. In the short term, transit signal priority and queue jump lanes are being constructed and will be rolled out as features of the bus rapid transit service. Articulated buses and ticket vending machines (TVMs) have not been purchased. Although it is called bus rapid transit, Route #905 is more of an enhanced limited-stop service than an actual BRT service, with only 19 stops between Downtown Schenectady and Downtown Albany. Improvements and expansions to BusPlus are still in planning, with proposed lines along the Washington Ave./Western Ave. corridor in Albany and along the NY 32/Broadway corridor between Downtown Albany, Menands and Troy/Cohoes.\n\nIn cooperation with the Saratoga Chamber of Commerce, CDTA operates open-air trolleys during the summer months. In the past, the trolleys would run from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day to serve popular destinations such as the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Spa State Park, the Saratoga Casino and Raceway, the Saratoga Race Course and Broadway. Prior to 2011, the trolley ran between Skidmore College and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. From 2007 to 2010, Route #471 provided summer service to the Saratoga Race Course, before it was discontinued due to low ridership. From 2011 to 2015, the trolley route ran between Broadway, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Spa State Park, the Saratoga Casino and Raceway and the Saratoga Race Course, to include areas previously served by Route #471. , trolley service to Skidmore College was discontinued, with year-round service to Skidmore College continued on former Route #473 and new Route #452. , trolley service to Saratoga Spa State Park and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center has been discontinued and replaced by a new route that runs between the Courtyard Hotel, Broadway, the Saratoga Race Course and the Saratoga Casino and Raceway. The 2016 changes also included free fare for all riders and service reduction to instead only run from Independence Day weekend to Labor Day. While not marked as such on the vehicles, this service appears as Route #875 on the Saratoga Service map.\n\nIn 1982, CDTA began providing paratransit services to riders who are medically unable to take regular transit services. ADA wheelchair-accessible buses were added in 1988; since 2004, all CDTA routes have been wheelchair-accessible. The Star fleet has had a variety of minibuses. Though for most of its history it has been dominated by the Orion II low-floor minibus, STAR has begun replacing older models with Startrans \"Senator\" cutaway vehicles. Other minibuses in the fleet include Ford \"ELF\" minibuses and several transfers from suburban shuttle routes (see below).\n\nThe NX: Northway Xpress is a group of express routes that links Albany to towns in Saratoga County which is operated under contract by Upstate Transit (which had been contracted to run the service since 2006). These routes run from Saratoga Springs, Ballston Spa, Malta, Clifton Park, Round Lake, and South Glens Falls to Downtown Albany. In October 2012, Northway Express fares and schedules were redesigned to increase ridership and service efficiency. Fare structure was consolidated from 5 zones to 3 zones, with the addition of an unlimited ride prepayment card. Service was also eliminated from areas with low ridership, including Mechanicville, Stillwater, Albany International Airport, SUNY Albany, Wolf Road and the Harriman State Office Campus. In May 2014, Northway Express service was expanded to Corporate Woods.\nUntil 2012, CDTA operated rural/lifeline services to several areas in rural Albany and Rensselaer counties, once per week, including routes #810 (Berne/Knox), #812 (Rensselaerville), #870 (Saratoga County Shuttle), and #96 (Rensselaer Rural, with summer Grafton State Park service); as part of CDTA's route restructuring, these routes are being phased out.\n\nAll buses are wheelchair accessible.\n\n327-328 = 2012 MCI D45OOCT = Upstate Tours / Northway Express Livery\n\nThe Gillig buses are part of a five-year contract between CDTA and Gillig awarded in April 2006,2011 & 2016 that replaced most of the 1998 Orion VI fleet. In December 2014, CDTA also awarded a contract with New Flyer for 20 articulated buses to be delivered over a five-year period.\n\nIn 2005, CDTA commissioned a transit development plan that would create a planned environment to react to needed changes in the CDTA organization.\n\nParts of this plan have included:\n\n\n"}

Crockett. As a youth, he became a fan of pro wrestling, which had thrived during the 1920s with such grapplers as Strangler Lewis and Joe Stecher dominating the scene.\n\nIn the early 1930s, a dispute arose over the bookings of new wrestling sensation Jim Londos, so New York City promoter Jack Curley negotiated an alliance between various regional managers that enabled Londos to travel the country as champion while allowing the promoters to share profits evenly across the regions. As a result of this arrangement, new wrestling \"territories\" emerged across the U.S., and in 1935, a 25-year-old Crockett, who had also served as a concert promoter while also owning a theater and a restaurant, decided to set up a permanent wrestling shop based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The organization, known as Jim Crockett Promotions, scheduled wrestling events in both Carolinas, as well as in Virginia, under the banner of Eastern States Championship Wrestling. Over the next decade, ESCW featured some of the top wrestling stars of the day. Then in 1948, wrestling's top promoters gathered in Waterloo, Iowa to form the industry's first true governing body, known as the National Wrestling Alliance. As the dominant force representing the Carolina region, Jim Crockett Promotions soon became an important member of the NWA, with Crockett serving as a chief lieutenant under longtime NWA President and leading St. Louis promoter Sam Muchnick.\n\nOver the next 25 years, Crockett's Carolina territory reigned among the most successful regions in the NWA, as he regularly sold out the 16,000-seat Greensboro Coliseum featuring such stars as Johnny Weaver, Rip Hawk, Swede Hanson, and Gene & Ole Anderson on his Championship Wrestling program.\n\nThe championship trophy of the Southern Hockey League was named the James Crockett Cup.\n\nIn 1976, the Crockett family purchased the Asheville Orioles and renamed them the Charlotte Orioles. They also saved the historic Calvin Griffith Park from being torn down and restored it to preserve its history. It was renamed Jim Crockett Memorial Park, and then DBA \"Crockett Park\" in 1977. The stadium was set on fire in 1984, three weeks before baseball was set to open.\n\nBy the early 1970s, an ailing Crockett was forced to retire, as his son-in-law John Rigley had begun to take over many of the territory's responsibilities. Crockett died on April 1, 1973, and control of the company was then ceded to his son, 28-year-old Jim Crockett, Jr., who took over the promotion and ultimately renamed it \"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling.\"\n\nJim Crockett Promotions would eventually hold a tag team tournament from 1986 through 1988 in honor of him called the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament.\n\nHe was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2015.\n\nHe was married to Elizabeth Jackson Eversole Crockett, with whom he had four children: James Allen Crockett, Jr., David Finley Crockett, Charles J. \"Jackie\" Crockett, and Frances Earl Crockett.\n\nEstablished in 1931, the Crockett Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to financially assist US military veterans who have returned home from service. The organization is named after Jim Crockett Sr. and maintains a strong association to professional wrestling and baseball. Various figures from the pro wrestling industry have endorsed Crockett Foundation.\n\n\n"}

Intended to use the new 24-cylinder Pratt & Whitney X-1800 engine, this proposal, which was for an aircraft substantially similar to the P-38, was assigned the designation XP-49, while the competing Grumman Model G-46 was awarded second place and designated XP-50.\n\nOrdered in October 1939 and approved on January 8, 1940, the XP-49 was to feature a pressurized cockpit and armament of two cannon and four machine guns. Two months into the contract, a decision was made to substitute the Continental XI-1430-1 (or IV-1430) for the X-1800. The XP-49, \"40-3055\", first flew on 11 November 1942. The prototype force-landed on 1 January 1943, when the port landing gear failed to lock down due to combined hydraulic and electrical system failures. The XP-49 next flew 16 February 1943, after repairs were made. Preliminary flight data showed performance was not sufficiently better than the production P-38, especially given the questionable future of the XI-1430 engine, to warrant disruption of the production line to introduce the new model aircraft. Consideration of quantity production was therefore abandoned.\n\nThe aircraft was flown to Wright Field, and after various problems, further work on the XP-49 was halted, and Lockheed focused their energies on improving the P-38 instead.\n"}

It serves as the provincial capital and the headquarters of Kasama District.\n\nIt is situated on the central-southern African plateau, approximately , by road, north-east of Lusaka, the capital and largest city in Zambia. \n\nKasama is located on the Great North Road from Mpika through Kasama to Mbala and on to Mpulungu, at the tip of Lake Tanganyika.\n\nThe city population grew considerably in the 1970s and 1980s after construction of the TAZARA Railway through the city, and the tarring of the Great North Road, Zambia. Its population, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, was 74,243 in 2000 and had increased to 113,779 in 2010.\n\nKasama is in the heartland of the Bemba ethnic group, whose Paramount Chief Chitimukulu maintains his headquarters from Malole, which is east of the city center.\n\nIn 1898/1899 a crisis over the succession of the Chitimukulu led to Bishop Joseph 'Moto Moto' Dupont gaining the agreement of Bemba chiefs to the British colonial Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia, Robert Codrington taking control of the area. Codrington established a boma at Kasama and the town's central location as well as its closeness to Chitimukulu's court led to it eventually becoming the largest and dominant town of the north-eastern lobe of what became Northern Rhodesia, then later, Zambia.\n\nThe town has a few modern facilities, among them are a Shoprite Checkers branch, Budget Stores, a local supermarket called PJT and four bakeries. The town has branches of Zambian commercial banks including Zambia National Commercial Bank, National Savings & Credit Bank, Atlas Mara Bank Zambia Limited, Standard Chartered Zambia, Cavmont Bank, Barclays Bank of Zambia and Indo-Zambia Bank Limited. The town has VISA and ATM services.\n\nMost people in Kasama are not formally employed and they run small businesses to earn a living. Kasama has around six internet cafes where people can access internet services. The hospital is the Kasama General Hospital, that provides locals with health services. The city has a police station and several police posts. The available mobile telephone operators include MTN Group, Airtel Zambia and Zamtel.\n\nThere are several Agri Based industries in Kasama, which include Northern Coffee Company Limited (NCCL), a subsidiary of Olam International, growing coffee at Kateshi Estates, and Kalungwishi Estates growing sugar cane and producing the Kasama Sugar brand.\n\nIn as much as there could be other tribes, Kasama district is highly populated by the bemba speaking people.\n\nKasama has the following residential compounds within the district council boundaries:\n\nThe compounds below are out of the council boundary:\n\nKasama is served by a good network of major highways, including (a) Kasama–Mpika Highway (b) Kasama–Mbala Highway (which are part of Zambia's Great North Road), (c) Kasama–Luwingu Highway and (d) Kasama–Isoka Highway.\n\nThe gauge TAZARA Railway connects Tanzania to the north via Kasama, with Zambia Railways at Kapiri Mposhi to the south.\n\nAir transport is accessible through Kasama Airport. It can accommodate small aircraft, and it is undergoing an upgrade to be able to accommodate larger aircraft. It was expected to be ready by the end of 2017.\n\nKasama recreational facilities include the Kasama golf club, which also offers tennis, volleyball, badminton, body building, and a small football ground with one stand that can seat less than a thousand people. The town has other football grounds where people can play soccer.\n\nThere are resorts at Chishimba Falls and guest houses and lodges such as the Chinchi's Nest and Kings Guest House, and 3 nightclubs.\n\nKasama district has five big rivers and these include, Chambeshi, Lukulu, Lukupa, Lubansenshi and Luombe. The Chishimba falls is found on the Luombe river and it is one of the major tourist attraction in Zambia. \n\nAt the end of World War I, when it consisted of a handful of government offices and a dozen stores, it was evacuated by its British population of a couple of dozen in the face of a surprise raid from the north-east by German East African forces under General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Not knowing that the armistice had occurred in Europe the day before, the Germans took the abandoned town on 12 November 1918 and continued south-west (there was no battle at Kasama since the British imperial forces were at Abercorn), agreeing a cease-fire at the Chambeshi River on 14 November when they were informed of the German surrender in Europe. For further details, see Von Lettow-Vorbeck Memorial.\n\nKasama is known for the Stone Age rock art in the surrounding area. The Chishimba Falls also lie near the town.\n\n"}

Diophantus was active in Mithridates' campaigns in the Bosporan Kingdom and elsewhere around the Black Sea, although their chronology is disputed. An inscription found during the excavations in Chersonesos glorifies Diophantus as \"the first foreign invader to conquer the Scythians\". \n\nDuring his first Crimean expedition, he relieved the siege of Chersonesos by the Scythian king Palacus and subdued his allies, the Tauri. He finished this campaign at Scythian Neapolis. During the second campaign, Diophantus checked another invasion of the Scythians, who had joined their forces with the Rhoxolanoi under Tasius. At one point during these campaigns he established a stronghold at Eupatorium on the eastern shore of the Crimea.\n\nAround 107 BC, Mithridates dispatched Diophantes to Panticapaeum with the task of persuading the Bosporan king Paerisades V to cede his kingdom to Mithridates. While he was in the city, the Scythians, led by a certain Saumacus, revolted and killed Paerisades, while Diophantes barely managed to escape to Chersonesos. Back in Pontus, Diophantes rallied his forces and sailed to Crimea with a large fleet. The Scythian uprising was put down and the Bosporan kingdom was reduced to a dependency of Pontus.\n\n"}

She is also best known as the lead vocalist behind the classic R&B ballad, \"A Dream\" from the group's \"In a Special Way\" album and is also the co-writer of the group's 1982 breakthrough hit, \"I Like It\" and the number-one hit, \"Time Will Reveal\".\n\nEtterlene \"Bunny\" DeBarge is the eldest of 10 children, born to Etterlene (née) Abney and Robert DeBarge, Sr. While spending her initial childhood in Detroit, her family moved to Grand Rapids when she was 16. Bunny would later recall years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her father, stating that he had started molesting her when she was seven and this carried on until she was 13. Bunny also detailed troubles in public school where she and her brothers were constantly bullied and taunted by black schoolmates for their multiracial ethnicity.\n\nBunny found solace in music, singing in her uncle's church as a child. She and her brothers soon participated in several groups together in various times. In 1972, DeBarge dropped out of school and married her first husband, for whom she'd be the mother of two children (they later divorced). Since she wasn't into instruments like her brothers were, Bunny taught herself how to write songs and compose melodies, which later paid off as she got older.\n\nIn 1979, after a couple years watching her brothers Bobby and Tommy ride to musical stardom as members of the band Switch, Bunny teamed up with her three brothers Randy, Mark and El and became the DeBarges. They signed with Motown after their demo tape was passed off by Switch's Gregory Williams to Motown CEO Berry Gordy, who was left impressed by the siblings and soon put the band on a salary.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1981, Bunny and her brothers worked behind the scenes mainly on the works of Switch, with Bunny in particular collaborating with her brother Bobby on songs such as \"Hold On to My Love\", \"Love Over and Over Again\" and \"My Friend in the Sky\". In 1981, Bunny co-produced the DeBarges' self-titled debut album and was featured on lead vocals alongside brother El on \"Share My World\" which they wrote. A year later, in 1982, the group brought along their teenage brother James, and shortened their name to just DeBarge. That year, they released their second album, \"All This Love\", with which the siblings found musical success, particularly with \"I Like It\", for which Bunny wrote parts of the lyrics, alongside her brothers Randy and El.\n\nThe group followed up this success with their third album, \"In A Special Way\", in 1983. The album yielded another hit with Bunny as a lyricist, with the gospel-influenced \"Time_Will_Reveal_(song)\". The album also included several more highlights including two more Bunny-composed ballads, \"Stay with Me\" and \"A Dream\", the last song Bunny took lead vocals on. Like \"All This Love\" before it, \"In a Special Way\" went gold, paving the way for the group's biggest success in 1985 with the \"Rhythm of the Night\" album, with the title track becoming a top five crossover hit. However, the album marked the beginning of the end of Bunny's tenure with the group.\n\nPressured to go solo after numerous arguments with her brothers, Bunny followed brother El out of the group in 1986 and the following year, Bunny put out her debut album, \"In Love\", releasing one single, \"Save the Best for Me\". The album failed to deliver any hits or stay on the charts long and Bunny soon left the label. Besieged by a growing drug addiction that had started during her heyday with DeBarge, she quietly exited from the music business at the end of the 1980s and with the exception of projects involving gospel music, including an album featuring some of her brothers, herself and their mother, Bunny hasn't released any more solo work.\n\nBunny DeBarge has been married twice. In several of DeBarge's albums, she is listed as Etterlene Jordan and is sometimes referred to as either Etterlene Jordan-Knight or Etterlene DeBarge Knight. Bunny is the mother of four children and a grandmother of fifteen and still lives in Michigan, having moved back to Grand Rapids after years living in California. Much like her brothers, Bunny DeBarge has dealt with drug issues, going back to her teen years, which started with marijuana and moving up to prescription medication during her heyday with DeBarge. It soon escalated to usage of cocaine.\n\nBunny entered rehab several times to kick her habit. In 2008, she broke her silence issuing her autobiography, \"The Kept Ones\", in which she talked about her father's abuse towards her and her siblings and her dealings with substance abuse. That year she appeared on the debut episode of the TV One series, \"Unsung\", in which she talked about her childhood and her time with DeBarge, along with brothers Randy and James. The trio again appeared on TV three years later in September 2011, on the show \"Lifechangers\" alongside Bunny's daughter Janae. James entered the rehabilitation program but left a few hours later. Randy left a few days later. Bunny entered the rehabilitation program and completed her entire experience. After leaving the rehabilitation program in West Hollywood, California, Bunny has been touring and focusing on her new album.\n\n\n\n\n"}
