{"id": "2280591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280591", "title": "Ohio State Route 844", "text": "Ohio State Route 844\n\nState Route 844 (SR 844) is a state route that runs between Beavercreek and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the US state of Ohio. The north–south signed route is a spur freeway which mainly passes through government-owned properties. For some of its path, SR 844 passes through Wright State University. The highway was first signed in 1995 on the same alignment as today. SR 844 replaced the SR 444A designation of the highway, which dated back to 1989.\n\nSR 844 begins at a partial interchange with Interstate 675 (I-675). The route heads northeast as a four-lane controlled-access highway, passing under North Fairfield Road. The road has a partial interchange with Colonel Glenn Highway, before passing on the southeast and east sides of Wright State University. The highway curves due north, having an interchange with University Boulevard. After the interchange with University Boulevard, the road curves northwest, passing over SR 444. Followed by an interchange with SR 444, SR 844 ends at Gate 15A of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nSR 844 is signed as \"McClernon Memorial Skyway\", after the late Brigadier General Glen J. McClernon. McClernon had been base commander during the time the university was being established—partially on land deeded to it by the Air Force base—and also had been a two-term mayor of Fairborn.\n\nThe entire length of SR 844 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes important to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).\n\nSR 844 was originally SR 444A, which opened by 1989. After a public comment period in 1994, ODOT changed the number to \"844\" by 1995. Although legally designated as \"McClernon-Skyway Memorial Drive\" on September 22, 1989, SR 844 is both signed and recognized by the state as \"McClernon Memorial Skyway\".\n\nThere are plans to add a ramp from northbound SR 844 to northbound SR 444, and to add a ramp from northbound SR 444 to southbound SR 844. As of October 2013, the status and funding for this project are unknown.\n"}

{"id": "2280607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280607", "title": "Short Belfast", "text": "Short Belfast\n\nThe Short Belfast (or Shorts Belfast) is a heavy lift turboprop freighter that was built by British manufacturer Short Brothers at Belfast. Only 10 aircraft were constructed, all of which entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), who operated it under the designation Short Belfast C.1.\n\nUpon its entry into service, the Belfast held the distinction of becoming the largest aircraft that the British military had ever operated up to that time. It was also notable for being the first aircraft to be designed from the onset to be equipped with full 'blind landing' automatic landing system equipment. Following the formation of RAF Strike Command and a reorganisation of transport assets, the RAF decided to retire all of its Belfast transports by the end of 1976.\n\nShortly after the type had been retired by the RAF, five Belfasts were sold and placed into civilian service with the cargo airline TAC HeavyLift. These civilian aircraft were used for the charter transport of various goods, including to the RAF. One Belfast is on display at the RAF Museum Cosford. A Belfast formerly operated by Heavylift Cargo is lying abandoned at Cairns Airport in Australia and is the subject of a legal dispute for fees between the airport and the current owner of the aircraft, Flying Tigers.\n\nThe Belfast has its origins in studies conducted by aircraft manufacturer Short Brothers into the possibility for matching an arrangement of four Bristol Orion turboprop engines with an airframe that had been optimised for the purpose of transporting various military stores during the mid 1950s. It was decided to continue these studies as part of the firm's management believed that it was highly likely that there would likely be an Operational Requirement issued for the Royal Air Force (RAF) seeking such an aircraft in the near future, although Sir Matthew Slattery, chairman of Shorts, expressed his doubt of the practicality of such an aircraft. Slattery believed that developing such an aircraft from scratch would lack sufficient market prospects and instead encouraged the use of as many components and systems from the existing Bristol Britannia transport aircraft as would be reasonably possible, a measure that was seen as logical and practical, acting to reduce development time and cost while improving reliability, with the downside of lesser performance.\n\nIn March 1957, Shorts submitted its first brochure on their proposed transport aircraft, designated as the \"PD.18\" and given the name \"Britannic\" to reflect its Britannia ancestry. The PD.18 only differed from the Britannia in terms of its fuselage and high-mounting of its wings; the wings themselves, along with the tail unit, engines, and major portions of the landing gear and various other systems were common to both types. The new circular cross-section fuselage was very large for the era, capable of accommodating a 12 ft-square load for the carriage of bulky loads such as radar units and the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM); it also allows for troops to be carried across two separate decks.\n\nDuring 1957, it became clear that there was a definite need within the RAF for a heavy freighter. Accordingly, the issuing of Operational Requirement ASR.371 soon occurred, which sought the procurement freighter capable of carrying a wide range of military payloads over long ranges. The envisioned aircraft was to be operated by Transport Command of the RAF. The military loads envisaged included artillery, more than 200 troops, helicopters, and guided missiles. In particular, the RAF issued an increased payload/range demand of 30,000 lb being carried over a distance of 3,600 n.m, greater than the Service had originally been considering.\n\nTo meet with the stated requirements, Shorts proceeded to develop their original proposal for the Britannic, which was basically stretched into the \"Britannic III A\". As the design of the proposed aircraft was repeatedly revised, it was progressively becoming less and less common to the earlier Britannia, incorporating a greater proportion of all-new components, sections, and systems instead. Amongst the changes made were a new centre section to the wing which added around 16 ft 6in to the span and the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Tyne engine. In January 1959, the Ministry announced its selection of Short's design to meet the requirement. Accordingly, in February 1959, work on the Short's project formally commenced, known by the internal designation \"SC.5/10\". On 21 December 1960, a contract for a total of 10 freighters, designated as the \"Belfast C.1\", was signed.\n\nOn 5 January 1964, the prototype Belfast conducted its maiden flight from Sydenham Airport, Belfast; it flew for 55-minutes by chief test pilot Denis Taylor alongside a crew of six people. Following the first flight, Taylor stated that \"It was the easiest ride I have had for a very long time... The aircraft was an absolute joy to fly. She's a beauty.\" The first two aircraft produced were equipped with dedicated flight-test instrumentation and were used to complete development trials, which totalled roughly 850 flight hours; certification was conducted to both RAF and Air Registration Board (ARB) requirements. The first autolanding was performed after only 120 hours' test flying, less than originally estimated.\n\nOn 5 October 1964, the first of the three flying Belfasts departed Northern Ireland for Torrejón de Ardoz, the Community of Madrid, Spain, to participate in two weeks of performance trials; this was the first flight abroad performed by the type. According to Shorts Brothers Chairman, C. E Wrangham, the Belfast had a forecast break-even point of 30 aircraft. Despite the order for only ten aircraft, the decision had been made to assemble the aircraft using production jigs.\n\nMultiple derivatives of the Belfast were proposed by Short. Two principal civil versions of the aircraft, designated as \"SC5/10A\" and \"SH5/31\", were mooted during the early 1960s. The SC5/10A was to have been a commercial freight derived directly from the Belfast C.1, retaining much of its design such as its large rear loading doors for access to the main freight hold. The payload was to be increased to 85,000 lb; reportedly, up to 150 passengers could be seated on a single deck while up to 288 people could be seated across a double-deck configuration.\n\nThe second civil variant to be offered, the SC5/31, was to have featured a swinging nose arrangement for loading purposes in place of the rear door layout used upon the RAF model of the aircraft. It was claimed that both the payload and maximum takeoff weight would be considerably elevated above its predecessor. One proposed configuration for the SC5/31 was as a transatlantic airliner, carrying a maximum of 138 passengers on the top deck and up to 55,000 lb of palletised cargo on the lower deck; it was projected that it would be capable of flying a payload of 100,000 lb on the London-New York City route. During 1964, Short revealed that it had approached British European Airways (BEA) with its proposal for a large double-deck short-haul passenger version of the Belfast.\n\nAdditional military versions of the Belfast were proposed. The \"SC5/35\" model was intended to be a strategic freighter capable of conducting very long range missions, while the \"SC5/15\" was an envisioned tactical transport configuration, the latter of which was claimed to have required very little modification from the existing aircraft. A more advanced tactical airlifter, designated as \"SC5/21\", was formulated to conform with the requirements of Operational Requirement OR.351, which was to have STOL (Short Takeoff/Landing) capabilities. It was intended to harness a boundary layer control system, to have been powered by a removable pack of three Rolls-Royce Limited turbocompressors installed in a hump above the fuselage, which would have discharged high pressure air over the flaps and control surfaces of the tail and wings.\n\nPerhaps one of the most extensive proposed modifications of the basic Belfast design, designated as \"SC.5/40\", was to be done in partnership with the American aerospace firm Lockheed Corporation. On this variant, the fuselage of the Belfast would have been paired with the wing of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, which would have readily enabled the adoption of turbojet engines in place of the turboprops. Speculated engines to power this variant included the Pratt & Whitney JT3D-3 (18,0001b) or JT3D-8 (21,0001b), Rolls-Royce Conway 550 (21,8251b) or Bristol Siddeley BS.100 (27,0001b approximately). A broadly similar but improved proposal, designated as \"SC.5/45\", was heavily promoted by Shorts for Operational Requirement ASR.364, partly on the basis that it would also enable a near-identical civil-orientated model to be produced for home and export use, designated as \"SC.5/41\". Detailed presentations on the \"SC.5/41\" and \"SC.5/45\" proposals were made to British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and RAF respectively, but no military order was forthcoming.\n\nThe Short Belfast was a large heavy-lift strategic transport aircraft. It featured a high-mounted wing, which carried a total of four Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the design of the assemblies of the surfaces of both the tail and wing of the Belfast had been derived from the Bristol Britannia. One of the major changes to the wing was its conversion to a wet wing, which was performed by Canadair. There are few other common elements between the Belfast and the Britannia, although there had been a much greater proportion intended during initial designs for the aircraft.\n\nThe fuselage of the Belfast was a relatively conservatively-stressed cylinder of a conventional design. It was developed with a target safe-life of 15,000 pressure cycles, which was fatigued tested using a complete fuselage immersed in a water tank. Fail-safe principles were used in the design of the large side door, rear ramp and door. Rolled Z-sections were used throughout the majority of the fuselage frames and stringers, while box beams are used where the exertion of heavier-than-average loads had been typically anticipated; the structure lacks any use of forgings or machined members.\n\nThe flying controls of the Belfast incorporated numerous features developed by Bristol and Canadair, in addition to Shorts; all three companies had heavily collaborated on its development. It used the same manual servo-tab system as used on the Britannia, but had some advancements, especially in terms of lateral control via a simpler spoiler configuration. Other advancements include the linking of the port aileron to the rudder to counteract adverse rolling due to rudder deflection, and the elevator is linked to the flaps to cancel out trim changes caused by flap operations. The Belfast was equipped with a full automatic landing system, produced by Smiths Aerospace, the first aircraft in the world to be designed to feature such capability from the onset of development. The autopilot and flight control system, known as the ASR 518, was triplex in the roll and pitch channels, with duplex or emergency simplex ability. The instrument landing system comprised many functions, such as an autothrottle, a head-up display, and radio altimeter.\n\nThe cargo deck, in a circular-section pressurized fuselage over (roomy enough for two single-deck buses), was reached through a \"beaver tail\" with rear loading doors and integral ramp. It was large enough that forklift trucks could work within the cargo hold. The main undercarriage was two 8-wheel bogies and a 2-wheel nose. The Belfast was capable of a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of over 220,500 lb (100 tonnes) – less than the contemporaneous 250-tonne Antonov An-22 and the 128-tonne Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, but more than the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It could carry 150 troops with full equipment or various vehicles, such as a single Chieftain tank, or up to three Alvis Saladin armoured cars, or a pair of Westland Wessex helicopters, or up to four Westland Whirlwind helicopters, or up to six Westland Wasp or Westland Scout helicopters, or a pair of Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM)s.\n\nOn 20 January 1966, the Belfast C.1 entered service with No. 53 Squadron on when XR367 (the sixth production aircraft) was delivered to RAF Brize Norton, Carterton, Oxfordshire. Four months later, No. 53 Squadron was relocated to RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, to make way for upgrades being performed at Brize Norton; they returned to RAF Brize Norton in 1967.\n\nFollowing the type's entry into RAF service, it became apparent that a major drag problem was preventing the initial five aircraft from attaining Short's desired performance. Modifications and testing were subsequently carried out, particularly on aircraft \"SH1818\" (which was at the time perfecting the RAF's requirement for CAT 3 automated landings at RAE Bedford), and a new rear fairing was developed, which had the result of raising the fleet's cruising speed by 40 mph.\n\nThe reorganisation of the new RAF Strike Command was to have repercussions on the RAF's Belfast fleet and ushered in the retirement of a number of aircraft types, including the Bristol Britannia and De Havilland Comet in 1975. By the end of 1976, the Belfast fleet had been retired and flown to RAF Kemble, Gloucestershire for long-term storage.\n\nTAC HeavyLift purchased five Belfasts for commercial use in 1977 and operated three of them from 1980 after being reworked to receive commercial certification. Ironically, some of them were later chartered during the Falklands war, with some sources suggesting that this cost more than keeping all the aircraft in RAF service until the 1990s. HeavyLift's Belfasts were again contracted to support the RAF during the first Gulf War, transporting vehicles and helicopters too large to be carried by the Hercules fleet.\n\nAfter being retired from TAC HeavyLift service, several were parked at Southend Airport for a number of years.\n\nOne aircraft was refurbished and flown to Australia in 2003, operated by HeavyLift Cargo Airlines. This aircraft is no longer flying; it was often visible parked on the General Aviation side of Cairns International Airport in Queensland, in company with one or two of the company's Boeing 727s. Now registered \"RP-C8020\", it was moved to the general aviation (western) side of the Cairns airport on 19 August 2011, after spending the best part of a year sitting on the Cairns International apron where it had been moved prior to the scrapping of the remaining company Boeing 727 (RP-C8016) at the end of September 2010. The HeavyLift titles were painted over on 28 August 2011, but the registration \"RP-C8020\" was still visible. The aircraft was photographed intact, but with no registration visible, at Cairns Airport on 7 August 2017. The plane continues to be on the same spot as of 17 March, 2020.\n\nA second Belfast, \"G-BEPS\" (SH1822), was to have joined her in Australia following refurbishment at Southend Airport, but was instead scrapped in October 2008. The last production Belfast (\"Enceladus\", XR371) is preserved at the RAF Museum Cosford. This aircraft was repainted before being displayed under cover at the National Cold War Exhibition.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the third and final single release from the album and was released on November 25, 1987 by Sire Records. While shooting for the film, then called \"Slammer\", Madonna had requested that producer Patrick Leonard develop a downtempo song that captured the nature of her film persona. She later wrote the lyrics and melody to the backing track developed by Leonard, and the song became \"The Look of Love\". Madonna was also inspired by actor James Stewart's performance in the 1954 film \"Rear Window\" when writing the song.\n\nFeaturing instrumentation from percussion, the song begins with a low bass synth line and a slow backing track, followed by Madonna singing the lyrics. Critically appreciated as a haunting track and noted as a \"gem\" on the album, \"The Look of Love\" reached the top ten of the charts in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It also charted in France, Germany and Switzerland, while reaching the top 20 of the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles. Madonna's only live performances of the song were on her Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987. During the performance Madonna pretended that she was lost on the stage, like her film character.\n\nIn 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture \"Who's That Girl\", then known as \"Slammer\". Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, with whom she had written and produced her third studio album \"True Blue\" in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday, as Leonard developed the chorus of the songs. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the songs, while Leonard worked on the other parts. The uptempo song developed was \"Who's That Girl\", the first single from the soundtrack, and the downtempo song, developed and written the day after, was \"The Look of Love\". Madonna later changed the film's name from \"Slammer\" to \"Who's That Girl\", preferring the latter. Regarding the development of the songs for the film, Madonna further explained\n\n\"I had some very specific ideas in mind, music that would stand on its own as well as support and enhance what was happening on screen and the only way to make that a reality was to have a hand in writing the tunes myself. [...] The songs aren't necessarily about Nikki [her character name in the movie] or written to be sung by someone like her, but there's a spirit to this music that captures both what the film and the characters are about, I think.\"\n\nMadonna was inspired by the look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film \"Rear Window\". Madonna said: \"I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating.\" \"The Look of Love\" was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. \"I Know It\", a track from Madonna's self-titled debut album, appeared as the B-side. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the \"Express Yourself\" single release.\n\n\"The Look of Love\" starts off with a low bass synth line and a slow backing track. It is followed by sound of percussion and a high register note, contrasting with the bassline. The song continues in this way up till the last verse, which is backed by the sound from an acoustic guitar. A two-part vocal is found in the line \"No where to run, no place to hide\". According to Rikky Rooksby, author of \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\", Madonna's voice sounds \"expressive\" when she sings the line \"From the look of love\" and utters the word \"look\" over the D minor chord present underneath. The word is sung in a higher note of the musical scale, thus giving an impression of the suspension like quality of the minor ninth chord, dissociating it from the harmony of the other notes. The song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's voice spanning the notes C to B. \"The Look of Love\" has a basic sequence of C–Dm–Fm–B as its chord progression.\n\nRooksby called the song as \"the other gem\" of the \"Who's That Girl\" soundtrack along with \"Causing a Commotion,\" and denoted it as \"an expressive, understated track.\" J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of \"Madonna: An Intimate Biography\", commented that \"'The Look of Love' was an exotic ballad.\" Don Shewey from \"Rolling Stone\" said that the song was \"so haunting that it would leave you thinking as to where your life is going.\" John Evan Seery, author of \"Political theory for mortals: shades of justice, images of death\", commented that the song portrayed Madonna's \"discipline of gaze\". Brian Hadden from \"Time\" found the song depressing. Tiju Francis from \"Vibe\" wrote: \"For a such a commonly titled song, Madonna’s take does at least offer something a little different. [...] 'The Look of Love' actually sounds like part of the score – Madonna could well be singing over what was previously just the moody character development background synth music apparently present in every film in the ’80s. [...] But its slow-burn feel means the song is four minutes of not-particularly-intense brooding that never peaks – unlike a ballad.\" In August 2018, \"Billboard\" ranked it as the singer's 94th greatest song; Andrew Unterberger opined that its \"aqueous production and mysterious melody give it an eerie quality befitting that inspiration, one of Madonna's most bewitching soundtrack compositions\". \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers called it \"an occasionally interesting tide of tropical sounds\". \"Slant Magazine\"s Eric Henderson wrote that \"if Madonna indeed wrote this European single in part as a tribute to James Stewart’s character in \"Rear Window\", it’s impossible not to wish she’d instead opted for a lilting ode to Norman Bates’s mother\".\n\n\"The Look of Love\" was never released in the United States, and therefore did not enter any \"Billboard\" charts. In the United Kingdom, it was released on December 12, 1987, and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 15. The next week, it reached a peak of nine on the chart, her first single to miss the top five since \"Lucky Star\". The song was present for a total of seven weeks on the chart. According to the Official Charts Company, \"The Look of Love\" has sold 121,439 copies in the United Kingdom, as of August 2008. In Germany, the song debuted on the Media Control Charts at number 38 on January 24, 1988 and moved to its peak of number 34, the next week. It was present for a total of seven weeks on the chart. In Ireland, the song reached the top ten and peaked at number six. Across Europe, the song reached number nine in Belgium, number 23 in France, number eight in Netherlands and number 20 in Switzerland. On the European Hot 100 Singles, the song reached number 17.\n\nMadonna performed the song on her 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour. It was the seventh song of the setlist. Madonna was dressed in gold lamé pants and a sleeveless top. As she finished the performance of \"Causing a Commotion\", the spotlight was focused on her. The introductory music of \"The Look of Love\" started and Madonna roamed around the stage, pretending that she was lost. She wanted to portray her \"Who's That Girl\" character Nikki, when she was lost in a similar sequence in the film. After she finished singing the song, Madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through the air, as the conveyor belt took her backwards, ultimately taking her away from the stage.\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n"}

The Wovea are one of the ethnic groups that comprise the Sawa, or Cameroonian coastal peoples.\n\nWovea oral history names a man from the island of Bioko as their forebear. His ship washed ashore at Mboko, the area Southwest of Mount Cameroon, where he married a local woman. They then moved southeast and settled at Ambas Bay. The Wovea likely lived along Ambas Bay in the 17th or 18th century, and they could have participated in the same migration from Mboko that brought the Bakweri and Isubu to their current territories.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Wovea came under the dominance of the Isubu. When the Spanish ousted Protestant missionaries from their base at Fernando Po (modern Bioko) in 1858, the Isubu king, William I of Bimbia, sold part of Wovea territory to British missionary Alfred Saker. The area became Victoria (today known as Limbe), and the Wovea living there were forced to move to Mondole Island. Victoria came to be a mixture of freed slaves, working Sawa, and Christianised Sawa from all the various coastal groups. Cameroonian Pidgin English began to develop at this time.\n\nIn 1905, under German colonial rule, the Wovea were relocated once again to their present home west of the Wouri estuary when Mondole Island became a leper colony. After Germany's defeat in World War I, Wovea territory fell under a British League of Nations mandate.\n\nThe Wovea live south of Mount Cameroon and on the Gulf of Guinea, in the Fako division of the Southwest Province. Their territory lies directly west of that of the Isubu. Fishing is a major form of employment and subsistence.\n\nBobea is the Wovea language. The language had 600 speakers in 1977, although many Wovea speak Duala in lieu of their native tongue. In addition, most Wovea speak Cameroonian Pidgin English or standard English. A growing number of the Anglophones today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.\n\nThe Wovea have been mostly Christianized since the 1970s. Evangelical denominations dominate, particularly the Baptist church.\n\nThe Wovea participate in the Ngondo, a traditional festival of the Duala to which all of Cameroon's coastal Sawa peoples are invited. The main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, pirogue races, and traditional wrestling.\n\nThe Wovea are Bantu in language and origin. More narrowly, they fall into the Sawa, or the coastal peoples of Cameroon.\n\n\n"}

It aired from January 4, 1997 through August 21, 1999 as a syndicated broadcast. \"Shotgun Saturday Night\" was replaced by \"WWF Jakked\" in 1999.\n\nThe show's original concept was unusual for its time; it aired on late Saturday nights from various New York City nightlife locations. The promotion pushed the program as an \"edgier\" product than its normal weekly offerings.\n\n\"Shotgun Saturday Night\" debuted on January 4, 1997 from the Mirage Nightclub (Terminal 5) in New York. One of the most memorable moments of the debut episode occurred when Marlena climbed on the ring apron during a match between Goldust and The Sultan, and removed her top, causing the Sultan to be distracted and lose the match. Though she was wearing pasties, and though her back was facing the camera, this incident was a precursor for the tone of WWF programming for the next several years.\n\nLater episodes of \"Shotgun Saturday Night\" were broadcast from the All-Star Cafe in Times Square, the Mirage Nightclub on Long Island, and New York Penn Station.\n\nThere were several unique elements to the show that did not appear on any other WWF programming at the time. For example, due to the confining nature of the locales it was initially broadcast from, \"Shotgun Saturday Night\" used a somewhat smaller ring than a standard 20-foot by 20-foot WWF ring. All three ring ropes were taped yellow; something that was not replicated until \"NXT\" debuted in 2010.\n\nShortly after the show's debut, the nightclub theme was dropped and the show's matches began being taped in an arena before or after the live Monday Night Raw show. It soon replaced WWF Superstars of Wrestling as the 'B' Show, being used to recap the now two-hour Raw show with original matches featuring lower-level talent.\n\nThe show originally featured commentary by Vince McMahon and Sunny, with Jim Ross and Brian Pillman performing the same duties until mid-1997, when Pillman was pulled from commentary after beating up a (planted) fan on the June 28, 1997 episode. Kevin Kelly, Michael Cole, Jim Cornette and Vince Russo also served as commentators. Stone Cold Steve Austin also served as a surprise guest commentator on one episode along with Owen Hart.\n\nThe WWF also aired a similar syndicated show at the time called \"WWF Shotgun Challenge\", which aired in earlier time slots (replacing \"WWF Challenge\") and was more family-friendly. This version of the show was later renamed simply \"WWF Shotgun\" and ultimately replaced with \"WWF Metal\" in 1999. From 1997 until 1999, matches from \"WWF Shotgun\" were aired on the international version of \"WWF Superstars\" with commentary by Michael Cole and Kevin Kelly, and in January 1999, Gorilla Monsoon joined them.\n\nIn the New York media market, the show was rebranded as \"WWF New York\" in 1997 and 1998, airing on WPIX and WPXN-TV, and later WLNY. It was shown late at night, airing at 2:00 a.m., Eastern time (WPXN aired the series on Saturday mornings).\n\nIn March 1998, the WWF aired \"11:Alive\" which aired the matches in the same order as \"WWF New York\", but with different commentary that made fewer references to New York. The show aired on Saturday mornings and only ran four episodes before being discontinued. The final episode was hosted by Michael Hayes as a preview show to WrestleMania XIV.\n"}

{"id": "2280682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280682", "title": "History of the French Navy", "text": "History of the French Navy\n\nAlthough the history of the French Navy goes back to the Middle Ages, its history can be said to effectively begin with Richelieu under Louis XIII.\n\nSince the establishment of her present territory, France had to face three major challenges on the naval level: \n\nThe history of the French Navy can be divided into the following eras:\n\nThe French Navy is affectionately known as \"La Royale\" (\"the Royal\"). The reason is not well known: it might be for its traditional attachment to the French monarchy; because, before being named \"nationale\", the Navy had been named \"royale\" (the navy did not sport the royal titles common with other European navies like the British Royal Navy); or simply because of the location of its headquarters, \"rue Royale\" in Paris.\n\nMedieval fleets, in France as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. But the early beginning of the French Navy goes back to the Middle Ages, when it defeated the English Navy at the Battle of Arnemuiden, on 23 September 1338. The Battle of Arnemuiden was also the first naval battle using artillery.\n\nDuring the reign of Henry IV, France was in an unstable state, and striving to guarantee her independence from Spanish and papal influences. This prompted both an emphasis on land forces, which drained resources, and an alliance with England, which would have unfavourably seen France challenging her naval supremacy.\n\nWhen Richelieu became Minister of the Navy, he decided on a plan to rebuild a powerful navy, divided into two distinct forces.\n\nThe Mediterranean force was to be completely composed of galleys, to take advantage of the relatively calm sea. Initially, the plan called for 40 galleys, but was downsized to 24 of them, notably because of a lack of galley slaves — each galley was 400 or 500 slave strong.\n\nThe oceanic force was to be composed of men-of-war. The designs were moderately large ships, for a lack of harbours fit for very large units, but very heavily armed with large calibre guns; these ships displaced between 300 and 2000 tonnes and bore up to 50 24-pound cannons, firing 150mm-round shots. The first ships were ordered from the Dutch, and French production started with the famous , a prestige ship typical of this era.\n\nIn 1627, the Navy was not ready to challenge the English fleet at the Siege of La Rochelle, which led to the construction of a seawall to establish a blockade. Fleets of this period were often largely composed of merchant vessels, hastily loaded with cannons, undercrewed and poorly handled.\n\nWith newly built ships, designed as ships of war and crewed by sailors and trained gunners, fighting experience was gained in the Franco-Spanish War and the Thirty Years' War with notable victories at the Battle of Cádiz (1640) won by France's first Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, son of Marshall Urbain de Maillé-Brézé and nephew of Cardinal Richelieu. The Navy built a French empire, conquering the \"Nouvelle-Guyenne\" (now Acadia), \"Nouvelle France\" (now Canada), Tortuga, Martinique, Guadeloupe, several other islands in the Caribbean, the Bahamas, and Madagascar.\n\nUnder the tutelage of the \"Sun King,\" the French Navy was well financed and equipped, managing to score several early victories in the Nine Years' War against the Royal Navy and the Dutch Navy. Financial troubles, however, forced the navy back to port and allowed the English and the Dutch to regain the initiative.\n\nUnder the impulsion of Jean-Baptiste Colbert's ambitious policy of ship building, the French Navy began to gain a magnificence matching the symbolism of the Louis XIV era, as well as an actual military significance. The ship of the line is illustrative of the trend of the time. Colbert is credited with forging a good part of the naval tradition of France.\n\nThe French Navy of this period was also in the forefront of the development of naval tactics. Paul Hoste (1652–1700) produced the first major work on naval tactics.\n\nBefore the Nine Years' War, in the Franco-Dutch War, the French Navy managed to score a decisive victory over a combined Spanish-Dutch fleet at the Battle of Palermo (1676).\n\nDuring the War of the Grand Alliance, Admiral Tourville won a decisive victory in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690, \"Bataille de Bévezier\"). France gained control of the English Channel. The event is regarded as one of the most glorious deeds of the French Navy, and Tourville earned a fame which lasts to present times (a number of ships were named \"Bévezier\" or to commemorate the battle).\n\nThe Battle of Barfleur in 1692 saw a French fleet attack and defeat the combined English and Dutch fleets, despite being heavily outnumbered. The French fought a magnificent fight against odds of more than two to one for twelve hours. They sunk one English ship and one Dutchman and had not lost a ship of their own, although all vessels on both sides were very battered. However, once wind and tide changed, the French suffered heavily as they tried to get back to port for repairs. Some of the damaged French ships were forced to beach themselves at Cherbourg, where they were annihilated by English long boats and with fire ships. The crews were saved, but the lost fifteen ships of the line were not replaced and France did not seriously challenge the combined English and Dutch fleet for decades.\n\nFrance turned to commerce-raiding rather than large fleet actions with great success under such captains as Jean Bart, Claude de Forbin and René Duguay-Trouin.\n\nUntil what the British called the Annus Mirabilis of 1759, the French and British navies had a roughly even record of success in their many conflicts. This changed decisively in that year with a series of disasters for the French, who had begun the year planning an invasion of Britain. The British responded by blockading the French fleets at both Toulon and Brest; when the French emerged they were decisively defeated in the battles of Lagos and Quiberon Bay. The French Navy was also unable to prevent the loss of the important colonies of New France (Quebec) and Guadeloupe. The year marked the beginning of the period of clear British dominance on the seas.\n\nFollowing the disasters of the Seven Years' War, France was financially incapable of building up a fleet to challenge Britain's Royal Navy. However, efforts were made, and by the time of Louis XV's death in 1774, the \"Marine Royale\" was somewhat larger than it had been in 1763, and, crucially, had replaced numerous old vessels with more effective modern designs. Also worthy of note- in 1766, Bougainville led the first French circumnavigation of the world.\n\nKing Louis XVI was keen on technical subjects and geography, and encouraged explorations including the commissioning of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse to undertake far reaching voyages of discovery. (L’expédition de Lapérouse, 1785–1788, réplique française au voyage de Cook). Upon King Louis XVI's orders, Lapérouse departed Brest, France, in command of \"L'Astrolabe\" and \"La Boussole\" on 1 August 1785 on a scientific voyage of the Pacific inspired by the voyages of James Cook. He never returned and his ships were later found wrecked at the island of Vanikoro, which is part of the isolated Santa Cruz group of islands in the South Pacific. Vessels designed by French engineer Jacques-Noël Sané started being constructed during the American Revolutionary War. He created what were to be, in effect, the ultimate designs of wind-powered fighting ship, with standard frigates carrying 18-pounder guns, and standard ships of the line of 64, 74, 80 and 118 guns ; his 74-gun ship of the line became the backbone of the French and English navies. The largest units, the 118-guns, were said to be \"as manoeuvrable as a frigate\" (the is a typical example).\nDuring the American War of Independence the French Navy played a decisive role in supporting the American side. The French Navy was the only standing navy to fight the British, alongside the modest Continental and American state navies and American privateers. In a very impressive effort, the French under de Grasse managed to defeat an English fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, thus ensuring that the Franco-American ground forces would win the ongoing Battle of Yorktown.\n\nIn India, Suffren managed impressive campaigns against the British (1770–1780), successfully contending for supremacy against Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes.\n\nIn 1789, the French Navy counted 71 ships of the line, 64 frigates, 45 corvettes and 32 smaller units; 12 ships of the line and 10 frigates were under construction and expected to be launched within the year. The crews counted 75,000 sailors, 5,000 gunners, 2,000 officers and \n14,000 \"Fusiliers Marins\". Ships were based mostly in Brest, Toulon and Rochefort, as well as in Lorient, Le Havre, Dunkerque, Bordeaux, Bayonne and Marseille.\n\nThe French Revolution, in eliminating numerous officers of noble lineage (among them, Charles d'Estaing), all but crippled the French Navy.\n\nThe National Convention dissolved the Fleet Gunners Corps, which effectively put a halt to the training in gunnery, abysmally degrading the rate of fire and precision of batteries; in addition, the French doctrine was to fire at the rigging of enemy ships as to render them hapless; this doctrine could prove effective with highly trained crews, but was impractical with poorly trained gunners, and resulted in a number of instances where French ships did not manage to score a single hit on dangerously exposed English ships (as happened with the fight of the , or at the beginning of the Battle of Trafalgar). By contrast, the Royal Navy doctrine was to fire at the ship's hull in order to kill and maim the crew, and gradually degrade the firepower of their opponents — also much easier target for much better trained gunners.\n\nEfforts to make it into a powerful force under Napoleon were dashed by the death of Latouche Tréville in 1804, and the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British all but annihilated a combined Franco-Spanish fleet. The disaster guaranteed British naval domination until the steam era.\n\nFrom then on, the French Navy was limited to frigate actions and privateers like Robert Surcouf. This started the French tendency to prefer large numbers of smaller but powerful and swift units, rather than large capital ships.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the navy recovered to become the second finest in the world after the Royal Navy.\n\nDuring this period, explorer and naval officer Dumont d'Urville contributed to geography in Southern and Western Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica, and brought back previously unknown plants and animal species.\n\nThe French Navy also conducted a successful blockade of Mexico in the Pastry War of 1838 and obliterated the Imperial Chinese Navy at the Battle of Fuzhou in 1884. It also served as an effective link between the growing parts of the French empire. Ever eager to challenge British naval supremacy, the French Navy took a leadership role in many areas of warship development, first with incremental improvements upon existing designs with the Commission de Paris, but also pioneering the introduction of several new technologies: steam propulsion, adoption of the screw propeller, adoption of armour plate protection, steel construction, and protected gun mounts.\nIn a speech in 1852, Napoleon III famously proclaimed that \"The Empire means peace\" (\"\"L'Empire, c'est la paix\"\"), but actually he was thoroughly determined to follow a strong foreign policy to extend France's power and glory. The French Navy was involved in a multitude of actions around the world.\n\nNapoleon's challenge to Russia's claims to influence in the Ottoman Empire led to France's successful participation in the Crimean War (March 1854–March 1856). During this war Napoleon successfully established a French alliance with Britain, which continued after the war's close.\n\nThe French line-of-battle ship and the corvette \"Pluton\" ran aground after a storm that destroyed many Allied ships. The remains of \"Henri IV\" were used to construct a fortress. The \"Pluton\" was a total loss.\n\nNapoleon took the first steps to establishing a French colonial influence in Indochina. He approved the launching of a naval expedition in 1858 to punish the Vietnamese for their mistreatment of French Catholic missionaries and force the court to accept a French presence in the country. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Also, the idea that France had a civilizing mission was spreading. This eventually led to a full-out invasion in 1861. By 1862 the war was over and Vietnam conceded three provinces in the south, called by the French Cochinchina, opened three ports to French trade, allowed free passage of French warships to Cambodia (which led to a French protectorate over Cambodia in 1867), allowed freedom of action for French missionaries and gave France a large indemnity for the cost of the war.\n\nIn China, France took part in the Second Opium War along with Great Britain, and in 1860 French troops entered Beijing. China was forced to concede more trading rights, allow freedom of navigation of the Yangtze river, give full civil rights and freedom of religion to Christians, and give France and Britain a huge indemnity. This combined with the intervention in Vietnam set the stage for further French influence in China leading up to a sphere of influence over parts of Southern China.\n\nIn 1866, French Navy troops made an attempt to colonize Korea, during the French campaign against Korea. The French Navy also had a mild presence in Japan in 1867–1868, around the actions of French military mission to Japan, and the subsequent Boshin War.\n\nThe French Navy was heavily involved in French intervention in Mexico (January 1862–March 1867). Napoleon, using as a pretext the Mexican Republic's refusal to pay its foreign debts, planned to establish a French sphere of influence in North America by creating a French-backed monarchy in Mexico, a project which was supported by Mexican conservatives tired of the anti-clerical Mexican republic.\n\nIn the 1880s, the \"Jeune École\" doctrine had a more powerful influence within the French Navy than elsewhere. Derived from the traditions of privateer warfare, the \"Jeune École\" emphasised small, maneuverable craft such as torpedo boats and cruisers carrying shell guns, and prematurely deemed the battleship obsolete. However, in the early 1890s the pre-dreadnought battleship revived with surprising vigour and new protections against torpedoes and mines, and the torpedo boats proved to have inadequate nautical qualities for the open ocean.\n\nFrench capital ships of this time were instantly identifiable by their small size (10,000 tons), huge spur rams, great height and pronounced tumble-home. Often carrying only half the main armament of their British contemporaries, French battleships had armoured masts with electric elevators inside, outsized funnels, and elaborate davit systems to swing out boats from the narrow upper decks.\n\nFrance built a considerable fleet of these vessels, though seldom with such uniform class characteristics as seen in Britain and Germany. The , , and were built as \"sample battleships\", as the design for a true class of battleships was fiddled with. It eventually materialised with the 3-ship , which introduced armament nearly on a par with its British contemporaries.\n\nFrance's conceptual and technological edge proved attractive to the newly industrialising Japan, when the French engineer Émile Bertin was invited for four years to design a new fleet for the Imperial Japanese Navy, which led to her success in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. French yards busily turned out warships for foreign customers, especially Imperial Russia, which copied French stylings in designing many of its cruisers and battleships. Despite her leads in some areas of technology (boilers, metallurgy), France did not have the productive capacity of her rival across the Channel, or her new nemesis, Germany.\n\nRight at the turn of the century, French design absorbed influences from foreign practice. Her newer battleships featured two twin 300mm gun turrets as opposed to single mounts, less exaggerated tumble-home of the hull, and abandonment of the ram bow. This led to improved seakeeping characteristics, though the ships remained small.\n\nIn the (completed 1907), French pre-dreadnought design finally caught up with U.S. and British standards; but 1907 also saw the debut of , which made all the world's capital ships obsolete overnight. Through 1911, while rival navies were turning out new dreadnoughts, all France's available shipyards were dedicated to producing the 6-ship pre-dreadnoughts which, though they featured turbine/quad screw propulsion, still mounted only 4 heavy guns each, as against at least 10 for a dreadnought.\n\nThe first French dreadnoughts did not appear until 1914, and two classes totalling 7 ships, the and es, were completed during World War I. With the alliance with Britain, France's naval assets were concentrated in the Mediterranean, largely to face off the Austro-Hungarian fleet in the Adriatic Sea. Meanwhile, a large cruiser fleet was also built, seeing service in the Mediterranean, the Channel, and in France's imperial dominions in Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe development of the French Navy slowed down in the beginning of the 20th century, and as a result, it was outnumbered by the German and US Navies. It was late to introduce new battleships—dreadnoughts and light cruisers and it entered the First World War with relatively few modern vessels: only one dreadnought in commission at war's start, though all four \"Courbet\"s by the end of 1914 and the 3 improved dreadnoughts by mid-1916. During the war, the main French effort was on land. While capital ships already on the ways were completed, few new warships were laid down. Despite its dated roster, the Marine Nationale performed well in World War I. The main operation of the French Navy was the Dardanelles Campaign. France's most significant losses during the war were four pre-dreadnought battleships, victims of mines and U-boat torpedoes.\n\nA number of major ships of the French Navy at the outbreak / end of World War I:\n\nThe invention of the seaplane in 1910 with the French Fabre Hydravion led to the earliest development of ships designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats. In 1911 appears the French Navy , the first seaplane carrier. She was commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carried float-equipped planes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane. \"Foudre\" was further modified in November 1913 with a 10-metre flat deck to launch her seaplanes.\n\nAs heavier-than-air aircraft developed in the early 20th century various navies began to take an interest in their potential use as scouts for their big gun warships. In 1909 the French inventor Clément Ader published in his book \"L'Aviation Militaire\" the description of a ship to operate airplanes at sea, with a flat flight deck, an island superstructure, deck elevators and a hangar bay. That year the US Naval Attaché in Paris sent a report on his observations and the first experiments to test the concept were made in the United States from 1910.\n\nEvery naval fleet consists of a variety of ships of different sizes, and no fleet has enough resources to make every vessel supreme in its class. Nonetheless, different countries strive to excel in particular classes. Between the world wars, the French fleet was remarkable in its building of small numbers of ships that were \"over the top\" with relation to their equivalents of other powers.\n\nFor example, the French chose to build \"super-destroyers\" which were deemed during World War II by the Allies as the equivalent of light cruisers. This was a way of bypassing the Treaty of Washington, which imposed restrictions on cruisers and battleships, but not on destroyers and smaller units. The of destroyer is still the world's fastest class of destroyer. The submarine was the largest and most powerful of its day.\n\nIn 1933, the French Navy was considering building a super-battleship, the , but the plans were canceled when the Germans came out with the so-called \"pocket battleships\" ; the French responded with a class of two ships of the type, a fast battleship class falling somewhere in between battlecruisers and battleships. The large battleship niche was filled with the .\n\nAt the outset of the war, the French Navy participated in a number of operations against the Axis powers, patrolling the Atlantic and bombarding Genoa. The French surrender and its armistice terms, however, completely changed the situation: the French fleet immediately withdrew from the fight.\n\nThe British perceived the French fleet as a potentially lethal threat, should the French become formal enemies or, more likely, should Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\" gain control. It was essential that they should be put out of action. Some vessels were in British-controlled ports in Britain or Egypt and these were either persuaded to re-join the Allies as Free French ships or were boarded and disarmed.\n\nAn important part of the fleet, however, was in Dakar or Mers-el-Kebir. The Royal Navy delivered an ultimatum but, when agreement proved impossible, they opened fire and sunk or damaged much of the French fleet (Operation Catapult) on 3 July 1940. The action soured Anglo-French relations and inhibited further defections to the Allies. From this point on, the ships remaining in Vichyst hands spent the war trying to observe neutrality towards the Axis powers, while avoiding destructions or capture by the Allies and the Free French. They obtained anecdotical tactical successes which weighted for nought against the overall strategic disaster, like the Battle of Dakar or the Battle of Ko Chang.\n\nIn November, 1942, the Allies invaded French North Africa. In response, the Germans occupied (Case Anton) Vichy France, including the French naval port of Toulon, where the main part of the surviving French fleet lay. This was a major German objective and forces under SS command had been detailed to capture them (Operation \"Lila\"). French naval authorities were divided on their response: Admiral Jean de Laborde, the commander of the Forces de Haute Mer (the High Seas Fleet) advocated sailing to attack the Allied invasion fleet while others, such as the Vichy Secretary of the Navy, Contre-Amiral Gabriel Auphan favoured joining the Allies. On several warships, there were spontaneous demonstrations in favour of sailing with the Allies, chanting \"\"Vive de Gaulle! Appareillage!\"\".\n\nThe orders to French commanders to scuttle their ships in case of an attempted take-over had been reinforced, however, and, often despite the presence of German troops, this was done, in the scuttling of the French fleet at Toulon. No capital ships and few others were taken in reparable condition. A few ships fled Toulon and joined the Allies, notably the submarine .\n\nIn the wake of the Armistice and the Appeal of 18 June, Charles de Gaulle founded the Free French Forces, including a naval arm, the Free Naval French Forces (\"Forces navales françaises libres\", FNFL). To distinguish the FNFL from the Vichist forces, Vice-Admiral Émile Muselier created the bow flag displaying the French colours with a red cross of Lorraine, and a cocarde also featuring the cross of Lorraine for aircraft.\n\nThe French fleet was widely dispersed. Some vessels were in port in France; others had escaped from France to British controlled ports, mainly in Britain itself or Alexandria in Egypt. At the first stage of Operation Catapult, the ships in the British ports of Plymouth and Portsmouth were simply boarded on the night of 3 July 1940. The then-largest submarine in the world, the , which had sought refuge in Portsmouth in June 1940 following the German invasion of France, resisted the British operation. In capturing the submarine, two British officers and one French sailor were killed. Other ships were the two obsolete battleships and , the destroyers and the , 8 torpedo boats, 5 submarines and a number of other ships of lesser importance.\n\nMost of these ships were surrendered to the FNFL (notably the submarine \"Surcouf\"), and other were leased by the British (like the corvette ), constituting the embryo of a naval force.\n\nWhen French Africa joined the Allies, important ships based in Dakar were obtained (notably the cruisers , , , , and the battleship ).\n\nBeside warships, the FNFL developed special forces: Captain Philippe Kieffer took inspiration from the British commandos to train new units of \"\"Commandos Fusiliers-Marins\"\", which later would become the \"Commandos Marine\". These commandos distinguished themselves during Battle of Normandy, climbing cliffs under fire to destroy German shore batteries. Captain Henri Honoré d'Estienne d'Orves attempted to unite the French Resistance, became an inspiring symbol when he was arrested, tortured by the Gestapo and executed.\n\nThe FNFL also harboured technical innovators, like Captain Jacques Cousteau, who invented the modern aqua-lung, and Yves Rocard, who perfected the radar. The aqua-lung became a major improvement for commando operations.\n\nFrench warships of the FNFL supported the landings in southern France (Operation Dragoon) and Normandy (Operation Neptune). These units also played their parts in the war in the Pacific. The \"Richelieu\" was present in Tokyo Bay during the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.\n\nFrench naval doctrine calls for two aircraft carriers, but the French only have one, the .\n\nThe navy is in the midst of major technological and procurement changes. A naval version of the Rafale is replacing older aircraft. Newer strategic submarines of the SNLE-NG type have mostly replaced the elder SNLE, and a new nuclear ballistic missile is under test, due for 2008. The experience acquired with the building of the SNLE-NG will also lead to a newer type of nuclear attack submarines, which are expected for 2017. Surface forces are upgrading in numbers and modernity, with two large destroyers and 11 frigates planned. More modern missiles are being issued, notably adding cruise missile capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pepin removed Grifo and installed the young Tassilo as duke, but under Frankish overlordship.\n\nThen, in 757, according to the Royal Frankish Annals, Tassilo became Pepin’s vassal and the lord for his lands at an assembly held at Compiegne. There, he is reported to have sworn numerous oaths to Pepin and, according to reports that may have been written much later, promised fealty to him and his sons, Charles and Carloman. However, the highly legalistic account is quite out of character for the period. K. L. Pearson has suggested that it probably represents a reworking of the original document by the annalist to emphasise Charlemagne's overlordship over Tassilo during the period of hostilities between the two rulers.\n\nAround 760, Tassilo married Liutperga, daughter of the Lombard king, Desiderius, continuing a tradition of Lombardo-Bavarian connections. He made several journeys to Italy to visit his father in law and to establish political relations with the pope. It is reported that Tassilo had gained such a reputation that he was regarded as a kingly ruler when his cousins Charles and Carloman assumed power in the Frankish realm in 768.\nThat year, he founded Gars Abbey on the Inn River, in southern Bavaria.\nHe was, however, not able to protect the pope against Lombard expansions, which has been seen as a reason for Rome's lack of support for him during his later conflict with Charlemagne. Still, there is a consensus among historians that Tassilo, despite acting as a kingly sovereign, did not intend to become king himself.\n\nTassilo nevertheless undertook such kingly duties as founding Kremsmünster Abbey. According to legend, Tassilo discovered the body of his son, Gunther, who had been attacked by a wild boar during a hunt. In grief, he founded the monastery on the site in 777.\n\nIn 763 Tassilo was accused by the Franks of defaulting on his military obligations to Pepin, leaving the Frankish campaign in Aquitaine on grounds of ill health. Pearson suggests that he left because he felt an obligation to the Aquitanians in light of an earlier alliance, made between Tassilo’s father and the Aquitanian duke during his conflict with Pepin in 743. Whatever the motivations behind Tassilo's abandonment of the campaign, the Royal Frankish Annals for that year are particularly scathing of him, saying that he \"brushed aside his oaths and all his promises and sneaked away on a wicked pretext\". Working on the premise that the annals may have been revised to emphasise Tassilo as a vassal, Pearson suggests that to be the beginning of a campaign to depict Tassilo as an oath-breaker and someone unprepared to carry out the main function of his office, to fight, which would make him unfit for rule.\n\nThe incident was the linchpin in Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I's argument that Tassilo was not an independent prince but a rebellious vassal, deserving punishment. The punishment was carried out, after much political maneuvering, during a diet in the Imperial Palace Ingelheim in 788, when Tassilo was finally deposed and then entered a monastery. In 794, Tassilo was again compelled, at the synod of Frankfurt, to renounce his and his family's claims to Bavaria. He formally handed over to the king all of the rights that he had held. \n"}
{"id": "2280724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280724", "title": "1987 Tour de France", "text": "1987 Tour de France\n\nThe 1987 Tour de France was the 74th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 1 to 26 July. It consisted of 25 stages over . It was the closest three-way finish in the Tour until the 2007 Tour de France, among the closest overall races in Tour history and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th place riders each wore the Yellow jersey at some point during the race. It was won by Stephen Roche, the first and so far only Irishman to do so.\n\nThe winner of the 1986 Tour de France, Greg LeMond was unable to defend his title following a shooting accident in April.\n\nFollowing Stage 1, Poland's Lech Piasecki became the first rider from the Eastern Bloc to lead the Tour de France. He was one of eight different men to wear yellow, a new record for the Tour.\n\nThe number of cyclists in one team was reduced from 10 to 9, to allow more teams in the race. The 1987 Tour started with 207 cyclists, divided into 23 teams. Of these, 62 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The average age of riders in the race was 27.05 years, ranging from the 20-year-old Jean-Claude Colotti () to the 36-year-old Gerrie Knetemann (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nShortly before the Tour, on 20 April 1987, the defending champion Greg LeMond was accidentally shot by his brother-in-law while hunting turkeys. He was unable to start the 1987 Tour, and because Bernard Hinault (second placed in 1986, and the only rider to seriously challenge LeMond in 1986) had retired, the Tour started without a clear favourite.\n\nOnly one previous winner started in the 1987 Tour: Laurent Fignon, winner in 1983 and 1984. Since then, Fignon had struggled with his form, but in the first months of 1987, Fignon had finally shown some good results. LeMond's place as leader of the Toshiba team was now taken by Jean-François Bernard. He had finished in twelfth place in the previous year as helper of LeMond and Hinault, so more was expected from him now. The Carrera team was led by Stephen Roche. For Roche, the months before the 1987 Tour had gone well, having won the 1987 Giro d'Italia. In the recent Tours, Pedro Delgado had shown improving results, and he had some talented helpers in his PDM team, so he was also considered a contender.\n\nIn 1985, it was announced that the 1987 Tour would start in West-Berlin, to celebrate that it was 750 years ago that the city was founded. The 1987 Tour de France started on 1 July, and had one rest day, in Avignon. There were 25 stages (and a prologue), more than ever before. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 21.\n\nThe prologue was won by specialist Jelle Nijdam, and none of the favourites lost much time. The second place in the prologue was for Polish cyclist Lech Piasecki, and when he was part of a break-away in the first stage that won a few seconds, he became the new leader in the general classification, the first time that an Eastern-European cyclist lead the Tour de France. Piasecki kept his lead in the team time trial of stage 2, but lost it in the third stage when a break-away gained several minutes. Erich Maechler became the new leader.\nMaechler kept the lead for several stages. After stage nine, Maechler was still leading. The mass-start stages were dominated by break-aways of cyclists who were not considered relevant for the final victory; sixth-placed Charly Mottet was the only cyclist in the top 15 who had real chances of finishing high.\n\nThe tenth stage was an individual time trial, and the first real test for the favourites. It was won by Stephen Roche, with Mottet in second place; Mottet became the new leader of the general classification. After a successful escape in the eleventh stage, Martial Gayant became the new leader. The twelfth stage ended in a bunch sprint that did not change the general classification. The Tour arrived in the Pyrenees in the thirteenth stage. Non-climbers, such as Gayant lost more than fifteen minutes, and so the non-climbers were removed from the top positions of the general classification; the new top three was Mottet – Bernard – Roche, all serious contenders for the final victory.\n\nThe eighteenth stage was an individual time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux. It was won with a great margin by Jean-François Bernard, who became the new leader of the general classification, and the new hope of the French cycling fans. Bernard was a good climber and a good time-trialist, and had the support of a good team, so he could be able to stay leader until the end of the race. But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the feed zone, where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche had packed extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get back to them, and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.\n\nIn the twentieth stage, the riders went through the Alps, to finish on the Alpe d'Huez. Roche finished in fifteenth place, and lost the lead to Delgado. The pivotal stage was stage 21. In the first part of this stage, the Colombian cyclists of the \"Cafe de Colombia\" team (including Luis Herrera and Fabio Parra, fifth and sixth in the general classification) kept a high pace, and many cyclists were dropped. Roche, Delgado and Mottet decided to work together to get rid of the Colombian cyclists on the descent of the Galibier, out of fear that Herrera and Parra would leave them behind in the next climbs. Their plan worked, but Delgado's teammates were also dropped. Roche saw this opportunity and escaped, climbing the Madeleine in a small breakaway group.\nSomewhat later, Delgado's teammates got back to Delgado, and together they chased Roche, and caught him just before the climb of La Plagne. Roche then anticipated that Delgado would keep attacking on the climb. Knowing Delgado was the better climber, Roche decided he would not follow Delgado's attack. Instead, he let Delgado get away until the margin was one minute, giving Delgado the impression that he could safely save energy for the next stages, and at the last part of the stage gave it everything he had to reduce the margin. Roche followed that tactic, and confused not only Delgado, but also the commentators and the Tour organisation. Roche finished a few seconds behind Delgado, and after the finish he collapsed and was given an oxygen mask in an ambulance.\n\nRoche was only 39 seconds behind Delgado in the general classification. Roche could still win the Tour, but it depended on if he could recover in time for the 22nd stage. That stage included the last serious climb of the Tour, so Delgado had his final opportunity to gain time on Roche, and he attacked. However, Roche was able to come back to Delgado twice. Then, Roche attacked, and Delgado could not keep up. Roche won back 18 seconds on Delgado, so he had reduced his margin to 21 seconds. Being a talented time-trialist, he knew that he could easily make up for it on the penultimate stage (an individual time trial at Dijon). Indeed, Roche won almost a minute on Delgado, and this was enough to secure the overall win. This time trial was won by Jean-François Bernard finished the Tour in third place after losing four minutes after the flat tire in the nineteenth stage.\n\nBontempi was originally declared winner of the 7th stage, but a few days later, his doping test came back positive for testosterone. Bontempi was set back to the last place of the stage, was penalised with 10 minutes in the general classification, and received a provisional suspension of one month.\n\nOne day later, it became public that Dietrich Thurau had tested positive after the eighth stage. At that point, Thurau had already left the race. He was set back to the last place of that stage, and also received a provisional suspension of one month.\n\nThe third rider to test positive was Silvano Contini, after the thirteenth stage. He received the same penalty.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1987 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThere was also a combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the combination jersey.\n\nAnother classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey.\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey. In 1987 the race organisers changed the rules for the young rider classification; from 1983 to 1986, this classification had been as a \"debutant classification\", open for cyclist that rode the Tour for the first time. In 1987, the organisers decided that the classification should be open to all cyclists less than 25 years of age at 1 January of the year.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each mass-start stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Régis Clère won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 21. This prize was won by Pedro Muñoz.\n\n\nAfter the Giro-Tour double victory, Roche would complete the Triple Crown of Cycling by winning the 1987 road race world championship.\n\nJeff Pierce winning the final stage on the Champs-Élysées is thought to have impressed the presence of United States cycling in the European circuit. \"Cycling News\"'s Pat Malach wrote that Pierce's win was his defining win for the remainder of his career.\n\n\n"}

It is 31 km to Kochi and Kottayam and 22 km north of Alappuzha town, on the Kochi-Alappuzha National Highway NH 47, as well as the coastal rail route. The coastal town is also about 20 kilometers from the historical town of Vaikom Via Ullala -Chempakassery house and the popular tourism destination Kumarakom. \nIn local administration, the Cherthala is a municipality while in the state administrative structure Cherthala is a taluk in the district of Alappuzha. The Corporation of Cochin has drafted a master plan that aims to develop Cherthala as the satellite town around Kochi.\n\nAccording to the local legend, once Vilwamangalam Swamiyar, the well known Kerala Hindu saint, while travelling through Cherthala, found an idol of the Devi with its head immersed in a muddy pond. The swami understood the divinity of the idol, took it out of the mud, cleaned it and consecrated it in a temple near the pond. Thus the place is believed to have gotten its name as \"cher\" meaning \"mud\" and \"thala\" meaning \"head\" in Malayalam. The deity of the temple has the name \"Cherthala Karthiyayani\". The word put together means \"head from the mud\". Unlike in other Kerala temples, the idol of \"Cherthala Karthiyayani\" Devi is consecrated in the Sreekovil just below the ground level and cannot be directly viewed by the devotees.\n\nThere is another story that says that the former name was Karappuram and that this piece of land was given by the erstwhile State of Cochin to the erstwhile state of Travancore for protecting it from enemies. The place got its name as \"chertha\" (\"joined\") \"thala\" (\"abutting land\").\nCherthala taluk is a part of Alappuzha Revenue District and Alappuzha Parliamentary constituency. All the villages of Cherthala Taluk come under the Cherthala and Aroor and Alappuzha(part)Constituencies of Kerala Legislative Assembly. The three-tier local governance structure is as follows: Cherthala Taluk area comes under Alappuzha district \"panchayat\" and the area is divided into three block \"panchayats\": Pattanakad, Thycattuserry and Kanzhikuzhy. These block panchayats are again subdivided into \"Grama panchayats\". The Grama panchayats in Pattanakkad Block Panchayath are Aroor, Ezhupunna, Kuthiathode, Kodamthuruthu, Thuravoor, Pattanakkad and Vayalar. The Thycattussery Block Panchayath have five Grama Panchayaths, viz., Arookutty, Perumbalam, Panavally, Thycattusserry and Chennam Pallippuram. Kadakkarappally, Cherthala South, Kanjikuzhi, Thanneermukkom and Mararikulam North are Grama panchayaths in the Kanjikuzhi block.\n\nAccording to the Kerala government website, Cherthala municipality had a population of 1,43,326 over an area of . The density of the population is 8858.2 per square kilometre. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%.\n\nCherthala has an average literacy rate of 94%, with male literacy of 98.4% and female literacy of 89.7%.\n\n\n\nPerhaps inspired by its illustrious son, Irayimman Thampi, Cherthala has a community of Karnatic music connoisseurs, especially performers, in the older generation as well in the younger generation. Well-known Karnatic singers and instrumentalists include Cherthala Gopalan Nair, Thiruvizha Jayasankar, Thiruvizha Sivanandan, Cherthala K. Narayana Iyer and Cherthala Ranganatha Sarma. Many of the senior artists also have a significant number of disciples in and around Cherthala.\n\nCherthala lies between the Kottapuram-Kollam National Waterway 3 passing through the Vembanad lake. Prior to the coming of NH 66, cargo and freight from Cochin market were transported in country boats through the Vembanad lake via the small lake diverting from Arukutty-Thycattuserry-Vayalar. Now these country boats are no more used for cargo transportation, instead converted into tourist floating houseboats. One can still find the canal running across the center of the town which was once the busiest waterway. One can reach Vaikom by the Thavanakadav-Vaikom ferry service covering approx 3.5 km across the Vembanad lake and joining the Kottayam district at Vaikom jetty. There are small inland waterways or rivers, which flow across the villages, still navigable through county boats. They transport coir, marine products, vegetables, paddy, sand, construction materials, etc. where roads are inaccessible. The majority of these inland rivers flow from Vembanad Lake on the eastern side and merge into the azhi or sea near Anthakaranazhi on the west coast, crossing the NH 66 at different places.\n\nCherthala Town Municipality has 35 wards. The town is well known after the Karthyayani Devi temple, located in the center of the town. Two more sub-temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu are also located on the northern side of the main temple. A sub-temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, also known as Kaavudayan and another dedicated to Kshethrapalakan believed to be Devi's temple caretaker are located on the southern corner of the main temple. Thousands of devotees coming from different 'karas' (localities) of Cherthala participate in the Padayani, vela thullal and pooram pattu, the main rituals conducted during the temple festival. A large pond exists in front of the Taluk office that belongs to the Karthyayani Devi temple. One can see many roosters flocking around the temple premises. These roosters are the offerings of the devotees, an ancient custom followed in many devi temples of Kerala. The temple is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board.\nAnother temple in Cherthala town is the Muttathu Thirumala Devaswam temple. Lord Narasimha presiding in the form of Saligrama and Sree Venkatachalapathy Moorthy with bhoo devi and sree devi are the deities of this temple. The temple conducts its annual festival either ahead of the Karthyayani Devi's festival or soon after that. The Pallivetta is a procession where it is believed that Goddess is going for the divine hunting. The annual festival lasts for eight days.\n\nThere exists a war memorial next to Taluk office dedicated to 112 men from Shertalai who participated in First World War(1914-1918).\n\n\n"}

An 8-bit version of the game was later released for the Master System and Game Gear. The game follows Mickey Mouse on a quest to save Minnie Mouse from the evil witch Mizrabel. It was the first game in Sega's long-running \"Illusion\" video game series starring Mickey and was also a part of the second wave of games initially released for the Sega Genesis which helped seal the console's reputation within the period until the release of \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" in 1991.\n\n\"Castle of Illusion\" was very well received by critics, especially the original 16-bit version. It was re-released in 1998 in Japan as part of the \"Sega Ages: Mickey Mouse & Donald Duck\" for the Sega Saturn, which features both \"Castle of Illusion\" and \"QuackShot\". A remake of the game by Sega Studios Australia was released for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC in September 2013. The game was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019.\n\n\"Castle of Illusion\" is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of Mickey Mouse as he goes inside the Castle of Illusion in order to rescue Minnie Mouse from an evil witch named Mizrabel, who wants to steal Minnie's youth. Upon meeting and conversing with the castle's true owner and king, Mickey is told that in order to defeat Mizrabel he must find the Seven Gems of the Rainbow. Majority of the seven gems are kept within various illusion-filled worlds (known in the game as levels), and are being guarded by Mizrabel's henchmen – which are known as the Masters of Illusion. Alongside the Masters of Illusion are bizarre creatures - such as enchanted mushrooms, toy soldiers, ball-juggling unicycle-riding clowns, and armored knights that Mickey must face. After thanking the castellan and hurrying into the castle hallway, Mickey begins to search through five doors that each lead to a different level. The levels are The Enchanted Forest, Toyland, The Storm, Dessert Factory, The Library, and finally, The Castle.\n\nMickey's main method of attack is to perform a 'bounce' whilst jumping, which can be used to defeat enemies, or to bounce upwards towards higher areas. Mickey can also collect projectiles such as apples and marbles to throw at his opponents. There are various items that earn bonus points, increase the player's health and grant extra tries.\n\nEvery level ends in a boss battle against each Master of Illusion (Mizrabel's henchmen) where Mickey can earn a gem, although the final two levels award a gem half-way through. After clearing all five levels, obtaining all gems will open up the route to the witch's tower. There, the player faces the final boss: a giant and youthful version of Mizrabel (resembling a cross between the Queen and Maleficent). There is also an easy mode available where players simply play through truncated versions of the first three levels, with no boss fights.\n\nThe Master System and Game Gear versions of the game feature different game mechanics, enemies, items, levels and graphics. \n\nThe game was also included on a cartridge entitled \"Disney Collection\", bundled with \"QuackShot\", in 1996. An emulated version of \"Castle of Illusion\" was also included in a bundle for those who preordered its remake on PSN; this bundle was offered again for PlayStation Plus subscribers in April 2014.\n\nAn 8-bit version of the game was released in 1991 for the Master System and Game Gear.\n\nAt the time of the game's release, \"Mean Machines\" gave the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of the game a positive review, awarding the game a score of 95%, specifically praising the games graphics and playability. \"Mega\" placed it at 21st spot in their 1992 list of top Mega Drive games of all time. According to GameSpot in 2010, \"it wasn't just the levels that made this game so good. The music, the controls, and Mickey's superb animation all contributed to one of the very best Disney games that would heavily influence those to follow.\"\n\n\"ACE\" called the Game Gear version \"basically an unadulterated \"Mario\" clone—and not a bad one at that\", giving it a score of eight out of 10.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" picked the game as the #19 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \"Perfect for younger players, but challenging enough to satisfy adults, too. A superbly animated Mickey bops through three different worlds—the Enchanted Forest, Toyland, and the Dessert Factory—in a quest to save Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel.\"\n\nA sequel, \"Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse\", was released for the Master System in 1992 and for the Game Gear in 1993. \"World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck\" followed for the Genesis in 1992. In 1994, \"Legend of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse\" was released for the Game Gear, with a Master System port following in 1998 exclusively in Brazil.\n\n\"\", developed by DreamRift, was released in November 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS and serves as a spiritual successor to \"Castle of Illusion\". In it, Mizrabel from \"Castle of Illusion\" returns as the main villain, but redesigned to resemble Maleficent.\n\nA remake of the game, developed by Sega Studios Australia, was released for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC in September 2013. The game features 2.5D gameplay with 3D graphics and was developed under the supervision of the original game's director, Emiko Yamamoto, with a reimagined soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope.

A fully owned subsidiary of Universal Music Group and distributed by Capitol Music Group's Blue Note Records, the label evolved through an expansion of formats to include world music, jazz, Celtic music, new flamenco, acoustic guitar, and piano genre releases.\n\nIn 1979, John Morey started a mail-order business to sell new-age music. This led to the creation of Narada in Milwaukee in 1983, and the roster eventually included David Arkenstone, Jesse Cook, Michael Gettel, Michael Jones, David Lanz, Oscar Lopez, and Billy McLaughlin. Virgin bought Narada in 1997, along with Higher Octave and Back Porch, and directly signed Yanni and other New Age/Smooth Jazz acts.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, Narada created several sub-label imprints to differentiate its offerings, in particular Sona Gaia, Antiquity Records, Rising Sun Records, Narada World, Narada Equinox, Narada Jazz, and Narada Mystique. Since the acquisition, Narada was the principal U.S. licensee for Peter Gabriel's Real World Records until 2008. The sub-labels of Narada were retired and their albums folded into the company's main imprint, Narada. \n\nShakti Records was created in 2000 for electronic music, but the last release was in 2004 as Narada concentrated on contemporary jazz. Higher Octave and Back Porch were absorbed into Narada in 2004 as sub-labels, without the original staff, significantly reducing their roster of artists and albums.\n\nIn 2005, Narada was named No. 4 in the 2005 top four contemporary jazz labels in \"Billboard\" magazine's year-end charts.\n\nIn 2006, EMI moved Narada from Milwaukee suburb Glendale, Wisconsin to EMI headquarters in New York City, to become part of the expanded role for Blue Note, EMI's consolidated label group for music for adults. Likewise merged in were Mosaic, Capitol Jazz, Roulette Jazz, Pacific Jazz, Manhattan, Angel, and Metro Blue; announced plans were to continue using existing imprints. As part of this consolidation, Narada's involvement with new-age music was reduced with Narada's focus narrowed to mainly contemporary jazz; new-age would be put on sister label Higher Octave.\n\n\n"}

He supports the Earth which he balances on a spinning pole. He receives an annual application of wild duck-oil to his muscles from a servant which brings relief to his muscles. The belief is that when all the ducks are hunted out, there will no longer be any duck-oil available in the world. At this point, Amala dies and the world topples off the pole and comes to an end.\n\nThe name Amala refers to his being very dirty and literally means “smoke hole.” Amala is said to be the youngest child in a family who is physically weak and lazy. He is made to sleep in the ashes and suffers mistreatment from everybody. In many variants of the myth, Amala sleeps in his urine. Late in his life he attains supernatural strength in secret and becomes a handsome, and powerful young man who performs many daring feats and turns savior and protector for his relatives against their enemies. The concluding feat of his life is to succeed a dying chief on an island in the Southwest sea in the task of holding the Earth up. The dying chief hears of Amala's various exploits and, impressed by his prowess, calls the hero. When Amala arrives, the chief hands over the long pole upon which the flat world revolves. Some versions of the myth state that the chief places the pole on Amala's chest, while some versions hold that the pole is held behind Amala's back. A servant relieves Amala's muscles with yearly application of spoonfuls of duck grease and wild-duck oil which help Amala to keep the world spinning.\n\nThere is a possibility that the myths about Amala and similar heroes of Native American mythology were influenced by the tales of Cinderella and Atlas - the titan who carries the world on his shoulder in Greek mythology, introduced into Native American culture from Europe. There is a similarity between Cinderella and Amala in that both sleep in ashes and both are abused by their tribe or family. The storyline of Amala - the despised member of the tribe who overcomes adversity and rises to be a hero among his people, may be a combination of elements of the downtrodden and derided hero or heroine, such as Cinderella, and the hero of the Atlas-type who dwells in the underworld.\n\n"}
{"id": "2280805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280805", "title": "Daylight Again", "text": "Daylight Again\n\nDaylight Again is the seventh album by Crosby, Stills & Nash, and their fourth studio album comprising original material. It peaked at No. 8 on the \"Billboard 200\" albums chart, the final time the band has made the top ten to date. Three singles were released from the album, all making the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"Wasted on the Way\" peaked at No. 9, \"Southern Cross\" at No. 18, and \"Too Much Love to Hide\" at No. 69. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA with sales of 1,850,000.\n\nThe genesis of the album lies in recordings made by Stephen Stills and Graham Nash at intervals in 1980 and 1981 and the album was originally slated to be a Stills–Nash project. They employed Art Garfunkel, Timothy B. Schmit, and others to sing in place of where David Crosby might have been. Executives at Atlantic Records, however, had little interest in anything but CSN product from any member of the group, and held out for the presence of Crosby, forcing Nash and Stills to start paying for the sessions out-of-pocket. They began to turn toward the company's point of view, however, and decided to invite Crosby to participate at the eleventh hour.\n\nCrosby brought two tracks to the album: \"Delta,\" where Stills and Nash squeezed their vocals into Crosby's already-taped multi-tracked harmonies, and \"Might As Well Have a Good Time,\" which received the bona fide Crosby, Stills & Nash treatment. Most of the recording, however, features other voices in addition to the main trio, a first for any CSNY record, as is the number of outside writers. Graham Nash wrote the album's biggest hit, \"Wasted on the Way,\" about the time the group spent in squabbles and diversions rather than concentrating on their music. The second single, \"Southern Cross\", was Stills' partial rewrite of a song by brothers Richard and Michael Curtis. The song \"Daylight Again\" evolved out of Stills' guitar-picking to accompany on-stage stories regarding the South in the Civil War, segueing into \"Find the Cost of Freedom,\" which had been the b-side of the \"Ohio\" single in 1970.\n\n\"Daylight Again\" was the band's first album in the video age, and a video was filmed for \"Southern Cross\" featuring the band and one of their favorite metaphors, a sailing vessel. It received a fair amount of rotation on MTV in 1982 and 1983, and helped to propel the album's sales.\n\nThe album has been released on compact disc on three occasions: an initial time in the 1980s; remastered using the original master tapes by Ocean View Digital and reissued on September 20, 1994; and again remastered using the HDCD process and reissued by Rhino Records on January 24, 2006, with four bonus tracks.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2280811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280811", "title": "Gamestudio", "text": "Gamestudio\n\n3D GameStudio or 3DGS is a pan 3D computer game development system which allows the users to create 3D games and other virtual reality applications, and publish them royalty-free. It includes a model/terrain editor, a level editor, a script editor/debugger and comes with a big collection of textures, models and artwork, as well as a game template system that allows the creation of basic shooter games or RPGs without programming. For complex games or other applications, either the integrated programming language named Lite-C or an external development language such as Visual C++ or Borland Delphi can be used.\n\nGamestudio is marketed at users of various skill levels, providing three different levels of usage (\"beginner\", \"advanced\", and \"professional\") for hobbyists, artists, as well as programmers. Additionally, Conitec also markets the system for uses such as advergame development and the creation of real-time presentations, simulations, and virtual exhibitions. Most published titles made from Gamestudio are created by development teams of only 2 to 3 developers. There is also a large online community of users in support of the development system.\n\n\nFree updates are normally available once every 4 to 8 weeks.\nGamestudio / A8 has 2 different meanings. The Gamestudio part refers to the editors and game template system, but the A8 part refers to the game engine.\n\nThe A8 engine uses panes for physics simulation. The engine automatically updates the game state on all machines when playing over a network, but also provides functions for more low-level multiplayer programming. It uses an ABT (Adaptive Binary Tree) renderer for indoor and outdoor levels, and an additional BSP renderer for indoor levels. The BSP renderer is only available in the Pro edition. The free edition and Extra edition don't support shaders.\n\nThe engine supports high resolutions, terrain rendering, pre-rendered shadow maps and dynamic stencil shadows (single dynamic shadows for models). The 2D system (GUI system) of the A8 Engine is not very powerful (see scripting section), but replaceable using the 3D system if needed. Using Lite-C, most things can be customized. Shader model 3.0 support and post-processing using stages may assist shader programmers in chaining together effects to produce any number of custom-made shader effects.\n\nGamestudio supplies users with an editing suite. However, software like Blender, 3ds Max, Maya and Adobe Photoshop or GIMP can also be used to create professional imagery and models for Gamestudio.\n\nThe editors allow users to put together games by creating a terrain or building environment, inserting models, and adding behaviors to them from template scripts or own scripts. If desired, users can create their own models and designs, textures, and scripts. Textures are created in external paint programs like GIMP, Photoshop, Paintshop Pro or Microsoft Paint.\n\nThe World Editor (or WED for short), is the main editor. With it, the user may position the various objects, assign actions to models (also known as entities) which are defined through scripts, assign textures to level geometry, and build levels using the Binary space partitioning tree (or BSP for short) technique.\n\nWED is the main program of Gamestudio, the user can startup their game from here, attach the scripts to it, etc. WED is the location where the user can merge all the parts of their game (programming, 3d graphics, levels).\n\nThe layout for WED is fairly simple. The main part, the central right section, is where most of the editing is done. There are three graphs and a 3D view. Through re-arrangeable, the top left window is the top view, which has the X and Y coordinates. The bottom left is the side view, or the X and Z coordinates. The bottom right is the back view, or the Y and Z coordinates. The top right is the 3D view, which gives a quick preview of the level without building (compiling) it.\n\nThe graphs are split into multiples of 128 and further split into multiples of 16 to help with snapping and spacing. The graphs will automatically resize when zoomed out a bit and in steps of multiples of 8 (1024 and 128 then 8192 and 1024).\n\nThe left central section lists objects in the level, textures, and some other things. Textures must be of a power of 2 (such as 256×128, 1024×256, or 64×64) for best effects. Odd ones (like 394×213 or 723×1280) look worse and are slower at rendering.\n\nThe top is the tool bar which allows the user to manipulate objects, add new objects (such as entities, sounds, and lights), build a level, run it, and several other options.\n\nWhen right-clicking on something and choosing properties, the user can manually enter a position, assign an action to an entity, or adjust textures on the individual sides of a block.\n\nA disadvantage of WED is its incapability to do anything without blocks or terrain. E.g. it is really hard to build a street (that is not just a plane), because it is nearly impossible to move the blocks in the perfect position, so no \"steps\" or gaps are in the street (it is just not possible to get the edges of the blocks perfectly together, the snap-to-grid-feature helps only when using nearly non-rotated blocks). Triangles or a snap-block-edge-to-block-edge feature would fix that and would make it possible to make a more complex floor out of more than one single block without gaps or steps.\nThough many users prefer to use external modeling programs, the model editor (or MED for short), gives you the capabilities to design models, and is sometimes used to make levels. Models can be made of anything ranging from simple boxes, to human models or complex environments like an entire city. Models are made of meshes, a group of vertices and triangles (often called \"polygons\") put together to form a shape; a skeleton of bones for animation; one or several textures for the skin; and effect files (.fx) for shaders.\n\nLike WED, MED's general layout is almost the same. It has the three graphs and the 3D view. They are arranged in the same way as WED.\n\nMED is somewhat like WED in the general layout, but MED also has a skin editor, which allows the model to be textured. The skin editor has a completely different layout. The texture is shown on the left side and the model is shown on the right with tool bars surrounding these. Textures are frequently created in external graphics editors and imported from a BMP, TGA, or PCX image file. MED uses UV mapping which has vertices from the model's mesh placed on the texture to texture the model.\n\nModel shapes are created either through primitives (like cubes and pyramids) or by creating vertices and building faces. Models don't have to follow the restrictions that BSP has which, along with faster rendering, makes them a better choice for level design in most cases.\nThe script editor, SED, is a plain text editor with a compiler and debugger. However, key words like \"function\", \"alpha\", variable types, or numbers are highlighted in different colors for ease of identification, line numbers help to find syntax errors given by the engine faster, a code jumper allows jumping to different functions, actions and objects, and other functions further assist in programming and organizing projects. The script editor is used to program in Lite-c or C-Script (a scripting language somewhat similar to C used in previous generations but supported for compatibility's sake).\n\nGED is just like WED, but creating levels in realview (realtime). It doesn't support creating blocks or lights, yet. \n\nGamestudio uses two different types of script, C-Script and Lite-C.\n\nC-Script was the old scripting language of Gamestudio. It is still supported, but was replaced by Lite-C in A7 and is not recommended anymore for new projects. C-Script is a simplified version of C programming. It only includes one type of variable, a var, and does not support classes.\n\nLite-C was introduced in 2007. It is similar to the real C language, but includes many aspects that make it easier than C. Unlike C-Script, Lite-C supports the full C/C++ variable set, structs, and external classes, and is compiled instead of interpreted. It offers access to the DirectX command set as well as to the Windows API. Lite-C supports classes from external libraries, but a user cannot define their own classes in Lite-C.\nThere is also a free standalone version of Lite-C, which can be used separately from Gamestudio.\n\nThe Intense X plug-in is designed to assist in creation within Gamestudio without programming, integrating into the level editor. Intense X uses artificial intelligence and pathfinding engines that attempt to remove the “cookie cutter” look that often accompanies other game design packages. Intense X is open source and can be expanded and customized for users with programming experience.\n\nGamestudio has four different editions. All editions come with free updates within an engine version (Free within A8, but not from A7.x to A8.x). They also all come with the model editor, level editor, and script editor. Games created in all editions may be published with the exception of Team editions.\n\n\nThere are three main online magazines which provide new tips, tricks and tutorials. Two of them (3AM and 3PM) are paid for, while the third, Acknex User Magazine (AUM for short) is free, created and published monthly by George Dan Pirvu.\n\nIn addition to the manual, there are several tutorials available ranging from basic things such as how to use WED, MED, and/or SED to more advanced things such as how to design multiplayers levels, editing shades, or creating interactive environments.\n\nA special license term restricts the use of Gamestudio to applications that do not \"propagate genocide against a certain group, race, nation or religion existing in today's real world\".\n\nGames that have used Gamestudio include\n\n"}

The challenge arises from the requirement that the set of qualified users can change in each broadcast emission, and therefore revocation of individual users or user groups should be possible using broadcast transmissions, only, and without affecting any remaining users. As efficient revocation is the primary objective of broadcast encryption, solutions are also referred to as revocation schemes.\n\nRather than directly encrypting the content for qualified users, broadcast encryption schemes distribute keying information that allows qualified users to reconstruct the content encryption key whereas revoked users find insufficient information to recover the key. The typical setting considered is that of a unidirectional broadcaster and stateless users (i.e., users do not keep bookmarking of previous messages by the broadcaster), which is especially challenging. In contrast, the scenario where users are supported with a bi-directional communication link with the broadcaster and thus can more easily maintain their state, and where users are not only dynamically revoked but also added (joined), is often referred to as multicast encryption.\n\nThe problem of practical broadcast encryption has first been formally studied by Amos Fiat and Moni Naor in 1994. Since then, several solutions have been described in the literature, including combinatorial constructions, one-time revocation schemes based on secret sharing techniques, and tree-based constructions. In general, they offer various trade-offs between the increase in the size of the broadcast, the number of keys that each user needs to store, and the feasibility of an unqualified user or a collusion of unqualified users being able to decrypt the content. Luby and Staddon have used a combinatorial approach to study the trade-offs for some general classes of broadcast encryption algorithms. A particularly efficient tree-based construction is the \"subset difference\" scheme, which is derived from a class of so-called subset cover schemes. The subset difference scheme is notably implemented in the AACS for HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc encryption. A rather simple broadcast encryption scheme is used for the CSS for DVD encryption.\n\nThe problem of rogue users sharing their decryption keys or the decrypted content with unqualified users is mathematically insoluble. \"Traitor tracing\" algorithms aim to minimize the damage by retroactively identifying the user or users who leaked their keys, so that punitive measures, legal or otherwise, may be undertaken. In practice, pay TV systems often employ set-top boxes with tamper-resistant smart cards that impose physical restraints on a user learning their own decryption keys. Some broadcast encryption schemes, such as AACS, also provide tracing capabilities.\n\n"}

He was sired by the undefeated Eclipse. He was the first foal out of Sportsmistress, who was sired by Warren's Sportsman and traced to Thwaites' Dun Mare from family number 38 on her dam's side.\n\nThe origin of his name has several different versions. According to the most common, Abingdon intended to call the young colt \"Potato\" and instructed the stable boy to write the name on a feed bin. The stable boy spelled the name as \"Potoooooooo\" (Pot followed by 8 \"o\"s; that is, a failed attempt at spelling phonetically), which so amused Abingdon that he adopted the spelling. Subsequent writers have used a variety of spellings that reflect the intended revised pronunciation, \"Potatoes\". In The Jockey Club's online database equineline.com, the name is spelled as Pot8O's. The \"General Stud Book\" uses Potoooooooo.\n\nPotoooooooo raced from 1776 to 1783, accumulating from 28 to 34 wins from an estimated 40 starts, mostly in 4 mile races on Newmarket's Beacon course. In 1776, he won a 100 guinea sweepstakes at Newmarket's first spring meeting. In 1777 at age four, he finished second in two Newmarket races for 4 year old colts, third at Nottingham, and fifth in the Great Subscription Purse at York.\n\nIn 1778 at age five, Potoooooooo was entered in the 1200 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket's first spring meeting. During the race, Abingdon sold the horse to Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor for 1,500 guineas. Potoooooooo won the race and subsequently raced under Grosvenor's yellow and black silks. His subsequent wins that year included the 140 guineas subscription purse at the second spring meeting, a subscription at Ipswich, a £50 purse at Swaffham and another subscription race at Newmarket's second October meeting.\n\nIn 1779 at age six, he won a number of races at Newmarket, including the Gold Cup, a walkover for the Clermont Cup and the October Cup. In 1780, he again won several races at Newmarket, including the 140 guineas subscription purse where he beat King Fergus, the Jockey Club Plate and another walkover in the Clermont Cup. He also raced twice against Sir Charles Davers' Woodpecker, Herod's best son from these years, winning once.\n\nIn 1781, he won the Jockey Club Plate and the Whip, both by walkover, plus a 400 guineas sweep. In October, he received 85 guineas \"by common consent\" as a reward for \"not\" starting in the 140 guineas subscription purse. In 1782, he had a third walkover in the Clermont, won the Jockey Club Plate for a third time, and was victorious in the Craven Stakes, beating thirteen mostly younger horses. In 1783 at age ten, he won the Whip at Newmarket, but lost a 300 guineas match race to Assassin, who had won the previous year's Derby, and a 200 guineas sweepstakes.\n\nIn 1784, Potoooooooo was retired to stud at Oxcroft Farm near Balsham, Cambridgeshire, where he mostly covered mares owned by Grosvenor. For other mares, his stud fee was initially 5 guineas, gradually increasing to 21 guineas. In 1796, he was relocated to Upper Hare Park near Newmarket. During his career, Potoooooooo sired 172 winners of £61,971. His leading offspring include:\n\nPotoooooooo died in November 1800 at the age of 27 and was buried at Hare Park. Some 200 years later, his skeleton was uncovered when a tree blew over. The skeleton is on display at the Kings Yard Galleries of the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket.\n\nPotoooooooo was sired by the undefeated Eclipse, who was also a very successful stallion even though he never led the sire list. His dam was Sportsmistress, whose dam Golden Locks was inbred 2 × 2 to Crab – he was both her maternal and paternal grandsire. Sportsmistress would produce a total of 11 foals including Sir Thomas, winner of the 1788 Derby.\n\nPot-8-Os is inbred 4 × 4 to the Godolphin Arabian, meaning the latter appears twice in the fourth generation of Pot-8-Os pedigree.\n"}

Fernandez (born August 27, 1974) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League with the Dallas Stars, Minnesota Wild and the Boston Bruins. Fernandez was born in Etobicoke, Ontario, but grew up in Kirkland, Quebec.\n\nFernandez was drafted in the third round, 52nd overall, of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft by the Quebec Nordiques. Before playing in the NHL, he was traded to the Dallas Stars in 1994 for Tommy Sjödin and a third round pick, which ended up being Chris Drury.\n\nIn June 2000, Fernandez was traded with Brad Lukowich to the Minnesota Wild for two draft picks, a third-round pick in 2000 and a fourth-round pick in 2002.\n\nDuring the 2002–03 NHL season, Fernandez shared netminding duties with Dwayne Roloson as the Wild made their first ever appearance in the post-season, defeating the Colorado Avalanche in the first round and the Vancouver Canucks in the second before falling to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the NHL Western Conference final.\n\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Fernandez played for Luleå HF of the Elitserien in Sweden.\n\nIn his earlier years, Fernandez was often criticized for having confidence and discipline issues and being inconsistent. In a 2006 interview, Fernandez credited his improvement to gaining maturity, becoming the Wild's number one goaltender after the departure of Dwayne Roloson, and a switch to the butterfly style of goaltending.\n\nOn June 30, 2007, Fernandez was traded to the Boston Bruins for forward Petr Kalus and a fourth-round draft pick in 2009. An injury plagued 2007–08 NHL season saw Fernandez play in only four games for the Bruins, recording a 2-2 record.

Since studying at the High School of Performing Arts and the State University of New York at Purchase, she has appeared in many musicals during her career singing in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles. Her Broadway debut came in 1979 when she played Betty Rizzo in \"Grease\", serving as the replacement for the original actress of the role. In the 1980s she appeared in the musicals \"The Rocky Horror Show\", \"Oliver!\", \"Zorba\", \"Nine\", \"Anything Goes\", \"Chess\", and \"Welcome to the Club\", and in the operas \"Brigadoon\", \"South Pacific\", and \"\".\n\nIn 1992, Gaven played the character Mrs. Walker in a new production called \"The Who's Tommy\" at La Jolla Playhouse. The musical was a success, resulting in its move to Broadway in 1993. Gaven was praised by critics for her performance and received a Tony Award nomination in the \"Best Featured Actress in a Musical\" category. She eventually had to leave \"The Who's Tommy\" before its Broadway run ended because of an allergic reaction to a smoke effect used in the show. In 1995, she won an Ovation Award and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for her portrayal of Florence Vassy in \"Chess\" at Hudson Theatre. She was also awarded an Ovation Award for the role of Mother in the staging of the musical \"Ragtime\" at Shubert Theatre in 1997. Gaven's latest role in a musical was in a 2001 production of \"1776\" by UCLA's Freud Playhouse. Since then she has appeared in concerts and fundraisers.\n\nGaven has also made guest star appearances in numerous television shows and films, playing both live-action and animated roles. She voiced several characters in the animated series \"The Simpsons\" from 1999 until 2002, including Maude Flanders, Helen Lovejoy, Miss Hoover, and others. She was hired after Maggie Roswell departed from the show, due to a pay dispute. She has not been heard on the show since Roswell's return in 2002. Gaven has also lent her voice to television and radio advertisements. She is currently married to Seth Gaven owner of AV Squad, a film marketing company.\n\nGaven was born as Marcia Mitzman on February 28, 1959 in New York City, New York. She was raised with her two siblings in the village of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York by their mother Patricia Mitzman, who had previously had a career in art. Newt Mitzman, their father, directed television specials and commercials for a living. Gaven went to Hackley Elementary School in Tarrytown, New York when she was young. At that time she was certain that she wanted to work in show business. As the result of a lie, she was able to study at the High School of Performing Arts even though the school was only open to inhabitants of New York City. She then became a drama major at the State University of New York at Purchase, though she did not get a degree. She said in a 1987 interview with \"The New York Times\" that \"they kicked me out because I missed a major rehearsal\", and she never applied for readmission since she had already made her first appearance on Broadway in \"Grease\" by then. While at Purchase, Gaven performed in student productions such as \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and \"Trumpets and Drums\".\n\nGaven has had a prominent career in musical theatre and has appeared in many rock musicals. She told \"TheaterWeek\" in 1993 that she thinks those kinds of musicals are harder to sing in compared to standard musicals, and that \"the nature of rock and roll is that it's on the edge. It's written to be done dangerously. You can't be careful and do it at the same time. If you don't do it dangerously, you run the risk of losing the impact.\" During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for \"The New York Times\", she \"is categorically a mezzo soprano.\" Gaven has also been noted for her strong voice, and was once told by a sound technician at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York that \"We always turn off the mikes when you sing\" because she did not need amplification.\n\nIn March 1979, when Gaven was twenty years old, she served as the replacement actress for the character Betty Rizzo in the original Broadway production of \"Grease\". This was her Broadway debut. In late 1980, she was cast in the lead role of Janet in the musical \"The Rocky Horror Show\" that ran for six nights at Warner Theatre. It tells the story of a couple, Brad and Janet, who find themselves lost one night and end up in the laboratory of an alien doctor. The cast, including Gaven, was praised by critics. In 1984, she played a Londoner in the revival of \"Oliver!\" at Broadway and was the understudy for the major role of Nancy. That same year, in the Broadway revival of \"Zorba\", Gaven played the role of The Widow who is eventually stoned to death by the townspeople after being held responsible for the suicide of a young boy who fell in love with her. She then portrayed the character Luisa, the wife of an Italian film director, in a production of \"Nine\" at An Evening Dinner Theater in 1985.\n\nGaven starred in the New York City Opera's Broadway revival of \"Brigadoon\", in which she played Meg Brockie, at New York State Theater in 1986. The story is about a mysterious Scottish village that appears for only one day every hundred years, and Meg is one of the villagers. According to Sy Syna of the magazine \"The World & I\", Gaven was \"a huge crowd pleaser\" in the role. She was also cast in the New York City Opera's spring 1987 revival of \"South Pacific\" as the female lead character Nellie Forbush, a U.S. Navy nurse who works on a South Pacific island during World War II. This nine-week run of \"South Pacific\" had an alternating cast and Nellie was also portrayed by Susan Bigelow. Later that year in July during the New York City Opera's regular season, she appeared in the opera company's \"\" as Mrs. Lovett, who makes and sells meat pies made from the victims of serial killer Sweeney Todd.\n\nIn Pioneer Theatre Company's fall 1988 production of \"Anything Goes\", Gaven played the lead role of nightclub singer Reno Sweeney. It is set on an ocean liner on which Reno helps the character Billy Crocker win the heart of the engaged Hope Harcourt who he has fallen in love with. While reviewing the musical for the \"Deseret News\", Joseph Walker commented that Gaven \"is sensational as Reno Sweeney, the saucy, sassy hoofer-with-a-heart-of-gold. She has an arresting presence and a golden voice; the whole show always seems better when she's on stage.\" At the end of 1988, Gaven returned to the musical \"Oliver!\" in a Theatre Under The Stars production in Houston, starring as Nancy. A critic for the \"Houston Chronicle\" commended her performance, writing that she \"acts the compassionate Nancy with warmth and spirit, and sings in a strong voice full of character.\"\n\nAlso in 1988, Gaven played the part of the Russian chess player's wife Svetlana in the short-lived Broadway production of the musical \"Chess\", for which she was praised by critics. The following year she appeared as Carol Bates in the Broadway musical \"Welcome to the Club\". It revolves around four men who have been put in jail for not paying alimony. The musical shows why they ended up divorcing their wives, one of which is played by Gaven. Both \"Chess\" and \"Welcome to the Club\" were unsuccessful. John Simon criticized the latter musical in a \"New York Magazine\" review but praised Gaven's performance, writing: \"The cast ranges from the charmless to the hopeless [...] in this mess. Only Marcia Mitzman manages to stand out from the crowd, and when she gets the right part in the right show, she'll do just fine.\" Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara also wrote negatively about \"Welcome to the Club\" while giving praise to Gaven for projecting \"a sympathy [to her character] that isn't apparent in the book.\"\n\nIn December 1990, Gaven once again appeared as Nancy in a revival of \"Oliver!\"—this time in a production at 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, Washington. A theatre critic for the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" noted that she \"has the voice to anchor anything you'd care to name, even the 5th Avenue Theatre. 5th Avenue performers often sound as if they were speaking and singing through a football stadium public address system. But Mitzman overpowers malevolent acoustics.\" After \"Oliver!\", she appeared as Countess Charlotte Malcolm in Ahmanson Theatre's production of \"A Little Night Music\" that was performed from April 18 to June 30, 1991 at James A. Doolittle Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Gaven worked at 5th Avenue Theatre again in December 1991 in the musical \"Here's Love\". She portrayed the divorced Doris Walker, a single-working mother of a girl who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. During spring 1992, she played the love interest of a male songwriter and his best friend in the musical \"The Tin Pan Man\" (set in 1905) at La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts.\n\nStarting at the beginning of July 1992, Gaven appeared in a new musical called \"The Who's Tommy\" at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. It was based on the rock opera album \"Tommy\" by The Who. Gaven starred as Mrs. Walker, the mother of the boy Tommy who is traumatized when he sees his father murder Mrs. Walker's new boyfriend. Tommy ultimately becomes non-responsive, leading people to believe that he is deaf, mute, and blind, and his parents try to find a cure for his condition. Gaven later told \"TheaterWeek\" that she initially did not want to do the musical, since she \"had no idea how this could be staged as a theatrical piece. I hoped my agents wouldn't call me and ask me to audition.\" However, they did, and she was cast as Mrs. Walker after an audition in which she sang the song \"Heaven Help My Heart\" that she performed in \"Chess\", also a rock musical. \"The Who's Tommy\" was La Jolla Playhouse's biggest success yet and as a result its run was lengthened by several weeks. Later that year, Gaven once again played Doris in \"Here's Love\"—this time in a Theatre Under The Stars production.\n\nIn late 1992 it was announced that because of the success of \"The Who's Tommy\", it would be produced for Broadway and open in April 1993. The production cost eight million dollars and it broke the box office record for the biggest non-opening day with US$494,897 earned on April 23, 1993 at St. James Theatre (where the musical opened on April 22), beating \"Guys and Dolls\" 1992 record. Des McAnuff, who directed the musical at both La Jolla Playhouse and on Broadway, decided to bring many actors from the original cast with him despite weeks of auditions with thousands of actors trying out for the roles in front of him. The Broadway production featured some changes to the musical, such as a new song devoted to Tommy's parents that Gaven thought \"helps show their side of the story.\" However, as she told \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\", the biggest difference was the increased amount of money she earned. Gaven was praised by critics for her portrayal of Mrs. Walker in the Broadway production, with one critic from \"The Miami Herald\" writing that her \"alluring alto voice makes you wish Tommy's mother had even more to sing.\"\n\nIt was announced on May 10, 1993 that \"The Who's Tommy\" had received eleven Tony Award nominations, tying with \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" for the most nominations that year. Gaven received a nomination in the \"Best Featured Actress in a Musical\" category. However, as the result of an allergic reaction, she could not perform in the musical some nights. When Daryl Miller interviewed Gaven in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 1997, he noted that \"this was one of the biggest disappointments of her life, and clouds cross her face for the first time in the conversation. She glances across the room at the Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the oil in a haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't help but wonder how that affected the outcome.\" At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave \"The Who's Tommy\" some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.\nIn late 1993, she was cast in Pasadena Playhouse's musical \"Sweet, Smart, Rodgers & Hart\" that featured music and lyrics previously written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. It originally played from the middle of November to December 17, 1993, but was then extended for another run between January 6 and January 23, 1994. In July 1994, Gaven played the role of the partly African-American showboat actress Julie Dozier in Music Circus' adaptation of \"Show Boat\" in California. In the spring of the following year, she reprised her part as the Countess in a production of \"A Little Night Music\", also by Music Circus. Gaven returned to \"Chess\" in the summer of 1995 in small-scale production at Hudson Theatre, this time as the lead character Florence Vassy. The story involves a romantic triangle between the two top players, an American and a Russian, in a world chess championship, and the woman Florence who manages one and falls in love with the other. Gaven received an Ovation Award (Best Lead Actress in a Musical) and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award (Best Lead Performance) for her work in the musical.\n\nOn May 21, 1996, Gaven and seventeen other well-known musical theatre artists appeared in the show \"Say It With Music\" at Carpenter Performing Arts Center. It was staged to raise proceeds for the Musical Theatre Group, which was described by John Woolard of the \"Press-Telegram\" as \"a new organization formed to help rejuvenate musical theater in Southern California.\" The show was made up of singing and dancing numbers that had previously appeared in different Broadway musicals. From June to September 1997, Gaven played the role of Mother in the Los Angeles production (pre-Broadway) of the musical \"Ragtime\" at Shubert Theatre. She received her second Ovation Award (Best Lead Actress in a Musical) for this performance. The musical tells the story of three ethnic groups in the United States: White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, African-Americans in Harlem, and European immigrants. Gaven played the mother and matriarch of the Protestant family. \"Ragtime\" director Frank Galati praised her in the \"Los Angeles Times\" for her \"grace and beauty and magnificent voice\" and her \"extraordinarily keen intelligence—she's a very deep reader of text,\" and commented that \"she seizes the stage with energy.\" Many critics praised Gaven as well, though Laurie Winer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that she played Mother \"valiantly but with a shade too much effort.\" David Littlejohn of \"The Wall Street Journal\" cited her as \"the best single performance in this production.\"\n\nIn May of the following year, she appeared in California Musical Theatre's production of \"Triumph of Love\", a musical that had previously been staged on Broadway and is set in Sparta. It ran for six days at the Community Center Theater in Sacramento, California and featured Gaven in the role of the philosopher Hesione. In 2001, Gaven reappeared as Julie Dozier in another adaptation of \"Show Boat\" by Music Circus. \"Davis Enterprise\" critic Bev Sykes wrote positively about her voice but criticized her performance for not being credible, writing: \"Marcia Mitzman Gaven gives an uneven performance as Julie, a singer of mixed race who passes for white until she's betrayed by a spurned suitor. She is re-discovered in Act 2, having fallen into decline. Though obviously under the influence of the liquor in the bottle she carries around before and after her delivery of the song 'He's Just My Bill,' the song itself is performed straight, with no hint of the ravages that alcohol have taken on her body and voice.\" Later that same year she played the role of Abigail Adams in a production of \"1776\" by UCLA's Freud Playhouse.\n\nGaven performed in a cabaret, called \"The Girly Show\", at a fundraising gala for the Blank Theatre Company on August 15, 2005. It consisted of an all-female cast singing songs by Michael John LaChiusa, with LaChiusa playing the piano. On December 15, 2008, celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of \"The Who's Tommy\", Gaven and the rest of the original Broadway cast reunited for a concert at August Wilson Theatre in New York City. This performance was a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, the Broadway Dreams Foundation, and the Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia & Parkinson Foundation.\n\nGaven has done much voice acting in her career, lending her voice to television and radio advertisements and playing animated characters in \"The Pink Panther\" (1993), \"Red Planet\" (1994), and \"Small Soldiers\" (1998). Working with advertisements earned Gaven more money than playing theatre. \"I can make in an hour what I make in a week doing theater,\" she said in 1997. Gaven has also made guest star appearances in live-action television series such as \"The George Carlin Show\" (1994), \"Ellen\" (1995), \"Get Smart\" (1995), \"The Drew Carey Show\" (1996), \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\" (1997), \"Frasier\" (1998), and \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (1998). In addition, she had a minor role in the 2002 film \"Moonlight Mile\".\n\nWhen Maggie Roswell left the animated series \"The Simpsons\" in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, Gaven was hired to fill in for Roswell's characters. These characters included Maude Flanders, Helen Lovejoy, Miss Hoover, and others. However, Maude Flanders was killed off in the 2000 episode \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" to open up new storylines for the show. Maggie Roswell returned to \"The Simpsons\" in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home, and Gaven has not worked for the show since that year.\n\nGaven resided in Los Angeles from 1991 to 1993, when she had to move to New York City to act in \"The Who's Tommy\". However, her stay in the city was short because of the allergic reaction and she moved back to Los Angeles. While performing in musicals, Gaven had to be protective of her vocal cords and this affected her personal life. She told Miller in 1997 that \"you have to give up so much of your life\", and gave the example that when \"somebody coughs behind me [at the cinema] I immediately say to my husband, 'We may have to move.'\" She also had to avoid shouting. Gaven is currently married to Seth Gaven who owns AV Squad, a film marketing company.\n\n"}

He became a writer for funk and soul artists such as the O'Jays and The Spinners. In 1972 he would record for Paramount, releasing a single called \"Double Dutch\" under the name Franklin Franklin, but the record failed to become a hit. He was also influential in the careers of the rappers Tone Loc, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg. \n\nWith his 1981 single \"Double Dutch Bus\", released by WMOT Records, Smith popularized a nonsensical form of slang (from his song \"Slang thang\", 1981 WMOT, Records), in which \"iz\" is placed in the middle of a word (for example, the word \"place\" becomes \"pl\"iz\"ace\"), or the last letters of a word are replaced with \"-izzle\" (for example, sure becomes sh\"izzle\"). The style became part of hip-hop slang, and was popularized by rappers Snoop Dogg and E-40. The style today holds a place in popular slang.\n\n\"Double Dutch Bus\" has been sampled frequently in hip-hop, including Snoop Dogg's \"Snoop Dogg (What's My Name, Pt. 2)\" and Missy Elliott's \"Gossip Folks\". Both records were produced by Timbaland. Smith's single \"Double Dutch Bus\" is featured in the 2008 Disney movie \"College Road Trip\", starring Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symoné.\n\nA native of Philadelphia, Smith once applied to be a bus driver for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which operates Philadelphia's public transit system, but SEPTA turned him down.

The botanical garden is 22.5 hectares (0.225 km²), with 8,000 plant species, including 143 recorded in the Ukraine's Red Book of Rare Species. The Garden is famous for its exotic plants: it has the biggest collection of succulents among the countries of the former Soviet Union. The greenhouse, which was built for the largest and the oldest palm trees in Northern Eurasia, is among the highest in the world. In 1935 the garden was named after the academician and botanist Aleksandr Vasiljevich Fomin, who directed the garden for years. The vestibule of the Kiev Metro station Universytet, is located on the northern edge of the garden, which was opened in 1960.(Google Maps link).\n\nArchitect V.I. Beretti who as well known by his project of Kyiv University, was the first who raised issue of botanical garden establishment in 1834. He proposed to place the garden on the waste territory near the university buildings. For this purpose, from Kremenets Lyceum (Kiev) 513 plants were brought, that were temporarily placed in the Tsar (now City) garden. However, due to lack of funds the garden establishment was postponed for 5 years. Only in 1839 the Kiev school district administration gave permission for a temporary Botanical Garden start under the direction of Head of the Botany department of Kiev University Ernst Trautvetter, who then managed the Botanical Garden in the position of Director. \nThe official date of the Kiev Botanical Garden establishment is 22 May 1839, when E.

One of his first professional writing jobs was with the \"Indianapolis Star\", a position he held while attending Franklin College. A brilliant student, Davis received a Rhodes Scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford in 1910. His stay in England was cut short when his father fell ill and eventually died. Davis met his wife, Florence, in England.\n\nUpon his return to America, Davis became an editor for the pulp magazine \"Adventure\", leaving after a year to work as a reporter and editorial writer for \"The New York Times\". For the next decade, Davis reported on stories ranging from pugilist Jack Dempsey to evangelist Billy Sunday. It was his coverage of Billy Sunday that gained him notoriety. Davis later left \"The New York Times\" and became a freelance writer.\n\nDavis' best-known work is his company history \"History of the New York Times. 1851–1921\" (New York: The New York Times, 1921).\n\nIn 1928 Davis published his one and only novel \"Giant Killer\", a retelling of the Biblical story of David.\n\nIn August 1939, Paul White, the news chief at CBS, asked Davis to fill in as a news analyst for H. V. Kaltenborn, who was off in Europe reporting on the increasingly hostile events. Davis became an instant success. Edward R. Murrow later commented that one reason he believed that Davis was likeable was his Hoosier accent, which reminded people of a friendly neighbor. By 1941, the audience for Davis' nightly five-minute newscast and comment was 12.5 million.\n\nOn June 1, 1941, Colgate-Palmolive-Peet began sponsoring seven-days-a-week newscasts by Davis on CBS. The program was carried on 95 stations from 8:55 to 9 p.m., Eastern Time.\n\nDavis spent two and a half years reporting the news on radio and gaining the trust of the nation. Then, in 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed Davis as the director of the newly created United States Office of War Information, a sprawling organization with over 3,000 employees. Even though Davis was being paid $53,000 per year from CBS, he left the network to work in government during the crisis of World War II.\n\nAs Director of the Office of War Information, Davis recommended to President Roosevelt that Japanese-Americans be permitted to enlist for service in the Army and Navy and urged him to oppose bills in Congress that would deprive Nisei of citizenship and intern them during the war. He argued that Japanese propaganda proclaiming it a racial war could be combated by deeds that counteracted this. Davis has been termed one of the \"unsung forefathers\" of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, an all-Nisei combat unit in the war.\n\nDavis was also instrumental in loosening censorship rules that forbade the publication of images of dead GIs on the battlefield. Until late 1943, the U.S. Office of Censorship only permitted the media to publish images of blanket-covered bodies and flag-draped coffins of dead U.S. soldiers, partly for fear that Americans would be demoralized if they had any graphic understanding of the human price being paid in the war. The government also restricted what reporters could write, and coverage was generally upbeat and bloodless.\n\nDavis believed that the American public \"had a right to be truthfully informed\" about the war within the dictates of military security. He asked President Roosevelt to lift the ban on publishing photographs of dead GIs on the battlefield on the grounds that the American people needed to appreciate the sacrifices made by their young men. Roosevelt agreed. \"Life\" published a photograph taken by George Strock of three American soldiers who were killed on the beach during the Battle of Buna-Gona, the first photograph published that depicted American soldiers dead on the battlefield. Censorship was loosened, but the media was still forbidden from showing the faces of the dead or the insignia of the units they belonged to.\n\nFollowing the war, Davis continued his career in radio, using the platform to criticize Senator Joseph McCarthy for his anti-communist investigations.\n\nDavis was one of the four journalists who portrayed themselves in the 1951 film \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", and he was the host and narrator of the ABC television series, \"Pulitzer Prize Playhouse\" (1950–52), which won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\nHe was a longstanding member of The Baker Street Irregulars, the literary society dedicated to keeping green the memory of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOn June 29, 1952, the \"Washington Post\" published a two-page essay by Davis, which he opened by questioning \"how long will these former Communists and former sympathizers abuse the patience of the vast majority which had sense enough never to be Communists in the first place?\" He cited their \"arrogance\" as the most \"irritating thing\" about them. he specifically mentioned Whittaker Chambers, who at that time were testifying before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.\n\nDavis retired from broadcasting in 1953 after suffering a heart attack.\n\nDavis died in May 1958 of complications from a stroke.\n\nDavis was considered to be one of the greatest news reporters of the mid-20th century, on a level with Edward R. Murrow. Among the many awards Davis received were three Peabody Awards, including an award during its inaugural year. Foreign governments also recognized Davis when he was inducted into the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau and the Czechoslovak Order of the White Lion, among others.\n\nIn 1946, Davis received the Alfred I. duPont Award.\n\n"}

The game covers the Battle of Jutland, fought in May and June 1916 between the British Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet off the Jutland coast of Denmark.\n\nThe game is unusual for an Avalon Hill game in that there is no mapboard. Instead, the game operates on two levels: a higher level in which the two players use pencil marks on pre-printed paper maps of the North Sea to plot movements of their fleets, and, once fleets come into contact, a lower level in which the players deploy cardboard pieces each representing a single capital ship or a flotilla of light cruisers or destroyers on any convenient flat (and large) surface. Game play at the lower level is more like miniature play than like Avalon Hill's traditional hexgrid mapboard game. The game provided custom rulers for determining movement. The rulers had a rounded end for changing the direction of a line of ships. The game's instructions noted that the ship counters were not to scale in relation to movement rulers. Instructions were included for the gamer to make scale movement rulers. A large room was required to play at this scale.\n\n"}

The bass-side keyboard is usually the Stradella system or one of the various free-bass systems. Included among chromatic button accordions are the Russian bayan and Schrammel accordion. There can be 3 to 5 rows of vertical treble buttons. In a 5 row chromatic, two additional rows repeat the first 2 rows to facilitate options in fingering.\n\nComparing the layout to the piano accordion, the advantages of a chromatic button accordion are the greater range and better fingering options. On the other hand, some fingering positions require twisting of the wrist and the aspect of alternative fingering patterns may stunt one in sessions of difficult sight reading.\n\nThroughout the former Yugoslavia a 6-row chromatic button layout is used based on the B system. It is referred to as \"dugmetara\".\n\nEarly accordions were bisonoric instruments resembling modern diatonic button accordions. The first unisonoric accordions were built in Russia in the first half of the 1840s, with chromaticism not appearing until the 1850s. There are several conflicting claims of the invention of the first chromatic button accordion. The first chromatic button accordion may have been constructed as early as 1850 by Franz Walther, in 1870 by Nikolai I. Belobodorev, or as late as 1891 by Georg Mirwald. Many early chromatic button accordions were similar in design to the schrammel accordion. As the Stradella bass system would not be invented until later, these accordions often employed systems that would be considered unusual on a modern chromatic accordion, such as bisonoric bass buttons. Early chromatic button accordions were less popular than their diatonic counterpoints and unstandardized. The modern chromatic button accordion, featuring the Stradella bass system, was patented in 1897 by Paolo Soprani, with the assistance of Mattia Beraldi and Raimondo Piatanesi. Its production and sale by Paolo Soprani helped globally spread and standardize the chromatic button accordion.\n\n"}

It consisted of 22 stages over . The race was won by Pedro Delgado with the top three positions at the end of the race being occupied by specialist climbers. This Tour was nearly 1,000km shorter than the previous few editions, which were over 4,000km, but by no means easier as it included five consecutive mountain stages including a mountain time trial.\n\nThe points classification was won by Eddy Planckaert, while Steven Rooks won the mountains classification and the combination classification. The young rider classification was won by Erik Breukink, and Frans Maassen won the intermediate sprints classification. Both team classifications were won by the PDM team. During the race, Delgado failed a doping test, but because the product was not yet on the doping list from the Union Cycliste International, he was not penalised.\n\nThe UCI had also introduced a rule that limited the number of cyclists in a race to 200. In 1987, the Tour had started with 207 cyclists, so because of this rule, the number of teams in the 1988 Tour was reduced from 23 to 22, of 9 riders, a total of 198. 22 teams were announced two weeks before the Tour. The Tour organisation named three reserve teams, in case one of the 22 teams was unable to start: Postobón–Ryalco, Roland–Colnago and .\n\nOf the 198 cyclists starting the race, 42 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The average age of riders in the race was 27.56 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Jean-Claude Colotti () to the 39-year-old Hennie Kuiper (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nThe winner of the 1987 Tour de France, Stephen Roche, was unable to defend his title as he was coming back from knee surgeries. The winner from 1986, Greg LeMond, had still not fully recovered from the hunting accident that caused him to miss the 1987 Tour, and did not start this Tour. Remaining favourites were Pedro Delgado, who had finished in second place in 1987, and Andrew Hampsten, the winner of the 1988 Giro d'Italia, several weeks before the Tour.\n\nThe \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" (UCI) introduced the rule that a cycling race could not span three weekends. The Tour de France could therefore only start on Monday 4 July, and the prologue was removed. The Tour organisers were not happy with this, and they extended the Tour by adding a 'prelude' or 'preface' to the race, circumventing the rule by making it unofficial. Each team would ride for , and one cyclist per team would then finish one kilometer on his own. The recorded times were not used for the rest of the Tour, but the cyclist with the fastest time would wear the yellow jersey in the next stage.\n\nThe total length of this Tour was , which was the shortest since 1906. Since 1910, Belgian cyclists had won at least one stage in every Tour, but in 1988 they did not win any stages. There was one rest day, during which the cyclists were transferred from Villard-de-Lans to Blagnac. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 15.\n\nThe prelude was won by Guido Bontempi, and the first official stage was won by Steve Bauer. Bauer lost the lead in the next stage, a Team Time Trial, to Teun van Vliet. The favourites for the overall victory did not lose time in the first stages. The individual time trial of stage six did not change that, although some outsiders (Sean Kelly and Laurent Fignon) lost two minutes.\n\nIn the eleventh stage, in hilly conditions, the first serious attacks were seen. Most contenders were able to stay in the main group, but Laurent Fignon and Jean-François Bernard lost a lot of time and were no longer seen as contenders. The twelfth stage included higher climbs. Delgado escaped on the climb of the Glandon, and he was joined by Steven Rooks. On the descent, they were joined by Gert-Jan Theunisse and Fabio Parra; the other cyclists were unable to get to them. Close to the finish, Rooks escaped and won the stage, and Delgado became the new leader of the general classification. Delgado won the next stage, an uphill individual time trial, and solidified his lead.\n\nIn the fourteenth stage, the favourites stayed together, and other cyclists were allowed to go for the stage victory. Philippe Bouvatier and Robert Millar, who had led over the previous two cols, were in the uphill sprint to win, until Bouvatier allowed himself to be misdirected by a gendarme 200 metres before the finish (at the point where the team cars were separated from the cyclists) followed by Millar, and the victory went to Massimo Ghirotto. Ghirotto offered his prize (a new car) to Bouvatier though Millar maintained he would have overhauled Bouvatier to win and told CyclingNews in 2010 that \"I don't know if the gendarme was to blame, I don't think he was, I know I would have come round Bouvatier in the sprint but then I ought to have dropped him before we got to that stage\".\n\nIn the fifteenth stage, Delgado increased his lead. He let Laudelino Cubino get away and claim the victory, because Cubino was no threat for the general classification, and finished in third place, gaining time on all his direct competitors. Delgado further increased his lead in the nineteenth stage, by leaving the other cyclists behind him on the final climb of the day. Delgado was aiming to win the twenty-first stage, an individual time trial, and was leading at all the intermediate check points, but lost time in the final part of the stage, finishing in fourth place. This was more than enough to secure the overall victory.\n\nDuring the race, it was announced that doping tests of Pedro Delgado and Gert-Jan Theunisse indicated they had used doping products.\n\nIn Delgado's case, it was probenecid. Probenecid was a doping product according to the International Olympic Committee not yet on the doping list of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), so Delgado was not sanctioned, and he remained the winner of the Tour. Tour director Louy tried to convince Delgado to leave the race voluntarily, but Delgado refused. Delgado admits that he took probenecid, but with the intention to assist the kidneys, not to mask anabolic steroids.\n\nTheunisse was found to have a high testosterone-level, which was on the UCI doping list. Theunisse received a penalty of ten minutes, which dropped him from fifth place to eleventh place in the general classification.\n\nOne other cyclist was penalised during this Tour: Spanish cyclist Roque de la Cruz failed a doping test after the sixth stage, and was given the same penalty as Theunisse.\n\nIn 2013, a notebook from the team doctor of the PDM team showed that all but one of the PDM cyclist were given doping in the 1988 Tour de France.\n\nThe owners of the Tour de France thought that director Louy had handled the Delgado affair in the wrong way, and they fired him later that year. They appointed Jean-Marie Leblanc as his replacement.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1988 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThere was also a combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications, its leader wore the combination jersey.\n\nAnother classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey.\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 25 years were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. For the last time, there was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Jérôme Simon won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 15. This prize was won by Laudelino Cubino.\n\n"}

{"id": "2280969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2280969", "title": "Diatonic button accordion", "text": "Diatonic button accordion\n\nA melodeon or diatonic button accordion is a member of the free-reed aerophone family of musical instruments. It is a type of button accordion on which the melody-side keyboard contains one or more rows of buttons, with each row producing the notes of a single diatonic scale. The buttons on the bass-side keyboard are most commonly arranged in pairs, with one button of a pair sounding the fundamental of a chord and the other the corresponding major triad (or, sometimes, a minor triad).\n\nDiatonic button accordions are popular in many countries, and used mainly for playing popular music and traditional folk music, and modern offshoots of these genres.\n\nVarious terms for the diatonic button accordion are used in different parts of the English-speaking world.\n\n\nTo simplify matters and avoid ambiguity, in the remainder of this article the term diatonic button accordion, or DBA, will be used.\n\n\nThe following definitions will assist understanding of this article. \n\nMost diatonic button accordions have a \"single-action\" (or bisonoric) keyboard, meaning that each button produces two notes: one when the bellows are pressed or pushed (closed) and another when the bellows are drawn or pulled (opened). In this respect, these instruments operate like a harmonica.\n\nOther single-action or bisonoric members of the free-reed family include the German concertina, the Anglo-German (or \"Anglo\") concertina, the bandoneon, the Chemnitzer concertina (see concertina) and the mouth organ (harmonica).\n\nThere are varieties of diatonic button accordion that are double-action, such as the garmon.\n\nBecause each button produces two notes, the diatonic scale can be covered in four buttons on a melody row.\n\nFor example, on a melody row pitched in C, the notes of the lower full octave of the instrument's range are assigned to four buttons as follows:\n\n\"Note: the first button in the example above, numbered 1, is likely to be the 3rd or 4th button in a row on an instrument.\"\n\nWhen the bellows are pressed, every button produces a note from the major triad of the home key; in this case, the pattern CEG repeats itself throughout the keyboard. The remaining notes of the diatonic scale are produced when the bellows are drawn or pulled.\n\nSince there are seven notes in the diatonic scale, and since each button produces two notes, the note pairings on the buttons change in each octave. In the second full octave of the instrument's range, E is paired with D (instead of with F in the first octave), and so on.\n\nBecause the range of each row is typically restricted to two complete octaves (with a few notes above and below), the inconsistent note pairing from one octave to the next remains manageable.\n\nFor detailed diagrams of typical note layouts on various types of diatonic button accordion, see melodeon.net\n\nOn a one-row DBA, music in a single major key and its relative minor can be played. For example, an instrument in D can play music in D major and B minor. However, the variety of music that can be played on a one-row instrument is wider than these facts might suggest: besides D major and B minor, our one-row instrument in D can play tunes in A Mixolydian and E Dorian, and tunes that use gapped scales, such as pentatonic tunes with a root of D, G or A.\n\nA one-row DBA has the advantages of being light and compact, but is by its nature limited to the notes of a single diatonic scale. Since the mid-to-late 19th century, instruments have been produced with more than one row in order to give players a greater choice of scales and tonalities.\n\nMulti-row systems can be divided into two broad classes: \"fourth-apart\" systems and \"semitone-apart\" systems.\n\nFourth-apart systems are the most widespread form of multi-row DBA. Moving from the outside the keyboard towards the inside, each row is pitched one-fourth higher than its neighbour. Conventionally, the outer keyboard row is specified first: for an example, on a G/C instrument the outer row is in the key of G, the inner row in C.\n\nCommonly used in continental Europe are two-row systems in G/C and C/F and three-row systems in G/C/F, but many other permutations exist. In England, in the latter part of the 20th century, the D/G configuration became firmly established as the standard for interpreting traditional music of England, and particularly for the accompaniment of social and Morris dancing.\n\nThree-row systems are also popular in Mexico and the United States (in Conjunto, Tejano, Zydeco and Cajun musics) and Colombia (in Vallenato and Folklor musics). Tunings include B/E/A, A/D/G, G/C/F, F/B/E and E/A/D. The three-row fourth-apart configuration is known as the \"international system.\"\n\nMulti-row systems obviously extend the range of tonalities available. But since many notes in the additional rows are \"reversals\" (duplicate notes produced by the opposite bellows action), multi-row systems allow greater flexibility of phrasing, since the player can often choose whether or not to change bellows direction, or to harmonize with a particular chord, by choosing a note from one row or another. Styles of play have developed in which row-crossing allows the bass side to be used to maximum effect, and the number of changes of bellows direction greatly reduced.\n\nAnother feature designed to increase the flexibility of fourth-apart systems is the inclusion of notes that lie beyond the diatonic scales of each row, or \"accidentals\". These notes are most often operated by the buttons at the top of the keyboard (that is, closest to the player's chin), below the lowest notes of the scale.\n\nAccidentals are sometimes placed on two extra buttons, or a shorter third row of four or more buttons, close to the bellows. The \"Club system\" developed by Hohner is a well-established example of this approach. Using the accidentals, and with the added modification of a \"Gleichton\" (unisonoric second-octave tonic in the centre of the middle row), this system allows players to obtain a fully chromatic scale – albeit in one direction only (draw).\n\nAnother use of such additional short rows, or half-rows, is to provide reversals (see above) to give the player greater flexibility.\n\nIn semitone-apart systems, moving in from the outside the keyboard, each row is pitched a semitone higher than its neighbour. This configuration makes all the notes of the chromatic scale available. As a result, such instruments could strictly be termed chromatic (rather than diatonic) instruments. In practice, however, the restrictions imposed by the single action and layout of the keyboard lead most players to keep to a fairly restricted range of keys (albeit a wider range than is practical on most fourth-apart systems).\n\nThe earliest semitone-apart system was C/C, and many variants have been used over the years, notably D/D and G/G. However, since the mid-20th century two main systems have been in widespread use: the B/C system, used mainly for Irish and Scottish music, along with its larger cousin, the B/C/C system (which is now little used outside Scotland); and the C/D system, somewhat less common, used mainly in Irish music. (Irish-American musicians of the mid-20th century used this system with the position of the rows reversed, i.e. D/C.)\n\nTraditionally, one-row instruments have two or four buttons on the bass side, two-row instruments have eight, and three-row instruments twelve. As mentioned above, bass buttons are conventionally arranged in bass-note/chord pairs.\n\nSome modern players, particularly in France, are driving a trend towards instruments with more complex bass systems, with as many as 16 or even 18 buttons. Sometimes these more elaborate systems will diverge from the single-action principle, and may feature bass notes only instead of bass-chord pairs of buttons.\n\nThe B/C/C system (also known as the \"British Chromatic System\") used in Scotland provides a notable example of the use of a double-action bass side with a single-action melody side: these instruments frequently feature a full Stradella bass system as used on piano accordions and chromatic button accordions.\n\nSeveral distinct variations of the DBA have developed in different regions of the world. These include the Russian garmon, the Steirische Harmonika or Slovenian-style accordion that is popular in Alpine regions of Europe, the Swiss Schwyzerörgeli and the Basque trikitixa; the last two combine single- and double-action (bisonoric and unisonoric) features. A common type of Italian \"organetto\" has a single melody row augmented with a very short half-row of between two and four buttons (often smaller in diameter than those on the main row) providing reversals only.\n\nDBAs have two main advantages when compared with chromatic accordions such as piano accordions and chromatic button accordions: 1) smaller size and lighter weight, 2) and the rhythmic effects inherent in the single (\"push-pull\") action.\n\nThe size and weight difference results from the nature of accordion reeds, which produce sound when air is moved through them in one direction only. In other words, for any key or button, two reeds are necessary: one to sound on the press, and one to sound on the draw. Because a double-action instrument sounds the same note on both press and draw, it needs two reeds for any given note in its range, where a single-action instrument—which sounds a different note on press and draw—requires only one. Any double-action instrument thus requires roughly twice as many reeds as an equivalent single-action instrument, making it larger and considerably heavier. (Another way to understand this difference is to consider the fact that a double-action instrument generally requires twice as many keys or buttons to produce a range of notes as a single-action instrument: for example, a piano accordion requires 8 keys (16 reeds) to sound a diatonic scale from C to C', where a DBA pitched in C requires 4 buttons (8 reeds) to produce the same notes.) This size and weight advantage is somewhat eroded in more complex, multi-row variants of the DBA, alluded to below.\n\nThe rhythmic effects inherent in the push-pull action are very well suited to the lively rhythms of dance music, and traditional dance music in particular. (On multi-row fourth-apart instruments, players can to some extent counter the natural push-pull effect with a row-crossing playing style that \"smooths out\" the musical phrasing; on semitone-apart systems, depending on the key of the piece being played, players may be obliged to adopt a smoother style.) Additionally, the close-togetherness of the notes on a DBA allow some tunes (particularly the quick folkdances and tunes written for the instrument) to be played with more ease and speed than on the more spread-out keyboards of chromatic- and piano-accordions. For example, playing an Irish reel might be easier on a B/C system diatonic than on a piano-accordion, and a Swiss \"Schottisch\" or \"Ländler\" might be easier to play on a \"Schwyzerörgeli\" than on a piano or even a chromatic due to the chordal/arpeggio phrases that fall naturally on the buttons that are arranged thus.\n\nThe main disadvantage of the diatonic system is that playing in a wide range of keys is impractical. Attempts to overcome this limitation, for example by adding extra rows and more complicated bass systems, invariably add extra bulk and weight, thereby compromising an advantage in striving to overcome a disadvantage. Extreme examples are 18-bass three-row instruments of the type favoured by some French musicians, and B/C/C accordions with 120-button Stradella basses: the size and weight of both these types can be greater than medium-sized piano or chromatic accordions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The high, five part bridge on four piers spans False Creek, connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends. It is one of three bridges crossing False Creek. The other two bridges are the Granville Bridge, three blocks or to the southeast, and the Cambie Street Bridge, about 11 blocks or to the east. In addition to the vehicle deck, the Burrard Bridge has wide sidewalks and a dedicated cycling lane on both sides.\n\nThe architect of the Burrard Street Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below deck level, while its central span is a Pratt truss placed above deck level to allow greater clearance height for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by overhead galleries, which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge's superstructure (a V under Vancouver's bust, a B under Burrard's).\n\nUnifying the long approaches and the distinctive central span are heavy concrete railings, originally topped with decorative street lamps. These pierced handrails were designed as a kind of visual shutter (stroboscopic effect), so that at a speed of 50 km/h motorists would see through them with an uninterrupted view of the harbour. The effect works at speeds from about 40 to 64 km/h.\n\nThe Burrard Street Bridge, opened July 1, 1932, was built to provide a high-level crossing from Vancouver to the southwestern neighbourhoods in Kitsilano, by connecting Burrard Street to Cedar Street. After completion, Burrard was extended through to the base of downtown and Cedar Street disappeared.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, entertainment was provided by two bands, the Kitsilano Boy's Band and the Fireman's Band. An RCAF seaplane flew under the bridge and later a sugar replica of the bridge was unveiled at the civic reception in the Hotel Vancouver.\n\nG.L. Thornton Sharp, of Sharp and Thompson, was the architect responsible for the distinctive towers on the bridge and its middle galleries. \"Both central piers,\" Sharp told a reporter, \"were designed and connected with an overhead gallery across the road. This helped to mask the network of steel in the truss from the two approaches, and has been treated as an entrance gateway to the city.\" Along their other axis, the full height of the piers above the water also serve to frame a sea entrance gateway, notably for pleasure craft: \"by sea and land we prosper\". The piers have provision for a rapid transit vertical lift span beneath the highway deck, never installed.\nBurrard Street Bridge has been assessed by heritage consultants retained by the City of Vancouver as being in the top category of historic buildings in Vancouver. The bridge appeared on a stamp issued by Canada Post in 2011, in a series showcasing five notable Art Deco structures in Canada.\n\nWhen constructed, the Burrard Street Bridge did not have dedicated lanes for cyclists, who shared the bridge's six vehicle lanes with motorists. Later, as traffic volume grew and speed limits were increased on the bridge to 60 km/h, cyclists were directed to share the bridge's sidewalks with pedestrians. Over time, the volume of pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalks created a dangerous situation, with several accidents occurring, which resulted in at least one successful lawsuit against the city.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the city of Vancouver has investigated various options to rectify the situation. The two most prominent options were 1) to introduce bicycle lanes on the bridge's vehicle deck by reallocating one or more vehicle lanes, and 2) to build horizontal extensions on the outside of the bridge to create additional sidewalk space. Other options have included building an entirely new pedestrian and/or cyclist only bridge, and building another deck on the bridge below the existing deck.\n\nHeritage advocates have been strongly opposed to the construction of outside sidewalk extensions, which would likely alter significantly the historical character of the bridge. Fiscal conservatives have also been opposed to high costs associated with this option.\n\nMany motorists and others have opposed reallocation of vehicle lanes to bicycle lanes, believing that the reduction in vehicle carrying capacity would create excessive traffic problems both on the bridge and on and around alternate crossings, such as the Granville Street Bridge.\n\nBeginning March 26, 1996, in a six-month trial by the City, one commuter lane was closed to automobile traffic and made into a temporary cyclist lane. However, after one week, the City was forced to revert the lane to its original purpose, due to outrage by some motorists.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, a detailed engineering and planning report was presented to Council, reviewing the situation broadly, presenting alternatives, and offering recommendations. (Its computer visualizations of various proposals [esp. pp. 8–12—notably p. 8—and Appendix E] are indispensable illustrations to the discussion. See )\n\nThat day Vancouver City Council voted 10–1 not to follow the recommendations of the report, but to reallocate the two curb-side lanes to cyclists for another trial, as part of Council's plan to increase cycling in Vancouver by 10 percent for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe issue was carried into the municipal election of November 19, 2005.\n\nOn December 20, 2005 the newly elected Council voted 6-4 to cancel the lane reallocation trial and to proceed directly to widening the bridge sidewalks as promised in that election.\n\nIn 2006, the City considered removing the concrete railings and widening the bridge deck by outward ('outrigger') sidewalks, at projected cost of over $40 million. (See p. 8 of ) To preserve the bridge's heritage value, such cantilevered structures would not include the bridge's central piers, or towers. Critics of this plan argued that the resulting \"pinch points\" would defeat the purpose of widening the bridge by creating bottlenecks, through which a greater number of cyclists, skaters and pedestrians must pass over coming decades.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, in 2008 Heritage Vancouver listed the Burrard Bridge first on its Top Ten endangered sites in Vancouver. It had ranked fourth in 2005.\n\nSidewalk expansion was delayed by the Squamish First Nation, which controls the land directly under the south (or west) side of the bridge. For construction to begin, the city would require permission from this group, which has expressed concern that machinery working on the site may affect their land.\n\nThe Squamish First Nation erected advertising billboards on their properties, located at that bridge approach, and is proposing the same for similar properties by the Lions' Gate Bridge and the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing.\nIn a late April 2008 report to Council, city engineers raised the estimated cost of widening to $57 million, due to reconsideration of the additional weight to the existing bridge structure and rising construction costs. $61 million was set as a more likely figure.\n\nIn Nov. 2008 the current Council, which advocated widening the bridge, was defeated and replaced by a new mayor and Council opposed to the widening but supportive of lane reallocation from vehicles to cyclists. In late January 2009, in an economic downturn and anticipating the 2010 Winter Olympics, the City announced plans for trials of three kinds of auto traffic lane closings, allowing bicycle use of the road surface. This would be supplemented by safety upgrades.\n\nIn March 2009, the City of Vancouver delayed discussing the Burrard Bridge Bike Lane Trial at least one month. . Council rescheduled meeting to May 5, 2009 to discuss the three kinds of possible trials, to begin summer 2009, where one approved.\n\nOn May 7, 2009, Council approved a motion to proceed with option 3 of the proposed trials, to begin in June 2009. The proposed trial began on July 13. It saw the southbound motor-vehicle curb lane and the northbound-side sidewalk allocated to bicycles, with the southbound-side sidewalk allocated to pedestrians. The reassigned lane was separated from motor vehicles by a physical barrier. As part of the trial, traffic pattern changes to accommodate feeder bicycle traffic were also completed on Pacific St., next to the North bridgehead, over complaints from local merchants that cited lack of consultation and possible negative impacts on their businesses. Three days into the trial, a local merchant reported a 46% drop in sales compared to the same days the year before. Six weeks into the trial another local merchant reported a 25% drop in sales, and a local restaurant reported a 30% drop in sales.\n\nRegarding effects on three kinds of traffic: two weeks into the trial, the City of Vancouver released a data report showing daily bicycle travel across the bridge had increased by an average of 30%. The same report indicated little change in pedestrian trips, a slight drop in motor vehicle trips, but no change in motor vehicle travel times between 12th Avenue and Georgia Street along Burrard via the bridge.\n\nIn July 2009 a website allowing people to register opposition to the bike lane trail was set up by local realtor and former NPA parks candidate Keith Roy at www.unblockthebridge.ca .\n\nBy 2019, the bike lane on the Burrard Bridge had become the busiest bike lane in North America.

It is visible to traffic travelling in both directions on the bridge and each screen (one for each direction) measures 9 metres wide x 3 metres tall. The advertisements will cycle every ten seconds. \nThere has been controversy and protest from neighbouring residents who claim the billboard is unsightly, blocks view corridors of the mountains and even that it is a dangerous distraction to drivers.\nThere are at least five other similar billboards going up near the Lions Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing as well as near the Stawamus Chief on Highway 99.\nThe billboards were approved by the federal government.

The group was inspired by Georges Sorel, Charles Maurras and a selective reading of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.\n\nFounded in 1911 by national-syndicalist disciples of Georges Sorel, Georges Valois and Édouard Berth, the group was described as \"founded by nationalists, and initially addressed only to them\". The organisation began as informal meetings consisting of about twenty people on average, mainly monarchists and syndicalists who were associated with the right-wing monarchist group, Action Française. The main speakers at these meetings were Valois, Berth, monarchist militant Henri Lagrange and nationalist philosopher Gilbert Mayor. French historian, Géraud Poumarède, describes the Circle's ambition as to \"convert trade unionists to the monarchy\".\n\nDespite the group's close association to Sorel he was initially hostile to the group stating that he feared the Circle would make \"young people less able to understand Proudhon\". Charles Maurras was also wary of the group describing them in his book, \"L’Action française et la religion catholique\" (1913): \"The French who met to found the Circle Proudhon are all nationalists . The boss they chose for their assembly made them meet other French, who are not nationalists, who are not royalists , and who join them to participate in the life of the Circle and the writing of Cahiers. The initial group includes men of different origins, different conditions, who have no political aspirations in common, and who will freely expose their views in the Cahiers.\"\n\nThe Circle published a bulletin entitled, \"Cahiers du Cercle Proudhon\" and operated a bookstore owned by Valois named the La Nouvelle Librairie which is still open to this day.\n\nThe first issue of \"Cahiers du cercle Proudhon\" appeared in January – February 1912 and included a \"Déclaration\":\n\nBerth and Valois had been brought together by Georges Sorel when he was planning a Nationalist and socialist-leaning journal \"La Cité française\" in 1910.

However Variot quarrelled with Valois and went on to publish material with Sorel's support in \"L'Indépendence\".\n\nA controversial but influential book by Zeev Sternhell, \"Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France\", points to the Cercle Proudhon as a pre-existing laboratory for fascist ideas that would provide a bulwark for Nazi collaboration in Vichy.\n\nMany anarchists rejected the Cercle Proudhon interpretation of Proudhon's works.

{"id": "2281002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281002", "title": "American Recordings (album)", "text": "American Recordings (album)\n\nAmerican Recordings is the 81st album by the country singer Johnny Cash. It was released on April 26, 1994 by American Recordings, after it had changed its name from Def American.\n\nThe album marked the beginning of a career resurgence for Cash, who was widely recognized as an icon of American music but whose record sales had suffered during the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nCash was approached by producer Rick Rubin and offered a contract with Rubin's American Recordings label, better known for rap and heavy metal than for country music. Rubin had seen Cash perform at Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert in late 1992, and felt Cash was still a vital artist who had been unfairly written off by the music industry. Suffering from health problems and recovering from a relapse of his drug addiction, Cash was initially skeptical. The two men soon bonded, however, particularly when Rubin promised Cash a high level of creative control. Rubin told the singer: \"I would like you to do whatever feels right for you\", and Cash decided to record the first solo album of his career without any accompanying musicians. \"Sitting and talking and playing music… that was when we got to build up a friendship,\" Rubin recalled. \"My fondest memories are just of hanging out and hearing his stories. He didn't speak much but, if you drew him out, he seemed to know everything. He was shy and quiet but a wise, wise man.\"\n\nUnder Rubin's supervision, Cash recorded most of the album in his own Tennessee cabin or Rubin's home in Los Angeles, accompanied only by his guitar. This was a return to Cash's earliest recording style. His first producer, Sam Phillips, had determined in the 1950s that Cash's voice was best suited to a stripped-down style and a three or four-piece ensemble (Cash on vocals and guitar, backed with another guitarist and upright bass, and sometimes drums). Subsequent producers deviated from this style with more ornate backing; Cash disagreed with Jack Clement in the 1960s when the producer tried to give Cash's songs a fashionable \"twangy\" feel and to add frills like orchestral string sections and barbershop quartet -style backup singers. In his autobiography, Cash wrote about his frustration with Columbia Records in the 1970s and 1980s, due in part to creative disagreements, such as recording his vocals separately from the backing musicians. Cash's successful collaboration with Rick Rubin was in part due to Rubin seeking a minimalist sound for his songs.\n\n\"Tennessee Stud\" and \"The Man Who Couldn't Cry\" were recorded live at the Viper Room, a Sunset Strip, Los Angeles nightclub owned at the time by Johnny Depp. \"The Beast in Me\" was written and originally recorded by Cash's former stepson-in-law Nick Lowe. Rubin commissioned new songs from several musicians, two of which ended up on \"American Recordings\". \"Down There By The Train\" was a spiritual or gospel style song of redemption by Tom Waits. \"Thirteen\" was a more ominous composition by Glenn Danzig, whose heavy metal band had earlier worked with Rubin; Danzig wrote the song specifically for Cash in less than twenty minutes.\n\nTwo songs on the album had been recorded by Cash previously: \"Delia's Gone\", for the 1962 album \"The Sound of Johnny Cash\" and \"Oh, Bury Me Not\", for 1965's \"Johnny Cash Sings the Ballads of the True West\".\n\nThe album cover was photographed while Cash was visiting Australia, at Werribee near Melbourne.\n\n\"American Recordings\" received widespread acclaim from critics. \"Q\" magazine deemed it the year's most sincere and ambitious record, while \"NME\" found it \"uplifting and life affirming because the message is taught through adversity, ill luck and fighting for survival\". David Browne, writing in \"Entertainment Weekly\", said Cash remained a captivating singer throughout the austerely arranged country ballads and bizarre reflections, calling the record \"his most relaxed and folkiest album in three decades\". In a rave review in \"Rolling Stone\", Anthony DeCurtis hailed it as one of Cash's greatest albums because of his self-possessed, \"biblically intense\" take on traditional folk songs and Rubin's no-frills production: \"\"American Recordings\" is at once monumental and viscerally intimate, fiercely true to the legend of Johnny Cash and entirely contemporary.\" Mark Cooper from \"Mojo\" called it a \"breathtaking blend of the confessional and the self-mythologising\". In the \"Chicago Tribune\", Greg Kot wrote that Cash's singing was effectively dramatic throughout \"the quagmire of humor and bloodshed, pathos and treachery evoked by these songs\", while \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Randy Lewis said they \"peer into the dark corners of the American soul\" on what was a \"milestone work\" for Cash.\n\nIn a negative review for \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau felt \"American Recordings\" had been overhyped by antisocial sycophants and lacked the vital shuffle beat of Cash's best music, citing \"Delia's Gone\" and perhaps \"Thirteen\" as \"the only time words and voice combine with the undeniable seniority his claque claims to hear everywhere\". In retrospect, AllMusic's Mark Deming wrote that the album \"became a critical sensation and a commercial success, though it was overrated in some quarters simply because it reminded audiences that one of America's greatest musical talents was still capable of making compelling music, something he had never stopped doing even if no one bothered to listen.\"\n\nAt the end of 1994, \"American Recordings\" was voted the seventh best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. In other year-end lists, it was ranked 36th by \"Select\", 23rd by \"NME\", 19th by \"Rockdelux\", 17th by \"Les Inrockuptibles\", 15th by \"The Face\", 5th by the \"Los Angeles Times\", 4th by \"Mojo\", and 2nd by \"OOR\". At the 1995 Grammy Awards, it won Cash a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. \"Rolling Stone\" later placed the record at number 366 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and Country Music Television (CMT) ranked it number 27 on the network's list of the top 40 greatest country albums in its 2006 list.\n\n"}

{"id": "2281014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281014", "title": "Beypore", "text": "Beypore\n\nBeypore or \"Beypur\" is an ancient port town and a locality town in Kozhikode district in the state of Kerala, India. The place was formerly known as Vaypura / Vadaparappanad. Tippu Sultan, ruler of Mysore, named the town \"Sultan Pattanam\". There is a marina and a beach while \"Beypore port\" is one of the oldest ports in Kerala, which historically traded with the Middle East. Beypore is noted for building wooden ships, known as \"dhows\" or \"urus\" in the Malayalam language. These ships were usually bought by Arab merchants for trading and fishing but are now used as tourist ships. According to Captain Iwata, founder member of the Association of Sumerian ships in Japan, Sumerian ships might have been built in Beypore. There is evidence to prove that Beypore had direct trade links with Mesopotamia and was a prominent link on the maritime silk route.\n\nBeypore was ruled by four Kovilakams - Karippa Puthiyakovilakam, Manayat Kovilakam, Nediyaal Kovilakam and Panagad Kovilakam.\nAs the Gazetteers explain, the Beypore amsam itself had four Kovilakams called - Manayatt kovilakam, Nediyal\nkovilakom, Puthiya kovilakom and the Panangat kovilakom belonging to the family of the Beypore\nbranch of the Parappanad family. So we have North and South Parappanad factions to start with,\nbranching off the Parappur lordship. The North faction was further split into Beypore, Cheruvannor\nand Panniyankara Kovilakoms. Considering that Ravi Varma and his brother mentioned Beypore\nand the specific Manayyat location, let us for a moment assume Raja Ravi Varma hailed from the forerunners of the present Manayyat kovilakom.\n\nRaja Raja Varma in his diary states - Near this\n‘Beypore’ Kovilakam or house is a temple of Vettakaruman or the Hunter God which it is said and acknowledged by its present owners, the Manayam Rajahs, once belonged to us of the Tattari Kovilakam house, by which our family was known. Based on all the above, I would assume that the original Parappanad rajas named their home the Tattari Kovilakom. It is from this home, which\nincidentally is further linked to the Kolathunad Rajas (Kolathiris) that various rulers (such as Marthanda Varma) and consorts as well as adoptees to the Travancore kingdom originated. Of course as we see, the ruling king usually reserved the right on the name raja and took affront to another cousin using the title while a raja was in power and complained, but then again, Ravi Varma in reality had some self-projection in mind, as we note. Now let us study the relations between the Parappanad Kovilakoms and the Travancore royal family to see where and how Ravi Varma fits in.\n\nIt is believed that the Beypore Siva Temple protects the whole kingdom. Beypore was visited first by Romans and afterwards by Chinese, Syrians, Arabs and in recent centuries by Europeans for trade. Beypore has long history of being a centre for shipbuilding since the first century AD, and it was further expanded under the East India Company during the early nineteenth century. The Indian Ocean trade started from ancient times and strengthened during the medieval times. While in the old days Malabar directly traded with the Greeks and Romans, it concentrated on exchanges with the Middle Eastern ports in the medieval times. This exchange of goods resulted also in transfer of people from their abodes. While it is mentioned that Malabari’s were found along African ports and even Egypt’s, it was mostly Arabs who migrated to the Malabar coasts, mainly to administer, control and conduct the trade with their brethren in Yemen, Basra and Egyptian ports. Beypore was virtually free port with only an export import duty imposed by the ruling Zamorins. The intermediaries between the Arabs and the Nairs were the Moplah’s (themselves a community started by the intermingling Arab men and local women from ancient times). Also the south east Malay ports sent ships to Malabar for the cloth from Kerala, until British cloth took its place later in the 19th century. It was also a stop over for Hajj pilgrims from south east Asia. The Arab settlers in Malabar even had African slaves during that period.\nThe internationally well known Tasara Creative Weaving Centre which attracts textile artists and designers from all over the world is situated in North Beypore which is just one Km away from the Boat building yard.\nBeypore was known as \"Beydhaalhee\" in neighboring Maldives. Maldivian national hero Muhammad Thakurufan learnt martial art and did his religious studies in Beypore.\n\nBeypore port is a Sub-port of Kozhikode port and is situated approximately 10 km south of Kozhikode. The land for the port was acquired from Beypore Karippa Puthiyakovilakam in the year 1963-64. It is an estuarine port, where Beypore river discharges into the Arabian Sea. Beypore is 180 km North of Cochin and 391 km away from Trivandrum. Beypore port is the second biggest port in Kerala after Cochin and currently handles about 100,000 tonnes of cargo and 7500 passengers per annum. The nearest ports are Kochi and Mangalore. Now the port has a depth of about 5 meters alongside wharf and approach channel and it is proposed to be developed in stages and utilities like storage shed, cranes and tugs are already installed. Beypore port is one of the oldest ports in Kerala from where trading was done to the Middle East.\n\nThe Uru (boat), or \"Fat Boat\", is a generic name for large Dhow-type wooden ships made by vishwabrahmins in Beypore. This type of boat has been used by the Arabs since ancient times as trading vessels, and even now, urus are being manufactured and exported to Arab nations from Beypore. These boats used to be built of several types of wood, the main one being teak. The teak was taken from Nilambur forests in earlier times, but now imported Malaysian teak is used.\n\nBeypore is located at . It has an average elevation of 1 metre (3 feet).\n\nBy road : Beypore is well connected by road and is just 11 km from Kozhikode.\n\nBy air : Calicut airport, is at Karipur and is 23 km from Kozhikode city centre\n\nBy rail : Kozhikode station 10 km apart and Feroke 4 km apart\n\nAs of 2001 India census, Beypore had a population of 66,883. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Beypore has an average literacy rate of 81%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 50% of the males and 50% of females literate. 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n\nIndian Coast Guard has established its only third station in Kerala at Beypore, namely Coast Guard Station Beypore. It was commissioned on 25 May 2006.\n\n\n"}

Before then, the city as a whole was responsible for them since the incorporation of Toronto in 1834. In the nineteenth century, the focus of the committee was on the maintenance of green space and the provision of walks and gardens; not much was addressed in terms of recreational activities or recreation facilities. In the early twentieth century, the social conditions of the city changed dramatically, and supervised recreational activities became a subject of interest. The twentieth century also marked the development of playgrounds around the city. In 1912, there were no playgrounds; by 1947 there were 121.

{"id": "2281029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281029", "title": "1989 Tour de France", "text": "1989 Tour de France\n\nThe 1989 Tour de France was the 76th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race consisted of 21 stages and a prologue, over . It started on 1 July 1989 in Luxembourg before taking an anti-clockwise route through France to finish in Paris on 23 July. The race was won by Greg LeMond of the team. It was the second overall victory for the American, who had spent the previous two seasons recovering from a near-fatal hunting accident. In second place was previous two-time Tour winner Laurent Fignon (), ahead of Pedro Delgado (), the defending champion.\n\nDelgado started the race as the favourite, but lost almost three minutes on his principal rivals when he missed his start time in the prologue individual time trial. The race turned out to be a two-man battle between LeMond and Fignon, with the pair trading off the race leader's yellow jersey several times. Fignon managed to match LeMond in the prologue, but in the other three individual time trials he lost time to LeMond, who took advantage of aerodynamic elbow-rest handlebars formerly used in triathlon events. Delgado launched several attacks in the mountain stages to eventually finish third, while LeMond rode defensively to preserve his chances. Fignon rode well in the mountains, including a strong performance at Alpe d'Huez which gave him the race lead on stage 17.\n\nIn the closest Tour in history, LeMond was trailing Fignon by fifty seconds at the start of the final stage, an individual time trial into Paris. LeMond was not expected to be able to make up this deficit, but he completed the stage at an average speed of , the fastest individual time trial ever ridden in the Tour de France up to that point, and won the stage. Fignon's time was fifty-eight seconds slower than LeMond's, costing him the victory and giving LeMond his second Tour title by a margin of only eight seconds. From stage 5 onward, LeMond and Fignon were the only two men to lead the race. The two riders were never separated by more than fifty-three seconds throughout the event. Owing to its competitive nature, the 1989 Tour is often ranked among the best in the race's history.\n\nThe team was the winner of the team classification and had four cyclists in the top ten of the general classification. They also won four of the five secondary individual classifications: Sean Kelly won both the points and intermediate sprints classifications, Gert-Jan Theunisse won the mountains classification and Steven Rooks won the combination classification. The young rider classification was won by Fabrice Philipot from the Toshiba team.\n\nThe 1989 Tour had a starting field of twenty-two teams of nine cyclists. Prior to 1989, the Société du Tour de France, organisers of the Tour, chose freely which teams they invited to the event. For 1989, the sport's governing body, the \"Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel\" (FICP), demanded that the highest-ranked teams in the FICP Road World Rankings would receive an automatic invitation. The Tour organisers relented in exchange for being allowed to run the race over 23 days instead of the original 21-day period given by the FICP.\n\nEighteen teams received their invitations through the FICP rankings, while the organisers allocated four teams with wild cards. The Ariostea team would have been eligible to start through their ranking, but decided against competing. This allowed Greg LeMond's team to enter the race. The wild cards were given out to the teams of , , , and . Not invited was the Teka team, which failed to accumulate enough points in the World Rankings after Reimund Dietzen had to leave the 1989 Vuelta a España following a career-ending crash. Of the 198 cyclists starting the race, 39 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The youngest rider was Jean-Claude Colotti (), who turned 22 years old on the day of the prologue; the oldest, at 36 years and 139 days, was Helmut Wechselberger ().\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\n\nBefore the 1989 Tour began, Pedro Delgado (), the defending champion, was considered a strong favourite to win the race. He had taken the title the previous year in convincing fashion, with a lead of over seven minutes. Prior to the Tour, Delgado had also won the 1989 Vuelta a España, and was therefore considered to be in good form. However, controversy around a failed doping test during the 1988 Tour put a cloud of suspicion over the reigning champion.\n\nNext to Delgado, Laurent Fignon () was also given a good chance for overall victory. The Frenchman had won the Tour in 1983 and 1984, but his form in subsequent years had been inconsistent. According to German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\", the cycling world had \"written [Fignon] off\" during four years with few victories after 1984. In 1989 however, a victory at Milan–San Remo and more importantly, the three-week Grand Tour in Italy, the Giro d'Italia, had propelled Fignon back into the spotlight. A strong Super U team surrounding him was also considered to be in his favour.\n\nStephen Roche () had won the Tour in 1987 ahead of Delgado, but missed the race in 1988 with a knee injury. A strong spring season with victory at the Tour of the Basque Country, second place at Paris–Nice and a top-ten placing at the Giro d'Italia made it seem that Roche was finding his form again.\n\nSeveral other riders were named as favourites for a high place in the general classification. Charly Mottet (), fourth overall in 1987, had won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré shortly before the Tour started and was ranked number one in the FICP Road World Rankings, a position that had been held by Sean Kelly () for five straight years. Kelly had never been a strong contender for the general classification, despite an overall victory at the 1988 Vuelta a España. Next to targeting a high place in the overall rankings, Kelly hoped to secure a record-breaking fourth win in the points classification. Kelly's PDM squad also had two talented Dutch riders in their ranks with hopes of a high finish: Steven Rooks, who had been second the year before, and Gert-Jan Theunisse. Since PDM had elected not to start either the Giro d'Italia or the Vuelta a España earlier in the season, the team hoped that their riders, without an additional three-week race in their legs, would be fresher than their rivals. Other favourites included Erik Breukink (Panasonic–Isostar), Andrew Hampsten (), Steve Bauer (), Fabio Parra () and Robert Millar ().\n\nAccording to \"Sports Illustrated\", Greg LeMond's \"name was never mentioned among the pre-race favourites\". LeMond had finished every Tour he had entered up to this point on the podium, including the first-ever victory for an American rider in 1986. His career was interrupted when he was accidentally shot by his brother-in-law in a hunting accident on Easter of 1987. About 60 pellets hit his body; his life was saved by emergency surgery, but LeMond struggled to return to professional cycling, leaving the successful PDM team at the end of 1988 and joining the relatively small ADR team. His team was not considered strong enough to help him during stage races, and ADR's financial troubles meant that LeMond had not been paid by his team in 1989 before the Tour started. Even the fee for late entry into the Tour was secured only when LeMond arranged additional sponsorship. With poor performances at both the inaugural Tour de Trump and the Giro d'Italia, LeMond's chances at the Tour de France looked slim. However, he had placed second in the final-stage individual time trial at the Giro, taking more than a minute out of eventual winner Fignon. This led to Super U's team manager Cyrille Guimard commenting to Fignon: \"LeMond will be dangerous at the Tour.\"\n\nThe route of the 1989 Tour was unveiled in October 1988. With a distance of , it was the shortest edition of the Tour in more than eighty years. The race started on 1 July with a prologue individual time trial, followed by 21 stages. On the second day of the race, two stages were held: a plain road stage followed by a team time trial. There was a transfer from Wasquehal to Dinard on a rest day between stages 4 and 5, and a second transfer between L'Isle-d'Abeau and Versailles after the finish of the penultimate stage. The second rest day was after the mountain time trial stage 15. The race lasted 23 days, including the two rest days, and ended on 23 July.\n\nThe race started outside France, in Luxembourg, and passed through the Wallonia region of Belgium, before taking an anti-clockwise route through France, starting in the northwest in Brittany before visiting the Pyrenees and then the Alps. The race consisted of seven mountain stages, two in the Pyrenees and five in the Alps. The highest point of elevation in the race was the Col du Galibier at . In total there were five time trial events including the prologue. Pedro Delgado pointed to stage 17 up the Alpe d'Huez, one of the most prominent mountain-top finishes of the Tour, as the stage most likely to decide the outcome of the race. Unusually, the last of the time trials was held on the last stage of the race, finishing on the Champs-Élysées. This had been the idea of former race director Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet, who had taken over the position from Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan in May 1987. Naquet-Radiguet was unpopular in France and was replaced by Jean-Marie Leblanc before the 1989 route was announced, but the final-day time trial remained. It was the first time that the Tour ended with a time trial since 1968, when Jan Janssen overcame a 16-second deficit to Herman Van Springel to win the Tour by 38 seconds, the smallest margin up to 1989.\n\nThe prologue time trial in Luxembourg City was won by Erik Breukink, with the second to fourth places taken by Laurent Fignon, Sean Kelly, and Greg LeMond, all six seconds slower. The dominant story of the day was Pedro Delgado. Having warmed up away from the crowd a few hundred yards from the start ramp, he missed his start time with his team unable to find him. He eventually left 2:40 minutes after his designated start, with what time he missed being added on. He eventually finished last on the stage, 2:54 minutes down on Breukink. Though he had conceded only a third of his winning margin from the previous year's Tour, and was therefore still not to be counted out, riders such as Fignon felt that \"victory in the Tour was already a distant memory for him\" at this stage.\n\nDelgado would lose even more time on the second day of the race. On the first stage, Acácio da Silva () won from a breakaway group to become the first Portuguese rider to wear the yellow jersey. Delgado attacked from the peloton (the main field) on the final steep climb before the finish, but he was brought back into the field. In the team time trial in the afternoon, Delgado fell further back as he struggled to keep up and his Reynolds team finished last on the stage. He was still in last place on the general classification, almost ten minutes behind the yellow jersey. The race lead was retained by da Silva, but the victory went to Fignon's Super U team. Fignon was now in third place, having taken 51 seconds out of LeMond, whose ADR squad finished fifth.\n\nThe third stage, finishing at the racing circuit of Spa-Francorchamps, was won by Raúl Alcalá (), who got the best of a five-man breakaway group up the climb to the line. Da Silva retained the jersey and would do so the next day as well. The fourth stage, which contained cobbled sections, was won by Jelle Nijdam (Superconfex–Yoko). He rode away from the peloton before the finish and held on with three seconds in hand at the line.\n\nIn the stage 5 time trial, LeMond won both the time trial and the yellow jersey, taking the lead in the Tour by five seconds ahead of Fignon. Delgado placed second on the stage, 24 seconds behind, with Fignon in third a further 32 seconds behind. LeMond's victory was aided by the use of aerodynamic elbow-rest handlebars, formerly seen in triathlon events, which allowed him a more aerodynamic position on the bike. The 7-Eleven team had used them at the Tour de Trump earlier in the year and LeMond adopted their use for the two flat time trials in the Tour de France to great effect. Fignon and his team manager Cyrille Guimard felt that the tribars were not within the regulations, since they only allowed three support points for the rider on the bike. However, they did not issue a complaint, a fact lamented by Fignon in his 2010 autobiography. Delgado rode a strong time trial, supported by favourable weather conditions as he competed in the dry, while later starters had to get through the rain. Kelly meanwhile lost more than five minutes to LeMond, after having to throw up about into the stage.\n\nStage 6, the longest of the race, proved unremarkable to the main classifications, but produced a human interest story: French \"domestique\" Joël Pelier (BH) had never been watched in his professional career by his mother, who was dedicated to caring for Pelier's severely disabled sibling. Unbeknownst to Pelier, his parents were waiting for him at the finish line, with his brother in a residential home for the week. Pelier, spurred on by his team manager, attacked with of the windy and wet stage remaining. He held an advantage of up to 25 minutes at one point, but suffered during the later part. Eventually, he won the stage one-and-a-half minutes ahead of the field and had a teary reunion with his parents. It was then the second-longest breakaway in Tour de France history after Albert Bourlon's in 1947, and has since been surpassed by Thierry Marie.\n\nThe next two stages were relatively uneventful. Stage 7 was won by Etienne De Wilde () from a group of four riders who were slightly clear of the field. The next day, a four-man breakaway stayed clear of the peloton, with Martin Earley () taking victory. Fignon put in an attack during the stage, but was brought back.\n\nThe race entered the high mountains for the first time on the next two stages, as the Tour visited the Pyrenees. On stage 9 from Pau to Cauterets, future five-time Tour winner Miguel Induráin () attacked on the bottom of the Col d'Aubisque and led the race for the rest of the day. He was followed by two riders of the BH team, Anselmo Fuerte and Javier Murguialday. At one point Induráin was more than six minutes ahead of the group containing the race favourites; he slowed during the final ascent at Cauterets, but held on to the stage win ahead of Fuerte by 27 seconds. Behind them, Mottet attacked from the peloton, with Delgado following and soon overtaking him. Delgado finished third on the stage and regained 27 seconds on Fignon and LeMond. It was on this stage that Fignon started to complain about LeMond riding too defensively for strategic reasons, accusing him of not putting any work into counterattacks. He later wrote in his autobiography: \"All he did was sit tight and take advantage of the work I put in. To be honest, it was extremely frustrating.\" LeMond defended his tactics, claiming that as the leader it was not for him to push. Former race winner Stephen Roche hit his already injured knee on his handlebars on the descent of the Col de Marie-Blanque, reaching the finish under extreme pain many minutes behind the other favourites. He did not start the next stage.\nThe second Pyrenean stage ended at the ski resort of Superbagnères. Robert Millar and Mottet attacked on the approach to the climb of the Col du Tourmalet. Behind them, Fignon suffered a weak moment on the climb and allegedly held on to a photographer riding on a motorcycle, without the race directors handing out any punishment for the offence. Delgado attacked towards the end of the climb and reached Millar and Mottet after the descent of the Tourmalet. Together, they reached Superbagnères, where Delgado was provoked by an over-enthusiastic spectator and threw a bidon at him. Delgado then moved clear but was recaptured by Millar, who took the stage victory. Mottet was third, 19 seconds down. Rooks and Gert-Jan Theunisse led the next group, containing Fignon, into the finish. Fignon attacked LeMond within the final kilometre of the stage, taking twelve seconds on the general classification and with it the yellow jersey. The order in the overall standings after these two mountain stages was Fignon ahead of LeMond by seven seconds, followed by Mottet a further 50 seconds behind. Delgado had moved up to fourth, now within three minutes of Fignon.\n\nStage 11 from Luchon to Blagnac had a flat profile. Rudy Dhaenens () attacked from a six-man breakaway just as it was caught by the peloton. With just a couple of hundred metres left and the stage win almost certainly in his hands, Dhaenens misjudged his speed going through a corner and crashed, allowing the rest of the field to pass him. Mathieu Hermans won the stage for the Paternina team in a sprint finish. During the course of the stage, the only remaining riders abandoned, pre-race favourite Fabio Parra and José-Hipolito Roncancio. Stage 12 was interrupted by an ecologists' protests against a new waste plant, which aided a breakaway by Valerio Tebaldi () and Giancarlo Perini (). A crash in the peloton, impacting about 30 riders, further hindered the field. Tebaldi won the two-man sprint to take the stage 21 minutes ahead of the main field, the second highest post-World War II margin between a stage winner and rest of the field behind only José Viejo's 22:50 minutes on stage 11 of the 1976 Tour de France.\n\nStage 13 was held on the Bastille Day bicentenary, the 200th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution and France's main national holiday. The PDM team, on the insistence of their team director, attacked in the feed zone of the stage, thereby violating the unwritten rules of the field. They were brought back, but the acceleration split the peloton into two parts. Fignon attacked from the first group with Mottet. Both stayed out ahead for about an hour before being recaptured. Then, two other riders broke free, Vincent Barteau () and Jean-Claude Colotti. Barteau left Colotti behind on the hills around the finishing city of Marseille and went on to win the stage. Delgado was handed a ten-second time penalty for illegally accepting food outside the feed zone, while pre-race favourite Breukink retired from the race about from the finish.\n\nThe next stage saw a repeat of Nijdam's stage 4 exploits: he again broke free of the field shortly before the finish line and held off his pursuers to take victory. The day's breakaway, which included Luis Herrera (Café de Colombia), a pre-race contender who had so far disappointed, was caught within the last of the stage.\n\nThe following five stages took the riders through the Alps. The first of these, stage 15, was an individual time trial to the ski station at Orcières-Merlette. Induráin set an early standard with a time of 1:11:25 hours, only to be outdone six minutes later by Rooks, who improved on Induráin's time by 43 seconds. Theunisse was fastest up the second of the two climbs of the course, gathering more points in the mountains classification to move clear of rival Millar. Of the true contenders for the overall victory, Delgado set the fastest times at all the check points, but slowed on the last climb to eventually finish the stage fourth, 48 seconds down on Rooks. He attributed his time loss to a worsening callus that would influence him for the remainder of the race. Behind Rooks, Marino Lejarreta (Paternina) was second fastest, moving into the top five overall. LeMond meanwhile took back the yellow jersey from Fignon, finishing fifth on the stage, just nine seconds slower than Delgado. His advantage over Fignon at this stage was 40 seconds.\n\nThe day after the second rest day, on the stage from Gap to Briançon, the riders faced the climbs of the Col de Vars and the Col d'Izoard. On the first of these climbs, Fignon and Mottet dropped back from the group of favourites, while LeMond stayed close to Delgado. Fignon and Mottet got back to the group on the descent, only for Delgado to attack on the climb of the Izoard. He was joined by LeMond, Theunisse and Mottet, while Fignon fell back once again. LeMond attacked after the descent, but on the slightly rising road towards the finish, Delgado made contact again to finish within the same time. Fignon meanwhile lost 13 seconds on LeMond. The two were now separated by 53 seconds in the general classification, the widest the margin would be the entire Tour. Up ahead, Pascal Richard () won the stage from a breakaway.\nStage 17, which finished at Alpe d'Huez, one of the most famous climbs in cycling, was expected to be the decisive part of the race overall. Theunisse, wearing the polka-dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification, attacked on the first climb, the Col du Galibier. He was joined by two more riders, Franco Vona () and Laurent Biondi (Fagor–MBK) before the ascent of the Col de la Croix de Fer, but rode away from his breakaway companions before he reached the summit. At Le Bourg-d'Oisans, the village before the climb to Alpe d'Huez starts, he led the group of favourites by more than four minutes and held on to win the stage by over a minute. Behind him, the battle for the yellow jersey intensified. Fignon, LeMond and Delgado entered the climb together and Fignon instantly attacked at the first hairpin bend. LeMond stuck to his wheel, but Guimard, knowing LeMond well from their days together at the Renault team, saw that he was struggling. He drew his team car level with Fignon and ordered him to attack again with to go to the finish line. LeMond fell back and only Delgado was able to keep up with Fignon. The two reached the finish together, 1:19 minutes ahead of LeMond. Fignon thus regained the yellow jersey, with an advantage of 26 seconds over LeMond.\n\nThe following stage to Villard-de-Lans featured a breakaway, including previous stage winners Millar and Richard. They were brought back once the race reached the Côte de Saint-Nizier climb, with only Herrera left ahead of the peloton. As the field made contact with Herrera, Fignon attacked. LeMond, Delgado and Theunisse followed him but unwillingness to work together allowed Fignon to extend his advantage. He passed the summit of the climb 15 seconds clear of his pursuers and in the valley behind, a group containing Alcalá and Kelly caught up to the three chasers. Fignon started the final climb up to the finish with a margin of 45 seconds. He took the stage win, but his advantage was reduced to 24 seconds by the time LeMond crossed the line, meaning that the difference between the two was now 50 seconds in the overall standings.\n\nStage 19 was the last one in the Alps and finished in Aix-les-Bains. Already by the second climb of the day, the Col de Porte, the top-four riders on the general classification, Fignon, LeMond, Delgado and Theunisse, joined by seventh-placed Lejarreta, had pulled clear. Behind, Mottet, sitting fifth overall, was struggling and would relinquish his position to Lejarreta by the end of the stage. On the race's last climb, the Col du Granier, LeMond attacked repeatedly, but Fignon followed him every time. Going into the town of Chambéry, site of the World Championships one month later, Lejarreta misjudged a roundabout and crashed, taking all riders with him but Delgado, who waited for the others to remount and join him. The five riders settled the stage win in a sprint finish, with LeMond taking the honours, although the difference between him and Fignon in the overall standings remained at 50 seconds.\n\nWith the final-stage time trial to Paris looming ahead, the field took a steady pace on stage 20 from Aix-les-Baines to L'Isle d'Abeau. Fignon put in a less-than-serious attack, but was quickly brought back. In the run-in to the finish, Phil Anderson () attacked, but was recaptured. Then, about from the line, Nijdam attempted to go for a third stage win, but was beaten to the line by Giovanni Fidanza (Chateau d'Ax), with Kelly taking third.\nAfter stage 19, Fignon had developed saddle sores, which gave him pain and made it impossible to sleep the night before the time trial. He was however still confident that he would not lose his 50-second advantage on LeMond during the from Versailles to the Champs-Élysées. In the final-day time trial, LeMond again opted for the aerodynamic handlebars, a tear-drop helmet, and a rear disc wheel. Fignon meanwhile used two disc wheels, but ordinary handlebars and was bareheaded, his ponytail moving in the wind. When Fignon reached the half-distance time check, LeMond had taken 21 seconds out of his lead. LeMond finished with a time of 26:57 minutes, the fastest-ever time trial in the history of the Tour, at . As LeMond collapsed on the floor from exhaustion, Fignon made his way to the finish. He ended with a time of 27:55 minutes. With an average speed of , it was the fastest time trial he had ever ridden. Nevertheless, he finished third on the stage, 58 seconds down on LeMond, and therefore lost the race by the slight margin of eight seconds. A November 1989 \"Bicycling\" article, supported by wind-tunnel data, estimated that LeMond may have gained one minute on Fignon through the use of the new aerobars. , eight seconds is still the smallest winning margin in Tour de France history. Further down the classification, Millar lost ninth place to Kelly during the final-day time trial. Hermans became the second-ever stage winner to finish the Tour de France in last place, after Pietro Tarchini in 1947. He had already been the \"lanterne rouge\" in the 1987 Tour. Of the 198 starters, 138 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\n\nLeMond's unexpected Tour victory resulted in significant media attention, with sports writer Nige Tassell describing it in 2017 as \"now the biggest sports story of them all\". Not only had LeMond overcome a significant time deficit, he had also won the Tour after coming back from a near-fatal hunting accident. Owing \nto its small margin of victory and exciting racing, the 1989 Tour has repeatedly been named as one of the best editions of all time. In 2009, journalist Keith Bingham called it \"the greatest Tour of them all\", while Cyclingnews.com in 2013 described it as \"arguably the best [Tour] there's ever been\". American media, traditionally not overly interested in cycling, made his victory headline news and TV broadcasters interrupted their regular programming to break the news. \"Sports Illustrated\", who named LeMond their Sportsperson of the Year, called it a \"heroic comeback\". A month after the Tour, LeMond also won the Road World Championship race in Chambéry, with Fignon coming in sixth. Owing to LeMond's overall victory, ADR received the largest share of the prize money, at £185,700, followed by £129,000 for PDM and £112,700 for Super U. However, ADR became the lowest-ranked team in the history of the Tour up to that point to include the overall winner, placing 17th in the team classification. Apart from LeMond, only three other ADR riders finished the race, all more than two hours behind him.\n\nStill not having been paid by ADR, LeMond signed a three-year contract worth $5.5 million with for the 1990 season, the then-richest contract in the sport's history. He would go on to win a third Tour the following year, before finishing seventh in 1991 and retiring in 1994. Fignon on the other hand struggled with the disappointment of losing the Tour by such a small margin and the ridicule directed at him because of it. In 2016, his wife revealed that he did not set foot on the Champs-Élysées for the rest of his life, even though he lived in Paris. He continued his career, without much success, never coming close to winning the Tour again. A sixth-place finish in 1991 was followed by 23rd overall the following year. He retired in 1993, having won his last Tour stage in 1992.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1989 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. Just as in the three previous editions of the Tour, no time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded at the finish of each stage. However, during the first half of the race, the first three riders crossing an intermediate sprint were given 6, 4, and 2 bonus seconds respectively. Greg LeMond won the general classification. Laurent Fignon spent the most stages as leader with nine ahead of LeMond's eight. During the race, the leader changed seven times. The only other two riders to lead the general classification in 1989 were Erik Breukink for one day after the prologue and then Acácio da Silva for the four days subsequent to Breukink. Pedro Delgado wore the yellow jersey on the prologue as the winner of the previous edition.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. High finishes on flat stages awarded more points, 45 for the winner down to 1 point for 25th place. In mountain stages and time trials, 15 points were given to the winner down to 1 point for 15th. The first three riders across intermediate sprints received points; 4, 2, and 1 respectively. Sean Kelly won this classification for a record fourth time, a record since broken by both Erik Zabel and Peter Sagan.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\" (beyond categorization), first, second, third, or fourth-category, with the lower-numbered categories representing harder climbs. Points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Mountains ranked \"hors catégorie\" gave 40 points for the first rider across with the subsequent categories giving 30, 20, 7, and 4 points to the first at the summit respectively. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots. Gert-Jan Theunisse won the mountain's jersey with a lead of over a 100 points.\n\nFor the last time, there was a combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications (except young rider), with the leader of each classification receiving 25 points down to one point for 25th place. The leader wore the combination jersey. Steven Rooks won this classification, defending his title from the previous year's Tour. Also for the last time, the intermediate sprints classification was calculated. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but points were only awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey. During the first half of the race, 6, 4, and 2 points were awarded, in the second half the number was increased to 15, 10, and 5 points respectively. Kelly won the jersey for a third time in his career, which made him the record winner in this classification.\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was decided in the same way as the general classification, but was limited to riders under 25 years old. In 1989, for the first time since 1975, the leading rider in this classification did not wear the white jersey that had previously been used to identify the classification leader. The white jersey would be reintroduced in 2000. While no jersey was given to the leader, he was still marked by wearing the logo of the European Union on his shoulder. This was the only edition of the race in which this badge was used. The Café de Colombia team forgot to register their rider Alberto Camargo for the classification even though he would have been eligible. Had he been entered, he would have been the winner, as he finished the race in 20th place. Instead, the classification was won by Fabrice Philipot (), who had placed 24th overall.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps. The team points classification was abolished ahead of the 1989 Tour. However, the combined points from the points classification would be used as a tiebreaker if two teams were to be tied on time. The team classification was won by .\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Fignon won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. Commemorating the bicentennial anniversary of the French Revolution, a cash prize of 17,890 francs was given out to the first rider passing the 1,789th kilometre of the race at Martres-Tolosane, on stage 11 between Luchon and Blagnac. The prize was taken by Jos Haex (). The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 17. This prize was won by Laurent Biondi (). There was also a Souvenir in honour of five-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil, who had died two years before, given to the rider who wore the yellow jersey for the most days. This award was won by Fignon, who held the jersey for nine days.\n\nRiders in the Tour competed individually for points that contributed towards the FICP individual ranking. At the end of the Tour, Laurent Fignon replaced Charly Mottet as the leader of the ranking.\n\nIn total, 87 doping tests were performed during the 1989 Tour de France; all of them were negative. The tests were carried out by the \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" medical inspector, Gerry McDaid.\n\n"}

{"id": "2281037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281037", "title": "Emaciation", "text": "Emaciation\n\nEmaciation is defined as extreme weight loss and unnatural thinness due to a loss of subcutaneous fat (the fatty, or adipose tissue beneath the skin) and muscle throughout the body. It affects human beings and animals; one who is emaciated could be described as \"wasting away\" or being \"gaunt.\" Emaciation is caused by severe malnourishment and starvation. Emaciation is a predominant symptom of malnourishment, a basic component of poverty and famine that also occurs with diseases that interfere with the digestive system and appetite, other systems, and eating disorders. These include nutrient deficiency disorders, diseases with prolonged fever and infection, malignant diseases, parasitic infections that can result from contamination, anorexia nervosa and other conditions. The malnourishment associated with emaciation has been referred to as \"inanition\", while infection by parasites has been described as \"adulteration\". Treatment of emaciation includes gradual renourishment with a slow increase of daily caloric intake to help rebuild tissues and regain weight. Rest, and emotional and psychological therapy and support may be included.\n\nIn humans, the overall physical appearance of emaciation includes a thinning of the limbs, upper body and buttocks to an almost skeletal-seeming state with an apparent absence of fat and muscle tone. The skin is thin, dry and translucent in some areas of the body, to the point that veins beneath the skin are somewhat visible. The face is thin and drawn with a hopeless, vacant and distressed demeanor; the eye sockets are sunken, giving the eyes a bulging appearance. The scalp is bony with dry, withering hair that is lacking. On the torso, the collar bone, chest bone and ribs are quite pronounced; the stomach is bloated, which indicates gastrointestinal distress associated with nutritional depletion. The mouth and tongue may be excessively dry, or moist with the tongue thickly coated; there is usually strong halitosis, or foul breath.\n\nThere is great fatigue, inability and lack of physical effort in the emaciated. Mental efficiency, problem solving and reasoning are somewhat impaired. The emotional state of an emaciated individual is often poor; feelings of depression, hopelessness, fear, anxiety and worthlessness may prevail.\n\nThe underlying starvation, malnourishment, and usually dehydration, associated with emaciation, affect and are harmful to organ systems throughout the body. The emaciated individual experiences disturbances of the blood, circulatory, and urinary systems; these include hyponatremia and/or hypokalemia (low sodium and/or potassium in the blood, respectively), anemia (low hemoglobin), improper function of lymph (immune system-related white blood matter) and the lymphatic system, and pleurisy (fluid in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs) and edema (swelling in general) caused by poor or improper function of the kidneys to eliminate wastes from the blood.\n\nIn most of Africa, poverty, malnutrition and disease are common. Among third world countries, India is one of the leading countries plagued by malnutrition, with more than 200 million people affected. Emaciation in India is referred to as \"shosha roga\", which means \"exploitative disease\". Diseases such as these are nutrient deficiency disorders that can cause varying degrees of emaciation based on the type of nutrient(s) chronically and persistently lacking or absent from the diet of an individual.\n\nEmaciation was also a major cause of death in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. It was largely the result of a starvation diet imposed on the inmates. It became endemic during the last stages of the war when rations were restricted even further. \n\nIt can also occur if a prisoner, often for a political cause or in plead of innocence, refuses food on a hunger strike or is forcibly fed but unable to retain the fluids or maintain nutrition. \n\nRestrictive diets can lead to significant weight loss, as can psychological problems, depression and social problems and issues. Anorexia nervosa is the psychological disease of a denial of weight loss and thinness while maintaining the same physical activity; Certain digestive diseases can induce weight loss. Diseases often associated with weight loss include tuberculosis, HIV infection, endocarditis or chronic inflammatory disease with febrile vasculitis, Behcet's disease, connective, Still's disease, sarcoidosis, and certain cancers or blood diseases. Some neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease may also cause significant weight loss. Poisoning such as chronic alcoholism, drug addiction or taking drugs by mistake are also common causes. Taking too much medication is a possible cause of weight loss in the elderly and weak, if the medication suppresses appetite.\n\nFamine and third world conditions are usually involved. Severe emaciation can be caused by marasmus, a disorder that is seen in children who are deprived of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Both weight and growth are affected. A similar disorder, seen in very young malnourished children, is kwashiorkor. With emaciation mostly confined to the upper body, kwashiorkor often occurs after a child has been weaned and thus deprived of protein it was getting from its mother's milk. Slight emaciation is seen with nutrition disorders such as beriberi, caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1), and pellagra, caused by insufficient intake of niacin (vitamin B3). The former is mainly characterized by mental impairment, and the latter is more serious, often leading to death.\n\nOther diseases and disorders associated with emaciation include malaria and cholera, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases with prolonged fever, parasitic infections, many forms of cancer and their treatments, lead poisoning, and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa.\n\nOther than treating, curing or remedying the underlying cause of emaciation, it as a symptom is treated by regaining the weight and restoring the tissues. This is done through renourishment, or reintroducing nourishing liquids and foods to the body while increasing the intake of food energy. The process, usually begun in an individual deprived of food for a period of time, must be done slowly to avoid complications such as regurgitation and vomiting. It begins with spoonfuls of water and salted broth, advancing to increased amounts of clear liquids including broth, tea and fruit juices. This soon is advanced to full liquid diet such as milk (if no lactose intolerance is present) and cream-based soups. Once solid food is introduced, an emaciated individual is usually given up to eight small meals per day, at two-hour intervals. Meals may consist of a small milkshake to minor portions of meat with a starchy side item. For the purposes of weight gain and tissue rebuilding, the diet will be focused on proteins, fats and carbohydrates that are rich in vitamins and minerals, and relatively high in energy. Oily foods and high-fiber foods like grains and certain vegetables are discouraged because they are difficult to digest, and filling while lower in energy. Treatment of emaciation also includes much sleep, rest and relaxation, and counseling.\n\nThe appearance and effects of emaciation in animals, both wild and domestic, is like that of humans–severe thinness, loss of fat and muscle, extremely pronounced and protruding bones, and weakness. Starvation and regularly dehydration, brought on by neglect and cruelty from humans, or as a result of illness are the usual causes of emaciation in domestic animals like dogs, cats and horses; in wild animals, starvation with emaciation is caused by unavailable sources of food, loss or changes of habitat, or neglect in captivity. The rehabilitation of emaciated animals, through treating their starvation and dehydration with slow renourishment, can be challenging. The unique and specific physiological and dietary needs of animals, be they mammals, birds, reptiles, carnivores, herbivores, etc. are carefully considered to avoid causing harm.\n\n"}

Variants of his name are Hellesthaeus, Ellestheaeus, Eleshaah, Ellesboas, and Elesboam.\n\nAt Aksum, in inscription RIE 191, his name is rendered in unvocalized Gə‘əz as KLB ’L ’ṢBḤ WLD TZN (Kaleb ʾElla ʾAṣbeḥa, son of Tazena). In vocalized Gə‘əz, it is (Kaleb ʾƎllä ʾAṣbəḥa).\n\nKaleb, a name derived from the Biblical character Caleb, is his given name; on both his coins and inscriptions he left at Axum, as well as Ethiopian hagiographical sources and king lists, he refers to himself as the son of Tazena.\n\nProcopius, John of Ephesus, and other contemporary historians recount Kaleb's invasion of Yemen around 520, against the Himyarite king, Yusuf Asar Yathar, known as Dhu Nuwas, a Jew who was persecuting the Christian community of Najran. After much fighting, Kaleb's soldiers eventually routed Yusuf's forces and killed the king, allowing Kaleb to appoint Sumuafa' Ashawa', a native Christian (named Esimiphaios by Procopius), as his viceroy of Himyar.\n\nAs a result of his protection of the Christians, Kaleb is known as Saint Elesbaan after the sixteenth-century Cardinal Caesar Baronius added him to his edition of the \"Roman Martyrology\" despite his being a miaphysite. However, the question of whether Miaphysitism—the actual Christology of Oriental Orthodoxy, including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria)—was a heresy is a question which remains to this day.\nAxumite control of Arabia Felix continued until c.525 when Sumuafa' Ashawa' was deposed by Abraha, who made himself king. Procopius states that Kaleb made several unsuccessful attempts to recover his overseas territory; however, his successor later negotiated a peace with Abraha, where Abraha acknowledged the Axumite king's authority and paid tribute. Munro-Hay opines that by this expedition Axum overextended itself, and this final intervention across the Red Sea, \"was Aksum's swan-song as a great power in the region.\"\n\nA historical record survives of a meeting between the Byzantine ambassador and historian Nonnosus and Kaleb in the year 530. \n\nEthiopian tradition states that Kaleb eventually abdicated his throne, gave his crown to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and retired to a monastery.\n\nLater historians who recount the events of King Kaleb's reign include ibn Hisham, ibn Ishaq, and al-Tabari. Taddesse Tamrat records a tradition he heard from an aged priest in Lalibela that \"Kaleb was a man of Lasta and his palace was at Bugna where it is known that Gebre Mesqel Lalibela had later established his centre. The relevance of this tradition for us is the mere association of the name of Kaleb with the evangelization of this interior province of Aksum.\"\n\nBesides several inscriptions bearing his name, Axum also contains a pair of ruined structures, one said to be his tomb and its partner said to be the tomb of his son, Gabra Masqal. (Tradition gives him a second son, Israel, whom it has been suggested is identical with king Israel of Axum.) This structure was first examined as an archaeological subject by Henry Salt in the early 19th century; almost a century later, it was partially cleared and mapped out by the Deutsche Aksum-Expedition in 1906. The most recent excavation of this tomb was in 1973 by the British Institute in Eastern Africa.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates Kaleb as \"\"Saint Elesbaan, King of Ethiopia\"\" on 24 October (O.S.) / 6 November (N.S.).\n\n\n"}

United States, 242 U.S. 470 (1917), was a United States Supreme Court case involving Farley Drew Caminetti and the Mann Act. The Court decided that the Mann Act applied not only to purposes of prostitution but also to other noncommercial consensual sexual liaisons. Thus, consensual extramarital sex falls within the definition of \"immoral sex.\"\n\nThe case has a historic place in American jurisprudence in that it was one of the first where the court embraced the idea of the “plain meaning rule”. This is a form of legislative interpretation that focuses strongly on the literal text of a statute. In its most extreme form the plain meaning rule does not look outside of the statutory text at any additional sources to find the legislative intent if the rule is \"plain\" from the text. Critics of using the plain meaning rule argue that a court may find or not find an ambiguity in a statute depending on the end result that a court sees fit.\n\nThe issue in the case that caused the Court to interpret using the plain meaning rule was whether the Mann Act's inclusion of the phrase “...or for any other immoral purpose...” included Caminetti's actions. The Court found that Caminetti had been convicted of transporting a woman across state lines for an immoral purpose which, according to the majority opinion, was well within the plain meaning of the statute.\n\n\n\n"}

The band signed to Ferret Music in mid-2000 and was planning to record its first album later in the year. After writing was completed in December of that year, the band went on several US tours until March 2001. In March and April, \"Last Night in Town\" was recorded with the Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz at Zing Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts. Following recording, the band went on tour with Killswitch Engage and Santa Sangre.\n\n\"Last Night in Town\" was first released on August 14, 2001. The album received positive reviews with critics praising the band's chaotic sound showcased on the album. It was reissued in June 2004 with new artwork.\n\nIt was pressed on vinyl by Suburban Home Records in December 2006 as part of a box with \"Hot Damn!\" (2003) and \"Gutter Phenomenon\" (2005).\n\nEvery Time I Die was formed in 1998 by two brothers, the vocalist Keith Buckley and the guitarist Jordan Buckley.

Taylor called the album \"a cathartic, chaotic release\", and continued, \"The listener will go from being stunned to outright jaw-dropping incredulity.\" He said that the record was very comparable to Drowningman in the regard that both bands are able to \"flawlessly twist your mind into a pretzel and then straighten it back out with the occasional melody\". Taylor concluded his review by saying that the \"reluctance to remove the album from your stereo is surely proof enough that this is one of the most potentially amazing bands inhabiting the metalcore scene\". Mustapha Mond of \"Lambgoat\" said the album was \"as peppy as tough, crazy hardcore can get. And on top of the boots-rocking beat, ETID layers breakdown after breakdown\". He said it \"keeps up the rocking for ten powerful tracks, and manages to put enough artistry into them that any one, listened to alone, will knock your socks off\".

{"id": "2281082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281082", "title": "Plain meaning rule", "text": "Plain meaning rule\n\nThe plain meaning rule, also known as the literal rule, is one of three rules of statutory construction traditionally applied by English courts. The other two are the \"mischief rule\" and the \"golden rule\".\n\nThe plain meaning rule dictates that statutes are to be interpreted using the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute. In other words, a statute is to be read word for word and is to be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language, unless a statute explicitly defines some of its terms otherwise or unless the result would be cruel or absurd. Ordinary words are given their ordinary meaning, technical terms are given their technical meaning, and local, cultural terms are recognized as applicable. The plain meaning rule is the mechanism that prevents courts from taking sides in legislative or political issues. Additionally, it is the mechanism that underlies textualism and, to a certain extent, originalism.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, legislatures often include \"definitions\" sections within a statute, which explicitly define the most important terms used in that statute. But some statutes omit a definitions section entirely, or (more commonly) fail to define a particular term. The plain meaning rule attempts to guide courts faced with litigation that turns on the meaning of a term \"not\" defined by the statute, or on that of a word found within a definition itself.\n\nAccording to the plain meaning rule, absent a contrary definition within the statute, words must be given their plain, ordinary and literal meaning. If the words are clear, they must be applied, even though the intention of the legislator may have been different or the result is harsh or undesirable. The literal rule is what the law says instead of what the law was intended to say.\n\nLarry Solum, Professor of Law at Georgetown University, expands on this premise:\nJustices normally impose an absurdity limit on this rule, which states that a statute cannot be interpreted literally if it would lead to an absurd result. In the US Supreme Court \"Chung Fook v. White\" (1924) marked the beginning of the looser American Rule that the intent of the law was more important than its text.\n\nThis is sometimes termed the \"soft plain meaning rule\", where the statute is interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language, unless the result would be cruel or absurd. For example, see \"Rector, Holy Trinity Church v. United States\", 143 U.S. 457 (1892). Even the most vocal supporters of textualism and the plain meaning rule have been willing to commute \"strict\" plain meaning to \"soft\" plain meaning to a certain extent, in some circumstances; see, e.g. \"United States v. X-Citement Video\", 513 U.S. 64 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting):\n\nIn the United Kingdom, this is referred to as the golden rule.\n\nProponents of the plain meaning rule claim that it prevents courts from taking sides in legislative or political issues. They also point out that ordinary people and lawyers do not have extensive access to secondary sources.\n\nIn probate law the rule is also favored because the testator is typically not around to indicate what interpretation of a will is appropriate. Therefore, it is argued, extrinsic evidence should not be allowed to vary the words used by the testator or their meaning. It can help to provide for consistency in interpretation.\n\nThis is the oldest of the rules of construction and is still used today, primarily because judges may not legislate. As there is always the danger that a particular interpretation may be the equivalent of making law, some judges prefer to adhere to the law's literal wording.\n\nOpponents of the plain meaning rule claim that the rule rests on the erroneous assumption that words have a fixed meaning. In fact, words are imprecise, leading justices to impose their own prejudices to determine the meaning of a statute. However, since little else is offered as an alternative discretion-confining theory, plain meaning survives.\n\nIn law, strictly literal interpretations of statutes can lead to seemingly absurd results. The doctrine of absurdity holds that commonsense interpretations should be preferred in such cases, rather than literal readings. Under the absurdity doctrine, American courts have interpreted statutes contrary to their plain meaning in order to avoid absurd legal conclusions. It is contrasted with literalism.\n\nAn explanation of the rule was given in the \"Sussex Peerage Case\" (1844; 11 Cl&Fin 85). \"The only rule for construction of Acts of Parliament is that they should be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the Act. If the words of the Statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in that natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such a case, best declare the intention of the law giver.\"\n\nHowever, use of the literal rule may defeat the intention of Parliament. For instance, in the case of \"Whiteley v. Chappel\", the court came to the reluctant conclusion that Whiteley could not be convicted of impersonating \"any person entitled to vote\" at an election, because the person he impersonated was dead. Using a literal construction of the relevant statutory provision, the deceased was not \"a person entitled to vote\".\n\nThis, surely, cannot have been the intention of Parliament. However, the literal rule does not take into account the consequences of a literal interpretation, only whether words have a clear meaning that makes sense within that context. If Parliament does not like the literal interpretation, then it must amend the legislation.\n\nThe \"plain meaning rule\" has sometimes been applied to the interpretation of contracts, particularly in conjunction with the parol evidence rule. Such a use is controversial.\n\n"}
{"id": "2281097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281097", "title": "1990 Tour de France", "text": "1990 Tour de France\n\nThe 1990 Tour de France was the 77th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 30 June and 22 July 1990. The race consisted of 21 stages and a prologue. American Greg LeMond () repeated his 1989 victory in the general classification, ahead of Claudio Chiappucci () and Erik Breukink () in second and third place respectively.\n\nThe Tour started with a prologue time trial at the Futuroscope theme park, won by Thierry Marie (). On the first stage, a four-rider group escaped and gained more than ten minutes on the rest of the field. Steve Bauer () became the new leader of the race, but faltered in the Alps as Ronan Pensec (), also from the escape group, took over the race lead. Two days later, during a mountain time trial to Villard-de-Lans, the lead passed to Claudio Chiappucci, who had been in the same group as well. Chiappucci fought to hang on to his advantage over defending champion LeMond, but was overtaken in the final time trial on the penultimate stage. It was LeMond's third Tour victory, a feat he achieved without winning an individual stage.\n\nThe points classification was won by Olaf Ludwig (), while the mountains classification was won by Thierry Claveyrolat (). Gilles Delion () was the best young rider, while Eduardo Chozas () was awarded the super-combativity prize. , the team of race winner LeMond, won the team classification.\n\nThe 1990 race was the first edition in which riders from Eastern Bloc nations participated. Ludwig became the first rider from East Germany and Dimitri Konyshev () was the first Soviet rider to win a stage at the Tour.\n\nThe 1990 Tour had a starting field of 22 teams of 9 cyclists. Of those 22, 16 teams qualified based on the FICP team rankings, while six teams were given wildcards. Notable teams who failed to qualify and were not invited were BH–Amaya Seguros and Café de Colombia with Luis Herrera, a double former winner of the mountains classification.\n\nThe largest numbers of riders from a nation came from France (35), with the next largest coming from Belgium (27), Spain (25), Italy (22), Netherlands (19), Colombia (14) and Switzerland (13). For the first time, riders from the Eastern Bloc competed in the Tour, ten in total, enabled by the changing political climate brought about by the revolutions in the Eastern Bloc countries. While several riders from Warsaw Pact nations had transferred to established Western teams, the team was made up of exclusively Soviet cyclists. Three more teams included cyclists of a single nationality: (Belgian), (Colombian), and (Italian).\n\nOf the 198 cyclists starting the race, 58 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The average age of riders in the race was 27.77 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Antonio Miguel Díaz () to the 35-year-old Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place at the lakeside arena at Futuroscope theme park, north of the city of Poitiers, west-central France, which later hosted the prologue stage.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\n\nIn the lead up to the Tour, the main contenders for the general classification were Greg LeMond (), Laurent Fignon (), Pedro Delgado () and Stephen Roche (). All four were former Tour winners. They were the preeminent stage race specialists, with each one focusing their season around the Tour.\n\nThe leading favourite was two-time Tour winner LeMond, who returned to defend his title. After winning the Tour in 1989 and the World Championship road race, LeMond had not taken another victory. He had finished Paris–Nice more than eight minutes behind the winner and struggled at the Giro d'Italia, where he placed 105th. He was considered overweight due to lack of training and had been suffering from mononucleosis. Encouraging signs came during the Tour de Suisse, just weeks before the start of the Tour de France, where he finished tenth. LeMond did not consider himself a favourite for victory going into the race, but declared that he would be disappointed should he not finish on the podium. For the first time at a Tour, LeMond had the support of his whole team, including Robert Millar, who had won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and placed second at the Tour de Suisse just prior to the start of the Tour.\n\nThe sport newspaper \"L'Équipe\" was expecting a close battle between LeMond and Fignon, who had finished in second place in 1989, only eight seconds behind LeMond. Fignon had previously won the Tour in 1983 and 1984. A crash on stage 5 of the Giro had forced Fignon to abandon the race he had won in 1989. He returned to racing at the Route du Sud and later competed in the Tour de Luxembourg as preparation for the Tour de France and had apparently overcome his injuries. Writing in his autobiography, Fignon later admitted that his crashes and poor results earlier in the season had left him \"a tired man, physically and mentally\" and that he entered the Tour with \"few illusions about what was coming\". Fignon's squad was not seen as the strongest, but they were dedicated to him and managed by Cyrille Guimard, who had led multiple riders to Tour victories.\n\nDelgado, the winner of the 1988 Tour, was in good form after placing second at the Vuelta a España earlier in the year. He was part of the strong team, with Miguel Induráin to help him in the mountains. Roche, winner of the 1987 edition, was on the start line, but still troubled by recurring knee pain. His best result of the season had been a second place behind Induráin at Paris–Nice. \n\nRoche's teammate Erik Breukink was among several other riders named as favourites. A further teammate and an Irish countryman of Roche, Sean Kelly, was the record winner of the points classification and appeared in good form, having just won the Tour de Suisse, but was thought to be working for Breukink. Spanish newspaper \"El País\" considered Delgado to be the top favourite, but also named Fignon, LeMond, and Gianni Bugno (), who had won the Giro earlier that year, as potential winners. \"Mundo Deportivo\" also named Charly Mottet () among the favourites. His best result that season had been a second place behind Bugno at the Giro. Also on the start line was Marco Giovannetti, winner of the Vuelta and third at the Giro. According to cycling journalist Geoffrey Nicholson, his ability to perform in another three-week Grand Tour was doubted from the start, and it was agreed that he only participated to ensure a wildcard entry for his team, Seur.\n\nGert-Jan Theunisse (), fourth the previous year and winner of the mountains classification, did not start due to two positive doping tests earlier in the season.\n\nThe 1990 Tour de France started on 30 June, and had two rest days. The race had its \"Grand Départ\" (opening stages) in and around the Futuroscope theme park, whose owners paid around $1 million for the right to host the beginning of the race. After two stages, both held on the same day, also at Futuroscope, the Tour took a clockwise route around France. The race traveled north towards the English Channel and then east to Rouen. A plane transfer on the first rest day brought the field to Sarrebourg on the border to Germany before the race turned south towards the Alps. On the second rest day, the Tour remained in Villard-de-Lans. The race then turned south-west to the Pyrenees before turning north again towards Paris, ending with the ceremonial Champs-Élysées stage.\n\nStage 5 from Avranches to Rouen was the longest at . , this is the last time that a Tour de France stage exceeded . The shortest road stage was the tenth, from Geneva to Saint-Gervais, at . The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 16. It was among five \"hors catégorie\" (beyond category) rated climbs in the race.\n\nThe prologue at Futuroscope was won by Thierry Marie (), a specialist in the discipline, who had also taken the first yellow jersey in 1986. He recorded a time of 7:49 minutes, four seconds faster than LeMond and Raúl Alcalá () in second and third respectively. Fignon finished in 15th place, 19 seconds slower than Marie, with Delgado in 26th place losing a further five seconds.\n\nThe first and the second stage were run on the same day, the second stage in the team time trial format. After just of the first stage, Claudio Chiappucci () broke away from the field. He had won the mountain classifications at both Paris–Nice and the Giro d'Italia that year and aimed at getting the jersey early on in the Tour as well. He was joined in his breakaway by Steve Bauer (), Ronan Pensec (), and Frans Maassen (). With the team time trial looming in the afternoon, the field allowed the break to draw out an advantage. Additionally, a blockade by sheep farmers delayed the peloton, the main field, and caused several crashes, including one involving Delgado. Chiappucci took the points at the mountain sprints, ensuring that he would wear the polka-dot jersey for the next stage. from the finish, the lead was still at 13 minutes. As Maassen took the stage victory ahead of Pensec, the four-man group still retained an advantage of 10:35 minutes over the rest of the field. Bauer took the lead in the general classification, having posted the fastest time in the prologue. Later in the day the team time trial was won by the team. Seven seconds slower, finished in second place. Fignon's Castorama squad finished fifth, 33 seconds slower than Panasonic, but 20 seconds faster than LeMond's Z team, who were seventh. In between them were 7-Eleven with yellow-jersey wearer Bauer, who retained his overall lead.\n\nStage 3 began with an early attack by Stephen Roche, who was followed by LeMond. This prompted the teams of Bauer and Delgado to give chase, and the field was back together after . At , Fignon punctured a tyre, but he was able to rejoin shortly after. After the race was interrupted by another protest from sheep farmers, who had four fallen trees ready to block the road. The organisers received news of the blockade early and used a local youth on a motorcycle to lead the field through backstreets around the protest. The stage distance therefore increased by , with a total of of the race neutralised. With of the stage remaining, Roque de la Cruz () became the first rider to abandon the Tour, following a crash which also brought down Fignon, who again had to chase in order to regain contact with the main group. At this point, Moreno Argentin () had already attacked and was building an advantage on the rest of the field. He also crashed, but was able to remount and continued to win the stage by 2:29 minutes. In the peloton, Christophe Lavainne () won the sprint and raised in arms in celebration, unaware that Argentin had already finished. Through obtaining bonuses at intermediate sprints, Olaf Ludwig () took the lead in the points classification.\n\nStage 4 saw Gilles Delion () attack while Gerard Rué () was greeting his family in his home town. Delion was caught by Edwig Van Hooydonck (), but both were quickly brought back by the Panasonic team, who were working for Ludwig to win the stage. Next, Søren Lilholt () attacked and was later joined by Kurt Steinmann () and William Pulido (). The escapees enjoyed a maximum advantage of 45 seconds, but were caught with to go. later, the peloton passed through the narrow streets of Villechèrel, causing a crash and the field to split. Bugno, Delgado, and Fignon were caught out behind the incident. While Delgado and Bugno lost 21 seconds in the end, Fignon lost 44 seconds to his rivals in the general classification. At the finish, which for the first time was at Mont-Saint-Michel, Ludwig opened his sprint too early, allowing Johan Museeuw (), who won the stage, and Guido Bontempi () to pass him. Robert Millar was caught up in a crash, losing nine minutes, effectively ruling him out from competing in the general classification.\n\nStage 5, by far the longest at , was run in wet weather. As the peloton sped up to catch an early breakaway, Fignon drifted backwards and ultimately abandoned the Tour at the first feeding station. After the breakaway was cuaght, Gerrit Solleveld () attacked and stayed away, winning the stage 4:27 minutes ahead of Museeuw, who won the sprint of the field. Argentin, still bruised from his fall on stage 3 and another on stage 5, abandoned after the rest day.\n\nDuring stage 6, Chiappucci sustained two punctured tyres, both times at the start of the two ascents of the day. This meant that he was unable to defend his lead in the mountain classification, and the polka-dot jersey went to Dimitri Konyshev (), who became the first Soviet rider to wear a leader's jersey at the Tour de France. Bugno attacked shortly behind the feed zone, leading to a number of reactions from the field, but after , the peloton was back together. A small group, containing Museeuw and Viatcheslav Ekimov (), among others, lept away from the finish. Jelle Nijdam () accelerated from this group with to go and won the stage, ahead of Jesper Skibby () and Museeuw.\nStage 7's individual time trial was run in changing conditions. While the early starters competed in the dry, the later riders rode on wet roads. Miguel Induráin set an early fast time and held the lead for most of the day. Greg LeMond started fast, but faded later on to eventually finish fifth. Alcalá, also a late starter, was the fastest rider, 1:24 ahead of Induráin's time. Bugno was third, ahead of Delgado. Of the riders from the stage-1 breakaway, Pensec was fastest, in seventh place. He remained second overall however, 17 seconds behind Bauer, who finished the time trial in 14th place, one place ahead of Chiappucci. Stephen Roche lost 3 minutes in the last alone, suffering from hyperglycemia. Likewise, Charly Mottet lost significant time, finishing 3½ minutes behind Alcalá. Alcalá moved into fifth place overall, still more than seven minutes behind Bauer.\n\nEarly during stage 8, a four-man breakaway went ahead, but was quickly caught. The speed of the peloton saw Álvaro Pino (), winner of the 1986 Vuelta a España, abandon the race. Michel Vermote () then attacked after on a section of cobbled road. His maximum lead was over 11 minutes, but after about on his own, he was brought back by the main field. In the final , a group of 13 riders escaped, including Ludwig and Museeuw. Ludwig judged his sprint well this time and beat Museeuw for the win. It was the first stage victory by a rider from East Germany and from the Eastern Bloc in the Tour de France.\n\nStage 9 headed into Switzerland and was the last day that featured rain, before temperatures began to rise significantly. An escape group went clear after , which included Frans Maassen, who was still in fourth place overall. This prompted Bauer's team to chase, bringing the group back after . At the Côte des Rousses, the first second-category climb of the Tour, Massimo Ghirotto () and Eduardo Chozas () were out in front alone. On the same climb, Jean-François Bernard (), third in the 1987 Tour, fell behind and out of contention. The two escapees held on to their advantage into the finish town of Geneva, where Ghirotto edged out Chozas in the sprint.\n\nStage 10 was the first real test in the mountains, with a summit finish at the Saint Gervais-les-Baines ski resort on Mont Blanc. On the first climb of the day, the Col de la Colombière, Omar Hernández () attacked, followed by Thierry Claveyrolat (). As Hernández slowed, Claveyrolat overtook him and continued on alone, riding the rest of the stage on his own to take victory. He also took the lead in the mountains classification, which he would retain for the rest of the Tour. Behind him, Delgado attacked on the final climb with remaining, putting Bauer into difficulty. Pensec, who celebrated his 27th birthday, stayed with the other favourites and took over the yellow jersey. He led Chiappucci by 50 seconds, while Bauer fell back to third, 1:21 minutes adrift. Among the pre-race favourites, LeMond lost 19 seconds to Delgado, but finished with Bugno, Induráin, Alcalá, and Breukink. Bugno received a 20-second penalty for accepting food late in the stage, when it was no longer allowed.\n\nOn stage 11, the course ended with the final ascent to L'Alpe d'Huez, considered one of the most iconic climbs in cycling. Two mountains had to be crossed beforehand: the Col de la Madeleine and the Col du Glandon. Claveyrolat attacked again, early on during the ascent of the Madeleine, and gathered the mountain points at the summit. Mottet started to drop behind the group of favourites on the Madeleine, while Bernard retired. On the descent, Induráin got away but was overtaken by Claveyrolat on the climb of the Glandon. In between the climbs, at the feed zone, LeMond was involved in a crash, but able to carry on. On the Glandon, Delgado accelerated and only LeMond and Bugno were able to follow. Together they caught Induráin, who set the pace in the group through the ensuing valley and ensured that they reached Claveyrolat by the foot of the final climb. Shortly after the group began the ascent, Delgado attacked, with LeMond and Bugno following. As the pace slowed, Claveyrolat, Parra, and Breukink managed to catch back up. from the finish, Delgado lost contact with Bugno, who accelerated and took LeMond, Breukink, Claveyrolat, and Parra with him. It were Bugno and LeMond who were fastest along the finishing straight, with Bugno coming out on top to win the stage. Breukink finished third, one second behind LeMond in second place. Meanwhile, Millar paced Pensec up the climb, who finished 48 seconds behind Bugno and retained the race lead. Delgado lost forty seconds, while Induráin, exhausted by his work on the flat, lost 12 minutes on Alpe d'Huez, falling from contention. Chiappucci finished 1:48 minutes behind Bugno. This left Pensec first overall, 1:28 minutes ahead of Chiappucci, with LeMond up to third, but still 9:04 minutes behind his teammate. Alcalá had lost 5:41 minutes on Bugno, and therefore dropped to eighth place overall.\n\nPensec lost the yellow jersey the following day, at stage 12's mountain time trial to Villard-de-Lans. He finished almost three minutes slower than Chiappucci, who took the overall lead, now 1:17 minutes ahead of Pensec. The winner of the stage was Breukink, with Delgado in second place, thirty seconds slower. Delgado performed well despite problems with his rear wheel which forced him to change bikes within the last kilometre. Induráin produced another good performance, finishing third at 43 seconds. LeMond suffered during the second half of the climb and finished fifth, dropping to fourth in the general classification behind Breukink. Breukink was 6:55 minutes behind new leader Chiappucci, with LeMond a further 32 seconds adrift. In fifth place followed Delgado, now 9:02 minutes in arrears.\n\nStage 13 to Saint-Etienne took place on Bastille Day, the French national holiday. Phil Anderson () led down the descent from Villard-de-Lans, followed by Mottet, which prompted a reaction by the main field and both riders were brought back after . Several attempts to form lasting breakaways followed, but it took until the climb of the Côte d'Ardoix at for a 30-rider group to get away, including Pensec and Claveyrolat. Chiappucci, without the help of strong teammates, had to lead the chase himself, bringing back the breakaway from the finish. Just as the contact was made, a group of ten riders attacked, among them LeMond, Breukink, Induráin, and Andrew Hampsten (). At the foot of the last climb of the day, the Col de la Croix de Chaubouret, Delgado led a counter-attack with Bugno and Marino Lejarreta (). Although Induráin dropped back to aid Delgado's chase, the LeMond group maintained an advantage of thirty seconds until the finish. Here, Chozas won the sprint from Breukink and Hampsten. A group containing Alcalá, Roche, and Parra lost 3:09 minutes. Chiappucci came in with the peloton, losing 4:53 minutes. Pensec dropped from second to fourth in the general classification, arriving 7:47 minutes after Chozas. Chiappucci now led the race by 2:02 minutes over Breukink, with LeMond third at 2:34.\nDuring the early part of stage 14, Jean-Claude Colotti () was highly active. He joined an attack by teammate Claveyrolet at , before setting off on his own after a further unsuccessful attempt to form a breakaway. After , 17 more riders caught up to him. Jean-Claude Bagot () then attacked from the lead group with left to ride, but he was caught by the peloton on the final ascent to Causse Noir near Millau. Lejarreta accelerated from the group of favourites with to go, and was followed by Induráin and Bugno. At the finish, Lejarreta took victory, but did not raise his arms in celebration, thinking someone had finished ahead of him. 24 seconds later followed Induráin and Bugno. LeMond and Breukink finished together, another ten seconds behind. Chiappucci could only finish 13th, losing 13 seconds to LeMond and Breukink, whom he now led by 1:49 minutes in the general classification. Lejarreta moved up to seventh place overall.\n\nStage 15 was a transition stage, the last before the Pyrenees, and featured only smaller climbs. Adri van der Poel () launched an attack that resulted in an eleven-rider strong breakaway. This group was almost caught after of racing, but while three riders dropped back into the peloton, eight remained in front and were later joined by several others, who bridged across, including Roche, Mottet, Claveyrolet, and Chozas. The now 19-rider strong group increased their advantage to up to eight minutes, which would have moved Chozas up to fourth place overall. Therefore, the main field began to cut into their advantage, led by , , and . Eventually, Mottet attacked from the lead group and held on to the finish, winning the stage by 2:02 minutes ahead of Giuseppe Calcaterra (). When the peloton reached the finish, a split occurred in the field, which gained Chiappucci three seconds on his rivals in the general classification.\n\nIn very hot weather, stage 16 saw the last mountain-top finish of the Tour. In the second half of the stage, the summits of the Col d'Aspin, the Col du Tourmalet, and the final ascent to Luz Ardiden had to be climbed. On the early slopes of the Aspin, Chiappucci followed an attack by Jörg Müller () and found himself in a lead group, building an advantage on his rivals. At the summit, he led the group across 45 seconds ahead of the main field. As began to chase for LeMond on the approach to the Tourmalet, the gap began to decrease. In the front group, Miguel Ángel Martínez Torres () attacked and got away on his own. Behind, in the group of favourites, Breukink experienced a \"jour sans\", a day without energy, and began to fall behind. At the top of the Tourmalet, Chiappucci's lead over LeMond and Delgado was still 1:07 minutes, but in the valley before the final climb, he was caught with to go.\n\nOn the ascent to Luz Ardiden, Chiappucci defiantly set the pace at the front of the group. However, with left to race, an attack by Parra was too much and while LeMond, Induráin, and Lejarreta followed, Chiappucci fell behind. LeMond moved to the front and set a high pace as Parra was quickly dropped. They then caught the lone leader Martínez Torres with to go. Lejarreta was dropped shortly thereafter. For the duration of the climb LeMond worked at the front setting the pace to increase his time gains essentially winning the Tour on this attack. Induráin overtook him as they approached the summit and coming around the final turn he quickly turned his head around to verify LeMond was not going to challenge him for the stage win and began clapping his hands in celebration as he claimed the victory six seconds ahead of LeMond. Chiappucci eventually lost 2:19 minutes, which reduced his advantage over LeMond, who was now second overall, to just five seconds. Breukink lost 4:16 minutes, dropping to fourth behind Delgado, who finished 1:32 behind teammate Induráin.\n\nThe next day's route from Lourdes to Pau was considered easier than the day before, with the two major climbs, the \"hors categorie\" Col d'Aubisque and the first-category Col de Marie-Blanque both coming during the first half of the stage. Early on, a 19-man breakaway formed, including riders such as Bauer, Konyshev, Acácio da Silva (), Johan Bruyneel (), as well as LeMond's teammates Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and Atle Kvålsvoll. On the Aubisque, Óscar Vargas () attacked and reached the summit ahead of the lead group. On the Marie-Blanque, the situation had changed and Delgado's teammate Dominique Arnaud led solo over the top, 10:20 minutes ahead of the peloton. LeMond, already suffering with a saddle sore and swollen feet, got into even more trouble: isolated from his teammates, he punctured a tyre about from the summit. With the group of favourites, including yellow jersey Chiappucci, leaving him behind, LeMond had to wait 1:20 minutes for his team car to arrive. The new wheel given to him was rubbing on the frame, which meant that LeMond had to dismount again and change bikes. By now, he crossed the top of the Marie-Blanque 1:27 minutes behind Chiappucci. Teammates Eric Boyer and Jérôme Simon joined him, but had problems keeping up with LeMond during the descent, which he took flat out and without braking in order to catch back up. Duclos-Lassalle and Kvålsvoll were ordered by the team to stop and drop back from the lead group to aid LeMond in reaching Chiappucci after of chasing.\n\nUp ahead, Bruyneel attacked from the lead group and was followed by Konyshev, who got the better of the Belgian in the two-man sprint for the stage victory. It was the first time that a Soviet or Russian rider had won a stage of the Tour de France. LeMond accused Chiappucci of violating the unwritten rules of the sport, where traditionally a leader is not attacked if they have a crash or mechanical difficulties. Indeed, the team had even called back da Silva from the breakaway to assist Chiappucci in extending his advantage.\n\nStage 18 led the Tour to Bordeaux, a finishing town traditionally favouring the sprinters. The field started the day slowly and a real attack did not materialise until Anderson broke away after . He was soon joined by six other riders, but the break was caught later. With to go, a more serious move formed, with 19 riders, which included LeMond, Chiappucci, Breukink, Bugno, and Alcalá. At remaining, Breukink, Bugno, and the latter's teammate, Roberto Gusmeroli, attacked from the leading group. The other 16 riders fell behind and were soon caught by the main field. At the finish, Gusmeroli led out Bugno, who easily beat Breukink to become the first rider to win two stages at that year's Tour. Breukink meanwhile gained 18 seconds on Delgado and therefore moved into third place overall.\n\nThe next day, the peloton equally made a slow start to the stage, with the first real attack coming more than halfway into the race, after . Fifteen riders broke away from the field, including van der Poel, Pensec, Tony Rominger (), and Bontempi. After , the group had swollen to 24 riders. Bontempi, formerly a very good sprinter, but now considered past his prime, attacked from the breakaway and went solo to the finish, where he won the stage, 1:28 minutes ahead of Dag Otto Lauritzen (). During the stage, the Tour circumvented another blockade by sheep farmers, which only managed to hold up the press caravan, but did not influence the race.\n\nThe individual time trial on the penultimate day, stage 20, became decisive for the race's outcome. LeMond easily made up the five seconds needed to overcome Chiappucci at the top of the standings. He finished fifth on the day, 2:21 minutes ahead of Chiappucci, who was 17th. Erik Breukink claimed the stage victory, 28 seconds ahead of his teammate Alcalá, with Lejarreta in third, ahead of Induráin. Delgado was eighth fastest, 2:21 behind Breukink, and therefore unable to finish on the podium of the Tour for a fourth consecutive year. Through their strong performances, Alcalá and Induráin returned to the top-ten riders in the general classification.\n\nThe final stage to Paris was by tradition a ceremonial one, apart for the final section on the Champs-Élysées, when the stage victory is decided. Stephen Hodge tried to break away in Paris, in an attempt to make up the 16 seconds his team trailed in the team classification, but he was not successful. The stage came down to a sprint, won by Museeuw, ahead of Adriano Baffi () and Olaf Ludwig. It was the only time during that year's Tour that a stage finished in a mass sprint. LeMond crossed the finish line safely in the middle of the field, his arms aloft in celebration at his third overall Tour victory. 156 riders out of 198 starters reached the finish in Paris. In last place, the \"lanterne rouge\", was Rodolfo Massi (). Four teams managed to reach Paris with all nine riders: , , , and .\n\nLeMond had won the Tour without taking a stage win. Since the end of World War II, only Roger Walkowiak (1956), Gastone Nencini (1960), and Lucien Aimar (1966) had done so. He countered criticism that he had not shown enough fighting spirit by not taking an individual stage win, saying: \"If I had worried about individual stage victories, it's possible I would have lost the Tour de France.\" Particular praise was given after the Tour to Miguel Induráin, who some, such as his biographer Alasdair Fotheringham, speculated could have challenged for the overall victory had he not worked for Delgado, in particular on the stage to Alpe d'Huez, where he lost 12 minutes.\n\nThere were four main classifications in the 1990 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. Time bonuses were distributed to the first three finishers of each stage that was not a mountain stage or a time trial. The winner received a 20-second time bonus, with 12 seconds for second and eight seconds for third place respectively. These bonuses were reduced to 12, 8, and 4 seconds on stage 1, since two stages were held on the same day. In addition, time bonuses could be won at intermediate sprints during the first half of the race. The first three riders across the line were granted a bonus of 6, 4, and 2 seconds respectively.\n\nThe points classification was calculated in another way: the first cyclists to finish in a stage received points, based on their rank and the type of stage. Flat stages awarded the winner 35 points, down to one point for 25th place. On medium mountain stages, 25 points were given to the winner, down to one point for 20th place. On a mountainous stage, the first rider across the finish received 20 points, down to one point for 15th place. In time trials, 15 points were given to the winner, down to one point for tenth place. All stages, except time trials, also had one or more intermediate sprints, where some points could be won. All road stages included two intermediate sprints, except for stage 5 with eight sprints. The first three riders across the intermediate sprint line received 6, 4, and 2 points respectively. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. Olaf Ludwig won the classification with 256 points, 35 points ahead of Museeuw. The intermediate sprints classification, held until the year before, was abandoned for 1990.\n\nAdditionally, there was the mountains classification. The organisation ranked climbs by difficulty, with the hardest ascents rated \"hors catégorie\" and the easiest as fourth category. Points for this classification were won by the cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first. An \"hors catégorie\" climb gave the first rider across 40 points, down to one point for 15th place. First-category mountains awarded 30 points for the first rider, with second-, third-, and fourth-category giving out 20, 10, and 5 points respectively to the first across the summit. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots. Thierry Claveyrolat won the classification with 321 points, while Chiappucci placed second on 179 points.\n\nThere was also the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1966 were eligible. Until 1988, the leader of this classification had worn a white jersey, while in 1989, the leader was highlighted by wearing the logo of the European Union on his shoulder. Both were not used in the 1990 Tour. Gilles Delion won the classification, finishing in 15th place on the general classification.\n\nThe 1989 Tour had included the combination classification, which was also no longer run. Both the intermediate sprint as well as the combination classification were scrapped to allow for more prize money to be paid out to the other classifications, a move instigated by new race director Jean-Marie Leblanc, who had taken over the position in late 1988. The 1990 Tour was the first run completely under his control.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps. won the classification, just 16 seconds ahead of .\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered the most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Eduardo Chozas won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 16. This prize was won by Miguel Ángel Martínez Torres.\n\nThe Tour de France paid out F10,073,450 as prize money in total, two million of which went to the winner of the general classification (about $363,000 or £200,000 at the time). The prizes were mainly raised by the fees paid by departure and arrival cities along the course of the race. 550,000 francs had to be paid to host both the start and finish of a stage, with 300,000 francs asked for just one of the two. $75,000 each came from the entry fees paid by the teams to compete. Eventually, received the biggest share of prize money, £248,480, ahead of 's £115,830. Last in the list was , who gathered only £2,207. The overall budget of the Tour was around £10,000,000.\n\nNo rider tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during doping tests at the 1990 Tour. Eric Vanderaerden () was expelled from the race on stage 11 for repeatedly holding on to the doors of team cars during the ascent to Alpe d'Huez.\n"}

His mother was born in Baie Verte, Newfoundland to a moderately affluent family. Goudie was studying mechanical engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland as well as working as an auto mechanic part-time for his father's trucking company before \"Canadian Idol\". He received his first guitar for Christmas 1996 from his grandmother.\n\nGoudie's musical talents began in Sunday school, where he was encouraged by his grandmother Sophia to sing. By the time he turned sixteen, Goudie had formed a band with his friends, The Purple Monkey Bomb Squad, with a new rock/country focus. The band was moderately popular in Burlington, where they played in local bars after having received written permission to do so from his Grandmother. He was ousted from the band to make room for an older more \"experienced\" singer, Brandon Mitchell, when he was in grade 12. While frustrating, this inspired Rex to practice longer and harder, honing his skills that would eventually be used in Canadian Idol.\n\nAfter all votes had been cast on Canadian Idol, Goudie finished as runner-up to winner Melissa O'Neil. On April 6, 2006, she and Rex confirmed in an interview with the CTV entertainment program \"eTalk Daily\" that he and O'Neil had been dating since the third week of \"Canadian Idol\". They have since split up.\n\nAlthough he has been criticized by some of the judges for his stiffness while on stage, a sports collision injury had caused him limited motion in both knees. Goudie missed a knee specialist appointment, in August 2005, due to his progress on \"Canadian Idol\".\n\nIn September 2005, Goudie signed a major recording contract with Sony BMG. His debut CD \"Under the Lights\" was released on December 13, 2005, and debuted at No. 5 on the Canadian charts, selling 36,000 records in its first week. The album was certified gold in Canada 23 days after its release. In January 2006, \"Under the Lights\" was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.\n\nSongs that Rex performed on \"Canadian Idol\" include:\nOn August 29, 2006, Goudie made a special guest appearance on the Top 4 results show of \"Canadian Idol\" season 4. After performing his hit single \"Run\", host Ben Mulroney presented him with an award for his platinum album \"Under the Lights\".\n\nHis official biography \"Idolized\", written by St. John's author Kim Kielley, was released in September 2006.\n\nHis second album, entitled \"Look Closer\" was released on December 12, 2006. The album made its debut at No. 19 on the Canadian charts, and sold over 11,000 copies in its first week. However, two weeks after its release, it fell off the top 100 chart.\n\nIn September 2006, Goudie, along with fellow Burlington native Shaun Majumder, started a foundation in their hometown to help raise money for medical needs. The Share Foundation has held several concerts, served with merchandise, and have raised over $50,000 Canadian dollars. The following month, Goudie appeared at the opening ceremonies of the 17th annual Provincial Student Leadership Conference of Newfoundland and Labrador, hosted by Laval High School, where he spoke about the importance of perseverance and getting involved in one's school.\n\nIn January 2007, it was revealed that Goudie would be travelling to the United States aboard a cruise ship, performing for the fans that decided to take a trip 'down south' with him. For a week, Goudie performed hits from his new album as well older hits from his platinum album \"Under The Lights\".\n\nIn March 2007, he won a Canadian Radio Music Award for Best New Solo Artist (CHR) of the Year.\n\nOn Sunday, November 25, 2007, Goudie announced on his MySpace account the news that SONY BMG had indeed dropped him. He stated:\n\nAfter announcing this, Goudie quickly added that he is in Nashville working on songs for his new album.

White, 264 U.S. 443 (1924), was a Supreme Court case. In line with the plain meaning rule, the Court determined that a native-born citizen of the United States was not automatically entitled to rights granted by a statute for naturalized citizens, despite the doctrine of absurdity.\n\nThe proviso of § 22 of the Immigration Act of 1917 allowed for the wife of a \"naturalized\" citizen (who married his wife after the naturalization) to be brought over to the United States. It was argued that Chung Fook, a native-born citizen, would then be allowed to bring over his wife, as it would not make sense to gave a particular right to a naturalized citizen that a native-born citizen was not permitted. The Court rejected this argument and wrote \"The words of the statute being clear, if it unjustly discriminates against the native-born citizen, or is cruel and inhuman in its results, as forcefully contended, the remedy lies with Congress, and not with the courts. Their duty is simply to enforce the law as it is written, unless clearly unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe Court opinion was delivered by Justice Sutherland.\n\n\"Chung Fook is a native-born citizen of the United States. Lee Shee, his wife, is an alien Chinese woman, ineligible for naturalization. In 1922, she sought admission to the United States, but was refused and detained at the immigration station on the ground that she was an alien, afflicted with a dangerous contagious disease. No question is raised as to her alienage or the effect and character of her disease, but the contention is that, nevertheless, she is entitled to admission under the proviso found in § 22 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 891, c. 29.\"\n\n"}

A Dutch independent label, Foundation 2000, signed them for one album. Before recording \"Mindloss\" they first released another demo in 1990, which also received positive feedback. As a supporting act for Carcass they travelled through Belgium and the Netherlands impressing the metal-scene also on stage. Colin Richardson was the producer of 1991's album \"Mindloss\".\n\nBefore they toured with Revenant from New Jersey, guitarist Alex van Schaik was replaced by Boudewijn Bonebakker. Not satisfied with Foundation 2000, Gorefest signed a contract in 1992 with Nuclear Blast. Hoogendoorn quit because of incidents during the Mindloss-tour and drummer Ed Warby (who came from melodic band called Elegy) took his place just two weeks before recording sessions of \"False\" which was also produced by Colin Richardson. The album sold relatively well in the Netherlands and Germany for a band of the genre.\nIn the months to come they completed a European tour with Deicide and Atrocity, playing in Germany, Sweden, Spain, Czech Republic, Slovakia and England. In 1993, Gorefest played a show at the Dynamo Open Air at Eindhoven. \"The Eindhoven Insanity\" was released soon thereafter, featuring this performance. Also in 1993, they toured North America as a supporting act for metal band Death. Their \"Insanity Tour\" closed with a show in Mexico City, Mexico.\n\n\"Erase\" was recorded in 1994, with producer Pete Coleman and revealed a more mature Gorefest with a different attitude towards traditional death metal. As a result, public opinion towards Gorefest was divided. \"Erase\", however, proved to be a success as international sales went well through 1994 and 1995. The band reached a broader set of countries in the following tours.\n\nIn the \"Fear\" EP and \"Freedom\" single, Gorefest revealed new tracks showing that they wanted to drastically expand upon the musical changes they had applied in \"Erase\" (De Koeijer declared in some interviews that he even had thoughts about taking singing lessons). This would be confirmed in 1996 with a rockish \"Soul Survivor\" – a total departure from their roots even showing traces of pop – and a very similar \"Chapter 13\" in 1998.\n\nThey even abandoned their heavy image and the graphics for these works were less extreme. Inexorably, fans turned their backs on them and the sales of the album were a relative fiasco, thus they split up in 1998.\n\nGorefest reformed in 2004 and played various summer festivals in 2005. The band then came out with a new album, \"La Muerte\". They produced the album themselves, with mixing by Tue Madsen from Antfarm Studios.\n\nIn 2006, De Koeyer appeared at EPICA's concert in Paradiso (Amsterdam) as a guest grunter on the song \"Consign to Oblivion\".\n\nThe next album, \"Rise to Ruin\" was released in August 2007. The American release was licensed to Candlelight Records.\n\nOn 15 June 2009 the band announced that they were calling it quits again, stating that they felt they had gone as far with the band as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A globster is distinguished from a normal beached carcass by being hard to identify, at least by initial untrained observers, and by creating controversy as to its identity.\n\nThe term \"globster\" was coined by Ivan T. Sanderson in 1962 to describe the Tasmanian carcass of 1960, which was said to have \"no visible eyes, no defined head, and no apparent bone structure.\" Other sources simply use the term \"blob\".\n\nMany globsters have initially been described as gigantic octopuses, though they later turned out to be decayed carcasses of whales or large sharks. As with the \"Chilean Blob\" of 2003, many are masses of whale blubber released from decaying whale corpses. Others initially thought to be dead plesiosaurs later turned out to be the decayed carcasses of basking sharks. Others remain unexplained. Giant and colossal squid may also explain some globsters, particularly those tentatively identified as monster octopuses.\n\nSome globsters were examined only after they had decomposed too much and seemed to represent evidence of a new species, or were destroyed—as happened with the \"\"Cadborosaurus willsi\"\" carcass, found in 1937. However, Canadian scientists did analyse the DNA of the Newfoundland Blob—which revealed that the tissue was from a sperm whale. In their resulting paper, the authors point out a number of superficial similarities between the Newfoundland Blob and other globsters, concluding a similar origin for those globsters is likely. Analyses of other globsters have yielded similar results.\n\nThe following is a chronological list of carcasses that have been described as globsters or blobs in the literature.\n\n"}

Together with Pseudo-Zoroaster and Pseudo-Hystaspes, Ostanes belongs to the group of pseudepigraphical \"Hellenistic Magians\", that is, a long line of Greek and other Hellenistic writers who wrote \"under the name of\" famous \"Magians\". While Pseudo-Zoroaster was identified as the \"inventor\" of astrology, and Pseudo-Hystaspes was stereotyped as an apocalyptic prophet, Ostanes was imagined to be a master sorcerer.\n\nUnlike \"Zoroaster\" and \"Hystaspes\", which have well attested Iranian language counterparts, for \"Ostanes\" there is \"no evidence of a figure of a similar name in Iranian tradition.\" In the \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" entry for Ostanes, Morton Smith cites Justi's \"Namensbuch\" for instances of the name which refer to real persons. Smith: \"Which [of these references to] Ostanes (...), if any, gave rise to the legend of the magus is uncertain.\"\n\nSmith goes on to reconstruct the Old Iranian name as *(H)uštāna. The Justi entries that Smith alludes to are: Diodorus 17.5.5 and Plutarch \"Artax.\" 1.1.5 (cit. Ktesias) for Ὀστάνης as the name of one of the sons of Darius Nothos, and a mention in Arrian (\"An.\" 4.22) of a certain Αὐστάνης of Paraetakene, north-east of Bactria, who was captured by Alexander's general Krateros and then taken to India. Arrian's Αὐστάνης is Haustanes in Curtius 8.5. Ktesias names 'Άρτόστης' as the son of Darius Nothus, and Justi suggests that Plutarch confused Artostes as Ostanes.\n\nThe origins of the figure of \"Ostanes\", or rather, who the Greeks imagined him to be, lies within the framework of \"alien wisdom\" that the Greeks (and later Romans) ascribed to famous foreigners, many of whom were famous to the Greeks even before being co-opted as authors of arcana. One of these names was that of (pseudo-)Zoroaster, whom the Greeks perceived to be the founder of the magi and of their \"magi\"cal arts. Another name was that of (pseudo-) Hystaspes, Zoroaster's patron. The third of \"les Mages hellénisés\" was Ostanes, imaginatively described by the 4th century BCE Hermodorus (apud Diogenes Laërtius \"Prooemium\" 2) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster.\n\nOnce the magi had been associated with \"magic\"—Greek \"magikos\"—it was but a natural progression that the Greek's image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too. The 1st century CE Pliny the Elder names \"Zoroaster\" as the inventor of magic (\"Natural History\" .2.3), but a \"principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.\" Thus, while \"universal consensus\"—so the skeptical Pliny—was that magic began with (pseudo-)Zoroaster (xxx.2.3), as far as Pliny says he could determine, \"Ostanes\" was the first extant writer of it (xxx.2.8).\n\nThis 'Ostanes', so Pliny states, was a Persian magus who had accompanied Xerxes in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced \"magicis\", the \"most fraudulent of the arts\", to that country. But the figure of Ostanes was such that Pliny felt \"it necessary to supplement his history with doppelgangers\"; so, not only does Ostanes appear as a contemporary of the early 5th century BCE Xerxes, but he is also contemporary with—and companion of—the late 4th century BCE Alexander. Pliny goes on to note that Ostanes's introduction of the \"monstrous craft\" to the Greeks gave those people not only a \"lust\" (\"aviditatem\") for magic, but a downright \"madness\" (\"rabiem\") for it, and many of their philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it.(xxx.2.8-10).\n\nPliny also transmits Ostanes's definition of magic: \"As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it; he professes to divine (\"divina promittit\") from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins and axes, and by many other methods, and besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld\" (xxx.2.8-10). By the end of the 1st century CE, \"Ostanes\" is cited as an authority on alchemy, necromancy, divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones. Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century \"he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy\" and \"much medieval alchemical material circulated under his name.\"\n\nThis \"authority\" continued in Arabic and Persian alchemical literature, such as an Arabic treatise titled \"Kitab al-Fusul al-ithnay ‘ashar fi 'ilm al-hajar al-mukarram\" (\"The Book of the Twelve Chapters on the Honourable Stone\").\n\n"}

He was the natural son of Agostino Carracci.\n\nCarracci was born in the parish of Sta Lucia in Venice, probably in 1583, the product of an affair with a courtesan called Isabella, occurring on his father first visit to Venice. Giovanni Battista Agucchi, a friend and protégé of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese tells us in a 1609 letter, raised along with Sisto Badalocchio and a near contemporary to Domenichino and Lanfranco. He first apprenticed with his father. The main Baroque artist biographers of his time, Baglione, Bellori and Malvasia, make some note of him.\n\nHe first apprenticed with his father. Malvasia recalls his father admired a ‘’Madonna and Child’’ that completed at the age of seventeen. Annibale’s 1590s portrait of a boy resembles those in Malvasia’s woodcut with 1678 ‘’’Felsina Pittrice’’’. He may also be the boy in the Brera portrait group, including Annibale’s father Mastro Antonio.\n\nWhen his father died in 1602, Antonio moved to Rome to work under his uncle Annibale to whom he developed a deep affection. He likely worked on the frescoes of the Galleria Farnese, on the lunettes for the Palazzo Aldobrandini chapel, and probably in the Herrera Chapel. After his uncle’s passing he received commissions in Rome from Cardinal Tonti and Cardinal Peretti-Montalto, including the ‘’Stanza del Diluvio’’ in the Quirinal Palace, and major altarpieces like Berlin ‘’Madonna and Child with Saints and Galleria Corsini ‘’Nativity’’. \n\nThe self-assurance of the letters he wrote to Cardinal Farnese and his father’s old protector, Cardinal Spinola, after his uncle’s death suggest they were written by Agucchi, who in his slightly later (September 12, 1609) letter to Dulcini all about Antonio, speaks of a career that is already well begun. Malvasia misquotes this letter and copies it as ‘[Antonio’s work] seems that of a beginner’ the MS actually says the opposite ‘il suo fare non pare da principiante’. It is no surprise to see that Antonio speaks of the impegni that he already has, to read that he has learned enough ‘tanto da tirarmi avanti da me stesso’, and that he sees himself as maintaining the Carracci school in Bologna, and turning the studio to service to the Farnese ‘in essa scuola, procurerò che s’avanzino in essa per dovere indirizzare l’opera l’oro al servizio di V.S. Ill.ma...’\n\nAntonio inherited the studio against the claims of Annibale’s surviving brother Giovanni Antonio, who contested the inheritance by throwing doubt on his nephew’s paternity. Despite gaining commissions, those from the Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, the main patron after the Farnese, declined once the cardinal's uncle Clement VIII died in 1605. This also coincides with the onset of Annibale’s incapacitating illness. The ascent of the Borghese Pope, Paul V, continued the decline of the studio. By report, Annibale could not receive Cardinal Scipione Borghese, slipping out of a back door when he came to the studio; but Antonio was introduced to the pope's Prodatario, Cardinal Tonti, also an avid collector. Tonti employed Antonio to paint four chapels in his church; other public commissions included a chapel in Santa Maria in Monticelli, work in Sant' Girolamo dei Schiavoni, Santa Maria in Trastevere, and Sant' Sebastiano fuori le Mura, and in Palazzo Mattei. Antonio and Guido Reni collaborated in the decoration of the \"Cappella dell’ Annunciata\" in the Palazzo Quirinal, painting a frieze of the \"Stanza del Diluvio\". He contributed, around 1616, to the Alexander frescoes done for Cardinal Peretti Montalto; other works were done for Marchese Giustiniani, Cardinal Orsino, the Ludovisi, Cavalier Sachetti, Dionigio Buonavia in Bologna; and of course he was under the protection of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who recognized him as his ‘pittor di casa’ and paid him a monthly stipend.\n\nAntonio was well known for doing cabinet-size compositions often based on the great variety of graphic material in possession of the Carracci studio. His masterpiece, \"The Deluge\" was one of Cardinal Mazarin’s most prized pictures, and influential for Poussin’s early Battle paintings as well as his paintings of the \"Seasons\" for Louis XIV 40 years later. With his Reni-like refinement, articulation of narrative, space, gesture and expression, the \"Deluge\" was an important academic collaboration with Agucchi. \n\nAntonio was greatly admired by contemporaries, such that made his early death a particularly tragic loss \"nel morire che seguì nel 1618 mostrò tal contritione e sentimento che simil passaggi si vedono in pochi\". Recently, his reputation has declined, and he has been described as a small-scale and awkward mimic of his elder's works. His friend Giulio Mancini said he not only inherited Annibale’s studio, but also \"Herede dei suoi disegni et arte fù Antonio...\". Antonio, being as Guido put it, the ‘ultima scintilla (del) valor Caraccesco’ had in fact more invested in the Carracci studio than anyone else. \n\nThe original of the much copied composition of the \"Martyrdom of St Denis\" (‘St Denis effrayant ses bourreaux’) is evidently by Antonio, and the companion subject to his \"St Paul baptizing St Denis\". \n\nIt was not an idle encomium on Mancini’s part when he spoke that Antonio ‘mostrò gran segni di dover venir grande’. All the same, it was easy for his identity to be subsumed to that of elder Carracci. Because he shared the same initials as his father and uncle, and because the Carracci often collaborated, paintings by them were often confused. When Padre Resta gave the drawing of the Deluge, which he had had from Bellori, to Max Emmanuel of Bavaria, he was pleased to hear that the Elector treasured the gift and kept it on a table at his bedside; but ‘lo teneva per pittura d’Annibale’. \n\n\n\n"}

They chose the Light Armored Vehicle design from GM Defense. It entered service with the Marines in 1983. The U.S. Army was interested in these vehicles at the time, but did not order any—although they did later with the introduction of the Stryker family of vehicles. The Army did, however, borrow at least a dozen LAV-25s for use by the 82nd Airborne Division, 3-73rd Armor for a Scout Platoon during the Gulf War. These LAV-25s were later returned to the Marine Corps after the conflict. The USMC ordered 758 vehicles of all variants. LAVs first saw combat during the Invasion of Panama in 1989, and continued service in the Gulf War, Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan.\n\nThe table of organization and equipment for an USMC light-armored reconnaissance battalion includes 56 LAV-25s, 16 LAV-ATs, 12 LAV-Ls, 8 LAV-Ms, 4 LAV-Rs, 4 LAV-C2s, and an unknown number of LAV-MEWSS vehicles.\n\nThe LAV platform is planned to remain in service with the Marine Corps until 2035. The Marines aim to have prototypes for the LAV's replacement, dubbed the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV), by 2023. The ARV is planned to be a networked family of wheeled vehicles capable of performing various mission sets, with 500 to be procured.\n\nPowered by a 6V53T Detroit Diesel turbo-charged engine, they are four-wheel drive (rear wheels) transferable to Eight-wheel drive. These vehicles are also amphibious, meaning they have the ability to \"swim\", but are limited to non-surf bodies of water (no oceans). While engaged in amphibious operations, the maximum speed is approximately using equipped propellers. The current Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) modifications will hinder or eliminate amphibious ops.\n\nTypical land speeds are approximately 100 km/h (62.5 mph) in either 4- or 8-wheel drive; however, fuel economy decreases in 8-wheel drive. The vehicles operate on diesel fuel. They are equipped with a M242 Bushmaster 25 mm autocannon, two M240 7.62 mm machine guns, and two 4-barrel smoke grenade launchers located on the forward left and right sides of the turret. The crew is three; vehicle commander (VC), gunner, and driver; and four passengers (scouts) with combat gear.\n\nThe LAV-25 is a lightly armored vehicle. The base model is protected by light gauge high hardness steel armor (MIL-A-46100), varying in nominal thickness from 4.71 mm to 9.71 mm. This level of high-hardness steel armor is intended only to offer protection against small arms rounds such as the common 7.62x39mm M1943 ball used by the AKM, to achieve the lowest possible weight and cost.\n\nStandard LAV fitted with a turret with 360° traverse, armed with an M242 25 mm chain gun with 420 rounds of 25 mm ammunition, both M791 APDS-T (Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot-Tracer) and M792 HEI-T (High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer), of which half is ready for use. One hundred fifty rounds are ready for use from one stowage bin, 60 from another stowage bin, the other 210 rounds are stowed elsewhere in the vehicle. A coaxial M240C machine gun is mounted alongside the M242, and a pintle-mounted M240B/G machine gun, with 1,320 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition, is mounted on the turret roof. The Canadian Army uses an upgraded version of this chassis for its Coyote Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle has been through many changes through the late 1990s. The new modification or SLEP has changed the LAV-25 to the \"LAV-25A1\" standard and has been completely fielded.\n\nFunding has been approved for continued upgrades to the LAV family to bring them up to the LAV-A2 standard. Phase I improvements include increased external and internal ballistic armor upgrades, improved fire suppression equipment, and upgrading the vehicle's suspension to the Generation II standard. Phase II upgrades include replacing the turret hydraulics with an electric drive system and replacing the thermal sight with an improved model incorporating a laser range finder for aircraft.\n\nTo reflect the improved significant survivability and capability enhancements occurring today, the LAV is being renamed as the LAV-A2. The LAV-A2 project involved developing and installing an internal and external ballistic protection upgrade package, developed by Armatec Survivability, for the Light Armored Vehicles, an automatic fire suppression system for the interior of the vehicle and a Generation II suspension upgrade to support the added weight of the new armor. The suspension upgrade includes new struts/steering knuckles, torsion bars, shocks and mounts and driveshaft. The three-kit armor system provides the LAV with additional survivability against improvised explosive devices (IED) and direct-fire kinetic energy weapons.\n\nThe LAV-25A2 includes the Improved Thermal Sight System (ITSS) developed by Raytheon, scheduled for fielding by the end of 2007. The ITSS provides the gunner and commander with thermal images, an eye-safe laser range finder, a fire-control solution and far-target location target grid information.\n\nThe new armor will provide protection from 14.5 mm armor-piercing rounds, and include an anti-spall lining on the inside to further protect crew members. It will be similar to the protection found on the U.S. Army's LAV III \"Stryker\" variant.\n\nTests by the U.S. Army's Operational Test Command (OTC), Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate at Fort Bragg demonstrated that the LAV-25A2 could be airdropped from transport aircraft, a capability of interest to Army airborne units. On 26 October 2018, Alpha Company, 4th Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division was activated equipped with ex-USMC LAV-25A2s.\n\nIn January 2019, General Dynamics was awarded a $37.2 million contract to upgrade the Marine Corps' LAV fleet. Designated the LAV A3, upgrades include improvements to the powerpack to improve reliability, cooling capacity, diagnostics, and fuel economy, a new drivetrain for improved towing capability, a steering dampener to improve road feel and usability, and a digitized drivers' instrument panel. The initial contract was for 60 hardware kits which are planned for installation by 2021.\n\n\nAn unknown variant is used by at least one civilian law enforcement agency.\n\n\n"}

The battle was the final encounter between the two emperors. After his navy's defeat in the Battle of the Hellespont, Licinius withdrew his forces from the city of Byzantium across the Bosphorus to Chalcedon in Bithynia. Constantine followed, and won the subsequent battle. This left Constantine as the sole emperor, ending the period of the Tetrarchy.\n\nThe navy of Licinius had suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of the Hellespont. His admiral, Abantus, had been outfought by Constantine's son, the caesar Crispus, despite the latter's distinctly smaller fleet. Following this naval victory, Constantine crossed over to Asia Minor. He used a flotilla of light transports he had ordered to be built on the Bosphorus in order to avoid the enemy army, which, under the command of Licinius' newly appointed co-emperor Martinian, was guarding the coast at Lampsacus on the Hellespont.\n\nFollowing the destruction of his naval forces Licinius evacuated the garrison of Byzantium, which joined his main army in Chalcedon on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. From there he also summoned Martinian's forces and a band of Visigothic auxiliaries, under their leader Aliquaca (or Alica), to reinforce his principal army which had been depleted by its earlier defeat at the Battle of Adrianople. It is not clear whether Martinian's forces reached Licinius before September 18 when Licinius was brought to battle by Constantine.\n\nConstantine's army landed on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus at a place called the Sacred Promontory and marched southward towards Chalcedon. Licinius moved his army a few miles north towards Chrysopolis. Constantine's army reached the environs of Chrysopolis before the forces of Licinius. Following a retreat to his tent to seek divine guidance, Constantine decided to take the initiative. \n\nThe religious aspect of the conflict was reflected in Licinius drawing up his battle lines with images of the pagan gods of Rome prominently displayed, whilst Constantine's army fought under his talismanic Christian standard, the labarum. Licinius had developed a superstitious dread of the labarum and forbade his troops from attacking it, or even looking directly at it.\n\nConstantine seemingly eschewed any subtlety of manoeuvre, he launched a single massive frontal assault on Licinius' troops and routed them. He won a decisive victory in what was a very large-scale battle. According to the historian Zosimus, \"There was great slaughter at Chrysopolis.\" Licinius was reported to have lost 25,000 to 30,000 dead, with thousands more breaking and running in flight. Licinius managed to escape and gathered around 30,000 of his surviving troops at the city of Nicomedia.\n\nRecognising that his surviving forces in Nicomedia could not stand against Constantine's victorious army, Licinius was persuaded to throw himself on the mercy of his enemy. Constantia, Constantine's half-sister and Licinius' wife, acted as intermediary. Initially, yielding to the pleas of his sister, Constantine spared the life of his brother-in-law, but some months later he ordered his execution, thereby breaking his solemn oath. Licinius was suspected of treasonable actions and the army command pressed for his execution.\n\nA year later, Constantine's nephew the younger Licinius also fell victim to the emperor's anger or suspicions. In defeating his last foe, Licinius, Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman empire; the first such since the elevation of Maximian to the status of augustus by Diocletian in April 286. After his conquest of the eastern portion of the Roman Empire Constantine made the momentous decision to give the east its own capital, and the empire as a whole its second. He chose the city of Byzantium — renamed \"Constantinopolis\" — as the site of this new foundation.\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\nSecondary sources\n"}

He was the son of a schoolmaster in Delft, where he learned painting from Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt, a prominent portrait painter in the Netherlands. Late in 1640 he moved to London to join Anthony van Dyck's studio as a pupil and assistant, but had little time to learn from Van Dyck himself as the latter fell ill and died in 1641. Beck possessed the freedom of hand and readiness, or rather rapidity of execution, for which Van Dyck was so remarkable, in so much that when Charles I observed the expeditious manner of Beck's painting, he exclaimed, \"Faith! Beck, I believe you could paint riding post\" and asked him to teach his sons drawing.\n\nHe taught drawing to Charles II of England and his brothers James II of England, and Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester. After the outbreak of the English Civil War that eventually led to the execution of his patron Charles I, Beck left England to travel around the courts of Europe.

While sick in Germany he was thought dead and prepared for burial, but he revived and was gradually restored to life.

He asked leave from her company to visit his friends and family in the Netherlands, which according to Houbraken was against her wishes.

The total race distance was 22 stages over . The race was won by Miguel Indurain, whose Banesto team also won the team classification. The points classification was won by Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, although he almost crashed out in the final stage. The mountains classification was won by Claudio Chiappucci, and the young rider classification by Álvaro Mejía.\n\nThe 1991 Tour had a starting field of 22 teams of 9 cyclists. Sixteen teams qualified by being ranked in the top 16 of the FICP ranking for teams in May 1991: After the 1991 Giro d'Italia and the Dauphiné Libéré, the Tour organiser gave six additional wildcards.\n\nOf the 198 cyclists starting the race, 38 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The average age of riders in the race was 28.30 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Dimitri Zhdanov () to the 36-year-old Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\n\nGreg LeMond, the winner of the last two editions, was still considered a favourite going into the race, although not by the French media, as his early season had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 13.\n\nThe prologue was won by specialist Thierry Marie, who also had won the prologue in the previous race. LeMond finished with the third-best time. In the first stage, a group of eleven cyclists escaped, including some cyclists aiming for the overall win: LeMond, Breukink, Rolf Sørensen and Kelly. Marie was not in this group, and thanks to time bonuses LeMond became the race leader. Later that day, the team time trial (stage 2) was run, won by Sørensen's team, and Sørensen became the new leader of the general classification.\n\nSørensen kept the lead for a few stages, but in the fifth stage he fell (crashing into a traffic island) and broke his clavicle. He managed to finish the stage, but was unable to start the next stage, so the sixth stage started without a yellow jersey. In that sixth stage, Thierry Marie escaped early in the stage, and reached the finish alone, with a solo of , the third-longest post-war solo escape in the Tour de France. His margin to the rest was big enough to put him back in the top position of the general classification. The time trial in stage eight was won by Miguel Indurain, with LeMond in second place, only eight seconds slower. This was enough to make LeMond the new leader, with Breukink in second place. Stage 9 saw the first Brazilian, Mauro Ribeiro, to win a stage at the Tour de France.\n\nBefore the tenth stage, two cyclists from PDM gave up. During that stage, two more gave up, and one came in late. The team revealed that the remaining four cyclists (including Breukink, Kelly and Alcala, ranked in the top ten of the general classification) were also sick, and the next morning the entire team abandoned. There were rumours that a doping program had gone wrong, but no official penalties were given. After the eleventh stage, there was a rest day, on which the cyclists were transferred from Nantes to Pau, by airplane. Urs Zimmermann had a fear of flying, so he refused to use the airplane. The jury then disqualified him, but after the other cyclists protested, he was allowed to use other means of transportation.\nThe Tour entered the Pyrenees in the twelfth stage. A group escaped with some strong outsiders: Luc Leblanc, Charly Mottet and Pascal Richard. LeMond was unable to organise the chase, so the group stayed away until the finish. Mottet won the stage, and Leblanc became the new leader in the general classification, with LeMond now in second place.\n\nThe thirteenth stage included even more climbs than the twelfth stage. LeMond escaped on the bottom of the Tourmalet, but Indurain chased him and reached him, taking other cyclists with him. Near the top of the Tourmalet, LeMond was unable to follow, and lost contact with the others. After the top, LeMond was able to get back on the descent, but in the meantime Indurain had escaped. LeMond tried to get back to Indurain, but was unable to do so. When they reached the start of the climb of the Col d'Aspin, LeMond was within sight of Indurain, but on the climb Indurain increased the distance.\n\nClaudio Chiappucci had escaped from the chasing group, and was getting close to Indurain. When Indurain heard this, he waited for Chiappucci; they then worked together to get away from LeMond. Chiappucci and Indurain stayed away until the finish; Chiappucci won the stage and Indurain became the new leader. LeMond finished that stage in ninth place, losing more than seven minutes.\n\nThe next three stages were relatively flat, and normally no important changes in the general classification are expected. But LeMond did everything he could to win back time, and escaped on the sixteenth stage; finishing in second place, he won back almost half a minute.\n\nThe seventeenth stage was in the Alps, with an uphill finish on l'Alpe d'Huez. Gianni Bugno won, closely followed by Indurain. LeMond lost two more minutes this stage.\nThe eighteenth stage was the last mountainous stage, and in this stage LeMond lost almost seven minutes. Indurain was leading the race, three minutes before Gianni Bugno. Because a time trial, Indurain's specialty, was the last serious obstacle in the race, Indurain was almost sure of the victory. And indeed, Indurain won that time trial, so he won the Tour de France of 1991.\n\nIn the last stage, there was a crash on the Champs-Elysées, just before the finish, after Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, sprinting for the stage victory, hit a barrier. Abdoujaparov was leading the points classification, but had to finish the stage to win this classification. After fifteen minutes, he was able to get up and walk his bicycle across the finish line.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1991 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey in 1991. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The leaders of the team classification had previously worn yellow caps, but this was abandoned after the 1990 Tour.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Claudio Chiappucci won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 13. This prize was won by Chiappucci.\n\n"}
{"id": "2281222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281222", "title": "Clogging", "text": "Clogging\n\nClogging is a type of folk dance in which the dancer's footwear is used percussively by striking the heel, the toe, or both against a floor or each other to create audible rhythms, usually to the downbeat with the heel keeping the rhythm. The dance style has recently fused with others including African-American rhythms, and the Peruvian dance \"zapateo\" (which may in itself be derived from early European clog dances), resulting in the birth of newer street dances, such as tap, locking, jump, hakken, stomping, Gangsta Walking, and the Candy Walk dance. The use of wooden-soled clogs is rarer in the more modern dances since clog shoes are not commonly worn in urban society, and other types of footwear have replaced them in their evolved dance forms. Clogging is often considered the first form of street dance because it evolved in urban environments during the industrial revolution.\n\nIn later periods it was not always called \"clogging\", being known variously as foot-stomping, buck dancing, clog dancing, jigging, or other local terms. What all these had in common was emphasizing the downbeat of the music by enthusiastic footwork. As for the shoes, many old clogging shoes had no taps and some were made of leather and velvet, while the soles of the shoes were either wooden or hard leather.\n\nClogging can be divided into five major categories: 1) shuffle clogging, 2) cadence clogging, 3) rhythm clogging, 4) stomp clogging, and 5) buck-dancing. \n\nThe shuffle clogging style is said to be the most popular style for bluegrass music cloggers while rhythm and stomp clogging are more popular with old-time music cloggers. What sets clogging apart from other dance styles such as tap-dancing is the lack of upper body movement used during performance like Irish Sean-nós dance which had significant influence on the origins of the dance. While tap dancers place emphasis on stage presence and arm movements, cloggers limit their upper body movement, focusing primarily on their feet.\n\nClogging is the official state dance of Kentucky and North Carolina and was the social dance in the Appalachian Mountains as early as the 18th century.\n\nIn the United States, team clogging originated from square dance teams in Asheville, North Carolina's Mountain Dance and Folk Festival (1928), organized by Bascom Lamar Lunsford in the Appalachian region.\n\nAmerican Clogging is associated with the predecessor to bluegrass—\"old-time\" music, which is based on English, and Irish fiddle tunes as well as African banjo tunes. Clogging primarily developed from Irish step dancing called Sean-nós dance; there was also some English, Scottish, German, and Cherokee step dances, as well as African rhythms and movement influences too. It was from clogging that tap dance eventually evolved. Now, many clogging teams compete against other teams for prizes such as money and trophies.\n\nThe term \"buck,\" as in buck dancing, is traceable to the West Indies and is derived from a Tupi Indian word denoting a frame for drying and smoking meat; the original 'po bockarau' or buccaneers were sailors who smoked meat and fish after the manner of the Indians. Another source states that the word \"bockorau\" can be traced to the \"Angolan\" word \"buckra', and was used to refer to white people, which is disputed. Eventually the term came to describe Irish immigrant sailors whose jig dance was known as 'the buck.'\" Another origin of the term \"buck dance\" comes from the idea that this style of dance was a flirtation. The male dancer would show off his skills on the dance floor to attract the female, thus being compared to the buck's courting ritual of the doe.\n\nOne source states that buck dancing was the earliest combination of the basic shuffle and tap steps performed to syncopated rhythms in which accents are placed not on the straight beat, as with the jigs, clogs, and other dances of European origin, but on the downbeat or offbeat, a style derived primarily from the rhythms of African tribal music.\n\nBuck dancing was popularised in America by minstrel performers in the late 19th century. Many folk festivals and fairs utilise dancing clubs or teams to perform both Buck and regular clogging for entertainment.\n\nTraditional Appalachian clogging is characterised by loose, often bent knees and a \"drag-slide\" motion of the foot across the floor, and is usually performed to old-time music.\n\nFour organizations sanction competitive events in the modern American clog dancing world.\n\nThe longest running of the organizations, the National Clogging and Hoedown Council, began in 1974 and is now a part of the C.L.O.G. National Clogging Organization. The sanctioning body hosts its annual grand championships at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee each Labor Day Weekend. The N.C.H.C. was influential in establishing the basic rules and scoring guidelines that have shaped clogging competition. Information about the organization can be found on its website at www.clog.org .\n\nAmerica's Clogging Hall of Fame (ACHF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of the old time square dance and clogging. ACHF was founded by Dan and Sandy Angel in 1981. ACHF holds its annual National Championships on the 4th weekend in October each year, unless it falls on Halloween, then it is moved to the third weekend in October.\n\nACHF sanctions many competitions throughout the year where teams and dancers can qualify to compete in the ACHF National Championship dance-off the last full weekend in October. Any team finishing 1st or 2nd with each dance in TWO sanctioned competitions qualifies to compete at the National Championships Dance-off.\n\nAmerica's Clogging Hall of Fame honors many of its dancers at the October Championships. An All-American Clogging Team is selected each year through a nominating and selection process in which 24 of our best dancers are chosen. ACHF also selects 16 dancers to the Junior All-American Team and 4 dancers to the Senior All-American Team each year. These dancers are showcased at the National Championships. Also honored at the National Championships are at least three individuals who are inducted into America's Clogging Hall of Fame. These inductees have been clogging for at least 25 years, 45 years in age, and have been a positive influence in the preservation of the dance. College scholarships are also awarded in October for up to three deserving students.\n\nThe ACHF competition year runs from November 1st to September 30th. A list of those competitions and information is available on the organization's website at www.achf.us. You can also look them up on Facebook under America's Clogging Hall of Fame. \n\nClogging Champions of America (C.C.A.) was formed in 1998 to generate more activity and interest in clogging and competition, to promote a spirit of fun and fellowship, and to make sure the beginner clogger will get to enjoy competing as much as the clogger who has been in it for years. The goal of C.C.A. is to create an atmosphere of spirited and sportsmanlike competition, and to provide more opportunities for cloggers within the competitive and entertainment realms. Competition, C.C.A. feels, is a healthy and entertaining part of clogging because it offers dancers the opportunity to travel to different locations – meeting new clogging friends, step sharing, and supporting each other competitively.\n\nC.C.A. devised a system to give the amateur dancers a chance to gain their self-esteem and prepare them to finally compete against more experienced teams. At any Clogging Champions of America affiliated event, a team qualifying as an Amateur – having never won a first place honour in a clogging competition, may compete under Amateur status now for two (2) C.C.A. calendar years, January to December. At each Clogging Champions of America event, the top three scoring teams in each category and division of Challenge, including Junior and Senior, will qualify to dance at the Showdown of Champions which will be held at the beginning of the following year. The top four scoring teams in each category of Amateur will also qualify for the next year's Showdown of Champions. You only need to qualify once per category, but you may dance at any or all affiliated competitions, and you will receive \"Star\" Points for doing so. In 2011, the C.C.A. organisation added a STARZ level of competition to its events which gives competitors the chance to be judged against a point system rather than each other, making every dancer recognised.\n\nTo recognise clogging's brightest, C.C.A. devised the Showdown of Champions, which brings together the winners from the best competitions in the country to compete under one roof. They also recognise the Solo dancer. First place Solo winners in each age division from each competition will qualify for the Showdown of Champions. The Showdown of Champions draws the most geographically diverse attendance of any of the sanctioning bodies, with teams from East to West Coast participating on a regular basis. The organisation's website is www.ccaclog.com\n\nAmerica Onstage is a clogging and dance competition circuit based in Utah. The organisation hosts events in Utah, Idaho and Arizona during the months of February through May culminating in a three weekend dance-off at Lagoon Amusement Park. The organisation's website is www.americaonstage.org. \n\nAlthough Clogging is a nationwide style of dance there is a varying difference between East coast and West coast. West coast tends to follow more closely to hip hop, Cheerleading, and Jazz styles of dance. While East coast tends to follow more of a modernized version of the classic clog and hoedown style. When several teams come together from each side of the US you can clearly see the difference. Competitions in which you will see such things would be the competition done in Las Vegas every 4 years or so. \n\nFusion, or the adding of new styles into another, has continued to affect clogging. Modern competitive clogging, also called precision clogging, is inspired by traditional styles but performed to a wide variety of music, including bluegrass, modern country, rock music, pop, and hip hop. Today competitive precision clogging has several sanctioning bodies that oversee competitions held throughout the United States, with the majority located in the southeastern states. The style has also evolved from flat foot to dancing on the balls of the feet. Toe stands are a recent adaptation from other dance forms. These high-energy styles have opened the forum to a wide audience with hundreds of workshops and competitions every year.\n\nClogging shoes are often black, white, or black and white, and generally have double taps or \"jingle taps\". There are four taps on each shoe—-two on the toe, and two on the heel. One is securely fastened to the shoe, while the other is more loosely fastened and hits both the floor and the fastened tap while dancing or simply walking about. Cloggers with this type of tap can be heard on carpet as well as hard surface floors.\n\nOne more recent example of clogging is the dance show \"America's Best Dance Crew\" on MTV, where Dynamic Edition danced their way through the 3rd season, all the way to 5th place. Another recent example of clogging is a talent show \"America's Got Talent\" on NBC, where Extreme Dance FX from Season 3 and Fab Five from Season 4 danced their way of clogging.\n\nGreen Grass style clogging is a relatively recent style of Appalachian \"folk clogging\" developed by and associated with the Green Grass Cloggers of Greenville, North Carolina (and later also of Asheville, North Carolina). They began in 1971 as students at East Carolina University in Greenville. Their style is not traditional flatfooting, nor is it traditional mountain-style clogging, or contemporary precision clogging, but it is a form of precision clogging in the sense that it features choreographed routines where the dancers are all dancing in unison (same steps at the same time), while moving through figures. The figures are taken from western square dancing, rather than from traditional southern Appalachian dancing. It is usually performed to old-time music.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Aguirre was chosen as the first overall pick of the 1981 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks after playing three years at DePaul University. Aguirre played in the NBA from 1981 until 1994 and won two championships with the Detroit Pistons after being traded to Detroit from Dallas in exchange for Adrian Dantley. Aguirre was a three-time All-Star for Dallas.\n\nWhile playing at DePaul University, he averaged 24.5 points over three seasons with the Blue Demons under coach Ray Meyer. In 1981, Aguirre was \"The Sporting News\" and Helms Foundation College Player of the Year. He also was the USBWA College Player of the Year and James Naismith Award winner in 1980, and a 2 time member of \"The Sporting News\"' All-America first team. As a freshman in 1978–1979, he led the Demons to the Final Four, where they lost to Indiana State, led by future Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Bird. \n\nThe Chicago native played alongside Terry Cummings at DePaul, and found himself in the national spotlight during his three years at the university. Aguirre averaged 24.0 points as a freshman in 1978–79, and led the Blue Demons to the NCAA Final Four. Over the next two seasons he scored 26.8 and 23.0 points per game, respectively, and was named College Player of the Year in 1980–81. \n\nAguirre was a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic basketball team but was unable to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. \n\nAguirre declared for the NBA draft after his junior year at DePaul. The Dallas Mavericks selected him with the first overall pick in the 1981 NBA draft.\n\nAguirre averaged 20 points per game over the course of his 13-year NBA career. He was selected as the first overall pick by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1981 NBA draft and remained with the Mavericks until 1989. In his first season Aguirre was limited to 51 games and averaged 18.7 points, second on the team to Jay Vincent (21.4 ppg). The Mavericks improved by 13 games in the win column and finished ahead of the Utah Jazz, but were still twenty games behind division-leading San Antonio Spurs.\n\nBeginning with the 1982–83 season Aguirre reeled off six straight campaigns in which his average topped 22 points per game. In the first of those seasons he scored 24.4 points per contest, tops on the team and sixth in the league. The Mavericks continued their ascent, bettering their record to 38-44 to finish ahead of Utah and the Houston Rockets in the Midwest Division. During the 1983-84 NBA season Aguirre averaged 29.5 points per game, second in the league to Dantley's 30.6 ppg. He finished the season with 2,330 total points.\n\nAlthough Aguirre was the Mavericks’ main weapon, he was helped by the emergence of Rolando Blackman (22.4 ppg) and the contributions of role players Brad Davis and Pat Cummings. Dallas finished second in the Midwest at 43-39, and the team made its first playoff trip, beating the Seattle SuperSonics in the opening round before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the conference semifinals. In each of the next two seasons the Mavericks posted identical 44-38 records. In 1984–85 they made a quick exit from the playoffs, bowing to the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round; in 1985–86 they defeated Utah and then took the Lakers to six games in the conference semifinals. Aguirre averaged 25.7 and 22.6 points for those seasons.\n\nIn 1986–87 and 1987–88 he made the All-Star Team and averaged 25.7 and 25.1 points, respectively, during the regular season. The Mavericks won more than 50 games each year. The 1987–88 edition of the franchise went 53-29, beat Houston and the Denver Nuggets in the first two rounds of the postseason, then extended the Lakers to seven games before losing in the Western Conference Finals. It was the longest postseason run in the Mavs’ eight-year history. Both Mavericks single-season scoring records still stand. His 13,930 points as a Maverick rank third in the franchise's history, behind Rolando Blackman's 16,643 points and Dirk Nowitzki's 31,560.\n\nWhile Aguirre's time in Dallas was full of high-scoring efforts and playoff visits, the Mavericks were postseason underachievers (their only Western Conference Finals visit was the 1988 loss to the Lakers), and Aguirre had repeated conflicts with coach Dick Motta and players like Blackman, Derek Harper and James Donaldson. Then-team owner Donald Carter was a huge fan of Aguirre and hoped he would remain in Dallas for his entire career, but eventually conceded that the gulf between Aguirre and the team was unbridgeable. Midway through the 1988–89 season Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Dantley, who was also one of the league's top scorers, and a first round draft pick on February 15, 1989.\n\nAfter Aguirre joined them, the Pistons won the NBA title in 1988-89 and repeated as champions in 1989–90. He showed he could blend into a successful team by taking fewer shots, playing hard on defense, and not complaining when Dennis Rodman's minutes increased greatly over time. In the 1990 playoffs, which culminated with a five-game Finals win over Portland, Aguirre averaged 11.0 points. Aguirre played three more seasons with the Pistons in an increasingly limited role, due to both Rodman's play and his own age and injury issues.\n\nIn 1993, the Pistons released Aguirre. After he cleared waivers the Los Angeles Clippers signed him for $150,000 for a partial campaign in 1993–94. Through the 1993–94 season Aguirre had accumulated 18,458 points for a career average of 20.0 points per game. He retired in 1994.\n\nAguirre has been married to Angela Bowman since January 1988. Aguirre, whose grandfather was from Mexico, at one point considered playing for team Mexico at the 1992 Olympics.\n\n\n\n"}

If this identification is correct, then it was during his reign that Christianity was introduced to Axum and the surrounding territories.\n\nW.R.O.

His \"Adoration\" in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Bologna, is not only his masterpiece but an excellent piece of vigorous painting.

He is most noted for his spells at Brann, but he did also play for Moss, Austria Wien and Fredrikstad. Kvisvik won the Norwegian Cup with Brann in 2004 and with Fredrikstad in 2006. He was capped eleven times for Norway scoring two goals.\n\nHailing from Greåker outside Sarpsborg, Kvisvik started his professional career at Moss in 1997, before he transferred to Brann in June 1998. In his Brann-debut, Kvisvik scored the equalizing goal in the 1–1 draw against Lillestrøm and he was given much of the honor when Brann avoided relegation in the 1998 season. He was also a part of the team that lost the Final of the 1999 Norwegian Cup and finished second in the 2000 Tippeligaen. Kvisvik and his teammate at Brann, Thorstein Helstad, joined Austria Wien for a combined fee of 16 million NOK in July 2002. Kvisvik returned to Brann after a season in Austria, and was once again credited for saving Brann from relegation during the 2003 season. After winning the 2004 Norwegian Cup with Brann, Kvisvik joined Fredrikstad in July 2005. When Fredrikstad won 3–0 in the 2006 Norwegian Cup Final against Sandefjord, Kvisvik assisted all of Fredrikstad's goals.\n\nAfter Kvisvik left Fredrikstad in 2009, Kvisvik has continued to play football at lower levels, for Kvik Halden in the 2. Divisjon, Sarpsborg FK and Greåker in the 5. Divisjon.\n\nKvisvik was included in a Norway national team squad for the first time in January 2000. He subsequently made his debut against Denmark when he played seven minutes as a substitute. After scoring goals in the friendly matches against Bahrain and Kuwait in January 2005, Kvisvik became a regular in Åge Hareide's national team squad.\n\nIn July 2006, Kvisvik launched a single, \"This Is For Real\", together with four other professional Norwegian footballers - Morten Gamst Pedersen, Freddy dos Santos, Kristofer Hæstad, and Øyvind Svenning. They call their band \"The Players\".\n\nKvisvik has also played for the Norwegian national floorball team (four games), and has won the Norwegian championships four times as a player with Greåker Bulldogs.\n\nRaymond Kvisvik is one of the few footballers in the world, together with the likes of David Beckham and Christiano Ronaldo, who has his own brand of perfume. It's called \"Super-Ray\", and it's now out of production. Kvisvik had the idea for the perfume together with a mate from his hometown Greåker, after they had drunk some pints at the local pub called Olavs pub.\n\nIn November 2006, Kvisvik was included in the Norwegian squad for the 2006 European Futsal Championship. Norway was eliminated in the quarter-final against Belgium, and Kvisvik scored two of the goals in the 3–6 defeat.\n\n\n"}

Sudhindranath is one of the most notable poets after the Tagore-era in Bengali literature.\n\nSudhindranath Dutt went to the Theosophical High School in Varanasi between 1914 and 1917, and later attended the Oriental Seminary in Kolkata. Later he graduated in English from the Scottish Church College. He later studied law at the Law College (1922–1924), while also simultaneously preparing for his finals for an MA in English literature from the University of Calcutta. However, he did not complete a degree (MA or a law degree) in either subject.\n\nBorn to renowned lawyer Hirendranath Dutta & Indumati Vasu Mallik (sister of Raja Subodh Chandra Vasu Mallik), Sudhindranath became an apprentice under his father's supervision, although he did not obtain a formal law degree. He married Chhabi Basu in 1924. <br>\nHe started publishing \"Parichay\", a literary magazine which heralded his philosophy, in 1931 and carried on with the job till 1943, when he left following ideological battle with his associates, but supplied funds nevertheless. He was also associated with \"Sabujpatra\", another noted literary magazine of the era, which was edited by eminent story-writer of the era, Pramatha Chaudhury. He also worked as a journalist for \"The Statesman\" from 1945-1949. He was also associated with the daily \"The Forward,\" then edited by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, as the organ of All India Forward Bloc.\nHe had also worked for several companies such as Light of Asia Insurance Company from 1930–1933, ARP from 1942–1945, DVC from 1949–1954, and Institute of Public Opinion from 1954-1956.\nHe worked as a part-time lecturer of Comparative Literature in Jadavpur University from 1956-1957. In 1957, he left for his final foreign trip and toured Japan and Europe before moving to United States of America to join University of Chicago to write his autobiography in English. However he left the lucrative job midway and returned home to rejoin Jadavpur University to resume his classes of Comparative Literature, which he continued till his death.\n\nSudhindranath Dutta believed that hard work is what is needed for creating art, and the embattled nature of his poetry contrasted with that of the romantic poetry of Jibanananda Das. When Jibanananda Das's poetry notebooks were printed, Dutt commented after seeing the great number of corrections and deletions in the notebooks \"Oh, then the natural poets are also unnatural poets, like me!\"\n\nPerhaps his most famous line is the widely quoted one from his poem \"Utpakhi\" (The ostrich):\n\n\n"}

The paper is only distributed on weekdays and is aimed at the working class. The estimated average daily circulation of the paper is around 900,000-1,000,000. The paper provides local and international news as well as articles on business news, entertainment, lifestyle and sports.\n\nThe newspaper was launched as the Chairman of Sing Tao News Corporation, Charles Ho Tsu Kwok (), felt there was room for the further development of free newspapers in Hong Kong in terms of content, distribution network and advertising formats.\n\nThe pace of life in Hong Kong is so fast and people are so busy that \"Headline Daily\" was established to meet the people's needs by providing them with first-hand information on the hottest daily topics in a manner as concise and lively as possible, while attempting to portray a \"positive\" and \"lively\" image to readers.\n\nIn terms of market competition, the \"Headline Daily\" was also launched in a bid to gain a greater market share of the territory's advertising market for Sing Tao News Corporation and to explore a new source of income for the corporation.\n\nDaily issues are distributed during morning peak hours from Monday to Friday, except on public holidays. It is distributed in more than 600 different places, among which there are now three fixed distribution media: McDonald's restaurants, KCR stations (except Tsim Sha Tsui East, Tai Wai, Racecourse and Sheung Shui Stations), and nearly 500 residential estates. Moreover, the papers are distributed at more than 100 fixed or non-fixed spots, including commercial buildings, bus/mini-bus stops and shopping malls all around Hong Kong. Readers may simply get a free issue from the eye-catching red shelves at most locations or from the staff at certain locations.\n\nThe newspaper targets the working population, who are usually too busy to read a large number of pages nor to read every piece of news in detail. However, these people are likely to grasp every chance to read newspapers for a short period when travelling or having breakfast.\n\nIn August 2005, a market research survey was conducted by Synovate, comparing the readership of 3 free newspapers in Hong Kong. The result shows that in the first three weeks of August, \"Metropolis Daily\", \"Headline Daily\" and \"am730\" respectively achieved 16%, 18% and 8% of the market shares. \"Headline Daily\" gains the leading readership of 893,000, compared with \"Metropolis Daily's\" 820,000 and \"am730's\" 401,000.\n\n\"Headline Daily\" shares news sources with the \"Sing Tao Daily\".\nThe paper aims to present the most important news of the day in a concise way so as to provide readers with up-to-date, yet comprehensive, news and information on different areas in a short read. It usually has around 24 to 30 pages and has a layout similar to the following formats:\n\n\nIn a comment by Sing Tao chief executive Lo Wing-hung, he claimed that the average number of pages could be increased to 40 pages if its readership increases significantly over time. However, so far, more than three months after the first publication, the newspaper only consists of around 24 pages on the average.\n\nAs more and more free newspapers are appearing to fight for room in the local newspaper market, \"Headline Daily\" distinguishes itself by bringing new experiences to its readers. It tries to be competitive by implementing marketing strategies to attract readers' interest, such as:\n\n\nMoreover, to extend the market to overseas, a softcopy version \"Headline Daily\" is made accessible on line.\n\nTo build up a good relationship with readers, \"Headline Daily\" invites readers to submit news articles for publication in return for rewards as a sign of its co-operation with the public. According to the official website, readers can become reporters for \"Headline Daily\" by handing in any information. While this information should be deemed to be news-worthy, other guidelines are provided on what type of news should be submitted. Particularly, the paper states that it has no interest in collecting any commentaries from the public. Meanwhile, the usage of any material submitted is solely dependent on the newspaper's discretion. The paper rewards any readers whose materials are published or utilised with a one-time sum of $100, regardless of how many times the paper uses these pieces of news.\n\nOn the first day of its publication, \"Headline Daily\" claimed that \"Headline news is important news, and different sections of the newspaper should have headlines. Not only the serious news has headlines, but also for entertainment news, let alone love affairs.\" This statement raised a controversy on whether \"Headline Daily\" is providing good journalism, which requires verification and objectivity rather than exaggerating the facts by making them headlines.\n\nTwo days after the first publication of \"Headline Daily\", the Hong Kong Newspaper Hawker Association accused \"Headline Daily\" of having an adverse impact on the business of newspaper hawkers. They claimed that the free distribution of \"Headline Daily\" had resulted in a general drop in newspaper transactions of around 10% to 20%.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Newspaper Hawker Association pointed out that under the current market conditions, it might be infeasible to decrease the prices of newspapers to maintain or increase their sales. Subsequently, they claimed to have considered taking \"Sing Tao Daily\" off their shelves to counter the threat posed by it.\n\nOn another front, the vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Newspaper Hawker Association, Lam, gave an example of the impact. Ten years ago, an ice-cutting competition which was initiated by \"Apple Daily\" had resulted in the elimination of several old-fashioned newspapers. Drawing a parallel with that phenomenon, Lam speculated that if the current situation of free distribution of newspapers continued, newspapers run by small corporations might eventually be eliminated. This might in turn result in the undesirable situation of reducing choice for newspaper readers.\n\nThree months after the launch of \"Headline Daily\", \"The Sun Daily\" was the first newspaper that initiated a price-cutting campaign as a response. On 19 October 2005, The Oriental Daily Group followed suit by cutting down the price of \"The Sun Daily\" to 50% from $6 to $3.\n\nAfter the launch of the two new free papers, \"Sing Tao Daily's\" advertising revenue dropped by 12% in August (compared with July), while \"Ming Pao Daily News\" and \"Sing Pao Daily News\" also suffered from a reduction in advertising revenues of 7% and 5% respectively.\n\nNevertheless, research figures indicate that the majority of free newspaper readers are 'new' readers or readers of both paid and free papers. The research concludes that even though the launch of free newspapers seems to have a negative causal effect on single copy sales of paid newspapers, the overall effect on readership and choices of newspapers might not be detrimental.\n\nAlso, it is suggested that readers who buy a paper everyday for its style and reputation are unlikely to change. Free newspapers would only lead to the repositioning or position enhancement of an individual newspaper. Free newspapers focus on the low-end market, while the priced newspapers target the middle-income class and professionals.\n\nThe Hong Kong Newspaper Hawker Association suggested that the free distribution of \"Headline Daily\" outside MTR stations might affect the smoothness of human flow along the passageways. The Association suggested that Sing Tao News Corporation should improve the method of distribution and requested the government to interfere and deal with the problem seriously.\n\nMoreover, some critics also think that free distribution may lead to greater wastage of paper. For example, a family with a few sets of free newspapers might end up throwing all of them into the dustbin directly without using them for other purposes as they did not pay for the newspapers. According to Friends of the Earth, on average, only 32% of newspaper-readers will dump their unwanted newspapers into recycle boxes. Since there are 500,000 issues of \"Headline Daily\" published every Monday to Friday, the wastage of paper and disposal problems may contribute significantly to the worsening of Hong Kong's pollution.\n\n"}

He is known primarily from inscriptions in South Arabia that mention him and his son BYGT (also vocalized as \"Beyga\" or \"Beygat\"). GDRT is thought to be the same person as GDR, the name inscribed on a bronze wand or sceptre that was found in an area near Atsbi and Dar'a/Addi-Galamo in northern Ethiopia. \n\nGDRT has been equated with the anonymous king of the Monumentum Adulitanum, which would date his reign c. 200 – c. 230. However, the two rulers are usually thought to be distinct. However the French scholar Christian Robin, studying the inscriptions at al-Mis`al in Yemen, has shown that GDRT, and his successor `DBH, lived in the earlier half of the 3rd century.\n\nThe inscriptions of GDR represent the oldest surviving royal inscriptions in the Ge'ez alphabet. The oldest of these was found at Addi-Galamo in the regions of Atsbi and Dar'a in eastern Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia. The area is rich in pre-Aksumite artifacts, and inscriptions of a pre-Aksumite kingdom called Dʿmt have been found in the region. The inscription mentioning GDR is the only evidence of his existence from the western side of the Red Sea:\n\nThe Addi Galamo inscription was written on a sceptre or \"boomerang-like object\"; the linguist A.J. Drewes therefore interprets \"mzlt\" as meaning a sceptre or royal emblem. The inscription's meaning is uncertain, but if \"mzlt\" is taken to mean a sceptre, and \"ʾrg\" and \"lmq\" are taken to be place names (or sanctuaries), then, according to Alexander Sima, the text could mean \"GDR, king of Aksum gave (this) sceptre into the possession of (the sanctuaries) ʾRG and LMQ.\" The South Arabian expert W.F. Albert Jamme, however, translates the inscription as \"GDR king of Aksum occupied the passages of `RG and LMQ\", or \"Gedara, King of Axum is humbled before the [gods] Arg and Almouqah,\" (i.e. Almaqah or Ilmuqah), assuming that the ʾ in Ilmuqah was assimilated.\n\nGDRT is first mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions as an ally of `Alhan Nahfan, king of Saba, in an inscription at Maḥram Bilqīs, at Ma'rib in Yemen, the temple of the moon god Almaqah /Ilmuqah. According to Stuart Munro-Hay, the inscription reads\n\nAlexander Sima translates the text slightly differently, specifying that it was GDRT who \"sent a diplomatic mission to [`Ahlan] in order to form an alliance.\" Both interpret \"Zararan\" or \"Zrrn\" as the name of the palace in Aksum at the time, parallel to \"Sahlen,\" the palace of Saba in Marib. This Sahlen-Saba parallel, along with the Dhu-Raydan-Ḥimyar parallel, was often used by Aksumite kings in their inscriptions enumerating the territories under their control. A Ḥimyarite inscription confirms the Sabaean text, mentioning that Aksum, Saba', Ḥaḑramawt, and Qatabān were all allied against Ḥimyar. `Alhan Nafhan's son Sha`ir Awtar or Sha`irum Awtar later abandoned the alliance with GDRT after he became king of Saba'. However, during the first part of Sha`ir Awtar's reign, the two powers seem to have joined in an alliance once again, this time against Ḥaḑramawt. Saba's invasion of Ḥaḑramawt with Aksumite help culminated in the latter's defeat and the occupation of its capital, Shabwah, in 225. Sha`ir Awtar's attack represented a major shift in policy as, before the attack, the king of Ḥaḑramawt, Il`azz Yalut, was married to his sister; he had even helped suppress a revolt against Il`azz Yalut.\n\nAlthough Saba' was previously allied with Aksum against Ḥimyar, both Ḥimyarite and Sabaean troops were used in the attack against Ḥaḑramawt. Immediately following the conquest of Hadramaut, Sha`ir Awtar allied with Ḥimyar against his former ally GDRT. A second Sabaean inscription from the sanctuary 'Awam in Marib during the reign of Sha`ir Awtar's successor, Luha`atht Yarhum, describes events in the latter part of his predecessor's reign. The inscription tells of a diplomatic mission sent by Sha`ir Awtar to GDRT, the results of which are unknown; however, the text later goes on to describe a war between Saba' and Aksum in the southern highlands of Yemen, implying that the negotiations were futile. Aksum lost a battle as a result of the Saba'-Ḥimyar alliance, allowing the South Arabian forces to expel GDRT's son BYGT and his forces from the Ḥimyarite capital Zafar, which had previously been held by Aksum after the Aksum-Ḥaḑramawt-Qatabān-Saba' alliance. Despite this loss, Aksum still held territory in South Arabia, as evidenced by inscriptions of Luha`atht Yarhum (r. c. 230), which detail at least one known clash with \"hbšt\" troops in Yemen after GDRT's reign. Peace may have been established after GDRT's death, but war and Aksumite involvement was renewed under his successors such as `DBH and GRMT, and the whole 3rd century was to be dominated by Ethio-Yemeni conflicts.\n\nGDRT was most likely the first Aksumite king to be involved in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihāmah, Najrā, Ma`afir, Ẓafār (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military alliances and his conquests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would mark the beginning of centuries of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of Yemen by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province covering all of South Arabia.\n\nGDRT's name may be preserved in Ethiopian tradition through the traditional king lists, as what seem to be variants of his name crop up in three of them. \"Gədur\" is listed as the third king in list C, \"Zegduru\" (\"ze\" meaning 'of' in Ge'ez) appears as the sixth in list E, and \"Zegdur\" appears as the third in list B, after the legendary Menelik I. Zegdur also is mentioned in at least one hagiography and short chronicle. The king lists were composed centuries after the fall of the Aksumite kingdom, however, and generally do not agree with archaeological records except when concerning famous kings.\n\n"}

Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili by throwing a hand grenade at them on 10 May 2005. The attempt failed when the grenade did not detonate. He was later arrested and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nVladimir Arutyunian, a Georgian citizen and ethnic Armenian, was born on 12 March 1978 in Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia. Arutyunian lost his father at an early age and lived with his mother, who was a stall-holder at the local street market. They lived in one of the poorest suburbs of Tbilisi. After completing his secondary education, he had no fixed occupation.\n\nHe joined the Democratic Union for Revival party led by Aslan Abashidze in January 2004, but soon after left the organization's ranks. He joined the Revival party in the same month Mikheil Saakashvili became president of Georgia, and had led Adjara in a crisis by refusing to obey the central government authorities. Saakashvili and his party were considered to be pro–United States, while Abashidze and his party were considered to be pro-Russia. The crisis had ended in later 2004 without bloodshed.\n\nOn 10 May 2005, Arutyunian waited for the United States President George W. Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to speak in Tbilisi's central Liberty Square. When Bush began speaking, Arutyunian threw a Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade, wrapped in a red tartan handkerchief, toward the podium where Bush stood as he addressed the crowd. The grenade landed from the podium, near where Saakashvili, his wife Sandra E. Roelofs, Laura Bush, and other officials were seated.\n\nThe grenade failed to detonate. Although original reports indicated that the grenade was not live, it was later revealed that it was. After Arutyunian pulled the pin and threw the grenade, it hit a girl, cushioning its impact. The red handkerchief remained wrapped around the grenade, and it prevented the striker lever from releasing. A Georgian security officer quickly removed the grenade, and Arutyunian disappeared.\n\nArutyunian later said that he threw the grenade \"towards the heads\" so that \"the shrapnel would fly behind the bulletproof glass\". Bush and Saakashvili did not learn of the incident until after the rally.\n\nOn 18 July 2005 Georgia's Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili issued photos of an unidentified suspect and announced a reward of 150,000 lari (US$80,000) for information leading to the suspect's identification.\n\nAt the request of the Georgian government, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation began an investigation into the incident. Extra manpower was brought in from the surrounding region to help with the investigation. In one picture of the crowd, the FBI noted a man in the bleachers with a large camera. He was a visiting professor from Boise, Idaho. FBI agents contacted him and, with his photographs, were able to identify a suspect.\n\nOn 20 July 2005, acting on a tip from a hotline, police raided Arutyunian's home where he lived with his mother. During an ensuing gunfight, Arutyunian killed the head of the Interior Ministry's counterintelligence department, Zurab Kvlividze. He then fled into the woods in the village of Vashlijvari on the outskirts of Tbilisi. After being wounded in the leg, he was captured by Georgia's anti-terror unit.\n\nDNA samples from the man matched the DNA samples from the handkerchief. Georgian police later found a chemical lab and a stockpile of explosives Arutyunian had built up in his apartment. Twenty liters (5.3 U.S. gallons) of sulfuric acid, several drawers full of mercury thermometers, a microscope, and \"enough dangerous substances to carry out several terrorist acts\" were found.\n\nAfter his arrest, Arutyunian was shown on television admitting from his hospital bed that he had thrown the grenade. He said that he had attempted to assassinate both presidents because he hated Georgia's new government for being a \"puppet\" of the United States. He further stated that he did not regret what he did and would do it again if he had the chance.\n\nArutyunian initially admitted his guilt when arrested but refused to cooperate during the trial. He pleaded not guilty, then refused to answer questions in court. His lawyer Elisabed Japaridze said after the conviction and sentencing that she would appeal. \"I consider that everything was far from proved.\" She cited the fact that Arutyunian's fingerprints were not found on the grenade. However, prosecutor Anzor Khvadagiani said that the grenade being wrapped in cloth explained the lack of distinguishable fingerprints and also that DNA tests of material found on the cloth matched Arutyunian's.\n\nOn 11 January 2006 a Georgian court sentenced Arutyunian to life imprisonment for the attempted assassination of George Bush and Mikheil Saakashvili, and the killing of Officer Kvlividze. In September 2005, a United States federal grand jury also indicted Arutyunian, and could ask to extradite him if he is ever released. He is not eligible for parole, and could only be released under a presidential pardon, but such pardons are almost never granted in Georgia. This means that Arutyunian will most likely spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nWhile in prison in February 2010, Arutyunian converted from the Armenian Apostolic Church to Islam.\n\n"}

The total race distance was 21 stages and a prologue over . In honor of the Maastricht Treaty, which created the European Union, the Tour visited a record seven countries: France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and Italy.\n\nThere were 22 teams in the 1992 Tour de France, each composed of 9 cyclists. Sixteen teams qualified because they were the top 16 of the FICP ranking in May 1992; six other teams were given wildcards in June 1992.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\nMiguel Indurain, winner of the 1991 Tour de France, was the clear favourite, having won the 1992 Giro d'Italia with ease. His biggest rivals were expected to be Gianni Bugno (second in the 1991 Tour) and Claudio Chiappucci (second in the 1992 Giro).\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 13.\n\nThe prologue was in San Sebastián, close to Indurain's home. Indurain won the prologue, with debutant Alex Zülle in second place. In the first stage, Zülle won a time bonus in an intermediate sprint, and became the new race leader.\n\nIn the second stage, Richard Virenque, another debutant who was a late addition to his team, was part of a two-man escape that stayed away, and took over the lead.\nThe yellow jersey, worn by the leader in the general classification, changed owner again after the third stage, when a group of ten cyclists stayed away, and Pascal Lino, a teammate of Virenque at , became the new leader. In the team time trial of stage four, lost time to the teams specialized in team time trials, but Lino's lead was large enough to remain leader.\n\nIn the time trial in stage nine, Indurain took his chance to win back time on Lino and Virenque and his rivals: Indurain won the stage, three minutes faster than all other cyclists. This time trial victory is sometimes seen as Indurain's career-defining moment.\n\nThe major mountain stages were stages 13 and 14. Chiappucci won stage 13, and won back some time on Indurain who finished in third place; Chiappucci climbed to the second place in the general classification. In the fourteenth stage, Chiappucci and Indurain finished together. After this stage, Indurain lead the race with only Chiappucci within two minutes; all other cyclists were more than eight minutes behind. With no big mountain stages remaining, the only stage that was likely to create time differences between the favourites was the time trial in stage nineteen. Indurain, being a time trial specialist, won that stage, and increased his margin to more than four minutes.\n\nIndurain thus won his second Tour de France.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1992 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey in 1992. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Claudio Chiappucci won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. In 1992, there was an special classification because of the Maastricht Treaty, that created the European Union. In the 1992 Tour de France, a national border was crossed seven times, and every time there was a special sprint, where points could be earned. This classification was won by Viatcheslav Ekimov. The \"Association Française pour un Sport sans violence et pour le Fair-play\" awarded the Fair Play award in the Tour for the first time. It was given to Stephen Roche. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 14. This prize was won by Franco Chioccioli.\n\n"}

{"id": "2281317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281317", "title": "Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase", "text": "Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase\n\nNucleoside-diphosphate kinases (NDPKs, also NDP kinase, (poly)nucleotide kinases and nucleoside diphosphokinases) are enzymes that catalyze the exchange of terminal phosphate between different nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) and triphosphates (NTP) in a reversible manner to produce nucleotide triphosphates. Many NDP serve as acceptor while NTP are donors of phosphate group. The general reaction via ping-pong mechanism is as follows: XDP + YTP ←→ XTP + YDP (X and Y each represent different nitrogenous base). NDPK activities maintain an equilibrium between the concentrations of different nucleoside triphosphates such as, for example, when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) produced in the citric acid (Krebs) cycle is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other activities include cell proliferation, differentiation and development, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor, endocytosis, and gene expression.\n\nNDPK are homo hexameric proteins made up of monomers approximately 152 amino acids long with a theoretical weight of 17.17KDa. The complex is found in mitochondria and in the soluble cytoplasm of cells.\n\nNDPK are found in all cells, displaying not much specificity towards the types of nucleoside bases and are capable of accepting nucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates or donors. Therefore, NDPK is the source of RNA and DNA precursors, except ATP.\nNDPK utilize specific enzyme kinetics for multi-substrate reaction, namely ping-pong mechanism. A ping-pong mechanism integrates phosphorylation of a histidine residue by transferring terminal phosphate group (γ-phosphate) from ATP to NDP β-phosphate in order to produce a NTP, and NDPK catalyzes such reversible reactions. NTP phosphorylates a histidine, which in turn phosphorylates NDP. NDPK are involved in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP), such as guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP).\n\nBehind this apparently simple reaction is a multistep mechanism. The key steps of transphosphorylation are as follows:\n\nEach step is part of a reversible process, such that the multistep equilibrium is of the following form.\n\nNDPK’s roles in these NTPs differ; generally, kinases bring in NTPs for nucleic acid synthesis. CTP is provided for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis while GTP is used for protein elongation and signal transduction.\nDuring cAMP-mediated signal transduction, NDPK is responsible for phosphorylating GDP released from G proteins activated from receptor binding; once ATP donates a phosphate group via activity of NDPK, GTP is consecutively bound. Increased activity of membrane-associated NDPK yields cAMP synthesis.\nNDPK controls K+ channels, G proteins, cell secretion, cellular energy production, and UTP synthesis.\n\nNDPK usually consumes ATP, the most abundant cellular nucleotide, and stores the nucleotides. However, consumption of ATP would definitely influence the cellular energy balance, which brings upon the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as the energy sensor and regulates ATP pathways by turning the generating pathways or not. Because of such activity, AMPK could directly inhibit NDPK through phosphorylation. To be more specific, NDPK supports the production of nucleotides in high-energy and low-stress cellular states. However, this can only happen when AMPK is inactivated because low-stress cellular states of ATP triggers the activation of AMPK, which eventually decreases NDPK activity by phosphorylating serine residues.\n\nIn most prokaryotes, the NDPK enzyme is tetrameric. It has been reported in a number of pathogens. NDPK function has been studied in \"Escherichia coli\", \"Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Microccocus luteus, and Myxococcus xanthus\". Prokaryotic NDPK forms a functional homotetramer. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity involves the transfer of the γ-phosphate of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to nucleoside diphosphate (NDP), where N1 and N2 can be ribo- or deoxyribonucleosides. This is done via a high energy phosphohistidine intermediate. Besides involvement in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, prokaryotic NDPK is also involved in several metabolism cycles. NDPK has also been discovered to act as a protein histidine kinase, which involves a reversible histidine phosphorylation as a well-known regulatory signal. However, in most prokaryotes, NDPK expression levels are involved in the cell growth, development and differentiation of the organism, especially bacteria. \nIn the (p)ppGpp biosynthesis cycle, NDPK serves an important role. When there is an absence of a charged tRNA in the A site of a ribosome, the ribosome will stall and trigger the synthesis of the guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) molecule. (p)ppGpp biosynthesis is a part of the purine metabolism pathway and coordinates a series of cellular activities in response to nutritional abundances. Synthesis of (p)ppGpp is triggered by carbon starvation, or the lack of carbon in the cell's environment, and causes the protein SpoT to activate. SpoT works in conjunction with NDPK and both serve as essential enzymes in the (p)ppGpp biosynthesis cycle. NDPK synthesizes the formation of GDP from GTP via dephosphorylation.\n\nWhile the biomolecular mechanism by which the Nm23 gene works in cells is currently unknown, like in most prokaryotes, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) expression levels determine cell growth and differentiation. Normally, the Nm23 gene (NME) is involved in metastasis suppression in humans. In prokaryotes, the Nm23 gene is involved in normal cell development and differentiation. Highly conserved homologues of the Nm23 gene have been found in prokaryotes, more specifically, \"Myxococcus xanthus\", a gram negative soil bacteria. Homologues of Nm23 in \"M. xanthus\" have been closed and characterized as a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (ndk gene) and seems to be essential for \"M. xanthus\" growth. During \"M. xanthus\" development, nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity has also been shown to drastically decrease.\n\nThere are at least four enzymatically active isoforms of NDPK in humans: NDPK-A, NDPK-B, NDPK-C and NDPK-D. All four isoforms have very similar structures and can combine in any form to become functional NDPK hexamers. NDPK is suggested to participate in transmembrane signaling in eukaryotic cells.\n\nIn Eukaryotic systems, the role of the NDK is to synthesize nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP. The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate, and synthesize products such as UTP. NDK possesses nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate kinase, histidine protein kinase, and 3'-5' exonuclease activities. Its processes are involved with cell proliferation, differentiation and development, and gene expression in human cells. It is also part of the neural development process, which includes neural patterning and cell fate determination. Furthermore, NDPK is involved with the signal transduction processes and G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis as it transfers a phosphate group onto the G β-subunits and convert GDP to GTP. This increase in GTP concentration near G protein α-subunits causes activation of G protein α-subunits for G-protein signaling. In addition to signaling, NDPK is involved in controlling K+ channels, cell secretion, and cellular energy production.\n\nThe biochemical reactions catalyzed by NDP kinase in plants are analogous to activities described in humans as autophosphorylation activity takes place from ATP and GTP. In addition to this, plants have four types of NDPK isoforms. Cytosolic type I NDPK is involved in metabolism, growth, and stress responses in plants. Type II NDPK is concentrated in the chloroplast and it is believed to be involved in the photosynthesis process and the oxidative stress management, but its function is not yet known clearly. Type III NDPK targets both mitochondria and chloroplast, and it is mainly involved in energy metabolism. The localization and exact function of the type IV NDPK is not yet well known and needs further investigations. In addition, NDPK is associated with H2O2-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in plants.\n\nTen paralogous genes code for the proteins NDPKs, which are separated into two groups. The first group encodes proteins with NDPK functions. The other group genes code for other various proteins that display low or no NDPK activities. In the first group, one of the genes named NM23 was identified as the first metastasis suppressor protein and its gene Nm23 was less activated in metastatic cells. In a different experiment, human Nm23 was cultured with cancer cells and showed inhibition of metastasis. The level of NM23 protein was inversely proportional to the metastatic potential for human solid tumors. However, other tumor types such as ovarian cancers, neuroblastoma and hematological malignancies displayed upregulated NM23 levels in patient samples. Therefore, understanding the biological basis of the Nm23 gene family is necessary to have a firm knowledge of its diverse results.\n\nNme2, one of the NDPK genes, has been associated with cardiovascular functions. Nme2 gene is known to form a complex with the beta subunit of the heterotrimetric G protein in heart cells and regulates the contractility of heart. There are two functions of Nme2 that allow for such regulation; one is the histidine kinase activity, which is the phosphorylation of the channels to regulate what goes through and the other is a scaffold function of the formation of caveolae. The depletion of Nme2/caveolin interaction exhibited a decreased rate of cardiac contractility. Furthermore, more studies with zebra fish revealed that the NDPK depletion has a detrimental effect on heart functioning.\n\nThere was a lot of debate on whether NM23 gene is responsible for suppressing or activating metastasis. The two contradicting sides on this subject remained ambiguous and undefined throughout the course of NDPK studies. However, recent experiments began to show evidence for NM23 being a suppressor of metastasis. Nme2 was tagged as an anti-metastasis gene, using the tissue chip technology and immunohistochemistry. When Nme2 gene products were over-produced in gastric cancer cells, there was a decrease in proliferation, migration, and invasion of such cancer cells. The cell cultures revealed that Nme2 impacts gastric cancer cells, but the question still remains about what regulates Nme2 activities among various cancer types. Nme1 was found in great number in poorly metastatic sublines of melanoma cells. Also, the transfection of Nme1 into a highly metastatic melanoma line significantly reduced metastasis. This theory has been tested with mice as well; the Nme1-deficient mice formed greater lung metastases than wild type mice, showing that this gene has suppressing activity. Invasion of cancer occurs due to changes in cell adhesion and it is caused by gene expression changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Surprisingly, there are many adhesion molecules, motility factors, signaling pathways, proteolytic events, EMT hallmarks, and other transcriptional programs that have been linked to the Nme1 proteins. These proteins go about interrupting metastasis by binding metastasis-promoting proteins. The Nme1 proteins bind to viral proteins, oncogenes, and other metastasis-promoting factors. The binding may be indirect by using the signaling complex.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281328", "title": "Justin Dart Jr.", "text": "Justin Dart Jr.\n\nJustin Whitlock Dart Jr. (August 29, 1930 – June 22, 2002) was an American activist and advocate for people with disabilities. He helped to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, co-founded the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), and is regarded as the \"Godfather of the ADA\".\n\nDart came from a wealthy Chicago family. His father, Justin Whitlock Dart Sr., was president of Dart Industries. His mother Ruth Walgreen Dart was the daughter of Walgreen founder Charles R. Walgreen and his wife Myrtle Walgreen. Justin's brother Peter Dart also developed polio.\n\nDart contracted polio in 1948 before entering the University of Houston, where he earned undergraduate degrees in history and education in 1954; however, the university refused to give him a teaching certificate because of his disability. The university is now home to the Justin Dart Jr. Center for Students with Disabilities, a facility designed for students who have any type of temporary or permanent health impairment, physical limitation, psychiatric disorder, or learning disability.\n\nDuring his time at the University of Houston, which was then segregated, Dart organized the first student group to oppose racism.\n\nAfter graduating, Dart was a successful entrepreneur who founded three Japanese corporations, but in 1967 he gave up the corporate life to devote himself to the rights of people with disabilities, working in Texas and Washington, D.C. as a member of various state and federal disability commissions. In 1972, Dart switched from identifying as a Democrat to become a Republican.\n\nHe opposed the efforts of President Ronald Reagan, a personal friend of the Dart family, to revise the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and in 1981 accepted an appointment from President Reagan to be the vice-chair of the National Council on Disability.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Dart worked closely with both Democratic and Republican Members of Congress to advance the rights of disabled people, including U.S. Congressman Major Owens of New York City, who served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Education in the U.S. House of Representatives during the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as during the early crafting of the legislative language and the fierce debates on the Americans' With Disability Act (ADA) before its eventual passage in the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile serving as the vice chair of the National Council on Disability, Justin and Yoshiko Dart embarked on a nationwide tour, at their own expense, to meet with activists and individuals with disabilities. This tour, which took them to every state in the U.S., was a significant undertaking for both the Darts and the individuals that were visited. At the time of the Darts' tour, accessibility and universal design still were being developed in major cities and in smaller municipalities. To complete their journey, the Darts often had to find transportation and housing that could accommodate Justin Dart and his colleagues' wheelchairs. There weren't facilities that were readily available in every town that the Darts visited. Justin and Yoshiko did not make these trips alone, often partnering with local disability advocates, community members and friends. For many of the people with whom the Darts met, this was the first time that anyone had ever asked them as individuals with disabilities what they wanted from their government and country. Based on these conversations, Dart and others on the council drafted a national policy that called for national civil rights legislation to end the centuries-old discrimination of people with disabilities, what would eventually become the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nIn 1986, Justin was appointed to lead the Rehabilitation Services Administration, a federal agency under the United States Department of Education tasked with administering portions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Dart's tenure at RSA ended when at a congressional hearing he characterized the agency as \"a vast, inflexible federal system which, like the society it represents, still contains a significant portion of individuals who have not yet overcome obsolete, paternalistic attitudes about disability.\" Though he was asked to resign, Dart remained a functioning figure in disability policy even at the federal level, and in 1988, he was appointed co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities.\n\nThe Darts undertook another tour of the United States with the purpose of continuing a national dialogue about disability. Again with the support of friends and disability advocates, they visited all 50 states as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia to hold public forums that were attended by more than 30,000 people. This consistent advocacy and long-term conversation is what ultimately earned Justin the title of \"Godfather of the ADA\" as the information, network and diligence became the foundation of the legislative conversation around the ADA.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was signed into law on July 26, 1990. The signing ceremony included with President George H.W. Bush, Evan Kemp, Rev. Harold Wilke, Sandra Parrino, and Justin Dart. \nIn 1993, Dart left his position on the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. Subsequently, Dart founded Justice for All with other activists to defend against congressional attempts to weaken the ADA, including those pushed for by Clint Eastwood. He also organized numerous ADA anniversary events. After the 1994 Congressional elections, Dart left the Republican party and eventually became a strong supporter of President Clinton.\n\nOn July 25, 1995, Justin Dart founded the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) with Paul Hearne, Senator Bob Dole, John Kemp, Tony Coelho, Pat Wright, Jim Weisman, Lex Frieden, Sylvia Walker, Paul Marchand, Fred Fay, I. King Jordan, Denise Figueroa, Judi Chamberlin, Bill Demby, Deborah Kaplan, Nancy Bloch, Max Starkloff, Mike Auberger, Neil Jacobson, Ralph Neas, Ron Hartley and others.\n\nDart suffered a series of heart attacks in late 1997, which curtailed his ability to travel. He continued, however, to lobby for the rights of people with disabilities, and attended numerous events, rallies, demonstrations and public hearings. Toward the end of his life, Dart was hard at work on a political manifesto that would outline his vision of \"the revolution of empowerment.\" In its conclusion, he urged his \"Beloved colleagues in struggle, listen to the heart of this old soldier. Our lives, our children’s lives, the quality of the lives of billions in future generations hangs in the balance. I cry out to you from the depths of my being. Humanity needs you! Lead! Lead! Lead the revolution of empowerment!\"\nDart received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the ceremony, Clinton said Dart had \"opened the doors of opportunities to millions of our citizens by securing passage of one of the nation's landmark civil rights laws.\"\n\nHe died in Washington, D.C. on 22 June 2002 at the age of 71 from congestive heart failure related to complications of post-polio syndrome.\n\nFor many members of the disability community especially in the Washington, D.C. area, Justin Dart is an icon for the modern disability movement and the ideals of inclusion, advocacy and leadership. In his final statement to the community for his death, Dart wrote:\n\nEnding with his closing of \"Lead On\", Dart's words have become a call for action and engagement for many who advocate for the issues of inclusion, and for all who believe in action and justice. Dart's usual wardrobe of a Stetson hat with a pin of the American flag on the band and cowboy boots have become symbols of the disability rights movement.\n\n"}
{"id": "2281335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281335", "title": "Am730", "text": "Am730\n\nAm730, is free daily Cantonese newspaper published in Hong Kong, the third with the prior two being \"Headline Daily\" and \"Metropolis Daily\". Shih Wing-ching, chairman of \"Centaline Holdings\", a property agency, is the founder of the newspaper. He introduced the new paper due to the unprecedented success of \"Metropolis Daily\", a pioneer in this market. \"Metropolis Daily\" was founded in 2002, and was so successful that it broke even in only fourteen months. Realising the profitability of the market, Shih established \"am730\" in late July 2005\n\nOwned and operated by AM730 Media Limited, \"am730\" launched its first publication on 30 July 2005. It had been scheduled to be launched in September, but it was rescheduled to 30 July to keep up with one of its competitors, \"Headline Daily\", which was launched on 12 July 2005, and for convenient coincidence that the date of 30 July (730) corresponded with the name of the newspaper. Two hundred thousand copies of \"am730\" were issued at its first publication and its current circulation volume is around three hundred thousand copies daily.\n\nThe name of the newspaper is intended to suggest a fresh approach towards the methodology of naming newspapers. It does not incorporate the term \"daily\" because this word reflects the conventional way of naming a news journal. The name literally states the newspaper's aim to distribute the publication during rush hour, which is approximately 7:30am.\n\nAccording to Shih, the newspaper is tailored to young people. 7:30am is about when the sun rises; it signals vitality, just like the young people who are at the start of a long journey through life. It is a new vision aimed to change the old quality of Hong Kong newspapers. In its first week, \"am730\" sold one hundred thousand copies. Eventually, it aims to increase circulation to three hundred thousand copies, which is similar to the other two free newspapers (\"Metropolis Daily\": 300,000; \"Headline Daily\": 400,000).\n\nIn January 2014, Shih revealed that many mainland companies were cancelling advertising with the paper, for its perceived anti-Beijing editorial stance.\n\nThe journal tends to adopt internet slang and other expressions which are widely used on the Internet and popular among youth. The newspaper official says it is advisable to use internet slang and does not think that colloquial expressions in newspaper articles will affect young people's language proficiency. What is more crucial is using popular language to convey messages. \"am730\" intends to offer a fresh sensation in news to its readers; it aims to widen the horizon of its readers, both internationally and culturally, and to promote an optimistic outlook on life and hopes for the future.\n\nWhile being consistent with market regulations, \"am730\" is a real newspaper which offers more attention to journalistic principles. Unlike numerous other newspapers, \"am730\" is against the idea of indecent news as the selling point. It wants to provide a newspaper with accurate, simple news reports targeted to youth who have just begun their careers. The fresh, youthful style of \"am730\" is designed to encourage more young people to read newspapers. Shih hopes that through this free newspaper, young people in Hong Kong will cultivate a greater interest in the news and in the future of Hong Kong.\n\n\"Headline Daily\", a newspaper which belongs to \"Sing Tao\", is the primary competition for \"am730\". Shih admits that \"Headline Daily\" has more resources than the privately investigated \"am730\" because of its attachment to \"Sing Tao Daily\", but that dependence on Sing Tao would harm the independence of its organisation.\n\nThe paper includes local, China, international, financial, entertainment and sports news. Additionally, Shih Wing Ching writes a column called \"C Viewpoint\" in which he gives his daily commentary on local or international news. \"730 Angle\" is also a commentary column, but for people from all walks of life. \"Snapshot Hong Kong\" is a column which cold-contacts youngsters on the street to ask their opinions. Hence, the major target of \"am730\" is the young working class and it defines itself as a youth publication in the newspaper market. The reason for this, in Shih's own words, is because young people are full of hope: \"Local papers follow the western view in that they will only report bad things, as if there is no hope in this world, yet hope is what young people mostly need.\" The design and layout of the paper are colourful and appealing.\n\nThe detailed layout of the newspaper is as follows:\n\nThe lead story of the day occupies almost the entire page of the paper, filled in with colourful illustrations. The other stories vary from local top stories to China and international news.\n\nSimilar to a traditional newspaper, on the left corner is a column which briefly highlights the news of secondary importance that is available inside the paper. The highlights vary, including local, China, international, entertainment and sport news. At the bottom of the column is a display of the Mark Six results.\n\nTypically, around three to four pages are allocated to the local news section. More important news such as politics and policies are reported in greater length than city news such as accidents and events. To maximise space usage, even the banner at the top of the page is used to cover brief news accounts. Shih's personal column, \"C Viewpoint,\" can also be found in this section.\n\nThere is also a column for weather forecasts for local, China and international locations. The banner of this section is sky-blue in colour.\n\nNews from China and related to China's interests takes up about one to two pages of the paper. The banner colour of this section is khaki.\n\nThe international section covers major news around the world. The banner colour of this section is dark blue.\n\nWhen this section appears, it is placed in the middle of the paper and covers two pages, but it is not always printed. At times, the middle pages are occupied by a full-page advertisement. Feature stories, when available, offer in-depth reports and analysis.\n\nThis is a short, concise one-page section on financial and business news, both locally and on the international arena. The banner colour of this section is dark green.\n\nThe Sports section covers both the local and the international sports scene. On average it provides a scoreboard summary of final scores and, on occasion, a brief schedule of live sports coverage on television. The banner colour of this section is light green.\n\nThe I.T. section is dedicated to news of technological advancement and electronic products, including mobile phones, computers, television and much more. Not to be missed is news of the Internet and recommended websites. The banner colour of this section is light green.\n\nThe Notes section usually offers articles of interesting, sometimes absurd events happening around the world. The banner colour of this section is purple.\n\nThis section is dedicated to young working women, similar to those offered in popular women's magazines. Besides tips and advice on women's health and beauty, there is also a section dedicated to relationship advice for women readers with personal problems. The banner colour of this section is pink.\n\nThis section offers entertainment news regarding celebrities, music and movies. There are usually two pages dedicated to this section. One page focuses on local Hong Kong celebrities, while the other covers international celebrities. There are occasional extras in this section such as movie reviews and basic introductions of a foreign language. The banner colour of this section is mustard yellow.\n\n\"730 Angle\" offers letters and readers' opinions on various issues. There is also a small section on events and book reviews. On the right hand corner is a \"snapshot\" section dedicated to teen fashion and trends, including the mobile phones they use.\n\nThis section that relates tips and overviews of leisure activities. Generally this section contains comics, western horoscopes, tarot predictions of the future, and cooking tips and recipes.\n\nThis section provides a selected schedule of programmes offered on both local and cable television. At the bottom section, there is a review of some recommended programs. Last but not least are the credits of the editorial team as well as a list of contacts for the newspaper.\n\nThe back page of the paper is typically occupied by a full-page advertisement.\n\nGenerally, the news accounts presented are brief and limited, due at least in part to space limitations. As \"am730\" is a free newspaper, the operating cost largely depends on the advertisement revenue. A full-page advertisement appears on every other page, mainly placed between the local news section and the finance section. Smaller advertisements are scattered throughout the newspaper. Nevertheless, the newspaper remains an effective and rapid way to inform commuters about current issues in Hong Kong and the rest of the world.\n\nCurrently, the editorial team consists of 50 people. Key staff are :\n\n\nShih promised his staff that if the revenue and expenditures could be balanced within the first year, he would pay them seven more months of salary.\n\nThe initial launch of the newspaper cost up to HK$100 million. It was Shih's private investment. At the first stage, working capital was just HK$50 million; another HK$50 million will be invested if the operation proves successful. Shih Wing-ching expects that revenue and expenditures will be balanced after a year of publication.\n\nAs a free newspaper, the major operational revenue is gained from commercial advertisements. After the first month of publication, the revenue gained from commercial advertisements was HK$100 million while \"am730\" still needed to bear HK$100 million to HK$200 million in losses everyday. The advertising rates in \"am730\" are estimated to be HK$24,000 – HK$30,000, 30% to 40% lower than \"Metropolis Daily\"'s rates of HK$32,000 to HK$40,000. This is a strategic action to attract more advertisements.\n\nFrom July 2013, under a six-year contract, the paper is printed by the South China Morning Post Group.\n\n\"am730\" is distributed from Mondays to Fridays (except public holidays) at around 287 locations. Distribution locations include railway stations along the East Rail Line and West Rail Line, the entrances of Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations, private residential areas, and many points in the Central business district (or CBD).\n\nDue to limited human resources and the specific target group of \"am730\", early distribution points were not as efficient. Its main focus is now in the commercial districts of Hong Kong such as Central, Wan Chai and Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\n\"am730\" is also accessible online. Besides viewing the most recent issue, readers can also view archived issues of \"am730\" online. The e-paper is formatted in such a way that it resembles the actual printed paper.\n\n\"am730\" frequently offers free coupons. Readers can enjoy special offers by cutting the coupons published in the paper. One example was the \"Delifrance\" tea set offer on 10 October 2005.\n\nAccording to Shih, free newspapers represent the future trend of print news because they avoid conflict between readers and newspapers. The fact that \"am730\" is convenient and free of charge has attracted a large group of readers away from the conventional newspapers. Besides the advantages of large circulation and a large group of readers, free newspapers attract many advertisers. According to a survey, \"Metropolis Daily\" advertisements ranked 6th in Hong Kong newspapers. It has thus become a big challenge for traditional newspapers to keep up with free newspapers. Starting 19 October 2005, \"The Sun\", one of the newspapers under the Oriental Press Group Limited, cut the retail price for each paper to HK$3. It is believed to be responding to the emerging competition brought up by free newspapers. Other newspaper press groups declared they would not follow this action, but would closely monitor the situation.\n\nWith the emergence of \"Headline Daily\" and \"am730\" into Hong Kong's print media industry in July 2005, the competition among the numerous newspapers (free and traditional) is becoming increasingly stiff and unhealthy. In fact, the existence of free circulated tabloids in general can be seen as a form of \"self killing\" in the industry, in which free tabloids are \"killing off\" the traditional broadsheets in terms of readership and advertising revenue. Besides this, the saturated market of three free tabloids in Hong Kong can also result in non-profitability for weaker competitors.\n\nAnother effect of the entry of \"am730\" and other free tabloids into the market will be on the advertising revenue for traditional broadsheets. Being highly dependent on advertising revenue, traditional broadsheets now face intense competition from free tabloids that are also dependent on advertising revenue as a primary source for their survival. A major advantage of \"am730\" is its easy accessibility to its readers. This means that despite higher advertising charges, companies might be willing to advertise in these papers to guarantee a higher exposure level for their products.\n\nThere are 3 main Chinese free newspapers (the other two are \"Metropolis Daily\" and \"Headline Daily\") and millions of copies are issued every day (two hundred thousand copies of \"am730\", three hundred thousand copies of \"Metropolis Daily\" and four hundred thousand copies of \"Headline Daily\"). In a survey conducted by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong in July 2005, by interviewing 1006 residents, 60% to 65% reported they had taken free newspapers, but 48.7% (nearly half) would throw the newspaper into rubbish bins instead of a recycle box. This practice is not only creating waste, but is also causing damage to the natural environment; for every metric ton of paper used, 17 trees are brought down and 1,500 litres of fuel oil are consumed.\n\nA survey on Hong Kong free tabloid readership by Synovate, a leading research company, was conducted between 1 August 2005 and 21 August 2005. \"Metro Daily\", \"Headline Daily\" and \"am730\" have 16%, 18% and 8% of the total market share, respectively. From these figures, one can see that \"am730\", with a low circulation of around 260,000 in comparison with the other two tabloids, is performing reasonably well for a starter.\n\n\"am730\" aims at expanding the readership of the young working class. With its primary target of readers in the younger demographic range, \"am730\" has achieved its target; 65% of its readers are below 45 years of age, according to the survey. This could be seen as an achievement for the free tabloids whose professed aim is to raise awareness of current issues for the politically apathetic younger generation.\n\n\"am730\" is able to get a majority of its readers from the full-time working class, accounting for 81% of its readership according to the survey. This proves that the distribution of papers at railway stations does help in gaining accessibility to working class readers who commonly use public transportation.\n\nAlso, \"am730\" has a low readership from people in managerial positions, according to the survey. This is also true for other free tabloids. Generally, the percentage of professionals reading free tabloids only made up 7% of the total readership. In making their stories short and brief, \"am730\" and other tabloids are definitely seen as lacking depth among higher-educated individuals.\n\nNewspaper vendors are upset because of falling sales in traditional newspapers, which directly harms their income. Hence, the vendors are seeking a deal with publishers of free newspapers to distribute the papers for a fee, and threaten to mount a noisy campaign if their requests are denied.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2281336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281336", "title": "Brucella", "text": "Brucella\n\nBrucella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria, named after David Bruce (1855–1931). They are small (0.5 to 0.7 by 0.6 to 1.5 µm), nonencapsulated, nonmotile, facultatively intracellular coccobacilli.\n\n\"Brucella\" spp. are the cause of brucellosis, which is a zoonosis transmitted by ingesting contaminated food (such as unpasteurized milk products), direct contact with an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols. Transmission from human to human, for example through sexual intercourse or from mother to child, is exceedingly rare, but possible. Minimum infectious exposure is between 10 and 100 organisms.\n\nThe different species of \"Brucella\" are genetically very similar, although each has a slightly different host specificity. Hence, the National Center for Biotechnology Information taxonomy includes most \"Brucella\" species under \"B. melitensis\".\n\nThe many names of brucellosis include (human disease/animal disease):\n\nThe Italian doctor and pathologist Aldo Castellani discovered evidence of trypanosomas in the \"liquor cerebrospinalis\" of ill patients. Sir David Bruce isolated \"B. melitensis\" from British soldiers who died from Malta fever in Malta. After exposure to \"Brucella\", humans generally have a two- to four-week latency period before exhibiting symptoms, which include acute undulating fever (>90% of all cases), headache, arthralgia (>50%), night sweats, fatigue, and anorexia. Later complications may include arthritis or epididymo-orchitis, spondylitis, neurobrucellosis, liver abscess formation, and endocarditis, the latter potentially fatal.\n\nHuman brucellosis is usually not transmitted from human to human; people become infected by contact with fluids from infected animals (sheep, cattle, or pigs) or derived food products, such as unpasteurized milk and cheese. Brucellosis is also considered an occupational disease because of a higher incidence in people working with animals (slaughterhouse cases). People may also be infected by inhalation of contaminated dust or aerosols, and as such, the CDC has labeled \"Brucella\" species as highly weaponizable.\nHuman and animal brucellosis share the persistence of the bacteria in tissues of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. \"Brucella\" can also target the male reproductive tract.\n\nGlobally, an estimated 500,000 cases of brucellosis occur each year.\n\nMalta fever was a major health problem to British troops in Malta in the 19th and early 20th centuries, resulting in over 6000 cases and 574 deaths. In 1860, J.A. Maraston, assistant surgeon in the British Army in Malta, gave the first accurate description of the disease he called \"Mediterranian gastric remittent fever\".\nIn 1897, A.E. Wright, a pathologist in British army, developed the agglutination test, diagnostic of the disease.\n\nIn 1905, Zammit, a Maltese physician, identified goats as the source of infection. E. Bang, a Danish veterinarian, described the intracellular pathogen causing abortion in cattle in 1897, and named it \"Bacillus abortus\". In 1918, A. Evans, an American microbiologist, made the connection between\" B. abortus\" and\" Micrococcus melitensis\", and placed them in the Bacteriaceae.\n\nIn 1914, Mohler isolated an organism from the liver and spleen of pigs, \"B. suis\"; \"B. neotome\", \"B. ovis\", and \"B. canis\" were described in 1957, 1963, and 1966, respectively.\n\nZoonosis affecting domestic animals is caused by contact with milk, urine, and genital organs, which concentrate the causative organisms. Some reservoirs include buffalo and other animals, but mostly cattle. In humans, the disease is acquired from unpasteurised milk and products or undercooked meat (consumers), laboratory inhalation (lab workers), accidental skin penetration or abrasion (farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians), and (rarely) conjunctival contact, blood transfusion, transplacental, and person-to-person.\n\nBrucellosis can affect any organ or organ system, and 90% of patients have a cyclical (undulant) fever. Though variable, symptoms can also include these clinical signs: headache, weakness, arthralgia, depression, weight loss, fatigue, and liver dysfunction. Foul-smelling perspiration is considered a classical sign. Between 20 and 60% of cases have osteoarticular complications: arthritis, spondylitis, or osteomyelitis. Hepatomegaly may occur, as can gastrointestinal complications.\n\nUp to 20% of cases can have genitourinary involvement; orchitis and epididymitis are most common. Neurological symptoms include depression and mental fatigue. Cardiovascular involvement can include endocarditis resulting in death.\n\nChronic brucellosis is hard to define; length, type, and response to treatment are variable. Localized infection can occur. Blood donations of infected persons should not be accepted.\n\nCongenitally infected infants can exhibit low birth weight, failure to thrive, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, respiratory difficulty, and general signs of sepsis (fever, vomiting). Some cases are asymptomatic.\n\n\"Brucella\" species are small, Gram-negative, facultative coccobacilli, most lacking a capsule, endospores, or native plasmids. They are intracellular within the host organism, and show environmental persistence outside the host. The intracellular trafficking includes two or three main steps, starting with endosomal vacuoles, then endoplasmic reticulum-derived compartments and finally vacuoles having several markers of atypical autophagy. They survive extremes in temperature, pH, and humidity, and in frozen and aborted materials. They infect many species, but with some specificity.\n\nThe \"Brucella\" species belongs to the Rhizobiales group, in the Alphaproteobacteria class. They are growing by unipolar growth, like \"Agrobacterium tumefaciens\", \"Sinorhizobium meliloti\", and \"Ochrobactrum anthropi\". They usually have two chromosomes and their replication and segregation are temporally organized.\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract is affected in about 70% of cases, including anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The liver is involved in most cases, but function tests are normal or mildly abnormal. Granulomas (\"B. abortus\"), hepatitis (\"B. melitensis\"), and abscesses (\"B. suis\") are seen.\n\nThe skeletal system is affected in 20–60% of cases, including arthritis (hip, knee, and ankle), spondylitis, osteomyelitis, and sacroiliitis (most common). Lumbar vertebrae can be affected showing the classical radiological sign of vertebral erosion. Neurological symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, intracerebral abscesses, and acute or chronic neck rigidity (<50%), and the cerebrospinal fluid can show lymphocytic pleocytosis, low sugar, increased protein, positive bacterial culture (<50%), and agglutination (positive in >95%).\n\nCardiovascular involvement is low (endocarditis at 2%), but is the major cause of mortality. Often, valve replacement and antibiotics are needed. Pericarditis and myocarditis are seen, too.\n\nPulmonary infection can be from inhalation or hematogenous sources, and can cause any chest syndrome. Rarely is\" Brucella\" isolated from sputum. Genitourinary infection can include epidydemoorchitis or pyonephrosis (rare). Cutaneous involvement is not specific. Hematological signs include anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n\"Brucella\" is isolated from a blood culture on Castaneda medium or from bone marrow. Prolonged incubation (up to six weeks) may be required, as they are slow-growing, but on modern automated machines, the cultures often show positive results within 7 days. On Gram stain, they appear as dense clumps of Gram-negative coccobacilli and are exceedingly difficult to see. In recent years, molecular diagnostic techniques based on the genetic component of the pathogen have become more popular.\n\nDifferentiating \"Brucella\" from \"Salmonella\" is crucial, as the latter could also be isolated from blood cultures and is Gram-negative. Testing for urease would successfully accomplish the task; it is positive for \"Brucella\" and negative for \"Salmonella\". \"Brucella\" can also be seen in bone marrow biopsies.\n\nLaboratory-acquired brucellosis is common. This most often happens when the disease is not thought of until cultures become positive, by which time the specimens have already been handled by a number of laboratory staff. The idea of preventive treatment is to stop people who have been exposed to \"Brucella\" from becoming ill with the disease.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) shows promise for rapid diagnosis of \"Brucella\" species in human blood specimens. Positive PCR at the completion of treatment is not predictive of subsequent relapse. PCR testing for fluid and tissue samples other than blood has also been described. A history of animal contact is pivotal; in endemic area, it should be in the diagnosis of any nonspecific febrile illness.\n\nIn the laboratory, biochemical tests can be diagnostic. Oxidase and catalase tests are positive for most members of the genus \"Brucella\".\n\nSerum agglutination with a titer > 1:160 in the presence of a compatible illness supports the diagnosis of brucellosis. Demonstration of a four-fold or greater increase or decrease in agglutinating antibodies over four to 12 weeks provides even stronger evidence for the diagnosis.\n\nELISA is probably the second-most common serologic method. The sensitivity of the ELISA was 100% when compared with blood culture, but only 44% compared with serologic tests other than ELISA. The specificity was >99%. In a study including 75 patients with brucellosis, five patients with positive ELISA had a negative tube agglutination test.\n\nIn the setting of \"Brucella\" arthritis, the synovial-fluid white blood cell count does not generally exceed 15,000 cells/μl. In brucellosis, lymphocytes frequently predominate (in contrast to septic arthritis due to other bacteria, in which polymorphonuclear leukocytes frequently predominate.\n\nThe prognosis for brucellosis before the use of antibiotics had a mortality of 2%, mainly due to endocarditis, and morbidity was high, especially with \"B. melitensis\". Permanent nerve deafness and spinal cord damage often occurred.\n\nPrevention now includes:\n\nNo clinical trials exist to be relied on as a guide for optimal treatment, but an at least six-week course of rifampicin or gentamicin and doxycycline twice daily is the combination most often used, and appears to be efficacious; the advantage of this regimen is that it is oral medication with no injections; however, a high rate of side effects (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite) has also been reported.\n\nAs of August 2013, Allison Rice-Ficht, Ph.D. at Texas A&M University and her team claim to be close to creating a human vaccine. It would primarily be used to immunize members of the military in case of exposure to weaponized \"Brucella\" on the battlefield.\n\n\"Brucella\" species have been found primarily in mammals:\n\nPathogenic \"Brucella\" species can cause abortion in female animals by colonization of placental trophoblasts, and sterility in male animals. Drugs with effects against \"Brucella\" include tetracyclines, aminoglycosides (streptomycin, [since 1947], gentamicin, netilmicin), rifampicin, quinolones (ciprofloxacin), and third-generation cephalosporins. Treatment for uncomplicated brucellosis includes:\n\nTreatment of complicated brucellosis (endocarditis, meningitis) has no uniform agreement, but usually uses three anti-\"Brucella\" drugs for three months.\n\nBrucellosis caused by \"B. abortus\" best fits the characteristics of the plague described in \"Oedipus Rex\". Although the disease progression of brucellosis in modern times may make it seem unlikely, it was at least one agent in what may have been a multicomponent plague, along with \"Salmonella enterica\" serovar Typhi or another pathogen, or possibly the ancestral versions of \"Brucella\" were more lethal.\n\nThe \"Brucella\" genome includes two chromosomes; the first chromosome codes mostly for genes related to metabolism, while the second (smaller one) includes several genes related to pathogenicity. The genomes of most \"Brucella\" species have been sequenced, and typically encode 3,200 to 3,500 open reading frames (ORFs). Examples include:\n\nGenome data for these and other \"Brucella\" strains are available in the GOLD and PATRIC databases. Also, a public and editable spreadsheet of \"B. abortus\" 2308W genome annotation has been created, to be updated based on new discoveries. Also, the genome annotation is available in a user friendly table at the web page https://www.babo2308w.una.ac.cr.\n\nBacterial small RNAs (sRNA) are an important class of regulatory molecules. Many \"Brucella\" sRNAs have been identified.\n\nInfection of macrophages by \"B. abortus\" is stimulated by blue light in the wild type, but is limited in photochemically inactive and null mutants, indicating a flavin-containing histidine kinase functions as a photoreceptor regulating \"B. abortus\" virulence. Conversely, depriving \"Brucella\" of the blue wavelengths dropped its reproductive rate by 90%.\n\n"}

It is also sometimes used for poaching vegetables, eggs, sweetbreads, cockscombs, and delicate meats.\n\nCourt bouillon loosely translates as 'briefly boiled liquid' (French \"court\") or \"short broth\" because the cooking time is brief in comparison with a rich and complex stock, and generally is not served as part of the finished dish. Because delicate foods do not cook for very long, it is prepared before the foods are added. Typically, cooking times do not exceed 60 minutes.\n\nAlthough a court bouillon may become the base for a stock or fumet, in traditional terms it is differentiated by the inclusion of acidulating ingredients such as wine, vinegar, or lemon juice. In addition to contributing their own flavor, acids help to draw flavors from the vegetable aromatics during the short preparation time prior to use. Court bouillon also includes salt and lacks animal gelatin.\n\nTraditionally, court bouillon is water, salt, white wine, vegetable aromatics (mirepoix of carrot, onion, and celery), and flavored with bouquet garni and black pepper.\n\nCourt-bouillon need not be elaborate. Court bouillon used to prepare lobster may be as simple as water, salt, lemon juice, and perhaps thyme and bay leaf; that for poached eggs may be salt, water, and vinegar.\n\nIn Louisiana Creole and Cajun cuisines, court-bouillon — often spelled \"courtbouillon\" — refers to a thick, rich fish stew most often prepared with catfish and thickened with roux.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2281341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281341", "title": "Rock Me Amadeus", "text": "Rock Me Amadeus\n\n\"Rock Me Amadeus\" is a song recorded by Austrian musician Falco, for his third studio album \"Falco 3\" (1985). The single was made available for physical sale in May 1985 in German-speaking Europe, through A&M. \"Rock Me Amadeus\" was written by Falco along with Dutch music producers Bolland & Bolland. The single became the only German language song to peak at number one of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on 29 March 1986.\n\nIt topped the singles charts on both sides of the Atlantic. It was Falco's only number one hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom, despite the artist's popularity in his native Austria and much of Europe.\n\nOriginally recorded in German, the song is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, his popularity and his debts. A longer version (eight minutes), named the \"Salieri Mix\", appeared on the initial US release of the album \"Falco 3\". The song was inspired by the movie \"Amadeus\". For the US release, the song was remixed with an English background overlay. There was never a full English version.\n\nVoiceover facts\n\nThe song was released in Europe in 1985 in its original, German-language version. For the international markets (United States, UK, Japan etc.), several different single and extended mixes were produced by Rob Bolland; none of them were solely an English-language version, but the international single versions reduced the German lyrics. However, the video, which featured the original European version, was used worldwide.\n\n\nThe song's music video mixes elements of Mozart's time with 1980s contemporary society. Falco is shown in a 20th-century-style dinner jacket, walking past people in eighteenth-century formal wear. Later, he is shown dressed as Mozart, with wild colored hair, being held on the shoulders of men dressed in modern motorcycle-riding attire. At the end, the two crowds mix.\n\nThe video for the 1991 remix is a much more sexualized version, starting with the refrain 'sugar sweet', with extra footage spliced throughout, including a similar black carriage riding at night with the driver covered in lights, escorted by police motorcycles, scantily clad girls; in black leather riding outside it, and bright neon fashions inside, resembling earlier-century formal wear. A different crowd in a more Mozart-era formal attire was excessively fraternizing at a party. This version also contains red line art of Falco, guitar riff clips, and a long car scene driving away at the end, to a saxophone solo over the added refrain.\n\nWith \"Rock Me Amadeus\", Falco became the first German-speaking artist to be credited with a number-one single in all mainstream US pop singles charts: the Billboard Hot 100 and Cash Box Top 100 Singles. Prior to Falco, \"99 Luftballons\" by Nena got to number one on Cash Box, but peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The single hit number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on 29 March 1986.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where his \"Der Kommissar\" failed to make the charts, the song hit number one on 10 May 1986, becoming the first single by an Austrian act to achieve this distinction. \"Vienna Calling\" hit number 10 and three subsequent singles briefly charted.\n\nIn Canada, the song reached number one on 1 February 1986. (There, \"Der Kommissar\" had reached number 11 in January 1983, and \"Vienna Calling\" would hit number 8 in April 1986.)\n\n\"Rock Me Amadeus\" would later be ranked number 87 in VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s and number 44 in VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2281342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281342", "title": "Saturday Night's Main Event", "text": "Saturday Night's Main Event\n\nSaturday Night's Main Event is a professional wrestling television program that was produced by the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE). Premiering in 1985, it originally aired on NBC as 29 occasional replacements for \"Saturday Night Live\" until 1991, then twice on Fox in 1992. It was revived in 2006 for five NBC episodes before ending in 2008.\n\nAt the time of the original airing, it was a rare example of professional wrestling being broadcast on an over-the-air commercial television network after the 1950s. It coincided with and contributed to the apogee of the \"second golden age\" of professional wrestling in the United States. In a time when weekly programming consisted primarily of established stars dominating enhancement talent, \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was made up almost entirely of star vs. star bouts, including title matches and specialty matches such as steel cage matches, handicap matches, etc.\n\nAll episodes of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" are available for streaming on the WWE Network, some slightly altered. May 1985–January 1988 episodes do not have the original opening and closing theme songs. Sponsored segments that aired as part of the original broadcasts such as the \"Mountain Dew Slam of the Night\" have been removed as well.\n\n\"Saturday Night's Main Event\" debuted on May 11, 1985 in the late-night time slot normally assigned to reruns of the NBC sketch comedy \"Saturday Night Live\". Then-SNL executive producer Dick Ebersol had made a deal with WWF owner Vince McMahon to produce the show, after Ebersol had seen the high ratings that two WWF specials drew on MTV in 1984–85. Although the show aired infrequently, it did, starting in 1986, settle into a predictable pattern of airdates: New Year's weekend, an episode in late February/early March, an episode in late April/early May, an episode in late September/early October, and Thanksgiving weekend. 1989 and 1990 both offered episodes in July promoted as \"Summertime Bonus Editions.\"\n\"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was a tremendous ratings success for NBC during its heyday, most notably on the March 14, 1987 show, which drew an 11.6 rating, which to this day remains the highest rating any show has ever done in that time slot. That show was headlined by a battle royal involving Hulk Hogan and André the Giant, who were slated to face each other at WrestleMania III. As Hogan rarely wrestled on the WWF syndicated and cable television shows, \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was the program on free television where most viewers were able to see him in action. The success of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" led to several Friday night prime time specials, known as \"The Main Event\". The first of these, on February 5, 1988 included a WrestleMania III rematch between Hogan and André and drew 33 million viewers and a 15.2 rating, which is still the highest-rated television show in American professional wrestling history.\nWhile ratings remained strong through 1990, they began to fall shortly thereafter. NBC, who had just acquired the rights to broadcast NBA games nationwide, now started to lose interest in wrestling, and \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was dropped. Its final NBC airing occurred on April 27, 1991. Fox picked up the show in 1992, but it was only shown twice on that network; February 8, 1992 and the final \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" of the original run was broadcast on November 14, 1992.\n\nFor much of its history, \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was hosted by McMahon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura with the occasional use of Bobby Heenan in 1986 and 1987. In 1990, Roddy Piper replaced Ventura as McMahon's broadcast partner when Ventura left the WWF. On the two episodes that aired on Fox, Heenan served as McMahon's partner. From 1985–1988 the opening theme song for the NBC version was \"Obsession\" by Animotion with the closing theme being \"Take Me Home\" by Phil Collins, and also the beginning of \"Take On Me\" by a-ha was used for show bumpers. Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" was also used as a closing theme. In February 1988, the songs were replaced with an original WWF-created instrumental theme. The new instrumental theme was originally used as the theme of the 1987 WWF Slammy Awards. A different opening theme song was used for the February 1992 episode.\n\nWhen WWE's flagship show, \"Raw\", returned to the USA Network in 2005, \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" was revived in 2006 as a \"special series\" to air on occasion on NBC as part of a deal between WWE and NBC Universal. The Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand rosters appeared on the show.\n\n\"Saturday Night's Main Event\" returned to NBC on March 18, 2006, in a prime-time slot.

Ark. 1982), was a 1981 legal case in the US state of Arkansas.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by various parents, religious groups and organizations, biologists, and others who argued that the Arkansas state law known as the Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act (Act 590), which mandated the teaching of \"creation science\" in Arkansas public schools, was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nJudge William Overton handed down a decision on January 5, 1982, giving a clear, specific definition of science as a basis for ruling that creation science is religion and is simply not science. The ruling was not binding on schools outside the Eastern District of Arkansas but had considerable influence on subsequent rulings on the teaching of creationism.\n\nArkansas did not appeal the decision and it was not until the 1987 case of \"Edwards v. Aguillard\", which dealt with a similar law passed by the State of Louisiana, that teaching \"creation science\" was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, making that determination applicable nationwide.\n\nAct 590 had been put forward by a Christian fundamentalist on the basis of a request from the Greater Little Rock Evangelical Fellowship for the introduction of legislation based on a \"model act\" prepared using material from the Institute for Creation Research. It was opposed by many religious organizations and other groups.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit, who opposed the \"balanced treatment\" statute, were led by the Reverend William McLean, a United Methodist minister.\n\nThe other plaintiffs were:\n\nThe defendants were the Arkansas Board of Education and its members, in their official capacity, the director of the Department of Education, in his official capacity, and the State Textbooks and Instructional materials Selecting Committee. The Pulaski County Special School District and its directors and superintendent were named in the original complaint but were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs at the pre-trial conference on October 1, 1981.\n\nVarious state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution had been introduced in the 1920s. They were challenged in 1968 at \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" which ruled that \"The law's effort was confined to an attempt to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the Biblical account, literally read. Plainly, the law is contrary to the mandate of the First, and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\" The creationist movement turned to promoting teaching creationism in school science classes as equal to evolutionary theory.\n\nArkansas Act 590 of 1981, entitled the \"Balanced Treatment for Creation Science and Evolution Science Act,\" mandated that \"creation science\" be given equal time in public schools with evolution.\n\nCreation science was defined as follows:\n\"Creation science means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:\n\nEvolution science was defined as follows:\n\"Evolution-science\" means the scientific evidences for evolution and inferences from those scientific evidences. Evolution-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:\n\nThe Act was signed into law by Governor Frank D. White on March 19, 1981.\n\nJudge William Overton's ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that \"creation-science\" as defined in Arkansas Act 590 \"is simply not science\". The judgment defined the essential characteristics of science as being:\n\nOverton found that \"creation science\" failed to meet these essential characteristics for these reasons:\n\nThe creationists' methods do not take data, weigh it against the opposing scientific data, and thereafter reach the conclusions stated in [the Act] Instead, they take the literal wording of the Book of Genesis and attempt to find scientific support for it. The Act took a two-model approach to teaching identical to the approach put forward by the Institute for Creation Research, which assumes only two explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Creationists take this to mean that all scientific evidence which fails to support the theory of evolution is necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism. The judgment found this to be simply a contrived dualism which has no scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose.\n\nThe judge concluded that \"the Act was passed with the specific purpose by the General Assembly of advancing religion,\" and that it violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\n\nThe test that Overton developed on the basis of Michael Ruse's testimony was later criticized by the philosopher of science Larry Laudan who argued that rather than call Creation Science \"non-science\" it would have been more cogent to show that it was \"bad science\". Chandra Wickramasinghe was the single scientist testifying for the defense of creationism. He hypothesized on panspermia and on \"the possibility of high intelligence in the Universe and of many increasing levels of intelligence converging toward a God as an ideal limit.\" \n\n\n"}

It consisted of 20 stages, over a distance of .\n\nThe winner of the previous two years, Miguel Indurain, successfully defended his title. The points classification was won by Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, while the mountains classification was won by Tony Rominger.\n\nThe organisers of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), felt that it was no longer safe to have 198 cyclists in the race, as more and more traffic islands had been made, so the total number of teams was reduced from 22 to 20, composing of 9 cyclists. The first 14 teams were selected in May 1993, based on the FICP ranking. In June 1993, six additional wildcards were given; one of which was given to a combination of two teams, and Subaru. The Subaru team did not want to be part of a mixed team, so Chazal was allowed to send a full team.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\nInvited teams\n\nThe defending champion Miguel Indurain was the big favourite, having won the 1993 Giro d'Italia earlier that year.\n\nThe route was unveiled in October 1992. Most team directors expected it to be more difficult than the 1992 Tour de France. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the Cime de la Bonette loop road on stage 11.\n\nThe 1993 Tour started in the same way as the 1992 Tour: Indurain won, with Alex Zülle in second place. The next stages were flat, and all finished in mass sprints. After the second stage, sprinter Wilfried Nelissen had collected enough time bonuses to become leader in the general classification.\n\nThe team time trial in stage four was the first stage with significant effects on the general classification. Banesto (Indurain's team) came in seventh, losing more than one minute, but the biggest loser was Tony Rominger, whose Clas team lost more than three minutes.\n\nThe contenders for the overall victory saved their energy in the next few stages, and cyclists who would not be a threat in the mountains were allowed to break away, with only the sprinters' teams trying to get them back. The sixth stage was run with an average speed of almost , at that moment the fastest mass-start stage in the Tour.\n\nIn the ninth stage, an individual time trial, the general classification changed. Indurain was a lot faster than the other cyclists, winning the stage with a margin of more than two minutes, and became the new leader in the general classification.\n\nThe next stages were in the Alps. Tony Rominger attacked, trying to win back time. Although he was able to win the stage, Indurain had followed him closely, so Rominger did not win back any time. Other pre-race favourites lost considerable time this stage and were no longer in contention, such as Claudio Chiappucci, who lost more than eight minutes.\n\nIn the eleventh stage, Rominger tried it again. But again, Indurain stayed with him. Rominger won the stage again, but the margin to Indurain stayed the same. Rominger did jump to the fourth place in the general classification, because Erik Breukink lost almost ten minutes.\n\nThe next three stages were relatively flat, and the top of the general classification stayed the same. In the fifteenth stage, Pyrenean climbs were included. The stage was won by Oliverio Rincón, the only survivor of an early breakaway. Behind him, Rominger again tried to get away from Indurain, but was unable to do so.\n\nIn the sixteenth stage, again in the Pyreneés, Rominger was finally able to get away from Indurain, but the margin was only three seconds. The seventeenth stage was the last stage with serious climbs, so the last realistic opportunity to win back time on Indurain, but this did not happen, so it seemed certain that Indurain would become the winner.\n\nThe rest of the podium was determined in the individual time trial in stage 19. It was won by Rominger, with Indurain in second place. Rominger thus climbed to the second place in the general classification.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1993 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Massimo Ghirotto won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 10. This prize was won by Tony Rominger. The fair-play award was given to Gianni Bugno.\n\n\n"}

The concerto consists of four movements and lasts approximately 20 minutes. It premiered in Weimar on February 17, 1855, with Liszt at the piano and Hector Berlioz conducting.\n\nThe main themes of Liszt's first piano concerto are written in a sketchbook dated 1830, when Liszt was nineteen years old. He seems to have completed the work in 1849, yet made further adjustments in 1853. It was first performed at Weimar in 1855, with the composer at the piano and Hector Berlioz conducting. Liszt made yet more changes before publication in 1856. Béla Bartók described it as \"the first perfect realisation of cyclic sonata form, with common themes being treated on the variation principle\".\n\nThe concerto consists of four relatively short movements:\n\nThe orchestra introduces the main theme of the piece with a powerful motif. It has been said that, to mock his critics, Liszt and his son-in-law, Hans von Bülow, put the words \"Das versteht ihr alle nicht, haha!\" (none of you understand this, ha-ha) to the notes of the opening two bars. The piano then comes in with an octave passage, spanning four octaves. A duet ensues between the piano and the clarinet in a quiet and peaceful passage, which is soon taken over again by the main theme. Following this, the piano plays fast, downward chromatic octaves, before recapitulating a section from earlier in the movement, this time in G major. The movement finishes with the main theme played by the strings while the piano imitates a harp with fast, quiet arpeggios, culminating with an upwards chromatic scale in sixths, diminishing to \"ppp\" volume.\n\nThe cellos and double basses introduce the Adagio section in a serene, unison cantabile, before the rest of the string section joins. Again, however, the cellos and double basses descend before the piano joins, in una corda. The piano uses the string theme and develops it further, playing in a nocturne-like style with soft, flowing left hand arpeggios and a cantabile melody in the right hand. The section reaches a climax where a strong fortissimo is played followed by a descending diminuendo scale.\nAfter a brief general pause, the whole orchestra resumes, again playing the same theme. Then a cello plays the theme while the piano answers hurriedly with a developmental recitative section. This leads into a passage where solos in the woodwind section play a new theme while the piano plays long trills in the right hand and spread chords in the left. The passage is ended by the piano and clarinet in duet.\n\nThe triangle starts the movement with the string section following it. (The frequent and prominent use of the triangle lead the critic Eduard Hanslick to mock the work as a \"Triangle Concerto\".) The piano develops the theme further. This occurs throughout the whole movement, however previous themes from the last two movements are re-introduced and combined together to give this concerto its unique rhapsody-like form. This movement is decidedly jocular in character, with the performance direction at the start of the piano line of \"capriccioso scherzando\", and delicate, playful duets between the woodwind and piano occurring throughout. The second half of the movement, however, takes a darker turn, when the piano, after concluding the scherzo section, plays an eerie, tremolando passage in the lower registers, with a development of the first theme played above, at dynamic. After this, the downward chromatic octaves reappear, but this time at level, before the orchestra plays an ascending chromatic section, leading into a tonal recapitulation of the first theme. The movement ends with very similar music as the first movement begins, with a blistering piano passage ending in an F diminished seventh chord (r.h.: F–A-flat–D–F).\n\nA descending E-flat major scale is played before the orchestra plays the theme of the Adagio in thematic transformation. The piano follows this with a blistering solo octaves passage before joining in duet with various solo woodwind instruments in a dainty, lively section. The movement continues bringing in all the themes from throughout the concerto and combining them sequentially. In the final few passages, a new chromatic theme is introduced in which the piano is playing semiquavers and triplet quavers at the same time, an exercise in polyrhythm, while in unison with the strings. The piece ends in Liszt's bravura style, with the now-familiar downward chromatic octaves theme, played in this recapitulation at breakneck presto speed, before changing to contrary chromatic octaves, reaching the tonic key of E-flat major and dynamic. The orchestra alone has the last two notes, which Liszt carefully utilised to highlight the importance of the orchestra in the piece, not just as an accompanying device for the piano.\n\nThis concerto is scored for a relatively small orchestra and calls for the following instruments:\n\nSolo piano\n\nWoodwinds:\n\nBrass:\n\nPercussion:\n\nStrings:\n\n"}

{"id": "2281366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281366", "title": "Mischief rule", "text": "Mischief rule\n\nThe mischief rule is one of three rules of statutory interpretation traditionally applied by English courts. The other two are the \"plain meaning rule\" (also known as the \"literal rule\") and the \"golden rule\".\n\nThe main aim of the rule is to determine the \"mischief and defect\" that the statute in question has set out to remedy, and what ruling would \"suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy\". In applying the mischief rule, the court is essentially asking what part of the law did the law not cover, but was meant to be rectified by Parliament in passing the bill.\n\nThe rule was first set out in \"Heydon's Case,\" a 16th-century ruling of the Exchequer Court.\n\nIn \"Conway v Rimmer\" it was observed that judges can apply in statutory interpretation in order to discover Parliament's intention. In applying the rule, the court is essentially asking what the mischief was that the previous law did not cover, which Parliament was seeking to remedy when it passed the law now being reviewed by the court.\n\nThe mischief rule is of narrower application than the golden rule or the plain meaning rule, in that it can only be used to interpret a statute and, strictly speaking, only when the statute was passed to remedy a defect in the common law.\n\nLegislative intent is determined by examining secondary sources, such as committee reports, treatises, law review articles and corresponding statutes.\n\nThe application of this rule gives the judge more discretion than the literal and the golden rule as it allows Parliament's intent to be taken into consideration.\n\nThe way in which the mischief rule can produce more sensible outcomes than those that would result if the literal rule were applied is illustrated by the ruling in \"Smith v Hughes\" [1960] 2 All E.R. 859. Under the Street Offences Act 1959, it was a crime for prostitutes to \"loiter or solicit in the street for the purposes of prostitution\". The defendants were calling to men in the street from balconies and tapping on windows. They claimed they were not guilty as they were not \"in the street\". The judge applied the mischief rule to conclude that they were guilty as the intention of the act was to cover the mischief of harassment from prostitutes.\n\nThe rule was first set out in \"Heydon's Case\" [1584] 76 ER 637 3 CO REP 7a, where the court held that four points should be taken into consideration:\n\nIn the century in which it was created, and for some time thereafter, the mischief rule was used in a legislative environment very different from the one which has prevailed in the past two centuries. As Elmer Driedger notes, Sixteenth-century common law judges looked upon statutes as a gloss upon the common law, even as an intrusion into their domain. Hence, statutes were viewed from the point of view of their effect upon the common law, as adding to it, subtracting from it or patching it up. Then also, in the time of \"Heydon's Case\", the judges paid more attention to the \"spirit\" of the law than to the letter. Having found the mischief they proceeded to make mischief with the words of the statute. They remodelled the statute, by taking things out and putting things in, in order to fit the \"mischief\" and \"defect\" as they had found them.\n\nModern courts apply the rule in a more restricted manner, and generally with a greater regard for the integrity of the statutes which they are interpreting. Driedger puts it this way: \"[T]o this day, \"Heydon's Case\" is frequently cited. The courts still look for the 'mischief' and 'remedy', but now use what they find as aids to discover the meaning of what the legislature has said rather than to change it\". Driedger goes on to argue that this modern use of the mischief rule ought to be understood as one of the components of what he characterized as the \"modern\" method of statutory construction, rather than a stand-alone rule serving (as it formerly had), as an alternative to the methods of construction proposed by the plain meaning rule and the golden rule.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the race's other classifications, rider Djamolidine Abdoujaparov won the points classification, Richard Virenque of the team won the mountains classification, rider Marco Pantani won the youth classification for the best rider aged 26 or under in the general classification after having finished third overall, and Eros Poli of the team won the combativity classification. Festina-Lotus won the team classification, which ranked each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\n\nA total of 21 teams were invited to participate in the 1994 Tour de France. Fifteen teams were announced in May, based on their UCI ranking: Although the organisation had planned to give five additional wildcards in June, after the 1994 Giro d'Italia, it was decided to invite one extra team, and six wildcards were given. The team of Zenon Jaskuła, who had finished in third place in the 1993 Tour de France, was not selected. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Tour began with a peloton of 189 cyclists. Of these, 189 riders that started this edition of the Tour de France, a total of 117 riders made it to the finish in Paris.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\n\nInvited teams\n\nThe 1994 edition of the Tour de France began with a short prologue that navigated around the French city of Lille. There were a total of six stages that held many high mountains, while there was only one hilly stage that contained climbs of lesser degree. Eleven of the stages were primarily flat stages. The official route contained four time trials, three of which were individual and one of which was a team event.\n\nThere were two stages that began or ended outside France. Stage 4 began in the English port town of Dover and ended in Brighton. The fifth stage began and ended in the British city of Portsmouth. This was only the second time the tour has visited England, and to mark the opening of the Channel Tunnel.\n\nOf the stages that contained mountains, four contained summit finishes: stage 11 to Hautacam, stage 12 to Luz Ardiden, stage 16 to Alpe d'Huez, and stage 17 to Val Thorens. The nineteenth stage, an individual time trial, had a summit finish to Avoriaz. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Val Thorens climb on stage 17.\n\nThe 1994 edition of the Tour de France began with a brief prologue around the city of Lille. Englishman Chris Boardman set a blistering pace on the course en route to winning the stage by fifteen seconds over the second-place finisher Miguel Indurain. Stage 1 was a relatively flat stage that came down to a bunch sprint that was marred by a large crash. As the riders were sprinting to the finish line, a policeman leaned out to take a photograph causing Wilfried Nelissen to slam on his brakes and crash into the policeman while also taking out Laurent Jalabert in the process. Djamolidine Abdoujaparov ultimately won the stage while Jalabert and Nelissen were forced to drop out of the race due to the injuries they had sustained.\n\nThe Yellow Jersey switched riders multiple times through the first eight stages but in the Stage 9 individual time trial Indurain absolutely obliterated the entire field with only eight riders able to keep him within 6:00, and of those riders only Tony Rominger was able to keep Indurain within four minutes. Amazingly a young Lance Armstrong was able to hold onto a top 10 placing through Stage 10, but other than Rominger no one was in a position to threaten Indurain's lead.\n\nAs the race entered the Pyrenees in stages 11 and 12 Indurain built on his lead over Rominger who abandoned the Tour in Stage 13. As the race climbed Mont Ventoux and crossed the Alps Marco Pantani and Piotr Ugrumov began to climb through the top 10 as Richard Virenque held onto 2nd place, but Indurain's lead was secure with Virenque more than 7:00 behind.\n\nIn the final time trial in Stage 19 Ugrumov won the stage with Pantani coming in second both riders gaining considerable time on Indurain, but by the end of the day it was too little too late for both riders as Indurain's 4th consecutive Tour de France victory was all but secure as he held a commanding lead of 5:39 over the now 2nd place Ugrumov.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1994 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Eros Poli won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 12. This prize was won by Richard Virenque.\n\n\n"}

She began studying piano at age six, and was singing with bands by the time she was a teenager. After attending the University of Minnesota, MacGregor began to tour the country with various acts and caught the attention of Peter Yarrow from Peter, Paul & Mary. She soon joined Yarrow, singing backup on a solo tour, and made an appearance on his \"Love Songs\" album.\n\nSigned to Ariola Records America, MacGregor released her debut single, \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", in late 1976; it became a smash hit by February 1977. The new year saw the single top both the pop and adult contemporary charts and was certified as a gold record. In addition, it reached #3 on \"Billboard\"'s Country chart and also reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. Two further singles from the album of the same name, also written and produced by Yarrow, charted but were overwhelmed by the success of the title track.\n\nMacGregor admitted in \"The Billboard Book of Number One Hits\" by Fred Bronson that she hated her own chart-topper, chiefly because she had little sympathy for the narrator of \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", a woman who confesses to her husband that she is having an affair, but pleads with her husband to stay with her and accept the situation. MacGregor also said that the song indirectly led to the breakup of her own marriage, because her career kept her away from home so often that her relationship with her husband strained, and they decided to separate. She did acknowledge that the song was successful because it appealed to listeners who had found themselves in the situation described in the lyrics.\n\nShe released several more albums, and had three more minor chart singles (including the song \"Good Friend\" from the 1979 Bill Murray film \"Meatballs\"). \"Good Friend\" was later added to her third and eponymous final album.\n\nIn 1980, MacGregor won best song and best performance at the World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan with \"What's the Use\" which she had co-written with David Bluefield.\n\nFor the 1981 Japanese anime film \"Adieu Galaxy Express 999\", MacGregor wrote and performed two songs. They were \"Sayonara\" and \"Love Light\".\n\nIn 1983, Mike Love (of The Beach Boys) and MacGregor performed \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" from \"Scrooge's Rock N Roll Christmas\".\n\nIn the mid-1980s, MacGregor performed in nightclubs around the Central Coast of California with Mary and the Blue Jays, a trio composed of MacGregor, James Royce on bass, and Jim Kennedy on guitar.\n\nIn 1999, she teamed up with fellow musician friends, Joe Ghiglia and John Holt to form The Mary MacGregor Band. The result was an album called \"Perfect Yellow House\".\n\nShe is also mentioned in the liner notes of 1976's \"The Steamboat Album\" as doing vocals for one of the tracks, \"Rabbit Ears\". The album was recorded by Yampa River Records in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.\n\nShe now lives in California, has remarried, has two children and is retired.\n"}

{"id": "2281397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281397", "title": "Shell (computing)", "text": "Shell (computing)\n\nIn computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.\nCommand-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example bash).\n\nGraphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users, and are characterized as being easy to use. Since they also come with certain disadvantages, most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.\n\nOperating systems provide various services to their users, including file management, process management (running and terminating applications), batch processing, and operating system monitoring and configuration.\n\nMost operating system shells are not \"direct\" interfaces to the underlying kernel, even if a shell communicates with the user via peripheral devices attached to the computer directly. Shells are actually special applications that use the kernel API in just the same way as it is used by other application programs. A shell manages the user–system interaction by prompting users for input, interpreting their input, and then handling an output from the underlying operating system (much like a read–eval–print loop, REPL). Since the operating system shell is actually an application, it may easily be replaced with another similar application, for most operating systems.\n\nIn addition to shells running on local systems, there are different ways to make remote systems available to local users; such approaches are usually referred to as remote access or remote administration. Initially available on multi-user mainframes, which provided text-based UIs for each active user \"simultaneously\" by means of a text terminal connected to the mainframe via serial line or modem, remote access has extended to Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows. On Unix-like systems, Secure Shell protocol is usually used for text-based shells, while SSH tunneling can be used for X Window System–based graphical user interfaces (GUIs). On Microsoft Windows, Remote Desktop Protocol can be used to provide GUI remote access, and since Windows Vista, PowerShell Remote can be used for text-based remote access via WMI, RPC, and WS-Management.\n\nMost operating system shells fall into one of two categories command-line and graphical. Command line shells provide a command-line interface (CLI) to the operating system, while graphical shells provide a graphical user interface (GUI). Other possibilities, although not so common, include voice user interface and various implementations of a text-based user interface (TUI) that are not CLI. The relative merits of CLI- and GUI-based shells are often debated.\n\nA command-line interface (CLI) is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system, interactively. For example, a teletypewriter can send codes representing keystrokes to a command interpreter program running on the computer; the command interpreter parses the sequence of keystrokes and responds with an error message if it cannot recognize the sequence of characters, or it may carry out some other program action such as loading an application program, listing files, logging in a user and many others. Operating systems such as UNIX have a large variety of shell programs with different commands, syntax and capabilities, with the POSIX shell being a baseline. Some operating systems had only a single style of command interface; commodity operating systems such as MS-DOS came with a standard command interface (COMMAND.COM) but third-party interfaces were also often available, providing additional features or functions such as menuing or remote program execution.\n\nApplication programs may also implement a command-line interface. For example, in Unix-like systems, the telnet program has a number of commands for controlling a link to a remote computer system. Since the commands to the program are made of the same keystrokes as the data being sent to a remote computer, some means of distinguishing the two are required. An escape sequence can be defined, using either a special local keystroke that is never passed on but always interpreted by the local system. The program becomes modal, switching between interpreting commands from the keyboard or passing keystrokes on as data to be processed.\n\nA feature of many command-line shells is the ability to save sequences of commands for re-use. A data file can contain sequences of commands which the CLI can be made to follow as if typed in by a user. Special features in the CLI may apply when it is carrying out these stored instructions. Such batch files (script files) can be used repeatedly to automate routine operations such as initializing a set of programs when a system is restarted. Batch mode use of shells usually involves structures, conditionals, variables, and other elements of programming languages; some have the bare essentials needed for such a purpose, others are very sophisticated programming languages in and of themselves. Conversely, some programming languages can be used interactively from an operating system shell or in a purpose-built program.\n\nThe command-line shell may offer features such as command-line completion, where the interpreter expands commands based on a few characters input by the user. A command-line interpreter may offer a history function, so that the user can recall earlier commands issued to the system and repeat them, possibly with some editing. Since all commands to the operating system had to be typed by the user, short command names and compact systems for representing program options were common. Short names were sometimes hard for a user to recall, and early systems lacked the storage resources to provide a detailed on-line user instruction guide.\n\nA graphical user interface (GUI) provides means for manipulating programs graphically, by allowing for operations such as opening, closing, moving and resizing windows, as well as switching focus between windows. Graphical shells may be included with desktop environments or come separately, even as a set of loosely coupled utilities.\n\nMost graphical user interfaces develop the metaphor of an \"electronic desktop\", where data files are represented as if they were paper documents on a desk, and application programs similarly have graphical representations instead of being invoked by command names.\n\nGraphical shells typically build on top of a windowing system. In the case of X Window System or Wayland, the shell consists of an X window manager or a Wayland compositor, respectively, as well as of one or multiple programs providing the functionality to start installed applications, to manage open windows and virtual desktops, and often to support a widget engine.\n\nIn the case of macOS, Quartz could be thought of as the windowing system, and the shell consists of the Finder, the Dock, SystemUIServer, and Mission Control.\n\nModern versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system use the Windows shell as their shell. Windows Shell provides the familiar desktop environment, start menu, and task bar, as well as a graphical user interface for accessing the file management functions of the operating system. Older versions also include Program Manager, which was the shell for the 3.x series of Microsoft Windows, and which in fact shipped with later versions of Windows of both the 95 and NT types at least through Windows XP. The interfaces of Windows versions 1 and 2 were markedly different.\n\nDesktop applications are also considered shells, as long as they use a third-party engine. Likewise, many individuals and developers dissatisfied with the interface of Windows Explorer have developed software that either alters the functioning and appearance of the shell or replaces it entirely. WindowBlinds by StarDock is a good example of the former sort of application. LiteStep and Emerge Desktop are good examples of the latter.\n\nInteroperability programmes and purpose-designed software lets Windows users use equivalents of many of the various Unix-based GUIs discussed below, as well as Macintosh. An equivalent of the OS/2 Presentation Manager for version 3.0 can run some OS/2 programmes under some conditions using the OS/2 environmental subsystem in versions of Windows NT.\n\n\"Shell\" is also used loosely to describe application software that is \"built around\" a particular component, such as web browsers and email clients, in analogy to the shells found in nature. These are also sometimes referred to as \"wrappers\".\n\nIn expert systems, a shell is a piece of software that is an \"empty\" expert system without the knowledge base for any particular application.\n"}

It is sung to Frédéric Chopin's \"Heroic Polonaise\", and documents the career of British statesman Oliver Cromwell, from his service as Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon to his installation as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England.

Data is stored in in-memory multidimensional OLAP cubes, generally at the \"leaf\" level, and consolidated on demand. In addition to data, cubes can include encoded rules which define any on-demand calculations. By design, computations (typically aggregation along dimensional hierarchies using weighted summation) on the data are performed in near real-time, without the need to precalculate, due to a highly performant database design and calculation engine. These properties also allow the data to be updated frequently and by multiple users.\n\nTM1 is an example of a class of software products which implement the principles of the functional database model. The IBM Planning Analytics platform, in addition to the TM1 database server, includes an ETL tool, server management and monitoring tools and a number of user front ends which provide capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements, including workflow, adjustments, commentary, etc.\n\nThe vendor currently offers the software both as a standalone on-premise product and in the SaaS model on the cloud.\n\nWhile working at Exxon, Lilly Whaley suggested developing a planning system using the IBM mainframe time sharing option (TSO) to replace the previous IMS based planning system and thereby significantly reduce running costs. Manuel \"Manny\" Perez, who had been in IT for most of his career, took it upon himself to develop a prototype. Right away he realized that in order to provide the multidimensionality and interactivity necessary it would be necessary to keep the data structures in computer memory rather than on disk. \n\nThe business potential of the planning system Perez had developed became apparent to him and he began to explore the possibilities of commercializing it. Back in early 1981, the IBM personal computer had not yet been announced and the Apple II® was not in significant use at corporations, so initially, Perez looked to implement on a public mainframe timesharing system. Just in time, the IBM personal computer was announced. It provided a low cost development environment which Manny was quick to take advantage of.\n\nWhen Visicalc was released, Perez became convinced that it was the ideal user interface for his visionary product: the Functional Database. With his friend Jose Sinai formed the Sinper Corporation in early 1983 and released his initial product, TM/1 (the \"TM\" in TM1 stands for \"Table Manager\"). Sinper was purchased by Applix in 1996, which was purchased by Cognos in late 2007, which was in itself acquired mere months later by IBM.\n\nWith its flagship TM1 product line, Applix was the purest OLAP vendor among publicly traded independent BI vendors prior to OLAP industry consolidation in 2007, and had the greatest growth rate.\n\nOn December 16, 2016 IBM released a rebranded and expanded version of the software (IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 'powered by' IBM TM1) with a 'restarted' version numbering. The data server component is still referred to as TM1 and retains numbering continued from prior versions, so Planning Analytics version 2.x includes TM1 version 11.x.\n\n\n\n"}

CD34 was first described on hematopoietic stem cells independently by Civin et al. and Tindle et al. as a cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a cell-cell adhesion factor. It may also mediate the attachment of hematopoietic stem cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. Clinically, it is associated with the selection and enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow transplants. Due to these historical and clinical associations, CD34 expression is almost ubiquitously related to hematopoietic cells however it is actually found on many other cell types as well.\n\nThe CD34 protein is a member of a family of single-pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular-associated tissue. However, little is known about its exact function.\n\nCD34 is also an important adhesion molecule and is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on lymph node endothelia, whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on the T cell. Conversely, under other circumstances CD34 has been shown to act as molecular \"Teflon\" and block mast cell, eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion, and to facilitate opening of vascular lumina. Finally, recent data suggest CD34 may also play a more selective role in chemokine-dependent migration of eosinophils and dendritic cell precursors. Regardless of its mode of action, under all circumstances CD34, and its relatives podocalyxin and endoglycan, facilitates cell migration.\n\nCells expressing CD34 (CD34 cell) are normally found in the umbilical cord and bone marrow as hematopoietic cells, or in mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, endothelial cells of blood vessels but not lymphatics (except pleural lymphatics), mast cells, a sub-population of dendritic cells (which are factor XIIIa-negative) in the interstitium and around the adnexa of dermis of skin, as well as cells in soft tissue tumors like DFSP, GIST, SFT, HPC, and to some degree in MPNSTs, etc. The presence of CD34 on non-hematopoietic cells in various tissues has been linked to progenitor and adult stem cell phenotypes.\n\nIt is important to mention that Long-Term Hematopoietic Stem Cells (LT-HSCs) in mice and humans are the hematopoietic cells with the greatest self-renewal capacity. Human HSCs express the CD34 marker.\n\nCD34 is expressed in roughly 20% of murine hematopoietic stem cells, and can be stimulated and reversed.\n\nCD34+ is often used clinically to quantify the number of haemopoietic stem cells for use in haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. This is generally a useful marker for cell dosing although there is some evidence that the CD34+ quantification may not be reliable in some circumstances. CD34+ cells may be isolated from blood samples using immunomagnetic and used for CD34+ transplants, which have lower rates of graft versus host disease.\n\nAntibodies are used to quantify and purify hematopoietic progenitor stem cells for research and for clinical bone marrow transplantation. However, counting CD34+ mononuclear cells may overestimate myeloid blasts in bone marrow smears due to hematogones (B lymphocyte precursors) and CD34+ megakaryocytes.\n\nCells observed as CD34+ and CD38- are of an undifferentiated, primitive form; i.e., they are multipotential hemopoietic stem cells. Thus, because of their CD34+ expression, such undifferentiated cells can be sorted out.\n\nIn tumors, CD34 is found in alveolar soft part sarcoma, preB-ALL (positive in 75%), AML (40%), AML-M7 (most), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, giant cell fibroblastoma, granulocytic sarcoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, meningeal hemangiopericytomas, meningiomas, neurofibromas, schwannomas, and papillary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nA negative CD34 may exclude Ewing's sarcoma/PNET, myofibrosarcoma of the breast, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors of the stomach.\n\nInjection of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells has been clinically applied to treat various diseases including spinal cord injury, liver cirrhosis and peripheral vascular disease.\n\nCD34 has been shown to interact with CRKL. It also interacts with L-selectin, important in inflammation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281420", "title": "Great Canadian Flag Debate", "text": "Great Canadian Flag Debate\n\nThe Great Canadian Flag Debate (or Great Flag Debate) was a national debate that took place in 1963 and 1964 when a new design for the national flag of Canada was chosen.\n\nAlthough the flag debate had been going on for a long time prior, it officially began on June 15, 1964, when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson proposed his plans for a new flag in the House of Commons. The debate lasted more than six months, bitterly dividing the people in the process. The debate over the proposed new Canadian flag was ended by closure on December 15, 1964. It resulted in the adoption of the \"Maple Leaf\" as the Canadian national flag.\n\nThe flag was inaugurated on February 15, 1965, and since 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as National Flag of Canada Day.\n\nFor much of its post-Confederation history, Canada used both the Royal Union Flag (Union Jack) as its national flag, and the Canadian Red Ensign as a popularly recognized and distinctive Canadian flag.\n\nThe first Canadian Red Ensigns were used in Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald's time. The Governor General at the time of Macdonald's death, Lord Stanley, wrote to London in 1891:\n\n... the Dominion Government has encouraged by precept and example the use on all public buildings throughout the provinces of the Red Ensign with the Canadian badge on the fly... [which] has come to be considered as the recognized flag of the Dominion, both ashore and afloat.\n\nUnder pressure from pro-imperial public opinion, Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier raised the Union Flag over Parliament, where it remained until the re-emergence of the Red Ensign in the 1920s. In 1945, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, having flown the Union Jack over Parliament throughout the war, made the Canadian Red Ensign the official Canadian flag by Order in Council. Mackenzie King also tried to give Canada a new flag. The recommendation that came back was a Red Ensign, but substituting the coat of arms of Canada with a gold maple leaf. Mackenzie King stopped the venture.\n\nIn 1958, an extensive poll was taken of the attitudes that adult Canadians held toward the flag. Of those who expressed opinions, over 80% wanted a national flag entirely different from that of any other nation, and 60% wanted their flag to bear the maple leaf.\n\nFrom his office as leader of the opposition, Lester Pearson issued a press release on January 27, 1960, in which he summarized the problem and presented his suggestion as:\n\n... Canadian Government taking full responsibility as soon as possible for finding a solution to the flag problem, by submitting to Parliament a measure which, if accepted by the representatives of the people in Parliament, would, I hope, settle the problem.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative government of the time, headed by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, did not accept the invitation to establish a new Canadian flag, so Pearson made it Liberal Party policy in 1961, and part of the party's election platform in the 1962 and 1963 federal elections. During the election campaign of 1963, Pearson promised that Canada would have a new flag within two years of his election. No previous party leader had ever gone as far as Pearson did, by putting a time limit on finding a new national flag for Canada. The 1963 election brought the Liberals back to power, but with a minority government. In February 1964, a three-leaf design was leaked to the press.\n\nAt the 20th Royal Canadian Legion Convention in Winnipeg on May 17, 1964, Pearson faced an unsympathetic audience of Canadian Legionnaires and told them that the time had come to replace the Canadian Red Ensign with a distinctive maple leaf flag. The Royal Canadian Legion and the Canadian Corps Association wanted to make sure that the new flag would include the Union Flag as a sign of Canadian ties to the United Kingdom and to other Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, that use the Union Flag in the quarter of their national flag.\n\nLester Pearson's preferred choice for a new flag was nicknamed \"the Pearson Pennant\". Pearson’s first design featured the three maple leaves on a white background, with vertical blue bars to either side. Pearson preferred this choice, as the blue bars reflected Canada's motto, \"From Sea to Sea\".\n\nOn June 15, 1964, Pearson opened the parliamentary flag debate with a resolution:\n\nPearson sought to produce a flag which embodied history and tradition, but he also wanted to excise the Union Jack as a reminder of Canada's heritage and links to the United Kingdom. Hence, the issue was not whether the maple leaf was pre-eminently Canadian, but rather whether the nation should exclude the British-related component from its identity.\n\nDiefenbaker led the opposition to the Maple Leaf flag, arguing for the retention of the Canadian Red Ensign. Diefenbaker and his lieutenants mounted a filibuster. The seemingly endless debate raged on in Parliament and the press with no side giving quarter. Pearson forced members of Parliament to stay over the summer, but that did not help.\n\nOn September 10, 1964, the Prime Minister yielded to the suggestion that the matter be referred to a special flag committee. The key member of the 15-person panel, Liberal Member of Parliament John Matheson said that they \"were asked to produce a flag for Canada and in six weeks!\"\n\nOn September 10, 1964, a committee of 15 Members of Parliament was announced. It was made up of seven Liberals, five Conservatives (PC) and one each from the New Democratic Party (NDP), the Social Credit Party and the Ralliement créditiste.\n\nThe Committee members were as follows:\n\nThe Conservatives at first saw this event as a victory, for they knew that all previous flag committees had suffered miscarriages. During the next six weeks the committee held 35 lengthy meetings. Thousands of suggestions also poured in from a public engaged in what had become a great Canadian debate about identity and how best to represent it.\n\n3,541 entries were submitted: many contained common elements:\n\n\nAt the last minute, John Matheson slipped a flag designed by historian George Stanley into the mix. The idea came to him while standing in front of the Mackenzie Building of the Royal Military College of Canada, while viewing the college flag flying in the wind. Stanley submitted a March 23, 1964 formal detailed memorandum to Matheson on the history of Canada's emblems, predating Pearson's raising the issue, in which he warned that any new flag \"must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature\" and that it would be \"clearly inadvisable\" to create a flag that carried either a Union Jack or a Fleur-de-lis. The design put forward had a single red maple leaf on a white plain background, flanked by two red borders, based on the design of the flag of the Royal Military College. The voting was held on October 22, 1964, when the committee’s final contest pitted Pearson’s pennant against Stanley’s. Assuming that the Liberals would vote for the Prime Minister’s design, the Conservatives backed Stanley. They were outmaneuvered by the Liberals who had agreed with others to choose the Stanley Maple Leaf flag. The Liberals voted for the red and white flag, making the selection unanimous (15–0).\n\nThe committee had made its decision, but not the House of Commons. Diefenbaker would not budge, so the debate continued for six weeks as the Conservatives launched a filibuster. The debate had become so ugly that the \"Toronto Star\" called it \"The Great Flag Farce.\"\n\nThe debate was prolonged until one of Diefenbaker's own senior members, Léon Balcer, and the Créditiste, Réal Caouette, advised the government to cut off debate by applying closure. Pearson did so, and after some 250 speeches, the final vote adopting the Stanley flag took place at 2:15 on the morning of December 15, 1964, with Balcer and the other francophone Conservatives swinging behind the Liberals. The committee's recommendation was accepted 163 to 78. At 2:00 AM, immediately after the successful vote, Matheson wrote to Stanley: \"Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag that will serve Canada well.\" Diefenbaker, however, called it \"a flag by closure, imposed by closure.\"\n\nOn the afternoon of December 15, the Commons also voted in favour of continued use of the Union Flag as a symbol of Canada's allegiance to the Crown and its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. Senate approval followed on December 17, 1964. The \"Royal Union Flag\", as it would be officially termed, would be put alongside the new flag on days of Commonwealth significance.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II approved the Maple Leaf flag by signing a royal proclamation on January 28, 1965, when both Prime Minister Pearson and Leader of the Opposition Diefenbaker were in London attending the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nThe flag was inaugurated on February 15, 1965, at an official ceremony held on Parliament Hill in Ottawa in the presence of Governor General Major-General Georges Vanier, the prime minister, the members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. Also throughout Canada, at the United Nations in New York City, and at Canadian legations and on Canadian ships throughout the world, the Canadian Red Ensign was lowered and the Maple Leaf flag was raised. As journalist George Bain wrote of the occasion, the flag \"looked bold and clean, and distinctively our own.\"\n\nAttachment to the old Canadian Red Ensign has persisted among many people, especially veterans. \n\nThe Canadian Red Ensign itself can sometimes be seen today in Canada, often in connection to veterans' associations. In addition, the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario adopted their own versions of the Red Ensign as their respective provincial flags in the wake of the national flag debate.\n\nOn the other hand, Newfoundland used the Union Flag as its provincial flag from 1952 until 1980; the blue triangles on the new flag adopted in 1980 are meant as a tribute to the Union Flag. British Columbia's flag, which features the Union Flag in its top portion, was introduced in 1960 and is actually based on the shield of the provincial coat of arms, which dates back to 1906. Hence, both Newfoundland's use of the Union Flag and the adoption of British Columbia's flag are unrelated to (and, in fact, pre-date) the great flag debate.\n\nSince 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as National Flag of Canada Day in Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281429", "title": "Colonial period of South Carolina", "text": "Colonial period of South Carolina\n\nThe history of the colonial period of South Carolina focuses on the English colonization that created one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Major settlement began after 1651 as the northern half of the British colony of Carolina attracted frontiersmen from Pennsylvania and Virginia, while the southern parts were populated by wealthy English people who set up large plantations dependent on slave labor, for the cultivation of cotton, rice, and indigo.\n\nThe colony was separated into the Province of South Carolina and the Province of North Carolina in 1712. South Carolina's capital city of Charleston became a major port for traffic on the Atlantic Ocean, and South Carolina developed indigo, rice and Sea Island cotton as commodity crop exports, making it one of the most prosperous of the colonies. A strong colonial government fought wars with the local Indians, and with Spanish imperial outposts in Florida, while fending off the threat of pirates. Birth rates were high, food was abundant, and these offset the disease environment of malaria to produce rapid population growth among whites. With the expansion of plantation agriculture, the colony imported numerous African slaves, who comprised a majority of the population by 1708. They were integral to its development.\n\nThe colony developed a system of laws and self-government and a growing commitment to Republicanism, which patriots feared was threatened by the British Empire after 1765. At the same time, men with close commercial and political ties to Great Britain tended to be Loyalists when the revolution broke out. South Carolina joined the American Revolution in 1775, but was bitterly divided between Patriots and Loyalists. The British invaded in 1780 and captured most of the state, but were finally driven out.\nAfter several expeditions and a settlement attempted in the 16th century, France and Italy had abandoned the area of present-day South Carolina. In 1629, Charles I of England granted his attorney general a charter to everything between latitudes 36 and 31. Later, in 1663, Charles II of England granted the land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. Anthony Ashley Cooper, later the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury emerged as the leader of the Lords Proprietors, and John Locke became his assistant and chief planner. The two men were chiefly responsible for developing the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina, which included the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina.\n\nThe newly created province was intended in part to serve as an English bulwark to contest lands claimed by Spanish Florida. There was a single government of the Carolinas based in Charleston until 1712, when a separate government (under the Lords Proprietors) was set up for North Carolina. In 1719, the Crown purchased the South Carolina colony from the absentee Lords Proprietors and appointed Royal Governors. By 1729, seven of the eight Lords Proprietors had sold their interests back to the Crown; the separate royal colonies of North Carolina and South Carolina were established.\n\nThroughout the Colonial Period, the Carolinas participated in numerous wars with the Spanish and the Native Americans, particularly the Yamasee, Apalachee, and Cherokee. During the Yamasee War of 1715–1717, South Carolina faced near annihilation due to Native American attacks. An indigenous alliance had formed to try to push the colonists out, in part as a reaction to their trade in Native American slaves for the nearly 50 years since 1670. The effects of the slave trade affected tribes throughout the Southeast. Estimates are that Carolinians exported 24,000-51,000 Native American slaves to markets from Boston to Barbados.\n\nThe emerging planter class used the revenues to finance the purchase of enslaved Africans and financing of indentured servants. So many Africans were imported that they comprised a majority of the population in the colony from 1708 through the American Revolution. Living and working together on large plantations, they developed what is known as the Gullah culture and creole language, maintaining many west African traditions of various cultures, while adapting to the new environment.\n\nThe Black population of the Lowcountry was dominated by wealthy planters of English descent and indentured servants from southern and western England. The interior Carolina upcountry was settled later, largely in the 18th century by Ulster Scots immigrants arriving via Pennsylvania and Virginia, German Calvinists, French Huguenot refugees in the Piedmont and foothills as well as by working class English indentured servants who moved inland after completing their terms of service working on coastal plantations. Toward the end of the Colonial Period, the upcountry people were underrepresented politically and felt they were mistreated by the planter elite. In reaction, many took a Loyalist position when the Lowcountry planters complained of the new taxes, an issue that later contributed to the colony's support of the American Revolution.\n\nIn North Carolina a short-lived colony was established near the mouth of the Cape Fear River. A ship was sent southward to explore the Port Royal, South Carolina area, where the French had established the short-lived Charlesfort post and the Spanish had built Santa Elena, the capital of Spanish Florida from 1566 to 1587, until it was abandoned. Captain Robert Sanford made a visit with the friendly Edisto Indians. When the ship departed to return to Cape Fear, Dr. Henry Woodward stayed behind to study the interior and native Indians.\n\nIn Bermuda, Colonel William Sayle, an 80-year-old Puritan Bermudian colonist, was named governor of Carolina. On March 15, 1670, under Sayle (who sailed on a Bermuda sloop with a number of Bermudian families), they finally reached Port Royal. According to the account of one passenger, the Indians were friendly, made signs toward where they should land, and spoke broken Spanish. Spain still considered Carolina to be its land; the main Spanish base, St. Augustine, was not far away. The Spanish missionary provinces of Guale and Mocama occupied the coast south of the Savannah River and Port Royal.\n\nAlthough the Edisto Indians were not happy to have the English settle permanently, the chief of the Kiawah Indians, who lived farther north along the coast, arrived to invite the English to settle among his people and protect them from the Westo tribe, slave-raiding allies of Virginia. The sailors agreed and sailed for the region now called West Ashley. When they landed in early April at Albemarle Point on the shores of the Ashley River, they founded Charles Town, named in honor of their king. On May 23, \"Three Brothers\" arrived in Charles Town Bay without 11 or 12 passengers who had gone for water and supplies at St. Catherines Island, and had run into Indians allied with the Spanish. Of the hundreds of people who had sailed from England or Barbados, only 148 people, including three African slaves, lived to arrive at Charles Town Landing.\n\nProprietary rule was unpopular in South Carolina almost from the start, mainly because propertied immigrants to the colony hoped to monopolize the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina as a basis for government. Moreover, many Anglicans resented the Proprietors' guarantee of freedom of religion to Dissenters. In November 1719, Carolina elected James Moore as governor and sent a representative to ask the King to make Carolina a royal province with a royal governor. They wanted the Crown to grant the colony aid and security directly from the English government. Because the Crown was interested in Carolina's exports and did not think the Lords Proprietor were adequately protecting the colony, it agreed. Robert Johnson, the last proprietary governor, became the first royal governor.\n\nMeanwhile, the colony of Carolina was slowly splitting in two. In the first fifty years of the colony's existence, most settlement was focused on the region around Charleston, as the northern part of the colony had no deep water port. North Carolina's earliest settlement region, the Albemarle Settlements, was colonized by Virginians and closely tied to Virginia. In 1712, the northern half of Carolina was granted its own governor and named \"North Carolina\". North Carolina remained under proprietary rule until 1729.\n\nBecause South Carolina was more populous and more commercially important, most Europeans thought primarily of it, and not of North Carolina, when they referred to \"Carolina\". By the time of the American Revolution, this colony was known as \"South Carolina.\"\n\nGovernor Robert Johnson encouraged settlement in the western frontier to make Charles Town's shipping more profitable, and to create a buffer zone against attacks. The Carolinians arranged a fund to lure European Protestants. Each family would receive free land based on the number of people that it brought over, including indentured servants and slaves. Every 100 families settling together would be declared a parish and given two representatives in the state assembly. Within ten years, eight townships formed, all along navigable streams. Charlestonians considered the towns created by the Huguenots, German Calvinists, Scots, Ulster-Scots Presbyterians, working class English laborers who were former indentured servants and Welsh farmers, such as Orangeburg and Saxe-Gotha (later called Cayce), to be their first line of defense in case of an Indian attack, and military reserves against the threat of a slave uprising. Between 1729 and 1775, twenty-nine new towns were founded in South Carolina.\n\nBy the 1750s the Piedmont region attracted numerous frontier families from the north, using the Great Wagon Road. Differences in religion, philosophy and background between the mostly subsistence farmers in the Upcountry and the slaveholding planters of the Low Country bred distrust and hostility between the two regions. The Low Country planters traditionally had wealth, education and political power. By the time of the Revolution, however, the Upcountry contained nearly half the white population of South Carolina, about 30,000 settlers. Nearly all of them were Dissenting Protestants. After the Revolution, the state legislature disestablished the Anglican Church.\n\nThe main source of wealth during the late-colonial period was the export of rice, deerskins and, by the 1760s, indigo. Sea Island cotton, produced on large plantations off the coast, was also highly profitable.\n\nAlthough Governor Francis Nicholson attempted to pacify the Cherokee with gifts, they had grown discontented with the arrangements. Sir Alexander Cuming negotiated with them to open some land for settlement in 1730. Because Governor James Glen stepped in to bring peace between the Creek people and Cherokee, who were traditional enemies, the Cherokee rewarded him by granting South Carolina a few thousand acres of land near their major Lower Town of Keowee. In 1753, the Carolinians built Fort Prince George as a British outpost and trading center near the Keowee River. Two years later Old Hop, an important Cherokee chief, made a treaty with Glen at Saluda Old Town, midway between Charles Town and Keowee. Old Hop gave the Carolinians the 96th District, a region that included parts of ten currently separate counties.\n\nFrom 1755 to 1758, Cherokee warriors served as British allies in campaigns along the Virginia and Pennsylvania frontier. Returning homeward, they were killed by Virginia frontiersmen. In 1759, the Cherokee avenged these killings and began attacking white settlers in the southern colonial Upcountry. South Carolina's Governor William Henry Lyttelton raised an army of 1,100 men and marched on the Lower Towns, which quickly agreed to peace. As part of the peace terms, two dozen Cherokee chiefs were imprisoned as hostages in Fort Prince George. Lyttelton returned to Charles Town, but the Cherokee continued raiding the frontier. In February 1760, the Cherokee attacked Fort Prince George trying to rescue the hostages. In the battle, the fort's commander was killed. His replacement quickly ordered the execution of the hostages, then fought off the Cherokee assault.\n\nUnable to put down the rebellion, Governor Lyttelton appealed to Jeffrey Amherst, who sent Archibald Montgomery with an army of 1,200 British regulars and Scots Highlanders. Montgomery's army burned a few of the Cherokees' abandoned Lower Towns. When he tried to cross into the region of the Cherokee Middle Towns, he was ambushed and defeated at \"Etchoe Pass\" and forced to return to Charles Town. In 1761, the British made a third attempt to defeat the Cherokee. General Grant led an army of 2,600 men, including Catawba scouts. The Cherokee fought at Etchoe Pass but failed to stop Grant's army. The British burned the Cherokee Middle Towns and fields of crops.\n\nIn September 1761, a number of Cherokee chiefs led by Attakullakulla petitioned for peace. The terms of the peace treaty, concluded in Charleston that December, included the cession of lands along the South Carolina frontier.\n\nAfter the Cherokee defeat and cession of land, new settlers from Ulster flooded into the Upcountry through the Waxhaws in what is now called Lancaster County. Lawlessness ensued and robbery, arson, and looting became common. Upcountry residents formed a group of \"Regulators,\" vigilantes who took the law into their own hands to control the criminals. Having acquired 50% of the state's white population, but just three elected assemblymen in the Commons House of Assembly, the Upcountry sent representative Patrick Calhoun and other representatives before the Charles Town state legislature to appeal for representation, courts, roads, and supplies for churches and schools. Before long, Calhoun and Moses Kirkland were in the legislature as Upcountry representatives.\n\nBy 1775, the colony contained 60,000 European Americans and 80,000 mostly enslaved African Americans. \nLord William Campbell was the last English Governor of the Province of South Carolina.\n\nNumerous churches built bases in Charleston, and expanded into the rural areas. From the founding of Charleston onwards, the colony welcomed many different religious groups, including Jews and Quakers, but Catholics were prohibited from practicing until after the American Revolution. Baptists and Methodists increased in number rapidly in the late 18th century as a result of the Great Awakening and its revivals, and their missionaries attracted many slaves with their inclusive congregations and recognition of blacks as preachers. The Scots-Irish in the Backcountry were Presbyterians, and the wealthy planters in the Low Country tended to be English Anglicans. The different churches recognized and supported each other, eventually building the colony into a pluralist and tolerant society. Despite official religious tolerance, tensions did exist between Anglican and 'Dissenter' factions throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.\n\nThe highly successful preaching tour of evangelist George Whitefield in 1740 ignited a religious revival—called the First Great Awakening—which energized evangelical Protestants. They expanded their membership among the white farmers, and women were especially active in the small Methodist and Baptist churches that were springing up everywhere. The evangelicals worked hard to convert the slaves to Christianity and were especially successful among black women, who had played the role of religious specialists in Africa and again in America. Slave women exercised wide-ranging spiritual leadership among Africans in America in healing and medicine, church discipline, and revival enthusiasm.\n\nMany of the rich planters came from Barbados and other islands in the Caribbean, and brought seasoned African slaves from there. The planters duplicated elements of the Caribbean economies, developing plantations for the cultivation of export crops, such as Sea Island cotton, indigo, and particularly rice. The slaves came from many diverse cultures in West Africa, where they had developed an immunity to endemic malaria, which helped them survive in the Low Country of South Carolina, where it frequently occurred. Peter Wood documents that \"Negro slaves played a significant and often determinative part in the evolution of the colony.\" They were integral to the expansion of the rice culture, and were also important in timber harvesting, as coopers, and in the production of naval stores. They were also active in the fur trade, and as boatmen, fishermen and cattle herders.\n\nBy 1708, expansion of plantation agriculture had required continuing importation of slaves from Africa and they comprised a majority of the population in the colony, a status maintained after the colonial era. On the large rice and cotton plantations, where slaves were held in large numbers with few white overseers, they gradually developed what has become known as the Gullah culture, which preserved numerous African customs and practices within adaptations to the local environment, and they developed a creole language based on West African languages and English.\n\nColonists tried to regulate the numerous slaves, including establishing dress rules to maintain differences between the classes. Relations between colonists and slaves were a result of continuing negotiation, with increasing tensions as slaves sought freedoms. In 1739, a group of slaves rose up in the Stono rebellion. Some of the leaders were from the Catholic kingdom of Kongo and appeared to be seasoned warriors; they introduced ritual practices from there and appeared to use military tactics they had learned in the Kongo. The site of the Stono Rebellion was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1974, in recognition of the slaves' bid for freedom.\n\nThe comprehensive Negro Act of 1740 was passed in South Carolina, during Governor William Bull's time in office, in response to the Stono Rebellion in 1739.

Additionally, owners were permitted to kill rebellious slaves if necessary. The Act remained in effect until 1865.\n\nSouth Carolina was struck by four major hurricanes during the colonial period.

Charles Town, the capital, was the fifth-largest city in British North America at the time. The storm was compact and powerful; the city and surrounding areas were saved from even greater destruction only because the wind shifted some three hours before high tide. The destruction resulted in a series of political effects that together substantially weakened the relationship between the royal governor and the local political elites in the Commons House Assembly: there was bickering between the various political authorities over money for rebuilding following the destruction of the colony's defenses, and the disruption caused a devastating financial crisis.

Since 1 June 2006, he has been the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nBorn in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Gurría graduated with a bachelor's degree in Economics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom and at Harvard University in the United States. \n\nBesides his native Spanish, Gurría speaks French, English, Portuguese, Italian and German.\n\nGurría served in the financial area of Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), National Development Bank (Nafinsa), Rural Development Fund, and the Office of the Mayor of Mexico City from 1968 to 1976. From 1976 to 1978, Gurría served as Mexico’s Permanent Representative to the International Coffee Organization (IFO), based in London. \n\nIn the 1980, Gurría was Mexico's lead negotiator on restructuring its foreign debt. \n\nGurría served as President and CEO of the Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext) from 1992 until 1993. \n\nGurría served as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1994–1997) in the Ernesto Zedillo administration. In this capacity, he also negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and requested financial aid during the 1994 crisis. Also, he opposed the Helms-Burton Act.\n\nAs Secretary of Finance (1998–2000), Gurría oversaw the initial years of Mexico's membership in the OECD and chaired the organization's ministerial council in 1999. Gurría is widely seen as the architect of the Mexican economic stabilization, partially by cutting government spending six times during the Zedillo administration. The effect of his work has been felt during the administration of President Vicente Fox who nominated him to lead the OECD in July 2005.. \n\nAfter leaving government office, Gurría taught International Relations and Financial Economics at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). From 2003 to 2005 he chaired the Inter-American Development Bank's External Advisory Group.\n\nIn 2005, Gurría emerged at the head of a crowded field of candidates, including former Prime Minister Marek Belka, to succeed Donald Johnston of Canada as the OECD secretary general. In the process, he underwent about 150 interviews in all member countries over the several months to win the backing of governments and OECD officials. During his initial two terms, countries such as Chile, Estonia, and Israel joined the organization. On 26 May 2015, the 34 member countries of the OECD decided to renew Gurría's mandate for the period 2016–2021. \n\nSince 2010, Gurría has been also serving as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development. He also belonged to the United Nations Secretary General’s Global Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation, chaired by former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan. \n\n\nGurría is a recipient of many honorary degrees, from the Universidad de Valle de México, Rey Juan Carlos University, European Universities of Leeds, Haifa, and Bratislava. \n\nGurría has also received several awards and decorations from more than 30 countries, including the titles of \"Grand officier de la Légion d'honneur\" and \"chevalier dans l'ordre du Mérite agricole\", awarded by the French Government. He has also received a Medal from the French Senate and the \"Ridder Grootkruis in de Orde van Orange-Naussau\" awarded by the Netherlands. Most recently, he was distinguished by the President of Korea with the \"Gwandwha\" Medal for Diplomatic Service, and also received recognition to his longstanding contribution to the development of public administration in Mexico, the \"Medalla al Mérito Administrativo Internacional\" \"Gustavo Martínez Cabanas\", awarded by the \"Instituto Nacional de Administración Pública\" (INAP). \n\nIn 2007, Gurría was the first recipient of the Globalist of the Year Award of the Canadian International Council to honour his effort as a global citizen to promote tunas-nationalism, inclusiveness and a global consciousness. His award include the Ben Gurion Leadership Award, the Award Isidro Fabela by the Mexican Association of International Studies, The \"Nueva Economía\" Award, the \"Orden Bernardo O'Higgins en el Grado de Gran Cruz\", and the \"Medalla Rectorial\" from the University of Chile. \n\nIn addition, Gurría has received the following acknowledgments:\n\nGurría is married to ophthalmologist Lulu Quintana de Gurría, who runs an eye hospital for the poor in Mexico City. They have three children.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281436", "title": "Golden rule (law)", "text": "Golden rule (law)\n\nThe golden rule in English law is one of the rules of statutory construction traditionally applied by the English courts. The rule can be used to avoid the consequences of a literal interpretation of the wording of a statute when such an interpretation would lead to a manifest absurdity or to a result that is obnoxious to principles of public policy. The rule can be applied in two different ways, named respectively the \"narrower approach\" and the \"wider approach\".\n\nIn \"Becke v Smith\" (1836) Parke, J (later Lord Wensleydale) stated:\nIt is a very useful rule in the construction of a statute, to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the words used, and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the intention of the legislature, to be collected from the statute itself, or leads to any manifest absurdity or repugnance, in which case the language may be varied or modified, to avoid such inconvenience, but no farther.\n\nTwenty years later, Lord Wensleydale restated the rule in different words in the House of Lords case \"Grey v Pearson\" (1857):\n[I]n construing wills, and indeed statutes and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but no further.\n\nThe rule may be applied in the narrower sense where there is some ambiguity or absurdity in the words themselves.\n\nIn the leading case of \"R v Allen \"(1872), the defendant was charged with bigamy under Section 57 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 which made it an offence to marry while one's spouse is still alive and not divorced. The court held that the word 'marry' could not in that context mean 'become legally married' since that could never apply to someone who is already married to someone else. To make sense of the provision, the word should be interpreted as meaning to 'go through a second ceremony of marriage'.\n\nIn its wider sense the rule may be used to avoid a result that is obnoxious to principles of public policy, even where words may prima facie carry only one meaning. \n\nThe rule was applied in this sense in \"In re Sigsworth\" (1935) in the context of the Administration of Estates Act 1925. A man had murdered his mother and then committed suicide. Under the plain terms of section 46, as the woman had died intestate her murderer stood to inherit substantially her entire estate, which would then have passed to his descendants. This was challenged by other members of the woman's family. The court used the golden rule to find in favour of the family, preventing the son's descendants as a matter of public policy from profiting from his crime. The rule as applied in that particular case has subsequently been put onto a statutory footing in the Forfeiture Act 1982 and the Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011.\n\nThe leading case on the wider approach is \"Adler v George\" (1964) in which the defendant was charged with obstructing a military guard in the execution of his duty. To succeed, the prosecution had to show that the act took place 'in the vicinity of' a military establishment. The defendant argued that 'in the vicinity' meant 'outside or in the proximity or area' of the establishment, whereas he was \"inside\" the establishment. The court decided that such an interpretation would lead to an absurd result, and interpreted 'in the vicinity of' to cover a person already on the premises.\n\n"}

{"id": "2281441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281441", "title": "Hyperoxia", "text": "Hyperoxia\n\nHyperoxia occurs when cells, tissues and organs are exposed to an excess supply of oxygen (O) or higher than normal partial pressure of oxygen.\n\nIn medicine, it refers to excess oxygen in the lungs or other body tissues, which can be caused by breathing air or oxygen at pressures greater than normal atmospheric pressure. This kind of hyperoxia can lead to oxygen toxicity, caused from the harmful effects of breathing molecular oxygen at elevated partial pressures. Hyperoxia is the opposite of hypoxia; hyperoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is excessive, and hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient.\n\nIn the environment, it refers to excess oxygen in a body of water or other habitat.\n\nAssociated with hyperoxia is an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. These oxygen containing molecules can damage lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and react with surrounding biological tissues. The human body has naturally occurring antioxidants to combat reactive molecules, but the protective antioxidant defenses can become depleted by abundant reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidation of the tissues and organs.\n\nThe symptoms produced from breathing high concentrations of oxygen for extended periods have been studied in a variety of animals, such as frogs, turtles, pigeons, mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, dogs and monkeys. The majority of these studies reported the occurrence of irritation, congestion and edema of the lungs, and even death following prolonged exposures.\n\nThe supplementation of oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity, also known as oxygen toxicity syndrome, oxygen intoxication, and oxygen poisoning. There are two main types of oxygen toxicity: central nervous system toxicity (CNS), and pulmonary and ocular toxicity.\n\nTemporary exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure can lead to central nervous system toxicity (CNS). An early but serious sign of CNS oxygen toxicity is a grand-mal seizure, also known as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure consists of a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. Signs and symptoms of oxygen toxicity are usually prevalent, but there are no standard warning signs that a seizure is about to ensue. The convulsion caused by oxygen toxicity does not lead to hypoxia, a side effect common to most seizures, because the body has an excess amount of oxygen when the convulsion begins. The seizures can lead to drowning, however, if the convulsion is suffered by a diver still in the water.\n\nProlonged exposure to higher oxygen levels at atmospheric pressure can lead to pulmonary and ocular toxicity. Symptoms of oxygen toxicity may include disorientation, respiratory problems, or myopia. Prolonged exposure to higher than normal partial pressures of oxygen can result in oxidative damage to cell membranes. Signs of pulmonary (lung) oxygen toxicity begin with slight irritation in the trachea. A mild cough usually ensues, followed by greater irritation and a worse cough until breathing becomes quite painful and the cough becomes uncontrollable. If supplementation of oxygen is continued, the individual will notice tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and if exposure is continued, fatality due to lack of oxygen.\n\nOxygen supplied at greater than atmospheric pressure has been known to damage plants, animals, and aerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli. The damaging effects vary depending on the specimen used, its age, physiological state, and diet.\n\nThe supplementation of oxygen has been a common procedure of prehospital treatment for many years. Guidelines include cautions about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These guidelines stress the use of 28% oxygen masks and caution the dangers of hyperoxia. Long-term use of supplemental oxygen improves survival in patients with COPD, but can lead to lung injury.\n\nAn additional cause of hyperoxia is related to underwater diving with breathing apparatus. Underwater divers breath a mixture of gasses which must include oxygen, and the partial pressure of any given gas mixture will increase with depth. A mixture known as nitrox is used to reduce the risk of decompression sickness by substituting oxygen for part of the nitrogen content. Breathing nitrox can lead to hyperoxia due to the high partial pressure of oxygen if used too deep or for too long. Protocols for the safe use of raised oxygen partial pressure in diving are well established and used routinely by recreational scuba divers, military combat divers and professional saturation divers alike. The highest risk of hyperoxia is in hyperbaric oxygen therapy, where it is a high probability side effect of the treatment for more serious conditions, and is considered an acceptable risk as it can be managed effectively without apparent long term effects.\n\nOxygen supplementation is used to treat tissue hypoxia and to relieve arterial hypoxemia. High concentrations of oxygen are often given to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute lung injury (ALI). Supplementing oxygen is known to cause tissue damage, with toxicity increasing with the increase of oxygen concentrations and exposure pressures. Unfortunately, the supplementation of oxygen is necessary if an individual is not able to obtain sufficient oxygen through respiration and perfusion. To decrease the chances of hyperoxia, the therapist should use the lowest concentration of oxygen required by an individual. At this time, there are no known alternatives to oxygen supplementation.\n\n"}

Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).\n\n\n"}

The film stars Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello, Jim Carrey, Ashley Judd and Oliver Platt. It omitted much of the latter half of the novel and altered the ending.\n\nThe film does not share the book's title at Irving's request; he did not believe that his novel could successfully be made into a film. The name \"Simon Birch\" was suggested by him to replace that of Owen Meany. The opening credits of the film state that it was \"suggested by\" Irving's novel. The main plot centers on 12-year-old Joe Wenteworth and his best friend Simon Birch, who was born with dwarfism.\n\nThe story begins with narration from an adult Joe (Jim Carrey) visiting the grave of Simon Birch; the rest of the movie takes place in 1964. Simon was the smallest birth in the history of Gravestown. Nobody believed that he would survive, but Simon believed he was a legitimate miracle. Simon loved baseball despite the fact that he almost never got to play, and when he did it was only to get a walk from his small strike zone. Joe's mother, Rebecca Wentworth, got pregnant in high school, the only fact anyone knows about Joe's parentage, is that Rebecca met him on a train. The fact that she refused to reveal the identity of the father has caused Joe to be a living town scandal. Simon is also obsessed with how long he can hold his breath underwater, always trying to improve this ability.\n\nOne day Rebecca invites a man she met on the train to dinner. Ben Goodrich, a drama teacher, meets Joe and Simon and brings a stuffed armadillo for Joe. Simon doesn't believe that the niceties of church are necessary. He says, in front of the congregation, that if God had made these things a priority, they were in trouble. The Sunday School teacher belittles him stating that he doesn't belong in church, and his belief that God has a special plan for him is ridiculous.\n\nOne day, while playing baseball, Simon Birch is given the perfect pitch, and hits it. It's a foul ball that hits Rebecca in the head, immediately killing her. Simon gives Joe his most prized possession, his baseball cards as an apology. Simon and Joe have an argument, with Simon claiming that everything he does is ordained. Joe disagrees saying that his mother's death was an accident. Joe's grandmother informs him that there must be a plan should she die as Rebecca never told ANYONE who Joe's father was, even in confidence. Joe decides his only hope is to find his real father.\n\nJoe and Simon believe that Joe's father may have taken the baseball. They break into the gym teacher's office to find if he has the baseball that killed Rebecca, as that would implicate him as Joe's father. It isn't there, and Joe vandalizes the office, believing that he will never find his real father. The police chief agrees to let them off, if they go to the children's retreat over their winter break. Ben picks them up from the police station and takes them for ice cream. Simon informs Ben of his destiny to be a hero, but admits that he doesn't know what that will imply. However, he fears that it could happen at any time, and he could miss it.\n\nAs the Christmas pageant arrives the children are chosen for their parts. The prettiest girl, Margerie, is chosen to play Mary; Howard is playing the angel despite his crippling fear of heights; and Simon is the baby Jesus, as he is the only one who fits in the manger. Simon agrees when he realizes that he will be able to stay next to Margerie for the entire play. Simon helps a kid not be afraid, and mentions that children listen to him because of how he looks. However the play is mostly a disaster. The turtle doves look like winged mutant turtles, the wise men cannot remember the words to \"We, Three Kings\", and Howard is so scared he forgets his lines. But when Simon assaults Margerie, after seeing her cleavage, she hits Joe, knocking the wind out of him, and Howard pukes on the stage.\n\nAs a result of the pageant, Simon is not allowed on the retreat and his baseball cards are taken away. However, he breaks into the reverend's office to get them back, inadvertently finding the fateful baseball implicating the reverend as Joe's father. Simon has Ben drive him to the retreat to inform Joe. Reverend Russell admits this to Joe at the retreat, just as Simon arrives with the baseball.\n\nWhile Simon and Joe are riding the bus home, it crashes into a lake. When the bus driver abandons the children, and the reverend is knocked unconscious, Simon takes command to get everyone out safely. With the help of Joe, he is successful getting everyone out of the bus, but Simon nearly drowns saving the last child. Joe wakes up in the hospital and visits Simon who is dying.

It has both normative and descriptive senses.\n\nNormatively, the phrase may describe the effort to suit one's rhetoric to the widest possible audience, without losing relevant information in the process.\n\nAdvocates of normative linguistic transparency often argue that linguistic opacity is dangerous to a democracy. These critics point out that jargon is deliberately employed in government and business. It encrypts morally suspect information in order to dull reaction to it: for example, the phrase \"collateral damage\" to refer to the manslaughter of innocents.\n\nOne play upon this view was by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White, who in the \"Elements of Style\" ruled that the writer ought to \"eschew obfuscation\".\n\nThe Plain Language Movement is an example of people who advocate using clearer, common language within the wider academic community.\n\nProfessor at New York University Alan Sokal, perpetrator of the Sokal hoax, is another noteworthy example of an advocate of linguistic transparency.\n\nWriter and political philosopher George Orwell was a proponent of this view, which he captured in the landmark essay, \"Politics and the English Language.\" Orwell wrote a novel, \"1984\", about a dystopian future controlled through a politically crafted language called \"Newspeak.\" Newspeak is a language that is linguistically transparent in the descriptive sense, but not in the normative one.\n\nComedian George Carlin has famously parodied the phenomenon in his stand-up comedy.\n\nThe approach may sound like common sense, but it faces the difficulty of figuring out how to communicate complex and uncommon ideas in a popular way.\n\nIn the field of lexical semantics, semantic transparency (in adjective form: semantically transparent) is a measure of the degree to which the meaning of a multimorphemic combination can be synchronically related to the meaning of its constituents. Semantic transparency is a scalar notion. At the top end of the scale are combinations whose meaning is fully transparent; at the bottom end are said to be semantically opaque (in noun form: semantic opacity).\n\nLibben proposed a four-degree analysis of bimorphemic compounds:\n\n"}

It is the main research oriented organization along with the five other academies in Ukraine specialized in various scientific disciplines. NAS Ukraine consists of numerous departments, sections, research institutes, scientific centers and various other supporting scientific organizations.\n\nThe Academy reports on the annual basis to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The presidium of the academy is located at the following address vulytsia Volodymyrska, 57, across the street from the Building of Pedagogical Museum where used to preside the Central Council during the independence period of 1917-18.\n\nIn 1919–1991 it was a republican branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.\n\nOver its history, the NAS Ukraine has had these 5 names.\n\nThe direct institutional predecessors of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences were the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lemberg (Lviv) and the Ukrainian Scientific Society in Kiev that due to various circumstances did not developed into national academy.\nThe initiative to create such an institution came from the Ukrainian Science Society in April 1917, eight months before the beginning of the Soviet-Ukrainian War. However it was finally materialized during the time of the Ukrainian State, when on the proposal of the Minister of Education and Arts Mykola Vasylenko a special commission was formed. Headed by academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Volodymyr Vernadskyi, the commission has drafted a bill about creation of the Ukrainian Academy of Science in Kiev with its National Library, National Museum, and other scientific institutions. At the end of June of 1918 the issue on creation of the Academy was raised at the Ukrainian Science Society Extraordinary General Assembly (June 23 and 28). During July 9 - September 17, 1918 the commission based on the proposed by Vernadskyi a model of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (UAS) as an academy with universal characteristics has developed a bill for the creation of the Academy, a draft of its statute and staff, estimate. Based on them on November 14, 1918 Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadsky signed the Law of Ukrainian State about establishing of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kiev, and also approved the UAS statute, the UAS staff and its institutions and the order of Ministry of National Education about appointing the first 12 full members (academicians) of the UAS.\n\nAccording to its original statute, the Academy consisted of three research departments in history and philology (1st department), physics and mathematics (2nd department), as well as social studies (3rd department). Its structural units became permanent commissions and institutes. There were planned 15 institutes, 14 permanent commissions, 6 museums, 2 offices, 2 laboratories, botanical and acclimatization gardens, astronomical observatory, biology station, printing house and national library. All publishing of academy was to be printed in the Ukrainian language. Its statute emphasized the all-Ukrainian nature: the members could be not only citizens of the Ukrainian State, but also the Ukrainian scientists of the West Ukraine (at that time citizens of Austria-Hungary). Foreigners could become academicians as well, but on the resolution of the 2/3 of the active members' composition.\nThe presidium of newly created academy and its first academicians (three to each department) were appointed by the Ukrainian government, while the future members were expected to be elected by those academicians (as an active members). Among the first academicians were historians Dmytro Bahaliy and Orest Levytsky, economists Mykhailo Tuhan-Baranovsky and Volodymyr Kosynsky, eastern studies Ahathanhel Krymsky and Nikolai Petrov, linguist Stepan Smal-Stotsky, geologists Volodymyr Vernadsky and Pavlo Tutkovsky, biologist Mykola Kashchenko, mechanic Stepan Tymoshenko, law studies Fedir Taranovsky. For the post of the President of the Academy, the Hetman of Ukraine (head of state) Pavlo Skoropadsky invited Mykhailo Hrushevsky who at that time was the president of the Ukrainian Science Society and before the World War I served as the president of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lemberg, neighboring Austria-Hungary, but Hrushevsky declined the invitation yet later (sometime after 1923) became a major figure in the Ukrainian Academy of Science (UAS) in Kyiv.\n\nIts official operations the academy started at the end of November 1918 with having several sessions of General Assembly and assemblies of its departments. The first General Assembly (Constituent) that took place on November 27, 1918 academician Volodymyr Vernadsky was elected the President of academy, while the permanent secretary became Ahathanhel Krymsky. The same day, at the sessions of the 2nd and the 3rd departments there were elected as chairmen respectively Mykola Kashchenko and Mykhailo Tuhan-Baranovsky, on 8 December 1918 the chairman of the 1st department was elected Dmytro Bahaliy. All appointments were approved by Hetman Skoropadskyi.\nThe first institutions of the UAS established in December 1918 were such commissions: \n\nNext month there were added following commissions:\n\nDuring its first years the academy operated during the period of political instability and economical ruin (Ukrainian–Soviet War, Russian Civil War, Polish–Soviet War). The leadership of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences sought its recognition by each new power and principally emphasizing on non-political background of the main science center. Despite the financial hardship, famine, arrests, and emigration of some of its members, the UAS has not only survived as an institution, but developed its structure and directions of research, began to prepare for publication its scientific works.\n\nOn 3 January 1919 the Direktoria of the Ukrainian People's Republic has adopted legislatively changes to the UAS statute, according to which there were made provisions concerning printing of works in Ukrainian and foreign languages (volume of publications in foreign language should not exceeded the 1/4 amount of the Ukrainian language), all the UAS officials had to freely possess the Ukrainian language, and full members upon their approval would swear in allegiance to the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Supreme power also has left after itself the right to approve the newly elected members at the UAS General Assembly.\nFollowing occupation of Kiev by Bolshevik forces, on 11 February 1919 to the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was handed over as its own property the mansion and former boarding house of countess Levashova on the order of People's Commissar of Education of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, Volodymyr Zatonskyi. The next day on 12 February 1919 there took place an extraordinary UAS General Assembly, during which Ahatanhel Krymsky passed on the order of Zatonskyi immediately to start the work. Since the late 1920s, in the Soviet historiography that day was considered as the day of establishing the Academy of Sciences contrary to 14 February 1918 when Hetman Skoropadskyi signed the law on creation of the academy.\n\nAfter several change of powers and withdrawal of the Denikin's forces in December 1919 the Bolsheviks permanently established themselves in Kiev. With the second arrival of Bolsheviks Vernadsky resigned. Orest Levytskyor was elected President of the Academy for the next couple of years. In 1921 Levytsky was replaced by a newly elected Mykola Vasylenko, however he was not approved by the authorities and soon was replaced with Levytsky. Vasylenko after that was arrested in 1923 and convicted (later released on amnesty).\n\nOn June 14, 1921, the Council of People's Commissars of Ukrainian SSR adopted a decree \"Resolution on the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences\", according to which the Academy was recognized as the highest scientific state institution and subordinated to the Narkom of Education. The Academy was renamed from UAS to VUAN () as the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences underlining its meaning for the Ukrainian territories under Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and declaring its intentions to unite within one organization the scientific intelligentsiya of all Ukrainian lands. The relationship between the members of VUAN and the Soviet authorities soured, while the relationships with the Ukrainian scientists abroad had completely diminished. After the historian Orest Levytsky the President of the Academy became the botanist Volodymyr Ipolytyovych Lypsky. Between 1919-1930 to the Academy were elected 103 academicians. In 1924-5, the Academy held its first election for foreign members. However, none of the candidates were approved by the Narkom of Education.\nIn 1929, two of its members (Serhiy Yefremov and Mykhailo Slabchenko) and 24 corresponding agents (such as Osip Hermaize, Hryhoriy Holoskevych, Andriy Nikovsky, and others) were arrested in accusation to belonging to the non-existing (as later it was established) \"Union for the Freedom of Ukraine\". None of the arrested have ever been released.\n\nThe NASU has had only nine (9) different presidents:\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine according to its official status is a higher scientific self-governed organization of Ukraine and was founded on a state property. The self-government of the Academy is kept in independent determination of its research's thematic and forms of its organization and realization, formation of its organizational structure, solving own issues with administration of research, its financing, and professional cadres, fulfillment of its international scientific relations, free election and collegiality of its governing authority. The Academy brings together full members, corresponding members, and its foreign members, all scientists of its institutions, organizes and conducts fundamental and applied scientific research in the most important issues of natural, technical, social, and humanitarian sciences.\n\nThe highest body of self-government of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine is its General Assembly (, Zahalni zbory) that consists of full members (academicians) and corresponding members. Except for issues relating to election of full members, corresponding members and foreign members of the Academy, at the General Assembly sessions take part with the right of decisive vote scientists who were delegated by work collective of the Academy's scientific institutions and with the right of advisory vote foreign members, directors of the Academy's scientific institutions, and representatives of scientific community.\n\nIn period between the General Assembly sessions the Academy's activities are being administered (supervised) by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Presidium which is elected by General Assembly on the term of 5 years. The NASU Presidium that was lastly elected in April of 2015 consists of 32 persons including president, 5 vice-presidents, Chief Scientific Secretary, 14 department secretaries-academicians, 11 other members. In the Presidium's sessions take part with the right of advisory vote 5 acting Presidium members and 14 NASU Presidium advisers. The presidium meets in the former building of Countess Levashova that the Academy owns since its establishment in 1918. The presidium also directs operations of the Academy's publishing institutions as well as some selected science and other institutions among which are own exposition center, Grand Conference Hall, etc.\n\nIn the NASU function 3 sections with 14 departments within them. There also are 6 regional science centers in various regions of the country, which have dual subordination also to the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. The basic elements of the NASU's structure are scientific research institutes and other scientific institutions such as observatories, botanic gardens, arboreta, nature preserves, libraries, museums, other. In 2006 the Academy accounted for 43,613 employees including 16,813 researchers; among them, 2,493 with degree of Doktor Nauk (Doctor of Sciences) and 7,996 with degree of Kandidat Nauk (Candidate of Sciences, Ph.D.).\n\nThe NASU is responsible for over 90% of all discoveries made in Ukraine, including the transmutation of lithium into helium, the production of heavy water, and the development of a 3-D radar that operates in the decimeter range.\n\n\nRegional science centers (SCs) are:\nThe most of institutions of the Academy (212) are placed in the city of Kiev, following by Kharkiv (39) and Lviv (27). The Academy is represented at least by one institution in most of the oblasts in Ukraine, except Volyn, Rivne, Ternopil, Khmelnytsky, Vinnytsia, and Kirovohrad.\n\nThere are 2 national libraries affiliated with the NASU:\n\nThe department of General Biology includes a number of parks and nature reserves.\n\nThe NASU has two publishing houses:\n\nThe NASU has made major contributions to most of the major fields of science.\n\n\nThe Bogolyubov Prize is an award offered by the Academy for scientists with outstanding contribution to theoretical physics and applied mathematics. The award is issued in the memory of theoretical physicist and mathematician Nikolay Bogolyubov.\n\nThe Academy has awarded its Vernadsky Gold Medal annually since 2004 to the most distinguished academicians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Senators elected to regular terms in 2006 completed those terms in this Congress. This Congress included the last House of Representatives elected from congressional districts that were apportioned based on the 2000 census.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party won the majority in the House of Representatives. While the Democrats kept their Senate majority, it was reduced from the previous Congress.\n\nThis was the first Congress in which the House and Senate were controlled by different parties since the 107th Congress (2001–2003), and the first Congress to begin that way since the 99th Congress (1985–1987). It was also the first Congress since the 36th Congress, over 150 years, in which the Republican Party held the House but not the Senate. In this Congress, the House of Representatives had the largest number of Republican members, 242, since the 80th Congress (1947–1949).

A one-week budget was proposed to avoid a government shutdown and allow more time for negotiations; however, proposals from both parties could not be accommodated. Obama said he would veto a proposed Republican budget over Republican social spending cuts. This was also backed by Senate Democrats who objected to such cuts as that of Planned Parenthood. However, an agreement was reached between the two parties for a one-week budget to allow for more time to negotiate after Republicans dropped their stance on the Planned Parenthood issue. The two parties ultimately agreed on a 2011 federal budget the following week.\n\nThere were many reactions to the possible shutdown with some saying the economy could be hurt during a fragile recovery and others saying the lack of an unnecessary bureaucracy would not be noticed. There was also criticism that while senators and representatives would continue to get paid others such as the police and military personnel would either not be paid for their work or have their payments deferred.\n\nOn August 2, 2011, the United States public debt was projected to reach its statutory maximum. Without an increase in that limit the U.S. Treasury would be unable to borrow money to pay its bills. Although previous statutory increases have been routine, conservative members of the House refused to allow an increase without drastically reducing government spending.

Although the annexation was successful, many Irishmen continued to show support for the Boers during the First Anglo-Boer War; especially in 1881 following the British defeat at the Battle of Majuba Hill where an Irishman Alfred Aylward served as an adviser to the Boer General Piet Joubert during the battle. When rumours of a second war with the Boers began to surface, protesters led by James Connolly took to the streets in Dublin in August 1899 and public meetings were held across Ireland in support of the Boers. Several weeks later in Dublin a crowd of nearly twenty thousand marched in protests against the planned invasion of the South African Republic.\n\nHowever, the reality of war followed from President Kruger's ultimatum of 9 October 1899, in which he gave the British government 48 hours to comply, and when they did not he declared war on Britain on 11 October. \n\nThe Irish Transvaal Brigade was established days before the outbreak of the 2nd Anglo-Boer war and initially consisted of Irishmen who worked in the Witwatersrand. These volunteers were given full citizenship and became Burghers of the Boer republics. The brigade was formed by Col.John Y.F.Blake a former officer in the U.S. Army and succeeded by John Macbride. Under the leadership of Macbride, the brigade was strengthened by volunteers travelling from Ireland via Delagoa Bay into South Africa. \n\nRecruitment of volunteers for the Boer cause were supported by representatives of the New York United Irish Societies during a time when Dutch Americans organized to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of the Boers. Fifty-eight men of the Irish American Ambulance Corps traveled from Chicago to New York City where they were welcomed as heroes for the purpose of joining the Boer war effort. In South Africa, upon their arrival in April 1900, they were welcomed by fellow Irish American John Y.F. Blake where after they removed their Red Cross arm bands and joined the Irish Transvaal Brigade. The two Irish Americans, Michael O'Hara and Edward Egan who died in battle were described as \"New Martyrs to Liberty\" by the American press.\n\nThe Irish Transvaal Brigade, also known as the Wreckers' Corps, was organised by John MacBride, who was then employed at the Band Mines. Most of the Company-strength Brigade were Irish or Irish-American miners living in the Transvaal who were willing to fight with the Boers against the British. The Brigade was bolstered during its campaign by a contingent of volunteers who came from Chicago and by a variety of Irish volunteers who travelled from America and Ireland for the purposes of joining the Brigade.\n\nIrishmen who enlisted in the British Army also fought in the Boer War, which symbolised one of many moments in Irish history in which Irishmen had divided loyalties. That ultimately led to them fighting each other.\n\nJohn MacBride wrote his own account of the Irish Transvaal Brigade, which can found in Anthony J. Jordan's edited version of the writings of MacBride.\n\nThe Brigade would come to be known as MacBride's Brigade, after their commander, John MacBride. It was operational from September 1899 to September 1900, when the brigade fought in about 20 engagements, with 18 men killed and about 70 wounded from a complement of no more than about 300 men at any one time. When it disbanded, most of the men crossed into Mozambique, which was a colony of neutral Portugal. Colonel John Y. F. Blake, a former US Army officer was the brigade's commander. When he was wounded, his second-in-command, Major John MacBride, took command.\n\nPrior to the Siege of Ladysmith, the commandos were involved in guarding the artillery under Carolus Johannes Trichardt. The brigade also provided signal service at the Battle of Modderspruit.\n\nAt the Siege of Ladysmith, they serviced the famous Boer artillery piece, called Long Tom, and they fought at the Battle of Colenso. Having worked in the gold mines, they had a well-deserved reputation as demolition experts. They delayed the British advance on Pretoria by blowing up bridges. The brigade disbanded after the Battle of Bergendal.\n\nThe brigade received letters of thanks before they left South Africa from State Secretary F. W. Reitz, Comdant-General Louis Botha and General Barend Viljoen.\n\nThe Second Irish Brigade was formed in January 1900 by former members of the Irish Transvaal Brigade. Former \"Le Journal\" correspondent Arthur Lynch was appointed as the unit's commander. The brigade consisted of 150 commandos from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Including among others Irish, Australian, Greek, German, Boer and Italian members.\n\nThe brigade remained attached to General Lukas Meyer's command in Natal, retiring to Laing's Nek after the siege of Ladysmith. The brigade fought in the rear guard, during the retreat from Ladysmith to Glencoe. The brigade was later ordered to Vereeniging but was disbanded while it was in Johannesburg. After the dissolution of the brigade, Lynch together with a small group of Irishmen joined various commandos along the Vaal River.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2281510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281510", "title": "South Africa women's national cricket team", "text": "South Africa women's national cricket team\n\nThe South Africa women's national cricket team, nicknamed the Proteas, represents South Africa in international women's cricket. One of eight teams competing in the ICC Women's Championship (the highest level of the sport), the team is organised by Cricket South Africa (CSA), a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nSouth Africa made its Test debut in 1960, against England, becoming the fourth team to play at that level (after Australia, England, and New Zealand). Because of the sporting boycott of South Africa and other factors, the team did not play any international fixtures between 1972 and 1997. South Africa returned to international competition in August 1997, in a One Day International (ODI) match against Ireland, and later in the year participated in the 1997 World Cup in India. The team has participated in every edition of the World Cup since then, and made the tournament semi-finals in 2000 and 2017. South Africa has likewise participated in every edition of the Women's World Twenty20, and made the semi-finals of the 2014 edition, played in Bangladesh.\n\nThe first report of women's cricket in South Africa is from 1888, when Harry Cadwallader, later the first secretary of South Africa Cricket Association, observed \"a number of the fair sex indulging in practice... and they showed they are possessed of not inconsiderable talent...\". The following year, students from the South African College played against 'a team of ladies', with the male students forced to bat, bowl and field left-handed, and bat using pick-handles. The women won the match by an innings. There are other references to similar conditions being placed on male competitors in matches against women at the time, a tradition carried over from England. Women's cricket was played in South Africa fairly regularly throughout the beginning of the 20th century, and in 1922, Winfred Kingswell set-up, and became the first president of, the Peninsula Girls' School Games Union. Ten years later, she helped found the Peninsula Ladies Cricket Club (PLCC), which with 30 members, played regular matches against men's sides on level terms. They played 33 matches in two seasons with limited success, winning nine of them. In 1934, the PLCC affiliated to the Women's Cricket Association in England, which governed international cricket at the time. The intention was to organise women's cricket in South Africa, and eventually send teams to play in England, Scotland and Australia. Little progress was reported, although regular women's cricket continued until the Second World War. It was revived in 1947 by a group of enthusiasts, and in 1951 Netta Rheinberg, on behalf of the Women's Cricket Association, suggested that a South Africa Women's Cricket Association be formed, and encouraged the possibility that a series of matches could be played between the two associations. The South African & Rhodesian Women's Cricket Association (SA&RWCA) was officially formed in 1952. At their annual general meeting in January 1955, the SA&RWCA accepted an invitation from the Women's Cricket Association to join an International Women's Cricket Council that, in addition to South Africa, included England, Australia and New Zealand. They also agreed that international matches would be played between the four nations. In 1959, arrangements were made for the first international women's cricket tour of South Africa, as they would play host to the English team in 1960.\n\nThe touring English side played nine tour matches in addition to the scheduled four Test matches, beginning with a one-day contest against a Western Province Combined XI. South Africa began their first women's Test match on 2 December 1960 at St George's Oval, Port Elizabeth — the same venue as used for the first men's Test match in the country in 1889 — and ended in a draw. After another draw in the second Test, England claimed victory in the third by eight wickets, and a draw in the final Test gave the touring side a 1–0 series victory. The series saw South Africa become the fourth women's Test playing nation, after England and Australia who contested the first ever women's Test match in 1934, and New Zealand who played their first women's Test in 1935.\n\nDue to South African apartheid laws, which introduced legal racial segregation to the country in 1948, no non-white (defined under the legislation as either \"black\", \"coloured\" or \"Indian\") player was eligible to play Test cricket for South Africa. In fact, overseas teams wishing to tour South Africa were also limited by these rules. These laws led to Basil D'Oliveira, a 'Cape Coloured' South African emigrating to England, where he began to play Test cricket. He was subsequently named as a late replacement as part of the England team to tour South African in 1968–69, but South African Prime Minister John Vorster refused to allow D'Oliveira into the country as part of the touring side, declaring: \"We are not prepared to receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not in the game but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide. The MCC team is not the team of the MCC but of the anti-apartheid movement.\" A week later, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) called off the tour. South Africa's cricket team toured Australia the following winter, but a tour of England in 1970, and of Australia in 1971–72 were both cancelled after anti-apartheid protests. Despite this growing sporting isolation, a New Zealand women's team toured South Africa in the 1971–72 season. Only three members of the 1960 South Africa team returned to compete against New Zealand: Jennifer Gove, Lorna Ward and Maureen Payne. New Zealand played six tour matches and three Test matches in a tour lasting just over a month spanning February and March 1972. New Zealand won the series 1–0, with both the first and the last Tests being drawn.\n\nAlthough the D'Oliveira affair had drawn international condemnation, cricket administrators in England and Australia were reluctant to sever their playing links with South Africa. Other international sports had already cut their ties with the country, exclusion from the 1964 and 1968 Olympics were followed by expulsion from the Olympic Movement in 1970. Later in the same year South African athletes were suspended from international competition by the International Amateur Athletics Federation. The invitation for the South African men's tour of England was initially maintained, but threats of physical disruption to matches from anti-apartheid militants saw the British government step-in to cancel the tour. In May 1970, the Cricket Council made the decision that there should be no further tours to and from South Africa until cricket within the country was played on a multi-racial basis, and the national team was selected purely on merit. In 1976, three different organisations; the South Africa Cricket Association (SACA), South African Board of Cricket Control (SACBOC) and the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) agreed to establish one single board to govern South African cricket, and that all future cricket in the country would be played on an integrated basis regardless of race or colour. The new governing body; the South African Cricket Union formally took over the running of cricket in the republic in September 1977. However, a group within the SACBOC did not recognise this body, and set up a rival organisation, the South African Cricket Board, led by Hassan Howa, who claimed that there could be \"no normal sport in an abnormal society\". The International Cricket Conference (ICC) imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970. Despite the official boycott, cricket tours of South Africa did continue. Derrick Robins took teams in 1973, 1974 and 1975, while an 'International Wanderers' side also toured in 1976.\n\nIn 1977, heads of state of the Commonwealth of Nations met to discuss the situation with apartheid in South Africa and the consequences of maintaining sporting ties with the country. They unanimously adopted the Gleneagles Agreement, which discouraged sporting contact and competition with organisations, teams and individuals from South Africa. This agreement temporarily stopped cricketing tours of South Africa. However, in 1982 the first of the rebel tours began. Geoffrey Boycott and Graham Gooch lead an English XI in a month-long tour of three 'Test' matches and three 'One Day Internationals'. The reaction in England and South Africa was severely polarised. The English press and politicians alike were outraged; dubbing the touring part the 'Dirty Dozen'. In South Africa, it was heralded by the government and white press as the return of international cricket. The English rebels all received three-year bans from international cricket. Sri Lanka toured during the following South African summer, and were followed by a team from the West Indies, who justified their actions by claiming they were showing white South Africa that black men were their equals. However, they received life-bans from Caribbean cricket in 1983, and were ostracised in their own countries. An Australian XI, led by former Test captain Kim Hughes toured twice in 1985/86 and 1986/87, while a second English XI, this time led by Mike Gatting represented the final rebel tour in 1990. There were some women's rebel tours from England, although these attracted much less interest than those in the men's game. Kim Price, who captained South African women between 1997 and 2000 following their return to international cricket, made her first appearances in the mid-1980s against these rebel teams.\n\nIn June 1991, the South African Cricket Union and the South African Cricket Board merged to form the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB). The unification ended enforced racial separation, and only a month later, on 10 July 1991, South Africa was re-admitted as a full member of the ICC. South Africa's men played their first match since their enforced absence in November 1991, a One Day International against India. Just under six years later, and twenty five years after their home series against New Zealand, South Africa returned to international women's cricket with a tour of Ireland and England in 1997. In addition to marking their return, the three-match women's One Day International (ODI) series against Ireland also represented South Africa's first taste of ODI cricket, as the first women's ODI had been played in 1973, during their exclusion. Despite their inexperience in the format, and the lack of international experience of their players—none of the team from the 1971–72 series remained—South Africa whitewashed Ireland 3–0. South Africa fared less well as they progressed onto the English segment of their tour. After narrowly beating England Under-23s women in a 50-over warm-up match, they fell to a 79-run loss in the first ODI. They improved in the second ODI to beat the hosts by two wickets, but a seven wicket defeat in the third, followed by rain abandonments in the final two matches saw South Africa lose the series 2–1.\n\nLater in that year, South Africa women competed in their first Women's Cricket World Cup. South Africa qualified from the group stage courtesy of their third-place finish—behind Australia and England—and met hosts India in the quarter-finals. Batting first, South Africa only managed to make 80, with Daleen Terblanche and Cindy Eksteen the sole South Africans to make a double figure score. India reached their target in 28 overs, and progressed to the semi-finals at South Africa's expense.\n\nAfter a 1998 season without any international cricket for South Africa women, they toured Australia and New Zealand in 1998–99. A three match ODI series against the world champions, Australia, resulted in a 2–0 defeat; the third match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. South Africa struggled to compete in either match, suffering a 92-run loss followed by a 100-run loss. The subsequent series in New Zealand brought further defeat; after losing both 50-over warm-up matches to New Zealand women's 'A' sides, South Africa were whitewashed in the ODI series, only managing scores of 82, 101 and 96 when batting.\n\nSouth Africa were again on tour in 2000, returning once more to England, this time contesting a five-match ODI series. Two warm-up matches against England women 'A' resulted in a narrow victory followed by a tie, not an auspicious start. However, unlike their previous two ODI series, South Africa managed to win two matches, winning both the third and the fifth ODIs. Despite these victories England won the series 3–2, subjecting South Africa to their fourth straight series defeat.\n\nThe 2000 Women's World Cup saw an improvement in form, as South Africa finished ahead of England in the group stage, courtesy of a five-wicket victory over them. Their finish saw them qualify for the semi-finals, where they were beaten by Australia, who had remained undefeated in the group stage of the competition. The achievement of South Africa's women raised publicity of the sport in their own country, where South African Women's Cricket Association president Colleen Roberts described the exposure of the women's game as \"pathetic\". Roberts explained that one of the main problems surrounding the promotion of the sport was the lack of teams touring South Africa, due to women's cricket in the country having no sponsor. South Africa did manage to attract a team to tour in 2001–02, with India travelling to the country to contest four ODIs and a Test match. After winning the ODI series 2–1, South Africa were defeated by 10 wickets in their first Test since their readmittance to international cricket.\n\nSouth Africa then played three consecutive series against England women, touring the country in 2003, and then hosting series in both 2003–04 and 2004–05. The 2003 series saw the two nations compete in two Test matches in addition to three ODIs. After a series of tour matches against county and representative sides in which South Africa mustered only one win in four attempts, the first Test match was drawn. The ODI series was scheduled before the second Test, and South Africa won the second of the limited over contests, but suffered big defeats in both of the matches either side. The tour finished with another heavy loss in the second Test, England winning by an innings and 96 runs as South Africa only managed to score 130 and 229. In 2003–04, South Africa began the series with a final-ball victory in the first ODI, but lost all the remaining ODIs to lose the series 4–1. In 2004–05 the sides played two ODIs in the weeks leading up to the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup which was being held in South Africa, two years after they had hosted the men's competition. South Africa lost both matches, and went on to have an unsuccessful tournament; in seven matches (of which one was abandoned and one had no result) South Africa only managed one victory; against West Indies. They finished the World Cup in seventh, and were eliminated. Following their elimination they hastily arranged a three-match ODI series against the West Indies, who had also been knocked out of the competition.\n\nPakistan toured South Africa in 2007, a series that South Africa won 4–0, with no result. They then toured England and Netherlands. They won all their matches in the 2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, beating Pakistan by 8 wickets in the final, and securing their place in the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup.\n\nBefore 1952, women's cricket in South Africa was for the most part ungoverned. In 1952, following advice from the Women's Cricket Association, the South Africa & Rhodesian Women's Cricket Association (SA&RWCA) was formed to administrate and organise the running of women's cricket in the country. During the years of isolation in the 1970s and 1980s, women's cricket was strong in South Africa, but with a lack of international competition, the game and governing body became defunct. The game was rejuvenated by the United Cricket Board of South Africa in 1995, when they ran a successful Women's/Girls' Tournament, and the South Africa Women's Cricket Association was formed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lists all the players who have played for South Africa in the past year, and all the formats they have played in during their international career. \n\nDespite being the oldest, and originally only, form of cricket played by women internationally, South Africa have played just twelve Test matches (half of them against England), with the most recent Test being played against India in 2014. Twenty20 cricket has taken on a far more prominent and lucrative role, almost eliminating Test cricket from the women's game altogether.\n\nResult summary\n\nResult summary\n\nResult summary\n\n\" Included a hat-trick.\"\n\n\n"}

Around the same time (1934), the first women's Test was played between England and Australia. However, women's cricket arrived in India much later; the Women's Cricket Association of India was formed in 1973. The Indian women's team played their first Test match in 1976, against the West Indies.

The studios are located in the College of Communication on the campus of Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. WGLS-FM is Gloucester County's only FM radio station.\n\nWGLS's programming features a variety of music, sports, cultural, educational programs focused towards the interest of the Rowan University and South Jersey communities.\n\nThe call letters for WGLS hearken back to the former name of the institution: W GLassboro State College.\n\nThe station has won numerous local and national awards, including being named \"College Station of the Year\" by the National Association of College Broadcasters in 1997.\n\nGlassboro State College was granted a construction permit by the FCC to build a low watt FM radio station on the campus on May 17, 1963 and a broadcast license was issued the following year on April 9, 1964. 89.7 WGLS-FM went on the air with funding provided by the college's Library Department. The library's Educational Media Director William McCavitt served as the first faculty supervisor of the 10-watt mono radio station until 1966. He left Glassboro State and went on to establish two more college stations, WIUP-FM for Indiana University of Pennsylvania and WCUC-FM at Clarion University located in Clarion, Pennsylvania.\n\nOther faculty members continued to advise the students of WGLS, including 1967 supervisor George Reinfeld, who would eventually help establish the college's Department of Communication. Joe Salviuolo was the station's advisor in 1968, but ultimately left academia to become a songwriter, producer and manager. Under the stage name \"Sal Joseph\", he collaborated with popular folk artist Jim Croce on the hit, \"Thursday\". Dr. Gregory Potter, from the GSC Library Department, took over management of WGLS in 1969, and successfully led the effort to update the college's radio studio in the campus’ Bole Hall building, as well as correcting various engineering and transmission issues.\n\nBy 1970, the school's Library Department relinquished control of WGLS to the Department of Fine and Performing Arts. Dean Armand Vorce and advisor Bob Blake kept WGLS broadcasting until 1973, when it was decided that the radio station's broadcast license would be released back to the FCC due to management and operational concerns. Student Station Manager Jim Servino successfully petitioned Glassboro State's then president Dr. Mark Chamberlain to keep the license, and to allow the students to manage WGLS on their own.\n\nServino and students enlisted the help of Communications professor Mike Donovan to help consult the radio station. WGLS then lobbied for an estimated $70,000 in funding from the school's Student Government Association for technical upgrades. The station moved across campus to Savitz Library, a new 50-foot tower was erected, and the transmitter power increased from 10 watts to 440 watts. By 1977, WGLS moved to larger studio space within Savitz Library and began to broadcast in stereo.\n\nFollowing the tenure of station advisors Mike Donovan (1973 to 1988) and Phylis Johnson (1988 to 1990), the college decided that a dedicated full-time Station Manager was needed in order for WGLS-FM to grow. Former WFIL-AM broadcaster Frank Hogan assumed the newly created role in 1991. At the time, Hogan was serving Glassboro State College as a ¾ time radio professor, having previously worked as the engineering consultant on the station's 1977 stereo and studio upgrades.\n\nWith the 1992 name change of Glassboro State College to Rowan University due to a $100 million donation from industrialist Henry Rowan, WGLS-FM re-branded itself as \"Rowan Radio\". The station's antenna moved to the Glassboro city water tower in 1993, and the increased height boosted the station's power to an effective radiated power of 640 watts. In 1995, Rowan Radio 89.7 WGLS-FM evolved from a student radio club into a permanently incorporated aspect of the newly created College of Communication and Creative Arts. WGLS-FM moved again into its fourth studio home on campus inside the then recently expanded Bozorth Hall building January 1996.\n\nRowan Radio began streaming over the internet in 2000. In January 2001, the station's transmitter was relocated 9 miles off campus to a 500-foot tower in South Harrison Twp., NJ, again increasing its signal strength to an ERP of 750 watts. Sports broadcaster and college instructor Derek Jones succeeded Frank Hogan upon his retirement in 2012.\n\nRowan Radio 89.7 WGLS-FM since its inception in 1964 has maintained a \"variety\" format in its programming choices, which reflect FCC guidelines regarding the need for licensed radio stations to operate in the public interest and serve their communities. The mixed variety format also allows WGLS’ student broadcasters to experience all kinds of radio programming as part of their studies.\n\nWGLS-FM's broadcast schedule employs the theories of \"horizontal programming\" and \"dayparting\". Implemented by station manager Frank Hogan in 1991, Rowan Radio's programming schedule consists of daily music and talk shows airing at the same time weekdays with specialized niche programming on the weekends. Regular programming is sometimes pre-empted for the station's seasonal coverage of Rowan University Division III athletic games.\n\nRowan Radio's current weekday programming schedule includes:\n\n\nWeekend Programming consists of more niche programming selections highlighting music from genres such as Broadway, Classical, Oldies, and Metal. Weekend shows include \"The 80s Arcade\", \"The Icon Rock Show\", \"Satin Nights\", \"Saturday Night At The Oldies\", \"Sunday Sounds Of Music\", \"The Sunday Matinee\" and more.\n\nPublic Affairs programming is produced by university students, instructors and civic leaders discussing a variety of local and national topics. Shows and podcasts include:\n\n\nSince its incorporation with Rowan University's College of Communication in 1995, 89.7 WGLS-FM has won over 300 broadcasting awards in local and national contests. WGLS won \"College Station of the Year\" in 1997 from the National Association of College Broadcasters.\n\nThe college station has won numerous accolades for its various programming including honors from the Gracie Awards, The Broadcast Education Association, The Communicator Awards, College Broadcasters, Inc., The Philadelphia Press Association and The New Jersey Broadcasters Association.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Entercom through licensee Entercom License, LLC, and broadcasts a classic hits format branded as \"94.7 The Drive\".\n\nWIAD broadcasts using HD Radio, using its HD2 subchannel to air \"Channel Q,\" Entercom's Talk/EDM service for the LGBTQ community, while the sports programming of sister station WJFK-FM is simulcast on its HD3 subchannel.\n\nOn July 6, 1948, the Federal Communications Commission granted Broadcast Management, Inc. a construction permit for a new FM station on 103.1 MHz with the WBCG-FM call sign. On October 18, 1950, the FCC reassigned the station to 106.3 MHz, modifying the construction permit. The FCC granted the station its first license on June 29, 1951.\n\nOn September 28, 1951, the station's call sign was changed to WUST-FM. The station's license was voluntarily transferred to WUST, Inc. on September 10, 1958, with an effective date of October 17, 1958.\n\nOn January 28, 1959, the FCC granted WUST, Inc. a construction permit to change the station's frequency to 94.7 MHz. The permit allowed the station to increase its effective radiated power (ERP) to 20,000 watts while decreasing the height above average terrain (HAAT) to 245 feet. The station's call sign was changed on April 5, 1960 to WJMD. The FCC granted a new license with the updated facilities on October 1, 1960. The station's license was modified by the FCC on November 30, 1960 to reflect a change in the owner's name to Atlantic Broadcasting Company.\n\nThe station aired a beautiful music format. The WJMD call sign was formed from the initials of the previous owners, the Diener brothers (Walter, Jack, Mickey and Dan).\n\nThe FCC granted Atlantic Broadcasting Company a construction permit on November 25, 1968, allowing an increase in ERP to 50,000 watts and an increase in HAAT to 301 feet (later modified to 309 feet). On January 4, 1970, the FCC granted a voluntary reassignment of the station's license to San Juan Racing Association, Inc. The FCC granted the new owners a new license for the station with the upgraded facilities on August 13, 1970, followed by another voluntary reassignment of the license to SJR Communications, Inc. effective December 31, 1970.\n\nDuring the 1970s, SJR Communications changed the station's ERP and HAAT several times. On August 16, 1973, SJR Communications filed a construction permit with the FCC to decrease the station's ERP to 24,000 watts while increasing the station's HAAT to 670 feet. The permit was modified on May 24, 1974 to 17,000 watts ERP and 776 feet HAAT. The FCC then granted a new license with these facilities on June 18, 1975. SJR Communications was granted another construction permit on November 18, 1976 to increase the station's ERP to 21,000 watts and its HAAT to 780 feet. The FCC then granted a new license following these changes on March 15, 1978.\n\nWJMD evolved into a soft adult contemporary music format with a change of call sign to WLTT in March 1982. Under this format, the station was branded as \"W-Lite\". The format would last for the next 11 years.\n\nWLTT dropped the soft adult contemporary music format on November 19, 1993, in favor of a classic rock music format branded as \"The Arrow\". A change of call sign followed to WARW to complement the change in branding to \"The Arrow\". WARW was also billed on-air as \"We Always Rock Washington.\"\n\nOn February 2, 2007, an adult album alternative (also known as \"triple A\") music format was adopted with the branding \"The Globe\". The new \"Globe\" format also featured \"green\" segments between songs or before and after commercials with environmental information. These segments are called \"The Green Scene\". The station's call sign changed to WTGB on February 15. The airstaff remained the same as WARW's, but some spots were flipped. Weasel moved from nights to mornings, displacing the Stevens & Medley morning team. Mark Stevens, who was part of Stevens & Medley, moved to nights and was eventually replaced by Albie Dee, who would later move to mornings, replacing Weasel, in November 2008, two months after WTGB flipped back to their prior classic rock format. Jerry Hoyt would then take over evenings. The February 2007 shift to Triple-A left rival classic hits station WBIG-FM as the capital's only analog station broadcasting some form of classic rock. The Globe's HD2 subchannel, then known as \"The Jam\", began broadcasting a mixture of classic rock.\n\nThe call sign appeared similar to Georgetown University's radio station, WGTB. Long time Washington radio listeners remember that station from the 1970s as a champion of the alternative rock of its time. WTGB's former DJs, Don \"Cerphe\" Colwell and Jonathan \"Weasel\" Gilbert (he left the station October, 2008), have each been involved with Washington radio for nearly 40 years, including stints for both at WHFS. When the station flipped formats, Cerphe left the air April, 2009.\n\nOn August 10, 2008, WTGB dropped the triple A format and began returning to a classic rock format. Three weeks after the change, music director and midday personality Schelby Sweeney quit the station, and was replaced by Marci Wiser, formerly of New York City sister station WXRK. The \"Globe\" name (but not the \"World Class Rock\" slogan) stayed, and WTGB-HD2 flipped to a triple A format. The format change was likely because of low ratings; the station stayed in the bottom seven for its entire life as a triple A outlet. On September 1, 2008, WTGB began using the branding 'Classic Rock 94.7 The Globe' on air. On February 14, 2009, however, the station's name would change to simply 'Classic Rock 94.7', like it was for some time while the station was still WARW. A new logo and website followed on March 9, 2009.\n\nCBS Radio announced on March 30, 2009 that 94.7 FM would be switching to an adult contemporary format at Noon on April 6, 2009 as \"94.7 Fresh FM\". It was said to have the same branding as sister stations WWFS in New York and WCFS-FM in Chicago. CBS aimed to have the new station compete with Clear Channel's Adult Contemporary WASH-FM, as well as Citadel's Hot Adult Contemporary WRQX (which has since been sold to Cumulus Media and shifted to Top 40, but would shift back to Hot AC in November 2015, and became a member station of K-Love in May 2019). The rivalry with WASH-FM was hinted at in various promotion spots using the tagline \"\"None of that WASHed up old stuff, just Fresh new music.\"\" \n\nOn December 16, 2009, WTGB became WIAD, becoming the only Fresh FM station not using \"FS\" in its call sign. KEZK-FM in St. Louis, Missouri followed suit the following year.\n\nIn September 2010, Zapoleon Media Strategies consultant Steve Davis was hired as Program Director. Davis eliminated the voice tracking of talent from outside the market and brought in a staff of live talent that included Tommy McFly from competitor WRQX. The original live lineup included Davis in mornings, market veteran Kristie McIntyre in midday and McFly in afternoons. This lineup remained in place for six months until McFly moved to mornings to create \"The Tommy Show\" with noted DC blogger Kelly Collis and former WMAL morning producer Jen Richer. Darik Kristofer from WSTR in Atlanta was brought in to replace McFly in afternoons and Taylor Shay came on board from WIHT to do nights, and was switched to the weekday midday shift (she has since left the station).\n\nMusically, the station evolved into Hot AC and was, at one time, considered one of the best in the country in the format. Ratings significantly improved with \"Fresh\" having the highest ratings in the frequency's history. WIAD quickly became consistently within the Top 5 in the station's target demos.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and the merger was consummated on the November 17.\n\nOn October 2, 2018, Entercom fired the entire airstaff except for afternoon drive host Darik Kristofer who stayed to help with the transition. The following day, Entercom announced via a webinar that the station would flip to classic hits as \"94.7 The Drive, DC's Greatest Hits\". The change took place at 5 p.m. that day. The format will focus on rock, pop, and R&B hits from the 1980s, while also extending into the 1970s and 1990s. In a press release, Entercom said that the Washington metropolitan area was the only major market without a classic hits radio station, and Entercom wanted to capitalize on that opportunity. \n\nOn June 10, 2009, the station switched the format on its HD2 subchannel from adult album alternative to progressive rock, branded as \"HFS2\". WHFS was a rock station that broadcast from November 11, 1961 to January 12, 2005 on various frequencies in the Washington area. The call sign is now on an AM station.\n\nOn August 1, 2011, \"HFS2\" was dropped from WIAD-HD2 and moved to WWMX-HD2. However, the next day, \"HFS2\" was switched back to WIAD-HD2. However, \"HFS2\" was dropped again on December 30, 2011 and replaced with a simulcast of WNEW-FM. After WNEW-FM changed formats in December 2015, WIAD-HD2 flipped to a classic hits format as \"Classic 94.7.\" In June 2019, WIAD-HD2 flipped to \"Channel Q\", an LGBTQ-oriented talk/dance music format based in Los Angeles.\n\n"}
{"id": "2281576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281576", "title": "Flight Unlimited III", "text": "Flight Unlimited III\n\nFlight Unlimited III is a 1999 flight simulator video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It allows players to pilot simulations of real-world commercial and civilian aircraft in and around Seattle, Washington. Players can fly freely or engage in \"Challenge\" missions, such as thwarting a theft or locating Bigfoot. The development team built on the general aviation gameplay of \"Flight Unlimited II\", with more detailed physics and terrain, more planes, and a real-time weather system. Roughly half of \"Flight Unlimited II\"s team returned to work on the sequel, supported by new hires.\n\nLead designer Peter James described \"Flight Unlimited III\"s development as a struggle, thanks to a lack of interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with \"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000\" and \"Fly!\", the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.\n\n\"Flight Unlimited III\" is a three-dimensional (3D) flight simulator video game, in which the player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A, and five planes first included in \"Flight Unlimited II\". Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from \"Flight Unlimited II\" may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.\n\nIn addition to the default \"Quick Flight\" mode, the player may play tutorial and \"Challenge\" missions. The game's tutorial mode features 26 lessons, which demonstrate basic and advanced flying techniques and then allow the player to perform them. Challenge missions test the player's flying ability with objectives such as locating Bigfoot, rescuing a stranded hiker, stopping a theft, or flying through hoops. Eleven Challenges are available, but the player may create more or download them from the Internet. \"Flight Unlimited III\" includes the level editor (\"FLED\") used to develop the game, which allows players to use the game's assets to create airports, AI flight paths, and edited landscapes. Players may share their creations online.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Flight Unlimited II\" in 1997, certain members of that game's team wanted to move on to \"Flight Unlimited III\", while others wanted to create the combat flight simulator game \"Flight Combat\". Looking Glass Studios chose to develop the games simultaneously: the team was split into two, both supplemented with new hires. The company then surveyed customers to determine where \"Flight Unlimited III\" should take place, among other things. In May 1998, Electronic Arts was announced as the game's publisher, as part of a multi-title marketing and distribution deal that also included \"System Shock 2\". Looking Glass's goal was to build on the foundation of \"Flight Unlimited II\" and to provide what project leader Tom Sperry called \"the true joy and sensation of flight in the most realistic environment available\". The company first displayed \"Flight Unlimited III\" at the \"MicroWINGS\" Conference in August 1998. At the show, the game was revealed to take place in and around Seattle—a choice based on fan requests and on the varied landscape and weather of Puget Sound. Looking Glass also discussed new planes, moving objects on the ground, and a real-time, physics-based weather system.\n\nFormer flight instructor Peter James, who had worked on \"Flight Unlimited II\", assumed the role of lead designer. He was largely responsible for \"Flight Unlimited III\"'s lessons, planes, and simulated flight instruments. James believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism, and he hoped to create a more accurate experience. Photographs were captured of each plane's real-world counterpart, and construction of the 3D plane models was led by artist Duncan Hsu, a former car modeler at Papyrus Design Group. The flight physics were coded by Kevin Wasserman and involve real-time calculations of force vectors, such as those acting against a plane's yaw, pitch, and roll. This system was more advanced than that of \"Flight Unlimited II\", which was also based on force calculations. The physics code was informed by \"real aircraft data\" and the personal experience of pilots, and each of the planes was flown as research for the game. Because the plane cockpits of previous \"Flight Unlimited\" games had been criticized by pilots, the team tried to make \"Flight Unlimited III\"s cockpits extremely authentic. Kemal Amarasingham recorded the planes' sound effects, which he said involved \"risking his life\" by standing near jet engines and underwings.\n\nThe game's terrain texture maps were made with satellite images rendered at four square meters per pixel, the highest resolution used in a flight simulator at that time. Artist Karen Wolff designed the terrain by combining large topographic maps into a \"mosaic\", which recreated the elevations and depressions of the Seattle area. The satellite imagery was layered over the resultant polygonal mesh. Real elevation data was also used for the eight lower-resolution Western American states outside of the Seattle area. Budget concerns and the storage limitations of the CD-ROM format prevented the team from rendering the entire United States, despite fan demand. The 3D objects that move across the terrain were created by Yoosun Cho, who used numerous photography books for inspiration. \"Flight Unlimited III\"s object editor let her set these objects to \"move once along the path, back and forth or cycle\". The weather system, co-designed by James, generates, moves, and disperses weather fronts based on real-time calculations of atmospheric conditions such as humidity and orographic lift.\n\nWhile visiting Looking Glass to cover \"Flight Unlimited III\"s development, journalist Dan Linton was impressed by the team management of Tom Sperry, producer Sandra Smith, and vice president of marketing Michael Malizola. He wrote that they employed \"suggestion and encouragement\" instead of \"demands\", and he believed that their work was in large part responsible for the game \"setting a new standard in the industry\". Peter James later accused the wider company's management of being lukewarm toward \"Flight Unlimited III\" during development, since their biggest sellers were action-oriented games like \"\". He claimed that their lack of interest turned the optimistic team into a \"grumbling group of depressed and sometimes angry [people]\". Although he, Smith, and Perry petitioned the company's managers to plan future add-ons and third-party development for the game, James felt that they were ignored. James developed concepts for a sequel in his spare time, but his ideas were shelved to wait for \"Flight Unlimited III\"s sales figures, which had to surpass those of \"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000\" for \"Flight Unlimited IV\" to be greenlit. James believed that this was \"foolish\", particularly because he felt that Electronic Arts undermarketed the game. He wrote that \"Flight Unlimited III\"'s marketing manager had \"great plans\" but that his \"hands seem[ed] tied\".\n\n\"Flight Unlimited III\"s official site was opened in March 1999, and the game was shown alongside \"Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe\" at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May. Tal Blevins of IGN wrote that the game had \"come a long way\" since he had seen it earlier in the year, and that it was almost complete, with development of the real-time weather system in its final stages. \"Full Throttle\" noted the game's \"impressive clouds\" and \"slick looking\" HUD. \"Flight Unlimited III\" was shown again at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in July, at which point beta testing was nearly complete and the game was \"90% done\", according to James. He stated that the public reaction was \"great\", which energized the team for a short time. The game went gold that August, nine months behind schedule. James wrote that the team celebrated with a small dinner party, and that \"the next few days were spent finding out how many people [were] quitting.\" He left after the game's completion to join Flightsim.com, a news and review website dedicated to flight simulators. The game was released on September 17, 1999.\n\n\"Flight Unlimited III\" was placed in direct competition with flight simulators such as \"Fly!\" and \"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000\". The game failed to capture sufficient market share and became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops. It sold roughly 20,000 copies in the United States during 1999. The game later earned a \"Silver\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Together with the costly development of \"Flight Combat\", the game's low sales used up Looking Glass's earnings from \"Thief: The Dark Project\" and \"System Shock 2\", which had helped them recover from the failures of \"British Open Championship Golf\" and \"\". These events contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. The game was, however, positively received by critics, with an aggregate review score of 88% on GameRankings.\n\nJosh Nolan of \"Computer Gaming World\" wrote, \"\"FU3\" is experience-oriented: it's user-friendly, graphically glamorous, and lots of fun.\" While he praised its visuals and air traffic control, he considered the game to be simpler than \"Flight Simulator 2000\" because of its less detailed lessons, interfaces, and flight physics. The magazine later nominated \"Flight Unlimited III\" as the 1999 \"Simulation of the Year\". Writing for \"Computer Games Magazine\", Denny Atkin stated that the use of turbulence \"really sets \"FU3\" apart from the competition\", and that the game's simulation of air traffic is \"like no other sim\". He praised its graphics and dynamic weather, and he found the flight physics solid in general but \"overly gentle\" for aerobatic maneuvers. He concluded, \"It's not only an excellent simulus of general aviation flying, ... it's even a good \"game\".\" \"PC Gamer UK\"s Dean Evans wrote that the game has \"a poetic grandeur\", as well as an \"astonishing attention to detail\" greater than that of its predecessors. He praised its flight lessons and weather, and he considered the graphics to be \"unbelievably delicious\". Evans summarized the game as \"the most breathtaking flying experience you can get for a PC.\"\n\nSimon Bradley of \"PC Zone\" wrote, \"\"FUIII\" has atmosphere in a way that \"MS Combat Flight Sim\" can't even dream of.\" He praised its graphics, flight physics, and detailed flight environment. He also complained of \"unflyably slow frame rates\" and warned that the game could not be played on older computers. Tony Lopez of GameSpot called the game's environmental modeling \"simply breathtaking\" and noted that elevations were rendered more smoothly than in \"Fly!\" or \"Microsoft Flight Simulator\". He wrote that the game's flight physics and weather simulation were superior to those of any other flight simulator and that the \"powerful, easy-to-use\" FLED editing tool could popularize the game. IGN writer Marc Saltzman commented that the game features \"absolutely stunning terrain at all altitudes, realistic weather and lighting effects, and highly-detailed planes\". Saltzman praised the accuracy of \"Flight Unlimited III\"s physics but remarked that the game's frame rate was \"noticeably slower\" than that of its rivals.\n"}

She applied for the University of Gdańsk's faculty of psychology and was accepted, but left the studies for Warsaw, where she joined the culture studies at the Warsaw University. She first appeared in the mass-media when her debut book \"Wojna polsko-ruska pod flagą biało-czerwoną\" (translated to English as either \"White and Red\" in the UK or \"Snow White and Russian Red\" in the US; literally means \"Polish-Russian War under White-Red Flag\") was published. Largely controversial, mostly because of the language seen by many as vulgar, cynical and simple, the book was praised by many intellectuals as innovative and fresh. Among the most active supporters of Masłowska were Marcin Świetlicki and Polityka weekly staff, most notably renowned writer Jerzy Pilch. A notable example of post-modernist literature, her book became a best-seller in Poland and won Masłowska several notable awards as well as general support among the critics.

{"id": "2281588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281588", "title": "Buck-Tick", "text": "Buck-Tick\n\nBuck-Tick (stylized as BUCK-TICK) is a Japanese rock band, formed in Fujioka, Gunma in 1983. The group has consisted of lead vocalist Atsushi Sakurai, lead guitarist Hisashi Imai, rhythm guitarist Hidehiko Hoshino, bassist Yutaka Higuchi and drummer Toll Yagami since 1985. The band has experimented with many different genres of music throughout their three decade career, including punk rock, industrial rock and gothic rock. Buck-Tick are commonly credited as one of the founders of the visual kei movement. They have released 21 studio albums, nearly all reaching the top ten on the charts, of which three in the late eighties and early nineties topped them.\n\nBuck-Tick was originally formed in 1983. All five of the band members lived in Gunma prefecture. Hisashi Imai originally had the idea for the band, and wanted to start despite not knowing how to play any instruments at the time. He recruited his friend, Yutaka Higuchi, and the two of them began to practice — Imai on guitar and Higuchi on bass. Then, Higuchi asked Hidehiko Hoshino, who had been his friend since their first year of high school, if he would like to join, too. Since Hoshino was tall and handsome, Higuchi tried to convince him to become the vocalist, but Hoshino was more interested in playing guitar, and did not want to be in the spotlight, so Imai's friend Araki became vocalist instead. Atsushi Sakurai, a rebellious loner in Imai's class who hung out with the bad-kid \"Yankī\" crowd, volunteered to be the drummer. The Buck-Tick members went to high school with Boøwy singer Kyosuke Himuro.\n\nImai named the band in Spring 1984. Once they had practiced enough to be able to play, they began to perform live at small, local events. They started out playing covers of songs by the famous Japanese punk band The Stalin. From the beginning, they were conscious of their image and tried to differentiate themselves from the crowd. They performed in suits with their hair up and soon added white face makeup, as well.\n\nWhen Imai graduated high school, he moved to Tokyo with Araki and enrolled in design school. When Higuchi and Hoshino graduated a year later, they also moved to Tokyo — Higuchi for business school and Hoshino for culinary school. However, they returned home on weekends to practice together and play shows. During the summer of 1984, the band changed their name to Buck-Tick, which is a creative spelling of , the Japanese word for firecracker. They also began to perform original songs, written by Imai and a few by Hoshino.\n\nSakurai's parents wouldn't let him move to Tokyo, so he was the only one left alone in Gunma, and became very depressed. He spent all his time alone, and to pass the time, he often went to concerts and watched bands live on TV, and he decided that he was sick of being a drummer and wanted to be a vocalist instead. Higuchi's brother Toll Yagami was also in a band, SP, and when SP lost their vocalist, Sakurai asked Yagami if he could be the replacement. Yagami politely refused his request, and SP broke up.\n\nHowever, at the same time, the rest of Buck-Tick was becoming frustrated with Araki. As Imai's composing skills improved, Araki became unable to carry the melodies to the songs. Though it was painful for them, the band decided to fire Araki, and Sakurai convinced them to let him take Araki's place. Buck-Tick was now missing a drummer, but the hole was soon filled by Yagami, after Higuchi convinced him that the best way for him to get over the loss of his own band was to join theirs instead. This became the final lineup for the band, and has not changed since.\n\nAfter the change in the lineup, Buck-Tick became more and more serious about music. When Sakurai's father died, he too moved to Tokyo. The five members worked during the day and practiced and performed at night. Then, in July 1986, they attracted the attention of Sawaki Kazuo, head of Taiyou Records, an independent label. He had seen the band perform at a live house called Shinjuku Attic, and had been very impressed. He claimed to have clairvoyant powers and told the band they would succeed within a year. The band signed to Taiyou Records immediately and released their first single, \"To-Search\" on October 21 of the same year.\n\nWith Sawaki's help they began promoting themselves very actively. They played the live house circuit in Tokyo and on April 1, 1987 released their first album, \"Hurry Up Mode\". In conjunction with the release, they played a live called \"Buck-Tick Phenomenon\" at the 1,200-capacity Toyoto Public Hall in Ikebukuro. Everyone in the local music scene believed the hall was too large for the band and that the concert would be doomed to failure, but Buck-Tick used a very clever advertising strategy: they pasted thousands of eye-catching, black-and-white sticker advertisements all over Tokyo's hip youth districts that read simply \"Buck-Tick Phenomenon April 1st Toyoto Public Hall\". Their staff members were nearly arrested for defacement of public property, but the strategy worked. Buck-Tick sold over half the tickets to the show, which was a huge accomplishment. They were an instant success, and major labels began vying for the chance to sign them.\n\nA number of major labels competed hotly for the honor of signing a contract with Buck-Tick. However, the band was initially unmoved by their offers. They wanted to continue pursuing music on their own terms, and they refused to sign unless the label would agree to their four stipulations: first, that the band would be able to make all their own decisions about their hair, makeup, clothing, and general image; second, that they would never be forced to change the band lineup; third, that they would never be forced to use session musicians; and last, that they would be able to do all their own production work. Most record companies balked at the idea of accepting such high demands from such a young and inexperienced group, but Takagaki Ken, of Victor Invitation Records, decided he wanted the band so badly he was willing to let them do whatever they wanted. He even offered them Victor's Aoyama studio as a place to practice.\n\nOn June 16, 1987, Buck-Tick played a show called \"Buck-Tick Phenomenon II\" at the Live Inn in Shibuya, to bid farewell to their indie days. The small venue was packed with people and the crowd grew so overexcited that the concert had to be interrupted multiple times so that the venue staff could try to get the fans to calm down. Afterward, a video of the concert called \"Buck-Tick Phenomenon Live at the Live Inn\" was released, reaching No. 4 on the Oricon video charts.\n\nOn September 3, Buck-Tick opened their personal administrative office, which they named Shaking Hands, Inc., in honor of all the musical connections they hoped to make in the future. Soon after, they embarked on their first national tour. They released their first major label album, \"Sexual XXXXX!\" on November 21, and it climbed to No. 33 on the Oricon charts, which was completely unheard of for a debut album. Tickets to their large year-end live in Tokyo at the Japan Youth Hall sold out in two days.\n\nWith success came new difficulties, though. The reporters who interviewed the band for magazines seemed to only be interested in the band's appearance, and asked questions like \"Why do you put your hair up?\", \"How long does it take you to put your hair up?\" and \"Do you put up your hair in order to attract attention so you'll sell records?\" The band members only put their hair up because they thought it looked cool. That was the only reason, they always answered, but eventually got so tired of the questions that they refused to answer them anymore. They had become popular enough that they could only play at large halls now. They missed small live houses, so they organized a secret gig under the false name \"Bluck-Tlick\" at Shinjuku Loft on January 24, 1988, and used it as an opportunity to play their older songs. They released the EP \"Romanesque\" on March 21, 1988. Their third album, \"Seventh Heaven\", followed on June 21.\n\nIn September 1988, Buck-Tick went to London to record its fourth studio album, \"Taboo\", which was produced by Owen Paul. They even played a gig there, at the Greyhound music club, and amongst those who attended were members of the band Der Zibet, who were also recording in London at the time. The members of Buck-Tick loved London, especially Sakurai, who felt that the music scene there was more welcoming of dark and serious music. Indeed, with \"Taboo\", the band broke into a darker, more serious sound which took a fair amount of criticism from members of the Japanese music scene who had previously thought of Buck-Tick as little more than idols. The album became the band's first to reach number one on the charts when it was released in January 1989.\nHowever, their first major label single \"Just One More Kiss\", became Buck-Tick's first hit in October 1988. The band made their first live television appearance performing it on the popular music program \"Music Station\". The song was also used in a series of television commercials in which the band appeared advertising Victor's CDian Stereo, with the slogan \"The super bass will firecracker.\" (a pun on Buck-Tick's name, which means \"firecracker\"). At the end of the year, Buck-Tick won \"Rookie of the Year\" at the Japan Record Awards.\n\nIn March 1989, the band started its Taboo tour. At this point they had stopped putting their hair up so much, and Sakurai had even given up on dyeing his and let it be black. The tour was scheduled to run through May, but it was cancelled abruptly when Imai was arrested for LSD possession. The incident was covered in newspapers and tabloids at the time, but since, the band has kept it very quiet. Buck-Tick went on hiatus and Imai had to appear at a court hearing, which was attended by hundreds of concerned fans and was covered on television.\n\nFans and reporters alike wondered whether Imai's arrest spelled the end for Buck-Tick, but in the fall of 1989, the band went back to the studio and recorded its fifth studio album, \"Aku no Hana\" (\"Evil Flowers\") which was named after Baudelaire's \"Les Fleurs du Mal\" (a favorite book of Sakurai's), because the album dealt with similar themes. With \"Aku no Hana\", the band went much further into the dark and gothic image they had begun to explore in \"Taboo\" and which would later become their trademark. \"Aku no Hana\" became their second consecutive number one album and remains the group's best-selling to date.\n\nBefore the album was released they played a huge concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 29 in front of 50,000 people, in order to celebrate their return. It was the largest concert the band had ever played. Since then, the band has held a large concert nearly every year at the end of December, usually at the Nippon Budokan, to celebrate the anniversary of their reunion after Imai's arrest. Since 2001, they have named the concerts \"The Day in Question\", and the shows have often been broadcast live on TV.\n\nIn 1990, the band threw themselves back into touring, and over the summer, released an album called \"Symphonic Buck-Tick in Berlin\", featuring orchestral versions of some of their songs performed by the Berlin Chamber Orchestra. In the fall, they went back to the studio to work on their sixth album, \"Kurutta Taiyou\" (\"Crazy Sun\"). They spent much more time on this album than any of their previous ones, and the difference was noticeable. The sound is much deeper and more sophisticated, using many more studio production effects than previously.\n\nIt was at this point that the direction of the band began to change subtly, as Sakurai began to write almost all of the lyrics, and exert his creative influence more. Around this time, he was married to the band's stylist, Sayuri Watanabe, but they quickly divorced (the band later got a new stylist, Mr. Takayuki Tanizaki, who is still working for them). Sakurai's mother, who he had been very close to, also died, and due to the band's busy touring schedule, he was unable to visit her before the end. In interviews, Sakurai said that the pain he felt from these events strongly influenced his lyrics, and that this was when he started writing about real emotions, rather than what he thought was cool. Subsequently, he changed the first kanji in his name from the standard character \"\" (\"sakura\") to the older version \"\", and since then has brought a continuously evolving sense of melancholy and psychological depth to the band's lyrics.\n\n\"Kurutta Taiyou\" was released on February 21, 1991. Four days later, the band performed a unique concert called \"Satellite Circuit\", which was recorded in a studio with no audience and then broadcast on television and at special concert halls around the country.\n\nIn 1992, Buck-Tick released their first compilation album, \"Koroshi no Shirabe This Is Not Greatest Hits\". As the title suggested, it wasn't a typical \"best-of\" album. Instead, the band had spent many hours in the studio re-recording (and in some cases radically changing) songs they had already released. A tour followed the album, culminating in a two-day live event called \"Climax Together\", which took place at Yokohama Arena on September 10 and 11. The event had been put together specifically to be filmed, and great care had been taken with the lighting and design—for greater dramatic effect, the stage was even set up along the long side of the hall and obscured by a gigantic scrim which was dropped partway through the set.\nOn May 21, 1993, Buck-Tick released the single \"Dress\", which was later re-released in 2005 and used as the opening theme for the \"Trinity Blood\" anime. Soon after, on June 23, Buck-Tick released their seventh studio album, \"Darker Than Darkness -Style 93-\" a loose concept album focusing on death. The album confused fans because after the last track (track 10), the CD skips and picks up at track 75, which began with strange buzzing noises and slowly evolved into another song. This technique was rare in Japan at that time, and apparently some fans tried to return their CDs to stores, claiming that they were broken. On this album, the band also began to experiment with different instruments — Hoshino played keyboards, and during live shows, Sakurai tried his hand at the saxophone. Both Sakurai and Hoshino played these instruments on the band's next album, \"Six/Nine\".\n\nReleased on May 15, 1995, \"Six/Nine\" was an even more psychological, conceptual album than \"Darker Than Darkness -Style 93-\" had been. Before the album was released, the band had another set of video concerts, featuring equally conceptual music videos for each song, directed by Hayashi Wataru. One of the songs, \"Itoshi no Rock Star\", featured Issay (Der Zibet) on backing vocals, he also appeared with the band on the tour.\n\nIn 1996, Buck-Tick broke from Shaking Hands Inc, and started their own management company, Banker Ltd., of which Toll is president, and started their new fan club, Fish Tank. On June 21, they released their ninth album, \"Cosmos\", which featured a brighter sound than was usual for the band and also electronic, cyberpunk-influenced music in such songs as \"Living on the Net\". Unfortunately, the tour for the album had to be canceled halfway through. Sakurai, while in Nepal doing a photo shoot for the band, fell seriously ill with peritonitis. When he was told how serious his condition was, he begged to be flown back to Tokyo so that if he died, he could die at home, but once back in Japan \"he felt so relieved that he was able to recover\".\n\nIn 1997, following on the heels of Sakurai's illness was more upheaval for the band as they changed labels from Victor to Mercury Music Entertainment. They played make-up shows for the concerts that had been canceled the previous year. On December 10, they released their tenth studio album, \"Sexy Stream Liner\", marking the maturation of their new cyberpunk style, which emerged in their visual image as well, with the band sporting \"tattoos\" and electronic gadgetry on their costumes. Imai began to incorporate the use of a theremin into Buck-Tick's live shows and even into their recordings, beginning with the song \"My Fuckin’ Valentine\".\n\nOn May 13, 1998, they released the single \"Gessekai\", which was used as the opening theme to the anime series \"\". Shortly after this, on the wave of the anime boom, Japanese music began to gain popularity in the West by the internet, and \"Gessekai\" became the song that first introduced Buck-Tick to many foreign fans.\nLater in 1998, and continuing in 1999, the various Buck-Tick members involved themselves in many collaborations with other artists. However, they continued to release singles as a band and contributed a cover of \"Doubt\" to \"Tribute Spirits\", an album in memory of hide who died in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Buck-Tick changed labels for a second time, leaving Mercury for BMG Funhouse. Their popularity had been growing overseas, especially in South Korea, and the band went to Korea for the first time. They were greeted enthusiastically by fans at the airport, and they held a formal interview, but did not perform live. Later, in 2001, they returned to Korea and played at the Dongducheon Rock Festival (a.k.a. \"SoYo Rock Festival\") in Seoul. It poured rain on the day of the festival and the band were drenched during their set, but nonetheless, the crowd was ecstatic.\n\nOn September 20, 2000, the band released \"One Life, One Death\", their first studio album in nearly three years, and played a tour to support the album. In addition to this, Sakurai and Imai became involved in a supergroup called Schwein, with Raymond Watts and Sascha Konietzko, which released two albums and toured Japan in August 2001.\n\nOn March 6, 2002, Buck-Tick released their twelfth studio album, \"Kyokutou I Love You\", which was initially scheduled to be released as a double album with \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\". Ultimately the two were released separately and \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" came out the following year in February. However musically, the two albums feed into each other in a continuous loop. The last track on \"Kyokutou I Love You\" is an instrumental which becomes the bottom musical layer of the first track on \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\". Likewise, the last track on \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" contains samples from the first track on \"Kyokutou I Love You\". The album title \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" is an overt reference to William Gibson's cyberpunk novel of the same name.\n\nBuck-Tick opened for Marilyn Manson when he played at Tokyo Bay NK Hall and Osaka-jo Hall in September 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Buck-Tick largely suspended activities in order for the band members to work on their individual musical projects. The only band member who did not release music during this time was Hoshino, who went on to form the band Dropz two years later in 2006. Buck-Tick did play a few shows together, including one at Yokohama Arena that was a reprise of their \"Climax Together\" shows 12 years before. The show was released on DVD as \"Akuma to Freud -Devil and Freud- Climax Together\".\n\nApril 6, 2005 saw the release of \"Juusankai wa Gekkou\" which also happened to be the band's fourteenth studio album. It was a concept album inspired by Sakurai's solo project that focused on the idea of \"Goth\", and despite the residual gothic image Buck-Tick had been cultivating for years, it was a significant departure from any of their previous work. Special care was taken with the sets and costumes for the tour. The live shows were very dramatic, and the band even hired a clown (Gaetano Totarou) and a ballerina (Becky Janik) to perform with them at some of the shows. At this time, visual kei and Gothic & Lolita had been growing significantly in popularity and with \"Juusankai wa Gekkou\", Buck-Tick gained a large number of new fans domestically and overseas who admired the gothic style.\n\nOn December 21, the tribute album \"Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-\" was released, which contains covers of their own songs performed by 13 different artists, including Kiyoharu, J, Abingdon Boys School and Rally (composed of members from Glay, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant and The Mad Capsule Markets).\n\nIn 2006, as Buck-Tick prepared to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a major-label band, they released the single \"Kagerou\", which was used as the ending theme for the \"XxxHolic\" anime.\n\nOn June 6, 2007, they released the single \"Rendezvous\", and on the same day embarked on the \"Parade Tour\", finally celebrating their anniversary and tribute album. The tour had a unique format: at each show, a different artist from the tribute album, performed with Buck-Tick. The tour culminated in a giant festival called \"Buck-Tick Fest 2007 on Parade\", which was held on September 8 at Minato Mirai in the Yokohama port. It lasted all day and featured all 13 artists off the tribute album. Each of the guest artists and Buck-Tick played a set, and as a grand finale, there was a fireworks show over the bay.\n\nSoon after this, on September 19, 2007 Buck-Tick released their fifteenth studio album, \"Tenshi no Revolver\" (\"Angel's Revolver\"). Though they continued using a few gothic elements, they discarded the use of synth for this album, the concept for which was a \"band sound\". The band held a long national tour to support the album, which lasted until December. Also in December, the Japanese cellphone company SoftBank released special-edition Buck-Tick mobile phones that had been designed by the band members.\n\nAt the end of 2008, BMG Japan was bought out by Sony Music Entertainment Japan and operated independently still as BMG until early 2009 where a company reorganization folded BMG completely into Sony. Thus causing the band to officially become a Sony Music Entertainment Japan artist, signed to the Ariola Japan subsidiary.\n\nThe band released their next album, titled \"Memento Mori\", on February 18, 2009. According to Sakurai, this album continues to explore the idea of \"straight rock\". After the release of the album, they then went on to perform an extended concert tour spanning three months. The final concerts were held at Tokyo's NHK Hall.\n\nIn March 2010, the group released the single \"Dokudanjou Beauty\". The second single of 2010 was released on September 1 titled \"Kuchizuke\" (\"Kisses\"), which was used as the opening theme for Fuji TV's \"Shiki\" anime. On October 13, Buck-Tick released its seventeenth studio album titled \"Razzle Dazzle\". Which for the most part continued the straightforward rock sound, but also contained many instances of dance-rock, it also included cover artwork by graphic artist Aquirax Uno.\n\nBuck-Tick's song \"Jupiter\" was covered by DuelJewel on the compilation \"Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-\", which was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement. Their song \"Speed\" was covered by 9Goats Black Out on its sequel, \"Crush! 2 -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-\", that was released on November 23, 2011.\n\nTo celebrate their 25th anniversary, Buck-Tick opened a special website where they announced the creation of their own record label Lingua Sounda, and that its first releases will be a new single in spring 2012 and an album in the summer. They released two separate boxsets in March 2012, one containing work from 1987 to 1999 and the other from 2000 to 2010, titled \"Catalogue Victor→Mercury 87–99\" and \"Catalogue Ariola 00–10\" respectively. The single \"Elise no Tame ni\" was released on May 23, the same day as the DVD of their 2011 Day in Question concert. The band also performed the theme song for the play \"Tenshu Monogatari\". Their next single, \"Miss Take ~Boku wa Miss Take~\", was released on July 4. Fans who ordered both \"Miss Take\" and \"Elise\" had a chance to win tickets to the band's promotional video shoot for the new song \"Climax Together\".\n\nA second tribute album to Buck-Tick was released on July 7, titled \"Parade II -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-\" it featured 13 artists including acid android, Polysics and Acid Black Cherry. The band released their eighteenth studio album, \"Yume Miru Uchuu\", on September 19 before holding Buck-Tick Fest 2012 On Parade on September 22 and 23, which attracted an estimated 14,000 fans and included bands who appear on the tribute album such as D'erlanger, Mucc, Merry, Pay money To my Pain and others.\n\nThe special 25th Anniversary film \"Buck-Tick ~Buck-Tick Phenomenon\" was shown in theaters in two parts in 2013, part one opening on June 15 and two on June 22, each for one week only. The band wrote two new songs exclusive for the film, \"Love Parade\" composed by Hoshino and \"Steppers -Parade-\" by Imai. Buck-Tick released the single \"Keijijou Ryuusei\" on May 14, 2014 and their nineteenth studio album, \"Arui wa Anarchy\", on June 4.\n\nOn June 28, 2015, Buck-Tick performed at the Lunatic Fest hosted by Luna Sea and were joined onstage by J for \"Iconoclasm\". At the end of their Day in Question concert on December 29, 2015 the band announced their return to Victor Entertainment with Lingua Sounda becoming its sub label. On September 11, 2016 the group played the live show entitled Climax Together 3rd at Yokohama Arena, 12 years after their second one and 24 years after their first one. Buck-Tick released the single \"New World\" on September 21, 2016, and on September 28 their twentieth studio album \"Atom Miraiha No.9\".\n\nBuck-Tick won the special \"Inspiration Award Japan\" at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. Their single \"Babel\" was released on November 15, 2017. Following the February 21, 2018 release of its second single \"Moon Sayonara wo Oshiete\", Buck-Tick's twenty-first album \"No. 0\" was released on March 14. They performed on the first night of the special hide 20th Memorial Super Live Spirits event at Tokyo Otaiba Yagai Tokusetsu Stage J Chikuon on April 28, 2018 in memory of hide.\n\nBuck-Tick's music has changed and evolved hugely over the course of their career. Their early work is what the Japanese call \"positive punk\". It used simple rhythms and chords, with the songs mostly in major keys and using some English words in the lyrics. Starting with 1989's \"Taboo\", they experimented with a darker sound, which grew more mature with \"Kurutta Taiyou\" in 1991. \"Darker Than Darkness -Style 93-\" delved into a harsher industrial rock sound which continued all the way up through \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" in 2003. More recently, with 2005's \"Juusankai wa Gekkou\", they have deliberately adopted a \"goth\" concept, which they combined with a retro straight rock sound for the albums \"Tenshi no Revolver\" (2007) and \"Memento Mori\" (2009). Their next album, 2010's \"Razzle Dazzle\", then incorporated many instances of dance-rock.\n\nSome elements that persist throughout their music are resounding, jangling guitar chords, throbbing, prominent bass lines, harsh roars of electronically distorted noise, and ambivalent melodies that wander between major and minor keys, as well as Sakurai's distinctive rich baritone voice. Sakurai is famous for the erotic decadence of his lyrics (which are now predominantly in Japanese), but he also often addresses existential psychological themes. The song \"Rakuen (Inori Koinegai)\" caused controversy because some of the lyrics were lifted from the Quran and later the album was re-issued with the offending part removed by November 1995. Imai has written many songs that read like science fiction stories, involving genetic engineering and computer hackers, but more recently has branched out into simple love songs.\n\nBuck-Tick was most strongly influenced by Western rock, especially British post-punk from the 1970s and 1980s, though they cite a few Japanese influences as well. The influences that the band members collectively name the most often are Love & Rockets, Robert Smith, and Bauhaus (the band admitted to going together to see Peter Murphy live.) They also mention the Sex Pistols and XTC. Imai was especially influenced by Love & Rockets, and this is very evident on Buck-Tick's album \"Kurutta Taiyou\". He was also influenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra, Kraftwerk, Ultravox and other new wave and electronica acts, and the punk band The Stalin. Sakurai was hugely influenced by David Bowie, and he even played a cover of Bowie's song \"Space Oddity\" at his solo live in 2004. He is also influenced by post-punk/first wave goth acts such as The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Clan of Xymox, and Der Zibet and Masami Tsuchiya. He claims to love \"dark\" music in general. Hoshino and Yagami love The Beatles. Yagami is also a fan of Led Zeppelin and other classic metal/punk acts like Kiss and The Clash.\n\nRegarded as one of the founders of visual kei, Buck-Tick have influenced as many bands and musicians as they have been influenced by. Kiyoharu (Kuroyume, Sads) interviewed Sakurai twice on his personal radio show in conjunction with Buck-Tick's anniversary festival and declared Sakurai to be \"so hot\" and \"a wonderful person\". Takanori Nishikawa (Abingdon Boys School) is another open fan of Buck-Tick, and interviewed the entire band on the TV program \"Pop Jam\". Dir en grey vocalist Kyo was inspired to become a rock star after seeing a picture of Sakurai on the desk of a junior high school classmate. Likewise, his bandmate Die became interested in rock music in junior high after hearing \"Aku no Hana\". D vocalist Asagi listed Buck-Tick as one of their biggest influences. His bandmate Tsunehito named Buck-Tick as one of his two favorite Japanese bands. Nagoya kei band Deadman cited Buck-Tick as an inspiration. Well-known visual kei rock musicians Tatsurou (Mucc), Yuu (Merry), Aie (Deadman), Lay (Fatima) and Tsuyoshi (Karimero) formed a Buck-Tick cover band called Bluck-Tlick.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Munro-Hay comments that this motto is \"a rather attractive peculiarity of Aksumite coinage, giving a feeling of royal concern and responsibility towards the people's wishes and contentment\".\n"}

{"id": "2281616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281616", "title": "Ukrainian diaspora", "text": "Ukrainian diaspora\n\nThe Ukrainian diaspora is the global community of ethnic Ukrainians, especially those who maintain some kind of connection, even if ephemeral, to the land of their ancestors and maintain their feeling of Ukrainian national identity within their own local community.\n\nAfter the loss suffered by the Ukrainian-Swedish Alliance under Ivan Mazepa in the Battle of Poltava in 1709, some political emigrants, primarily Cossacks, settled in Turkey and in Western Europe.\n\nIn 1775, after the fall of the Zaporozhian Sich to the Russian Empire, some more Cossacks emigrated to Dobruja in the Ottoman Empire (now in Romania), while others settled in Volga and Ural regions of the Russian Empire.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Ukrainians from the Transcarpathian Region formed agricultural settlements in the Kingdom of Hungary, primarily in the Bačka and Syrmia regions. Both are now located in the Vojvodina Region of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nIn time, Ukrainian settlements emerged in the major European capitals, including Vienna, Budapest, Rome and Warsaw.\n\nIn 1880, the Ukrainian diaspora consisted of approximately 1.2 million people, which represented approximately 4.6% of all Ukrainians, and was distributed as follows:\n\n\nIn the last quarter of the 19th century due to the agrarian resettlement, a massive emigration of Ukrainians from Austro-Hungary to the Americas and from the Russian Empire to the Urals and Asia (Siberia and Kazakhstan) occurred.\n\nA secondary movement was the emigration under the auspices of the Austro-Hungarian government of 10,000 Ukrainians from Galicia to Bosnia.\n\nFurthermore, due to Russian agitation, 15,000 Ukrainians left Galicia and Bukovina and settled in Russia. Most of these settlers later returned.\n\nFinally in the Russian Empire, some Ukrainians from the Chełm and Podlaskie regions, as well as most of the Jews, emigrated to the Americas.\n\nSome of those who left their homeland returned. For example, from the 393,000 Ukrainians who emigrated to the United States of America, 70,000 returned.\n\nMost of the emigrants to the United States of America worked in the construction and mining industries. Many worked in the US on a temporary basis, to earn remittances.\n\nIn the 1890s, Ukrainian agricultural settlers emigrated to first to Brazil, and Argentina. However, the writings of Galician professor and nationalist Dr. Joseph Oleskiw were influential in redirecting that flow to Canada. He visited an already-established Ukrainian block settlement, which had been founded by Iwan Pylypiw, and met with Canadian immigration officials. His two pamphlets on the subject praised the United States as a place for wage labour, but stated that Canada was the best place for agricultural settlers to obtain free land. By contrast he was fiercely critical of the treatment Ukrainian settlers had received in South America. After his writings, the slow trickle of Ukrainians to Canada greatly increased.\n\nBefore the start of the First World War, almost 500,000 Ukrainians emigrated to the Americas. This can be broken down by country as follows:\n\nIn 1914, the Ukrainian diaspora in the Americas numbered about 700,000-750,000 people, located as follows:\n\n\nMost of the emigrants to the Americas belonged to the Greek Catholic Church. This led to the creation of Greek Catholic bishops in Canada and the United States of America. The need for solidarity lead to the creation of Ukrainian religious, political, and social organisations. These new Ukrainian organisations maintained links with the homeland, from which books, media, priests, cultural figures, and new ideas arrived. Furthermore, local influence, as well as influence from their homeland, led to the process of a national re-awakening. At times, the diaspora was ahead of their times in this re-awakening.\n\nEmigrants from the Transcarpathian and Lemko regions created their own organisations and had their own separate Greek Catholic church hierarchy (Ruthenian Catholic Church). These emigrants are often considered to be Rusyns or Ruthenians and are considered by some to be distinct from other Ukrainians. However, in Argentina and Brazil, immigrants from Transcarpathia and Lemkivshchyna did identify themselves as Ukrainians.\n\nThe majority of the Ukrainian diaspora in the Americas focused on freeing the nation and obtaining independence. Thus, during the First World War and the fight for freedom in Ukraine (1919–1920), the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States of America and Canada actively sought to get the governments to support their cause. An interesting note is the role the Ruthenians played to convince the United States' government about the inclusion of the Transcarpathian region into the Czechoslovak Republic in 1919. The Ukrainian diaspora sent delegates to the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ukrainian diaspora in the Russian Empire, and especially in Asia, was primarily agrarian. After 1860, the diaspora was primarily located in the Volga and Ural Regions, while in the last quarter of that century, due to a lack of space for settlement, the diaspora expanded into Western Siberia, Turkestan, the Far East, and even into the Zeleny Klyn. In the Russian Empire's 1897 census there were 1,560,000 Ukrainians divided as follows:\n\n\nIn the next decades, Ukrainian emigration to Asia increased (almost 1.5 million Ukrainians emigrated), so that in 1914 there were almost 2 million Ukrainians in the Asian part of the Russian Empire. In all of the Russian empire, there was a Ukrainian diaspora of 3.4 million Ukrainians. Most of this population was assimilated due to a lack of national awareness and closeness with the local Russian population, especially in religion.\n\nUnlike the emigrants from Austro-Hungary, the Ukrainian emigrants in the Russian Empire did not create their own organisations nor were there many interactions with their homeland. Only, the revolution of 1917 allowed the creation of Ukrainian organisations, which were linked with the national and political rebirth in Ukraine.\n\nThe First World War and the Russian Civil War led to the first massive political emigration, which strengthened the existing Ukrainian communities by infusing them with members from political, scientific, and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, some of these new emigrants formed Ukrainian communities in Western and Central Europe. Thus, new communities were created in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, France, Belgium, Austria, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The largest was in Prague, which was considered one of the centres of Ukrainian culture and political life (after Lviv and Kraków).\n\nThis group of emigrants created many different organisations and movements associated with corresponding groups in the battle for independence. A few Ukrainian universities were founded. Furthermore, many of these organisations were associated with the exiled Ukrainian government, the Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the new diaspora maintained links with the Soviet Ukraine. A Sovietophile movement appeared, whereby former opponents of the Bolsheviks began to argue that Ukrainians should support the Soviet Ukraine. Some argued that they should do so because the Soviet republics were the leaders of international revolution, while others claimed that the Bolsheviks' social and national policies benifted Ukraine. This movement included Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Yevhen Petrushevych. Many émigrés, for example Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, returned and helped the Bolsheviks implement their policy of Ukrainianisation. However, the abandonment of Ukrainianisation, the return to collectivisation and the man-made famine of 1932-3 ended this tendency. Most of the links were broken, with the exception of some Sovietophile organisations in Canada and the United States of America.\n\nOn the other hand, the Canadian and American diaspora maintained links with the Ukrainian community in Galicia and the Transcarpathian Region.\n\nThe political emigration decreased in the middle 1920s due to a return to the homeland and a decline in students studying at the Ukrainian universities.\n\nIn 1920–1921, Ukrainians left Western Ukraine to settle in the Americas and Western Europe. Most of the emigrates settled in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, France, the UK and Belgium. The economic crisis of the early 1930s stopped most of the emigration. Later, the emigration picked up. The number of emigrants can be approximated as:\n\n\nFurthermore, many Ukrainians left the Ukrainian SSR and settled in Asia due to political and economic factors, primarily collectivisation and the famine of 1920.\n\nThe Ukrainian diaspora, outside of the Soviet Union, was 1.7-1.8 million people, divided by place as follows:\n\nAccording to the soviet census of 1926, there were 3,450,000 Ukrainians living outside of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, divided as follows:\n\n\nIn Siberia the vast majority of the Ukrainians lived in the Central Asian region and in the Zeleny Klyn. On January 1, 1933, there were about 4.5 million Ukrainians (larger than the official figures) in the Soviet Union outside of the Ukrainian SSR, while in America there were 1.1-1.2 million Ukrainians.\n\nIn 1931, the Ukrainian diaspora can be counted as follows:\n\nUkrainian Diaspora in 1931\nIn the Ukrainian SSR, there were 25,300,278 Ukrainians.\n\nThe Ukrainian diaspora increased after 1945 due to a second wave of political emigrants. The 250,000 Ukrainians at first settled in Germany and Austria. In the latter half of the 1940s and early 1950s, these Ukrainians were resettled in many different countries creating new Ukrainian settlements in Australia, Venezuela, and for a time being in Tunisia (Ben-Metir), as well as re-enforcing previous settlements in the United States of America, Canada (primarily Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec), Brazil (specially in the South and Southeast regions), Argentina and Paraguay. In Europe, there remained between 50,000 and 100,000 Ukrainians that settled in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\nThis second wave of emigrants re-invigorated Ukrainian organisations in the Americas and Western Europe. In 1967, in New York City, the World Congress of Free Ukrainians was created. Scientific organisations were created. There was created an Institute of Ukrainian Studies at Harvard.\n\nAn attempt was made to unite the various religious organisations (Orthodox and Greek Catholic). However, this did not succeed. In the early 1970s, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the United States of America and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Europe, South America, and Australia managed to unite. Most of the other Orthodox churches maintained with each other some religious links. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church had to wait until 1980 until its synod was recognised by the Vatican. The Ukrainian Evangelical and Baptist churches also created an All-Ukrainian Evangelical-Baptist Union.\n\nDuring the latter Soviet time there was a strong net migration in the USSR. Most of the Ukrainian contingent that was leaving the Ukrainian SSR for other areas of the Union settled in places with other migrants. The cultural separation from Ukraine proper meant that many were to form the so-called \"multicultural soviet nation\". In Siberia, 82% of Ukrainian entered mixed marriages, primarily with Russians. This meant that outside the parent national republic there was little or no provision for continuing a diaspora function. Thus only in large cities such as Moscow would Ukrainian literature and television could be found. At the same time other Ukrainian cultural heritage such as clothing and national foods were preserved. According to Soviet sociologist, 27% of the Ukrainians in Siberia read Ukrainian printed material and 38% used the Ukrainian language. From time to time, Ukrainian groups would visit Siberia. Nonetheless most of the Ukrainians did assimilate.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, the Ukrainian diaspora can be divided as follows:\n\n\nIn all these countries, Ukrainians had the status of a minority nation with their own socio-cultural organisations, schools, and press. The degree of these rights varied from country to country. They were greatest in Yugoslavia.\n\nThe largest Ukrainian diaspora was in Poland. It consisted of those Ukrainians, which were left in the western parts of Galicia that after the Second World War remained in Poland and had not emigrated to the Ukrainian SSR or resettled, and those who were resettled to the western and northern parts of Poland, which before the Second World War had been part of Germany.\n\nUkrainians in Czechoslovakia lived in the Prešov Region, which can be considered Ukrainian ethnographic territory, and had substantial rights. The Ukrainians in the Prešov Region had their own church organisation.\n\nUkrainians in Romania lived in the Romanian parts of Bukovina and the Maramureş Region, as well as in scattered settlements throughout Romania.\n\nUkrainians in Yugoslavia lived primarily in Bancka and Srem regions of Vojvodina and Bosnia. These Ukrainians had their own church organisation as the Eparchy of Križevci.\n\nOf the countries where the Ukrainian diaspora had settled, only in Canada and the Soviet Union were information about ethnic background collected. However, the data from the Soviet Union is suspect and underestimates the number of Ukrainians. In 1970, the Ukrainian diaspora can be given as follows:\n\n\nFor the Soviet Union, it can be assumed that about 10-12 million people of Ukrainian (7-9 million in Asia) heritage live outside the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nAfter the independence of Ukraine, many Ukrainians have emigrated to Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Russia, and Italy due to the uncertain economic and political situation at home.\n\nMany Ukrainians live in Russia either along the Ukrainian border or in Siberia. In the 1990s, the number of Ukrainians living in the Russian Federation was calculated to be around 5 million. These regions, where Ukrainians live, can be subdivided into 2 categories:\nRegions along the mixed Ukrainian-Russian border territory and The Far East territory:\n\nUkrainians can also be found in parts of Romania and Slovakia that border Ukraine.\n\nThe size of the Ukrainian diaspora has changed over time due to the following factors:\n\nIn 2004, the Ukrainian diaspora was distributed as follows:\n\nUkrainian diaspora\n\nUkrainian diaspora distribution around the world\n\nIn 2016, there were an estimated 1,359,655 persons of full or partial Ukrainian origin residing in Canada (the majority being Canadian-born citizens), making them Canada's eleventh largest ethnic group and giving Canada the world's third-largest Ukrainian population behind Ukraine itself and Russia.\n\nAccording to a 2006 government estimate, there were 976,314 Americans of Ukrainian ancestry.\n\nUkrainians constitute the second-largest foreign community residing in Portugal, with 44,074 residents in 2012.\n\nIn Serbia, there are 4,903 (0,08%) ethnic Ukrainians with Serbian citizenship according to the 2011 census. According to the 2002 census there were 5,354 (0,82%) and according to the 1991 census 5,042. Until 1971, Ukrainians and Pannonian Rusyns were counted together.\n\n\n\n"}

He was named by the FBI as the 475th fugitive to be placed on the list of FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives on June 29, 2002.\n\nRobert William Fisher was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1961 to William Fisher, a banker, and Jan Howell. He has two sisters with whom he attended Sahuaro High School in Tucson, Arizona. His parents divorced in 1976, when Fisher was 15 years of age. According to friends and relatives, the divorce was very turbulent and unsettling, leaving long-lasting effects on him. He reportedly spoke of it with coworkers at Mayo Clinic Hospital and once confided to an associate that his life would have been different had his mother not left the family.\n\nFisher, a U.S. Navy veteran, married Mary Cooper in 1987.\nHe has worked as a surgical catheter technician, respiratory therapist, and firefighter, and is an avid outdoorsman, hunter, and fisherman. Fisher was described as a cruel and distant control freak of a father who was awkward with his children, but who tried to hold on to an image as a devoted family man. His mother-in-law, Ginny Cooper, told investigators that, \"Fisher didn't socialize often with family because of a fear of getting too close to people and losing them.\"\n\nFisher's mother told investigators that she had been a \"yes-sir\" wife who did not stand up to her husband. She added that she saw similar dynamics early in her son's marriage to Mary and that she had spoken to her daughter-in-law about her concerns. A close friend of Fisher stated that his family bore a striking resemblance to that of his childhood.\n\nFisher had been an active member of the Scottsdale Baptist Church's men's ministry, but unlike Mary, he had begun to withdraw from its activities a few months prior to the murders. In 1998, the Fishers went to their church's senior pastor for marital counseling. Fisher told coworkers about a one-night affair with a prostitute he met in a massage parlor. He fretted that Mary would find out that it was the cause of a urinary tract infection that left him ill for several days in December 2000.\n\nFisher told a hunting mate that he was renewing his commitment to his faith and marriage because he \"could not live without his family\", possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is not unusual for an individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent. In the weeks before her death, Mary told several friends that she was going to divorce Fisher. A neighbor reported hearing a loud argument on April 9, at 10:30pm, approximately ten hours before their house blew up in an explosion.\n\nOn the morning of April 10, 2001, Mary was shot in the back of the head and her children's throats were slashed from ear to ear in the hours before their house exploded at 8:42 am. Firefighters were immediately alerted to the explosion, which was strong enough to collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for in all directions. Firefighters kept the blaze from spreading to other homes. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the burning house.\n\nThe gas line from the back of the house's furnace had been pulled out in an attempt to conceal evidence of the homicides. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate ten hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. The burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the remains of the burnt out house. They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10). Investigators theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what he did as a child.\n\nFisher, who disappeared at the time of the murders, was named as an official (and to date, only) person of interest in the case on April 14, 2001, when Arizona Department of Public Safety officers were instructed in a statewide bulletin to arrest him. On April 20, the last physical evidence of Fisher's whereabouts surfaced, when police found Mary's Toyota 4Runner and their dog, Blue, in Tonto National Forest, near the town of Young, Arizona, a hundred miles north of Scottsdale. Although police searched the area around where the car was found, it has been alleged that they did not search the nearby network of caves sufficiently. Several professional cavers have suggested that Fisher used these as a hiding place, before either escaping, killing himself or dying from low oxygen levels.\n\nOn July 19, a state arrest warrant was issued in Phoenix, charging Fisher with three counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson. Subsequently, he was declared a fugitive, and a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, charging him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. On June 29, 2002, Fisher was named by the FBI as the 475th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list. He was also on the \"America's Most Wanted\" \"Dirty Dozen\" list of the show's most notorious fugitives, and was profiled on \"The Hunt with John Walsh\". The FBI offers a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his capture. , FBI had received \"hundreds and hundreds of leads.\" However, all reported sightings of Fisher have been inconclusive or false.\n\nIn February 2004, an individual with a striking physical resemblance to Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Fingerprints eventually confirmed that he was not Fisher. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a family member correctly identified him. The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that Fisher may be living in the Payson area in Gila County, Arizona. In October 2014, police raided a house in Commerce City, Colorado after receiving a tip that Fisher was hiding there. Despite arresting two occupants, they did not find any sign of Fisher.\n\nFisher is considered armed and extremely dangerous and has ties to Florida and New Mexico. There has been speculation that he has committed suicide or started a new life under an assumed identity. FBI agent Caldwell's sense of his personality and habits is that he is \"arrogant. He's cocky. He's a know-it-all...and a loner.\" He chews tobacco and favors the Copenhagen brand, sometimes walks in an odd, erect manner with his chest out due to back pain, and is an avid hunter and fisherman.\n\nIn April 2016, FBI officials and Scottsdale police displayed new age-enhanced photos of Fisher during a news conference on the fifteenth anniversary of the murders.\nThe backdoor pilot of the CBS show \"FBI: Most Wanted\" depicted a story nearly identical to Fisher's. It aired on April 2, 2019, as episode 18 of season 1 of the CBS show \"FBI\". It was written by Rene Balcer, and the series, like its parent show, is produced by Dick Wolf.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281650", "title": "Antoni Lange", "text": "Antoni Lange\n\nAntoni Lange (1863 – 17 March 1929) was a Polish poet, philosopher, polyglot (15 languages), writer, novelist, science-writer, reporter and translator. A representative of Polish Parnassianism and symbolism, he is also regarded as belonging to the Decadent movement. He was an expert on Romanticism, French literature and a popularizer of Eastern cultures.\nHis most popular novel is \"Miranda\".\n\nHe translated English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, Indian, American, Serbian, Egyptian and Oriental writers into Polish and Polish poets into French and English. He was also one of the most original poets of the Young Poland movement. His work is often compared to Stéphane Mallarmé and Charles Marie René Leconte de Lisle.\n\nLange was an uncle of the poet Bolesław Leśmian.\n\nLange was born in Warsaw into the patriotic Jewish family of Henryk Lange (1815–1884) and Zofia \"née\" Eisenbaum (1832–1897). His father took part in the November Uprising against the Russian Partition of Poland. He was an admirerer of Romantic literature and its ideals. Antoni Lange enrolled at Warsaw University but around 1880 he was expelled for his patriotic activity by the Tsarist namiestnik Apuchtin who ruled the university at that time. He supported himself financially as a tutor but also published poetry under the pen-names Napierski and Antoni Wrzesień. He decided to study in Paris where he encountered new trends in literature, philosophy and art. In France he became familiar with the theories of Jean Martin Charcot, as well as Spiritualism, parapsychology, the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, oriental religions, European and Eastern literature and modern literary criticism. He took part in the literary meetings of Stéphane Mallarmé.\n\nLange returned to his homeland upon Poland's return to independence, and became one of the better known members of the Warsaw Society of Writers and Journalists (\"Warszawskie Towarzystwo Literatów i Dziennikarzy\"), the precursor of the Polish Academy of Literature founded in 1933. Bolesław Prus, Julian Ochorowicz and Lange were the first Polish spiritists. He rented an apartment at Nowy Świat Street together with Władysław Reymont, a Polish writer and the winner of the Nobel Prize of 1924. Stanisław Brzozowski called Lange \"a real and not frequently European mind\" and Julian Tuwim called him \"a master of reflective poetry\". During this time Lange was a member of the Society of Polish Writers and Journalists. However, with the sharp growth of his popularity as a poet his poems became more sceptical, pessimistic and hermetic. The main theme of the poems of this period was the feeling of being isolated and misunderstood by the crowd.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century he withdrew from public life and became lonely and forgotten. He collected his last poems in notebooks and never allowed anyone to publish them.\n\nLange's prestige as a writer was undermined by a new generation of avant-gardists. He died in isolation, destitution and obscurity in Warsaw in 1929. He never married and had no children.\n\nAntoni Lange was a friend of Stéphane Mallarmé, Jan Kasprowicz and Stanisław Przybyszewski.\n\nThere are only two portraits of Lange, one of them was painted by Stanisław Wyspiański in 1890.\n\nLange was a prolific and versatile writer. He wrote many novels (\"Miranda\"), short stories (\"Zbrodnia\", \"Amor i Faun\"), dramas (\"Malczewski\", \"Wenedzi\"), essays and poems. Lange's poetry is contemplative and erudite. It connects the traditions of European culture with Buddhism. The overriding theme of Lange's existential concerns was 'extremity' and the 'cycle' of death. In order to form of the poetry Lange connect to contradictory points of impressionism, romantic sentimentality and experimentary theories of Stéphane Mallarmé. Lange was fond of rare poetic forms: acrostics, dactyls, pantoums, praeludiums, scherzos, canticles and triolets. He was also the author of many pastorals concerning the metaphysical side of village life; historiosophical songs inspired by the philosophy of Juliusz Słowacki; and exotic genesis mythologies from all over the world (from Mexico to Japan).\n\nLange was also the author of many lyrical essays presenting original views about the relationship between poet and reader concerning eschatological issues (\"Thoughts\", \"The Grave\").\n\nIn the first phase of his writing he was a lover of esthetism, formal innovation and the theories of Stéphane Mallarmé. However, later he faced to primitivism, anonymity, writings of folk poets and 16th century poets and blank verse.\nBoth Lange and Jerzy Żuławski are often referred to as \"The Pioneers of Polish Science-Fiction\". Lange's short stories from the book \"W czwartym wymiarze\" (In the Fourth Dimension, 1912) such as \"Babunia\" (Grandma), \"Rozaura\", \"Lenora\", \"Rebus\" (Puzzle), \"Nowe mieszkanie\" (The New House) and \"Memoriał doktora Czang-Fu-Li\" (Dr. Chang Fu Li's Report) are regarded as early examples of science fiction and weird fiction in Poland. The main themes of the stories are: hypnosis, the elixir of youth, eternal love and the materialization of phantoms. On a different note, Dr. Chang Fu Li's eponymous report, \"written in Paris in 2652\", is concerned with the climate change brought about by the re-routing of the Gulf Stream and the subsequent freezing over of Europe, with China taking over as the leading civilization.\n\nLange's works influenced many poets of the next generation, for example: Bolesław Leśmian, Antoni Słonimski, Julian Tuwim, Julian Przyboś, Jan Lechoń, Leopold Staff. Paradoxically, most of these poets criticized Lange for his anachronism, eccentricity and \"overintellectualism\".\n\nLange was also a left wing journalist. He wrote for many important Polish newspapers such as \"Pobudka\", \"Tygodnik Illustrowany\" or \"Przegląd tygodniowy\". He created an original way of cultural assimilation for Jews via mixed marriage.\n\nLange's numerous translations of classic 19th century literature from all over the world are still highly regarded. His translations of \"The Golem\" by Gustav Meyrink and poems by Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe and George Gordon Byron are masterpieces of Polish translation. He also edited many anthologies of his own translations of Egyptian, Syrian, Persian, Arabian, Indian and Hebrew poems.\n\nHis main sources of inspiration were: the poetry of the Three Bards,; the theories of Stéphane Mallarmé; the writings of Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle; Sanskrit epics of ancient India such as \"Mahabharata\" or \"Savitri\"; and the poetry of the Polish Baroque era, especially metaphysical poets such as Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński and Józef Baka because of their obsession with death.\n\nLange was the author of many love poems influenced by Romanticism, spiritualism and Indian mythology.\n\nOther love poems by Lange, for example \"Vita Nova\" (A New Life) written in 1898, present an original vision of a decadent and melancholy poet who momentarily becomes an Übermensch thanks to the illusion of requited love. Unfortunately, there is always a conflict between the vision of ideal love and its realisation. Lange takes also notes the \"painful impossibility\" of the absolute and eternal union of lovers' souls; he creates a pesimistic vision of the relationship between man and woman, which is always burdened by the certainty that complete fulfilment is impossible.\nIn Lange's verses love always makes the subject feel as if he has been \"exiled\" from and \"deprived\" of a latent part of his own existence, but simultaneously he believes that lovers can communicate and feel the same by transmitting their pain and the power of their affection in defiance of metaphorical distance.\n\nThe most characteristic feature of Lange's writings is the strong influence of Eastern traditions, religions and philosophies such as Veda, Brahminism and Buddhism.\n\nWritten in 1887, the cycle of seven sonnets entitled \"The Sonnets of Veda\" shows the seven stages of human existence on its way to Nirvana.\n\nThe writing similar to \"Sonnets of Veda\" in order to form is \"Logos\". It is a cycle of ten sonnets which discuss with ten points of view on \"logos\" of history by ten outstanding representatives of historiosophy of Polish Romanticism. The poems are strongly influenced by ideas of messianism.\n\n\"The Hour\" written in 1894 was the first prose of Lange, but the short symbolic novel was published in 1895 in the first volume of \"Poems\". It is a story of Artemis and Auora, the two ancient goddesses who descends to Earth to bear witness to problems of human life. In some points \"The Hour\" is similar to the drama \"A Dream Play\" written by August Strindberg in 1901 and \"The Woman without a Shadow\" written by Hugo von Hofmannsthal in 1919. The novel contains many mystical fragments stylized on some kind of religious texts, psalms, manifesto, the greek tragedy and the ode. It also connects prose with elements of poetry and drama.\n\nOne of the most representative Lange's writing is \"Deuteronomion\", a mystical occultic poem written in Paris in 1902. It is very hermetic and hard to interpret because of its many allusions to the Bible, Kabbalah, Sanscrit and ancient Slavic legends. The poem tells about a person of a Poet who travels within his soul to hammer out a great initiation of himself and the universe. It is meaningful that \"Deuteronomion\" begins with the \"Epilogue to myself\" and ends with the \"Prologue to the unknown god\".\n\nLange inaugurated a return to narrative poetry, a form which was unprecedented in Polish literature. This species of poetry was mainly used in Romanticism (for example, by George Gordon Byron or Adam Mickiewicz) and in late 19th century went out of use. Therefore, Lange was probably the last and only poet who wrote narrative poems in Poland. There are:\n\nLange wrote also \"A Song of Płanetnik\", a narrative poem referred to a character of Płanetnik. Płanetnik is a little Slavic ghost from the legends of pagans who lived from the earliest historical times to the Middle Ages on Polish territories. He was a guardian of clouds and a lonely dreamer who predicted the weather. It was supposed that Płanetniks were stray souls of suiciders and victims of murder. One would call them by sprinkling flour to the wind or fire. \"A Song of Płanetnik\" by Lange tells the story of a young sensitive man who lost contact with reality and set off on a solitary existence.\n\nIn Lange's cosmogony-philosophy, he announced that evolution of the soul is parallel to evolution of a nation. Capitalism is the enemy of this principle because it acts against individualism, so capitalism is the ideology of the anonymous crowd. If there is no individualism among the people, then there is also not a problem of \"bad\" versus \"good\". Then the world comes to disturb its own logic. According to Lange, a world that 'was being born' from ideal space, is still coming to the highest stage of evolution; sometime, it will return to its primary stage. Every step to evolution is a step to the ideal primary. An exception of this \"rule of time-line\" is the person of genius, who is between the times. In Lange's philosophy he referred to Giambattista Vico and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\nLange was interested in spiritualism and parapsychology to contain his own philosophy.\n\nAn important part of Lange's writing was the criticism of legacy of romanticism in modern poetry. In 1924 he founded \"Astrea\", a science-magazine and the first forum about the Polish and European romanticism. Lange rejected romantic illumination and brainwave. In his view theological truth is within the reach only of erudition, intellect and afterthought. Lange criticized also the importance of individualism and the authorial personality. Placing the poem as an artwork at the center, as an \"eidos\" of poetry, he affirmed the \"poem's own existence\" and a \"clear idea of creation\", therefore he disagreed with the cult of individualism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The bridge was named after its designer, George Henderson (engineer), of Rumford, Rhode Island.\n\nThis is the sixth bridge to have been built in this part of the Seekonk River. The first was a wooden bridge built by Moses Brown in 1793 called the Central Bridge, which connected the respective ends of Waterman Avenue. The same year, Brown's brother John built the first Washington Bridge at a ferry landing point one mile south, connecting India Point and Watchemoket Square. The second and third bridges were built as replacements and were destroyed in 1807 and 1815, respectively. A swing bridge was built in 1872, which was replaced by a sturdier bridge of the same type in 1895.\n\nThe Henderson Bridge was part of an envisioned expressway that was planned as a US 44 freeway that would have extended from a Gano Street interchange with Interstate 195. The current Gano Street ramps were built specifically for the proposed US 44 freeway, which was planned to follow along the west shore of the Seekonk River, over the Henderson Bridge, and then head northeasterly through East Providence, to US 44 just east of Route 114 and US 1A. Since the freeway was never completed, the section that exists today was not given a route number, though is commonly referred to as the Henderson Expressway. The planned freeway's right-of-way and landholdings still exist in East Providence, where they are completely cleared to the freeway's proposed end at US 44.\n\nWoods and trails under and around the East Providence side of the bridge are often used by dirt-bikers for recreational use. River Road exists beneath the Providence side of the bridge, and provides access to Blackstone Park and Trails (a breach in the fence-line on the westbound side of the bridge near the \"South Angell Street\" signage provides quick access into the park); (a short path on the eastbound side of the bridge before the ascent onto the bridge provides access to River Road).\n\nOn April 17, 2008, it was reported that the bridge requires $50 million worth of repairs, but the state only had $3.3 million to allocate. Some problems noted are cracks in the concrete pier caps & rusting steel beams. RIDOT chief engineer Kazem Farhoumand has stated that steel reinforcements can be bolted onto the steel beams to make them \"good for another 5 or 10 years.\" The Henderson was one of 25 bridges to receive \"minor repairs\" in late 2015, after a \"hurry-up\" program of bridge inspections in August 2015.\n\nTransit and bike advocates have asked for years that the bridge be replaced by a more multimodal structure. In February 2019 it was announced that the existing four lane bridge will be replaced with a new two lane bridge with pedestrian and bike lanes. The cost is an estimated $60–70 million, with $54.5 million coming from a federal spending bill and the rest from the state. It is expected that the bridge will retain its signature red color.\n\n\n"}

He also acted extensively on the stage.\n\nHe was best known for his role as Grouty in the sitcom \"Porridge\" (despite appearing in only three episodes and in the 1979 film), and had a recurring role alongside Robert Lindsay in \"Citizen Smith\", written by John Sullivan. He played Tom Franklin in \"Chancer\" (1990–1991), the father of Anthony Hopkins's character in \"The Remains of the Day\", and Maester Aemon in HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" (2011–2015), his final role.\n\nVaughn was born Peter Ewart Ohm on 4 April 1923 in Wem, Shropshire, the son of a bank clerk, Max Ohm, who was an Austrian immigrant, and Eva Wright, a nurse. The family later moved to Wellington, in the same county, where he began his schooling. Vaughan said that while reciting a poem at infant school in Wellington he first experienced the applause and admiration coming from a good performance. From the age of seven he lived in Staffordshire, where he attended Uttoxeter Grammar School.\n\nAfter leaving school, Vaughan joined the Wolverhampton Repertory Theatre, and gained experience in other repertory theatres as well, before army service during the Second World War. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals on 9 June 1943, and served in Normandy, Belgium, and the Far East. At the end of the war, Vaughan was in Singapore during the liberation of Changi Prison.\n\nVaughan made his film debut in 1959 in an uncredited role as a police officer in \"The 39 Steps\". He continued for several years to play small parts, including more cameos as policemen in \"Village of the Damned\" and \"The Victors,\" before gaining his first starring role, in a minor picture called \"Smokescreen\" (1964), where he played an insurance assessor investigating a businessman’s disappearance in one of the last, and best, of the old-style British B-movies. In 1967, he received second billing opposite Frank Sinatra in the film \"The Naked Runner\". His performance was not well received by critics who accused him of overacting in his role as a British agent. He played Mr. Freeman in Karel Reisz's 1980 \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\", alongside Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons.\n\nPossibly Vaughan’s highest-profile film performance was as the father of Anthony Hopkins's character in \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993). He was also cast in Terry Gilliam's \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\", but had not shot any material before that project was abandoned. He had previously appeared for Gilliam in \"Time Bandits\" and \"Brazil\". Vaughan appeared as a menacing character in \"Straw Dogs\" (1971), and with Bill Murray in a film of W.

{"id": "2281680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281680", "title": "Podsafe", "text": "Podsafe\n\nPodsafe is a term created in the podcasting community to refer to any work which, through its licensing, specifically allows the use of the work in podcasting, regardless of restrictions the same work might have in other realms. For example, a song may be legal to use in podcasts, but may need to be purchased or have royalties paid for over-the-air radio use, television use, and possibly even personal use.\n\nPodsafe music gained modest popularity in the early days of podcasting, largely because of podcaster resources like the now-defunct Podsafe Music Network. Most podcasters were just hobbyists at that point. In the early 2010s, the podcast industry professionalized with the advent of podcast-oriented media companies such as Earwolf. Some traditional media organizations such as NPR started making podcasting a major part of their strategy. As more money started pouring into the industry, the content diversified and podsafe music faded into obscurity.\n\nThe effective definition of \"podsafe\" for a given work depends entirely on the contract through which the podcaster licenses the work; there is no single podsafe license.\n\nWhile some works (such as public domain works or works under some Creative Commons licenses) are inherently podsafe, the only actual requirement for a work to be podsafe is that any licensing requirements it has, if applicable, allow for the work's free use (typical broadcast use in its original form, if in no other form, depending on the specific license) in a podcast or web broadcast. This gives specific favor to podcasts only, allowing the artist to impose more traditional constraints on everyone else. Podsafe licensing can, for example, continue to require non-podcast consumers to pay for the work, require royalties on derivative works, and profit significantly from the work's use in traditional radio, television, or film.\n\nThe licensor of any podsafe work must be legally capable of making it so. An artist cannot distribute his or her own work through a podsafe license if doing so would break any laws or breach any standing agreements (e.g. with the RIAA). The creator of a derivative work may also not claim this work podsafe without express permission from the original copyright holders. (PMN has more specific and stringent terms to this effect in its agreement.)\n\nAnother point of contention is that not all podcasts are non-commercial works. Even in the early days, an increasing number of podcasts were taking on sponsors and looking to make a profit. In general, no significant distinction was made between podsafe for non-commercial use and podsafe for commercial use.\n\nAs podcasting grows more and more popular, illegal use of heavily licensed music (as through the RIAA) starts to grow at an extremely high pace. This is in general of greater concern to podcasters than to the typical sharer of music, because podcasters usually produce their shows for and promote them to the public.\n\nIncluding such licensed music legally has its own set of caveats. Many licensing agencies, if they do intend to allow the use of their music on podcasts, will require not only the payment of royalties but also the use of DRM on the shows. (DRM, because of its proprietary, system-specific nature, would be destructive to the general openness and system independence of podcasts.)\n\nUse of podsafe music instead of more stringently licensed material allows a podcaster to continue to produce an inexpensive, legal program with little hassle. Not least important for an independent podcaster is the promise of being able to avoid the confusing maze of licensing organizations.\n\nConventional radio (and television) can present a difficult, and not always logical, barrier of entry for a musician or other media artist involving large sums of money and often a great deal of surrender in both ownership and creative freedom.\n\nIn contrast, podcasting, an increasingly popular medium for audio programs, is more receptive to artists and input. While a conventional radio show may be able to replay a large part of its music selection from day to day, there would be little point in downloading a music podcast whose selection did not vary significantly from a previous show.\n\n\n"}

It debuted on September 6, 1986, as the flagship program of the WWF's syndicated programming.\n\nIn January 2019, select episodes of \"WWF Superstars\" starting from April 1992 became available for streaming on the WWE Network.\n\nIn September 1986, \"Superstars\" replaced \"WWF Championship Wrestling\". Before that, \"WWF Superstars Of Wrestling\" was the name of a weekly recap show hosted by Vince McMahon (or Gene Okerlund) and Lord Alfred Hayes that lasted from 1984 through August 1986. The new version of \"Superstars\" was the program on which all the angles began and at times ended and on which the majority of title changes took place if not at a pay-per-view event (e.g. WrestleMania or SummerSlam). Matches primarily saw top tier and mid-level talent versus jobbers; pre-taped interviews with the WWF's roster of superstars; and promos featuring the wrestlers. At times, there was a \"feature\" match between main WWF talent. As with all syndicated WWF programming, another major aspect of the show was to promote house shows and TV tapings in each market.\n\nDuring its syndication run, the program was re-branded and aired in some parts of Canada as \"Maple Leaf Wrestling\" (essentially replacing a program of the same name filmed in southern Ontario), despite having almost no Canadian content other than interviews promoting matches that were to be held in Canada, along with occasional program-exclusive matches taped at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario. However, this repackaging was, at the time, sufficient to allow the program to count towards Canadian content requirements for local television stations. Some Canadian viewers were able to watch American feeds of the show and/or \"WWF Challenge.\" \n\nThe show also began airing in 1986 in the United Kingdom on Saturday nights on Sky Channel. For a short time, it was shown on Tuesdays on Eurosport. Early in the 1990s, it was featured in a Friday night time slot. In the mid-1990s, \"Superstars\" was then moved to a Sunday morning time slot. For most of it original run in the United Kingdom Gorilla Monsoon was the play-by-play commentator with various color commentators throughout its history.\n\nBeginning with the April 18, 1992 episode, the program was renamed to \"WWF Superstars\", due to a successful lawsuit by another promoter, Albert Patterson, who had claimed prior rights to the phrase \"Superstars of Wrestling\". Since then, archival footage of the program has usually been shown with the words \"of Wrestling\" blurred out where applicable.\n\nIn September 1996, \"Superstars\" left syndication and moved to USA Network in place of \"WWF Action Zone\", which the network cancelled. Although for a brief period the show continued in its same format, as time went on more and more recaps of the WWF's other programming began to fill the hour. By March 1997, \"Superstars\" was solely a summary program and continued in that manner until its eventual ending.\n\nIn 1997, the format of \"Superstars\" as aired in the United Kingdom also changed and began to only feature weekly summaries of \"Monday Night Raw\". Following the premiere of \"SmackDown!\", \"Superstars\" served as a summary show for \"SmackDown!\" as well.\n\nWhen the WWF moved its cable TV contract to TNN (later known as Spike, now known as the Paramount Network) in September 2000, \"Superstars\" moved with it. The show was then discontinued in August 2001. The show continued until December 2002 in the UK, until it was replaced by \"Heat\" in January 2003.\n\nMany of these title changes were not aired for up to several weeks after they took place. As these shows were aired in an era before the Internet was popularized, the previous title holder sometimes defended his title at house shows as though he were still the champion until the title change was aired on television.\n\n\nThe commentary team on \"Superstars\" underwent many changes as the years passed. The hosts of \"Superstars\" are listed below in chronological order along with their debut episode.\n\n\n\nWWE abandoned the \"Superstars of Wrestling\" trademark when they changed the show's name to \"WWF Superstars\" in the early 1990s. Albert Patterson, a Wisconsin independent wrestling promoter, successfully trademarked the phrase in 1993. Although there has been litigation between the WWE and Patterson, WWE has not been able to settle with Patterson for the usage of \"\"Superstars of Wrestling\"\". Due to this issue, WWE blurs the \"Superstars of Wrestling\" banners when archival content is shown on the WWE Network.\n\n"}

It was the result of a combination of local architectural traditions and European Baroque.\n\nUkrainian Baroque is distinct from the Western European Baroque in having more moderate ornamentation and simpler forms, and as such was considered more constructivist. Many Ukrainian Baroque buildings have been preserved, including several buildings in Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and the Vydubychi Monastery in Kiev.\n\nThe best examples of Baroque painting are the church paintings in the Holy Trinity Church of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Rapid development in engraving techniques occurred during the Ukrainian Baroque period. Advances utilized a complex system of symbolism, allegories, heraldic signs, and sumptuous ornamentation.\n\nUkrainan Baroque sculptor Johann Georg Pinsel, who was active during the mid-18th century in Galicia, was the subject of a special 2012–13 exhibition at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Pinsel, who demonstrated a unique, masterful expressiveness of form and a highly personal characterization of drapery is now recognized as a leading figure in European Baroque sculpture.\n\nCertain features of the Ukrainian Baroque influenced the Naryshkin Baroque movement in 17th-18th century in Moscow.Modern Ukrainian church buildings, such as Troeshchina Cathedral, are also built in this style, but it is not typical for Ukrainian Baroque. Originating in the 17th century, Ukrainian Baroque reached its golden age in the time of Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Mazepa Baroque is original synthesis of West-European Baroque architectural forms and Ukrainian national Baroque architectural traditions.\n\n\n\n"}

The Gano family moved to Wisconsin in 1973, when his father opened an American Baptist church in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee. Rev. Gano, an accomplished actor, also formed a community theater group in Oak Creek, and Gordon appeared in many of its productions, notably \"Sing Out, Sweet Land\" in 1976. His father played guitar, and exposed his son to a wide array of musical genres, including country and western, show tunes, and gospel. The liner notes to the Violent Femmes's compilation album \"Permanent Record\" describe Gano as \"\"a devout Baptist\"\".\n\nIn 1979 the Gano family moved to nearby Hales Corners, where his father took over an existing American Baptist congregation. At this time Gordon began attending Milwaukee public school—Rufus King High School, from which he graduated in 1981. After graduating from high school, he worked briefly as an encyclopedia salesman.\n\nOlder siblings from his parents' previous marriages living in the NYC area exposed the young Gano to such influences as The Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Brian Eno, Patti Smith, Jonathan Richman, and The B-52's. Gordon's garage band days began with covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and moved through Grateful Dead (Hunter/Garcia) songs to Lou Reed and Velvet Underground songs by 1979. Gordon began writing his own songs in the mid '70s, influenced by the vocal stylings of Lou Reed, the story-telling of Hank Williams, Sr. and the poetics of Patti Smith's \"Babelogue\". Given his acting background, Gordon wrote many of his songs for characters, whom he would portray while performing the associated song.\n\nGano joined Violent Femmes in Milwaukee in 1981 with bassist Brian Ritchie and drummer Victor DeLorenzo. They soon developed an enthusiastic following thanks to songs such as \"Blister in the Sun,\" \"Kiss Off\" and \"Add It Up\" (all included on their self-titled debut album). The band has experimented with a variety of sounds over the course of its career, such as country and western (\"Hallowed Ground\") and pop-rock (\"The Blind Leading the Naked\"). Gano plays guitar, sings and writes most of the band's songs.\n\nDuring a Violent Femmes hiatus in the late 1980s, Gano formed a gospel-punk group called The Mercy Seat with vocalist Zena Von Heppinstall, bassist Patrice Moran, and drummer Fernando Menendez. They toured internationally for two years and released a self-titled album in 1987 on Warner Music Group's Slash Records. The album was re-released digitally in 2009 on Wounded Bird Records.\n\nHe released his first solo album in 2002, titled \"Hitting the Ground\". He shared vocal duties with Manuel Cruz, the lead singer of the Portuguese rock band Ornatos Violeta in the song \"Capitão Romance\", with Gano singing in Portuguese. Gano also played violin on Ben Vaughn's 1990 album \"Dressed in Black\".\n\nGano contributed to the 2004 multi-artist collaboration \"\", alongside artists including Beck, The Eels, TV on the Radio and Death Cab for Cutie, on which he provides a rendition of Johnston's \"Impossible Love.\"\n\nGano wrote, recorded and performed with ex-members of The Bogmen, Billy and Brendan Ryan, under the name Gordon Gano & The Ryans. Their only album, entitled \"Under the Sun\", was released in September 2009 on Yep Roc Records.\n\n"}

This is a subsaturated environment for liquid water but a supersaturated environment for ice resulting in rapid evaporation of liquid water and rapid ice crystal growth through vapor deposition. If the number density of ice is small compared to liquid water, the ice crystals can grow large enough to fall out of the cloud, melting into rain drops if lower level temperatures are warm enough.\n\nThe Bergeron process, if occurring at all, is much more efficient in producing large particles than is the growth of larger droplets at the expense of smaller ones, since the difference in saturation pressure between liquid water and ice is larger than the enhancement of saturation pressure over small droplets (for droplets large enough to considerably contribute to the total mass). For other processes affecting particle size, see rain and cloud physics.\n\nThe principle of ice growth through vapor deposition on ice crystals at the expense of water was first theorized by the German scientist Alfred Wegener in 1911 while studying hoarfrost formation. Wegener theorized that if this process happened in clouds and the crystals grew large enough to fall out, that it could be a viable precipitation mechanism. While his work with ice crystal growth attracted some attention, it would take another 10 years before its application to precipitation would be recognized.\n\nIn the winter of 1922, Tor Bergeron made a curious observation while walking through the woods. He noticed that on days when the temperature was below freezing, the stratus deck that typically covered the hillside stopped at the top of the canopy instead of extending to the ground as it did on days when the temperature was above freezing. Being familiar with Wegener's earlier work, Bergeron theorized that ice crystals on the tree branches were scavenging vapor from the supercooled stratus cloud, preventing it from reaching the ground.\n\nIn 1933, Bergeron was selected to attend the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics meeting in Lisbon, Portugal where he presented his ice crystal theory. In his paper, he stated that if the ice crystal population was significantly small compared to the liquid water droplets, that the ice crystals could grow large enough to fall out (Wegener's original hypothesis). Bergeron theorized that this process could be responsible for all rain, even in tropical climates; a statement that caused quite a bit of disagreement between tropical and mid-latitude scientists. In the late 1930s, German meteorologist Walter Findeisen extended and refined Bergeron's work through both theoretical and experimental work.\n\nThe condition that the number of droplets should be much larger than the number of ice crystals depends on the fraction of cloud condensation nuclei that would later (higher in the cloud) act as ice nuclei. Alternatively, an adiabatic updraft has to be sufficiently fast so that high supersaturation causes spontaneous nucleation of many more droplets than cloud condensation nuclei are present. In either case, this should happen not far below the freezing point as this would cause direct nucleation of ice. The growth of the droplets would prevent the temperature from soon reaching the point of fast nucleation of ice crystals.\n\nThe larger supersaturation with respect to ice, once present, causes it to grow fast thus scavenging water from the vapor phase. If the vapor pressure formula_1 drops below the saturation pressure with respect to liquid water formula_2, the droplets will cease to grow. This may not occur if formula_2 itself is dropping rapidly, depending on the slope of the saturation curve, the lapse rate, and the speed of the updraft, or if the drop of formula_1 is slow, depending on the number and size of the ice crystals. If the updraft is too fast, all the droplets would finally freeze rather than evaporate.\n\nA similar limit is encountered in a downdraft. Liquid water evaporates causing the vapor pressure formula_1 to rise, but if the saturation pressure with respect to ice formula_6 is rising too fast in the downdraft, all ice would melt before large ice crystals have formed.\n\nKorolev and Mazin derived expressions for the critical updraft and downdraft speed:\n\nwhere \"η\" and \"χ\" are coefficients dependent on temperature and pressure, formula_9 and formula_10 are the number densities of ice and liquid particles (respectively), and formula_11 and formula_12 are the mean radius of ice and liquid particles (respectively).\n\nFor values of formula_13 typical of clouds, formula_14 ranges from a few cm/s to a few m/s. These velocities can be easily produced by convection, waves or turbulence, indicating that it is not uncommon for both liquid water and ice to grow simultaneously. In comparison, for typical values of formula_15, downdraft velocities in excess of a few formula_16 are required for both liquid and ice to shrink simultaneously. These velocities are common in convective downdrafts, but are not typical for stratus clouds.\n\nThe most common way to form an ice crystal starts with an ice nucleus in the cloud. Ice crystals can form from heterogeneous deposition, contact, immersion, or freezing after condensation. In heterogeneous deposition, an ice nucleus is simply coated with water. For contact, ice nuclei will collide with water droplets that freeze upon impact. In immersion freezing, the entire ice nucleus is covered in liquid water.\n\nWater will freeze at different temperatures depending upon the type of ice nuclei present. Ice nuclei cause water to freeze at higher temperatures than it would spontaneously. For pure water to freeze spontaneously, called homogeneous nucleation, cloud temperatures would have to be . Here are some examples of ice nuclei:\n\n As the ice crystals grow, they can bump into each other and splinter and fracture, resulting in many new ice crystals. There are many shapes of ice crystals to bump into each other. These shapes include hexagons, cubes, columns, and dendrites. This process is referred to as \"ice enhancement\" by atmospheric physicists and chemists.\n\nThe process of ice crystals sticking together is called aggregation. This happens when ice crystals are slick or sticky at temperatures of and above, because of a coating of water surrounding the crystal. The different sizes and shapes of ice crystals fall at different terminal velocities and commonly collide and stick.\n\nWhen an ice crystal collides with supercooled water it is called accretion (or riming). Droplets freeze upon impact and can form graupel. If the graupel formed is reintroduced into the cloud by wind, it may continue to grow larger and more dense, eventually forming hail.\n\nEventually this ice crystal will grow large enough to fall. It may even collide with other ice crystals and grow larger still through collision \ncoalescence, aggregation, or accretion.\n\nThe Bergeron Process often results in precipitation. As the crystals grow and fall, they pass through the base of the cloud, which may be above freezing. This causes the crystals to melt and fall as rain. There also may be a layer of air below freezing below the cloud base, causing the precipitation to refreeze in the form of ice pellets. Similarly, the layer of air below freezing may be at the surface, causing the precipitation to fall as \nfreezing rain. The process may also result in no precipitation, evaporating before it reaches the ground, in the case of forming virga.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the second-largest of its type in Germany. The Senckenberg Museum is particularly popular with children, who enjoy the extensive collection of dinosaur fossils: Senckenberg boasts the largest exhibition of large dinosaurs in Europe. One notable exhibit is a dinosaur fossil with unique, preserved scaled skin. The museum contains a large and diverse collection of birds with 90,000 bird skins 5,050 egg sets 17,000 skeletons and 3,375 spirit specimens. In 2010, almost 517,000 people visited the museum.\n\nThe building housing the Senckenberg Museum was erected between 1904 and 1907 outside of the center of Frankfurt in the same area as the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, which was founded in 1914. The museum is owned and operated by the Senckenberg Nature Research Society, which began with an endowment by Johann Christian Senckenberg.\n\nToday, visitors are greeted outside the building by large, life-size recreations of dinosaurs, which are based on the latest scientific theories on dinosaur appearance. Inside, one can follow the tracks of a \"Titanosaurus\", which have been impressed into the floor, towards its skeleton on a sheltered patio.\n\nAttractions include a \"Diplodocus\" (donated by the American Museum of Natural History on the occasion of the present museum building's inauguration in 1907), the crested Hadrosaur \"Parasaurolophus\", a fossilized \"Psittacosaurus\" with clear bristles around its tail and visible fossilized stomach contents, and an \"Oviraptor\". Big public attractions also include the \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", an original of an \"Iguanodon\", and the museum's mascot, the \"Triceratops\".\n\nAlthough the dinosaurs attract the most visitors due to their size, the Senckenberg Museum also has a large collection of animal exhibits from every epoch of Earth's history. For example, the museum houses many originals from the Messel pit: field mice, reptiles, fish and a predecessor to the modern horse that lived about 50 million years ago and stood less than 60 cm tall.\n\nUnique in Europe is a cast of the famous \"Lucy\", an almost complete skeleton of the upright hominid \"Australopithecus afarensis\". Historical cabinets full of stuffed animals are arranged in the upper levels; among other things one can see one of twenty existing examples of the quagga, which has been extinct since 1883.\n\nSince the remodeling finished in 2003, the new reptile exhibit addresses both the biodiversity of reptiles and amphibians and the topic of nature conservation. An accessible rain forest tree offers views of different zones of the rain forest from the ground to the tree canopy and the habitats to which the exotic reptiles have adapted.\n\nThe Senckenberg Museum offers regular evening lectures and tours. One such lecture, by Alfred Wegener on 6 January 1912, was the first public exposition of the theory of Continental Drift \n\n"}

The following year, driving the new Ford Escort RS Cosworth, he won the Acropolis Rally and led the driver's championship for part of the season.\nThroughout Biasion's tenure at Ford he was overshadowed by the younger François Delecour, who generally proved to be faster, especially on tarmac. Moreover, Delecour's road accident, which forced him to sit out much of the 1994 season, exposed the weaknesses in the team. Insufficient resources meant that development of the Escort slipped behind its rivals, and Biasion's relationship with the team worsened as the season progressed. He was subsequently dropped for the following year. After contesting a couple of rallies for private teams, he retired quietly at the end of the 1995 season (his 2 last WRC events were part of the 2LWC prior to the late Colin McRae's honor as '95 World Rally Champion, but this truly last WRC event was the RAC (now Wales Rally GB) in '94 when it was won by McRae himself and Didier Auriol's honor as '94 World Rally Champion).\n\nThroughout his entire career he was co-driven by Tiziano Siviero, the sole exception being the Portuguese Rally of 1988, where Siviero was replaced by Carlo Cassina due to health problems.\n\nBiasion won the World Truck Championship in 1998 and 1999 driving an Iveco.\n\n"}
{"id": "2281776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281776", "title": "South Carolina in the American Revolution", "text": "South Carolina in the American Revolution\n\nSouth Carolina was outraged over British tax policies in the 1760s that violated what they saw as their constitutional right to \"no taxation without representation\". Merchants joined the boycott against buying British products. When the London government harshly punished Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party, South Carolina's leaders joined 11 other colonies (except Georgia) in forming the Continental Congress. When the British attacked Lexington and Concord in the spring of 1775 and were beaten back by the Massachusetts Patriots, South Carolina rallied to support the American Revolution. Loyalists and Patriots of the colony were split by nearly 50/50.\nMany of the South Carolinian battles fought during the American Revolution were with loyalist Carolinians and the part of the Cherokee tribe that allied with the British. This was to General Henry Clinton's advantage. His strategy was to march his troops north from St. Augustine, Florida, and sandwich George Washington in the North. Clinton alienated Loyalists and enraged Patriots by attacking a fleeing army of Patriot soldiers who posed no threat. Enslaved Africans and African Americans chose independence by escaping to British lines where they were promised freedom.\n\nCombined Continental Army and state militia forces under the command of Major General Nathanael Greene regained control of much of South Carolina by capturing the numerous interdependent chain of British held forts throughout the State. One-by-one, the British and Loyalists were surrounded in Charles Town and became completely dependent on supplies by sea. After preliminary peace terms had been agreed, the British evacuated Charles Town on December 14, 1782, a day now officially designated as \"South Carolina Independence Day\". Greene was awarded a Congressional Medal and numerous other official awards from the State of South Carolina for his leadership in liberating the state and for restoring an elected government. In 1787, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Pierce Butler went to Philadelphia where the Constitutional Convention was being held and constructed what served as a detailed outline for the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter Parliament began taxing the North American colonies to raise revenue to make up for the costs of the French and Indian War and Pontiac's Rebellion, to protest the Stamp Act, South Carolina sent wealthy rice planter Thomas Lynch, 26-year-old lawyer John Rutledge, and Christopher Gadsden to the Stamp Act Congress. Gadsden, leader of the pro-Independence \"Liberty Boys,\" is often grouped with James Otis and Patrick Henry as the prime agitators for American independence by historians. Gadsden designed the \"Don't Tread on Me\" flag, first used on December 3, 1775, on the \"Alfred\", featuring a rattlesnake with 13 rattles representing each colony.\n\nIn 1767, the Townsend Acts levied new taxes on glass, oil, wine, tea, paper, and other goods. Gadsden led the opposition and although Britain removed the taxes on everything except tea, Charlestonians mirrored the Boston Tea Party by dumping a shipment of tea into the Cooper River. Other shipments were allowed to land, but they rotted in Charles Town storehouses.\n\nDelegates from twelve colonies, all of the Thirteen Colonies except for Georgia, came together for the First Continental Congress in 1774. Five South Carolinians, including those who represented the colony in the Stamp Act Congress, headed for Philadelphia. Henry Middleton served as president for part of Congress. The following January the South Carolina colonial assembly was disbanded by Royal Governor Lord William Campbell, and it was reformed as an extralegal Provincial Congress. During this meeting and following meetings, in June 1775 and March 1776, the South Carolinians created a temporary government to rule until the colony had settled things with Britain. John Rutledge was voted \"president\" of the state which was called the \"General Assembly of South Carolina\" (the term \"Republic\" or \"Republic of South Carolina\" was never used.)\n\nMost Loyalists came from the Upcountry, which thought that domination by the rich, elitist Charles Town planter class in an unsupervised government was worse than remaining under the rule of the British Crown. Judge William Henry Drayton and Reverend William Tennent were sent to the Back Country to gain support for the \"American Cause\" and Lowcountry's General Committee and Provincial Congress but did not have much success. In September 1775, the Royal Governor dissolved the last-ever Royal Assembly in South Carolina and left for the safety of the British warship \"Tamar\" in the Charleston Harbor.\n\nThroughout the course of the American Revolutionary War, over 200 battles were fought within South Carolina, more than in any other state. On November 19, 1775, Patriot forces of the Long Cane Militia fought Loyalists in the first battle of Ninety Six, resulting in the death of James Birmingham, the first South Carolinian and southerner of the war. Colonel Richard Richardson led a large party of Whigs into the Upcountry to arrest Loyalists and to assert the power of the revolutionary General Committee over the entire colony.\n\nBritain's strategy was to take advantage of strong Loyalist support in the South, begin a military drive in Charles Town, and perhaps sweep through the Upcountry, North Carolina, and Virginia while gathering men to take on Washington in the North. Under Colonel William Moultrie, the South Carolinians defeated the Royal Navy in the Battle of Sullivan's Island on June 28, 1776, and brought the Patriot Continental Army a major victory. In Philadelphia, the news reached delegates of the Second Continental Congress on July 19, over two weeks after delegates had voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence. The Battle of Sullivan's Island also caused the British to rethink their strategy and leave the South for approximately three years.\n\nThe new state legislature met the next December to complete the state constitution made the previous October, de-establishing the Anglican Church. In the Upcountry, the British had convinced the Cherokee to fight on their side. Although the British officer in charge of the operation had told the Cherokee to attack only Patriot soldiers in organized groups, soon murder and cabin burnings were widespread on the frontier. The Whigs' Andrew Williamson, Andrew Pickens, and James Williams, who had been battling Loyalists in the Upcountry, launched a successful campaign against the Cherokee. In 1777 they ceded their remaining lands to the South Carolina government. On February 5, 1778, South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States. In 1780, the British returned to South Carolina.\n\nIn 1780, the British, stalemated in the north and facing pressure from home to end the war, embarked on a plan of action that would come to be known to historians as \"The Southern Strategy.\" They planned to trap George Washington's troops by pushing their troops up from the South while Washington defended himself in the North. The British landed a major expeditionary force south of Charleston, landing on John's Island, moving to James Island, and then besieging Charles Town. General Benjamin Lincoln defended the city during a two-month siege but was forced to surrender almost all the Continental forces in the Carolinas to General Clinton. Henry Middleton, once president of the Continental Congress, was forced to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown as a prisoner.\n\nGeneral Washington begged Governor John Rutledge and the rest of the state's council to leave Charles Town while there was still time, and they did. Rutledge traveled around the state, printing proclamations and other state papers on a printing press he had with him, and sending numerous letters demanding that the Continental Congress send the Continental Army to relieve South Carolina.\nThe British quickly established control over the coast, making posts at the other port cities of Beaufort and Georgetown. It was during this time that many enslaved African Americans managed to escape to their lines. The African Americans wanted freedom, and the British promised them that. Approximately 25,000 African Americans, one-quarter of the enslaved population, escaped to the British during the war to achieve freedom.\n\nThe British followed their coastal occupation by establishing posts upcountry where they could establish control by coordinating with local Tories.\n\nResponding to Rutledge's pleas and the British threat to the whole southern flank, Washington sent an army of Continentals under General Gates, but was defeated at Camden on August 16, 1780, and the remnant of the army retreated northward in record time.\n\nJust before the battle of Camden, Gates met with Francis Marion, a militia officer who had escaped parole at the defeat of Charleston because of an accidental injury, which caused him to be out of town at the surrender. Marion had a small group of rag-tag militia men with him, whose appearance evoked derision from the Continentals. Gates saw Marion as an embarrassment and got rid of him by giving him orders to scout the British and destroy boats, bridges, and other items that might be useful to the British.\n\nMarion left, obeying his orders, and missed the battle. The following day, by order of Governor Rutledge, and by invitation of the troops, he accepted command of the Williamsburg militia at the confluence of Lynches River and the Pee Dee River. This band joined together with a few other militiamen from around the state became known as Marion's Brigade (Marion was eventually commissioned general). Marion had not yet heard the news of Gates' defeat at the time. The next day a small militia under Thomas Sumter was surprised and completely routed at Fishing Creek; Sumter barely escaped with his life. At this point, Marion had the only viable Patriot army left in the South. From that time until the arrival of General Nathanael Greene, the war's outcome in the south depended entirely on the militia, and the militia gradually turned the tide.\n\nThe war was not only a clash of arms but a battle for the sympathy of the population. After leaving Gates, Marion began a new and unheard of policy, as he destroyed boats the British might use, and commandeered food, horses and other property from the settlers. He had his troops issue receipts for each item to the owners. His gentlemanly actions quickly made Marion a hero and garnered support for his brigade. Many of these receipts were redeemed after the war, with the new state government usually paying in full.\n\nGeneral Clinton thought that South Carolina was a Loyalist colony that had been bullied into revolutionary actions by a small minority. His idea was to increase British presence in the entire state and bring back the confidence of moderates in the area so that they would fight for the British. Clinton alienated Loyalists by spending all of the money on extra arms and soldiers rather than doctors.\n\nAmerican Colonel Abraham Buford and his body of Virginia patriots had set south in hopes of defending Charles Town but turned back when they realized they were too late. British Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton was unwilling to let the rebels escape back to the North and chased after them, another act that alienated more loyalists. Tarleton caught up with them on May 29, 1780, near the present town of Lancaster, South Carolina, and Americans were told to surrender, but refused. They still marched forward with full knowledge that Tarleton was fast approaching. In the Battle of Waxhaws the Americans were routed by Tarleton and his men, who suffered minimal casualties. Due to confusion in the battle, quarter was refused, and a number of Americans who had surrendered were killed. This spawned the battle cry that Southern patriots would use for the rest of the war, \"Tarleton's quarter!\".\n\nThe second British blunder was Clinton revoking the Carolinians' paroles. He broke his promise that if the Carolinians who surrendered did not actively seek to harass the British government, he would leave them and their paroles alone. On June 3, he proclaimed that all prisoners of war could either take up arms against their fellow Americans or be considered traitors to the Crown. Many soldiers, whose pride had already been bruised, reasoned that if they were going to have to take the chance of getting shot again, they might as well fight on the side they wanted to win.\n\nThe third British mistake was burning the Stateburg, South Carolina, home and harassing the incapacitated wife of a then inconsequential colonel named Thomas Sumter. Because of his fury over this, Sumter became one of the fiercest and most devastating guerrilla leaders of the war, becoming known as \"The Gamecock\". The Lowcountry partisans fighting under Marion and Upcountry partisans fighting under Andrew Pickens (whose home had also been burned) plagued the British by using guerilla warfare in the mountains, woods, and swamps of the state.\n\nOn October 8, 1780, at Kings Mountain, American Colonel Isaac Shelby led a body of North and South Carolinians and attacked British Major Patrick Ferguson and his body of American loyalists on a hilltop. America's first major poet, William Cullen Bryant, described the home field advantage that led to the Patriot victory in one of his poems. This was a major victory for the Patriots, especially because it was won by militiamen and not trained Continentals. It provided a great swing of momentum for the moderate \"Overmountain Men\" who had grown tired of British brutality. Kings Mountain is considered to be the turning point of the revolution in the South, because it squashed any significant further recruitment of Loyalists, and compelled Cornwallis to temporarily abandon North Carolina.\n\nThat December, General Nathanael Greene arrived with an army of Continental troops. When Greene heard of Tarleton's approach, he sent Brigadier General Daniel Morgan and his backwoodsmen over the Appalachian Mountains to stop him. On January 17, 1781, the two forces met at a grassy field with widespread hardwoods, reeds, and marsh in a well-known cattle grazing area called Cowpens. Pickens and his guerilla soldiers joined Morgan directly before the battle. Morgan still felt they were not strong enough to take on Tarleton's trained troops and wanted to cross a river that would separate them from the British and secure them a chance to retreat. Pickens convinced Morgan that staying on the British side of the river would force his men to fight it out in what some historians consider the best-planned battle of the entire war. The Patriots defeated the British and later battles at Hobkirk's Hill and Eutaw Springs would further weaken the British.\n\nFighting continued throughout 1781 in the backcountry, where patriot and loyalist militias alike looted homes and killed civilians. One of the most infamous is William \"Bloody Bill\" Cunningham's \"Bloody Scout,\" who terrorized homes and massacred dozens of Whigs.\n\nIn December 1782, the British evacuated Charles Town. The overjoyed residents changed the name to \"Charleston\" because it sounded \"less British.\"\n\nSouth Carolina had one of the strongest Loyalists factions of any state. About 5000 men took up arms against the Patriot government during the revolution, and thousands more were supporters who avoided taxes, sold supplies to the British, and who had avoided conscription. Nearly all had emigrated to the province after 1765, as only about one in six was native-born. About 45% of the Loyalists were small farmers, 30% were merchants, artisans or shopkeepers; 15% were large farmers or plantation owners, and 10% were royal officials. Geographically, they were strongest in the back-country, where most settlers before the revolution had opposed the coastal aristocracy\n\nSouth Carolina had endured bitter internal strife between Patriots and Loyalists during the war (esp. 1780-82). Nevertheless, it adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of their property. The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for the confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.\n\nIn 1787, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Pierce Butler went to Philadelphia where the Constitutional Convention was piecing together the Constitution. At thirty years old, Charles Pinckney had long been a critic of the weak Articles of Confederation. Although he was wealthy by birth and quite the epicurean, Pinckney became the leader of democracy in the state. On May 29, 1787, he presented the Convention with a detailed outline of the United States Constitution, and John Rutledge provided valuable input. Pierce Butler, a major slaveholder who lost numerous slaves during the war who escaped to the British, included a constitutional clause for the return of fugitive slaves.\n\nThe federal, and Federalist-leaning, Constitution was ratified by the state in May 1788. The new state constitution was ratified in 1790 without the support of the Upcountry. The Lowcountry elite, who had only a quarter of the state's white inhabitants, still ruled the state as they controlled three-quarters of South Carolina's wealth, much of it in enslaved African Americans.\n\nDuring the 1780s, Charleston physician David Ramsay published two of the first histories of the American Revolution: \"The History of the Revolution of South-Carolina\" (1785) and \"The History of the American Revolution\" (1789).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281782", "title": "History of thermodynamics", "text": "History of thermodynamics\n\nThe history of thermodynamics is a fundamental strand in the history of physics, the history of chemistry, and the history of science in general. Owing to the relevance of thermodynamics in much of science and technology, its history is finely woven with the developments of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, magnetism, and chemical kinetics, to more distant applied fields such as meteorology, information theory, and biology (physiology), and to technological developments such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine, cryogenics and electricity generation. The development of thermodynamics both drove and was driven by atomic theory. It also, albeit in a subtle manner, motivated new directions in probability and statistics; see, for example, the timeline of thermodynamics.\n\nThe ancients viewed heat as that related to fire. In 3000 BC, the ancient Egyptians viewed heat as related to origin mythologies. \nIn the Western philosophical tradition, after much debate about the primal element among earlier pre-Socratic philosophers, Empedocles proposed a four-element theory, in which all substances derive from earth, water, air, and fire. The Empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as phlogin and caloric. Around 500 BC, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus became famous as the \"flux and fire\" philosopher for his proverbial utterance: \"All things are flowing.\" Heraclitus argued that the three principal elements in nature were fire, earth, and water. \nIn the early modern period, heat was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the \"caloric\". Bodies were capable of holding a certain amount of this fluid, leading to the term \"heat capacity\", named and first investigated by Scottish chemist Joseph Black in the 1750s.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists abandoned the idea of a physical caloric, and instead understood heat as a manifestation of a system's internal energy. Today heat is the transfer of disordered thermal energy. Nevertheless, at least in English, the term \"heat capacity\" survives. In some other languages, the term \"thermal capacity\" is preferred, and it is also sometimes used in English.\n\nAtomism is a central part of today's relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Ancient thinkers such as Leucippus and Democritus, and later the Epicureans, by advancing atomism, laid the foundations for the later atomic theory. Until experimental proof of atoms was later provided in the 20th century, the atomic theory was driven largely by philosophical considerations and scientific intuition.\n\nThe 5th century BC Greek philosopher Parmenides, in his only known work, a poem conventionally titled \"On Nature\", uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, essentially what is now known as a vacuum, in nature could not occur. This view was supported by the arguments of Aristotle, but was criticized by Leucippus and Hero of Alexandria. From antiquity to the Middle Ages various arguments were put forward to prove or disapprove the existence of a vacuum and several attempts were made to construct a vacuum but all proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe European scientists Cornelius Drebbel, Robert Fludd, Galileo Galilei and Santorio Santorio in the 16th and 17th centuries were able to gauge the relative \"coldness\" or \"hotness\" of air, using a rudimentary air thermometer (or thermoscope). This may have been influenced by an earlier device which could expand and contract the air constructed by Philo of Byzantium and Hero of Alexandria.\n\nAround 1600, the English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon surmised: \"Heat itself, its essence and quiddity is motion and nothing else.\" In 1643, Galileo Galilei, while generally accepting the 'sucking' explanation of \"horror vacui\" proposed by Aristotle, believed that nature's vacuum-abhorrence is limited. Pumps operating in mines had already proven that nature would only fill a vacuum with water up to a height of ~30 feet. Knowing this curious fact, Galileo encouraged his former pupil Evangelista Torricelli to investigate these supposed limitations. Torricelli did not believe that vacuum-abhorrence (\"Horror vacui\") in the sense of Aristotle's 'sucking' perspective, was responsible for raising the water. Rather, he reasoned, it was the result of the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding air.\n\nTo prove this theory, he filled a long glass tube (sealed at one end) with mercury and upended it into a dish also containing mercury. Only a portion of the tube emptied (as shown adjacent); ~30 inches of the liquid remained. As the mercury emptied, and a partial vacuum was created at the top of the tube. The gravitational force on the heavy element Mercury prevented it from filling the vacuum.\n\n \nThe theory of phlogiston arose in the 17th century, late in the period of alchemy. Its replacement by caloric theory in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry. Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from combustible substances during burning, and from metals during the process of rusting. Caloric, like phlogiston, was also presumed to be the \"substance\" of heat that would flow from a hotter body to a cooler body, thus warming it.\n\nThe first substantial experimental challenges to caloric theory arose in Rumford's 1798 work, when he showed that boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction, and his work was among the first to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the steam engine also focused attention on calorimetry and the amount of heat produced from different types of coal. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice calorimeter following research by Joseph Black on the latent heat of water.\n\nMore quantitative studies by James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, and helped to place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, was still trying to explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete by the end of the 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as thermochemistry.\n\n\nIrish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation: P.V=constant. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later. Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring. Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave Gay-Lussac the opportunity to derive his law, which led shortly later to the ideal gas law. But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named Denis Papin built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine. He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. One such scientist was Sadi Carnot, the \"father of thermodynamics\", who in 1824 published \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\", a discourse on heat, power, and engine efficiency. This marks the start of thermodynamics as a modern science.\n\nHence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the Savery Engine, horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the Newcomen Engine, and later the Watt Engine. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses. Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input fuel into useful work. In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output. Hence the need for a new science of engine dynamics was born.\nMost cite Sadi Carnot's 1824 book \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\" as the starting point for thermodynamics as a modern science. Carnot defined \"motive power\" to be the expression of the \"useful effect\" that a motor is capable of producing. Herein, Carnot introduced us to the first modern day definition of \"work\": \"weight lifted through a height\". The desire to understand, via formulation, this \"useful effect\" in relation to \"work\" is at the core of all modern day thermodynamics.\n\nIn 1843, James Joule experimentally found the mechanical equivalent of heat. In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819 ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of conservation of energy and explained why heat can do work.\n\nIn 1850, the famed mathematical physicist Rudolf Clausius coined the term \"entropy\" (\"das Wärmegewicht\", symbolized S) to denote heat lost or turned into waste. (\"\"Wärmegewicht\"\" translates literally as \"heat-weight\"; the corresponding English term stems from the Greek \"τρέπω\", \"I turn\".)\n\nThe name \"thermodynamics\", however, did not arrive until 1854, when the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) coined the term \"thermo-dynamics\" in his paper \"On the Dynamical Theory of Heat\".\nIn association with Clausius, in 1871, the Scottish mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated a new branch of thermodynamics called \"Statistical Thermodynamics\", which functions to analyze large numbers of particles at equilibrium, i.e., systems where no changes are occurring, such that only their average properties as temperature T, pressure P, and volume V become important.\n\nSoon thereafter, in 1875, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann formulated a precise connection between entropy S and molecular motion:\n\nbeing defined in terms of the number of possible states [W] such motion could occupy, where k is the Boltzmann's constant.\n\nThe following year, 1876, chemical engineer Willard Gibbs published an obscure 300-page paper titled: \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\", wherein he formulated one grand equality, the Gibbs free energy equation, which suggested a measure of the amount of \"useful work\" attainable in reacting systems. Gibbs also originated the concept we now know as enthalpy H, calling it \"a heat function for constant pressure\". \nThe modern word \"enthalpy\" would be coined many years later by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes,\nwho based it on the Greek word \"enthalpein\" meaning \"to warm\".\n\nBuilding on these foundations, those as Lars Onsager, Erwin Schrödinger, and Ilya Prigogine, and others, functioned to bring these engine \"concepts\" into the thoroughfare of almost every modern-day branch of science.\n\nThe idea that heat is a form of motion is perhaps an ancient one and is certainly discussed by Francis Bacon in 1620 in his \"Novum Organum\". The first written scientific reflection on the microscopic nature of heat is probably to be found in a work by Mikhail Lomonosov, in which he wrote:\n\nDuring the same years, Daniel Bernoulli published his book \"Hydrodynamics\" (1738), in which he derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with the walls of a container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume. Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with Gottfried Leibniz's \"vis viva\" principle, an early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion as a result of his experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that he was thinking of the \"vis viva\" principle.\n\nJohn Herapath later independently formulated a kinetic theory in 1820, but mistakenly associated temperature with momentum rather than \"vis viva\" or kinetic energy. His work ultimately failed peer review and was neglected. John James Waterston in 1843 provided a largely accurate account, again independently, but his work received the same reception, failing peer review even from someone as well-disposed to the kinetic principle as Davy.\n\nFurther progress in kinetic theory started only in the middle of the 19th century, with the works of Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, and Ludwig Boltzmann. In his 1857 work \"On the nature of the motion called heat\", Clausius for the first time clearly states that heat is the average kinetic energy of molecules. This interested Maxwell, who in 1859 derived the momentum distribution later named after him. Boltzmann subsequently generalized his distribution for the case of gases in external fields.\n\nBoltzmann is perhaps the most significant contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy of particles with their degrees of freedom. The Boltzmann equation for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of thermodynamic probability as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.\n\nThe following list is a rough disciplinary outline of the major branches of thermodynamics and their time of inception:\n\nConcepts of thermodynamics have also been applied in other fields, for example:\n\nEven though he was working with the caloric theory, Sadi Carnot in 1824 suggested that some of the caloric available for generating useful work is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling to come to terms with the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the heat death of the universe.\n\nIn 1854, William John Macquorn Rankine started to make use in calculation of what he called his \"thermodynamic function\". This has subsequently been shown to be identical to the concept of entropy formulated by Rudolf Clausius in 1865. Clausius used the concept to develop his classic statement of the second law of thermodynamics the same year.\n\nThe phenomenon of heat conduction is immediately grasped in everyday life. In 1701, Sir Isaac Newton published his law of cooling. However, in the 17th century, it came to be believed that all materials had an identical conductivity and that differences in sensation arose from their different heat capacities.\n\nSuggestions that this might not be the case came from the new science of electricity in which it was easily apparent that some materials were good electrical conductors while others were effective insulators. Jan Ingen-Housz in 1785-9 made some of the earliest measurements, as did Benjamin Thompson during the same period.\n\nThe fact that warm air rises and the importance of the phenomenon to meteorology was first realised by Edmund Halley in 1686. Sir John Leslie observed that the cooling effect of a stream of air increased with its speed, in 1804.\n\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele distinguished heat transfer by thermal radiation (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777. In 1791, Pierre Prévost showed that all bodies radiate heat, no matter how hot or cold they are. In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black-body radiation. Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 Macedonio Melloni demonstrated that black-body radiation could be reflected, refracted and polarised in the same way as light.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell's 1862 insight that both light and radiant heat were forms of electromagnetic wave led to the start of the quantitative analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, Jožef Stefan observed that the total radiant flux from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the Stefan–Boltzmann law. The law was derived theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1884.\n\nIn 1702 Guillaume Amontons introduced the concept of absolute zero based on observations of gases. In 1810, Sir John Leslie froze water to ice artificially. The idea of absolute zero was generalised in 1848 by Lord Kelvin. In 1906, Walther Nernst stated the third law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn 1900 Max Planck found an accurate formula for the spectrum of black-body radiation. Fitting new data required the introduction of a new constant, known as Planck's constant, the fundamental constant of modern physics. Looking at the radiation as coming from a cavity oscillator in thermal equilibrium, the formula suggested that energy in a cavity occurs only in multiples of frequency times the constant. That is, it is quantized. This avoided a divergence to which the theory would lead without the quantization.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also Secretary of State for Air between 1921 and 1922. He won the Bronze medal with the British polo team in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nFrederick Edward Guest was born in London, the third son of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne (1835–1914) and Lady Cornelia Spencer-Churchill (1847–1927). The Guest family had made its fortune in the iron and steel industry in the 18th and 19th centuries and had married into the aristocracy. The Wimbornes were Conservatives who had been friends of Benjamin Disraeli. His mother was the eldest daughter of the John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough.\n\nGuest's four brothers were also politically active, with Ivor Guest serving as 2nd Baron, 1st Viscount Wimborne, a junior minister, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In addition, Henry Guest and Oscar Guest were Members of Parliament (MPs), while Lionel Guest (1880–1935) was a member of the London County Council. His sister Frances Charlotte Guest (1865–1957) was married to Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, who served as Viceroy of India.\n\nGuest was a first cousin of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, and Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe as well as a nephew of Conservative politician Lord Randolph Churchill, George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough, and Lady Anne Emily Spencer Churchill who was married to the 7th Duke of Roxburghe. His cousin, the 8th Duke of Roxburghe, was married to American heiress Mary Goelet, the only daughter of Ogden Goelet.\n\nEducated at Winchester, Frederick Guest chose the military profession. He was commissioned as second-lieutenant in the Infantry militia, East Surrey Regiment, and promoted to lieutenant on 7 April 1894. After apprenticeship in the militia, Guest was on 15 May 1897 appointed an officer in the 1st Life Guards, and promoted to lieutenant in that regiment on 23 November 1898. He was sent to Egypt in 1899, and in late November that year was part of a Camel Corps during the operations leading to the defeat of the Khalifa (mentioned in dispatches 25 November 1899). He served in South Africa during the Second Boer War from 1901, returning home in late June 1902, following the end of hostilities. Back in the United Kingdom, he returned to a regular posting with his regiment in September 1902. He was decorated for bravery, and rose to captain before retiring from active duty in 1906.\n\nIn 1904, during the controversy within the Conservative Party over adopting protectionism, Guest and other members of his family followed his cousin and close friend, Winston Churchill, into the Liberal Party in support of free trade — and perhaps also to accelerate their political careers. In 1906 Guest became private secretary to Churchill, by then a junior minister in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberal government. Guest attempted three times to enter the House of Commons before winning the vote in the East Dorset seat in the January 1910 general election. Although he remained unseated because of election irregularities by his constituency agent, he was reelected in December 1910. Known in the political world as \"Freddie Guest,\" he was a popular backbencher, became a Liberal Party whip in 1911, in the same year was elected a charter member of the cross-bench Other Club of political insiders, and was appointed Treasurer of the Household (Deputy Chief Whip) in 1912.\n\nWhen the First World War began in August 1914, Guest returned to active service as aide-de-camp to Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force in France. Guest performed confidential missions for French, liaising with the War Office and with political leaders. In 1916 Guest served in the East African theatre of war and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. After being invalided out of the army following serious illness, Guest resumed his political career. In May 1917 he joined Lloyd George's Coalition government as joint Patronage Secretary of the Treasury - effectively chief whip for the Coalition Liberals. On 3 December 1917 Guest sent Lloyd George a 14-page memo stating that although only around a third of Liberal MPs were staunch supporters of his predecessor H. H. Asquith, the time was not yet right to oust him from the Liberal leadership.\n\nGuest was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\", and in 1921 was promoted to Secretary of State for Air, a post he held until the Coalition fell from power in October 1922. In the general election of November 1922 Guest lost his seat but in 1923 was returned for Stroud, then in 1924 for Bristol North. After losing as a Liberal in the 1929 election, he rejoined the Conservative Party, winning as a Conservative for Plymouth Drake in 1931 and remaining in this position until his death.\n\nGuest competed for Great Britain in polo at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The British Polo team received the Bronze Medal. He played alongside Frederick W. Barrett, Dennis Bingham and Kinnear Wise.\n\nGuest can be found among the winners of the Roehampton Trophy. He would also lend horses to the English polo team for the International Polo Cup matches.\n\nIn 1905, Guest married Amy Phipps (1873–1959), daughter of American industrialist Henry Phipps (1839–1930), at St George's, Hanover Square in London. Amy was prominent as a women's suffragist, philanthropist and aviation enthusiast and owned valuable property in Long Island. The couple were frequent visitors to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. They had a daughter and two sons who became American citizens:\n\nApart from his political career he was an amateur motor racing driver and aeroplane pilot. In 1930, he became deputy master of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, and master in 1932. He also played polo, was a big-game hunter in East Africa, and was a celebrated man-about-town in London and New York City society. Among his homes was Villa Artemis in Palm Beach, Florida and the former du Pont estate in Roslyn, New York. He was a member of the River and Links Clubs of New York and the Piping Rock Club in Long Island. He was also a friend of the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII.\n\nGuest died from cancer in 1937, at the age of 61.\n\n"}

He has been a drummer since the age of 16, while attending St. Catherine's High School (Racine, Wisconsin), and has been an actor since the age of five. While attending the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, he auditioned for and was accepted into Theatre X in 1976, and worked with them in various roles for more than 20 years.\n\nAs a drummer, DeLorenzo paired up with bassist Brian Ritchie in 1980, as a rhythm section they called \"Violent Femmes\". When singer, guitarist, and songwriter Gordon Gano joined them in 1981, the band kept the name. DeLorenzo's father loaned the band $10,000 to record their eponymous debut album in 1982. However, the band was forced to delay its release until 1983 after they signed to Slash Records.\n\nDeLorenzo's signature sound is a result of his minimalist drum kit. He often uses nothing more than a snare drum, a tranceaphone and steel brushes. The tranceaphone consists of a metal bushel basket inverted over a tom. He favors this style of kit because in their early days, the band often played on the streets.\n\nDeLorenzo continued to act with Theatre X, and record and tour with the Femmes until 1993, when he left to devote more time to acting and to recording his own music. He toured as part of Moe Tucker's band in that year. In 1996 he opened a recording studio called \"Joe's Real Recording\". He has released three solo records since 1990. In addition to recording his own music, he has played with several side projects, including Ash Can School. In 2000, he teamed up with Ritchie to put together a Femmes compilation, and subsequently rejoined the band until it disbanded again in 2009. In March 2013, Gano, Ritchie and DeLorenzo reformed Violent Femmes once more and played a homecoming show at the Summerfest music festival in their native Milwaukee. Three months later, in July, the band announced a new line-up with Dresden Dolls member Brian Viglione as the band's drummer. DeLorenzo confirmed in a statement that he had left the Femmes permanently because of a failure of the band members to resolve their long-standing business disputes.\n\nDeLorenzo performs percussion in the chamber rock duo Nineteen Thirteen with cellist Janet Schiff. Nineteen Thirteen's recording of \"Hurricane Noel\" was featured in the 2011 TED Global Conference.\n\n\n"}

The device consists of a number of circular plates with tabs or perforations, fitted very close to each other in a sealed drum. Alternate plates are connected to a driving shaft at one end of the assembly and a driven shaft at the other end. The drum is filled with a dilatant fluid, often silicone-based, to about 80% by volume. When the two sets of plates are rotating in unison, the fluid stays cool and remains liquid. When the plates start rotating at different speeds, the shear effect of the tabs or perforations on the fluid will cause it to heat and become nearly solid because the viscosity of dilatant fluids rapidly increases with shear. The fluid in this state will effectively glue the plates together and transmit power from one set of plates to the other. The size of the tabs or perforations, the number of plates, and the fluid used will determine the strength and onset of this mechanical transfer.\n\nThis type of device essentially differs from fluid couplings such as torque converters by using the viscosity of the medium to transfer torque, rather than its momentum. This makes it potentially useful even on very small scales and requires less cooling. The torque transmitted is sensitive to the difference in speeds of the input and output but is almost independent of their common rate.\n\nViscous couplings are used as the center differential in some four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles.\n\nThe first mass-produced viscous couplings for a permanent 4WD off-road-capable vehicle was in the AMC Eagle, which was produced from 1980 to 1988 model years. The AMC Eagle's single-speed model 119 New Process central differential used a viscous coupling filled with a liquid silicone-based material. It linked the front and rear differentials for quiet and smooth transfer of power to the axle with the greatest traction, on wet or dry pavement.\n\nViscous couplings are used as the center differential in cars such as the Toyota Celica GT-Four, and also as a limited slip differential (LSD) in rear axles. They offer a cheaper way to implement four-wheel-drive than technologies like the mechanical-transfer Torsen differentials used by Audis.\n\nVolvo, Subaru, Land Rover, Vauxhall/Opel, and many others have also used viscous couplings in their drivelines at various times. They are now mostly superseded by electronically controlled devices.\n\nTony Rolt is often credited with the original idea and development as applied to automatic couplings in vehicle transmission systems, particularly four-wheel drive, working with Freddie Dixon at the time. Ferguson Research and FF Developments were the companies formed (1970s) to commercialise much early work into 4WD systems and devices. It is thought that GKN Driveline own any remaining worldwide \npatents today and offer several variants and combinations of Viscous Couplings integrated with other driveline components. \n\n\"Visco\" is a trademark of the Behr GmbH, Stuttgart.

{"id": "2281827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281827", "title": "Puerto Rican tody", "text": "Puerto Rican tody\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody (\"Todus mexicanus\") is a bird native to the island of Puerto Rico. Despite its scientific name, the Puerto Rican tody is endemic to the island and is locally known as \"San Pedrito\" (\"Little Saint Peter\").\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody makes up one of the five endemic \"Todus\" species of the Greater Antilles. Hispaniola has two endemic species, while Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico each have one. The Puerto Rican tody differs from the other Greater Antilles todies in that it is the only species without pink or yellow-green colored feathers on its flanks.\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody is the closest relative to the motmots of Central America. It is thought that the Jamaican tody (\"Todus todus\") gave rise to the Puerto Rican tody after hurricane dispersals, but the relationship between both species has not yet been confirmed. Studies show the \"Todus\" group probably developed before the Pleistocene. Mitochondrial gene studies point to the motmots as their closest relative, although egg white protein electrophoresis studies suggest a relationship to kingfishers.\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody is a small, brightly colored, non-passerine forest bird. It is one of the smallest representative of the order Coraciiformes, with an average body length of 11 cm and weight of 5 to 6 g. The upperparts of the Puerto Rican tody are an emerald green color, and it has light-yellow flanks and underside tail coverts, and a white belly and chest. The \"San Pedrito\", also known as \"Medio Peso\" by the local people, has a red throat and lower bill, which in itself is long and broad. It can be as long or longer than the head, and as half as long as the wing. Their legs and feet are a brownish color and the tarsus is similar in length to the bill. Both males and females have a short tail, ranging from two-thirds to three-fourths as long as the wings. Males and females are not sexually dichromatic, and their only difference is their eye color; males have gray eyes whereas females' eyes are white. The young have similar colored feathers as the adults, but lack the red markings, have a grayish colored belly and have shorter bills.\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody can be found throughout the main island of Puerto Rico. It is found predominantly in forested areas, especially in high-altitude damp forests where insect concentrations are higher, as well as in dense thickets, such as the Guánica Forest located in the southern region of the island.\n\nTodies have small territories. In lowland forests the tody's territory size is approximately 0.7 hectares (1.8 acres), but in higher elevations, where insect prey is less abundant, the territory size can increase up to two hectares per pair. Breeding territories are centered around the nest burrow and are smaller than their home ranges which are defended by the pair year-round.\n\nWhen the Puerto Rican tody encounters an intruder it fluffs up and raises its crest. If disturbed, a bobbing up and down motion accompanied by vocalizations is portrayed; though both males and females are capable of this display, males tend to bob more. This bobbing display has also been seen after feeding and during nest building. Chasing intruders, wing flicking and wing rattles are also some of the other exhibited displays. The majority of these territorial defense displays is reserved for other todies, as they tend to be very tolerant of other species.\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody is primarily insectivorous (85.9% of its diet). Todies eats katydids, grasshoppers, crickets, earwigs, dragonflies, flies, beetles, spiders (8.2%), and occasionally small lizards (3.5%) and frogs. Todies are considered voracious eaters.\n\nTodies forage and feed using different methods, including air-feeding and leaf feeding, the latter being the most common method of foraging. When they leaf feed they sit quietly in high perches and scan the surface below with fast, jerky head motions, often tilting their bills upwards. When the tody sees an insect on a leaf, it will capture it while in a short-curved flight.\n\nWhen todies air-feed, they have their bills pointed upward, and they fly from the perch snatching the insect and return to a different perch. Todies feed from different surfaces; the most common is leaves and the least common is the ground. The act of perching between foraging flights lasts for an average of 9.0 seconds and reach an average of 1.0 captures per minute in rain forests and 1.7 captures per minute in dense thicket habitats.\n\nThe nestling's diet is different. Adults primarily feed their nestlings with the insects Homoptera (30%), Coleoptera (25%) and Lepidoptera (16%); but they have been found to supplement the hatchling's diet with fruits from \"Clusia krugiana\" (18.4%). Apart from insects and seeds, the adults also feed their nestlings frogs and lizards, although between those two, frogs are more common.\n\nThe species has single broods and is monogamous. Its courtship reaches its peak between February and May and occurs in the breeding area, not far from the nesting site. The ritual consists of chasing each other while rattling the wings. Both male and females achieve a \"flank\" display before copulating, where they fluff out their flanks causing a spherical ball appearance. The female lifts her tail and enters into a submissive posture to facilitate copulation. During courtship their vocalization becomes agitated and accelerated.\n\nThe Puerto Rican tody has an unusual nesting technique. During and eight week period, the male and female todies excavate a 25 to 35 cm long, narrow burrow with a right angle in an earth bank. They create their nest at the end of this burrow. This process usually occurs between the months of February and June, before the start of the wet season. Females start laying their eggs 3 to 4 weeks after the nest has been completed. The female lays 1 to 4 bright white eggs, with an average of 2.3 eggs, on consecutive nights. The weight of each egg is equivalent to about one quarter of the females body weight. The responsibility of incubating the eggs is shared by both the male and the female for an average of 21 days, and later on other adult todies (usually previous offsprings) may assist in the development process of the chicks after the chicks have fledged. If nestlings are killed, as well as during incubation and brooding, the mate will bring prey items to the nest.\n\nThe clutch size and breeding productivity of this species seems to be greater in shaded coffee plantations compared to species in secondary forests in the north-central area of the island. Todies use half the burrows they excavate. Of all the burrows excavated in their territory, 62.5% and 33% of the nests in dense thickets and rainforest habitats are used respectively. Even though every year new burrows are excavated, 89% of them are 10 meters away from the old ones.\n\nPuerto Rican todies are rarely seen on the ground; they usually prefer perching, unless when nesting. When todies are on the ground they hop. An unusual fact is that to enter their burrow they have a favorite perching spot on which they land before heading to their nest. The Puerto Rican tody, unlike other Coraciiformes, roosts alone in trees both during the day and at nighttime. \nThe Puerto Rican tody has been researched extensively because of its unusual body temperature, body temperature control and temperature control abilities. Puerto Rican todies exhibit lower body temperatures than other todies, and have also exhibited heterothermy over a range of temperatures. Most coraciiformes have a body temperature of 40 °C, but Puerto Rican todies can maintain a body temperature of 36.7 °C. This allows them to spend 33% less energy than other Coraciiformes. Puerto Rican Todies can lower their body temperatures by 14 °C.\n\nThis physiological response varies by both season and sex; only females in breeding season are capable of becoming torpid, although not all individuals become torpid at the same body temperature. During this torpid stage, they are unresponsive, have their eyes closed and erected plumage, but are capable of taking flight soon after an increase in temperature.\n\nThis tody is a common endemic species to the island of Puerto Rico. It is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. During the past, the Puerto Rican tody suffered from human predation as it was captured as food. Currently it suffers from nest predation by introduced Indian mongooses. Other threats include habitat destruction and the transition of shaded coffee plantations into sun coffee plantations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281834", "title": "New Mexican cuisine", "text": "New Mexican cuisine\n\nNew Mexican cuisine is the cuisine of the Southwestern US state of New Mexico, the region is primarily known for its fusion of Pueblo Native American with Hispano Spanish and Mexican cuisine originating in Nuevo México. This cuisine had adaptations and influences throughout its history, including early on from the nearby Apache, Navajo, and throughout New Spain and the Spanish Empire, also from French, Italian, Mediterranean, Portuguese cuisine, and European cafés, furthermore during the American territorial phase from cowboy chuckwagons and Western saloons, additionally after statehood from Route 66 American diners, fast food restaurants, and global cuisine. Even so, New Mexican cuisine developed in fairly isolated circumstances, which has allowed it to maintain its indigenous, Spanish, and Mexican identity, and is therefore not like any other Latin food originating in the contiguous United States.\n\nIt can be easily distinguished from other Mexican and American cuisines, due to its emphasis on New Mexican spices, herbs, and flavors; especially red and/or green New Mexico chile peppers, anise (used in bizcochitos), and piñon (used as a snack or in desserts). It is also identifiable by the presence of foods and dishes that originate in New Mexico, such as Native American frybread-style sopapillas, breakfast burritos, enchilada montada (stacked enchiladas), green chile stew, carne adovada (pork marinated in red chile), carne seca (a thinly sliced variant of jerky), green chile burgers, posolé (a hominy dish), slow-cooked frijoles/beans (typically pinto beans), and calabacitas (a sautéed zucchini and summer squash dish).\n\nPrior to the establishment of New Mexico's current boundaries, Santa Fe de Nuevo México's land claim encompassed the Pueblo peoples and also oversaw the land of the Chiricahua, Comanche, Mescalero, and Navajo. The Spaniards brought their cuisine which mingled with the indigenous. They introduced wheat, rice, beef, mutton/lamb, among other foods and flavors, to the native corn, chile, beans, squash, and other indigenous ingredients. During this early development period the Horno, an outdoor beehive-shaped earth oven, became ubiquitous in Pueblo and Hispano communities. This distinct history—combined with the local terrain and climate—has resulted in significant differences between the cuisine of New Mexico and somewhat similar styles in Northern Mexico, and other Southwestern US states such as California, Arizona, and Texas.\n\nMany residents in the north and the capital, Santa Fe, are descended from Spanish noblemen and explorers who came in the 16th century. Nuevo México also took part in the Mexican revolution and the development of early Mexican culture. \"Anglos\" and African Americans traded and settled after the Civil War. New Mexico's population includes Native Americans who have been on the land thousands of years. Most recently, Asian and Indochinese immigrants have discovered New Mexico.\n\nWhen New Mexicans refer to chile they are talking about pungent pods, or sauce made from those pods, not the concoction of spices, meat or beans known as Texas chili con carne. While chile, the pod, is sometimes spelled chili, chilli, or chillie elsewhere, US Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico made this state's spelling official in a sense, by entering it into the \"Congressional Record\".\n\nOne of the first authors to publish a cookbook describing traditional New Mexican cuisine was educator and writer Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert, who published \"Historic Cookery\" in 1931. Her work helped introduce cooking with chiles to the United States more broadly.\n\nNew Mexico chile is the defining ingredient of New Mexican food. Chile is New Mexico's largest agricultural crop. Within New Mexico, green chile is also popular in non-New Mexican cuisines including Mexican-style food and American food like cheeseburgers, french fries, bagels, and pizza. \n\nThe New Mexico official State Question is \"Red or green?\" This refers to the choice of red or green chile with an entrée. \"Christmas,\" a relatively new tradition originating in the 1980s, is a request for both (one side covered with green, the other with red). New Mexico red and green chile have such a rich and distinctive flavor that traditional preparations require few additional flavoring ingredients. The essence of New Mexico chile preparation is its simplicity.\n\nThe New Mexico green chile is a variety of the chile pepper, \"Capsicum annuum\", and was developed as a recognizable strain in New Mexico by the late nineteenth century. It is available today in several distinct and selectively-cultivated strains called cultivars. The chile pepper is grown in the state's very high altitude (4,000–8,000 ft) and dry, hot climate. Much like grapes for wine, these growing conditions contribute, along with genetics, to giving New Mexico green chile its distinctive deep green color, texture, and flavor. The climate of New Mexico tends to increase the capsaicin levels in the chile pod compared to pods grown in other regions. This results in the possibility of hotter varieties. New Mexico green chiles can range from mild to extremely hot. At harvest time (August through the middle of October) green chile is typically roasted, peeled and frozen for the year ahead. Chile is such a staple in New Mexico that many national restaurant chains offer New Mexico chile at their New Mexico locations.\n\nNew Mexico red chile is simply the fully ripened green chile pepper. As it ripens, it first turns orange and then quickly turns red. As it does so, the skin thickens and fuses to the inner fruit or \"meat\" of the pepper. This means that, for the red pepper to be enjoyable, it must first be dried then blended into a puree. The puree can be made using full red chile pods or red chile powder (which is made by finely grinding the dried pod). The purée is not edible until cooked as \"red chile sauce\". This is made by cooking the puree with garlic, salt – and occasionally oregano – and has the consistency of tomato soup. Discerning native New Mexicans prefer sun-dried over oven-dried red chile, as the oven-drying process gives it a non-traditional smoky flavor and a dark maroon color. Red chile peppers are traditionally sun-dried in bundles called , which are a common decorative sight on porches and in homes and businesses throughout the Southwest. The process of creating the ristra is highly labor-intensive, so the ristra in recent decades has become a predominantly decorative item.\n\nThe bulk of New Mexico chile is grown in the Hatch Valley in the south of the state, in and around the village of Hatch. It is also grown along the entire Rio Grande Valley, and Chimayo in the north is also well known for its chile.\n\nPiñones, or piñon nuts, are a traditional food of Native Americans and Hispanos in New Mexico that is harvested from the ubiquitous piñon pine tree. The state of New Mexico protects the use of the word \"piñon\" for use with pine nuts from certain species of indigenous New Mexican pines. The harvest doesn’t generally arrive in full force until after New Mexico’s first freeze of the winter.\n\nWheat flour tortillas are more prevalent in New Mexico cuisine as a table bread than corn tortillas. However, corn tortillas, corn tortilla chips, and masa are the foundations of many traditional New Mexico dishes, and sometimes made of blue corn. Common traditional dishes include enchiladas, tacos, posole, tamales, and sopaipillas and honey served with the meal. However Corn (maize) remains a staple grain, the yellow sweet corn variety is most common in New Mexico, though white is sometimes used, and blue and red flint corn varieties are used for specialties like and blue-corn tortilla chips. Kernel corn and corn on the cob are frequent side dishes, as in the American South. Corn is not a frequent component of New Mexico or Pico de gallo, and is usually a separate side dish in and of itself.\n\nAnise is common in some desserts, especially the state cookie, the bizcochito. Cilantro, a pungent green herb (also called Mexican or Chinese parsley, the seeds of which are known as coriander) used fresh in salsas, and as a topping for virtually any dish; not common in traditional New Mexican cuisine, but one of the defining tastes of Santa Fe style. Cumin, the quintessential \"Mexican food\" spice, is used very differently in New Mexican food, usually reserved for spicing ground beef and sometimes other meats for burritos, tacos, and nachos. It is not used to flavor red and green chile sauces. Oregano is a sparingly used but common herb used in traditional New Mexican dishes.\n\nThe early Spanish Colonies along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico used safflower as a substitute for saffron in traditional recipes. An heirloom variety originating from Corrales, New Mexico called \"Corrales Azafran\" is still cultivated and used as a saffron substitute in New Mexican cuisine.\n\n\nThere have been several restaurants and restaurant chains serving New Mexican cuisine.\n"}

The catalog lists 9,110 objects, of which 9,095 are stars, 11 are novae or supernovae, and four are non-stellar objects which are the globular clusters 47 Tucanae (designated HR 95) and NGC 2808 (HR 3671), and the open clusters NGC 2281 (HR 2496) and Messier 67 (HR 3515).\n\nThe catalogue is fixed in number of entries, but its data is maintained, and it is appended with a comments section about the objects that has been steadily enhanced. The abbreviation for the catalog as a whole is BS or YBS but all citations of stars it indexes use HR before the catalog number, a homage to the catalog's direct predecessor, published in 1908, named the \"Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue\".\n\nThe earliest predecessor of the YBS, titled \"Harvard Photometry\", was published in 1884 by the Harvard College Observatory under the supervision of Edward Charles Pickering, and contained about 4,000 stars. Following its release, Pickering promoted a broader stellar survey for the southern celestial hemisphere, equally as thorough as the \"Harvard Photometry\" of 1884. This photometry work was carried out by Solon I. Bailey between 1889 and 1891, leading to the publication of the \"Revised Harvard Photometry\" in 1908. The new catalogue contained stars down to magnitude 6.5 in both hemispheres, for which John A. Parkhurst continued work through the 1920s.\n\nThe Yale Bright Star Catalogue has been steadily enhanced since the Yale astronomer Frank Schlesinger published the first version in 1930; even though the YBS is limited to the objects already in the catalog, the data for the objects already listed is corrected and extended, and it is appended with a comments section about the objects. The edition of 1991 was the fifth in order, a version that introduced a considerable enhancement of the comments section, to a little more than the size of the catalogue itself. This most recent edition, in addition to several previous editions, was compiled and edited by Ellen Dorrit Hoffleit of Yale University.\n\nTo date, there have been one predecessor, and five editions of the YBS Catalog:\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on Columbia Records in November 1971, one year after its predecessor, \"Christmas and the Beads of Sweat\". The album is Nyro's only all-covers album, and she interprets mainly 1950s and 1960s soul and R&B standards, using Labelle as a traditional back-up vocal group.\n\nNyro had originally hatched the idea to do a covers album during 1970, and on her tour to support the \"Christmas and the Beads of Sweat\" album she introduced several of the songs that would later appear on \"Gonna Take a Miracle\", including \"Spanish Harlem\" and \"Dancing in the Street\".\n\n\"Gonna Take a Miracle\" remains a critics' favorite Laura Nyro record for its laidback atmosphere and impressive soul grooves and musicianship, as well as classic \"Philadelphia soul\" production from Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. It was her last commercially successful album, peaking at #46 on the \"Billboard\" 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart, as well as #41 on the Black Albums chart.\n\nThe album was Nyro's last for over four years as she turned her back on the music industry to get married and live a rural life away from the spotlight. Her work with Patti LaBelle on the album formed a lifelong friendship.\n\nIn 2005, music magazine \"The Word\" voted \"Gonna Take a Miracle\" among the 60 Best Underrated Albums of All Time.\n\nNyro first met Patti LaBelle in 1970 when she was about to give an interview to LaBelle's manager Vicki Wickham. Wickham brought LaBelle along to the interview, where she engaged in deep conversation with Nyro. They went on the road together, with LaBelle cooking for Nyro.\n\nThe album was recorded in May and June 1971 at Sigma Sound Studios, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The producers were Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Patti LaBelle and her vocal partners in Labelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash, were brought in as backing singers.\n\nNyro was the main selector of material for the album, and chose songs she was influenced by growing up in the Bronx of the 1950s and 1960s. The songs include The Shirelles' \"I Met Him on a Sunday\", The Originals' \"The Bells\" (written by Marvin Gaye), Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\", Ben E. King's \"Spanish Harlem\", The Charts' \"Deserie/Desiree\", Major Lance's \"The Monkey Time\" (written by Curtis Mayfield)., and The Royalettes' \"It's Gonna Take a Miracle\".\n\nThe album balances the grittier numbers with the more ethereal soul ballad, \"The Wind\" and the sultry love ballad, \"Désiree\". Nyro, Labelle and Gamble and Huff mixed genres including doo-wop, soul, R&B, pop, Brill Building, and gospel. \"Despite Gamble and Huff's presence on the project, Nyro remained fully in charge.\"\n\n\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Legacy imprint of Columbia Records reissued the album in remastered and expanded format. The additional tracks were all recorded live at New York's Fillmore East and were later issued on the live album \"Spread Your Wings and Fly: Live at the Fillmore East May 30, 1971\". They are \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\", \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", \"Ooh Child\" and \"Up on the Roof\", all fitting with the covers theme of the original album.\n\nThe reissue features photographs and recording details, as well as new liner notes by Amy Linden and a back-cover personal recollection by Patti LaBelle. The reissue was released alongside similar versions of \"Eli and the Thirteenth Confession\" and \"New York Tendaberry\", and were produced and directed by the same Columbia/Legacy team.\n\n"}

Best known for his appearances with Pro Wrestling NOAH in Japan and Ring of Honor in the United States, Morgan received tryouts with World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation in 1997 and 1998, but was not hired.\n\nVassos graduated from Ripon Christian High School in 1994 at the age of eighteen, and attended Modesto Junior College for a year before deciding to become a professional wrestler. He left college at the age of twenty and attended the APW Boot Camp in Hayward, California where he was trained by Michael Modest and Ric Thompson for two years. He debuted in All Pro Wrestling on June 29, 1996 in Hayward, California as \"Donovan Morgan\", facing Dwayne Jones.\n\nSoon after his debut, Morgan began feuding with his trainer, Michael Modest. Morgan's first title win in APW was on January 25, 1997, when he and his partner, Robert Thompson, defeated Modest and Steve Rizzono for the APW Tag Team Championships in a Two out of three falls match, winning two straight falls. They held the titles until August 1, when they lost to Tony Jones and Jay Smooth. Morgan continued his feud with Modest, and on July 7 they faced one another in a match for the vacant APW Universal Heavyweight Championship. Modest was victorious, but Morgan continued to pursue the title, eventually defeating Modest for the Universal Heavyweight Championship on September 5 in what was considered a major upset. Modest regained the title less than a month later on October 3.\n\nIn early 2000, Morgan formed a stable with Vinny Massaro and Vanilla Frost called \"The New Breed\". On April 15, 2000 Morgan defeated Boyce LeGrande for the APW Internet Championship in the finals of a one night tournament (the previous champion, Christopher Daniels, had been signed by World Championship Wrestling and subsequently stripped of the belt). After Morgan won the Universal Heavyweight Championship for a second time, defeating Ed Moretti on October 7, 2000, he was informed by APW Commissioner Gabe Ramirez that he was not allowed to hold two titles simultaneously, so he vacated the Internet Championship on October 28.\n\nAfter Morgan lost the Universal Heavyweight Championship to Vic Capri on April 28, 2001 he immediately began pursuing the Internet Championship once more, beating Vinny Massaro on May 19. He was stripped of the title on November 27 after he left APW along with Modest and several other wrestlers following a disagreement with APW owner Roland Alexander.\n\nUntil he left APW, Morgan acted as the head camp instructor of the APW professional wrestling school. He was replaced by Spanky and The American Dragon.\n\nMorgan formed a tag team with Modest known as \"Excellence, Inc.\", and the duo began touring Japan with the NOAH promotion on July 14, 2001. Morgan and Modest became Noah regulars, often facing Japanese legend Mitsuharu Misawa. Morgan and Modest formed a stable in Noah with fellow gaijins 2 Cold Scorpio and Bison Smith known as Team KAOS.\n\nAfter leaving All Pro Wrestling, Morgan and Modest decided to open their own gym, \"The Tetsu Academy\". They later opened their own promotion in conjunction with the training center, \"Pro Wrestling Iron\", which held its first show on May 31, 2002 in Ukiah, California. Morgan and Modest eventually negotiated a talent swap agreement with Noah that saw Japanese wrestlers such as Misawa, Naoya Ogawa, and Takao Omori appear on PWI shows. Morgan and Modest continued to team in PWI and defeated Los Maximos in a match to decide the first ever PWI Tag Team Championships on June 11, 2004. They lost the titles to Frank Murdoch and Bart Blaxton on January 8, 2005. In addition, they continue to train wrestlers at the Tetsu Academy. August 31, 2005 marked the end of the Tetsu Academy, with a final show at the PWI dojo in Hayward, California on August 27, 2005.\n\nOn September 21, 2002, Morgan and Christopher Daniels, known collectively as The Prophecy, won a tournament to crown the first ever ROH Tag Team Champions, defeating Modest and his partner, The American Dragon. They held the titles until March 15, 2003, when they were defeated by A.J. Styles and Amazing Red. Morgan and Modest left ROH soon after following disputes over accommodation and schedule clashes with their Japanese commitments.\n\nOn the February 18, 2006 episode of \"TNA Impact!\", Morgan teamed with Michael Modest and Ryan Drago as La Migra. The trio were defeated by The Latin American Xchange. On the March 3, 2006 episode of \"TNA Xplosion\", Morgan and Modest were defeated by The Naturals.\n\nOn October 21, 2007, Vassos, as Chicano Flame, appeared at Wrestle Fan Fest 2007,\nand wrestled National Championship Wrestling (NCW) World Champion the New York Gangster on the AWA show in a non-title match in the Cow Palace in Daly City, California.\n\nMorgan became a mortgage broker in 2006.\n\n"}

{"id": "2281886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281886", "title": "Michaels cuebid", "text": "Michaels cuebid\n\nThe Michaels cuebid is a conventional bid used in the card game contract bridge. First devised by Michael Michaels of Miami Beach, FL, it is an 's cuebid in opponent's opening suit and is normally used to show a two-suited hand with at least five cards in each suit and eight or more points.\n\nAfter the opponents have opened at the one-level, the overcaller bids the same suit at the two-level; the two normal cases are:\n\nPartnerships who have incorporated Michaels cuebid amongst their agreements usually also play the unusual notrump convention.\n\nPoint count requirements vary and are a matter of partnership agreement. It is commonly agreed that a Michaels cuebid is constructive and should be made on hands that hold the prospect of winning the auction; hand emphasis is on trick-taking capability suggesting for suits containing most of the HCP and having good texture, particularly at unfavourable vulnerability. \n\nWith less than eight points, Michaels is not recommended - the chances of winning the auction are small and gives the opponents too much information. Bidders expecting to make or sacrifice can use basic Michaels at all point ranges with eight or more. In a common variant, known as Mini-Maxi Michaels, candidate hands are classed into three ranges and Michaels is applied more selectively:\n\nInitially, partner should assume a weak hand by the Michaels bidder; with a strong hand, the Michaels bidder will follow with a second non-forced call. Responses to the Michaels cuebid include: \n\n\nSeveral modifications and extensions exist, such as the Modified Michaels cuebid, Leaping Michaels and Super Michaels.\n\nIn the Netherlands, a particular modification is growing in popularity: over opponent's opening, a cuebid shows a major and a minor unbid suit. The 2NT overcall is then used to show both majors (after a minor suit opening) or both minors (after a major suit opening). This approach allows all three two suiters in the three unbid suits to be indicated. Compared to standard Michaels, the disadvantage is that after an opposing minor suit opening, one cannot introduce a two suiter in the majors at the two-level. Also, the cuebid invariably leaves one of both suits unspecified.\n\nA variant often referred to as \"upper cuebid\" is popular in Germany. In this treatment a cuebid shows the highest unbid suit and another unspecified suit. Together with the unusual notrump convention to indicate the lowest of the two unbid suits, this approach allows all two suiters in the three unbid suits to be indicated. Compared to standard Michaels, the disadvantage is that after an opposing minor suit opening, one cannot describe a two suiter in the majors in one bid.\n\nAlso, Michaels cuebid variants exist that remove any ambiguity on what is the second suit. An example is the \"hi-hi cuebid\" that over opponent's opening invariably shows the highest unbid suits. Together with the unusual notrump convention to indicate the lowest of the two unbid suits, this hi-hi cuebid allows two out of the three possible two suiters in the unbid suits to be specified in one single bid. A drawback of this method is that the hi-hi cuebid does not cater for two-suiters in the highest and lowest unbid suits.\n\nThe opening side may defend against a Michaels cuebid or any other conventional two-suited overcall with the Unusual vs. Unusual convention. This defense assigns conventional meanings to a double and to cuebids of the suits shown by the two-suited overcall.\n\nGhestem is more precise in terms of uniquely defining the specific suits denoted. Another drawback compared to Ghestem is that following an opposing minor suit opening, the Michaels cuebid used in combination with the unusual notrump convention does not cater for a two-suiter in spades and the other minor. Hands like these can only be indicated by overcalling 1 and, if possible, later introducing the minor suit. However, Ghestem has the disadvantage that after a 1 of a minor opening, you cannot choose a major at the two level, as the cuebid to show both majors is 3 . Another two-suited overcall system defining both suits explicitly is CRO (Colour, Rank, Other) which has similar advantages and disadvantages to Ghestem. It is also possible to use combinations of the bids that show all the two-suiters explicitly while allowing both majors to be bid at the two-level, such as RCO and SpoDo (Specific Michaels). However, all methods explicitly showing both suits in all combinations lose a natural bid, usually the 3C overcall which can otherwise be useful as a weak or pre-emptive jump overcall.\n\n"}
{"id": "2281891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281891", "title": "John Charles Thomas", "text": "John Charles Thomas\n\nJohn Charles Thomas (September 6, 1891December 13, 1960) was an American opera, operetta and concert baritone.\n\nJohn Charles Thomas was born on September 6, 1891 in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania. He was the son of a Methodist minister of Welsh descent while his mother, of German immigrant stock, had been an amateur singer. After studying initially for a medical career, Thomas won a scholarship to the Peabody Institute in Baltimore in 1910. He remained there for two years, receiving vocal tuition from Adelin Fermin.\n\nIn 1912, Thomas left the Peabody and toured briefly with a musical troupe. He then went to live in Manhattan, New York City, where he performed with a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta company before being contracted by the Shubert brothers to perform in the show \"The Peasant Girl\", which opened in March 1913. For the next nine years, he starred in a series of hit Broadway musicals including \"Her Soldier Boy\", \"Maytime\", \"Naughty Marietta\", and \"Apple Blossoms\" (with Fred and Adele Astaire).\n\nThomas sang in a concert performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's opera \"Sadko\" at Manhattan's Carnegie Hall in December 1924. His debut in a fully staged opera occurred in March 1925, as Amonasro in a production of Verdi's \"Aida\", presented by the semi-professional Washington National Opera.\n\nThomas was earning a great deal of money singing on Broadway but he wanted to gain more experience in opera. During the 1922-28 period, he spent part of each year in Europe, polishing his singing technique and appearing under contract at La Monnaie opera house in Brussels for the seasons of 1925-27. He would return to La Monnaie for 25 more performances in 1928, eight in 1930 and four in 1931. Even more importantly, he appeared with the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin in productions of \"Faust\" at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in July 1928.\n\nHe continued to give recitals in the United States during this period and, in 1923, acted in a silent film, \"Under the Red Robe\", directed by Alan Crosland. He made recordings, too, for the Vocalion label (1920–24) and Brunswick Records (1924–29), before signing with RCA Victor in 1931. Thomas also became a pioneer of radio broadcasts, in both New York and Florida. From 1929-32 he was a member of the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company, and in 1930 made one appearance with the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company.\n\nHe accepted engagements with the Washington National, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia opera companies, and in 1934, to satisfy a public demand, he was signed by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. He would remain at the Met until 1943, performing opposite such stars as the soprano Rosa Ponselle.\n\nIn the tough Great Depression years of the 1930s, he established himself as one of the most sought-after singers in America, with both a classical-music following and a considerable popular audience. His concerts normally offered selections from both repertoires: classical and operatic to begin, and American art songs and humorous \"character\" songs to close. He also appeared regularly on commercial radio programs. These included \"Five-Star Theater\" (in 1932-33 with the Joseph Bonime Orchestra), the Vince Radio Program (1934–36), the Ford, General Motors and The Magic Key of RCA shows (1937–40) and the Coca-Cola show (1940–41).\n\nIn 1938, he helped Edwin Lester launch the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, appearing in the company's very first production in \"Blossom Time\". This work was derived from a Viennese operetta \"Das Dreimäderlhaus\", with music arranged from that of Schubert and adapted for American audiences by Dorothy Donnelly and Sigmund Romberg. Thomas sang regularly in operettas with the LACLO until 1942, starring in productions of \"The Gypsy Baron\", \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"The Chocolate Soldier\" and \"Music in the Air\".\n\nThe Second World War made concert touring inconvenient, and very high taxes made it non-remunerative. Thomas was duly engaged to star on the Westinghouse Radio Program in 1943-46, accompanied by the Victor Young Orchestra. He probably reached his widest audience during this period, although his practice of performing songs exclusively in English has perhaps left him less well-remembered by today's musical \"purists\" than he should be. Nevertheless, many songs tailored for him to sing have gone on to become standards, such as the version of \"The Lord's Prayer\" by Albert Hay Malotte and the arrangement of \"Home on the Range\" by David W. Guion.\n\nThomas was among the founders of the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory in 1947.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1948, Thomas undertook a long and demanding tour of Australia and New Zealand, where he played to crowded theatres. He retired bit by bit from the concert stage after 1950, and settled in Apple Valley, California in 1955 with his wife Dorothy.\n\nHe died there in December 1960 from cancer. Owing to his high-spending lifestyle, the fortune that he had earned through singing was largely dissipated at the time of his death.\n\nHis home in Apple Valley has been designated as one of the town's historic sites.\n\nThomas appeared twice as a contestant on the TV quiz program \"You Bet Your Life\", hosted by Groucho Marx. These episodes aired on 5 December 1957 and 12 December 1957. He was a strong vocal opponent of rock-and-roll music during the first appearance and debated the subject with advocate Roberta Rene during the second.\n\nJohn Charles Thomas left a large pool of audio recordings, many of which sold extremely well in their day and have been transferred in recent times to compact disc. Only a handful of these recordings, however, are devoted to opera arias. His operatic voice is probably best appreciated in commercial offerings such as \"Nemico della patria\" from \"Andrea Chénier\", and \"C’en est fait… Salomé demande\" from \"Hérodiade\". Live broadcast recordings of \"Per me giunto\" from \"Don Carlos\", \"Vien Leonora\" from \"La favorite\" and \"Il balen\" from \"Il trovatore\" display his brilliant top notes and bel canto capabilities.\n\nHe sang hymns, art songs, ballads, cowboy tunes, introspective German lieder, and shanties.\n\nThomas belonged to a sequence of leading American operatic baritones whose overlapping careers stretched in an unbroken line from the 1920s through to the 1990s. They included Richard Bonelli, Lawrence Tibbett, Arthur Endrèze (who was based in Paris), Leonard Warren, Robert Merrill, Cornell MacNeil, Sherrill Milnes and Richard Fredricks.\n\nHis lyric voice was more notable for its free top register than for its lower range. It was particularly suited to the French operatic repertoire, in which he was seldom heard in the United States apart from his Athanael in Massenet's \"Thais\". It had remarkable flexibility, which was enhanced by Thomas's energy and expressiveness, particularly in his repertoire of popular material. In operatic work, however, this skill could be shown to good effect in trills and runs. Notable examples of his technical expertise are displayed his versions of \"Il balen\" from \"Il trovatore\", and the \"Drinking Song\" from \"Hamlet\".\n\nIn common with a lot of singers of his inter-war generation, Thomas's voice was highly distinctive. In part, this may have been due to his early career on Broadway. He knew how to \"sell\" a song—to build a stirring aria to a climax that would bring audiences to their feet. While the voice was always unmistakably his, it changed noticeably in character over time. His early recordings display a darker tonal hue, and the voice is stiffer, as though he were imitating the stentorian Italian baritone of a previous generation, Titta Ruffo. By 1931, and certainly by 1934, he had found the more fluid, natural vocal style for which he is best remembered. From the late 1940s into the '50s, his vibrato began to widen, though it never became an unpardonable flaw in his singing technique, and the voice grew somewhat thicker and heavier in tone.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first book of the tetralogy, followed by the books \"1935 and Other Years\" (, 1989), \"Fear\" () and \"Dust and Ashes\" ().\n\nPrincipally told through the story of the fictional Sasha Pankratov, a sincere and loyal Komsomol member who is exiled as a result of party intrigues, the novel is semi-autobiographical - Rybakov too was exiled in the early 1930s. The book recounts the growing hysteria of the period where simple mistakes or humour were seen as examples of sabotage or acts of wreckers (cf \"The Joke\" by Milan Kundera). In effect the book exposes how, despite the honest intentions of Pankratov and older Bolsheviks like Kirov, Stalinism is destroying all their hopes.\n\nThe novel is also notable for its portrayal of Joseph Stalin as a scheming and paranoid figure.\n\nThe book, which was written between 1966 and 1983, was suppressed until the Perestroika era (published for the first time as a \"feuilleton\" in 1987). It was a great publishing sensation of that era, being so direct in its criticism of the Soviet system, seemingly honest in its portrayal of Stalin and harsh in its cynical view of those who turned the Soviet Union into a \"Great Power\".\n\nThe book was first published in English in 1988 by Dell Publishing, a division of Bantam Doubleday Dell.\n\n\n"}

It corresponds to the natural atoll of the same name. The administrative capital is located in Fonadhoo Island.\n\nTraditionally, Maldivians call this atoll simply 'Haddhunmathi', without adding the word 'Atholhu' at the end.\n\nIt is mostly rimmed by barrier reefs, the broadest of which are topped by islands. There are many islands along its eastern and southern boundaries.\n\nThis atoll is quite regular excepting for the projection of the reef at its NE corner (Isdhū Muli). It closely resembles Kolhumadulhu, its neighbour further north. Owing to its typical atoll shape, it differs in no respect from atolls in the Pacific Ocean, save for its greater size.\nIts reefs are generally of little breadth, with no signs of \"vilu\" (deep pools), except for its eastern fringes which are covered with islands that are quite large by Maldive standards. The lagoon is comparatively open, containing scattered shoal patches; the bottom is muddy and the average depth is from .\n\nLaamu Atoll forms the southern limit of Central Maldives. Beyond the Huvadhu Kandu, the broadest channel between atolls in the Maldives, lie the southern atolls.\n\nKadhdhoo Domestic Airport is located on Kadhdhoo.\n\nHaddhunmathi (Satu Duvu) atoll was playing an important role in the Maldives when the nation was a Kingdom. Many of the islands located on Laamu's eastern reef have important archaeological sites, like Dhanbidhoo, Mundoo, Gan and Isdhoo. These are remains of monasteries, viharas and stupas of large proportions.\n\nSome of the most ancient writings of the Maldives are the Isdhū Lōmāfānu and the Dhanbidhū Lōmāfānu copperplates, relating to the conversion to Islam, the destruction of the Buddhist monuments, the beheading of the Buddhist monks and the building of mosques to replace the Buddhist temples and monasteries. These copperplates are from the year 1193 AD. The Maldivian king back then according to these documents was Sri Gadana Aditya Maharadun.\nA tentative transcription of the Dhanbidū lōmafānu was made by M. Ibrahim Loutfi and was subsequently published in 'Faiytūra', the organ of the Maldivian Cultural Affairs Council.\nH. C. P. Bell excavated some of the Buddhist sites in 1923. The Stupa in Kuruhinna, one of the Buddhist sites in Gan Island, was remarkably well preserved. Only the Chattravali (Satihirutalu) was missing. Unfortunately these sites have been vandalized since then and there is almost nothing remaining now, except for a heap of stones and gravel. \nThe cause of heavy destruction during recent years has been archaeological excavations on those sites themselves. Regrettably, these investigations were either done carelessly, or left the site unprotected after excavation. The removal of the sheltering jungle exposed the site to subsequent vandalism. Often local inhabitants plundered the place in the vain hope of finding gold or other treasures, as soon as the archaeologists and accompanying government officials left the island.\nThe Dhanbidhū Lōmāfānu tells us that the Satihirutalu (the chattravali or chattrayashti crowning a stupa) were broken to disfigure the numerous stupas. It tells us also that statues of Vairocana, the transcendent Buddha of the middle world region, were destroyed; and the destruction was not limited to sculptures.\n\nThe wealth of manuscripts probably written on screwpine leaves that Maldivian monks in their Buddhist monasteries must have produced was either burnt or otherwise so thoroughly eliminated that it has disappeared without leaving any trace. Therefore, there are no samples of paintings from the Maldive Buddhist period itself. The only actual remains of the art of those times are a few sculptures and etchings on coral stone. Most of these are preserved in a little room in the Malé Museum, but many they are not properly labelled, so it is not easy to know where they come from.\n\nA Buddha head found by H.C.P. Bell during his excavations in this atoll has disappeared, but the picture taken by Bell can be seen in his Monograph.\n\nScenes from the 2016 film, \"\", were filmed here, specifically the scenes on the planet Scarif, which is portrayed as a tropical planet.\n\n\n"}

Owned by the Grand Junction Regional Airport Authority, it is the largest airport in western Colorado and third largest in the state, behind Denver International Airport and Colorado Springs Airport.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records show 212,588 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 228,850 in 2009 and 219,358 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nThe airport opened in 1930 as Grand Junction Municipal Airport. In 1942 it was renamed Walker Field for Walter Walker, a former publisher of \"The Daily Sentinel\" newspaper who helped obtain funds and business support for the airport. The airport and the airport authority were renamed on May 15, 2007. Grand Junction Regional Airport is undergoing a $20 million renovation, of which $700,000 will pay for signs with the new name. The airport's terminal and fire building will continue to be named for Walker and a new $19 million roadway under construction will be called Walter Walker Blvd. Tailwind Concessions provides food and beverages inside the terminal. A new runway will be built north of the existing one, with a target year of 2019. The present runway will become a taxiway. \n\nInside the terminal, the passenger waiting area has a gift shop and TV monitors. The terminal has three gates with jet bridges for regional jets; one other gate uses outdoor airstairs. Allegiant and American Eagle flights use gate 3 while Delta uses gate 4. United uses gate 6.\n\nThe airport covers 2,357 acres (954 ha) at an elevation of 4,858 feet (1,481 m). It has two asphalt runways: 11/29 is 10,501 by 150 feet (3,201 x 46 m) and 4/22 is 5,502 by 75 feet (1,677 x 23 m).\n\nIn 2016 the airport had 45,001 aircraft operations, average 123 per day: 60% general aviation, 27% air taxi, 7% military and 6% airline. In July 2017, 102 aircraft were based at this airport: 93 single-engine, 11 multi-engine, 6 jet, and 3 helicopter.\n\nThe first airliners at Grand Junction were Monarch Douglas DC-3s in 1946-47; successor Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) served Grand Junction until the 1980s. United Airlines Douglas DC-4s started flying LAX-LAS-GJT-DEN in 1947 and United continued that route until 1977. Nonstops from Grand Junction never reached beyond Denver, Salt Lake and Las Vegas until United started Saturday-only nonstops in the winter ski season to Los Angeles in 1969-70 and to Chicago in 1970-71 (GJT's runway was extended from 5400 to 7500 feet around 1965). Until the 1980s GJT was the only Colorado airport west of Denver to see airline jets. In 1974-75 United Douglas DC-8s flew nonstop to Los Angeles and Chicago while Boeing 727-100s flew to San Francisco; in 1976-77 United tried nonstop 727s to Detroit and Milwaukee and in 1978-79 to Omaha and Kansas City. United also operated the Boeing 727-200 from the airport. In winter 1980-81 Grand Junction finally got a weekday United Boeing 737-200 nonstop to LAX, but United ended mainline service to GJT a few months later.\n\nThe first jets at Grand Junction were Frontier Boeing 727-100s flying DEN-GJT-SLC and back starting Oct-Nov 1966. Some Frontier 727 flights flew direct to Kansas City and St. Louis. Boeing 737-200s later replaced Frontier's 727s, and their Convair 580s remained into the 1980s. In 1975-76 Frontier started weekend-only 737s to DFW during ski season.\n\nOther jet airlines at Grand Junction included Continental Airlines to Denver in the 1980s and early 1990s, flying Boeing 727-100s, 727-200s, 737-200s, Douglas DC-9-10s and DC-9-30s when Continental had a hub at Denver. Western Airlines Boeing 737-200s flew nonstop to SFO in winter 1975-76, and America West Airlines Boeing 737-200s flew nonstop to Phoenix in the 1980s. In the mid 1990s, Air 21 Fokker F28 Fellowships flew nonstop to Colorado Springs and Las Vegas and direct to Los Angeles.\n\nThe only mainline jets at Grand Junction now are Allegiant Air Airbus A319/320s twice a week nonstop to Las Vegas and Phoenix-Mesa - year round, and seasonal flights to Los Angeles; other airlines use regional jets.\n\n"}

Maryland was the first state to name a dog breed as a state symbol, naming the Chesapeake Bay Retriever in 1964. Pennsylvania followed the year after, naming the Great Dane as its official breed. Dog breeds are mostly affiliated with the states that they originated in. North Carolina chose the Plott Hound as it was the only dog breed indigenous to the state.\n\nOther official state dogs also are indigenous to their state, including the Boston Terrier (Massachusetts) and the Alaskan Malamute (Alaska). Pennsylvania selected the Great Dane not because of its origin, but because it was introduced by early settlers in the state to be used as a hunting and working dog; it was chosen over the Beagle, which was also proposed around the same time.\n\nTwo of the more recent successful campaigns to name a state dog have been started by schoolchildren. In 2007, Alaskan kindergarten student Paige Hill's idea created the campaign for the Alaskan Malamute which would convince Representative Berta Gardner to support the bill in 2009, with it becoming law in 2010. Elementary school students from Bedford, New Hampshire won their campaign for the Chinook to be accepted as a symbol of their state in 2010.\n\nThere have been a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog. Georgia was undecided about choosing a state dog in 1991, with an attempt to make the Golden Retriever the official dog failing after a vote in the Georgia State Senate; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog, the mascot of the University of Georgia. The campaign to make the Siberian Husky the Washington state dog failed in the Washington House of Representatives in 2004. In January 2019, Minnesota partnered with charity Pawsitivity Service Dogs to introduce a bill to make the Labrador Retriever the State Dog.\n\nIn 2006, New York State Assembly member Vincent Ignizio suggested that New York should adopt a dog as a state symbol, and during the campaign to name the western painted turtle as state reptile for Colorado in 2008, it was suggested by local press that the Labrador Retriever would be suitable as a symbol, even though it is not native to the state. While in Kansas as early as 2006, residents have suggested the Cairn Terrier as the state dog due to the breed's appearance as Toto in the film \"The Wizard of Oz\". In 2012, Representative Ed Trimmer tabled a bill proposing the Cairn Terrier as a state symbol. In 2015, the \"working dog\", animals that have been trained for various service roles, was adopted.\n\nAlthough South Dakota does not have a state dog breed, it does list the coyote—a canine species related to the dog—as its state wildlife animal. In Minnesota, legislation has been proposed on six different occasions to adopt the eastern timber wolf as the state animal. In 2013, Colorado listed rescue dogs and cats as the state pet. California also named the shelter pet as its state pet in 2015 because of all the abandoned shelter pets each year. California's legislature hopes this will cause more adoptions of pets from shelters.\n\nThe table below shows the dog breeds which have been proposed to each state's relevant State Senate or House of Representatives, but either were not accepted as a state symbol or are still pending nominations.\n"}

He was the country's first cricketing leader to achieve victory, both at home against the West Indies in 1956 and the first away win, against South Africa in 1962.\n\nReid was born in Auckland in 1928. Reid was also a strong and aggressive bowler who, in his early days, was an authentic quick. He later turned to off-cutters and spin from a short run-up with a trademark side-step. Until a swollen knee slowed down his movements and checked his agility, he was a strong and multi-talented fieldsman at slip and in the covers. On the 1949 tour of England he was the reserve wicketkeeper, keeping wicket in several matches including the final Test. \"The figures mislead,\" confirmed John Mehaffey, whose favourite Reid was. \"Nobody who saw him at the crease would dispute his own assessment that he could have increased his batting average by half again if he had played in the 1980s side with Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe.\"\n\nReid never featured in an England-beating New Zealand Test side, but his men secured a narrow first-innings lead against Dexter's eleven in the Third Test in Christchurch. Unable to take advantage, they collapsed at the hands of Fred Trueman and Fred Titmus for 159 in their second innings, of which Reid hit exactly 100 before stumbling from the field in pallid enervation. The second-highest score was 22. This remains the lowest all-out Test match total to include a century.\n\nIn 1969, Reid played in what is thought to be the first cricket match at the South Pole, with the striped barber's-type pole with a silver reflecting glass ball on top representing the actual Pole acting as the wicket. The match ended when Reid hit a six and the ball was unable to be found in the snow of the outfield. It has been noted that every shot he played, no matter where he hit it, travelled north. His son Richard played nine one-day internationals for New Zealand. On the death of Trevor Barber on 7 August 2015 Reid became the oldest surviving New Zealand Test cricketer.\n\nIn the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, Reid was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to sport, especially cricket. He was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, also for services to cricket, in the 2014 New Year Honours.\n\nReid wrote two books, \"Sword of Willow\" (1962) and \"A Million Miles of Cricket\" (1966). Joseph Romanos wrote the biography \"John Reid: A Cricketing Life\" in 2000. \"John Reid\" is a 55-minute DVD made by the Vid Pro Quo company in 2003 of interviews with Reid by Grahame Thorne and footage of matches he played in.\n\n"}

She rose to fame in 1980 with the hits \"Tyle samo prawd ile kłamstw\" and \"Wszystko czego dziś chcę\", the latter performed to a big success at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, accompanied by the popular Polish rock band Budka Suflera. Trojanowska immediately became one of the most popular singers of the early 1980s in Poland. Romuald Lipko, Budka Suflera's leader, composed eight tracks for her debut album, simply entitled \"Iza\" and released in 1981. The same year Trojanowska teamed up with another rock band, Stalowy Bagaż, with whom she recorded an EP and performed at the Opole Festival. Their performance drew controversies as the singer was wearing a red tie on stage, typical for the outfit of the members of Union of Polish Youth. The organisation accused her of profaning the Union. In the meantime, Trojanowska appeared in several Polish feature films and TV series.\n\nBy the early 1982, Izabela finished recording her second LP, \"Układy\". The album showcased rockier sound and spawned hits \"Brylanty\" and \"Karmazynowa noc\". Later that year, she paired with Tadeusz Nalepa for the album \"Pożegnalny cyrk\", whose politically charged lyrics strongly criticized martial law in Poland. That record was however withdrawn by censorship office. At that time, Trojanowska was criticized by both Solidarity and the communist government, and decided to emigrate from the country. Together with her husband, she moved to the Netherlands, the USA, the United Kingdom, before finally settling for Germany. She released two English language singles in the mid-1980s, but they turned out unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1990, Trojanowska released a self-titled, English language album, which was a commercial failure, spawning only a minor radio hit \"Independence Day\". In 1991, her first retrospective was released, consisting only of the early 1980s material, followed by the release of the shelved album \"Pożegnalny cyrk\" in 1993. Her next studio album was \"Chcę inaczej\", released in 1996 to warmer reception. It spawned a minor radio hit single \"I stało się\". In 1997, she accepted the role of Monika Ross-Nawrot in the hit soap opera \"Klan\".\n\n2006 saw the release of another compilation, which included five re-recordings of old hits. She teamed up with Polish band Mafia and started to work on new material. Her first studio album in 15 years, \"Życia zawsze mało\", was released in 2011 to minor success.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
